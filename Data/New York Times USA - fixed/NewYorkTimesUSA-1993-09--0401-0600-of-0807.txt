HEADLINE: THE 1993 PRIMARY: The Voters;
Casting Their Ballots, Looking for a Better City

BYLINE: By CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD

 BODY:
Talking of the need of the city and reflecting on Mayor David N. Dinkins's term at City Hall, voters went to the polls yesterday to cast their ballots and their hopes like pennies in a wishing well. They could not predict the outcome, they said, nor could they be sure that they would influence it much. But the act itself felt good.
As they cast their ballots in the Democratic primary for citywide offices, and in local races, many voters reflected on their years in the city and on how it has both changed and stayed the same. Some spoke with praise of Mayor Dinkins; others expressed contempt for his record. 
 Most spoke of the importance of voting and of their pride in a city like no other: harder, more expensive, more diverse, more competitive. Their city, good and bad.
In Borough Park, Morris Strassburger, 79, a native of Israel, said his mind was mostly on the November Mayoral race, when he plans to vote for Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate.
"It's terrible what's going on," he said. "A robbery here. A killing there. Riots sometimes in Crown Heights. It's terrible under Dinkins. Listen to me. Four years ago I voted for Dinkins. Now I change my mind."
 
Concern About Holtzman
 Across the city, among that small fraction that bothers to vote, the most consistent topics yesterday were the city's safety, or lack of it, troubles in the schools, public housing and the economy.
Alec Wallings, a long-time West Sider, said he was concerned about "guns, guns, guns, guns, guns" and the basic dignity of city politicians. He said he voted against Elizabeth Holtzman for Comptroller. He shrugged off the recent investigation that has marred her run for re-election. His real gripe, he said, was her tone: "It's an arrogance that needs to be slapped down by voters."
Betty Spector, a poll worker at Public School 9, at 100 West 84th Street in Manhattan, said, "I don't like either one of the two that are running for Mayor" in the November election. She said she considered Mr. Dinkins somewhat ineffectual and Mr. Giuliani too "law and order."
In addition, she said, "I don't like this fusion thing," a reference to Mr. Giuliani's decision to run with two Democrats, Herman Badillo for Comptroller and Susan D. Alter for Public Advocate.
"What if Badillo wins and Dinkins wins? I'm not sure that would work out," she said.
 
For Many, a Somber Mood
 In the Bronx, Bertram Bowers, 22, said, "We have to think about housing. About the homeless. About schools and education." He said he wanted to give Mayor Dinkins another term to finish what he had started.
In a voting station on Lenox Avenue in Harlem at midday, Eula Dalton, 67, a cleaning lady, said she had made a special effort to get to the polls because of what she saw as a plot by Mr. Giuliani to have Roy E. Innis, a Democratic challenger, siphon votes from the incumbent.
"Everybody's talking about Roy Innis and what is he even doing in this," she said. "He's just doing it so he can get a job with Giuliani. Even if I had never voted before I would have voted this time just to knock Roy Innis out."
 
Crime Affects Choices
 In Park Slope, Brooklyn, Rosie Jackson, 50, an assistant deputy director of the New York City Department of Human Resources, said her vote was cast in part because of her fear of crime.
"I'm a Southern black," she said. "We had to fight for the right to vote." This year, she said, her vote was a vote of protest against the Mayor. "I think he's been weak on crime and I don't think he's allowing the police to do their jobs," she said.
But there were voters who celebrated the exercise and the city it affects.
Dona D. Vaughn, 47, a stage director who has lived on the Upper West Side for 20 years, said she hoped those running would work to improve city services, schools and housing. But she also took a moment just to say how happy she is to call New York City home.
"There's no place like it," she said. "Here you are living in this big city. Yet you feel very much a part of it. And, really, everybody basically gets along."
Then, too, she said, there are the city's more sublime advantages. Ms. Vaughn brushed her hand over her freshly laundered blue jeans and said with a smile: "You can dress any way you like!"
And no politician has ever dared to mess with that.

HEADLINE: Investor Edginess Sends Dow Down 18.45

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
The edginess of stock market investors was on full display yesterday, as bad news about inflation pummeled the bond market and stocks quickly followed, though they found some equilibrium later in the day.
Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany, said the day began with nervousness among investors that "we'd get some bad news for the bond market, and we'd see the bond market decline sharply, and that would touch off a decline in stock prices." He added, "Those worries became a reality at 8:30 this morning."
 
A Jolt to the Market
 The jolt to the market was administered when the Labor Department said consumer prices had risen three-tenths of 1 percent in August, while expectations had been that the number would be no higher than two-tenths. The announcement revived fears of inflation, which had considerably abated. 
 "Even though that wasn't an alarming number, it was enough above expectations to touch off profit-taking," Mr. Johnson said. "the principal reason for the decline in stock prices today was the sharp decline that occured in bond prices, and the rise in long-term interest rates, which got lots of those edgy fence-sitters off the fence and got them into selling both bonds and stocks."
The Dow Jones industrials were down more than 25 points early in the day before recovering to close down 18.45, at 3,615.76. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 258.7 million, up from 245 million on Monday. Transportation stocks were hit hard, with the Dow Jones transportations down a sharp 22.23 points, to 1,612.53.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 2.16, to 459.90, and the American Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.54, to 452.76. The Nasdaq composite fell a whopping 7.68, to finish at 732.64, on particularly bad performances by a number of technology stocks.
The weakest sectors of the market were airlines, technology, automobiles and interest-rate-sensitive stocks like money center banks, regional banks and insurance companies, Mr. Johnson noted.
Technology stocks were brought to their knees across the board. Intel was down 1 1/2, to 63 1/4; Microsoft was down 1 1/8, to 75 1/4; Apple was down 1, to 24 1/4; Texas Instruments was down 1 3/8, to 75 3/4, and the Digital Equipment Corporation, down 1 5/8, to 40.
 
The Airlines Worst Hit
 Among airlines, worst hit was United Airlines, down 4 1/4, to 142 1/4. Delta was down 1 5/8, to 52 5/8, and Southwest Airlines was down 7/8, to 31 7/8.
Of the auto makers, the General Motors Corporationwas down 1 3/4, to 45 3/4; Ford Motor was down 1 1/4, to 53 3/4, and Chrysler was down 7/8, to 44 5/8.
An analyst for Paine Webber downgraded Bankers Trust and J .P. Morgan. Bankers Trust was down 2 1/2, to 80, and J. P. Morgan closed at 75 7/8, down 1 1/2. Another bank stock, Wells Fargo, fell 1 3/4 to 118 3/8.
Home Depot, long a darling of Wall Street, sank to 36 1/4, down 4, when Goldman, Sachs took the stock off its recommended list.
Another big decliner was the Cyrix Corporation, a semiconductor maker, which closed at 28 1/4, down 5 5/8, after Lehman Brothers reduced its earnings estimates.

HEADLINE: Narrow House Victory For S.& L. Cleanup Bill

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Ending months of debate and delay, the House of Representatives narrowly passed legislation today to complete the cleanup of the savings and loan industry.
Earlier this year, the Senate passed its own version of the legislation with $34 billion in total financing, compared with the $26.3 billion of the House version. A House-Senate conference committee will try to resolve the differences. 
 To satisfy Republican members whose support was needed to build a majority for the perennially unpalatable S.& L. bailout, leaders of the House Banking Committee presented a compromise that cut in half, to $8 billion, the amount of money taxpayers would contribute to a new insurance fund that would guarantee repayment of deposits in future S.& L. failures.
 
Restoring R.T.C. Authority
 At the same time, the legislation extends for another year and a half the operations of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which seizes the assets of bankrupt savings and loans and sells them to pay depositors. The R.T.C. had been scheduled to stop taking over S.& L.'s on Oct. 1.
The bill restores the authority of the R.T.C. to use $18.3 billion in previously appropriated funds for this purpose before the new insurance fund takes over the task.
The unwillingness of the House to commit tax dollars to future S.& L. failures has been the single biggest political obstacle to enacting a bill. Once the R.T.C. completes its work in 1995, deposits at S.& L.'s will be insured by the new fund, called the Savings Association Insurance Fund.
By whittling down the amount of Federal money available to the S.A.I.F., which is to be built up from deposit insurance premiums paid by savings and loans, the House bill would leave the industry facing a long period of relatively high deposit insurance premiums.
Some industry and Government experts warned that high premiums could cause problems.
"If adequate funds are not appropriated for the S.A.I.F., it is likely that S.A.I.F. member institutions would operate at an ongoing disadvantage to other financial concerns, and consequently would be less able to attract capital to maintain their financial health," said Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, in a recent statement to the Senate Banking Committee.
 
A Healthier Industry
 For the time being, most savings and loans, like most other financial institutions, are enjoying healthy profits as a result of low interest rates. Unless the economy turns sour, the bill's passage could mean the closing of one of the costliest financial traumas ever to face the nation.
Already, the R.T.C. has spent more than $86 billion cleaning up the S.& L. crisis, not counting interest payments.
The vote in the House was 214 to 208, with 24 Republicans voting for the bill. The differences between the House and Senate bills are not expected to be irreconcilable.
"I truly believe that this is the last time we will have to vote on the R.T.C.," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who is a senior member of the House Banking Committee.
 
The Cost of Delay
 Without the legislation, the R.T.C. has been left holding nearly 80 S.& L.'s and operating them at a loss, which has cost taxpayers an estimated $3 million a day, or more than $1 billion a year.
Many members of the House, especially Republicans, have adamantly opposed increasing the cost to taxpayers of the S.& L. debacle. Without a handful of Republican votes, the Democratic leadership had been unable for months to muster enough support to bring the bill to the floor for a vote.
The bill also calls for changes in management practices at the R.T.C., which has been criticized for inefficiency over the years. And it extends from three years to five years the statute of limitations for prosecuting some officials of S.& L.'s that went bankrupt.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Precious Metals Given a Lift From Latest Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Modest gains in retail sales and consumer prices gave precious metals a lift yesterday after two days of steep losses.
On other commodity markets, lumber futures fell sharply while oil futures rose. 
 Gold for October delivery rose $2.10, to $345.20 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. December gold, the most actively traded futures contract, also gained $2.10, to $346.90. September silver rose 6.7 cents, to $3.972 an ounce.
Gold had skidded $11.70 in the two previous sessions following Friday's Government report of an unexpected six-tenths of 1 percent drop during August in the Producer Price Index.
Traders were braced for a drop in retail prices, too, but the Labor Department said yesterday that the Consumer Price Index rose a moderate three-tenths of 1 percent in August after three months of virtually unchanged prices.
 
 
Retail Sales
 In addition, the Commerce Department said retail sales grew a modest two-tenths of 1 percent last month.
The numbers were hardly the sort to rekindle investor demand for gold as an inflation hedge. On the other hand, "it did show the economy was maybe not as bad as some people had thought," said Stephen W. Platt, an analyst with Dean Witter in Chicago.
The modest rise in consumer prices provided an excuse for traders who recently sold precious metal futures to buy them back at lower prices, said James Steel, metals analyst with the futures brokerage firm of Refco Inc.
The marginally positive economic data did not stem the slide in lumber futures prices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Spruce two-by-fours for November delivery plunged $7.40, to $309.40 for 1,000 board feet, after a $10 drop on Monday.
Meanwhile, light sweet crude oil for October delivery finished 1 cent higher at $16.96 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a day of seesawing prices. October heating oil climbed 0.35 cent, to 51.74 cents a gallon; October unleaded gasoline fell 0.41 cent, to 48.16 cents a gallon, and October natural gas fell 3.9 cents, to $2.157 for 1,000 cubic feet.

HEADLINE: Bond Deal Is Reviewed By G.O.P.

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 14

 BODY:
Searching for evidence that the Florio administration was incompetently, and perhaps even corruptly, being taken to the cleaners by a crafty Wall Street banking house, Assembly Republicans today opened their formal investigation of the state's bond-issuing practices.
The hearings, invested with the Republican majority's newly acquired power to subpoena witnesses, are focusing on a complicated, $1.8 billion deal entered into by the state with Lazard Freres & Company last December to refinance old debt at high interest rates, turning it into new debt at lower rates. 
 The Republicans, with an eye out for a corruption scandal that could be used against Gov. Jim Florio in his re-election campaign, maintain that Lazard Freres walked away from the deal with unreasonably high fees.
The State Treasurer, Samuel Crane, maintained in his appearance before the committee that the banking house had devised an innovative plan that saved the state millions of dollars in interest payments. The Treasury notes bought by the state from Lazard Freres as part of the deal came at a fair market price, Mr. Crane said, so the banking house's profit was not to the detriment of the state's taxpayers and voters.
 
Theater, or Substance?
 The hearings were conducted by the Assembly Appropriations Committee with the kind of legalistic pomp that day-time television viewers have come to expect from Congressional investigation and hearings by special prosecutors. Although the committee's subpoena power was not used in today's session, witnesses were elaborately sworn to tell the truth, read a Miranda-like caution of their rights as witnesses, and offered the chance to buy a tape recording of their testimony.
Mr. Crane, a veteran of many appearances before the Appropriations Committee, objected to having to raise his right hand this time. "Putting people under oath has more to do with theater than substance," he said.
Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, the chairman, again spurned the Democrats' charge of political grandstanding, as he had Monday when he appealed to the Assembly's two-to-one Republican majority for the power to subpoena witnesses.
"The process by which the state and its authorities issue bonds may be imperfect in many respects," he said before taking Mr. Crane's testimony. "But never in so many quarters where bonding is a common practice, whether it be the Treasurer's office, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, the Sports and Exposition Authority or the Health Care Facility Financing Agency, have there been so many rumors of self-dealing, personal gain and centralized management of both the fiscal and political details of bond issuances."
 
Aide to Florio
 A Justice Department investigation is under way into allegations of kickbacks in the underwriting of New Jersey Turnpike Authority bonds involving a company half owned by Joseph P. Salema, who was Gov. Florio's chief of staff until May.
Mr. Salema, maintaining that his interest in the firm, Armacon Securities Inc., was in a blind trust and that he had done nothing wrong, resigned soon after the existence of the investigation became public in May.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has also asked for bond records from the Sports and Exposition Authority in connection in the Armacon inquiry.
The December refinancing with Lazard Freres worked like this: The banking house underwrote the issuance of $1.8 billion in new bonds for the state, half of which was earmarked to retire old debt that was out at higher interest rates, and the other half to go into a series of funds for capital and debt payment outlays.
Because the old bonds had staggered call dates, the dates when the state can pay them off, the cash raised in the new bond sales was used to buy short-term Federal Treasury notes from Lazard Freres. The innovation that won Lazard the refinancing contract from the state, despite misgivings by some of Mr. Crane's own subordinates, was the way that the banking house arranged the sale of treasury notes whose maturity dates coincided with the call dates of the old bonds.
 
Test of the Deal
 Lazard Freres has not disclosed the size of its profit in selling Treasury notes to New Jersey. The Wall Street Journal has put the figure at $10 million, and that number was widely taken as fact at today's session.
Mr. Crane, however, argued today that the test of the deal was the low interest rate obtained by Lazard Freres for the $1.8 billion in new debt, not whatever profit the house made on notes that the state would in any case have had to buy elsewhere if not from Lazard.
The Republican critics of the deal argued that such a large refinancing should have been broken up among several underwriters, and put out to competitive bidding in an effort to drive down costs.
Because Lazard Freres was able to complete the deal before the end of last year, after first discussing it only in September, Mr. Crane said, the state saved $50 million.
The hearings will be resumed in about two weeks, Assemblyman Freylinguysen said. Witnesses have not been announced.

HEADLINE: Disney Considers Move Into Times Sq.

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company is talking to city and state officials about occupying a landmark theater on 42d Street at Times Square, city and state officials say.
The talks center on the New Amsterdam Theater, a graceful 10-story Art Nouveau building that was the home of the Ziegfeld Follies from 1913 to 1927 but has fallen into disrepair. Disney's representatives have discussed using the theater for live shows, said Carl Weisbrod, President of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. 
 "We have been in discussions with them, and obviously it would be terrific for 42d Street if Disney came to the block," Mr. Weisbrod said.
A person close to the project, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "There's a great deal of interest among entertainment users in 42d Street right now. The one that's farthest along -- although that doesn't mean it's going to happen -- is Disney."
When asked about the report, Thomas Deegan, a spokesman for Disney, said, "It's speculation, and we don't comment on speculation."
The reports of Disney talks came on the eve of a press conference scheduled for today at which city and state officials are to announce that they are proceeding with condemnation of the buildings on the northwest half of the 42d Street block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, as well as the buildings on the east side of Eighth Avenue between 42d and 43d Streets, for use in the project. The condemnation is being announced by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Mayor David N. Dinkins, who will be represented by Deputy Mayor Barry F. Sullivan. The addition is a big part of the remaining privately-held area in the redevelopment project.
 
Hiatus in Change
 Under the original 42d Street Redevelopment Project, a city and state development that was to use mostly private money, Times Square was to receive a $2.5 billion make-over. But plans by Park Tower Realty and the Prudential Insurance Company of America to build office towers there were shelved in August 1992 until economic conditions improved. By the time plans were suspended, many buildings had already been cleared of tenants.
The head of the state agency in charge of the development project confirmed the Disney talks but gave no details. "We are in discussions with Disney," said the official, Rebecca Robertson, the president of the 42d Street Development Project Inc., a subsidiary of the New York State Urban Development Corporation. "But I really can't characterize the discussions at all."
The cost of repairing the New Amsterdam would presumably be substantial, and it is not clear how much -- if any -- public money would be made available to the Disney organization to go forward with the theater. Mr. Weisbrod said, he "wouldn't want to get into a discussion of financial arrangements at this time."
In the spring of 1991, reports circulated widely that the New York City Opera was considering relocating from the State Theater at Lincoln Center to the 1,900-seat New Amsterdam Theater, which was the height of New York nightlife glamour in its heyday before the Depression, but has deteriorated badly. The talks never bore fruit, however, and the theater, which Ms. Robertson's organization acquired from the Nederlander Organization last fall, has stood empty and dark at 214 West 42d Street.
The New Amsterdam, which opened in 1903, has a luxurious interior of marble and classical friezes that was legendary even by the standards of the rich Broadway theaters of the time. The roof garden was turned into the swanky Midnight Frolic supper club by Florenz Ziegfeld in 1915. In 1937 the theater was converted for movies, and was used that way until 1982. The theater is on the National Register of Historic Places.
Mr. Deegan said Disney had a live show of "Beauty and the Beast" that was scheduled to open a New York run in the spring at the Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, where "The Will Rogers Follies" recently closed. "Disney's Symphonic Fantasy," a revue of song and dance from Disney movies, had a two-week run this summer at the Metropolitan Opera House.
 
Using Other Theaters
 Mrs. Robertson's organization also has jurisdiction over two other theaters, the Empire and the Harris.
Six other 42d Street theaters taken over by the city and the state during the 1990 condemnation for the original redevelopment project are under the jurisdiction of New 42d Street Inc., a nonprofit organization that is independent of Ms. Robertson's group and is responsible for the restoration and long-term management of those theaters. They are the Victory, the Lyric, the Times Square, the Apollo (also known as the Academy), the Selwyn and the Liberty.
Cora Cahan, the president of New 42d Street, said her group was "hoping and planning" to make an announcement in late September on its plans for "some of the theaters on 42d Street." She declined to discuss any specifics of the plans.

HEADLINE: Orchestras Sound Loud Notes Of Strife Over Money Matters

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
The managers of America's symphony orchestras have complained increasingly in recent years that the rising incomes of musicians and the trend toward extended concert seasons, coupled with cuts in government subsidies, have had a devastating effect on the bottom line. Now the managements of several small and medium-sized orchestras are fighting back, demanding salary and roster cuts and shaving the number of guaranteed performing weeks.
These moves, combined with the contract talks in progress at some of the larger orchestras, are making for a decidedly unharmonious concert season. 
 In recent weeks, the management of the Buffalo Philharmonic suspended operations and dismissed its musicians; the Honolulu Symphony canceled its first few weeks of concerts, and the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra in Minnesota said it planned to file for bankruptcy if its players did not agree to its proposals by Sunday. The Philadelphia Orchestra's contract expires the same day, and if a new agreement is not reached there, its players may call their first strike since 1966. That would leave Carnegie Hall without an orchestra to open its season on Sept. 23.
 
Strike in Washington

 
 The Kennedy Center Opera Orchestra has been on strike since Sept. 1, and the National Symphony Orchestra, which also performs at the Kennedy Center, has refused to cross the picket line. The National's own contract expired on Sept. 6, but the players have agreed to negotiate until Oct. 18; they are leaving for a Russian tour next week. The Cleveland Orchestra, the Atlanta Symphony and the Milwaukee Symphony are performing without contracts.
The only reason New York City's orchestras have been unaffected by this turmoil is that they have already faced something like it, though less severe. Last winter, a consortium of freelance orchestras struck for several weeks, and eventually won modest increases in benefits, as well as tenure guarantees. And the New York Philharmonic's contentious negotiations in 1991 led to a contract that gave the musicians some of the increases they sought and a voice in the running of the orchestra.
"The negotiations this year," said Liza Hirsch DuBrul, the lawyer representing the musicians in Milwaukee, St. Paul and Atlanta, "are marked by what I consider to be a very deliberate attack on the entire system of collective bargaining in the arts."
From the Kennedy Center musicians' point of view, that is exactly what is at issue in their strike. The talks broke down when the center said it wanted to eliminate contract provisions that guarantee the orchestra's 61 players 10 weeks of ballet performances each season. "If we need 40 musicians," asked the center's lawyer, Norman Samnick, "why should we hire 61? If we have six weeks of work, why should we pay for 10?"
 
50 Years in the Balance

 
 Leonard Leibowitz, the musicians' lawyer, describes the center's approach as union busting. "Orchestras have fought for job security for 50 years," he said, "and, having achieved it, to be told to go back to the bad old days is unacceptable."
But elsewhere, management is making sacrifices, too. In Milwaukee, management has taken pay cuts of from 4 percent to 7 percent, and has instituted a wage freeze. Zdenek Macal, the orchestra's music director, took a 7 percent pay cut and has agreed to forgo a 7 percent increase promised in his contract.
These and other belt-tightening measures are expected to save the orchestra $370,000. But last year, its deficit was $870,000, and its cumulative deficit is $2.2 million. Its $10 million endowment does not generate enough income to cover the shortfall. And although it is trying to attract donations to increase the endowment to $35 million, prospective donors have said that they will not give the orchestra money until its finances are stable. Orchestras elsewhere are hearing similar responses to their pleas for cash.
 
A Summer Problem

 
 Joan H. Squires, the Milwaukee orchestra's executive director, said one of the main problems was that several attempts to market a summer series had been unsuccessful. What she would like to do is drop seven summer weeks from the orchestra's contract, bringing its season to 41 weeks from 48. That would mean a 14 percent cut for the players, who made an individual minimum of $46,080 under the old contract.
"We've offered to have a summer task force," Miss Squires said, "with management, board and musician input into finding work for the summer. We're interested in exploring proposals. But we cannot commit to pay them for weeks if we don't know how we'll use them."
The situation in St. Paul is more complicated. In May, the Minnesota Opera attempted to redefine its relationship with its orchestra, saying its players were not employees. The Internal Revenue Service, the National Labor Relations Board and the state disagreed, and the musicians went on strike.
The opera company's management then formed an administrative alliance with the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and the Ordway Musical Theater and proposed making the St. Paul ensemble the resident orchestra for all the organizations. The players object to this proposal, although in some ways it would be good for them. With a contract that runs only 40 weeks, the players could use the extra work. And shared administrative costs would help management contend with an accumulated deficit of $1.55 million.
"We instantly acknowledged the fundamental intelligence of having three small arts organizations pool their administrative resources," Ms. DuBrul said. "But this proposal would mean that the St. Paul orchestra is being asked to become a strikebreaking orchestra for the opera. And the musicians won't do that."
The Milwaukee and St. Paul orchestras have agreed to play their concerts this weekend. But with the St. Paul management's bankruptcy ultimatum looming this weekend, that orchestra's future is uncertain. And neither union representatives nor management in Milwaukee were willing to say how long that orchestra would keep playing.
 
'We've Run Out of Cash'

 
 In Honolulu, the musicians have not picked up their instruments this season.
"Last year," said Tony Dechario, the orchestra's executive director, "we began the last year of a three-year contract with a deficit of $535,000. We asked the musicians to renegotiate, but they weren't interested in that. So in violation of the contract, I made unilateral cuts, which was the only way I could get through the year. The musicians filed a grievance, which they won, so now we owe them $450,000 back pay, which we have not yet paid them. Then the question of the new contract came up. Our problem is that we've run out of cash."
But Mr. Dechario can also see the battle from the musicians' point of view.
"The musicians' problem is that the salary minimum we're offering is only about $20,000 for a 38-week season," he said. "They're eligible for unemployment, which gives them another $7,000. But you can't live in Hawaii for that. They're frustrated because they don't see any progress. And I can understand that. But we're just a microcosm of what's happening nationally.
"What we need is for managements and unions to sit down and figure out new ways to generate revenue. Unfortunately, right now, everyone's so concerned about the wording of the contracts that we're driving each other further into the corner, and it's getting harder to find solutions to our mutual problems."

G.M. IS SAID TO BE CLOSE TO SALE OF NEW JERSEY PLANT

BYLINE: AP

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation is close to selling its Inland Fisher Guide plant in Ewing Township, N.J., to William D. Hurley, a New Jersey investor, a state official said yesterday. G.M. signed a nonbinding memorandum of understanding on Friday with Mr. Hurley, indicating that the two were negotiating terms of the proposed deal, said Barbara W. McConnell, New Jersey's Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development. She said the state might provide economic assistance to help Mr. Hurley and his company, Independent Component Systems of Farmingdale, N.J., make the acquisition. G.M. would say only that negotiations were continuing for the sale of the parts plant, situated just outside Trenton. The plant employs about 1,300 people who make door handles, seat adjusters and body moldings for automobiles.

Dollar Is Off After Report On August Consumer Prices

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar slipped against other currencies yesterday after a report of higher-than-expected inflation.
 The yen, meanwhile, surged in a broad rally spurred by huge sales of Australian dollars, Brazilian debt restructuring and a growing Japanese trade surplus.
 The dollar jumped briefly in reaction to news that the Consumer Price Index rose three-tenths of a percent in August, exceeding forecasts for a gain of a tenth of a percent. Higher inflation can push up the dollar if it nudges interest rates higher, since it increases yields on dollar-denominated investments.
 But a selloff quickly ensued when dealers recalled a long string of American economic data pointing to a slow recovery.
 "The data was a little stronger than the awful figures expected," said a dealer for an American bank in London. "When you get down to it, the recovery is moribund."
Rumors that European central banks were buying German marks to replenish intervention reserves also depressed the dollar. In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.6090 marks in New York, from 1.6110 on Monday. 
 Earlier, the dollar fell in Tokyo, as the yen surged on rumors of the sale of $1 billion (Australian) for yen. This led to a broad selloff that pushed the Australian dollar to a seven-year low despite aggressive intervention by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
 The Bank of Japan also stepped in to rescue the dollar as it slid further against the yen on $400 million to $600 million in sales by Japanese banks in Brazilian debt restructuring deals.
 Moreover, news that Japan's trade surplus had widened fanned fears that the United States would renew its call for a stronger yen to bolster Japanese imports.
 The dollar steadied at 105.98 yen in late New York trading, down from 106.27 yen on Monday, as dealers awaited Japan's economic stimulus package to announced tomorrow.

HEADLINE: Rivals Sound Themes in New York Mayoral Battle

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Bracing for the political fight of his career, Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday used the moment after his easy renomination to wrap himself in the support of top Democratic politicians at a pep rally, even as his Republican-Liberal rival, Rudolph W. Giuliani, pulled hard for the crossover Democratic voters he will need to win in November.
Surrounded by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, Labor Secretary Robert Reich and David Wilhelm, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, the Mayor marched to a lectern on the steps of City Hall, took off his suit coat and tie, and undid the top two buttons of his white shirt. Then he lit into the Republican policies that he said Mr. Giuliani represents and that he contends have hurt New York. 
 "We know where we stand," Mr. Dinkins told the midday crowd, reading from his text in the undramatic style he favors. "And we know where our Republican opponent stands: anywhere and everywhere he can. To him, pro-choice means choosing a different position every day. This election is a choice between dividing our city and uniting it."
 
Runoff on Sept. 28
 Hours later, Mr. Giuliani went to the same spot to receive the endorsement of City Councilman Michael DeMarco of the Bronx, a blunt-spoken regular Democrat and former Finance Committee chairman who has made it plain that Mr. Dinkins does not speak for the Councilman's overwhelmingly white middle- and working-class district.
"Next year this city is not going to be a partisan city, a Democratic or Republican city," Mr. Giuliani said.
The Mayor's defeat of his gadfly Democratic challengers, Roy E. Innis and Eric Ruano-Melendez, by better than 2 to 1 means that the rematch between Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani, which has sputtered and flared all year, can at last grow white hot. There will be one last sideshow, though: a runoff for the Democratic nomination for comptroller between the incumbent, Elizabeth Holtzman, and Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi of Queens, the first such runoff for a secondary citywide office in the city's history.
As low as turnout was in Tuesday's primary -- about one-quarter of the city's more than two million registered Democrats -- it is expected to be even lower in the Sept. 28 runoff. That could favor Mr. Hevesi, who has a field organization and support among organized labor, and further hurt Ms. Holtzman, who drew her strongest support in black districts where voters, without Mr. Dinkins at the top of the ticket, may just stay home.
Ms. Holtzman was invited to the rally but, a sudden pariah in her own party councils, she did not attend, preparing instead for a news conference on an official city report that found her "grossly negligent" in taking a bank loan for her failed Senate campaign from a company whose sister concern was later awarded lucrative city bond underwriting business. By contrast, Mr. Hevesi stood just behind the Mayor in the same frame as Mark Green, the party's nominee for the No. 2 spot, public advocate.
 
Politics of Blocks and Tackles
 That sideshow may distract from the Mayor's efforts to make his case against Mr. Giuliani, though yesterday, with just seven weeks until Election Day, both candidates' seconds made it clear that not only the campaign season but football season had begun, as they burst out in sports metaphors. The Mayor's aides warned that they were prepared to draw sharp comparisons and questions about Mr. Giuliani's record sooner rather than later, in paid television commercials, if necessary. Mr. Giuliani's team, happy with some recent polls that have shown their candidate in the lead, vowed to move straight ahead.
"You just keep driving between center and tackle," said Mr. Giuliani's strategist, David Garth. "Our way is fairly clear. A lot can be told by the way the Mayor handled himself last night, starting with the attacks. He didn't have to put out a road map to tell us where he's worried when he opens up speaking Spanish worse than I do."
The Mayor's campaign manager, Bill Lynch, asked about his boss's sharper tone, replied: "We're in campaign mode now. This is about running and tackling." Asked, in the patois of politics, if the Mayor would "go negative" on Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Lynch replied: "I don't rule out anything within the realm of campaigning. We're going to look at a number of options. My major concern is whether or not we can pull our coalition of 1989 together and expand on it and that we get the Mayor's record and vision out there."
The Mayor's supporters have been urging him for weeks to go on the offensive. Before the Mayor spoke yesterday, the Governor urged him in an unsually public exhortation to shake off his celebrated reserve.
"I don't believe David Dinkins got his due in 1989," Mr. Cuomo said. "I don't believe he got the vote he was entitled to in 1989. I don't believe he gets what he's entitled to now, in terms of credit. And I don't know exactly why.
"I have a suspicion. It may have something to do with his civility. It may have something to do with his unflappability. It may have something to do with the way he closes that double-breasted jacket. I don't know what it is. He's got this easy manner about him, and that civility maybe is mistaken for weakness.
 
'Marine Toughness'
 "He has kept this city together. And done what he did all through this terrible recession, with that high civility and Marine toughness. Maybe what he has to show a little bit more of, just a little bit more, David, is a little bit more of the Marine toughness.
"I don't want you to lose your civility, but just show us a little bit more of the rest, and then finally he will get his due, which is not a victory on Nov. 2, it will be an enormous triumph, a huge triumph for David Dinkins."
Mayoral aides said Mr. Dinkins had made the uncharacteristic decision to shuck his suit coat before the Governor's advice.
One participant in the rally had a special role: Mr. Green, who handily won the Democratic nomination to be the city's chief ombudsman, pledged to campaign hard for the Mayor he would be sworn to monitor if he won.
"It is an anomolous situation," Mr. Green acknowledged. "I look forward to doing everything I can to see that David Dinkins is the next Mayor so next year I can be the watchdog looking over his shoulder."

HEADLINE: Guarded Optimism for Peace Ushers In Jewish New Year

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG

 BODY:
Letty Cottin Pogrebin, a writer, came back to Manhattan from the historic handshake in Washington with a feeling of euphoria, ushering in the Jewish New Year last night with chicken soup (her mother's recipe), brisket and a palpable -- though guarded -- sense of hope.
"I who love language have been reduced to the most ordinary cliches," said Ms. Pogrebin, chairwoman of Americans for Peace Now, a Zionist advocacy group. "So here goes: I never thought I'd live to see the day. I couldn't believe my eyes. It's a dream come true." 
 Avi Weiss, an Orthodox rabbi, on the other hand, returned to the Bronx depressed, his spirit damped for the High Holy Days. "I'm so worried that what lies on the horizon is a mortal threat to Israel," he said before the holiday began at sunset yesterday. "I'm going to have to tell my congregation that I'm emotionally and spiritually drained on the eve of Rosh ha-Shanah."
 
A New Year Like No Other
 Across New York and the country, American Jews began their 10-day observance of the High Holy Days charged with mixed emotions after a historic week in which Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization signed an agreement that raised the possibility of peace in the Middle East. As they shared round challah and dipped apples in honey, as they walked to synagogue at sunset and prayed to be inscribed in the book of life, their emotions ran the gamut.
But whether jubilant, skeptical or furious about the accord, most agreed that this was a New Year like no other, a New Year that could transform the political and emotional landscape of American Jewry -- for better or worse.
And so rabbis feverishly rewrote their sermons to accommodate this defining moment.
On the Upper West Side, some progressive Jews, like Ms. Pogrebin's family, sang Hebrew peace songs over dinner. And in Borough Park, Brooklyn, many Orthodox Jews said they would pray as if this year were no different from any other -- but acknowledged that the week's events would color their emotions.
At 3 P.M. yesterday, Aaron Braun, a 36-year-old Orthodox Jew, pushed a cart of holiday dinner fixings out of Landau's Supermarket, which calls itself "the kosher inflation fighter."
"We are going to pray for peace, for the well-being of the world, as we always do," he said. "But we cannot rely on guns, we cannot rely on agreements. We can only rely on God."
 
Coincidence of Events
 In contrast, Margie Ostrove, a 27-year-old money-market trader doing last-minute shopping at Zabar's on the Upper West Side, said that a peace agreement was a very good start.
"I think we're just looking at the holiday as more of a beginning this year," she said. "We're more excited than usual -- not that we're cooking Palestinian foods yet, mind you."
Despite the last-minute preparations, many religious leaders said they relished the coincidence of events, that such a momentous time in Jewish history fell on the eve of the Jewish New Year.
"The timing means the Jews will be getting their direction on this not so much from Dan Rather and the secular Jewish leadership, but from their rabbis," said Rabbi Susan Grossman, who leads Genesis Agudas Achim, a Conservative congregation in Tuckahoe in Westchester County. "I cannot get over the fact that this happened this week, when the whole focus of Jewish life is on changing, having hope and looking toward the future. I mean, we always looked to the Middle East and said it's never going to change and here it did."
On Tuesday and Wednesday, Rabbi Jerome Davidson of Temple Beth-El, a Reform synagogue in Great Neck, L.I., who said he writes his best sermons under extreme deadline pressure, struggled to find a way to impart his own uplifted feelings at the possibility for change. He joked about borrowing President Clinton's speechwriter, and grew somber at the prospects for shaking his congregants loose from "the deep-seated stereotypes into which they have been frozen."
"They've been raised to see all of these Arab leaders' faces as the enemies'," he said. "Now somehow they have to be persuaded to let that image of the handshake -- halting as it may have been -- sit alongside or even eclipse some of the mental pictures of the intifada or Munich."
Rabbi Arthur Schneier, the senior rabbi at the Orthodox Park East Synagogue in Manhattan, said he would call for guarded optimism from a congregation that he described as "bewildered and anxious." His congregants want to believe that peace is imminent, but cannot quite let go of their distrust, he said.
"It has been said that Jews are paranoid but, I think, based on our history of persecution, we have a right," said Rabbi Schneier, a Holocaust survivor. "Nonetheless, by nature, we are a faith of optimism. We are blessed not only with the faculty to remember, but the capacity to forget. Personally, I would be paralyzed if I were to live through, on a daily basis, the loss of my family to the gas chambers, my experience of the beast and brutality in man. And as a people, we would be paralyzed if we clung to well-worn enmities of the conflict in the Middle East."
Still, many rabbis have a hard time preaching whole-hearted hopefulness. Rabbi Susan Schnur of Princeton, N.J., said that many Jews, conditioned to expect suffering, find good news hard to assimilate.
"The prayerbook is really a catalogue of Jewish tsuris, a catalogue of misery," said Rabbi Schnur of the progressive String of Pearl Congregation. "Good things don't happen to Jews overtly, and when they do, it feels dangerous."
Rabbi Balfour Brickner, the senior Reform rabbi emeritus at the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue in Manhattan, however, had no hesitation about delighting in the peace agreement.
"This dove is crowing, you better believe it," said Rabbi Brickner, an advocate of peace for 25 years, noting that the main response in the occupied territories was jubilation. "You didn't seen the walls of Jericho go down in flames. You saw them festooned with flowers and flags."
Stopping to shop for some last-minute cheese on the way to her sister's home for dinner, Trudy Steinberg of Yonkers said the family's celebration would be "more upbeat, more glad, more hopeful." But her husband, Leon, interrupted her in disagreement. "No it won't -- I'm pessimistic," he said. "You're dealing with people who are murderers over there. As soon as it's over, they want Jerusalem."
People cannot help but be of two minds, said Morris A. Schmidman, an Orthodox rabbi who is director of the Council of Jewish Organizations in Brooklyn. "You have hope that it will be successful at the same time as a realization that the sordid past puts a dimmer on the prospects," he said.

HEADLINE: Environment Groups Are Split on Support For Free-Trade Pact

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
A dispute over the trade pact with Mexico and Canada has split the American environmental movement, exposing a profound ideological rift over whether some large national environmental organizations have become too friendly with the Clinton White House.
The rift, which has been simmering since early this year, boiled over into a public feud today after a group of environmental leaders appeared with Vice President Al Gore to voice their support for the North American Free Trade Agreement now being considered by Congress. 
 The feud generally pits big national environmental groups based in New York and Washington -- which have shown a willingness to compromise to increase their influence at the highest levels of the Government -- against other organizations, some of which are just as large, that are focused on grass-roots efforts.
The grass-roots groups look askance at compromise, insisting that the trade agreement would weaken environmental and health standards in the United States. The groups supporting the trade agreement have gained prominence in Washington since the election, in part because some of their former staff members are now members of the Clinton Administration.
The fight that boiled over today concerns both the trade agreement and political tactics. But the differences also mirror other battles in the environmental community over public lands policy, wetlands, endangered species and managing toxic compounds. Many of those differences have been quietly brewing since the first months of the Clinton Presidency.
This morning the leaders of six prominent national environmental groups promised to help the White House fight for Congressional passage of the trade pact. Groups opposing it immediately responded in terms environmentalists normally use for polluters. Each side accused the other of distorting facts, failing to recognize economic or political reality and imperiling public safety.
The endorsements came during a news conference on Capitol Hill at which Mr. Gore was flanked by the heads of the National Audubon Society, the National Wildlife Federation, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Environmental Defense Fund, the World Wildlife Fund and Conservation International.
Jay D. Hair, the head of the National Wildlife Federation, the nation's largest conservation group, accused environmentalists that oppose the trade agreement of "putting their protectionist polemics ahead of concern for the environment." He added that the groups attacking the proposal "haven't seen the documents," "don't have the facts," and "are feeding off misinformation."
 
'Between a Rock and a Sponge'
 The environmental organizations opposing the trade agreement include the Sierra Club, the Humane Society of the United States, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and nearly 300 state, regional and community groups. Leaders of these groups, arguing that the agreement would weaken environmental laws in the United States, have begun a campaign to prevent its passage.
The groups opposing the agreement have formed a new coalition, the Citizens Trade Campaign, which is preparing a newspaper advertisement for publication next week asserting that the National Wildlife Federation and the five other groups have become too close to big business. A draft of the text of the advertisement, which circulated today in Washington, asks, "Why are some 'green' groups so quick to sell off the North American environment? Maybe they are too cozy with their corporate funders."
Tim Hermach, the executive director of the Native Forest Council, an environmental group in Eugene, Ore. that opposes the trade agreement, said: "Environmentalists who are in support of this agreement are a sponge. They don't know what they want. They are not sure how to get it, and they can be squeezed any time. Industry is absolutely clear about what it wants, and they are absolutely ruthless in doing anything to get it. So Bill Clinton is between a rock and a sponge and which one would you pick to have as an enemy?"
 
Critics See No Compromise
 The trade agreement would gradually eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers between the United States, Mexico and Canada, much of it by the end of the decade. On Tuesday, President Clinton signed a supplemental agreement negotiated by Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, and Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, that is designed to prevent each country from lowering environmental standards to gain a competitive advantage.
The environmental provisions also call for the United States, Canada and Mexico to establish a commission to oversee each country's enforcement of its own laws. And the White House has agreed to establish a $4 billion fund for environmental cleanup along the border with Mexico.
The plan's critics in the environmental movement said the provisions were too vaguely worded to have real impact if a dispute over environmental issues arose between two countries. They also argued that the public is not allowed to participate fully in resolving disputes between nations and that the overall effect of the agreement would be to lower standards to accommodate the Mexican economy.
"It's perplexing to me how any environmental group could support this agreement," said Lori M. Wallach, director of the trade program for Public Citizen in Washington.
John H. Adams, the executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he had anticipated such criticism from colleagues in his movement. "I recognize that this is a complex and difficult issue on which reasonable people with the same values and objectives can differ," he said.
 
Supporters Helped Devise Plan
 Mr. Adams said that members of his staff had spent thousands of hours participating with Administration officials in the development of the environmental provisions of the agreement and that they had provided a "solid institutional framework" that would protect Mexico without weakening American environmental and health statutes.
Kathryn Fuller, the president of the World Wildlife Fund, noted that Mexico has more biological resources than almost any other country and that by acquiring greater economic opportunities through the trade agreement, Mexico would also have more money available to protect valuable species of plants and animals.
Peter Berle, the president of the National Audubon Society, Fred Krupp, the executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, and Dr. Russell Mittermeier, the president of Conservation International, also said they had no doubt that approving the trade agreement was better for the environment.
Legal and scientific experts who have reviewed the text of the environmental agreements or followed the debate in the environmental community, said today they agreed with environmental leaders who support the pact.
"The trade agreement provides a context for dealing with the environment in Mexico and a way to cooperate to take better care of our environment," said Dr. Peter H. Raven, a botanist and director of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis. "Mexico has to have the resources to deal with these problems. You can't deal with these issues if you're poor."

HEADLINE: Hailing Health Plan but Denouncing Trade Pact, Big Labor Is Heard Again

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
After years of falling membership and political influence, organized labor has emerged as a force behind both the drive to stop President Clinton's proposed trade agreement with Mexico and Canada and the campaign to enact his overhaul of the health care system.
One reason for the new clout of the unions, which have long been irrelevant to the debates over such national issues, is a serendipitous convergence of their agenda with the agendas of many other interest groups, in particular advocates for the poor and the environment. Another is a friend in the White House who, despite the differences over trade, has been granting labor easier access and more of its wishes than any President since Lyndon B. Johnson. 
 Despite likely quibbles, unions can be expected to support the health plan. "The President has pointed the nation in the right direction," Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said a few days ago. But labor vehemently opposes the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Kirkland called "a poison pill left over from the previous Administration."
For weeks, the conventional wisdom has had it that the agreement would lose if the House of Representatives were to vote on it now. The Senate appears to support the agreement, but at present most Democrats in the House of Representatives, with an eye on next year's congressional elections, appear opposed. One prominent union leader, William H. Bywater, president of the electrical workers union, is promising to fight the reelection of congressmen who support the agreement.
 
Hitting Labor's 'Hot Button'
 Freshman Democrats in the House said they voted in secret on Monday to oppose the agreement. Two House leaders who are from union strongholds in Michigan -- David E. Bonior, the majority whip and third-ranking leader, and William D. Ford, chairman of the education and labor committee -- are unequivocally opposed. And Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader and the recipient of strong union support, has been sharply critical of the agreement.
"Nafta hits the hot button," said Gerald W. McEntee, president of the 1.3-million-member American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees. "Health care is important. Reducing the deficit is important. But No. 1 is still jobs, and Nafta has a direct relationship to jobs. People understand that. They see a real possibility their companies will go south."
Thomas J. Downey, a political consultant here and former Democratic House member from Long Island, said: "With all due respect to my friends in labor, I'm for Nafta. But they are effective and persistent. They have much of the soul of the Democratic Party. They are going to play a very big role in the President's agenda."
It is too soon to gauge whether unions can win this one. It was not until Tuesday that President Clinton began to fight, mustering former Presidents Bush, Carter and Ford to a White House ceremony and dispatching cabinet officers to help promote the agreement. But on no other issue in recent years has organized labor committed such energy, and on no other has it found such wide support.
 
Union Membership Dropping
 As an institution, organized labor has not changed as much as the climate around it. Most unions, gathered under the umbrella of A.F.L.-C.I.O., are led by white males, most older than 60. While stalwart defenders of democracy, only a few unions, like the teamsters and the mine workers, elect their leaders directly. In most other unions, leaders are elected indirectly by delegates to conventions, often by acclamation. And unlike most of their members today, most leaders have secure jobs. Once in office, many die there.
Organized labor's membership, strongest in shrinking manufacturing industries and weakest in growing services industries, is still receding. Officials close to the federation say that at its biannual convention next month in San Francisco it is likely to report that membership of the affiliated unions has dropped by close to one million, to 13.9 million, in just two years. Union members today make up less than 16 percent of the work force.
And labor may still lack sufficient influence, even with Democrats in control of the White House and Congress, to achieve their more parochial goals, like rewriting labor laws they believe are stacked against them or stopping companies from firing striking workers.
But organized labor can marshal one of the nation's mightiest political networks, as well as fat campaign coffers, in pursuit of its causes. The Federal Election Commission reports that of the 10 largest contributions by political action committees to candidates for Federal office in 1991 and 1992, five were from unions. And labor can rally hundreds of thousands of men and women to lobby legislators, get out the vote and march in demonstrations.
 
'Things Are Bad Enough'
 The deployment of such resources has had little effect on the course of public policy in recent years. But the trade agreement has aroused many other interests that have joined labor in a new lobby called the Citizens Trade Campaign.
The campaign's participants include Friends of the Earth and Environmental Action, which fear a surge in air and water pollution from American companies moving south of the border, the National Consumers League, the National Council of Senior Citizens and the National Farmers Union.
In the past, said Mark Anderson, director of trade affairs at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the Government's trade-opening treaties were worked out in the back rooms of Congress and the Administration. "This fight will take place in the cities and towns across the country," he said.
Union workers, and many nonunion workers, see the trade agreement aggravating an already volatile job market in which major companies like General Motors Corporation and I.B.M. lay off workers by the tens of thousands, companies relocate factories to low-wage countries and employers replace full-time jobs with part-time and temporary jobs.
"Things are bad enough,"said Ben Fischer, a professor of public service at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a former steelworkers union officer. "There's so much insecurity. Why add to it?"
 
Support for Health Overhaul
 Unions are fairly content with the other big proposal on the President's fall agenda, the health plan. Some wanted a single-payer system that would be entirely taxpayer financed and Government managed, like Canada's, not the mixed, public-private arrangement the President is proposing.
Some also expect to find grounds for dispute once they know more details. But they say it still meets their long-sought, once politically quixotic goal of guaranteed health care for all.
"It's a major step in the right direction," said Ronald Carey, president of the 1.4-million member teamsters union. "It's not single-payer, but it's okay if it is for all Americans and does not have working people paying all the freight."
By contrast, labor considers the trade agreement rotten to the core. The agreement would phase out many obstacles to investment and trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico. Canada, with an economy much like that of the United States, has not been an issue. But unions say the agreement's implications for commerce with Mexico are alarming.
Low wages are an obvious lure for those American companies whose labor costs represent a major part of the prices they charge. Average wages and fringe benefits in Mexico are about one-seventh those in the United States. Unions say the difference can give Mexican companies a big edge in competing with American producers, thus jeopardizing American jobs.
In defense of the agreement, President Clinton echoes most economists in arguing that history shows that everyone gains in wages, jobs and economic growth when trade obstacles like tariffs and quotas are removed.
Indeed, American exports to Mexico have grown since the relaxation of some trade barriers in the 1980's. Such growth benefits workers who produce export items, though it does not help workers who lose jobs to imports from Mexico. Mr. Clinton also argues that as the Mexican economy improves, illegal immigration, which many workers see as a threat to their jobs, will abate.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, who supports most of labor's agenda, including raising the minimum wage and a law against dismissing striking workers, confronted the unions on trade in a speech last week. He accused labor of indulging in Luddite-like "politics of preservation grounded in fear."
But unions look not to the wide effects of a change in economic policy but to the businesses that have abandoned factories in the United States, impoverishing some communities and leaving workers either jobs that are much worse in terms of pay and benefits or no jobs at all.
 
Questioning Pact's Fairness
 The agreement, says Mr. Anderson of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., would lead to more letters like one the Smead Manufacturing Company in Hastings, Minn., makers of file folders and other office products, sent its 2,600 workers on Aug. 4.
"In my July 1, 1993 notice, I stated that we were in the process of making a decision regarding assembling selected products in Mexico, Smead's president, Ebba C. Hoffman, wrote." After a careful review, she said, "the decision has been made to start assembling selected five-piece pockets and expanding files in Mexico."
And the production of several other products would also be moved to Mexico in coming months, she said, adding: "We simply cannot continue losing sales of these key products."
Unions say they are all for more trade, but they insist on an agreement with Mexico that would raise minimum wages there, give Mexican workers the right to form unions and require tough workplace health and safety standards.
Donald Ross, an assistant secretary of labor, acknowledges the unions' fears but says there is little the Government can do to tame the economy's tides. "Because of the way the economy has changed," he said, "the reality of job security that our parents had is largely a thing of the past. It's not honest to say we can fix it."
 
Emphasis on Job Training
 He and Mr. Reich have promised to do more to help workers adjust. They are preparing a sweeping overhaul of the Government's job training programs and its assistance to unemployed workers. Mr. Reich also envisions training workers for a high-skill, high-wage workplace of the future. But unions are skeptical.
"Retrain people for what?" Mr. Carey asked. "Workers want to know, Will I be able to get married, or purchase a house?"
Professor Fischer said: "Unions are not philosophical societies. They are oriented toward the immediate needs of their members. They represent the people who pay their dues. They have no other constituency.
"They have no choice but to look at Nafta and say, 'Can this represent any gain for my members?' They would have to make a devious, remote case to show that it would."

HEADLINE: MIDEAST ACCORD;
Iranian Leader Denounces Peace Pact

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Sept. 15

 BODY:
The Iranian President, Hashemi Rafsanjani, has denounced the accords between the P.L.O. and Israel as "the most degrading times for the Islamic holy war in Palestine" and predicted that they will fail to yield peace.
"The Palestinian problem cannot be solved by several people signing an agreement in the White House," Mr. Rafsanjani said on Tuesday of the formal ceremony in Washington on Monday. 
 Widely viewed as the Iranian leader most inclined toward pragmatic economic and foreign policy, the President has effectively added his voice to that of the ideological rank and file of the Iranian clergy and Government-owned news organizations opposed to the peace pact.
Lower-ranking Iranian figures have villified the accord over the last few days as "a stain of shame" for Arabs and Muslims across the world and condemned the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman, Yasir Arafat, as a "traitor" for reaching agreements with Israel on mutual recognition and on limited self-rule for Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho.
 
Dismissed as Mere Paper
 Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the influential Chief Justice of Iran, had opened the Iranian clergy's offensive against the accords a few days ago by rejecting them as nothing more than pieces of paper signed by a few men.
Still, experts on Iranian affairs found it significant that Mr. Rafsanjani did not speak out until nearly two weeks after news of the draft peace agreement first leaked out and until after it was signed on Monday..
They interpreted the delay as a sign of Teheran's sensitivity to widespread support for the accord among among Palestinians and Arab governments, including gulf states that Iran has been courting since the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
Mr. Rafsanjani's delay also reflects Iran's severe economic problems, which limit its willigness or ability challenge an accord that has international support and the United States as a guardian.
Baqer Moin, an expert on Iranian affairs and a commentator on Persian Gulf affairs in London, said that Iran's policy reflected the competing priorities Teheran now faces in dealing with the Arab world. "On one hand Iran wants to lead the Islamic fundamentalist movements, which oppose virtually every Arab regime as well as the peace process, while, in the same time, trying to improve its relations with gulf Arabs and Egypt," he said
The Arab gulf countries whose good will Iran is courting, particularly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, unambigiously support the agreement on limited Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, a factor that may restrain the Iranian Government from openly encouraging pro-Iranian groups to sink the accord.
Although Iran has a proxy army in Lebanon -- the pro-Iranian Party of God militia -- there is little it can do there directly to sabotage the accord. Troops from Syria, Iran's only strategic Arab ally, still control much of Lebanon.
So far Syria has refrained from opposing the P.L.O.'s peace efforts until it is clear what effect they will have on a potential Syrian-Israeli settlement over the Golan Heights.
 
A Shrinking Tolerance
 In any case, there is shrinking tolerance among the Lebanese for foreign powers playing havoc with their country, an attitude that raises questions about the future sway of the Party of God there.
Iraq, which would have been widely expected to denounce the accord, has also been doling out its condemnations in measured doses, keeping some room for maneuver. Neither President Saddam Hussein nor any of his senior aides have loudly and clearly clearly denounced the pact, leaving statements of disapproval to the Government-owned news organizations.
The Iraqi-based opposition to the Iranian Government known as the Mujahedeen Khalq has proclaimed its support of the agreement, suggesting that it did so with a nod from its Iraqi hosts.
"The Iranians are equally anxious and angry about this agreement," said Qassem Jaafar, a Middle East strategic and military affairs expert who writes for Al Hayat, a London-based daily.
"It is a deal that raises anxiety in places like Damascus and Baghdad as well, the more so since it appears that Palestinians by and large are rallying behind Arafat so far," Mr. Jaafar said in a telephone interview.
 
Something Iran Can't Ignore
 For economic reasons alone, Iran cannot afford to ignore a budding Arab-Western alliance to make the Israeli-Palestinian agreements work. With oil prices having fallen steeply over the past six months and its foreign debt exceeding $20 billion, Iran is highly in a vulnerable spot. The United States has been tightening existing bans on the export of Western technology, weapons and chemicals to Iran and forbids its oil companies from importing Iranian oil.
The sharp decline in oil prices and the growth in debt have led most foreign oil and industrial companies to freeze credit to Iran. The Iranian central bank is trying to contain spending of precious hard currency and has stopped guaranteeing letters of credit for Iranian importers, strangling domestic industries that depend on imported spare parts and raw materials.
Oil prices have tumbled by roughly $4 a barrel over the last six months, and experts say that each dollar drop represents a loss of a billion dollars in annual income a year for Iran.

HEADLINE: Fearful of Tourism Decline, Florida Offers Assurances on Safety

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TALLAHASSEE, Fla., Sept. 15

 BODY:
As law-enforcement authorities here stepped up their search for the killers of a British tourist, Florida tourism officials today issued new pledges intended to make the state's streets and highways safer and to limit damage to the state's vital tourism industry.
Galvanized by the blizzard of negative publicity around the world that followed the shooting death of 34-year-old Gary Colley early Tuesday at a highway rest stop east of here, the authorities in Jefferson County, where Mr. Colley was killed, began a dragnet aimed at young blacks with criminal records, a move that immediately generated controversy. 
 At the same time, the state's top law-enforcement officer and its tourism chief appeared at a news conference this morning to plead with residents and tourists alike to remain calm and wait for the new security measures to take effect.
"Florida does care, we are concerned, and we are addressing the problem," said Greg Farmer, Secretary of the Department of Commerce, which oversees the state's $31 billion-a-year tourist industry.
"Statistically, this is a very safe place to visit," he added.
 
'Now There Is a Problem'
 Mr. Colley's death, which the police said occurred when he tried to flee robbers, was the second of a foreign tourist in Florida in less than a week and the ninth since last October. James T. Moore, director of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, said that the car used in Tuesday's attack had been found and that "some useful information" had been recovered from it. He declined to give details.
Mr. Moore also defended the security measures in place on Florida highways before Mr. Colley was shot. "How many places can we guard?" he asked. "We had no reason to think we should deploy scarce resources at rest areas, because there was not a problem there. Now there is a problem."
He also suggested that the robberies and killings of foreign tourists were part of a broader social malaise not limited to Florida and one that law-enforcement officials could not be expected to control, much less solve. "We've got to do a better job helping people respect the value of a human life, and not wait until they are 17 years of age to realize that," he said.
In Jefferson County, sheriff's deputies began rounding up every black male ages 15 to 22 with a criminal record involving firearms or stolen cars. Sheriff Ken Fortune said that as many as 60 potential suspects would be photographed and fingerprinted as part of the investigation into Mr. Colley's death. According to the 1990 census, 43 percent of the county's 11,296 residents are black.
"We have not focused on any one person," Sheriff Fortune said. But, he added, "we've got some mothers very upset because we're picking up their children."
Since Mr. Colley was slain, the state government has offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of his killers, has set up a toll-free number to provide safety and other tourism tips and has begun providing security at all 76 rest areas on its Interstate highways. Those efforts, supplementing an existing campaign to provide safety brochures to foreign visitors, won praise today from European tourism industry executives.
"I actually think the Florida tourism authorities have taken a good and positive approach to this problem," Keith Betton, a spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents, said in a telephone interview. "I can think of many countries that would be tempted to play this down and pretend it is not happening. But Florida's whole attitude has been very professional."
Foreigners account for about 7 million of the 42 million people who visit Florida each year, and until the two recent killings, tourism over all had been on the way to a record year. Now, however, Mr. Farmer, the Commerce Secretary, said he expected the pace to drop by 12 percent to 15 percent. But travel industry executives around the state today offered varied assessments of the probable impact of the violence.
In Orlando, the state's most popular tourist destination, officials at attractions like Disney World and Universal Studios said their business was at normal levels. Illustrating the importance of tourism to the Florida economy, Gov. Lawton Chiles flew to Orlando today to join Universal executives in announcing plans to build a second theme park, several hotels, and new movie and television production sites there.
"Some of our international business has been decreasing," said Randy Garfield, vice president for marketing at Universal Studios Florida, "but it's still considerably up from last year." Mr. Garfield said the recent slippage could be traced not only to crime but also to higher airfares and sluggish economies in Europe.
 
Reaction Among Europeans
 Bryn Roden, president of American Connections, a Miami Beach tour agency whose clients are exclusively European, said the full impact of the killings will not be felt for weeks. Mr. Roden said he expected a decline of 25 percent to 30 percent in his bookings, since the killings occurred precisely when British and German tour operators were printing brochures for the 1994 season and tourists from those countries were planning next summer's holidays.
"Europeans can go on vacation and be robbed or mugged anywhere," said Mr. Roden, a Briton. "The big difference is that when they come here they can also end up looking down the barrel of a gun. That simply does not happen in European vacation resorts. Europeans are not used to guns, and they are frightened. It's as simple as that."
Those comments were echoed today by a group of British tourists eagerly waiting at Miami International Airport for the plane that would take them home. Ed and Karen Bolton of London said they had felt safe only in their hotel and that they were afraid even to rent a car in Florida after the first of the killings, in Miami, last week.
"I would never ever come here again, unless it was for business," said Mr. Bolton, who has been a frequent visitor in the past, "and then I would leave as soon as possible. The United States needs gun laws. I think your Government needs a swift kick in the butt. It's a shame, because this is such a lovely country."
While bookings from Europe are falling, tourism authorities said there had been no discernable decline in domestic bookings, which still account for more than 80 percent of Florida's tourist business. Mr. Farmer said that was in part because Americans tended to perceive their own country as "a violent, gun-ridden society" and to regard crime as just another feature of the landscape.
When a tourist is killed, he said, "it's not as much a shocker" to Americans as to foreigners. Domestic visitors understand, he added, that the recent attacks are "isolated incidents" that could have occurred almost anywhere.
Nevertheless, there were signs all over the state that the tourist killings are forcing Florida's 13 million residents to take a closer look at crime and how to control it. Some legislators have called for a ban of possession of handguns by minors; others, concerned that many "smash-and-grab" robberies are committed by criminals who had been released early from prisons because of overcrowding, said they would press for more money to build jails and prisons.
State officials emphasized today that less than a 10th of a percent of the tourists who visited Florida last year became victims of crime. But Florida's index of violent crime, 1,184 per 100,000 people in 1991, is the highest in the nation, according to statistics from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and some here are demanding tougher treatment of the criminals who prey on the elderly and tourists.
"'We should shoot them down like the dogs they are," Secretary of State Jim Smith told The Tallahassee Democrat. Mr. Smith, who is seeking the Republican nomination for governor in 1994, also said the state had "find a way to declare war on people out there."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE PRIMARY: Westchester;
Democrats Vow United Front In Effort to Unseat O'Rourke

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS, Sept. 15

 BODY:
With occasional flashes of discomfort, the victor and the vanquished in the Westchester County Democratic primary came together today to declare a united front against County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, whom they hope to unseat in November.
Richard L. Brodsky, the 47-year-old Assemblyman from Greenburgh who squeezed out a 920-vote victory in a contest in which 32,000 votes were cast, and his defeated opponent, Andrew J. Spano, the County Clerk, embraced each other at what was billed as a Democratic unity rally. It was held on the steps of the County Office Building, where Mr. O'Rourke has had his offices for the last 11 years. 
 For the first time in generations, the Democrats believe they have a solid chance to capture the top two county offices, the executive's job and the post of District Attorney. Michael G. Cherkasky, 43, career prosecutor in Manhattan, won in a landslide over his opponent, Paul W. Pickelle, a Scarsdale criminal lawyer, in the district attorney's race; he will face Jeanine Pirro, a former county judge, in the Nov. 2 election.
In this century, only one Democrat, Alfred B. DelBello, the County Executive from 1973 through 1982, has held either of the two top jobs, and it was a canny piece of political stagecraft that he was chosen to serve as the rally master of ceremonies today.
 
From Scorn to Praise
 At the rally Mr. Brodsky praised Mr. Spano, whom he had belittled as "Clerk Spano," as "an extraordinary spirit" who has shown "grace under pressure." And Mr. Spano called Mr. Brodsky, whom he had scorned as arrogant, "one of the brightest, most creative people I know."
The two had agreed to work together for a Democratic victory at one of the breakfast sessions at which party leaders like Dennis Mehiel served as peace makers. But Mr. Spano could not keep his resentment from the campaign entirely in check. "By coming together, we're going to benefit Richard, who can use a little adjustment once in a while," he said. Still, Mr. Brodsky was willing to kiss Mr. Spano on the cheek for the cameras.
 
Plans for Attack
 In his remarks to a small sidewalk crowd, Mr. Brodsky suggested that he would attack Mr. O'Rourke for the county's floundering economy and for what he described as Mr. O'Rourke's conflicts of interest in allowing three people close to him -- his daughter, his companion and her son -- to obtain jobs with county contractors. An investigation by District Attorney Carl A. Vergari, who is retiring after 25 years in the job, found Mr. O'Rourke had broken no laws.
"I promise you honest government, a government that will put people back to work," Mr. Brodksy declared.
Mr. O'Rourke, at a news conference nominally about a $4 million program to improve the county's training school for firefighters, shot back at Mr. Brodsky, asserting that Mr. Brodsky would not be able to withstand the scrutiny that Mr. O'Rourke has received as the county's highest official. He also termed Mr. Brodsky a "coward," accusing him of dodging controversial votes in the State Assembly.
"It will not be a campaign that Westchester has seen before and that's too bad, but that's the way these things go," he said.
He argued that his personal ethics should no longer be a campaign issue since an erroneous "perception" had been cleared up by Mr. Vergari.
Mr. Brodsky's narrow victory was helped by a compelling town supervisor's contest in Greenburgh that drew more Democrats, 6,500, than almost anywhere else in the county. By a 3-to-1 margin, they voted for their fellow resident, Mr. Brodsky, for county executive. Paul J. Feiner, the incumbent, won the nomination for Greenburgh town supervisor.
In the much larger city of Yonkers, where Mr. Spano enjoys strong support, the primary drew only 7,800 voters.
This will be Mr. Brodsky's second try for the county executive's job. Four years ago, he lost to Mr. O'Rourke by a margin of 52 percent of the vote to 45 percent. But this time Democrats have achieved a considerable edge in registration in this historically Republican county, 178,753 to 152,729, and Mr. O'Rourke is considered more vulnerable.
Mr. Brodsky, whose father was a structural-steel engineer and whose mother was active in politics, was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn. His family moved to Ardsley in Westchester when he was 11. He attended Brandeis University and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1971.
He worked for several years for a foundation set up by the widow of Robert F. Kennedy and then as legislative counsel to Mr. DelBello. In 1975, he made his first bid for political office, winning election to the county's Board of Legislators. He served as a county legislator for four terms and first ran for the Assembly in 1982.
He is married to the former Paige Massman, a onetime Broadway actress who with her family owns a beef-cattle ranch in Montana. The Brodskys spend vacations there and come hom with beef for a large barbecue at their 300-year-old Greenburgh house for friends and associates. They have two daughters, Emily, 7 and Julianne Willie, 2.

HEADLINE: Eye on Olympics, China Pursues Air Safety

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Worried that its effort to become the host to the 2000 Olympic Games could be undermined by safety concerns among foreigners who fly on China's airlines, Chinese aviation authorities have announced a major crackdown on safety violations.
For anyone who has flown in China, the new safety drive is much overdue. China's economic takeoff has produced a boom in air travel -- and accidents -- with the increase in new domestic airlines last year allowed by the breakup of the state air monopoly in 1988. 
 At Beijing International Airport, British Airways has banned the boarding of passengers during refueling operations because the local ground crews refuse to put out their cigarettes.
"Can you imagine the fumes from 100 tons of fuel in the air and a guy is sitting there with a butt in his mouth?" a manager of an international airline said. "I tell off about four people a week, but it doesn't do any good."
On many flights, seat belts are optional, flight crews and cabin staff invisible and, in one noted accident in Hong Kong harbor in 1988, life jackets nonexistent. Chinese travelers seldom check bags because they will get lost, so the aisles of China's airliners are often so clogged with luggage, not to mention standing passengers, as to make a speedy exit impossible.
At a recent news conference, Yan Zhixiang, deputy director general of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told reporters, "The aviation sector, which is undergoing rapid expansion, has failed to carry through rules on air safety and security."
Lax safety and security standards prompted one passenger association in the United States to quip in its newsletter that flying in China was more dangerous than strolling through the streets of Sarajevo.
An exaggeration, to be sure, but the barbs from abroad have been reinforced by so many scare stories from China's frequent fliers that the leadership was forced to crack down before the country's air safety record was thrown onto the list of reasons China's critics have been compiling to keep the 2000 Games away from here, airline industry officials say.
International aviation officials are loath to say China's air fatality record is worse than that of other developing countries, in part because China still does not report its safety data to industry organizations. But China's aviation authorities themselves said last week that the total of 331 deaths in commercial airliner crashes in the last 13 months was intolerable and constituted a warning that safety systems had gone awry.
Among the worst aspects of the system is air-traffic control, where old radars and inadequate communication systems at times keep controllers in the dark about what is going on.
Flight delays are also epidemic these days. The aviation authority's most recent figures show that delays in scheduled flights jumped from 8 percent in May and June last year to 18 percent this year and that most of those delays were due to air-traffic control problems.
Airline officials say air-traffic controllers often have little choice but to delay flights because the bulk of China's airspace is reserved for the military. When narrow civilian flight corridors fill up with traffic, controllers cannot assign flights to parallel military corridors without getting permission from the military, another time-consuming procedure.
Steps China has taken to improve its performance include signing contracts with international aviation companies to help Chinese airlines set up new maintenance and training programs.
Boeing is running a large pilot-training program as part of its contracts to sell billions of dollars in new aircraft here. British Airways has just signed a 12-month contract with China Southern Airline to help develop its maintenance program.
But in the largest aviation improvement program for the Olympics the Chinese authorities hope to entice foreign airlines and investors to build or modernize 100 airports nationwide by the year 2000 to meet an estimated demand of 180 million annual passengers, a tripling of the estimated 60 million yearly passengers now.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Promises Help on Medical Care

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans and the American Medical Association vowed today to cooperate with President Clinton in revamping the nation's health care system, but they said Mr. Clinton's proposals relied far too much on Government regulation to control costs.
Excitement and anxiety about Mr. Clinton's plan, to be unveiled on Sept. 22, produced a dozen news conferences around town today. Even critics of the Clinton plan said they assumed that Congress would, by the end of next year, pass a bill to guarantee medical care for all Americans. 
Lobbyists for the alcohol and tobacco industries skirmished today over one of the major unresolved elements of Mr. Clinton's plan: taxes.
Members of Congress from tobacco-producing states pleaded with White House officials to propose an increase in the Federal excise tax on alcoholic beverages, so cigarettes would not bear the full burden of new taxes.
President Clinton wants to raise $105 billion over seven years from what he calls new "sin taxes." He has said that he would propose higher cigarette taxes but that he has not decided on the amount of the increase. He is said to be seriously considering a higher tax on alcohol but expects widespread opposition in Congress and thus has not decided whether to propose it.
 
Defense of Alcohol
 Fred A. Meister, president of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade association for liquor manufacturers, said: "The tobacco industry realizes that the Administration wants to increase its taxes very substantially. Tobacco lobbyists are using every political argument they can to pass the tax off onto beverage alcohol generally and liquor in particular."
"There is no reason alcohol should be asked to carry the tax burden for cigarettes," Mr. Meister said, asserting that "alcohol may have some cardiovascular health benefits."
Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, and other Republicans praised the President and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for serious efforts to guarantee coverage for all Americans, including the 37 million who have no health insurance. But Mr. Dole said Republicans had their own plan.
"Our proposal is dramatically different from the Administration's," Mr. Dole said. "We do not mandate employers to pay for health care. We do not create mandatory health alliances that are monopolies. We do not create global budgets through the use of premium caps. Nor do we create a variety of new costly benefits and entitlement programs."
 
G.O.P. Cites Flexibility
 The Republicans, like Mr. Clinton, would establish health insurance purchasing groups in every state, to buy coverage for millions of consumers and thousands of small businesses. The Republicans said that participation in these groups would be voluntary under their plan but compulsory for most Americans under the Clinton plan. The Republican proposal would require all Americans to obtain health insurance but allow people to buy individual policies.
Senator John H. Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, said the Republican proposal would allow several purchasing groups to operate in the same geographical area, whereas the Clinton plan would allow only one.
Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the A.M.A., said he was distressed at the "degree of proposed Government intrusion into the relationship between physician and patient" under the Clinton plan. "The health of our patients and their families may suffer as economics becomes more important than quality," he said.
Under the Clinton plan, Dr. Todd said, "our biggest concern is that we will have a health care system run by the insurance industry" and by a powerful new Federal agency, the National Health Board. The doctors support a Federal mandate requiring employers to buy insurance for their employees, but they oppose Mr. Clinton's proposal for Federal regulation of health insurance premiums.
For years, the nation's doctors and hospitals have been seeking relief from Federal antitrust laws. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission issued new guidelines today to ease fears of the health care industry that cost-cutting mergers and joint ventures might violate such laws.
The Government said, for example, that it would generally not challenge hospital mergers in which one hospital is more than five years old and has fewer than 100 beds and fewer than 40 patients a day.
 
'We Are Disappointed'
 Administration officials said the guidelines were simply clarifications of existing policy and did not provide the broad exemptions from antitrust law sought by doctors and the hospital industry.
Kirk B. Johnson, general counsel of the American Medical Association, said: "We are disappointed. The guidelines really don't give us any additional flexibility. They authorize conduct that we always believed was safe."
Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, said: "We're going to solve a problem in the antitrust field without changing one word, one comma or one semicolon of the antitrust laws, and there is no need to. Our antitrust laws are not to blame for the high cost of health care."
Mrs. Clinton's Task Force on National Health Care Reform considered major changes in antitrust law that would have exempted doctors and hospitals. But the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission strenuously opposed such changes, saying they would weaken competition in the health care industry, harm consumers and undermine the Government's enforcement power.
In a report delivered today to Mrs. Clinton, a consumer group estimated that two million Americans lose health insurance coverage each month.
Ronald F. Pollack, executive director of the consumer group, Families USA, said that most of those people regain insurance in five to nine months. But their experience "shows why there is so much insecurity about the nation's health care system," Mr. Pollack said.

HEADLINE: 2 Small Banks Cut Prime to 5 3/4%; Others Stay at 6%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Southwest Bank of St. Louis and the Central Fidelity Bank of Richmond cut their prime rates yesterday to 5 3/4 percent from 6 percent, but the moves were not followed by larger banks.
Executives of some big New York banks indicated that they had no immediate plans to cut their prime rates. 
 Short-term interest rates have been steady since July of last year, when the prime rate was cut to 6 percent from 6 1/2 percent. Bankers and others have been wondering whether the next cut in the prime could come without waiting for the Federal Reserve to reduce short-term rates.
Because the prime rate is unusually high relative to other short-term rates, and the banking industry has been earning record profits over the last 18 months, some analysts say banks could afford to lower their prime rates.
 
A Benchmark Rate
 The prime rate is a widely used benchmark for setting interest rates on consumer loans, particularly credit cards and home equity loans. Most loans to businesses fluctuate according to short-term interest rates controlled by the Federal Reserve, not banks, but loans to small and medium-sized businesses are frequently based on the prime.
Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at Tucker Anthony, the securities firm, said the combination of 1994 elections and a weak economy was likely to lead to an outcry from Washington that "to help kick-start the economy the banks should cut the prime rate to 5 percent."
Other analysts said that the Clinton Administration had not yet done any favors for the banking industry that would encourage banks to cooperate. "Obviously, at some point the banks could catch some heat from the Clinton Administration, but it's too soon for that now," said Thomas Hanley, a banking analyst at CS First Boston. He does not expect large banks to lower their prime rates until early next year.
Lewis N. Miller Jr., president of the Central Fidelity Bank, said he had cut the prime rate because of the unusually wide spread between the interest rates banks pay on deposits and other borrowed money and the rates they have been collecting on loans. The lower rate was a message to local businesses, he said, that the bank is eager to lend.
Bankers in New York, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, said they had discussed the possibility of a lower prime rate in recent days. But they have not lowered the rate because there has been no signal from the Fed that it wants to reduce short-term interest rates.
 
Rates Could Go Up
 In fact, one banker said short-term rates could move up, not down, and added that the Federal Reserve's chairman, Alan Greenspan, warned two months ago about the possibility of higher interest rates.
Still, banks have cut some other interest rates over the last year. In the credit card business, where competition for customers has grown sharper, the average rate on cards issued by large banks has fallen to 17.22 percent from 18.07 percent a year ago, said Robert McKinley, president of RAM Research, a Frederick, Md., company that compiles lists of credit card interest rates.
Although weak demand is usually a reason to lower prices for most businesses, bankers do not expect that demand for business loans would be increased much by a slightly lower interest rate. Some pointed to the experience of the Chemical Bank, the nation's third-largest bank, which cut its prime rate in April 1992 to 6 1/4 percent while other banks stayed at 6 1/2 percent. After three months, Chemical returned to 6 1/2 percent and said the lower rate had not attracted much new business.
"The level of interest rates does not matter as much to businesses as the reason for the borrowing," said Irwin Kellner, senior vice president at Chemical Bank.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rally Erases Bonds' Early Losses

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Where do we go from here? That was the question of the day in the bond market yesterday morning.
Following a sharp selloff on Tuesday that was sparked by an higher-than-expected inflation report, prices slumped sharply for the second day and yields jumped as trading opened in New York. 
 But a furious afternoon surge, which wiped out most of the losses on the day, turned out to be a pretty strong reply: Don't declare the rally over yet.
The price of the 30-year bond, which was down as much as 112/32 points in early trading, finished down just 1/32 . And the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, ended the day unchanged at 5.97 percent, after jumping as high as 6.07 percent.
The recovery was even stronger among Treasury notes. The price of the 10-year note was up 8/32 on the day as the yield fell to 5.36 percent, from 5.39 percent. During the day, the price of the note had been down 23/32 , with the yield up to 5.48 percent.
 
Two-Year Note Up
 Short-term notes also performed well, as some investors bought them because they would be less volatile and risky if long-term interest rates did begin to climb. The price of the two-year note was up 3/32 as the yield dropped to 3.84 percent, from 3.89 percent.
What became clear yesterday was that several of the forces that helped drive the recent rally were still in place, including investor demand for higher-yielding securities and the postive -- for bond traders -- economic fundamentals. And this means that there is still a lot of support for prices and yields around the 6 percent level on the 30-year bond, the 5.45 percent level on the 10-year note and the 3.85 percent level for the two-year note.
Even if the market settles into a trading range for a while, the bias is still toward lower interest rates and the risk of an upward spike is, for now, very low. But this means the market could also be extremely volatile, making sharp swings as it did in one day yesterday or over several days, as as it did last Thursday, when it sold off, and Friday when prices rebounded.
 
A 'Two-Way' Market
 "We are now in a two-way trading type of market," said William Pike, who runs the primary dealer operation at Chemical Securities. "It is not a one-way market anymore. But there is no evidence for me to conclude that the bull market is over."
One of the forces supporting prices is the continued demand by many investors for higher yields, which is prompting many of them to buy longer-term maturities.
That demand was clearly evident yesterday as portfolio managers and other institutional investors snapped up a record $5.5 billion of Italian global issues, with $3.5 billion of that amount in 30-year bonds and the rest in 10-year notes.
"The flows are still favorable," said Glen E. Murphy, chief investment officer at Travelers Asset Management International in Hartford, of the cash coming into the market looking for higher yield. "People are still wanting to buy bonds."
The successful sale of the Italian bonds, which will be formally completed today, also lifted a worry among traders about its reception and the impact of such a huge supply of new securities, and contributed to the rally in the afternoon, Mr. Pike said.
 
Little Risk Seen
 Another support for prices is that slow economic growth and moderate inflation, which is the picture still being drawn by current economic data, means that securities do not have to move far below their recent peaks in price and lows in yields before they become attractive again.
Mr. Murphy said he did not think 10-year notes were a good value at 5.22 percent, the 25-year low reached last week, but they were quite attractive at a yield around 5.50 percent. Yesterday, with the yield driving to 5.47 percent, he was taking some of the cash he had accumulated in the last several months and buying 10-year notes.
"I see little risk in the market at 5.5 percent," he said.
Mr. Pike said he saw the same kind of buying support in the market yesterday. "There was retail buying on weakness," he said, referring to the buying by portfolio managers and other money managers. "And if we were in a market with a less favorable climate there would not be that kind of buying."
 
A Successful Debut For Italian Bonds
 Italy made its first foray ever into the long end of the global bond market, with its $5.5 billion issue of 30-year bonds and 10-year notes easily outdistancing the previous high of $3 billion. The bonds, which will be formally priced today, are also the first Italian Government bonds to be sold in the United States.
Alberto Giovannini, the head of the council of experts at the Italian Treasury, said the demand for the issue was very strong. He said the Italian Government chose to issue 30-year bonds now because there was a strong demand for long-dated issues and because long-term interest rates in the United States were so low.
He said it was expected that with the final sale, the yield on the 30-year bonds would be 80 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the yield on the 7.125 percent, 30-year bond due in February 2023. The yield was at 6.13 percent yesterday. The 10-year notes will yield 62 basis points over the current 10-year note.

HEADLINE: Concert Hall Aims for Hartford's Revival

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Sept. 15

 BODY:
In yet another effort to make over Hartford into a regional center for night life and entertainment, Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. unveiled plans today for a 30,000-seat indoor-outdoor concert amphitheater to be built on the edge of the city's impoverished North End.
Mr. Weicker said that, barring snags, ground would be broken this fall for the $20 million project, a joint venture between the state and two private developers. It is to be finished, he said, in time for next summer's pop and rock concert tours, many of which have skipped Connecticut for lack of a place to perform. 
 "The turning of shovels is imminent," the Governor said. "This is not something that is a year out."
The developers -- the Nederlander Organization of Chicago and Metropolitan Entertainment Inc., a New York-area concert promoter -- said the design would be the first of its type in the world, with 7,500 seats that could be fully enclosed for winter use, and 22,500 more on a grassy bank for summer shows. The developers said they expected to book 80 concerts a year, drawing 400,000 to 500,000 people into the city, and that the theater would employ about 600 local teen-agers under an arrangement that ties a theater job to good grades in school.
The Connecticut Center for the Performing Arts, as the theater complex is to be known, is the latest in a series of aggressive steps by the state to advance the idea of Connecticut's economically troubled capital city as a destination for fun.
This summer, Connecticut rescued the financially floundering Hartford Whalers hockey team in a deal that, among other things, gave the state control of parking and the skyboxes at the Whalers' arena, the Hartford Civic Center. Next week, a special legislative session will consider the cost and benefits of wooing the New England Patriots football team south from Massachusetts to a 60,000-seat stadium that the Governor wants to build in Hartford.
Mr. Weicker said today that the goal is to achieve a critical mass of attractions that increases the allure of Hartford, large parts of which empty at 5 P.M. as office workers head home to the suburbs.
"With the Civic Center and the Whalers, and now the Center for the Performing Arts, we're achieving that critical mass," he said.
Hartford's Mayor, Carrie Saxon Perry, said the prospect of summer jobs for teen-agers -- who, she declared, might otherwise be lured into gangs -- was one of the plan's most important elements. Under the arrangement, the theater will guarantee each of Hartford's three public high schools a specific number of part-time summer jobs. Competition for those jobs will be based in part on grade-point average -- with 3.0 or better as cutoff for applicants.
"The job component of this project is extraordinarily important," she said. "It is another choice for those who want access out of these gangs."
State economic development officials said that they expected few significant delays.
Under a program created last year by the Legislature, bonds can be sold for such projects, with the principal and interest payments based on taxes generated by the project -- including, in the case of the theater, a 10 percent admissions tax. No bond issue has yet been floated for this project, and a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Economic Development, Joseph Cohen, said that the final mixture of financing sources -- bonds, loans from the state and grants -- had not been worked out.
Jim Koplik, president of Metropolitan Entertainment, said he did not think the new arena would directly compete with the Civic Center because the older 15,000-seat auditorium was not drawing many shows anyway, especially in the summer when many performers and fans prefer outdoor performances. In the winter, he said, the new theater with its enclosed 7,500-seat space could provide a smaller house than the Civic Center for performers who cannot fill big halls.
Officials at Nederlander, which has built theater complexes around the country, said that a 20-foot wall behind the outdoor seats would shield nearby neighborhoods from concert noise, and that the wall would provide insulation, as well, from Interstate 91 nearby.
A huge landfill just off I-91 that in high summer sends a foul aroma drifting across much of the area will also not be a problem, according to the developers. "The smell, thank goodness, doesn't head in our direction," Mr. Koplik said.

HEADLINE: Fed Fears a Market Bubble If It Lowers Interest Rates

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Seeking to forestall pressures to cut interest rates to lift the still-sluggish economy, several Federal Reserve officials have put forward a new -- and surprising -- reason why it would be unwise to lower rates: It could encourage a speculative bubble in stocks and bonds.
In interviews this week, two central bank officials voiced fears that lower rates could cause runaway investment that would push financial markets to unjustifiable levels, setting the stage for an inevitable plunge. 
 David W. Mullins Jr., the Federal Reserve's vice chairman, and Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor, suggested that the central bank needed to help prevent a replay of Japan's speculative bubble and subsequent slump. In the late 1980's, low interest rates there fueled a huge rise in stock and real estate prices. When that bubble burst, Japan slid into its current deep slump.
Mr. Mullins said, "That's one reason to be wary of being more accommodative," that is to say, of cutting rates further.
Mr. Mullins, who is widely viewed as the Fed's most influential member after its chairman, Alan Greenspan, was quick to add that America's near-record stock and bond prices did not now appear to be inflated. In his view, stock and bond levels are consistent with the recent decline in inflation and the prospect of moderate economic growth.
Lower inflation pushes up the bond market by making a fixed-income investment more valuable, and it also helps drive up stock prices for several reasons: for instance, it increases the chances of higher corporate profits and it encourages bank depositors to shift their money into the stock market.
Nonetheless, Mr. Mullins said, "Some people are concerned about the possibility that excess liquidity will create imbalance, such as a bubble in asset prices."
The concern at the Fed seems to be that strong growth in some measures of the money supply, fueled in part by the lowest interest rates in two decades, could create speculative frenzy.
Early last year, many economists urged the Fed to cut rates to spur the economy. Long-term interest rates have, indeed, come down sharply since then, but the Federal Reserve has not adjusted short-term rates since Sept. 4, 1992, making it one of the longest periods that the Fed has left rates unchanged. The pressures to cut rates largely abated last winter when economic growth picked up.
But with growth at a meager 1.3 percent in the first half and inflation slowing in recent months, a growing number of economists, including Paul Samuelson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are again urging the Federal Reserve to cut its short-term rates.
Although Administration officials would probably like the Fed to lower rates, they have not put pressure on the central bank.
 
Fed Seems Unfazed
 Although long-term rates shot up this week on Tuesday's report that consumer prices rose by three-tenths of 1 percent last month -- slightly more than expected -- Federal Reserve officials hardly seemed fazed.
"It's statistically in line with recent experience," Mr. Lindsey said. "It isn't bad, but it could be better."
The central bankers disputed the President's economic advisers, who warned this week against raising rates soon in light of the recent slowdown in growth and inflation.
Speaking about the current short-term interest rates of 3 percent, Mr. Lindsey said, "I'd call them accommodative." In his view, rates are low enough to support steady growth.
Echoing Mr. Greenspan's Congressional testimony in July, Mr. Mullins and Mr. Lindsey seemed to lay the groundwork for a rate increase, not tomorrow or the next week, but in coming months.
 
In the Bully Pulpit
 When price increases suddenly picked up last winter, Mr. Lindsey used his bully pulpit to warn that the Fed would not let inflationary expectations get out of hand. This week, however, Mr. Lindsey appeared in no rush to raise rates because inflation has simmered down since last winter and growth remains lackluster.
The tenor of Mr. Mullins's remarks was that an interest rate increase was inevitable, but probably not soon. He cautioned that real short-term interest rates -- the interest rate minus the inflation rate -- have been at zero or negative in recent months.
At such times in the past, "the results haven't been pleasant at all," he said. "That happened in the 1970's, and was followed by a period of rapid inflation."
In an interview this week, Alan Blinder, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said there was no need to consider raising rates. Speaking about real interest rates, he said, "I think you can stay pretty near zero for a long period of time. Zero short-term rates are not historically aberrant."
 
Surprise at Fed Case
 Other economists expressed surprise at the case the Fed officials were making for higher rates. David M. Jones, chief economist for Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York brokerage firm, said he was surprised that Fed officials were so concerned that low rates could produce a speculative boom. He said low rates were helping to achieve one of the Fed's main goals: strengthening bank and corporate balance sheets.
Last May, the Federal Reserve's main policy-making committee effectively voted to raise rates if inflation did not simmer down. But with inflation down appreciably over the last six months, some economists predict that at its meeting next Tuesday, the committee will adopt a neutral stance. Some economists argue that it will maintain a bias toward higher rates mainly to show it will remain tough on inflation.
Mr. Mullin said he had finally solved a mystery that has engrossed the Fed: Why did inflation suddenly shoot up at a rate of more than 4 percent last winter?
The final clue, he said, came last month when the Commerce Department revised its 1992 growth estimate to 2.6 percent, not 2.1 percent as previously estimated, and by a robust 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter.
"What happened last winter," Mr. Mullin said, "was that businesses that had been very reluctant to try to increase prices for several years felt the economy might be taking off in the second half of last year." This encouraged them to try to raise prices.

HEADLINE: Stocks Advance on Triple-Witching's Spell

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
The stock market sank under steep losses early in the session yesterday and then recovered on program buying associated with tomorrow's "triple witching" expiration of options and futures contracts.
Triple-witching days -- the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index futures and stock index options -- normally occur on the third Friday of each month. Yesterday, however, traders planning to be absent for the Jewish Rosh ha-Shanah holiday today apparently began limiting their exposure in advance, bringing volatility to the day's trading. 
 The market started the day by plunging 29 points, as long-term interest rates rose sharply on inflation concerns, with the 30-year bond yield as high as 6.07 percent. But around noon, the computerized buying of stocks began to erase the losses, driving the Dow Jones industrials sharply higher to close up 17.89 points, at 3,633.65. Yields on the 30-year bond eventually settled down as well, at 5.97 percent, unchanged.
 
Switch to Cash Position
 Phil H. Smyth, an analyst for Birinyi Associates, said: "Generally, as you approach the expiration day, one thing that you get is index funds, which may have previously purchased futures and options, switching over to a cash position. They do that either by waiting until the last day and letting the options expire, or they close out their futures position while at the same time running a buy program to establish the position in an underlying stock."
Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at the Kemper Securities Group in Chicago, said he thought the economic news that buffeted the bond market had little to do with the stock market's swift changes.
"Of late, stocks and bonds, even though they still are maintaining a close relationship, are not as closely related as they used to be," he said, adding that the market's moves were partly "a bond-market upturn, but that's not the whole reason."
Mr. Chalasani added: "If you look at the intensity of the buying that took place later in the day, after a persistent selloff in the morning, and if you realize that the propensity of buying accelerated in the afternoon, which is indicative of program-related buying, you see that it is related to triple-witching."
 
Heavy Trading Volume
 Volume was heavy yesterday at 298.3 million shares, up from 258.7 million on Tuesday.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed at 461.60, up 1.70. The American Stock Exchange composite index ended at 453.74, up 0.98, and the Nasdaq composite index rose to 739.55, up 6.91.
Among the strongest sectors of the market were the technology stocks. Intel was up 1 5/8, to 64 7/8; Motorola was up 2 5/8, to 93; Lotus was up 2 1/2, to 38 1/2; Microsoft was up 1 1/4, to 76 1/2; Applied Materials was up 3 1/4, to 71 5/8, and Micron Technology was up 1 5/8, to 58 3/8.
The auto makers also did relatively well, with Chrysler up 7/8, to 45 1/2; Ford Motor up 1, to 54 3/4, and General Motors up 1 1/2, to 47 1/4.
A big loser was the Walt Disney Company, which suffered when an analyst cut his earnings estimates. The stock fell 1 1/2, to 39 1/8.
Federal Express gained sharply to close at 58 3/4, up 3 3/8, after it said its first-quarter earnings had more than tripled, to a point beyond what analysts had expected.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls Against Mark But Gains a Little on the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the German mark yesterday to its lowest point in about three months, but it rose slightly against the Japanese yen.
In late New York trading, the dollar tumbled to 1.5945 marks, from 1.6090 marks on Tuesday. It edged up to 106 yen from 105.98 yen. 
 Meanwhile, prices for gold rose for the second consecutive day as it tried to recover from steep losses on Friday and Monday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for October delivery gained $2.70 to close at $347.90 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $347.40 an ounce, up $2.60.
 
 
Brazilian Debt
 Traders said the mark rose against most currencies partly because of a restructuring of Brazilian debt in Europe. The deal involved Brazil's purchase of long-term, mark-denominated bonds to serve as collateral for the repayment of the debt, traders said. The purchase stimulated demand for the mark.
In addition, European central banks were continuing to replenish mark reserves they had used up to defend their currencies during July's exchange-rate turmoil, traders said.
"All of the dollar-selling activity we saw today was the result of variables not associated with the dollar" in terms of its economic fundamentals, Belal Khan, senior foreign exchange dealer at the Bank of Tokyo Ltd., said in New York.
 
 
Trade Surplus
 The dollar rose against the yen a day before the Japanese Government is expected to announce a package of measures to stimulate its economy. The package is expected to address Japan's growing trade surplus with the United States, which has pushed the yen higher this year since importers need to buy more yen to pay for their purchases.
Lisa Finstrom, a currency analyst at Smith Barney Shearson, predicted the dollar would get a boost from the announcement. However, she said, "on second thought, people will have a lot of questions" on whether the package will be carried out and how much effect it would have on the trade deficit.
Among other currencies, the British pound rose to $1.5495 in New York, from $1.5460 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Reynolds Cutbacks May Signal Wide Job Loss in Tobacco

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's announcement that it would cut 1,000 workers is just the beginning of job cuts for an industry where price wars have eroded profits and new legislation threatens to narrow earnings further, analysts said yesterday.
"This was expected, and I definitely think there will be more cuts," said Howard Penney, an analyst for Morgan Stanley. "As the price structure of domestic tobacco has changed, companies need to get their cost structure commensurate as soon as possible." 
 In a letter distributed Tuesday at the company's headquarters in Winston-Salem, N.C., James W. Johnston, chairman and chief executive of Reynolds, a unit of the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, said that as many as 1,000 workers, about 9 percent of the work force, would be dismissed.
 
Message to Employees
 "I am well aware that the single most important question in many of your minds right now is whether you will lose your job," he wrote. "Regrettably, the answer is that some of you will."
The industry's drastic price reductions began in April, when the Philip Morris Companies slashed Marlboro prices by 40 percent and other companies followed. After that, R. J. Reynolds, the nation's second-largest tobacco company behind Morris, saw its second-quarter earnings fall 37 percent. Mr. Johnston said that expectations for the third and fourth quarters were worse and that he expected the company to earn $900 million less for the entire year than it did in 1992.
It is uncertain, however, exactly how many employees will be affected as the company tries to trim costs. "Things are still shaking out," Maura Payne Ellis, a company spokeswoman, said yesterday, adding that the final number would depend upon the extent to which the various political and economic changes influence sales.
Primary among those concerns is how much the Federal excise tax on cigarettes, now at 24 cents a pack, is increased under the financing provisions of the Clinton Administration's health care program. As Mr. Johnston told his employees, "If a tax increase reduces cigarette sales, jobs will be lost throughout the tobacco industry."
 
Other Cost-Cutting Plans
 He stressed, however, that the company was trying to cut costs in other ways. "Most of our cost reductions will come from reducing nonpersonnel costs associated with developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling our products," he wrote.
RJR Nabisco stock was unchanged yesterday, closing at $4.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Mr. Penney said he expected all American tobacco companies, including Philip Morris, would be forced to dismiss employees.
"This is a process that takes time; it doesn't happen overnight," he said. "Philip Morris hasn't announced any cuts yet, but they probably will. They just need some time to assess their position, to see where they're going. But I'm sure they will do it as soon as it's possible."

HEADLINE: Pickup in the Economy Is Seen in Two Reports

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Fresh reports suggested today that the economy would pick up a bit during the second half of the year. One showed businesses with lean inventories, and another indicated that consumers were paying their debts more easily.
Inventories of goods fell five-tenths of a percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $860.3 billion, the Commerce Department said. The decline was the first since September and the steepest since March 1991. Inventories were unchanged in June. 
 Also, the American Bankers Association said the percentage of Americans behind on their consumer loan payments fell during the second quarter to the lowest level in nine years.
 
Better Second Half Seen
 "Both numbers bode for slightly stronger economic performance in the second half of the year than we had in the first half," said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a government-securities dealer in New York. The loan delinquency rate decline "should support slightly higher consumer spending," he said.
Difficulty by businesses in reducing an inventory buildup slowed economic growth in the April-June quarter, but stocks now are at a level that should not impede future growth, he said.
Much of the July inventory decline was the result of a 4.9 percent fall in auto dealers' stocks, the largest decline in nearly seven years.
However, business sales were weak in July. They fell 1.1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $583.6 billion. It was the biggest drop since December 1991.
At the retail level, inventories fell 1.3 percent. They were flat at factories and down two-tenths of a percent at wholesalers.
July sales were weakest at factories, where they fell 2.6 percent. They edged down a tenth of a percent at wholesalers and rose three-tenths of a percent at retailers. In an advance report on Tuesday, the department said retail sales rose two-tenths of a percent in August.
 
Delinquencies Drop
 The bankers association said a seasonally adjusted 2.06 percent of consumer loans were 30 days or more past due at the end of June, down from 2.31 percent at the end of the first quarter and 2.6 percent a year earlier.
The latest rate, a composite of eight types of installment loans, was the lowest since 2.02 percent at the end of June 1984.
Economists said slow-but-steady improvement in the job market, low inflation and extensive mortgage refinancing had improved consumers' ability to repay their loans.
"Consumers are halfway home in terms of redressing their balance sheet," said an economist, Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "They are midway between what could be considered a healthy debt level and the dire situation they had gotten into by the late 1980's."
The report also showed that the delinquency rate for bank credit cards, which are not included in the composite rate, dropped to 2.63 percent at the end of June from 2.74 percent at the end of March.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Judging Lorenzo, air regulators are where they didn't want to be.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IS Frank Lorenzo, devil to organized labor and hero to the budget traveler, fit to run an airline? The legal battle to certify ATX, Mr. Lorenzo's carrier modeled on the successful Southwest Airlines, was expected to be fought over the issue of whether previous bankruptcies and a blemished aircraft maintenance record should keep the Houston entrepreneur's planes on the ground.
But the drama abruptly veered toward farce last week, when a Federal administrative law judge decided he did not like the tactics or manners of Mr. Lorenzo and his lawyers and recommended that the former boss of Continental and Eastern airlines be sent packing. Now the onus rests firmly on the Department of Transportation, which must decide whether Congress really, truly meant to deregulate the market for air transportation. 
 In March, ATX applied for permission to start an airline based in Baltimore. The idea was (and is) to offer low-priced service on short, densely trafficked routes where the established carriers now charge premium fares.
New airline applications are routinely approved, provided the owner has a bit of cash in the bank and the wherewithal to keep the wings bolted on. Just last month, the Government certified Renown Aviation to start flights to the Bahamas in spite of the fact that its parent company owed the Internal Revenue Service $1.1 million and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation more than $1.7 million.
Oh yes, there were also questions of safety: The new owner once had an airline called TPI International that ran afoul of Federal aircraft maintenance rules on numerous occasions.
But Renown's chief executive had never offended the airline pilots', mechanics' and baggage handlers' unions, which persuaded some 120 members of Congress to declare their opposition to the Lorenzo certification.
The Transportation Department ordered ATX to supply reams of documents regarding the hundreds of lawsuits filed against Lorenzo-related airlines over the last decade. And it took the unusual step of appointing an administrative law judge to hold hearings, giving the unions an opportunity to attack Mr. Lorenzo's fitness.
The idea apparently was to insulate the department from criticism when it eventually followed precedent and gave the green light to ATX. But the judge, Robert L. Barton Jr., apparently had his own ideas.
He sparred for two months with ATX's lawyers over who was responsible for the failure to produce every document requested by the Government. Many were the property of Mr. Lorenzo's adversaries, who were understandably unenthusiastic about aiding his paper chase. Finally on July 30, the department ordered Judge Barton to get on with it, arguing that a substantial portion of the missing material "appears to be of peripheral relevance to the proceeding."
The department's order was buttressed by the Public Counsel, the Government's official representative at the hearings. "The burden of providing evidence now shifts to the other parties," wrote the department's assistant general counsel for aviation enforcement.
In an unexpected turn of events, however, Judge Barton pulled the plug. Without hearing the unions' case to the contrary, he ruled that ATX was indeed financially fit and managerially competent to run an airline. But the judge, who was not available for comment, decided that ATX had ailed to demonstrate a "proper compliance disposition."
For one thing, the judge wrote, ATX's lawyers had filed "unsupported, frivolous and vexatious pleadings" during the long summer of his discontent. For another, Mr. Lorenzo was not a credible witness, a finding based in part on the judge's "careful observation of the demeanor (including pauses, facial gestures and body language) of the witnesses."
All this leaves the department precisely where it did not want to be. The Government could follow the judge's recommendation, an unlikely course in light of its counsel's own pleading. It could certify ATX -- almost as unlikely a choice, since the unions never got their day in court. The betting now is that the department will order the judge to reopen the hearings and complete the record, then decide that ATX is at least as fit as Renown to put planes in the air.
There is the temptation to accent the positive, namely the entertainment value of watching the department hoisted with its own petard. But many economists wonder why, 15 years after the airline market was deregulated, this show is taking place at all. Safety, everyone's premier concern, is primarily the responsibility of the Federal Aviation Administration. And outright abuse of consumers -- stranding passengers at the gate -- has become an extremely rare event in spite of the wrenching dislocations in the airline business.
"The intent of deregulation was to encourage new entry," concludes John Robson, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation who was the airlines' chief regulator in the Ford Administration. "That's what keeps the game honest."

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Islanders Sign Turgeon To a 4-Year Contract

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNIONDALE, L.I., Sept. 15

 BODY:
By making Pierre Turgeon one of hockey's 10 highest-paid players today, Don Maloney and the Islanders hope they sent a signal across Long Island and through the National Hockey League, a message that carries beyond the payroll.
In agreeing to pay Turgeon an average of $2.75 million per season on a four-year contract, the Islanders hope they have begun to shed a negative reputation that surrounded the franchise during its Great Recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's. 
 "Every time you turned around the Islanders were seen as a third-rate organization," Maloney said today at a luncheon in the Long Island Marriott hotel. "Nobody gave a darn. That was the image the franchise seemed to take on."
Without conceding the truth of the perception, Maloney did admit: "Maybe we did sit back, five, six or seven years ago, and put our feet up and close our eyes as the world passed us by."
By signing Turgeon to the largest contract in team history, Maloney said: "We made a point. We will stay up with the big boys. We can play the game."
 
It's All in the Marketing
 The deal includes the right to market Turgeon's image on commercial products such as shirts, Maloney said, although Turgeon will retain any product-marketing rights, such as those for trading cards, that are negotiated by the Players Association in the new collective bargaining agreement with the team owners.
Similar deals involving marketing rights have been made in recent months between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Mario Lemieux and by the Ottawa Senators with Alexandre Daigle. In addition, the Islanders are taking offers from three local public relations firms and will choose one to coach Turgeon on public speaking and image.
The winner of the Lady Byng Trophy for skillful and gentlemanly play, Turgeon is a polite but shy 24-year-old from French Canada who still struggles with English as a second language. That will change, Maloney said, as Turgeon buys a home on Long Island, maintains year-round residence and represents the team at local events.
 
A Bargain in the Making?
 "We don't expect him to become Dale Carnegie or Anthony Robbins in the next month," said Maloney, who compared Turgeon to Jean Beliveau because he has "a quiet dignity about him." As for Turgeon's pay scale, Maloney predicted, "We're hoping that three years from now it'll be a real bargain."
Turgeon joined the team in October 1991 in a multiplayer deal that sent Pat LaFontaine to Buffalo. LaFontaine had refused to play for the team because of a salary dispute that epitomized the image of the team in that era. Last season, his sixth in the N.H.L., Turgeon had a career-high 132 points on 58 goals and 74 assists. He is a center with advanced puck-handling skills, a deceptive shot and above-average skating ability. Moreover, Turgeon makes those around him better, creating scoring opportunities for linemates. His teammates call him Sneaky Pete.
Turgeon, as is his style, was cordial and smiling at today's luncheon, accompanied by his wife, Elizabeth, and their twin daughters, Alexandra and Elizabeth. "There's pressure there," Turgeon said. "The attention is there. I get paid well. The money's there. My main thing is to go on the ice and play hockey."
 
A Paycheck Passage
 Just where Turgeon's salary ranks among other stars is a little difficult to determine at this point. Lemieux leads all players at $5 million per year, with Eric Lindros second at $3.556 million and Wayne Gretzky third at $3 million. Turgeon's average salary of $2.75 million would rank him fourth in the N.H.L. this season, if he is indeed paid that figure this season. Sometimes, however, salaries on multiyear contracts are distributed in such a way that they will grow over the length of the contract.
In addition, several star players are negotiating contracts that should put them in a higher bracket. Among them are Ray Bourque of Boston, Chris Chelios of Chicago and Doug Gilmour of Toronto. Patrick Roy of Montreal this week signed a new contract for $16 million over four seasons. On average, that puts him ahead of Turgeon, $4 million to $2.75 million, but Roy will make only $2.70 million of it this season.
Players' salaries have increased dramatically over the past few years in part because union members voted in 1990 to share pay information. Once the going rate for top talent became widely known, other star players had a plateau from which to bargain.

HEADLINE: Investigators' Findings in Holtzman Loan Inquiry

 BODY:

 Following is the concluding passage of a New York City Department of Investigation report summarizing the findings of an inquiry into a campaign loan to the City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman:
 
 
 
Subject to Ethics Rules
 Fleet Bank's $450,000 loan to the Holtzman Senate Campaign Committee is not excepted from the Charter's ethics proscriptions because it was not made to Holtzman and was, by the bank's definition, an "undesirable" loan, which could be made only by certain designated bank officers for a "justifiable business reason." 
 The Charter permits public officials to receive loans from banks doing business with the city only if the loan was obtained on terms and conditions available to the public. Although Holtzman guaranteed the $450,000 loan to her campaign committee, she was not the recipient of the loan. For this reason alone, the loan is not one excluded from the reach of the Charter's ethics proscriptions.
In addition, Fleet Bank's Commercial Credit Policy Manual characterizes campaign loans as "undesirable." Such loans are generally not available to candidates for public office and, by definition, are not available to members of the general public.
The evidence, in particular the memorandum Fleet Bank Loan Officer Nancy O'Connor prepared when reviewing the loan application, indicates that the loan was made to generate goodwill for Fleet Financial Group ("FFG") in continuation of FFG executive James Murphy's campaign to obtain business from the Comptroller's Office through contacts with senior-level officials in the Comptroller's Office and financial assistance to Holtzman's political campaigns. According to O'Connor's memorandum, the loan was not made because it was by itself a sound business transaction but, rather, because it would "support the bank's relationship with [Holtzman]."
 
Entering a Relationship
 In guaranteeing the $450,000 loan from Fleet Bank to her Senate campaign committee, Holtzman entered into a financial relationship with a subsidiary of FFG, which was doing and actively seeking business with the Comptroller's Office.
In June 1990, the Comptroller's Office entered into an agreement with the Norstar Mortgage Company, a division of Fleet Real Estate Funding Corporation, in connection with "Project Home," a $100 million program to help low- and moderate-income families obtain home mortgages. Holtzman attended a press conference at City Hall in August 1990 announcing the initiation of the program.
In September 1990, the Comptroller's Office issued a press release announced that Norstar Bank, a subsidiary of FFG, was participating in a $50 million program to provide low-interest loans to small business.
From 1990 through 1992, executives from FFG and Fleet Securities met and corresponded with senior officials of the Comptroller's Office in an effort to obtain a role in managing city pension funds and city municipal bond offerings. These officials included, in addition to Holtzman: Edward O'Malley, deputy comptroller and chief of staff; Michael Nairne, the Comptroller's delegate to the city's four pension boards on which the Comptroller sits; Darcy Bradbury, deputy comptroller for Finance; William Paolino, bureau chief for Asset Management; John Gilliam, deputy comptroller for Asset Management, and Thomas Bettridge, director of Targeted Investments.
For these reasons, FFG clearly had business dealings with the Comptroller's Office, and the Comptroller's Office necessarily, therefore, has taken actions affecting FFG, either in the administration of business FFG was already performing or in assessing whether to consider the company for new business.
 
Participated in Process
 Holtzman participated in the process leading to her office's recommendation and selection of Fleet Securities to be a co-manager.
Holtzman delegated the work of screening and evaluating candidates for senior and co-managers to Darcy Bradbury and her staff. However, she did not recuse herself from the selection process. The selections were made pursuant to her personal authority as Comptroller, and she, with Mayor Dinkins, personally announced the selections in a joint press release on March 17, 1993, which listed Fleet Securities as one of 23 co-managers. In addition, she participated in two aspects of the selection process: the evaluation of candidates for senior manager and the appointment of minority- and women-owned firms to co-manager positions. Finally, on April 1, 1993, she personally approved a "tombstone," which also listed Fleet Securities as a co-manager, that provided public notice of the initial bond offering.
 
Suggestion of Knowledge
 The evidence strongly suggests that Holtzman knew that FFG, Fleet Securities, or other FFG subsidiaries were doing and seeking business with the Comptroller's Office.
The following facts strongly suggest that Holtzman knew that FFG, Fleet Securities, and other FFG subsidiaries were doing or seeking business with her Office. First and most strikingly, Holtzman attended a meeting in June 1992 at the Vista Hotel with executives of Fleet Securities, who pitched the firm's qualifications for 45 minutes to an hour and specifically asked that the firm be considered for co-manager status.
Second, senior aides on her staff and campaign committee, including Deputy Comptroller Edward O'Malley, her closest political aide and the director of two of her campaigns for Comptroller and the Senate, and Campaign Finance Director Sheila Levin, and a senior adviser, Joseph McDonald, were aware as of January 1993 that Fleet Securities had applied for co-manager status. Ostensibly, to avoid an appearance of impropriety, they therefore refused to discuss repayment of the Fleet Bank loan. Each knew that Holtzman was distressed that the bank was pressing for repayment. Yet Holtzman contended that they did not inform her that they had put the bank off or that she faced a conflict of interest based on Fleet Securities' application to be a co-manager. Given the importance of both issues to Holtzman, and the close professional relationship of O'Malley, Levin and McDonald to her, it is unlikely, in DOI's opinion, that she was not informed that Fleet Securities was seeking to be selected as a co-manager.
Third, Fleet Securities was identified as one of the firms selected for co-manager in documents it would be expected she would review, including the press release announcing the selection of senior managers and co-managers, and the "tombstone" announcing the initial bond offering.
Fourth, two FFG subsidiaries participated in loan programs administered by the Comptroller's Office and executives of FFG and its subsidiaries had numerous contacts with senior officials of the Comptroller's Office in an effort to get business.
Holtzman was grossly negligent in failing to ascertain whether FFG, or any company related to FFG, was doing or seeking business with her office before her campaign committee sought the $450,000 loan from Fleet Bank and before she participated in the process in which Fleet Securities was selected as a co-manager.
Under the Charter, Holtzman had an affirmative obligation to learn whether FFG, Fleet Securities or other FFG subsidiaries had business dealings with her office before and after she guaranteed the $450,000 loan from Fleet Bank to her campaign committee.
Holtzman testified that she was unaware that Fleet Bank or any company related to it had business dealings with her office. While her assertions of ignorance are contradicted by substantial evidence, the record is devoid of evidence indicating that she took affirmative steps to ascertain whether Fleet Bank or any company related to it had business dealings with her office before authorizing her campaign committee to seek the loan and before she personally guaranteed the loan. Given that Fleet Bank was a major financial institution doing business in New York (which Holtzman knew since it was her bank), reasonable care should have led her to inquire whether the bank had done or was seeking business with her office in order to avoid a conflict of interest.
After the loan was obtained, the potential for a conflict of interest to arise continued. Having guaranteed the loan and assumed a contractual financial obligation to the bank of approximately $200,000, Holtzman could not involve herself in any matters in which the bank had a direct or indirect interest. Nevertheless, while there is evidence that Holtzman knew that Fleet Securities was a candidate for co-manager, the record is devoid of evidence that she took any affirmative action to learn whether the bank, or any company-related to the bank had business dealings with her office.
Holtzman's failure to inquire whether Fleet Bank or companies related to it were doing or seeking business with her office constitutes, in this department's opinion, gross negligence.

HEADLINE: Perot Leads Attack on Trade Agreement

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
A day after President Clinton mobilized three former Presidents to answer criticisms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the pact's opponents resumed their attacks, with Ross Perot leading the charge.
On two television talk shows, Mr. Perot warned that the agreement would throw up to five million Americans out of work, destroy the American middle class and wreck the Federal Government's tax base. 
 If approved by Congress, the agreement would gradually eliminate trade and investment barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States. Advocates contend this will create American jobs through rising exports to Mexico, but opponents like Mr. Perot maintain that jobs will be lost as American companies move to Mexico.
The treaty has badly divided the Democrats and created considerable intraparty tension. Senator Donald W. Riegle Jr., a Democrat from Michigan, where auto workers are worried that their employers might move factories to Mexico, suggested today at a Senate Finance Committee hearing that Secretary of State Warren Christopher might be biased because Mr. Christopher's former law firm worked for the Mexican Government during the trade negotiations last year.
 
Conflict Is Denied
 Mr. Christopher denied that there was a conflict of interest. He said that as far as he knew the Washington office of the firm O'Melveny & Myers might have done work for the Mexican Government but that he had been in the firm's Los Angeles headquarters and had knownnothing about it.
Despite the Democratic split, a majority of the 20 Senators on the Finance Committee, the main Senate committee with jurisdiction over trade, appears to support the trade agreement. All 9 Republicans are likely to vote for it, and 2 of the 11 Democrats, Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Max Baucus of Montana, expressed support today. But the agreement has a cloudy future in the House, where the Democratic leadership is divided on the pact.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the Finance Committee's chairman, said today that he had invited Mr. Perot to testify before the panel this fall on the agreement, but that no details had been worked out. United We Stand America, Mr. Perot's political organization, could not confirm tonight whether the invitation had been received.
Responding to alarms sent to the White House by free trade supporters in Congress, President Clinton flew today to a hastily arranged rally in New Orleans to support the agreement.
 
Clinton Sees Opportunity
 He appeared at the same Mississippi River wharf where President Bush attacked Mr. Clinton as waffling on his free trade positions last fall just before the general election. President Clinton said that supporting the trade agreement would provide "the opportunity for us to get off the defensive in our economic policies and go on offense."
Neither the President nor the members of Congress who appeared with him today were eager to address the questions raised by Mr. Perot. Mr. Clinton said it was up to reporters to hold Mr. Perot accountable for the statements he makes.
"Why do you guys keep asking that question?" the President snapped at one point when reporters asked whether he was losing the public relations battle to Mr. Perot. "It's not about me and him. It's about the American people and their future. I think the American people will win on this one."
 
Carter Challenged
 But former President Jimmy Carter made a clear allusion to Mr. Perot at a White House ceremony on Tuesday with President Clinton and former Presidents Gerald Ford and George Bush: "Unfortunately, in our country now we have a demagogue who has unlimited financial resources and who is extremely careless with the truth, who is preying on the fears and the uncertainties of the American public."
Mr. Perot responded on NBC's "Today" and in a taping of PBS's "Charlie Rose" for broadcast tonight by suggesting that Mr. Carter was ignorant of how Mexican employees of United States concerns lived. "I think if he ever goes to Mexico and sees how Mexican workers live in one-room shacks with dirt floors, no electricity and no plumbing that work in these big U.S. companies, he will be shocked," Mr. Perot told Mr. Rose.
Today, Robert A. Pastor, a fellow at the Carter Center in Atlanta, said Mr. Carter had helped build 100 homes in Tijuana three years ago. "Carter has traveled through Mexico and he has seen that Mexico has cardboard shacks but also has Monterrey, which is an industrializing city," Mr. Pastor said.
The acrimony and highly political accusations going back and forth have obscured the substance of the agreement, which has repeatedly been inaccurately characterized or distorted by all sides. Mr. Perot, for example, has clung to his predictions of catastrophic effects upon the American economy from the agreement.
On "Today" he said approval of the free trade pact would so undermine the United States economy that the country would be unable to handle the national debt. "You're going to destroy the middle class in this country, and that destroys the tax base, and that eliminates our chance to pay back the debt," he said.
 
No Reply From Perot
 When asked about estimates by business executives and economists that labor represents only 10 or 20 percent of production costs, Mr. Perot gave no direct reply. Instead, he contended that a more accurate impression of the role of wages in industrial location decisions could be inferred from the Mexican state of Yucatan's advertisements and other efforts to lure American businesses with low wages.
Yet dozens of economists have repeatedly pointed out that because Mexico's economy is only 4 percent of the size of the American economy, the overall effects of the free trade agreement on the United States will be very small.
While avoiding Mr. Perot's hyperbole, the White House has also made a few errors. The Administration released two weeks ago a lengthy rebuttal of Mr. Perot's new book, "Save Your Job, Save Our Country: Why NAFTA Must Be Stopped -- Now!" (Hyperion, $6.95), that quotes the book heavily but often inaccurately.
The rebuttal by the Office of the United States Trade Representative uses numerous quotes that appear differently in the book or not at all.
 
Errors Called Clerical
 "It's a clerical mistake, certainly not a deliberate effort," said Anne Luzzatto, the press secretary for the office. She said that the agency had incorrectly used quotation marks when paraphrasing the book's points.
But Patrick Choate, a writer in Washington who helped Mr. Perot with his book, said, "The White House has done exactly what they've accused us of doing and which we didn't do: playing fast and loose."
Twice the trade office's rebuttal alters quotes that might otherwise offend President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, the Administration's close ally in the fight for Congressional approval. Mr. Perot's book, for example, contends that, "Nafta gives Mexican investors, such as the 29 elite businessmen at the Salinas dinner, a distinct competitive advantage in the U.S.-Mexican trucking industry."
The White House repeats the quote but omits, without using ellipses, the reference to the dinner and never explains that the dinner was an occasion for Mr. Salinas to seek political donations of $25 million apiece from businessmen who stood to benefit from the free-trade pact.
In another instance, Mr. Perot's book says, "Multinational corporations have had their eye on Mexico for years -- not as a market of any real consequence, but as a locale for an unlimited supply of cheap, high-quality labor with weak unions and a sympathetic central government."
The White House rebuttal stops with a period after "high-quality labor," omitting "with weak unions and a sympathetic central government."
Ms. Luzzatto responded, "There was no conscious effort to omit comments critical of Salinas."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MACHINE FALTERS IN DETROIT

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 15

 BODY:
A former State Supreme Court Justice handily outpolled two other candidates on Tuesday in a fight to become the city's first mayor in two decades, delivering a blow to the once-powerful political machine of the retiring Mayor, Coleman A. Young.
The former justice, Dennis Archer, won 53 percent, or 95,962 votes, according to complete but unofficial returns. Sharon McPhail, an assistant Wayne County prosecutor who will face him in a nonpartisan runoff on Nov. 2, gathered 36 percent, or 47,733 votes. No woman has ever been mayor of Detroit. 
 Arthur B. Blackwell 2d, chairman of the Wayne County Board of Commissioners, won only 12 percent of the vote. Mr. Blackwell had run as the candidate of Mayor Young, 75, who did not seek re-election because of ill health.
In an interview today, Mr. Archer, 51, said, "I am very pleased with the result, but I expect it will get closer."
That view was echoed by Ms. McPhail, 44, a native of Cambridge, Mass., who said: "He's not the winner. I am one of the two winners."
 
Promises and Papers
 The candidates have each issued a series of detailed position papers calling for fundamental change in many facets of city government. Both have emphasized aiding Detroit's crumbling neighborhoods and have vowed to preserve city workers' jobs and not to contract out services, as some civic groups advocate.
Mr. Archer, who gave up his seat on the State Supreme Court to explore a mayoral candidacy in 1990, has promised to make Detroit "a safe city with an open form of government," to improve delivery of city services and "to boost the employment prospects" of the city's 115,000 unemployed."
Now a partner at one of Detroit's most exclusive law firms, Mr. Archer, endured severe poverty while growing up in the rural Michigan town of Cassopolis. He put himself through college and law school in Detroit.
Ms. McPhail also comes from a disadvantaged background; as a teen-ager, she helped rear six younger brothers and sisters after her father died and her mother was hospitalized. She moved to Detroit in 1975 to be a lawyer at the Ford Motor Company.
 
From Ridicule to Runoff
 Ms. McPhail was a virtual unknown, but she steadily gained support, in part because of her effectiveness as a speaker. "This election will be between the million-dollar man and the million-dollar plan," she said on Tuesday, noting that Mr. Archer had raised $1.6 million to her $172,000.
Ms. McPhail has billed herself as "the only candidate with a law-enforcement background," and she has pledged to make crime-ridden Detroit safer, partly by putting 2,000 more police officers on the streets. She has also promoted a theme of luring business back to Detroit by abolishing the city's corporate income tax, lowering other taxes and offering entrepreneurs the chance to take over some of the city's many abandoned buildings.
Both candidates are black, as are 76 percent of Detroit's one million residents. Mr. Young, the first black Mayor in Detroit's history, frequently assailed Detroit's suburbs, which are overwhelmingly white and have more than three million people. Mr. Archer campaigned on a pledge to "foster a spirit of cooperation between city and suburb," and some suburbanites have been heavy donors to his campaign.
Ms. McPhail has also said there is a need for better relations between city and suburbs.
Mr. Young announced on filing day that he would not seek a fifth four-year term. Polls showed he had lost much of his political support. He said on Tuesday night that Ms. McPhail had asked for his support and that he was considering her request.

Crowded Fields in Minnesota
By The Associated Press
The retirements of two mayors paved the way for crowded fields in primaries in Minnesota on Tuesday, while voters in South Dakota rejected a measure backed by the actor Kevin Costner to increase betting limits in state casinos.
In Minneapolis, 17 candidates sought to replace Mayor Don Fraser, who is retiring after four terms. The top two finishers in the nonpartisan race were Sharon Sayles Belton, the City Council president, and John Derus, a former Hennepin County Commissioner. Ms. Belton, who won 28 percent of the vote, and Mr. Derus, who had 20 percent, will face each other in a November runoff.
A similar situation prevailed across the Mississippi in St. Paul, where Assistant Attorney General Norm Coleman finished first with 28 percent of the vote and State Representative Andy Dawkins came in second with 22 percent among 16 nonpartisan candidates. They will compete in November to replace Mayor Jim Scheibel, who is stepping down after one term.
In a nonpartisan primary in Seattle, Mayor Norm Rice finished far ahead of David Stern, who created the "happy face." They will meet in the November election.
Voters in South Dakota rejected a measure to raise betting limits at gaming halls in Deadwood and at Indian casinos. Fifty-five percent of the voters opposed raising betting limits to $100 from $5. The plan had the support of Mr. Costner and his brother, who wanted to build a $65 million casino resort at Deadwood.

HEADLINE: Census Figures Show a Racial Salary Gap

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 15

 BODY:
Black Americans with college degrees still receive lower pay than white graduates for many jobs, the Census Bureau reported today.
In executive, administrative and managerial jobs, black male college graduates were paid about 77 percent of the amount earned by white male college graduates, the report said. 
 Census figures also showed that the number of black men 25 and over with at least a bachelor's degree rose from 7.7 percent in 1980 to 11.9 percent in 1992. Among black women, the rate rose from 8.1 percent to 12 percent.
Education translated into earnings power for both blacks and whites, but whites were paid more. The annual median salary for black college graduates was $30,910, compared with $18,620 for black high school graduates 25 and older. The median salary for white college graduates was $37,490, compared with $22,370 for white high school graduates 25 and older.
The census report was released in conjunction with the Congressional Black Caucus' annual legislative meeting opening today. The census figures were underscored by a Wall Street Journal analysis of Federal labor records, which found that black workers were the only group to experience a net loss of jobs during the recession of 1990-1991.
Black workers lost 59,479 jobs from July 1990 through March 1991, after three years of gains, the newspaper said. Black employment fell in six of nine major industry groups.
Asians gained 55,104 jobs in the same period, and Hispanics gained 60,040 jobs. Whites gained 71,144 jobs, though they outnumbered blacks nearly eight to one at the companies surveyed.

HEADLINE: Clinton Asserts He Might Bend On Health Plan

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton formally opened his campaign to revise the nation's health care system today by inviting ordinary Americans to the Rose Garden to voice their complaints and by asserting his willingness to compromise on key elements of his plan.
Mr. Clinton told a group of small-business owners who met him later at a hardware store in an industrial area of northeast Washington that he was willing to reconsider elements of his proposal that they say would hurt business owners with 50 to 100 employees.
 
Clinton Considers Plea
 Owners of businesses of this size have been among the most vocally opposed to the President's plan because larger employers are better able to afford insurance for employees, and employers with fewer than 50 workers would be given Government assistance to ease the hardship. 
 "There is no way we can, I don't think, solve every problem, but if there is something we can do for people who have between 50 and 100 employees, if there's something else we need to look at, we ought to do it," Mr. Clinton said.
The White House hopes to set the stage for Mr. Clinton's health care speech to a joint session of Congress next Wednesday by presenting the health plan as a package of proposals that can be adjusted to accommodate complaints from opponents and by stressing the long-term benefits of reshaping the medical system.
"This is the most complicated issue that the United States has had to face in a long time," Mr. Clinton said. "It has a very human face when you deal with the human dimensions of it, but it's extremely complex.
"But the first hurdle is to try to get everybody singing out of the same hymnal, as we say at home."
Mr. Clinton is using this week to lay out the scope of the health care problem.
In the earlier event in the Rose Garden, Mr. Clinton was joined by Vice President Al Gore, Tipper Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has headed the Adminstration's health care task force.
Participants flown in from around the country read letters they had sent to the White House about their problems in getting insurance coverage for everything from multiple sclerosis to nursing home care to AIDS. Their fares were paid by Families U.S.A., a consumer group that supports the health plan.
 
President Sees Sacrifice
 The letters were read under a tent erected in the Rose Garden to protect against rain showers. The readers detailed their fears over losing insurance coverage when they changed jobs or lost employment or made unpalatable choices in order to care for ailing relatives.
Karl Kregor, 55, a self-employed consultant from San Antonio, said he and his wife, who is also self-employed, feared they would be unable to afford insurance when they reached retirement age.
"Maybe language like hostage and blackmail doesn't seem fair," Mr. Kregor said. "But the economic as well as psychological consequences are just as real."
Conceding that some taxpayers would see their premiums rise if coverage is to be extended to address these common concerns, Mr. Clinton said that such steps would nevertheless be necessary to bring what he described as a "wildly inefficient" health care system under control.
"I think most young, healthy, single Americans would be willing to do that to avoid the kind of horror stories we've heard today," he said.
Mrs. Clinton pledged that the Administration would not back down from its commitment to end insurance coverage that excluded people who suffer from preexisting illnesses.
"I never could figure out why insurance companies only wanted to insure people who had never been sick or never would get sick," she said. "I think that eliminates everybody."
Mr. Clinton has acknowledged that some of his fiercest opposition would come from small business owners. He said they needed to be convinced that the extra cost was necessary and worthwhile. Even among the handful of specially invited guests that the Small Business Administration brought to meet the President today, there were complaints about the plan.
"We cannot finance your proposed 7.9 percent payroll tax on the backs of small business without job loss," said Daryl Routzahn, a business owner from Frederick, Md. who said his business had shrunk by two-thirds in the last 18 months while his health care costs tripled. "A mandate will hurt our struggling economy."
Mr. Clinton responded: "We're trying to work this out in a fair way that's bearable. But I believe it will aid the American economy and will help small business growth if we do it properly."
 
Owners Not Mollified
 But Mr. Clinton did not mollify the business owners. Pedro Alonso, the owner of a computer and management consulting concern in Washington, said afterward that he was not satisfied with the plan.
"Right now, it's a matter of mandating health care reform on small business," he said. "But small businesses won't be around to reap those benefits. A lot of us won't be able to be competitive. Who do we pass the cost on to?"
Erskine Bowles, Director of the Small Business Administration, said he did not know what form the relief for small businesses would take, but he defended the overall plan. "Every single company won't win," he said. "That's impossible, O.K.? But the vast majority will."
But as the White House prepares to defend its plan, it is counting on the stories of the families like those who appeared in the Rose Garden to counter a television advertising campaign that denounces the health care proposal as the handiwork of bureaucrats plotting to limit individual choice.
"This is not fair," said Brigitte Burdine of Los Angeles, whose 22-year-old sister, Heather, had her insurance suspended after she contracted AIDS. "No one should be refused top-notch medical care in this country because of financial reasons, and when someone becomes chronically ill, it should not be allowed to wipe out their entire family financially."

HEADLINE: A Primer: Why Economists Favor Free-Trade Agreement

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
When economists of every stripe agree on anything, it is noteworthy. So it is a sign of unusual accord that 300 economists, ranging from conservatives like James M. Buchanan and Milton Friedman to liberals including Paul A. Samuelson and James Tobin, recently signed a letter to President Clinton supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Politicians have spoken so loudly and so often on the free-trade agreement that the economists seem to have been pushed into the background. Depending on who is talking, political leaders have argued that the pact would either send millions of jobs swooshing south to Mexico (Ross Perot) or add hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs to the American economy (Mickey Kantor).
 
'Economically Trivial'
 Most economists say that neither is the case. The letter to President Clinton cited a review of dozens of studies of the trade agreement's impact on American jobs and pay. It concluded that while the signers had minor differences, they concurred that "the effects on the U.S. economy -- both good and bad -- would be small for many years." 
 Some radical economists -- like Samuel Bowles at the University of Massachusetts -- predict large and negative effects from the agreement. But much of the national debate has been grounded more in politics and hyperbole than in economics.
Paul Krugman, a trade economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that for the United States, the agreement is "economically trivial." Professor Krugman supports the treaty, saying he thinks it will help to keep free-market reformers in power in Mexico. He sums up the war of words this way: "The anti-Nafta people are telling malicious whoppers. The pro-Nafta side is telling little white lies."
 
 
Well-Established Theories
 An arsenal of theories and models supports the conclusion that the trade agreement would have a minor economic impact on the United States. Fundamental insights about international trade have not changed much in 250 years; Paul Samuelson, in his legendary textbook, quotes the English philosopher John Stuart Mill as saying the benefit of international trade is "a more efficient employment of the productive forces of the world."
Trade theory describes how international trade affects countries' material well-being as well as the benefits and costs of restrictions like tariffs. The lesson of most trade theory is that while razing barriers may hurt some businesses and workers, it generally raises all countries' incomes.
Perhaps the easiest way to think of trade between two countries is to imagine two people, say one who is very good at growing corn and another who is great at stitching clothes. Each can do both tasks for himself, splitting his time between farming and sewing. But if one farms for both, and the other sews for both, together they could produce more -- and therefore consume more -- by specializing. Economists refer to this as comparative advantage.
Even if one man is better at both activities than the other, it makes sense for each to focus on what he is relatively best at. Janet Reno may well be a faster typist than her secretary, but it is probably still a good idea for her to lead the nation's law enforcement efforts and let her secretary tap out her memos.
Thus, the way economists see it, the gain from knocking down barriers is not more total jobs -- the Attorney General and her assistant still have just one job each -- but greater total productivity and incomes.
"I wouldn't say we're creating more jobs than we're destroying -- that's hype," said Jagdish Bhagwati, a trade expert at Columbia University who signed the letter supporting the agreement. "In the long run, trade only reallocates jobs" among different industries within a country.
 
 
Same Basic Principles
 Trade between countries like the United States and Mexico is obviously a good deal more complicated than a simple example of two people. Americans are 11 times as rich as Mexicans. The United States and Mexico produce thousands of products. Labor and capital stream across borders, with American companies setting up businesses in Mexico City suburbs and Mexican factory hands flocking to Los Angeles. The values of the peso and dollar bobble up and down. Nonetheless, economists say, the same principles hold.
The dozens of models used to assess the pact try to build in some of the complications -- especially the fact that America's factory productivity and wages are seven times as high as Mexico's and that the American economy is 20 times as big.
Some models break the two economies into dozens of industries. Other models focus on the dimensions of economic integration that are generally left out of trade models: potentially larger investment by American companies in Mexico and potentially less illegal migration from Mexico to the United States.
To make the models more realistic, economists gather data on other trading relationships: what happened to low-wage workers in the United States in the 1950's and 1960's when American multinationals planted factories around the world and trade with low-wage countries mushroomed; what happened to investment and jobs in Germany when Spain and Portugal joined the European Community; what happened to employment in the United States after Mexico unilaterally liberalized trade laws in the late 1980's.
 What the models do, essentially, is put numbers on theories. In the last year, the middle-of-the-road Brookings Institution, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the International Trade Commission, a Federal agency independent of the White House, have reviewed all of the trade agreement studies they could find. What is striking is the broad agreement they found among most of the analyses, despite differences in the models and the assumptions.
Take, for example, the question of how much the trade agreement would, by creating a larger market, raise the competitiveness of American companies -- something the Clinton Administration has claimed. Traditional models suggest that the United States does gain, but only modestly.
No studies suggest that the trade agreement could add much more than a tenth of a percentage point to the United States' gross domestic product over a decade or more. That is $6 billion over more than 10 years -- an amount that Americans spend on health care in a few days or the amount by which the American economy grows every couple of weeks.
To some extent, the results are just common sense. American tariffs on Mexican imports are already low, around 4 percent on average, suggesting that United States companies already face plenty of competition -- most of it from American rivals.
"It's a big deal for Mexico, which is moving from a statist to a market economy," said Sherman Robinson, a University of California economist who is consulting with the Council of Economic Advisers. "It's a small deal for us."
What concerns most Americans, however, is how many jobs the trade agreement would create or destroy. Since trade models focus mainly on overall efficiency gains, researchers have had to go beyond the usual trade models for answers, some of which are consistent with trade theory, and some of which are less so.
 
Different Assumptions
 Typical of the divergence are the conclusions reached by Gary C. Hufbauer and Jeffrey J. Schott, economists at the Institute for International Economics, and Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former trade negotiator now at the Economic Strategy Institute. Both groups used macroeconomic models of the United States economy -- the sort that forecasters use to predict how much the economy will grow in the coming year or so -- that allow them to focus on the near term, to try to calculate the agreement's potential impact on employment. The difference in their results stems largely from their different assumptions.
The Hufbauer-Schott model assumed that Mexico would run a trade deficit with the United States well into the 21st century, as Japan and Korea did for long periods during their industrialization. Mr. Prestowitz, who conditionally supports the trade agreement, uses the same type of model but assumes that Mexico would quickly start to repay its foreign debt and export more to the United States than it imports.
The Hufbauer-Schott study concluded that the trade agreement would add 170,000 jobs to the American labor market of 120 million workers, while Mr. Prestowitz found that it would eliminate 420,000 jobs. While the numbers seem strikingly different, neither amounts to a sizable impact on the overall economy over 10 or 15 years.
That does not markedly counter the conclusion of most economists, who are generally skeptical that the trade agreement would significantly affect American jobs. They say the macroeconomic models ignore the fact that once American unemployment gets down to 6 percent or so -- what many economists consider the "normal" level of unemployment -- a deficit or surplus with Mexico would merely shift jobs around -- not change the number of jobs.
More important, the macroeconomic models do not take future monetary policy into account. "If the economy created 500,000 fewer jobs, the Fed would lower interest rates more," Professor Krugman said. "If there were 500,000 more jobs, it would keep rates higher. Over the course of a decade, there is no reason to suppose that the average level of employment will be any different with Nafta than without."
 
Related Issues

 
 Other important issues in the free-trade debate include whether investment would desert the United States for Mexico, and whether competition with Mexico would force American wages -- especially for less skilled workers -- to fall. In these issues, as in the debate over jobs, most studies suggest that the impact will be slight and that the claims of free-trade critics like Ross Perot are not rooted in realistic economic analysis.
Even without models, economists say common sense suggests that the impact on wages and investment cannot be large. They note that Mexico's economy is roughly the size of Los Angeles's, amounting to no more than 4 percent of the United States' gross domestic product. Just as Los Angeles could not absorb a large portion of the new investment in the United States, neither could Mexico.
What's more, American companies have had a host of opportunties to move plants to nearby areas with lower wages, including Puerto Rico or Jamaica. While some have indeed moved, many others have not.
There were similar worries that with economic integration, Spain and Portugal would drain capital from the rest of the European Community. That has not happened.
 
Benefits Seen for Mexico
 If economists are correct that the impact on the United States will be so limited, and the benefits so slight, why are so many calling for passage of the free-trade agreement?
The answer is that they believe it will be good for Mexico. Another widely accepted economic tenet is that poor nations need to export in order to industrialize. Opening the United States market more would strengthen the hand of a pro-American, pro-free market Government in Mexico, and help Mexico's citizens.
Further, the trade agreement might reduce pressures on illegal immigration. And liberalizing trade with a poorer neighbor would, they say, set a positive example for Western Europe to open its market to its formerly Communist neighbors.

HEADLINE: Japan Unveils a Third Plan To Stimulate the Economy

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The Japanese Government today announced its third emergency stimulus package in 13 months, in what economists say is becoming an increasingly futile effort to jump-start an economy whose battery has died.
The program consists of about 6 trillion yen, or roughly $57 billion, of increased public works spending, low interest loans and tax incentives intended to pull the world's second largest economy out of its worst downturn in at least two decades. 
 The new package represents a major test for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who vowed to concentrate on political reform but who has been sidetracked as business conditions have worsened because of the rise in the value of the yen and an unusually cool and wet summer.
Mr. Hosokawa announced the measures at a news conference, calling them "rather bold."
 
Loosening Regulation
 The Government also announced that it would loosen regulations in 94 areas, from allowing small brewers to make beer to allowing customers to buy cellular phones rather than lease them from the phone company. It also said it would take steps to pass on the benefits of the stronger Japanese yen to consumers by lowering electricity and gas rates and promoting lower prices for imported goods.
Economists said, however, that the new efforts would not be strong enough to rescue the economy. And some business leaders here were disappointed that the package did not contain a big cut in income taxes that they had hoped would have given consumers more money to spend on new cars, televisions and clothing. The Government said today that a commission would recommend changes in the tax system by November, all but eliminating the chance of a tax cut this year.
The measures are also not expected to satisfy Washington, which has pushed Japan to cut taxes. The United States wants Japanese consumers to spend more to help the recovery of the sluggish world economy and to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus by buying more imported products.
Although the new package was not officially announced until the Tokyo stock market had closed for the day, the Nikkei average plummeted 445.64 points, or 2.1 percent, to finish at 20,502.15.
And the dollar fell sharply against the yen, as traders anticipated that a disappointed United States would favor a strong yen as a way of reducing Japan's trade surplus. In Tokyo trading today, the dollar closed at 104.62 yen, down 1.13 yen.
The 6 trillion yen in the Prime Minister's stimulus package includes of almost 2 trillion yen, or $19 billion, in public works spending. Half of that will be spending by the national Government on items like art museums and wheelchair ramps, and 500 billion yen more, or $4.8 billion, will be spent by local governments. In addition, 450 billion yen, or about $4.3 billion, will be spent on recovery from this summer's big earthquake and typhoons.
About 2.9 trillion yen, or $28 billion, is earmarked for increasing low interest loans for home-buying, one of the bright spots of the economy. The rest of the fiscal stimulus consists of incentives for businesses, like loans to help small- and medium-sized companies cope with the rise of the yen.
The new package is only about half the size of two previous programs, -- a 10.7 trillion yen stimulus announced in August 1992 and a 13.2 trillion yen package announced in April. At current exchange rates, those programs together are worth $228 billion.
One reason for the smaller package is that the Government cannot afford to increase spending much more without incurring a budget deficit. But another factor is a recognition that the centerpiece of the last two packages -- increased public works spending -- did not work as well as expected in reviving the economy.
"We've had two packages already," said Robert Alan Feldman, director of economic research for Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. "Why should this one work any better?"
Consumer spending is a far larger part of the economy than Government spending, and building roads and sewers has not led consumers to spend more.
Some analysts say scandals over bidding on construction projects have made local government officials reluctant to undertake new projects, even though the money is available. Finance Ministry officials, however, disputed this, saying public works money is being spent effectively.
Moreover, some economists say, part of Japan's economic troubles are structural, not cyclical, and cannot be cured by pump priming. Export markets for products like cars and VCR's are saturated, and Japan is becoming a high-cost manufacturer, in part because of the recent increase in the value of the yen.

HEADLINE: Trade Gap Narrowed 14% in July

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit shrank 14 percent in July, the Commerce Department said today. But while sluggish growth in the domestic economy curbed the appetite for imports, plunging deliveries of aircraft to foreign customers produced a decline in exports.
The overall narrowing of the deficit, to $10.34 billion, was less than half as large as the June surge, which pushed the deficit in merchandise to the highest level in more than five years and roiled world currency markets. 
 Analysts said it was now almost certain that the deficit would surpass $100 billion this year and result in the biggest imbalance since 1985.
"Most worrisome is what's going on with Europe," said Willard Workman, vice president for international affairs for the United States Chamber of Commerce. He noted that American sales in Europe have fallen 8 percent over the last year and that Canada has replaced the European Community as the biggest market for American exports.
The report showed that the American deficit with the European Community rose to $1.6 billion in July from $1.27 billion in June. The shift was offset by a reduction in the deficit with Canada to $638 million from $989 million.
 
A Lack of Competitiveness
 While much of Europe remains in recession, various analysts say the dwindling purchases of American products there reflect a lack of competitiveness as well as a lower point in the business cycle.
Today's report also showed that the nation's trade positions with Japan and Mexico -- two of the most politically sensitive relationships -- showed only modest change in July.
The deficit with Japan widened to $4.74 billion in July from $4.33 billion in June and $4.03 billion in July 1992, the department said.
The American surplus with Mexico fell to $108 million, from $128 million in June, bringing to 53 percent the cumulative drop for the first seven months of the year, compared with the 1992 period.
"This really reinforces our need for Nafta," contended Stephen L. Cooney Jr., trade specialist for the National Association of Manufacturers, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
He said the earlier boom in United States exports, aided by Mexican privatization and other economic liberalization, was now on the wane because of a pinch in the ability of Mexicans to buy American goods. "They've gone about as far as they can go without balance-of-payments problems," Mr. Cooney said.
The figures published today covered only goods. The United States has been running a surplus in banking, insurance, travel and other services that offsets roughly half of the deficit in merchandise.
 
Imports Off 4.6 Percent
 Over all, merchandise imports in July fell 4.6 percent, to $47.42 billion, with reductions in cars, trucks, parts and industrial supplies accounting for the largest portion. Imports of various electronics and other consumer goods also eased, however, raising early doubts about the strength of the holiday shopping season.
The reduced imports were more than enough to offset a 1.4 percent decline in exports, to $37.08 billion, and trim the trade deficit from the highest level since February 1988.
Sales of aircraft, big-ticket items that tend to be made in bunches, plummeted more than 60 percent in July, compared with July 1992, an exceptionally big swing. For the year to date, exports of aircraft have skidded more than 20 percent.
The deficit with China, which swelled by $275 million in July, was 26 percent higher in the first seven months of the year than in the comparable 1992 period. The combined deficits with China and Japan account for 72 percent of the total United States deficit so far this year. Deficits also widened in July with Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.
Reflecting the drop in aircraft sales, trade in advanced technology products showed an American surplus of only $915 million in July, less than one-third the level of many recent months.
On a three-month average, the overall trade gap now stands at $10.26 billion, up from $10.21 billion in June. It was the seventh consecutive monthly widening of the average.

HEADLINE: Stocks Are Mostly Flat as Dow Slips 2.80

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
A listlessness descended on the stock market yesterday, with mostly flat trading and light volume on the first full day of the Jewish holiday of Rosh ha-Shanah and a day ahead of "triple witching" day.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.80 points to close at 3,630.85. Volume was a modest 229.7 million shares, down from 298.3 million on Wednesday. 
Triple-witching days, the Fridays when three sets of options and futures contracts simultaneously expire each quarter, have historically brought wide swings to the market. Some Thursdays preceding triple-witching days have also seen volatility, but yesterday was sedate.
Analysts said the volatility of Wednesday's trading, when the market sank sharply and then recovered strongly, appeared to have been caused by traders leaving for Rosh ha-Shanah who were starting to limit their exposures in advance.
Broader market indicators were also flat yesterday. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 2.17 points, to 459.43. The American Stock Exchange composite index edged down 0.06, to 453.68, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 0.25, to 739.80.
Weakness in the bond market also seemed to be holding the Dow down. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell yesterday, as its yield rose to 6.03 percent, from 5.97 percent on Wednesday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.
 
Effects of Government Reports
 Two Government reports had little effect on the market: one, from the Labor Department, said the number of first-time unemployment claims filed rose slightly, by 2,000, last week, while the Federal Reserve said that industrial production rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August, the third straight monthly gain.
Most of the market's stories yesterday were not of sectors, but of individual stocks.
Whirlpool, the appliance maker, sank 3 1/2, to 57 1/4, when earnings estimates were cut by analysts after the company said earnings growth would not meet the rate of the first half.
Home Depot, the retailer, closed at 37 3/8, up 1 7/8, picking up some of the losses it suffered earlier this week.
Placer Dome, the gold mining company, closed at 19 1/8, up 1 3/4, on estimates that it has found 4.8 million ounces of gold at a drilling site in Venezuela.
Showboat, the operator of casinos and hotels, got a favorable analyst rating and closed at 19 3/4, up 4.
A.T.& T. lost 1 1/8, to 58 7/8, even though the company said it would seek an increase in long-distance rates to cover increasing costs.
The American depository receipts of London International Group, a condom and photoprocessing chemical maker, sank 4 1/4, to 11 3/8, on the announcement that its chief executive would retire and that it expected first-half earnings to be sharply lower than last year's.
Wellco Enterprises, a maker of combat boots, was up 5 7/8, to 29 1/2, after a gain of 5 3/8 the preceding day, on its declaration of a $6 cash dividend on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: An Idea Whose Time May Have Passed

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
In reaching a tentative agreement on Wednesday night that calls for lower wages for new workers, the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers are turning to a cost-saving measure that seems to have fallen out of favor recently among management and labor negotiators in other industries.
When it came to prominence in the airline and supermarket businesses a decade ago, the two-tier wage system was hailed by some companies as an innovation that would allow them to maintain or expand work forces more cheaply. It allowed unions to make concessions without hurting current members. 
 But the success of the strategy has often come down to this: is it healthy for management or labor if two employees performing the same work are paid sharply different salaries -- with no hope of ever closing the gap?
Faced with morale problems among the rank and file and a recession that has squeezed new hiring, some executives have decided the answer is no.
"Nobody seems to be terribly happy with it," said Al Bauman, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. "There have been a number of contracts where they have dropped the two tiers or eased them out."
And unions say that instead of seeking two-tier wage settlements, most companies are now more interested in finding ways to control health care costs for all employees, not just new ones. "The dynamic that is driving everything in negotiations is health care," said Greg Denier, a spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers union.
Under the tentative three-year deal reached late on Wednesday, new Ford workers will earn 70 percent of current workers' wages and will catch up within three years. But the new workers will also qualify for health benefits sooner than under the previous pact.
The old contract had a weaker version of two tiers, with workers receiving 85 percent of full pay for their first 18 months.
In agreeing to the new settlement, the U.A.W. is apparently trying to protect the pay and benefits of a large number of workers with substantial seniority. As car sales continue to rise and older workers retire, Ford is hoping to use the provision to cut the cost of bolstering its work force.
While saying that the number of two-tier accords seems to have declined, economists point out that it is difficult to collect data on such contracts because they differ widely. Agreements can require two tiers for pay, health care, pensions or vacations.
Whatever the specific provisions, some economists and most union leaders say workers resent two-tier systems. New ones feel underappreciated and their older counterparts often fear that they will be dismissed to make way for cheaper labor.
That was the case at the Hannaford Brothers Company, which runs more than 100 Shop-Rite and Shop 'n Save supermarkets in New York and New England. Hannaford, based in Scarborough, Me., negotiated two-tier contracts for its warehouse workers in the mid-1980's, but then dropped the provisions after tensions increased.
"Although it does save costs, the emotional and psychological toll on the everyday work force is hard to manage," said Walter Stilphen, director of labor relations at the company.
Two-tier contracts were embraced by airlines in the early 1980's after deregulation gave rise to nonunion carriers and intense competition. Companies like American Airlines told their unions that without such a structure there would be layoffs.
Under pressure to preserve pay and jobs, the unions caved in, though they often extracted provisions specifying that the new workers would eventually catch up.
"Most of the major airlines followed American's lead because it was a brilliant idea for the time," said Russell Thayer, a former senior executive at several carriers, including American, who is now a consultant at Airline Economics International in Washington. "But it's come back to haunt them."
He said that when the recession began carving through the industry, many carriers stopped hiring, preventing them from taking advantage of the lower salaries that are part of the two-tier system.
 
May Bbe 'Self-Defeating'
 Many supermarket companies also reasoned that two-tier contracts would help them cut costs because they have a relatively high worker turnover rate. But they too have discovered that in a recession, when many workers cling to their jobs, these provisions are often ineffective.
The American Stores Company, whose supermarket chains include Lucky, Acme and Jewel, had many two-tier contracts in the late 1970's and early 1980's but currently has none, said Meredith C. Anderson, a company spokeswoman.
She said American Stores, based in Salt Lake City, found that it was pushing the union for a concession that was producing few benefits for the company. "It's certainly an option that can be looked at, but in a bad economy, it may be somewhat self-defeating," she said.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS: Hotbeds for Start-Ups;
Where Is Opportunity Knocking the Loudest?

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
With big companies shedding workers left and right, where are America's new jobs going to come from? Try Charlotte, N.C., Huntsville, Ala., and Sunnyvale, Calif.
They are three of the winners in a new study of start-ups and job creation called "Entrepreneurial Hot Spots: The Best Places in America to Start and Grow a Company." 
 The study, published today, concludes that the nation's entrepreneurial hubs are determined far more by world-class universities, good roads and proximity to airports than by cheap labor or low tax rates. Yet subjective considerations also play a role, such as being seen as a "nice place to live" and having an entrepreneurial culture.
"The places that are doing well are competing by offering a high quality of life and skilled workers, not giveaways to companies," said David Birch, president of Cognetics Inc., an economic consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass.
Working with a data base of nine million companies, Mr. Birch and his staff ranked states, metropolitan areas and districts by the number of surviving start-ups and growth by young companies in recent years. The index measures growth both in percentage terms and absolute growth.
Most of the sales growth and job generation comes from a comparatively small number of fast-expanding companies -- Mr. Birch calls them "gazelles." In fact, he estimates that 70 percent of the growth comes from this 4 percent of the companies, which typically have between 20 and 200 workers and are expanding at more than 30 percent a year.
Among the 50 largest metropolitan areas, Charlotte comes in first, followed by Atlanta, Indianapolis, Nashville., and Raleigh-Durham, N.C. The least hospitable for entrepreneurs, the study says, are Hartford; Albany-Schenectady-Troy, N.Y.; New York; Boston, and Oklahoma City.
Huntsville heads the small metropolitan areas, followed by Honolulu; Las Vegas, Nev.; Madison, Wis., and Tallahassee, Fla.
Sunnyvale leads the ranking of so-called submarkets within the Government-designated large metropolitan areas. These submarkets are essentially big districts, each employing an average of 100,000 people. After Sunnyvale, the top-ranked districts are the area around Miami International Airport; Norcross, Ga.; Cumberland, Ga., and Morrisville, N.C.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Rises Slightly

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 16

 BODY:
Industrial production rose two-tenths of 1 percent in August, the Government said today. It was the third straight advance in an economic sector that had been struggling earlier in the year.
The Federal Reserve said the increase in output at the country's factories, mines and utilities followed advances of four-tenths of 1 percent in July and two-tenths of 1 percent in June. 
 Neither the production number nor another report showing a big drop in the trade deficit in July was considered a sign of robust economic activity, but some analysts were mildly encouraged.
"I'm getting the sense that the economy, which has been in a funk for the past three or four months, now is building up to stronger growth," said Mark Zandi, an economist with Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
In another report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits rose by 2,000 last week, to 324,000. It was the first increase in three weeks but was not considered a significant rise. The less volatile four-week moving average of claims was unchanged at 325,500, the lowest in four years.
In its industrial production report, the Federal Reserve said the production of business equipment and durable goods materials rose sharply.
 
Declines in Several Segments
 However, it said, the production of military and space equipment and of durable consumer goods declined further and the output of energy materials decreased because of the continuing strike in the coal industry. The report also said the production of automobiles and trucks fell 1.1 percent.
The country's industrial sector posted strong gains at the beginning of the year, following strong consumer demand in the final months of 1992.
But that demand slackened in early 1993 and manufacturers put the brakes on output. Production slipped from a five-tenths of 1 percent increase in February to just three-tenths of 1 percent in April, then fell to two-tenths of 1 percent in May.
Still, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday that businesses in July reported the biggest decline in inventories in more than two years, which could mean an increase in production as they try to restock their shelves and back lots.
And the Fed reported last week that a national survey showed that production was increasing in many areas. That followed a Labor Department report that both the factory workweek and overtime were rising in August.
The Fed's production report showed that the operating rate of industrial companies was 81.8 percent of capacity, unchanged from July and slightly above the 81.5 percent rate in both May and June. Capacity utilization is closely watched because a reading of more than 85 percent is considered to be inflationary.

HEADLINE: Suffolk Executive's Budget Seeks to Cut Property Taxes

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., Sept. 16

 BODY:
Relying on a sales-tax increase to yield at least $120 million next year, the Suffolk County Executive proposed a $1.56 billion budget today that would cut property taxes for most residents.
After years of deficits, fiscal crises and warnings of layoffs, the Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, also proposed hiring more than 400 new employees, including 340 police officers, and requested raises of 2.5 percent for elected officials, including himself. 
 Mr. Gaffney said that the sales-tax increase of one percentage point, which was to expire at year end until the county extended it by two years this summer, was central to stabilizing the county's finances. He estimated that Suffolk would finish 1993 with a $3.8 million surplus. The county had a deficit of $99.2 million as recently as 1991.
 
'Critical to Stable'
 "If the county government were a patient, its condition would be upgraded from critical to stable," Mr. Gaffney said. Without the sales-tax money, he added, "I would not be saying the county is off the critical list."
Mr. Gaffney's proposal reflected a swift turnaround of the county's fiscal fortunes. Last May he had sought a deficit financing package of up to $90 million through the sale of long-term bonds, to be paid off by sales tax revenues. The county Legislature rejected the package, and instead authorized a one-year note of $36.5 million. Officials said today the budget note had been repaid with current sales tax revenues.
Suffolk's 8.5 percent sales tax is the highest of any county in the state, and is matched only by Nassau County. During the last two years, as local officials throughout New York have struggled with sagging economies and stiff resistance to property-tax increases, 13 of the state's 62 counties have imposed higher sales taxes.
"So many places were maxed out on property taxes, they had nowhere else to go," said Karl E. Felsen, a spokesman for the State Department of Taxation and Finance in Albany.
Critics say the sales-tax increases spare payers of property taxes but place an unfair burden on the poor. But county officials reply that higher sales taxes meet far less organized resistance than property-tax increases.
 
Cuts Are Welcomed
 Mr. Gaffney said the proposed budget for 1994 assumed a 3.8 percent increase in sales-tax revenues next year. Of the 8.5 percent total tax, the county share is 4.25 percentage points.
He said any surplus would be used to pay for refinancing of long-term county debt at lower interest rates.
Donald R. Blydenburgh, a Smithtown Republican and the presiding officer of the county Legislature, applauded the proposed property tax cuts and predicted the spending plan would be well received in the Legislature, where Republicans and Conservatives hold a majority. Hearings on the budget are scheduled next month.
Democratic members had opposed extending the higher sales tax because, they said, Mr. Gaffney had failed to reduce spending enough.
By the county's reckoning, the average taxpayer in four of the county's five western towns would enjoy a property tax cut of $44.80 next year and, in the five eastern towns, $87.94. County taxes account for about one-fifth of total property taxes for most Suffolk residents.
In the Town of Brookhaven, property taxes would increase by $131.76 because of the loss of the $5.5 billion Shoreham nuclear power plant from assessment rolls. Under a settlement between Gov.Mario M. Cuomo and the Long Island Lighting Company, the plant was sold to the state for decommissioning.
 
Adding Police Officers
 Mr. Gaffney said that if 340 new police officers were hired, the county force would number 2,629, the highest since 1983. He said the new officers would allow resumption of community-oriented policing, which had been hobbled by budget constraints. The budget proposes a pilot program of competitive bidding for county bus routes and leasing of county cars. Mr. Gaffney said the leasing plan would save the county up to $6 million.
Mr. Gaffney said he would make "no apologies" for heightened dependence on sales taxes. "It's a better way to do it than increasing property taxes," he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Declines Against Yen On Doubts Over Japan's Plan

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the yen yesterday on doubts that a new Japanese economic package would be enough to curb that country's huge trade surplus with the United States.
But the dollar rallied against the German mark, recovering from a 16-week low against the currency, after a large purchase of dollars led to orders to sell marks, dealers said. 
 The dollar began sliding against the yen during Far East trading after unnamed American officials reportedly said that Japan's economic stimulus package fell short of what was needed to pare the trade surplus. Clinton Administration officials have urged Japan to cut taxes and take other measures to stimulate its lagging economy and help increase demand for American exports.
But the stimulus package did not include tax cuts. United States Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen later called the package a "step in the right direction" but said the United States was hoping for more.
 
Renewed Trade Tensions
His comments raised fears that the White House would renew suggestions that it favored a stronger yen as a means of attacking the huge United States-Japan trade gap.
"The market view is that if the U.S. is not appeased by the plan, which seems to be the case, then it will resume its war of words" on the dollar's exchange-rate against the yen, said the head of foreign exchange at an American investment bank in London.
The dollar received little help from a Commerce Department report showing that the trade gap with Japan widened to $4.74 billion in July, its largest level since April.
But talk of a large purchase of dollars for marks and sentiment among some dealers that the American currency was undervalued against the German currency helped the dollar to recover.
The dollar surged to 1.6025 marks in late New York trading, from 1.5955 on Wednesday. Earlier in London, the dollar climbed to 1.6065 marks, from 1.5903 marks Wednesday.
The dollar dropped to 104.15 yen in late New York trading, from 106.00 yen Wednesday. In late Tokyo trading on yesterday, the dollar was quoted at 104.62 yen. Tokyo markets were closed for a national holiday on Wednesday.
The British pound slipped to $1.5330 in New York from $1.5495. In London, it fell to $1.5320 from $1.5515.

HEADLINE: Now Shake Hands With Vietnam

 BODY:
Sooner or later some American President will find the courage to end Washington's now-pointless vendetta against Communist Vietnam. That President might as well be Bill Clinton and the time might as well be now.
The public debate on U.S. Vietnam policy focuses on Hanoi's cooperation in locating the remains of servicemen listed as missing in action since the Vietnam War. But the biggest obstacle to normal diplomatic and economic relations is America's wounded national pride and White House fears of a ferocious backlash. 
 This week President Clinton took the latest in a series of modest steps meant to reward increased Vietnamese cooperation in the search for M.I.A.'s.
George Bush began the process last year by letting U.S. companies prospect for future business in Vietnam. Then Mr. Clinton dropped longstanding American objections to loans for Vietnam from international development banks. He also stationed American diplomats in Vietnam for the first time since the war's end. On Monday the Administration announced that U.S. companies could bid for business financed by the development loans.
These steps are all welcome, but there's no good reason not to go all the way.
Controversial documents recently unearthed from Soviet archives suggest that Hanoi may have understated the number of prisoners it held 20 years ago. But despite the claims of Senator Robert Smith of New Hampshire and others, there's no persuasive evidence that any Americans are still being held. Meanwhile, Clinton Administration officials report that Vietnam's Government is actively cooperating in the search for M.I.A. remains.
Even if Americans were being held captive, the chances of discovering them could only be improved by an increased U.S. diplomatic and business presence in Vietnam. If convincing new evidence were found, American sanctions could be reimposed, and allies could be asked to join in.
The embargo did apply effective pressure on Vietnam in the 1980's, when other countries also restricted trade and investment to protest Hanoi's occupation of Cambodia. But most countries dropped their restrictions when Vietnam withdrew its troops and cooperated with efforts to establish an elected Cambodian government.
Now America's European allies, along with the main non-Communist governments of Asia, are forging new links with Hanoi, sustaining its pro-market reforms and encouraging its peaceful integration into the Asia-Pacific region. With the rest of the world investing and trading in Vietnam, the U.S. embargo has little effect. In the small Vietnamese market, America's absent companies are readily replaced.
America's interest in Vietnam lies in successful reform and regional integration, not endless refighting of the domestic politics of the Vietnam War. There may never be a politically smart time to take the plunge. But the right time is now.

HEADLINE: Mr. Rohatyn and a City's Debt

 BODY:
The chairman of New York City's Municipal Assistance Corporation, Felix Rohatyn, has held that unsalaried post for nearly two decades, but his real influence goes well beyond the formal title. Using his position as a platform, the outspoken investment banker created a broad and unusual role for himself as the city's fiscal conscience. Now that Mr. Rohatyn has resigned, New Yorkers can only hope that circumstances and luck will conspire to bring them another Rohatyn, a shrewd private citizen with enough patience and guile to prod and guide political insiders.
Mr. Rohatyn came on the scene with the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, when Gov. Hugh Carey enlisted him to help save New York City from bankruptcy. That accomplished, Mr. Rohatyn turned himself into New York's pessimistic truth-teller. He could overdo it -- hence his familiar "Cassandra" label. He could anger other players in the city's fiscal drama -- especially labor leaders who resented his hard-edged advice. He could act like a rival to the mayor, bent on making policy for the city. He could fuss over his press coverage. 
 But Mr. Rohatyn also did what nobody else could. He cast a dry eye on his city's fiscal shenanigans and told everyone what he saw. As an unpaid, private businessman, he had the credibility to cry foul when elected officials let the city live beyond its means. They haven't always listened: the city budget is still structurally unbalanced, which means New York continues to burden the future by borrowing now and planning to pay later. But if elected officials sometimes refused to heed Mr. Rohatyn's counsel, they always heard it. So did Wall Street, the credit markets and the public.
The public also benefited in other ways. After helping to create the Municipal Assistance Corporation to borrow for the city in 1975, he turned it into a healthy money-maker. The M.A.C. generated $3.5 billion, which he directed toward education, mass transit and economic development.
Who elected Rohatyn? former Mayor Edward Koch used to ask. Nobody. Crisis invented him and he took care of the rest. New York City is in his debt.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
The Crux of the Deal

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
It was not altruism or a sudden access of affection for each other that moved Israel and the P.L.O. to the ceremony on the White House lawn. It was self-interest: a realization that making peace with this enemy was better than the looming alternatives.
And self-interest is the key to making the agreement work. It is ingeniously built into the deal, giving each party incentives to do what the other wants. 
 Yasir Arafat and his colleagues have compelling reasons to prevent terrorism or disorder in the small areas they will initially govern. They know that their chance of expanding self-rule in the West Bank -- and eventually of establishing a Palestinian state -- depend on their demonstrating to Israel that they can be a safe and reliable neighbor.
For its part, Israel's Government has every incentive to help the P.L.O. succeed in Gaza and Jericho. Calm and improving societies there would be a vital political justification for the gamble Prime Minister Rabin and his colleagues took.
The United States and other Western countries have their own self-interested reasons for wanting to help the P.L.O. succeed in the interim self-rule plan. Success would be a key to reducing tensions in the entire Middle East, and reducing the threat of the two radical states that have denounced this agreement: Iran and Iraq.
The help that the Palestinians need from the friendly world is economic. The P.L.O. leadership must produce improvements in the quality of life for Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho to have their support.
Gaza is one of the most depressing places on earth: 800,000 people, most of them crowded into miserable refugee camps with no sewage systems. There are virtually no jobs in the Gaza Strip itself; men cross daily into Israel, when they can, for mostly physical labor.
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States also have strong reasons to help the struggling Palestinian entity. It is not a matter of Arab brotherhood; the gulf rulers have no love for the P.L.O. It is their profound interest in regional stability.
Saudi Arabia has a card of particular importance to play. That is to end the Arab boycott of Israel. Saudis are reluctant to lead. When pressed on this subject, they say the boycott is not much enforced now anyway. But it has great symbolic significance. Ending it would go far toward lifting the sense of isolation that oppresses Israelis, and would give Mr. Rabin more political space to proceed.
Moreover, ending the boycott would help the West Bank. Some Arab countries now bar the meager goods Palestinians try to export from there, on the asserted ground that Israel is involved.
The economic needs of the West Bank and Gaza are substantial but not daunting. And a good deal of planning has already been done. The world bank has its ideas ready. A Harvard University team published detailed proposals in June, prepared with the intense and friendly participation of Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian economists.
That leads to a point about the dramatic events of the last two weeks. In the Israeli-P.L.O. rapprochement, officials followed way behind what private individuals have done in recent years. Scholars and others from the two sides have been meeting with increasing frequency. Finally one of those meetings, in Norway, led to the official contacts that produced the agreement.
Here a word must be said for those on both sides who for years -- for a generation -- argued fruitlessly for peace. Issam Sartawi and Said Hammami of the P.L.O. were assassinated by Arab extremists for their efforts. Lova Eliav of Israel's Labor Party spent years in the political wilderness. American Jews who made contact with the P.L.O. were denounced as traitors.
They were right. If their views had been heeded long ago, much misery and death would have been avoided.
But even this late there are some reasons for optimism: reasons rooted in self-interest. The president of the American Jewish Congress, Robert Lifton, reports after a visit to Israel that many of his conservative business friends there, who voted for the Likud, now talk excitedly about the economic potential of peace. That potential must be for both Israelis and Palestinians.

HEADLINE: Mexico Takes Giant Steps Toward a New Era;
Things to Come?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am secretary general of a union of Mexicans and Americans who work at the Mexican-American Cultural Relations Institute (Instituto Mexicano Norteamericano de Relaciones
Culturales), founded by Presidents Manuel Avila Camacho and Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1944. Here, generations of Mexicans and Americans have studied English and Spanish. 
 One would think that on the threshold of a free trade agreement among the nations of North America, the institute would be flourishing. This is not the case. On Aug. 12, it closed its doors without notice for arbitrary and unknown reasons, locking out more than 4,000 students and nearly 100 teachers and staff members.
We suspect that this sudden decision is related to a hidden agenda of the free trade agreement and to the current situation in Mexico.
The teachers and administrative and maintenance personnel of the institute are fully aware that Mexican labor laws are designed to protect our jobs. However, we also realize that big business interests in the United States and Mexico are trying to get around the laws that protect us.
For many years the institute has been controlled by a board made up of a small group of powerful Mexicans and Americans whose business interests lie in Mexico. They know full well what the future holds for Mexican and American workers and their labor laws.
Our union is well aware that one of the reasons the free trade agreement is attractive to American businesses is the low salaries paid in Mexico. We also know that the only defense Mexican workers have is their system of labor laws. What's happening to our institute is an example of how these labor laws can be pushed aside, allowing business free reign to disregard worker rights. The process is simple: shut down the place of employment without warning.
Beginning some years ago the institute began to dismantle departments. Gradually, business fronts were formed. We suspect these have functioned as holding companies to place profits out of reach, thereby evading taxes and diverting funds generated by international sales of teaching materials. These holding companies intend to reopen the institute under another name after doing away with our union. Though they are registered as nonprofit organizations, they have bank accounts in the United States, enabling them to control the segments of what was once the institute.
At the most recent meeting before Mexican Government labor authorities, the institute's governing body refused to reopen our place of employment and offered us 19.5 percent of the severance pay Mexican labor law stipulates. We have rejected this offer as unfair to our members, who have dedicated as much as 35 years of service to the institute. Is this, we ask, a foretaste of the trade agreement?

Social Security: Better to Pass at Age 62 to Collect More at 65?

BYLINE: By Andree Brooks

 BODY:
Thousands of people each year must decide whether to start collecting Social Security benefits at age 62 or to wait until 65 or even later.
 Some people, of course, need the money desperately. But others are still working, if only part time, or drawing on other resources. They have to weigh the advantages of having a little more now or much more later. 

 People can start collecting anytime after they turn 62. But by beginning then, their monthly checks will be 20 percent smaller -- forever -- than if they had waited until 65. And if they begin at age 65, their checks will be 20 percent smaller than if they had waited until 70. For each year of delay, the monthly payment rises 4 to 8 percent.
 For example, someone turning 65 this year who is eligible to receive $800 a month would have gotten only $640 by starting at age 62. If he waits until 70, he could increase his monthly check to $960, said Philip Gambino, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration. These figures do not include the cost-of-living adjustments made regularly by the agency.
 Last year, more people decided to start collecting benefits at age 62 than at any other age: 48 percent of men and 57 percent of women, according to the agency.
 Of course, many people who wait would not qualify for benefits anyway because they are still working and earning substantial income, Mr. Gambino said.
 Other people are retired but have alternative income -- say, a private pension or interest on investments. Although this other money may not be so great as to make them ineligible for benefits, it fills their current needs, said Laurel Beedon, senior economic analyst for the Public Policy Institute of the American Association of Retired Persons.
 Recognizing that life spans are increasing, these people may wish to keep a higher level of Social Security income in reserve for their later years when other resources have been partly or completely depleted, Ms. Beedon said. Someone enjoying good health, collecting other income and anticipating a long life might choose this approach.
 Another school of thought holds that even if you don't need the cash right away, you should start collecting as soon as possible and invest the money. The discretionary income could be far more valuable today than tomorrow.
 A monthly payment of $640 would generate an investment pool of $7,680 a year (assuming it is not subject to income tax) or $23,040 from age 62 to 65. "If you're good at investing, it could work," Ms. Beedon said.
 The choice, ultimately, depends on individual circumstances. Ask your local Social Security office for an estimate of your benefits or call 800 772-1213 for a referral.

HEADLINE: Key to Israel-P.L.O. Pact Is Seen in Economic Ties

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN with CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Israeli political leaders have talked this last week of lowering trade barriers and building new roads to create what Foreign Minister Shimon Peres called "a triangle of political triumph and economic prosperity" among Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians.
But if the transition to Palestinian self-government is to succeed, the economy of the occupied territories will have to remain umbilically tied to Israel for at least the next few years, even if it means keeping neighboring Jordan on the sidelines, Israeli and Palestinian economists say. 
 Economists and business leaders here caution that the key to success for the new deal struck by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization lies in rapid economic progress in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. People there will have to see their daily lives improve almost right away, they say.
And to do that, they add, there is no alternative but to maintain and even strengthen the already considerable economic links between the territories and Israel. These ties might be expected to grow anyway, although economists say that nationalist politics among Palestinians could force their leaders into trying to put up barriers with Israel that may not make economic sense.
 
A Pall Over Jordan
 Economists see the close links between Israel and the Palestinians persisting through the next five years of planned self-rule and probably beyond, when the Palestinians may have achieved their hoped-for independent state. This prospect of close Israeli-Palestinian cooperation has cast a pall over Jordan, which fears that it will become the odd man out.
Jordanian officials worry that Israel will continue to enforce a trade embargo that keeps Jordanian products out of the West Bank and Gaza, depriving the hard-pressed kingdom of potential revenues estimated at $300 million a year. In addition, Government planners in Amman view the new Palestinian "entity" that is being born as a possible drain on their own economy, attracting large amounts of foreign aid and investment, perhaps including huge cash flows from Palestinians in Jordan and elsewhere.
Their concerns were not eased by President Clinton's disclosure in a phone conversation with King Hussein on Wednesday that the United States would release $30 million in 1993 aid to Amman that had been frozen, now that Jordan and Israel have signed a negotiating agenda for their part of the Middle East peace talks.
Rather, the Jordanians watch in despair as the United States and Europe talk about raising hundreds of millions of dollars for the Palestinians, and never mention Jordan, which they say is still paying for its pro-Iraq sympathies during the Persian Gulf war.
 
'Wretched Gulf War'
 "I am excluded from the discussion, and have been since that wretched gulf war," said Crown Prince Hassan, heir to the throne. "But you can't continue to ignore us at the same time you expect us to participate."
But in Israel and the territories, economists and business leaders argue that the realities of the last quarter of a century cannot be made to disappear with a finger snap. The economic fate of Gaza and the West Bank has been tied to Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. Those links will have to be maintained and perhaps even thickened, they say, if Palestinians are to see immediate economic benefits that may go far to determine whether the new peace plan succeeds or fails.
Day to day, these experts assert, it means that tens of thousands of Palestinians from the territories must be allowed into Israel to work, even though some Israelis may raise security objections. And cheap Palestinian agricultural products and textiles must have access to markets in Israel, even though Israeli farmers and factory owners are sure to protest a lowering of protectionist barriers that have shielded them from competition.
 
'Like Siamese Twins'
 "To me, the two economies are like Siamese twins," said Danny Gillerman, president of the Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce. "If you separate them, one of them will die, and it is obvious that that one will be the Palestinian economy."
A continuing Israeli refrain to the Palestinians goes like this: Our $60 billion-a-year economy dwarfs yours of $3 billion, about one-third of which depends on income earned in Israel. In short, you need us more than we need you, for at the start you will not have the wherewithal to export products on your own to Europe and beyond. And don't expect much help from Arab countries in terms of jobs and markets, including Jordan, which has a gross national product of only $3.7 billion a year, on a per-capita basis smaller than even that of impoverished Gaza.
"For growth, the Palestinians must have open borders with Israel," said Prof. Haim Ben-Shahar, an economics consultant who supervised a Finance Ministry study on the subject that is likely to become Government policy. "They can compete with Israel in areas like agriculture, textiles and plastics because of cheap labor. That advantage disappears for them if they want to market their goods in Jordan."
In the territories, widespread mistrust of Israel remains, a concern that the Israelis' real goal is to perpetuate through relative economic power the dominance that they have maintained by military force since capturing Gaza and the West Bank in 1967.
Nonetheless, Palestinian economists agree with their Israeli counterparts that the establishment of Palestinian self-rule cannot be accompanied by an economic parting of the ways.
"Linkage in a state of mutual dependency is practically inevitable," said Prof. Hisham Awartani, an economics professor at An Najah University in the West Bank city of Nablus. But results must come quickly, he added.
 
How Much Money Is Needed?
 In the last few weeks, as the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization moved startlingly from implausible rumor to signed reality, considerable attention has been focused on how many billions of dollars will have to be poured -- and from where -- into the territories to meet basic needs like water, housing, health care and sewers.
Housing is especially critical in overcrowded Gaza, a narrow coastal strip with some 800,000 residents, including 350,000 who are squeezed into eight main refugee camps.
The camps have existed for decades, held forth by Palestinians and Arab states as living symbols of their loss of land to Israel when it came into being in 1948. But now that the P.L.O. recognizes Israel, it in effect has acknowledged that those refugees and their children and grandchildren are in Gaza to stay, and therefore the camps lose their significance.
 
Thousands of Apartments
 This means tearing down the camps and building tens of thousands of new apartments, and that will be expensive -- not to mention the cost of other basic elements of infrastructure.
A World Bank report estimates that, in all, $3 billion will be needed over the next eight years for both Gaza and the West Bank. Far more ambitious is a P.L.O. plan that calls for an infusion of $11.6 billion by the year 2000, with $2.5 billion said to be needed right away to invigorate the anemic Palestinian economy.
President Clinton has already begun rattling the cup in front of probable donors like Western Europe, Japan and oil-rich Arab countries to put together an emergency fund of $590 million for start-up costs. Thus far, commitments have been scarce, although Scandinavian countries pledge $140 million in aid over the next four years and the European Community is considering a five-year package of loans and grants worth $600 million.
In the meantime, Jordan worries not only that it will see precious little of this aid but also that Palestinian money will move in a rush from the kingdom to the territories. The Government in Amman is considering restrictions on the amounts that depositors may withdraw from Jordanian banks. And officials there caution that a deterioration in living standards could have dire consequences for a country where unemployment is already at 25 percent and one-third of the 4.1 million people fall below the official poverty line.
In Israel and the territories, economists say that while the aid is obviously needed, it is hardly the sole solution. Professor Awartani and others also question the capacity of the territories -- with a gross national product of only about $1,800 per capita, compared with nearly $11,000 per capita in Israel -- to absorb and administer the bundles of sudden cash being discussed.
"I'm not saying that money isn't important or that infrastructure isn't important," insisted Ezra Sadan, an Israeli economist and former senior official in the finance and agriculture ministries. "But access to markets is the key to the future."
The Finance Ministry draft report prepared by Professor Ben-Shahar says that there should be a free trade zone comprised of Israel and the territories, with no customs posts. This would not apply to Jordan, though, and the Jordanians do not like it.
The draft report also says that Palestinian laborers should be able to work in Israel.
 
Attacks on Israelis
 Left unclear was how many Palestinian workers should be permitted to enter Israel, a sensitive point here because it is linked to another pivotal issue: security.
After a wave of lethal attacks on Israelis in March, Israel closed off the territories, allowing in Palestinians only by special permit. The immediate effect was to cut off 100,000 or more Arab construction and farm workers from their only sources of livelihood.
Little by little, the travel ban has been eased, to a point that about 50,000 Palestinians now commute on weekdays to jobs in Israel. The Finance Ministry report says that one option is to double that figure, although it adds that a reduction is also possible. Either way, its point is that Palestinians must be allowed to work inside Israel.
Left unsaid is what would happen if the result of this free movement is another wave of violence.
"We are living in the Middle East," said Samir Huleileh, a Palestinian economist, "where politics determines most things, and not necessarily economics."

HEADLINE: West Is Welcoming Reformer's Return in Moscow

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Western diplomats and economists today welcomed former Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar's return to government as a desperately needed bolstering of support for market-oriented policies in the badly divided administration.
President Boris N. Yeltsin acted under considerable pressure from the United States and international lending institutions like the International Monetary Fund, the diplomats said. Some wondered whether Mr. Yeltsin was once more responding to a crisis by an essentially symbolic gesture. 
 "But I can't imagine that anyone in the West would be unhappy that Gaidar is back," a senior diplomat said. "There are real problems to be solved, and Gaidar at least can understand them."
The diplomats also expressed relief that the central-planning minded Economics Minister, Oleg I. Lobov, an old Yeltsin friend, is being moved aside. "If Yeltsin had sided with Lobov, it would have been a big step back from Russia's break with Communism," a diplomat said.
Inflation surged to 29 percent in August, up from about 20 percent in June and July, partly because of seasonal agricultural credits. With Mr. Yeltsin seemingly unable to decide on a clear course, the Finance Minister, Boris G. Fyodorov, had been widely said to be planning to resign.
 
Western Aid in Balance
 That would have been an enormous symbolic blow and would have caused concern in the West, which is trying to justify giving Russia more than $40 billion in loans, grants and debt relief this year alone. Aides to Mr. Fyodorov said today that he would stay on.
Russian officials said today that the Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, also favored the return of Mr. Gaidar. Mr. Chernomyrdin, an industrialist, is said to understand the inflationary danger of too high a budget deficit, and he was seeking a more respected buffer in the Government against demands from enterprises and Parliament for extra spending. Mr. Chernomyrdin said today that Mr. Gaidar would be part of a team and would have to keep "a single basic line."
Mr. Gaidar, who was dropped as acting Prime Minister by Mr. Yeltsin in December in the face of parliamentary opposition, will become one of three First Deputy Prime Ministers, Mr. Yeltsin said Thursday. But his friends say he will be in charge of economic policy or would not have agreed to return.
The Russian officials stressed that Mr. Lobov would be moved out of Government to an advisory post in Mr. Yeltsin's office. Mr. Lobov has been pushing since May for much more state regulation and the empowerment of his ministry as the chief planning center for the economy.
His proposals have been resisted by the small core of reformers that remain in the Cabinet, especially Mr. Fyodorov, and the Privatization Minister, Anatoly B. Chubais. But even Western diplomats who try to see the bright side of the Russian situation acknowledged that Mr. Lobov's feud with Mr. Fyodorov had created a paralysis in the Government and symbolized the split between Soviet-style central planners and Gaidar-style reformers.
"A lot of work is simply not being done inside the Government, and a lot of issues have been unresolved," a diplomat said. "It's been a form of paralysis."
 
I.M.F. Team in Moscow
 An important team from the International Monetary Fund is in Moscow now, deciding whether to recommend the release of $1.5 billion more in transitional funds to Russia even under a relaxed set of conditions. Fund officials in Washington said they had expected a sharply negative report before the announcement of Mr. Gaidar's return.
Senior United States officials, however, pushing the Fund to be as understanding as possible with Russia, said the new money was still a possibility before the end of the year. "We're trying to create a stepladder of reform and economic stabilization," an official said, instead of "erecting a wall" of impossible conditions.
The next few weeks would be crucial, the senior official said, amidst higher inflation than many hoped and "disturbing signs of further credit growth." Russia's most important task was to limit its budget deficit, he said. Almost as important was to control new credits from the Central Bank. The West also wants significant progress in structural reform, he said, and a reduction of export controls, to enable Russia to earn more hard currency.
But the officials said Russia would not meet an Oct. 1 deadline for a more formal standby agreement with the Fund. That failure would allow Western nations in the so-called Paris Club of creditors to pull back from an agreement to reschedule Russia's $70 billion to $80 billion of debt, most of it inherited from the Soviet Union.
In fact, the diplomats said, creditors would gain little by increasing Russia's debt and making it impossible for Moscow to pay. Moscow is already slow at paying rescheduled debt and American agricultural loans, for instance.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. Reviewing Cable TV Rates As Rollbacks Turn Into Increases

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Six months after the Federal Communications Commission promised cable television customers $1 billion in annual rate rollbacks, the agency conceded today that cable rates seem to be rising, as many consumers have argued.
"It's obvious there's a problem, but we'll have to find out the extent of it," said James H. Quello, the acting chairman of the commission. Amid a torrent of complaints from angry consumers and members of Congress, the F.C.C. announced that it would start a detailed survey of the prices charged by the 25 biggest cable companies. 
 The F.C.C. is giving the companies just two weeks to respond, and Mr. Quello acknowledged that the results might force his agency to rewrite the foot-high stack of rules it just finished painstakingly drawing up.
The announcement amounts to a big embarrassment for F.C.C. officials, who until now strongly denied there was any problem. Indeed, in recent weeks Mr. Quello and other officials have issued several blunt statements insisting that any price increases for some customers were more than offset by declines for others.
The new rate regulations, which took effect on Sept. 1, were issued in response to legislation Congress passed last October to rein in price increases and force cable companies to improve their service. Since the cable television industry was deregulated in 1986, cable prices had been climbing at more than twice the rate of inflation -- in part because all but a handful of systems enjoy monopoly franchises.
The new rules set up a complicated system of "benchmark" prices, and F.C.C. officials had predicted that they would force rate reductions of more than 10 percent for about two-thirds of all cable systems.
But it has not necessarily worked that way, as consumers have been discovering in the last few weeks. Virtually reversing what the F.C.C. had intended in writing the new rules, prices for basic and expanded services have gone up at many companies, while the costs of options like additional outlets have gone down.
In New York City, for example, Time Warner Cable shaved the price of its most basic package by 24 cents a month, to $14.71, while increasing the additional charge for its expanded service by 87 cents, to $8.87, according to the city's Department of Telecommunications and Energy. The combined total monthly rate increased to $23.58 from $22.95.
As consumers started to receive the new price lists by mail, they started flooding members of Congress with complaints. Aides to Representative Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who led the House fight to reregulate cable, said they had received 50 to 75 calls a day from consumers in the last few weeks. Even before today's F.C.C. announcement, Mr. Markey had scheduled a hearing on the matter for Sept. 28.
 
 
Legislators Urged a Review
 Mr. Markey and Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, have been circulating a "Dear Colleague" letter in the House demanding that the F.C.C. revisit its rules. Nearly 100 lawmakers have signed the letter so far.
Congressional staff members said the F.C.C.'s new rate survey was, if anything, overdue. "What this survey shows is that the F.C.C. is at least having second thoughts that this is not working out the way they thought it would," said Gerry Waldron, senior counsel to the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Telecommunications. "The survey itself will tell us the extent of the problem."
Mr. Quello recently got his own taste of consumer anger. As a guest on a call-in radio program in Detroit this month, he faced a barrage of complaints from residents upset about cable prices.
Officials of Time Warner, the nation's second-biggest cable operator, after Tele-Communications Inc., said they would cooperate with the F.C.C.'s inquiry.
"We think it is perfectly appropriate for the F.C.C. to gather information about how we are complying with the statute, and we will pledge our full cooperation," said Tim Boggs, a lobbyist for the company in Washington.
But it may be hard to determine where rates really stand for the nation's customers. For one thing, the regulations play out differently for each of the nation's 11,000 cable franchises, and the customers of one system may get rate cuts while prices go up for those in an adjacent town.
 
 
A Complicated Approach
 Public anger over cable prices had led Congress to pass the cable bill last year over President George Bush's veto. The law set out a complicated approach to lowering prices. The F.C.C was directed to issue and enforce guidelines that would lead cable operators to charge rates comparable with those in the handful of competitive markets.
To do this, the F.C.C. came up with a staggering collection of benchmark prices, which varied depending on the number of channels offered and the number of customers.
But these benchmarks were total prices for all of the services the companies could offer. As a result, many companies found they could stay within the guidelines by dropping their highest prices for the fanciest level of service while raising the charges for more basic service.
The result has been confusion.
In general, the biggest reductions are going to people who subscribe to the most lavish monthly packages, have more than one cable outlet in the home and rent remote-control devices. Figuring out the net result requires calculating how many customers fall into these rough categories.
Tele-Communications told financial analysts this summer that rate regulation would cost it about $160 million, or 4 percent of its total revenue. Time Warner has said it will give up from $90 million to $100 million.
 Regardless of the new survey's findings, there is a growing consensus that the rules have had at least one unintended result: they seem to be helping relatively affluent people who buy fancy service while hurting the people who buy bare-bones packages, who are likely to be poorer.
Some Congressional critics say regulators may have misfired in their basic calculations.
"The F.C.C. set the benchmark prices too high," Representative Shays said in an interview. "Its own analysis showed that cable systems that face effective competition have prices that are 30 percent lower than those that don't, but the benchmark prices are only 10 percent lower."
Since the rules were adopted, agency officials have acknowledged this point. But they say they had no choice, because the law passed by Congress includes a peculiar definition of "effective competition" that includes cable systems with very low market penetration and systems owned by municipalities.

HEADLINE: Premium Limits In Health Plan Draw Criticism

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office warned today that one of the most important elements of President Clinton's health plan, Federal limits on private health insurance premiums, could harm consumers by forcing a reduction in valuable medical care and restricting access to new medical technology.
More than any other factor, it is the soaring cost that has ignited public interest in efforts to overhaul the nation's medical system. Mr. Clinton asserts that his proposal would control costs primarily by encouraging competition in the health care market. 
 But to guarantee savings, his plan calls for Federal regulation of private health insurance premiums and a national limit on overall health spending, public and private.
 
'Difficult to Design'
 In its report, the Congressional Budget Office said Federal regulation of insurance premiums "could be difficult to design and costly to put in place."
"Experience with price controls in other sectors demonstrates just how difficult it is to anticipate all of the possible market responses to controls and take them into account in developing enforcement mechanisms," the report said.
An Administration official, asked about the report, said, "It is not relevant to the Clinton plan because our proposal includes many safeguards to ameliorate the problems described by C.B.O."
The report was requested by Representative Fortney H. (Pete) Stark, the California Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. He asked for the study in December, before Mr. Clinton's proposal crystallized. Several members of Congress, including Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, had already endorsed the idea of regulating premiums.
The questions raised today by the Congressional Budget Office echo the concerns voiced by many economists. They say the Government lacks the expertise to set an overall budget for health care, a rapidly changing industry that accounts for a seventh of the nation's economy.
The Congressional Budget Office said it was not analyzing any specific legislative proposal but was assessing the feasibility of regulating premiums in general.
Moreover, the official, who spoke on the condition that he not be named, said the President's proposal for Government regulation of insurance premiums "is not difficult to enforce." Health plans that charge more than the amount allowed by the Government would have to pay a special assessment, he said.
But in an interview, Mr. Stark said: "I do not believe premium controls will work. If they did work, they might cause problems for patients and could adversely affect the quality of care."
Bill Gradison, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, said he, too, doubted that Federal regulation of premiums would work. "I don't think it would be an effective way to hold down health costs," he said. "It's like bombing at 35,000 feet. You don't know whether you're going to hit anything, and you don't know whether it will be friend or foe."
 
Series of Reports
 The report was prepared by economists and health policy analysts at the Congressional Budget Office, an influential, nonpartisan arm of Congress. It is one of a series of reports in which the agency will analyze proposals, by the President and members of Congress, to control health costs and guarantee care for all Americans.
Mr. Clinton will present his proposal in a speech to Congress on Wednesday. White House officials say he has decided not to impose direct price controls on doctors, hospitals, drug companies and other health care providers.
Instead, he will propose Government regulation of insurance premiums, on the theory that insurers will crack down on waste and fraud and limit payments to doctors and hospitals.
If the cost-control efforts of insurance companies reduce unnecessary or inappropriate care, "consumers generally would be better off," the Congressional Budget Office said.
"But," it said, "efforts to reduce unnecessary care would almost certainly have the effect of eliminating some useful services; thus, some individuals might be worse off even if consumers on the whole were made better off."
If limits on premiums are set too low, the study said, insurers and providers may react by restricting access to medical care and to costly new medical technology.
President Clinton's proposal relies on health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care, which seek to control costs through closely supervising doctors and directing patients to selected physicians.
The Congressional Budget Office said that when insurers react to limits on insurance premiums by expanding the use of managed care they may achieve a "one-time reduction in health care costs but may not reduce the rate of growth in health spending over the long run."
 
Premiums' Path
 Under Mr. Clinton's proposal, most people in a particular area would pay the same premium, regardless of their medical problems. The payments would be sent to health insurance purchasing groups, or regional alliances, which would sign contracts with health plans, composed of doctors, hospitals, clinics and insurance companies.
White House documents say that payments to health plans would be adjusted to reflect factors like "age, gender, health status and services to disadvantaged populations."
For example, a health plan would receive more money for managing the care of a person with AIDS than for a young, healthy worker. But the Congressional Budget Office said there was no reliable method of calculating premiums in advance, to take account of the risks presented by various patients.
Consumers Union told the White House today that it was concerned about another facet of Mr. Clinton's proposal. The consumer group said Mr. Clinton offered "too little protection to low-income families and individuals."
In a letter to Mr. Clinton, Rhoda H. Karpatkin, president of Consumers Union, said his proposal might require some people to spend more than 5 percent of their incomes on health insurance premiums.
"At a minimum," she said, "it is essential that families' and individuals' premiums be capped at a level of about 2 percent of income."

HEADLINE: U.S. Housing Errors Take Financial and Human Toll

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
The walls cracked, the roof leaked, the foundation sank and the sewage boiled up into the bathtubs.
Rents fell and repair costs rose, but the owners of the sprawling, private apartment complex did not bear the burden. They had a Government-insured mortgage, so when they failed to repay their $9.5 million loan, the Government did so for them. 
 That was in 1975. In the 18 subsequent years, Roxse Homes has become a symbol of the human and financial losses in one of the Government's most troubled housing programs.
It has languished in a netherworld of Federal mismanagement, with its ownership contested, its maintenance uncertain, its court battles unending and many of its hundreds of tenants aggrieved.
 
Many May Follow
 This may be a harbinger. In the next few years, the Department of Housing and Urban Development is expecting hundreds of other apartment building owners to follow suit and default on Government-insured mortgages.
The defaults are expected to cost taxpayers as much as $11.9 billion, and they could bring hundreds of thousands of apartments into the hands of the Housing Department, which, by its own admission, has a track record of watching them sink into slums.
The 13 sad, sagging buildings that constitute Roxse Homes offer a particularly striking example of what can go wrong in the loan-guarantee program after an owner defaults.
After almost two decades, the Government has still not received a penny of repayment from the owner, a nonprofit corporation founded by a group of ministers. The Government has not seized the property through foreclosure, though it has pursued a host of other, failed strategies.
And it has not got what its auditors consider a satisfactory accounting of millions of dollars in rent and rehabilitation money that year after year remained under the owners' control.
 
Deterioration Goes On
 The apartments, meanwhile, have continued to deteriorate, through a blizzard of lawsuits and contested subpoenas, tax breaks to wealthy investors and rent strikes by angry tenants. The Government estimates that the apartments now need at least $15 million in new repairs and millions of dollars a year in new operating subsidies.
Department officials refuse to discuss the case while it remains in litigation, but they have been blunt in acknowledging the problems of the mortgage insurance program in general. Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros has called the management of the defaulted buildings "the single largest problem" in a department rife with neglectful practices.
"HUD's management of its own inventory has been abysmal," Mr. Cisneros told the Senate in a June hearing. By allowing the properties to deteriorate, Mr. Cisneros said, the department had "exacerbated the declining quality of life in urban America."
That is an opinion quickly seconded by some of the Roxse tenants, who fault HUD for letting the situation drag on for decades. "If you own a home and don't pay the mortgage, is the bank going to let you sit there for 20 years?" said Nate Maddox, vice president of the tenant council.
 
To Encourage Lenders
 The mortgage insurance programs are designed to increase the nation's housing supply, by encouraging lenders to make loans they would otherwise consider too risky.
The department now backs $43 billion in such mortgages, covering 15,000 projects with approximately 1.8 million apartments. Because of downturns in the real estate market and its own acknowledged mismanagement, the department expects 27 percent of those loans to default, costing taxpayers $11.9 billion.
The Government insures about 750 apartment buildings in New York City and elsewhere in southern New York State. A recent audit by the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand found 33 percent of them in danger of default.
Roxse Homes illustrates the perplexing situation the Government faces after an owner defaults. The department can try to foreclose on the property, seizing it from the owners and reselling it to recoup its losses.
But it seldom does so. That is partly because foreclosure brings hefty financing and management fees. And it is also because a Federal law requires HUD to attach expensive new operating subsidies to foreclosed properties, to be sure that they remain affordable to tenants with modest incomes.
 
Avoiding Foreclosure
 Instead of foreclosing, the Government usually tries to arrange a repayment schedule with the owners, as it did with Roxse Homes. But after 18 years, Roxse's owners have not repaid a cent, arguing that operating expenses consume all its income.
"The project has not produced sufficient income," said James E. Cofield Jr., a Boston businessman who has been the unpaid chairman of the Roxse board since the early 1970's, when he was recruited by the local ministers who founded the nonprofit corporation.
Mr. Cofield blames HUD for the project's problems. He said the department oversaw its flawed construction, resisted rent increases and refused to provide necessary operating subsidies. But a 1989 report from the department's inspector general said that the board had misused Roxse's money, incurred "unnecessary costs" and "did not always act in the best interest of the project."
Roxse was in peril from the start. The construction company hired by the board did not adequately prepare the site, which had been landfill. The foundations settled, causing walls to crack, roofs to leak and sewage lines to rupture.
 
Behind on the Mortgage
 Twenty-two of the project's 364 units were uninhabitable from the time the construction was completed in 1972. As income sagged and expenses rose, the project quickly fell behind on its mortgage payments. In 1975, the bank invoked the Federal insurance, and HUD paid off the $9.5 million mortgage in full.
Roxse then agreed to begin making payments to HUD, though it never did so. Roxse did, however, sue the builder and architect, winning $2.2 million in 1979 to fix the construction defects.
While some improvements were made, the settlement also inaugurated a new phase of financial warfare between the Government and the apartment owners. Mr. Cofield and the board retained control over the money, which was spent not only on roofing and sewer repairs but also on unrelated legal expenses,including a campaign to prevent a highway from being constructed nearby. Mr. Cofield argues that the expenses were proper since the highway would have harmed the quality of neighborhood life.
When HUD sought control of the money, Roxse transferred it into a confidential account kept by the project's lawyer. And when the inspector general subpoenaed documents relating to the expenses, including board minutes and contracts, Roxse fought the effort in court. The court ordered Roxse to turn over some, but not all, of the documents.
Without the documents, the auditors could not complete their work. But their limited inquiry did find that "the project was burdened with unnecessary costs."
 
Accusing the Auditors
 Mr. Cofield accuses the auditors of harassment. "There is no expenditure that we have ever made that we think was improper or not in the interest of the tenants," he said.
As the fight for financial control wore on, HUD was pursuing a new strategy to make Roxse financially viable. In 1984, it gave preliminary approval to a plan to transfer ownership to a pair of California investors.
The partners, James C. Johnson and Barton Schuman, would raise repair money by selling ownership shares to passive investors, who could claim tax breaks. Roxse would contribute $1.7 million of the settlement money. HUD would contribute new operating subsidies.
But the deal began to fall apart when Roxse refused to turn over its share of the money. When a Superior Court judge ordered Roxse to produce documents relating to the fund, Roxse first refused. Then it produced edited documents, including photocopies of checks with essential information, like the bank's name, whited out.
Mr. Cofield said he resisted because the California investors had backed away from a verbal agreement to leave the board in control. "We were in no way trying to hide anything," he said. But citing a "clear violation" of his order, the judge in 1986 ordered the deed transferred to the California investors.
Another legal battle ensued, dragging on so long that the tax laws and HUD policies changed, making the deal less attractive to the investors. In 1990, they gave back the property, leaving Mr. Cofield and the Roxse board in charge.
Roxse, meanwhile, was collecting $1.7 million a year in rent but had still not made any mortgage payments to HUD. Mr. Cofield said the entire amount was needed to pay operating expenses.
In 1991, HUD finally moved to foreclose on the property. Roxse is resisting with a novel legal argument: that if the Government really cared, it would have seized the property long ago.
"If they were so concerned about safe housing, why didn't they do something about it?" said Henry Owens, Roxse's lawyer. The board is seeking to retain title to the property and is asking HUD for as much as $20 million to fix up the buildings, arguing that only the Government has enough money for repairs. "We know HUD is the fat cat in town," Mr. Cofield said.
The Government won a preliminary battle in December, when a Federal court gave it day-to-day control of the project. Though the Government lacks the property deed, this gives it the right to collect rents and pay the bills. The action occurred after the gas company threatened to cut off the heat because of $109,000 in unpaid bills.
Mr. Cofield is vowing to fight on, saying he has only the community's interest in mind. "I have not received one penny in any shape or form in 23 years," he said. "It's just a desire to do something for the neighborhood."
HUD officials say the Roxse fight is lengthy but not unprecedented.
"The projects seem to be caught in an extended never-never-Land," said Nicolas Retsinas, who as the new Federal Housing Commissioner now presides over the loan-guarantee program. In the future, he said, "we need to get off the dime."

HEADLINE: New Missile Defense in Japan Under Discussion With U.S.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Concerned about North Korea's recent tests of a new generation of missiles, Japan and the United States have begun discussions about developing and deploying a new antimissile system on Japanese soil to deter short-range attacks.
Preliminary talks about combining technological talents to build the system, which would be a major expansion of the postwar military relationship between the two countries, were held this week in Honolulu. But Japanese officials say they expect to receive a fuller American proposal next week, during a visit to Tokyo by John M. Deutch, the Pentagon's Under Secretary for Acquisition and Technology.
 
Existing Missile System Aging
 American and Japanese officials say the new system may include major improvements on an existing antimissile system, like the Patriot, combined with some kind of satellite detection system that would warn of an attack. 
 Japan's only missile defense is an aging first-generation Patriot missile system. More advanced versions of the Patriot, the kind used with mixed success against Iraqi attacks in the Persian Gulf war, are not scheduled for deployment until around 1995. Most experts say it would not be very effective against the newly developed North Korean missile, the Rodong 1.
The plan could pose some very tough decisions for the coalition Government headed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The largest party in the coalition, the Socialists, have historically opposed any expansion of the powers of the Japanese military and never recognized Japan's 33-year-old security pact with the United States.
 
Similar Aid to NATO Allies
 Military experts here say an advanced missile defense system could raise additional political problems. The Japanese Government has always shied away from making use of any kind of satellite detection system -- which it has rejected as a violation of its self-imposed ban on using space for military purposes. The country has no spy satellites of its own; it relies almost entirely on the United States for satellite intelligence.
In Washington, a senior Defense Department official said this week that Mr. Deutch would try to lay the groundwork for an agreement in which Japan would develop its own antimissile defense, known as a theater missile defense system, with American assistance. Similar aid has been extended in the past to NATO allies.
"We would enter a cost-sharing agreement with them, but the point is that they couldn't do this themselves," the senior official said. "This is potentially a very different approach to our security relationship with Japan."
But the Japanese have many reservations about the system, and some suggest that Washington has been pushing the idea far harder than Tokyo.
Recently Shigeru Hatakeyama, the Vice Minister of Japan's Defense Agency, was quoted in Japanese newspapers as saying that a jointly developed missile plan might run afoul of Japan's restrictions on collective security efforts, even with longtime allies like the United States.
 
Concern About North Korea
 "There is obviously great interest in defense circles about this, but Mr. Hosokawa has to be very careful," said Masashi Nishihara, the head of research at Japan's National Institute for Defense Studies. "There will be a lot of opposition, and of course the coalition is very fragile. But of course, there is also great uneasiness on everyone's part about what the North Koreans are building."
During the cold war, Japan had no real missile defenses of its own. The biggest threat was believed to come from the Soviet Union, and the country's deterrent was the American nuclear umbrella. But in the last two years, amid growing evidence that North Korea has been developing nuclear weapons and a missile that could deliver them, Japanese officials have begun rethinking the nature of the country's defense.
So has the United States: the topic was reportedly raised briefly on Thursday when the new American Ambassador to Tokyo, former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, met with officials of Japan's Foreign Ministry for the first time. Mr. Mondale took up his post here earlier in the week.
Missile defenses took on new urgency for Japan at the end of May, when North Korea first tested the Rodong 1, a missile it has been developing for years and is reportedly preparing to export to Iran. The test took place along Sea of Japan, with the missile apparently aimed at a buoy off Japan's Noto Peninsula, which juts into the sea on Japan's northwestern coast. American officials say that they have not been able to determine how well the missile performed, but that it flew about 300 miles, or half the distance it is thought to be designed to cover.
Central Intelligence Agency officials have said in Congressional testimony that the agency believes that the missile could be fitted with nuclear warheads if North Korea's nuclear weapons program ever bears fruit.
The Sea of Japan test has become almost an obsession for some Japanese officials, who described it as a direct threat from the country's most unpredictable neighbor. But other Japanese and American officials say that the Communist Government of North Korea intends to sell the missile rather than use it. In the end, they argue, hard currency is worth far more to the nearly bankrupt Communist Government than any offensive power.
Others argue that the missile, if produced, would give the North Koreans another card in their uneasy standoff with the West, creating a way for the North to threaten that any conflict on the Korean Peninsula could spill over elsewhere in Asia.
 
New Satellite Technology
 While several options are being discussed, a new missile defense system for Japan would probably involve a considerable amount of new technology, linking the system to one or more satellites that could detect a launching. Japan studied similar systems in the Pacific in the 1980's, as an adjunct to the Strategic Defense Initiative. This system, in contrast, would be far smaller in scale. "It would still be very expensive," one American official said recently, "and the presumption is that Japan would pay for much of it."
But the Japanese are pleading poverty. With the economy in worse shape here than in anyone's recent memory, the military's budget is not expected to expand more than about 2 percent, and perhaps far less. In the 1980's it regularly expanded 6 percent or more annually. A few military officials here concede that the North Korean threat has given the agency its best argument yet in favor of expanding its budget, and that reason alone could propel talks about building the new system.

HEADLINE: Whitman Finds Her Voice in New Jersey Race

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 17

 BODY:
Christine Todd Whitman has surfaced. After a long and leisurely summer, the Republican gubernatorial candidate has hit the road in her campaign to unseat Jim Florio, trailing a big-name Republican consultant, a staff of exuberant young aides and two unwelcome guests.
"It's just dumb, it's silly," Mrs. Whitman said during a drive to a Mercer County campaign stop this week, talking about the two fresh-faced workers from the Governor's campaign who shadow her across the state, waiting for slips of the tongue. She neglected to mention that Republican workers sometimes shadow Mr. Florio for the same reason. 
 "All I can think," she said, "is that they must be bored, because they hear the same thing in every speech."
Indeed, Christine Todd Whitman is a paragon of consistency on the stump. She may tailor her speech to fit the occasion -- discussing the importance of placing more women in public office with the North Jersey Association of Female Executives, for example.
But the heart of Mrs. Whitman's stump speech is always the same. Often vague, sometimes hard to discern, but always the same:
New Jersey is a great state. Mr. Florio has been a poor Governor. His $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990 devastated the economy, drove business from the state and cost thousands of people their jobs. His administration is pro-tax, anti-business and a barrier to efforts to streamline government. Her administration would be the opposite.
"I believe the only thing we have missed in order to be a leading state in the nation is the leadership that recognizes the fact that we can be that way, but only if we bring everyone into the process," she said to a group of public administrators, government accountants and public managers in Hamilton Township.
"I believe we're at a crossroads," she told about 80 members of the New Jersey Concrete and Aggregate Association at a Holiday Inn in Jamesburg in Middlesex County. "We can continue with a policy of tax and spend, or we can move into a policy that looks to cut and save. We can continue with a policy that says we're putting economic obstacles in the way of doing business, that government is the answer to everything, or move to a policy that says we want business, and government should be a partner to facilitate business."
And, she tells nearly every audience she addresses, "New Jersey is a state that should be No. 1 in the nation -- not in unemployment, not in regulation and not in taxes, but number one in ideas and innovation and growth."
Mrs. Whitman, 46, is an accomplished campaigner though she has undergone only three other campaigns. She twice won election to the Somerset County Board of Chosen Freeholders, and in 1990 she metamorphosed from unknown Republican insider to credible statewide candidate when she nearly upset Bill Bradley, the state's United States Senator, in his re-election bid.
As she did in the 1990 race, Mrs. Whitman hopes to win undecided voters this year by reminding them of their anger over the $2.8 billion tax increase.
But even voters who do not like Mr. Florio say they want to hear more from Mrs. Whitman than a critique of the Governor. They want to know, specifically, what she would do if she were in his chair.
 
Warmer Than Florio
 At the same time, the voters who find she comes up short on details react warmly to her as a person, especially when they compare her with Mr. Florio, who can seem personally unbending.
Mrs. Whitman is personable without being personal, approachable if somewhat removed. Almost everyone who knows her calls her Christie, and many people who do not know her do the same.
On the way to an evening meeting at Cedar Gardens restaurant on Route 33 in Hamilton Township, Mrs. Whitman reviewed her speech, joked with her driver and discussed common acquaintances with her friend Edward Rollins, who ran Ronald Reagan's 1984 'Morning in America' campaign and who hopes to duplicate that success for Mrs. Whitman.
As the car pulled up to the restaurant, Mrs. Whitman waved to a sheepish Greg Orlando, one of the two Florio shadows, and joked, "Well, we know we're in the right place because there's Greg."
At most of her campaign stops, Mrs. Whitman takes pains to shake as many hands as possible, patiently working the room while her young aides hover about, trying to keep her on schedule.
Her typical speech lasts no longer than 15 or 20 minutes, is delivered without notes and lays the blame for everything from too much regulation to failing schools to dying businesses at Mr. Florio's feet without offering many specific solutions.
Consider this segment about education from a speech to the New Jersey Concrete and Aggregate Association:
"We seemed to have introduced politics into absolutely every phase of government. That's part of the problem we've seen in education. I know you've read the newspaper stories of the judges' decision recently on the Quality Education Act that said not only did we fail to solve the problem by throwing money at it, it was also unconstitutional.
 
'We're Cheating Our Children'
 "And you know there is a grand jury investigation going on in this state as to how some of that money was distributed, and was it used for political ends? Again, that's wrong. Because we're cheating our children and cheating our future. And we simply cannot allow politics to play a role when talking about something as important as education. We have got to make those decisions based on what's best for the children and what's best in policy, not what's best for politicians, even though I am the first to say I am one."
The only specifics Mrs. Whitman mentioned in the speech were her proposal for requiring economic impact statements before any new regulation is enacted -- something state agencies already do -- and her criticism of a 7 percent tax on heavy trucks that was included in Mr. Florio's tax plan but later repealed by the Legislature.
Voters are concerned about this vagueness about what Mrs. Whitman would deliver as governor.
"People are still angry with Florio, but people still haven't heard enough from Christie," said Michael Mitschele, who was at the concrete association meeting and who reported that many of his friends are undecided.
 
'So She Has Money'
 At least where Mrs. Whitman chose to campaign this week, people seemed to have little interest in the Florio campaign's attempt to paint her as wealthy and out of touch.
"That's not an issue to me," said Charles Sanders at a Hamilton Township campaign stop. "So she has money. So what?"
"She sounds good," said Loranna Nebel after hearing Mrs. Whitman speak there. "But can she follow through? We need some common sense. People in government don't have any common sense."

HEADLINE: Mayoral Report Credits Administration With Better Crime-Fighting and More Services

BYLINE: By LARRY OLMSTEAD

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins released his annual management report yesterday, saying the city had made gains in fighting crime and delivering services under his leadership. He used the opportunity to criticize Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposal to curtail services for some homeless people.
Pressing his re-election campaign against Mr. Giuliani, the Mayor said the improvements cited in the report, in areas ranging from lowering infant mortality to instituting citywide recycling, came despite economic constraints he said were brought on by the Reagan and Bush Administrations. 
 "What is especially noteworthy about this management report is that when economic push came to shove I did not allow the wholesale scuttling of essential service after essential service," Mr. Dinkins said, addressing reporters and top city officials, including several dozen heads of city agencies.
Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that the report cited several setbacks. For instance, narcotics arrests have fallen, ambulance response times have risen, fire response times are up in three boroughs, and there are more homeless people in hotels.
The 856-page report, prepared by Norman Steisel, the First Deputy Mayor, and Harvey Robins, director of the Mayor's Office of Operations, used 4,000 indicators to measure the delivery of city services. It covered the fiscal year running from July 1, 1992, through June 30 of this year.
"In bad times, you expect only bad news," Mr. Dinkins said. "But as this report demonstrates, six years of bad economic news has not translated into bad news across the board for city services."
Not surprisingly, Mr. Giuliani's campaign argued that under Mr. Dinkins's leadership, the quality of city government and life has declined.
"Our view is that the Dinkins-Steisel administration has provided one management bungle after another," said Richard Bryers, communications director for the campaign. "The quality of government service has declined, as has the quality of life."
Mr. Bryers said Mr. Giuliani advocated trimming the city's workforce and increasing bonus and incentive pay.
"The Mayor is spending $6 billion more a year than Mayor Koch was," Mr. Bryers said. "I think voters have a legitimate question as to whether that $6 billion is being spent wisely."
One issue of contention between the candidates is how to handle the problem of homelessness. The Mayor's report said the number of homeless families given temporary housing in fiscal 1993 was 5,695, up from 5,229 the previous year. Those in hotels have steadily risen, from 358 in fiscal year 1990 to 1,159 in fiscal year 1993, despite the administration's position that it would prefer homeless people in more permanent housing.
 
Homeless Advocates Upset
 Mr. Giuliani, who released a position paper on the issue Thursday, was criticized yesterday by advocates for the homeless, who were particularly upset by his proposal to limit the shelter stay for many to 90 days.
Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said it would organize a group of homeless people to confront Mr. Giuliani at least once a day at one of his public campaign appearances.
The position paper said the 90-day limit would allow the city to focus more of its limited resources on the "chronically homeless," including people who are drug-addicted, alcoholic, mentally ill and HIV-infected.
Mr. Bryers said the point of the proposal was to force the government to act within 90 days to put people into "appropriate housing and services." Mr. Giuliani was simply trying to get people out of shelters "so they can become independent."
But Mr. Dinkins said the proposal "demonstrates a lack of compassion and concern, or a lack of understanding. I think you will see a speedy retreat from this position by Mr. Giuliani."
Administration officials acknowledged they are still trying to reduce the number of homeless families in hotels. The process has been slowed, they said, by a lack of alternative housing sites, partly due to cuts in federal financing.
 
More Police Officers
 Mr. Dinkins's management report also noted that the number of uniformed police officers has risen above 30,000 for the first time since 1975 and that crime fell 7.2 percent the last fiscal year in the seven major categories monitored by the F.B.I.
But narcotics arrests fell by 4.4 percent to 50,266. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly attributed the drop to a decrease in the number of narcotics officers because of attrition and a diversion of officers to street patrol.
Now, he said, narcotics staffing levels are improving and arrests should go up.
The report also showed that average fire response time rose in Staten Island, Brooklyn and the Bronx, and fell in Manhattan and Queens. The longest response time was on Staten Island, where it was 5 minutes and 25 seconds, up by nine seconds.
The infant mortality rate dropped from 11.4 per 1,000 live births in calendar 1991 to 10.2 last year, the report said. Among the reasons cited was the opening of 12 community health centers.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Holtzman's Response to Loan Inquiry

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Elizabeth Holtzman's response to a New York City Department of Investigation report on an inquiry into a campaign loan to her from Fleet Bank. The report said that Holtzman was "grossly negligent" in failing to ascertain whether Fleet subsidiaries were doing or seeking business with her office.
 
Treatment by Fleet
Comptroller Holtzman got no special treatment from Fleet Bank. There is no finding in the D.O.I. report that either the interest rate on the loan to the Comptroller's Senate campaign or other loan terms were favorable or better than what any candidate for office could obtain. To the contrary, the D.O.I. report lists other campaign loans Fleet Bank made on similar or better terms.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Comptroller Holtzman did not get a favorable loan from Fleet Bank, so under the provisions of the City Charter, she was not obliged to determine if the bank was doing business with the City. Thus, the Comptroller was not negligent, let alone "grossly negligent." 

Terms of the Loan
D.O.I. did not find that the interest rate or other terms of the loan to the Holtzman for Senate campaign were favorable.
In fact, the terms of the loan were onerous. The effective annual interest rate on the loan, considering the original term and the $4,500 fee, was more than 18 percent. Fleet Bank's insistence on a personal guarantee exceeds the requirements of federal election law, which permits loans based solely on fund-raising pledges. Comptroller Holtzman was so opposed to the demand for a personal guarantee that she asked the Senate Campaign to seek another source for the loan. The Senate Campaign would have done so if time had permitted.
The D.O.I. report says that, according to Fleet's internal documents, campaign loans are undesirable. Despite this internal document, Fleet made several other loans similar to this campaign loan, some with lower interest rates.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The report states what the Comptroller has always said, that she was involved only in selecting the senior managers and in ensuring that minority- and women-owned firms were included among the underwriters selected. The report found no evidence that Comptroller Holtzman participated in or influenced in any way the City's choice of Fleet Securities as a co-manager.
The D.O.I. report did not find that the promotion of Fleet Securities was based on favoritism or any improper factor. Fleet, which had been part of the large group that sells the City's bonds, was one of 23 co-managers selected in a joint decision by the Mayor's Office and the Comptroller's Office. The Comptroller's staff recommended Fleet be promoted from the selling group because it sold more bonds than any other bank in its group.
The taxpayers of the city did not lose a single penny because of the selection of Fleet as co-manager. The cost of selling the city's bonds was not affected in any way. In fact, the City's bonds were recently sold at the lowest interest costs in 20 years. Due to innovations initiated by the Comptroller, refundings and lower interest rates, taxpayers have saved more than $800 million.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The D.O.I. report is only part of the process. The report does not include significant facts and also contains some factual errors. Comptroller Holtzman was not allowed to present witnesses, to offer information D.O.I. did not request or to question witnesses. In other words, Comptroller Holtzman was not given a chance to present her side of the story. That is a basic right of due process available to everyone under our democratic system. D.O.I. reports are normally kept confidential in part because, before the process is completed, public officials have not had an opportunity to be heard.
The D.O.I. report is now before the Conflicts of Interest Board (C.O.I.B.), which can accept or reject any part of it. During the C.O.I.B.'s process, Comptroller Holtzman will have a chance to present her side. It is important to understand that the D.O.I. report is preliminary step -- it is not the final determination.

 	 	 		. . .	 	The D.O.I. report relies on Comptroller Holtzman's attendance at a June 12, 1992, breakfast meeting with representatives of Fleet Securities as evidence that she knew that Fleet was seeking to do business with the City. During the summer of 1992, Ms. Holtzman met with well over 100 different groups in a very short period of time. Ms. Holtzman has said that, given that hectic schedule, she is not certain she was aware of the identities of the people at that specific breakfast. There is no finding by D.O.I. that Comptroller Holtzman in any way suggested that Fleet could have businesses as co-manager or special access to city business.
 
Press Release
The D.O.I. report states that "Fleet Securities was identified as one of the firms selected for co-manager in a press release announcing the selection of seior managers and co-managers." D.O.I. did not call as a witness Ms. Holtzman's press secretary, who would have testified that she prepared and issued the release without showing it to Ms. Holtzman.
 
Signature on Statement
D.O.I. mentions that the Official Statement, which is signed by the Comptroller, includes a list of the managers and co-managers on its cover. But it ignores the testimony of the Bureau Chief for Debt Management, who told D.O.I. that he went to City Hall where the Comptroller was testifying at a hearing and gave her the Official Statements to sign, already opened to the last page. Nor did D.O.I. note that the Comptroller would not normally read the long "boiler plate" official documents that accompany bond sales, since most of the language is standard and it has already been carefully checked by the City's and the underwriter's bond counsels. The Comptroller did not ". . . personally approve a 'tombstone,' which also listed Fleet Securities. . . ." The evidence shows that the Comptroller was not shown that "tombstone" -- the cover page of the Official Statement.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
For Municipal Bonds, Scandals Spur Change

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne

 BODY:
THE report issued this week finding that Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman of New York City was "grossly negligent" in receiving a campaign loan from a bank she selected to underwrite city bonds was the latest episode in a series of political scandals roiling the $1.2 trillion municipal finance market.
Elsewhere, there have been allegations that Merrill Lynch & Company made illegal payments to a firm close to a top gubernatorial aide in New Jersey, and reports of illegal fee-splitting arrangements in municipal bond deals in Louisiana and Massachusetts. 
 What's a concerned investor to do? Flee the market in disgust?
 Aiming to silence suggestions that the municipal securities market is a corrupt game, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, which oversees the market, is circulating a draft of two proposals designed to increase investor confidence.
Both proposals deal with disclosure: one requires more disclosure of political contributions by bond underwriters, and the other requires municipal bond issuers to report more to bond buyers about their financial condition.
Because individuals, either directly or through mutual funds, own more than 80 percent of the municipal bonds outstanding, how these proposals will affect investor sensibilities becomes a matter of real concern. Big buyers of municipal bonds say the effort can only help improve investor confidence -- especially among investors who look at more than interest rates.
"We judge each bond on its merits," said Anne Punzak, a municipal bond portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments, which has $25 billion in municipal bonds. "But, as a result of these scandals, there's an illusion of impropriety in the market, and that's not good. It's probably more of an illusion than actual. These rules may help to end it and make the market more liquid for all investors involved."
To be sure, few investors probably make any connection between political contributions and municipal bond investments -- so it is doubtful these rules, which must be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, are a front-burner issue with all municipal bond buyers. Political contributions, after all, have nothing to do with a bond's creditworthiness.
Richard Moynihan, president of municipal bond funds at Dreyfus, which has $30 billion in tax-exempt securities, suggests the proposed rules could curtail contributions by bond underwriting firms to local politicians. At the least, he said, the rules would give the investing public "more comfort" that "everything is aboveboard."
The other proposal would oblige municipal issuers to continue providing financial information to bondholders after a bond is issued. "Investors are not receiving as much financial information as they are entitled to, and neither are the dealers selling to them," said Michael E. Dougherty, a partner at Dougherty Dawkins Strand & Bigelow, a Minneapolis bond dealer. "So an investor buying a bond in the secondary maket can have no idea of the current financial status of the issuer."
Christopher A. Taylor, executive director of the municipal rule-making board, said such financial disclosure was "fundamental to the market."
"Investors in bonds want to know what is happening to the bonds they are investing in," Mr. Taylor said. "The more financial information that is available about the underlying issuers in the market, the better the fund market is, too. This will make it easier even for someone as large as Fidelity to do research."
One well-known New York bond dealer, James A. Lebenthal, begs to differ. He contends that the new provisions would "just cut the legs out" from smaller, infrequent issuers -- "some swell little school district," he offers as an example -- that does not have the resources to keep detailed financial records. "There isn't a piece of information that you can't get by picking up the phone and calling the issuer," said Mr. Lebenthal, who heads a company that bears his name. "If there are nonrated mom-and-pop issues, the public has no business getting into these bonds. To get taken in this business, you really have to have a 'kick me' sign on you," Mr. Lebenthal said.
Jerry Jacobs, a vice president at the Vanguard Group, which has about $24 billion in municipal bonds, said, however, that firms like Mr. Lebenthal's would benefit the most from the new rules. "Big mutual funds have the money to pay for big research staffs," he said. "But down the line, smaller mutual funds and smaller investment companies might not have the same resources. This should help them."

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Lower Demand in London Pushes Down Copper Prices

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Copper prices plunged yesterday to the lowest levels in four months as heavy demand for copper for immediate delivery suddenly eased on the London Metals Exchange.
In London, demand for delivered copper had pushed prices above those paid for future delivery, a situation that traders call a "backwardation." But that demand eased yesterday, traders said. 
 Without the unusual demand from London, copper prices will reflect high stockpiles and slow economic growth, traders said.
"The market is settling down to where the fundamentals indicate it should be," said Robert Lesemann, an analyst of base metals with Resource Strategies Inc. in Exton, Pa.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, copper for December delivery fell 2.40 cents, to 78.65 cents a pound. In London, copper for immediate delivery fell $182 a ton, to $1,754, while December copper settled down $100 at $1,770 a ton.
One reason for yesterday's collapse was a move by the board of governors of the London Metals Exchange to impose a $5-a-ton limit on the amount that delivered copper could trade above copper futures. "It looks like the steps the governors' board have taken are working," Mr. Leseman said.
On other commodity markets, lumber futures shot up as much as allowed in a day amid fears that new duties imposed by the United States on Canadian lumber might escalate into a trade war. Lumber for November delivery gained $10, to $316.70 for 1,000 board feet, on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
The United States imposed duties of 6.51 percent on Canadian softwood lumber in retaliation for Canadian provincial subsidies for producers. That duty rate is now being recalculated, and no one is yet sure what the new rate will be.
Oil prices ended higher, as traders became more optimistic that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would act to control production at their meeting in Geneva next week. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude oil for October delivery gained 24 cents, to $17.07 a barrel. October heating oil rose 0.51 cent, to 51.92 cents a gallon, and October unleaded gasoline rose 0.66 cent, to 48.88 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises as Investors Await Japan's Trade Actions

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most leading currencies in light trading yesterday as investors waited to see if Japan would take further steps to calm trade tensions that have fueled the yen's advance this year.
Also yesterday, gold prices ended a three-day rally. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for October delivery dropped $1.90, to $351.10 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $350.75 an ounce, down $1.45. 
 Currency brokers said trading was quiet because of the Jewish holiday Rosh ha-Shanah and because the market was still digesting Tokyo's announcement Thursday of a stimulus package meant in part to shrink Japan's trade surplus.
"Right now the market is saying it's highly skeptical" that the package will be enough, said David De Rosa, a director at the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York. He said the yen would remain in a tight range until it became clear whether Japan planned a further economic stimulus and whether Washington was satisfied with the Japanese actions.
 
Back to a Strong-Yen Policy?
 "On people's minds in the market was, 'Is this going to be a return to the strong-yen policy?" asked Win Thin, of MCM Currencywatch, an analysis service in New York.
The yen rose steadily against the dollar this year as traders perceived the United States Government as supporting a strong yen as a way to shrink Japan's trade surplus. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive and foreign imports in Japan cheaper. In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 104.50 yen, from 104.15 on Thursday.
The dollar also rose against the German mark. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6154 marks, up from 1.6025 marks. Traders say the move may have been influenced by remarks by Guntram Palm, a member of the German central bank's policy-making Central Bank Council, who said German inflation would probably fall to an annual 3.5 percent by the end of the year from 4.2 percent now.
With lower inflation, Germany could drop its relatively high interest rates. Such a move could stimulate its recession-bound economy but would probably cause the mark to fall in value, since mark-denominated investments would earn less.

HEADLINE: A Consumer Index Is Flat

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The University of Michigan's preliminary consumer sentiment index was essentially flat in September, edging up to 77.4, from 77.3 in August, people with access to the survey said yesterday.
The tiny gain was below economists' expectations. They expected the index to rise to between 77.5 and 79, said Fred Leiner, market strategist for Continental Bank in Chicago. 
 The index remains well below the post-election high of 91, in December. The index is based on 100, set in 1966. As consumers become more pessimistic about the economy, the monthly reading drops further below 100.
The university also reported that its preliminary September index of consumer expectations, which measures how people feel about their future, fell to 64.3, from 65.8 in August. The early September index of current economic conditions rose to 97.9, from 95.1 in August.
Since 1966, the record high for the sentiment index is 101, set in March 1984.

HEADLINE: Bonds Recoup Some of Early Losses

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices bounced back from early losses yesterday as bargain hunters emerged once again when prices hit a daily low.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond ended down 5/32 point, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, edged up to 6.04 percent, from 6.03 percent on Thursday. 
 But the 10-year Treasury note gained 4/32 point while its yield slipped to 5.37 percent from 5.39 percent.
Intermediate Treasury maturities also rose by up to 4/32 point, while short-term Treasury prices were unchanged to 1/32 point higher.
Prices sank early in the session in what analysts said was a follow-through to some selling late Thursday.
But renewed demand from investors, particularly mutual fund portfolio managers, helped to arrest the price declines yesterday.
"There was some retail buying earlier in the morning when we got down to the lows; people started bottom fishing," said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government Securities Inc.
Mr. Ricchiuto said investors largely shrugged off a University of Michigan survey showing that consumer confidence was virtually unchanged in early September. But some analysts said the confidence report was gloomier than expected and helped ease fears of rising inflation.
Those fears were fanned on Tuesday when the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose three-tenths of a percent in August, the biggest increase since a rise of four-tenths of a percent in April.
"It looks like consumer spirits remain grim, and that's brought some buying into the market on a scattered basis," said William Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter, Discover & Company.
Prices in the bond market have fallen and yields have risen through most of the week in a partial reversal of the recent powerful rally. The yield on the 30-year bond is still about one-half percentage point lower than it was six weeks ago. "The market is trying to catch its breath because the rally was so swift and pronounced," said Douglas Schindewolf, money market economist for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company.
The rally's impact on interest rates elsewhere in the economy is still filtering through. Yesterday, two Midwestern banks, Harris Trust and Savings Bank and United Missouri Bancshares Inc., cut their prime lending rates one-quarter point, to 5 3/4 percent. Their moves brought to four the number of banks that have cut their prime rates this week.
Next week, the Treasury market digests its first auction of intermediate maturities in more than a month. The Treasury Department plans to sell $16 billion in two-year notes on Tuesday and $11 billion in five-year notes on Wednesday.
The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index was unchanged yesterday at 1,329.20.
The discount rates on Treasury bills were also unchanged, with three-month bills at 2.94 percent, six-month bills at 3.06 percent and one-year bills at 3.25 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 105 1/8, down 1/16 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was 5.46 percent, up from 5.45 percent.

HEADLINE: Health Cost Payment in Ford Pact

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
The tentative labor contract negotiated this week between the Ford Motor Company and the United Automobile Workers union contains a provision under which workers would forgo a small portion of their wage increases partly to help pay for their health care.
According to one estimate, the change could be worth about $180 million to Ford over the life of the three-year contract, and $400 million to the General Motors Corporation should a comparable provision be negotiated there. Last year, Ford spent $1.5 billion on health care for its blue-collar workers. 
 Health care was one of the most hotly contested issues at the bargaining table this year. Owen F. Bieber, the U.A.W. president, repeatedly said the union would not ask its members to begin paying deductibles or co-payments toward their care, but Ford officials were equally adamant about finding a way to limit costs.
 
Taken From Quarterly Raise
 Union officials say they recognize that high health care costs impose a competitive burden on the Big Three.
As a result, the bargainers agreed to use an arcane maneuver common to recent agreements: essentially, the company keeps a few pennies from hourly wages that would otherwise have been paid as part of a quarterly cost-of-living increase.
The result is an overall savings to the company on its cost of labor. Union officials said, however, that part of their purpose in giving up the money was to defray the rising cost of health care.
Asked after announcing the agreement late on Wednesday whether the union had preserved its health care benefits, Mr. Bieber referred to his past statements on the subject, implying he had achieved his aims. He added, "I'll look at putting a couple of notes together" for the U.A.W. council that will review the agreement. "I won't have to spend a lot of time in some areas," he said.
Under the tentative agreement, the money will not come directly from workers' pockets, which makes it an easier concession to sell to U.A.W. members, who are expected to vote on the contract in the next two weeks.
"If it's money you didn't have before, you didn't give up anything," said Dan Luria, a senior fellow at the Industrial Technology Institute in Ann Arbor, Mich. "The implicit quid pro quo is that this was the trade for no co-pays or deductibles for current workers' health care."
According to Mr. Luria's calculations, the change works out to a savings of roughly $1,870 a worker over three years. That breaks down to about $52 a month -- the size of a reasonable copayment.
Aside from cost-of-living adjustments, the new contract calls for wage increases of about 3 percent a year. At Ford, an assembly-line worker now makes about $17.01 an hour.
The 1990 contract also had a cost-of-living giveback, but it was far smaller and had no explicit purpose. In 1973, the union gave back part of its cost-of-living raise to help pay for a new dental care benefit.
According to officials familiar with the provision, the savings to the company will amount to 32 cents an hour for each worker by the end of the three-year agreement.
Under the pact, the company would keep the 10-cent cost-of-living adjustment earmarked for each worker for the quarter just passed. Then it would keep 4 cents a quarter beginning the first quarter of the contract and another 4 cents beginning the quarter after that. Beyond that, the company would begin keeping another 2 cents for each of the next seven quarters.
Workers' wages would still have protection against inflation because a large portion of the Consumer Price Index, which is used to calculate the cost-of-living adjustment, reflects health care costs. Because health care is now fully paid by the company, the worker does not need inflation protection against that cost.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
The Dalai Lama, whom Tibetan tradition considers an incarnation of a divine figure, the Buddha of Compassion, is both a temporal and a spiritual leader.
Many people who meet him are unsure what protocol to observe. One visitor, explaining his nervousness to a young Buddhist monk some years ago, was reassured by the reply that the Dalai Lama "is a very laid-back deity." 
 And so he is. Two weeks ago, in a penthouse suite at the Palmer House in Chicago, the Tibetan spiritual and political leader was giving a handful of interviews. Monks stood in attendance, amid chairs and couches upholstered in a pale echo of their own dark maroon robes. Assistants in business suits spoke into cellular telephones and distributed copies of the Dalai Lama's letters to the Chinese Government.
As the Dalai Lama went from one interview to another, it would be inaccurate to say he moved in a pool of tranquillity. The special atmosphere of this Buddha of Compassion feels more like a gentle eddy of whimsy.
That was certainly true the evening before, when he spoke at an open-air session closing the Parliament of the World's Religions before 10,000 people at Grant Park. Like the Pope, he seemed to absorb and return the enthusiasm of a crowd. Sometimes he stumbled in his broken English and engaged his translator in amusing byplay. People who have heard the Dalai Lama frequently say that these riffs are not always as spontaneous as they appear.
His impishness on some issues drew laughter where the Pope might have prompted howls of protest. At one point the Dalai Lama began to discourse on birth control. All life is precious, he said, but "precious lives -- too many now." (Was that a shadow passing over the face of Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago, seated on the stage?)
Of course, said the Dalai Lama, we must have "nonviolent birth control." For example, the Tibetan leader said, "more monks and more nuns."
Cardinal Bernardin joined in the laughter.
To an interviewer from an Indian television station, the Dalai Lama talked politics. No, he said, "The world is not forgetting Tibet." The Tibetan resistance has worldwide support because it is nonviolent, he said, and "this kind of freedom struggle must succeed so other people can adopt it."
He was asked, as he regularly is, about his feelings toward the Chinese Communists, who in 1949 enforced with troops what they claimed was a historical sovereignty over Tibet. The Communists exiled the Dalai Lama in 1959 after a national uprising and over the years have killed and imprisoned thousands of Tibetans, obliterated much of the land's religious patrimony and exploited its resources.
He answered as he always has: It is not only possible to overcome hatred, it is essential. "If our mind is dominated by hatred," he said, "the brain cannot make long-term and short-term judgments."
The Dalai Lama is convinced that China cannot resist the demand for freedom that swept away Communism elsewhere. Tibet, he believes, will not only be liberated but become a spiritual resource for post-Communist China.
These are hopes that fly against the immediate prospects. The Dalai Lama acknowledged that despite years of contacts with the Chinese Government, his diplomatic overtures have produced no results. The Dalai Lama has said that Tibetan people and their culture are being swamped by China's movement of ethnic Chinese into Tibet. Tibetans in exile assert that this policy of "demographic aggression" has recently been stepped up.
One of the Dalai Lama's greatest concerns has been the preservation of Tibetan Buddhist faith and culture in the face of oppression and exile. So how would he advise other religious leaders who believe that their communities, too, live in a kind of exile and confront a kind of oppression -- not of armed force and political ideology but of seductive materialism and cultural derision?
The Dalai Lama paused a long time before speaking. "I don't know how to answer," he said. "I always take the essential part of religion and culture -- what is truly useful in our daily live." This must be distinguished, he said, from "the ceremonial part and from social habit." The latter can change, he said. Indeed, he added, "in some cases it must; it must be transformed for new circumstances."
"Young Tibetans change their hair style, their behavior," he said. "I don't care, as long as they keep the spirit of Tibet and religion."
But what would he say to a growing number of religious leaders in the West who fear that without clear lines of demarcation, without a strong sense of a particular religious identity -- Catholic, Jewish, Presbyterian, Muslim, whatever -- their own traditions would be assimilated out of existence?
The Dalai Lama did not alter course in replying. "In my experience, there is too much emphasis on what is minor and not on what is essential," he said. And what is essential involves "being able to transform the individual from within." He called the strong feeling of "my" religion a danger and "the source of fundamentalism."
Perhaps the Tibetan spiritual master underestimates the other dangers nagging religious leaders. His people in diaspora remain tightly joined by language, culture, memory, family, economy and politics.
Nonetheless his answer was clear. Religious leaders determined to preserve their traditions should be less anxious about defining boundaries and more concerned about their faiths' power to bring about personal inner transformation. This was not mere whimsy.

HEADLINE: Boksburg's Goofy White Smiles

BYLINE: By Bill Keller; Bill Keller is the Johannesburg bureau chief for The New York Times.

 BODY:
IF YOU COLLECTED THE MOST outlandish caricatures of white South Africa and wrapped them in blue robes, the result, many South Africans would tell you, would be the Boksburg City Council. It is hard to imagine a more typecast assembly of unrepentant racists and sanctimonious ultrapatriots than the right-wing majority elected in 1988 to run this suburb on the eastern edge of Johannesburg's urban sprawl, and still running it three years into the era of F. W. de Klerk's reforms.
There are moderates on the Council. But they are barely audible in the company of such showmen as Beyers de Klerk, a real-estate agent and auctioneer who carries a pistol at his side and a Bible in his briefcase, copiously underlined to highlight the passages that prove God was against mixing the races. (He disavows any relationship to the other de Klerk, joking that the President's initials stand for "Farewell, white man.") 
 Councilman Koos van de Merwe is a bald prankster who, after President de Klerk announced the phasing out of apartheid, was caught defacing traffic signs to read "STOP F. W." Van de Merwe was also accused of being involved in the detonation of a mine in a crowded commercial bazaar last Easter. (The councilman said that he thought the bombing was a fine idea, but that he didn't do it.)
The women on the Council's right wing are less flamboyant but just as reactionary. Gloria Bosch led a campaign this year to prevent black athletes from using the city stadium. Stephanie Greyling tried to persuade the city to spurn a $200 million windfall from Taiwanese investors who chose Boksburg as the site for a Chinatown housing and commercial complex. Greyling worried the city would be overrun by tong cutthroats. "If I had my way, I'd send them all back to China," she says.
And so when Boksburg's most famous black resident was gunned down in his driveway on April 10, the last thing anyone expected from the City Council was a dignified response. Chris Hani was, after all, the leader of the Communist Party. While to blacks he was a charismatic figure, second in popularity only to Nelson Mandela, in the right-wing precincts of Boksburg he was regarded roughly the way Abu Nidal is in the Jewish wards of Brooklyn.
Boksburg, however, chose not to live up to its reputation. At the first Council meeting after the assassination, Koos van de Merwe rose and, to gapes of amazement, suggested a minute of silence in honor of the slain black leader. Then Beyers de Klerk convened the management committee and permitted black leaders to hold a memorial rally in the Old Town Hall. Until recently, blacks could not hold a wedding reception in the Town Hall, let alone a political rally.
"We looked at it from a business point of view," Councilman de Klerk explains-1. "If we hadn't said yes, there would have been chaos. If we had not given them the civic center, they would have pulled the place apart."
And besides, de Klerk says, Chris Hani was "a son of Boksburg."
In the days to come, it was as if blacks had finally claimed a small place in the political landscape of Boksburg. On the day of Hani's funeral, they streamed through the municipality again to bury the fallen Communist in a cemetery at the southern city limits. They assembled outside the courthouse to watch his accused killer, a Polish immigrant with no ties to Boksburg, arrive for arraignment.
For some Boksburg whites, those with money and passports from other places, the spectacle of black protest was the cue to put their houses on the market and join the exodus known here as the "chicken run." Others rushed to the gun shops or enlisted in the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, the paramilitary brigade that in June lay siege to the convention center where the end of white rule is being negotiated. (The negotiations are taking place just a rifle shot from the Boksburg city line, in Kempton Park.)
But the lesson of Boksburg is that most whites have nowhere to go and little will to fight. They have jobs and mortgages and children in school. While not exactly embracing the new order with enthusiasm, whites have already begun to adapt to it with a sense of resignation embodied, by prescient accident, in Boksburg's city motto: "Respice Finem" ("Heed the End").
A FEW WEEKS AFTER HANI WAS killed, I met Beyers de Klerk in his office in the new Boksburg Civic Center, a concrete tower that looms above the old, low-rise downtown in a style someone described as Riot Gothic. De Klerk is descended from Flemish and Scottish forebears, the first of whom landed in Cape Province in 1688, giving a certain weight to his claim that Africa is his birthright. With his jowls covered in gray bristle and a nose knocked askew during an amateur boxing career, de Klerk, who is 50, looks the part he relishes -- the good-natured outlaw.
In Boksburg, many people regard Beyers de Klerk as a one-man embodiment of the white dilemma. He is a separatist by conviction, but as a businessman he knows the price of isolation and so he has acquiesced in the onslaught of democracy -- up to a point. Recently, moderates have begun to hold up Beyers as an example of a man who has come to his senses, a born-again realist. Right-wingers like Gloria Bosch huff that he is a traitor, a man who has sold out his country for the sake of his real-estate franchise.
De Klerk says that he is just as alarmed by the country's drift as are his right-wing tormentors. As we chat, a woman from the bank drops by with a check for him to sign and he presses her to tell the visiting foreigner how she feels about the new South Africa. Like most whites, she speaks not of blacks and whites but of savages and the civilized.
"If Joe Soap from Soweto wants to move in next to me, O.K.," she says. "But the cannibalism has got to be taken out of them. They've got no respect for human life."
The councilman nods in sympathy.
"It's not a question of living together," he says. "Each white in this country has been living with a black in his backyard since day one -- his servants. I have no problem eating with blacks, living with blacks. Why? Because we rule. But it changes when you don't rule."
So much for theory. We boarded the councilman's black BMW and set off on a tour of the city that calls itself "the gateway to Africa."
BOKSBURG, LIKE MANY CITIES strung along the great geological reef called the Witwatersrand, was a gold rush town. It was founded in 1887, on an ugly, treeless plain populated mainly by jackals and wild ostriches, and named for Willem Bok, who as the Secretary of State for what was then the Transvaal Republic was the man who registered the gold claims. East Rand Proprietary Mines Ltd. still extracts ore from several shafts and its hulking slag heaps dominate the plateau like squat volcanoes. But the city has long since spread and diversified.
Today, Boksburg's gold mine is Jan Smuts Airport, just to the north of the city. Proximity to the country's biggest airport has brought multinational industry. Boksburg's booming precincts are Jet Park, a spanking new region of warehouses and light industry, and the southern hemisphere's largest shopping center, the East Rand Mall. Housing tracts have marched south from the city center deep into the cornfields.
The racial demarcations are essentially those established in the 1960's by the ruthless sorting out of apartheid. Until then, blacks, most of whom came after World War II to work in the new factories, had lived in a central township called Stirtonville or in mine hostels, where they slept in concrete bunks, racked like wine bottles, 48 to a room. In 1964, some 40,000 blacks were uprooted and relocated 10 miles south to a township called Vosloorus, which is now believed to house 250,000 people. Thereafter, blacks came to Boksburg as outsiders, to buy their food and sell their labor. Except for domestic servants and a smattering of middle-class families who have bought into formerly white neighborhoods, they still do. The mixed-race residents known as "coloreds" were collected from around the area and deposited in Stirtonville, now called Reiger Park, population 27,000. Indians were shooed away to nearby Benoni. That left about 87,000 whites as the sole proprietors of Boksburg and the sole beneficiaries of its industrial tax base.
When David Goldblatt, one of South Africa's most respected photographers, set out 14 years ago to document white South Africa, the place he settled on as his Middletown was Boksburg. His pictures show a people smug and secure. The races intersected only in the most formal of contacts -- master-servant, employer-laborer or the patronizing relationship of well-intentioned do-gooders toward the poor natives. Goldblatt's portrayal of all this was so cruelly honest that his book is not stocked in the Boksburg city library.
But the politics of Boksburg took a vicious right turn in the elections of October 1988, when the white supremacists of the Conservative Party won 12 of 20 Council seats. Boksburg was the largest of 104 municipalities in South Africa to fall into Conservative hands.
Many now recall that election as a fluke. The previous Council had been beset by scandals and mismanagement (one councilman was arrested for assaulting his wife with a hammer) and the Conservative Party was well organized to capitalize on the popular backlash.
"On a scale of 1 to 10, liberal to conservative, Boksburg is probably a 5," says Phillip Frankel, a political scientist who has polled extensively in Boksburg. "Its reputation far exceeds the reality. This isn't a town full of Nazis -- no more than most others."
Frankel's polls from the time show that Boksburg's whites were deeply worried by the erosion of the racial barriers that was already under way -- well before F. W. de Klerk had formally repudiated apartheid -- but no more so than whites generally. In reality, Boksburg was, and still is, something of a Middletown, an ordinary place that had somehow elected its anxious id to the City Council. Egged on by the Conservative Party's national leaders, who were thrilled by their victory, the new Boksburg majority set out to make their city the Alamo of apartheid.
At its first meeting, the new Council decreed that it would begin rigorously enforcing the Separate Amenities Act, a by-then largely ignored law that established whites-only toilets, parks and sports facilities.
"The ultimate aim was to show that there are a million right-wing voters who also want to live separately," recalls Beyers de Klerk. "We are not bloody fools. We know you can't wish away the blacks, you can't wish away the coloreds. They're here. But we also feel we have a right to Africa."
As the first Mayor selected by the new majority, and as a member of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, de Klerk enacted the role of frontier patriarch for the world's cameras, discoursing on God's plan for Boksburg and posing with his Bible. Perhaps, he concedes, he made a fool of himself, "but it was good fun."
Not to the city's other residents.
In the mixed-race township, Reiger Park, residents retaliated with a consumer boycott of white merchants in Boksburg. They found enthusiastic corporate support, especially from a number of multinational companies in Boksburg. Companies like Colgate-Palmolive, American Cyanamid and Unilever had opted to remain in South Africa in spite of international sanctions, claiming that they could do more good for South African blacks by staying. Here was a chance to prove it. They provided buses to ferry shoppers to stores in neighboring towns, canceled expansion plans and ran advertisements denouncing the racist Council.
De Klerk's real-estate franchise was singled out for special attention. The first stop on our tour of Boksburg was his comfortable split-level house, which he was forced to sell when the boycott pushed him to the brink of bankruptcy, but later bought back.
"It cost me close to one million rand [about $300,000], that boycott," he says. "I had to sell buildings under cost. I lost the family business. I lost my house and I lost a lot of friends."
By February 1990, when F. W. de Klerk announced plans to repeal all the remaining apartheid statutes, Boksburg had all but surrendered. Later, Beyers de Klerk quit the Conservative Party caucus and declared himself an independent. After the Hani killing, he joined F. W. de Klerk's National Party. It was not inconceivable to him that he might someday take the final step and join the African National Congress.
"My heart tells me one thing," he says, "but my educated brain tells me you cannot have what your heart wants."
To illustrate how he has been chastened, the councilman drives me through the downtown shopping district, blocks of shoe stores and appliance dealers and liquor outlets, to show me the Council's latest achievement "for our black brothers."
In the center of downtown, the city has built a new depot for the minivan taxis that transport "coloreds" from Reiger Park and blacks from Vosloorus. It has shelters for waiting passengers, public toilets and hoses for drivers to wash their vehicles while they wait.
"At the end of the day, I had to stop being a Boere-Boere Mayor and I came back to being a businessman," he says. "It's all rands and cents. We've changed here because we were forced to change."
IN 1991, TOKYO SEXWALE WAS just a year out of jail and rising fast through the political structure of the newly legalized African National Congress. After 15 unsettled years as an exile, an underground A.N.C. operative, a guerrilla warrior and finally a political prisoner, Sexwale was looking for a house. A real-estate agent suggested a middle-class subdivision called Dawn Park, at the southern fringe of Boksburg, in an area still devoted more to cornfields than housing tracts. It was so new it had no schools, no stores or filling stations, no churches. So there were bargains to be had. A few blacks had already moved in since the lifting of the Group Areas Act, which prescribed which races could live where. Sexwale made a down payment on a house in Dawn Park, and a few months later persuaded his closest friend in the A.N.C., Chris Hani, to buy in, too.
"It was a laugh, yes," Sexwale says, recalling the reaction of friends when two of South Africa's most notorious black insurgents moved into the country's most famously right-wing municipality. "But it had nothing to do with politics. Chris was just back from exile, and I was from prison. It was just a place to put our heads down for sleep."
The two men soon found that there was more to Boksburg than its theatrically racist image.
Among Boksburg's blacks, they found that the great boycott had been not only a political victory but a psychological turning point as well. Nonwhites who once moved furtively through town, who stood deferentially aside while shopkeepers waited on white customers, now acted as if they had a right to be there.
More surprising was the reception Hani and Sexwale got from Boksburg's whites. In Dawn Park, they found an openness that was part simple neighborliness, part curiosity, part craving for reassurance, part, Sexwale sensed, shame for the past. "They came to our houses, gave us cakes and cards," he says. When the two black radicals jogged through the suburb, defying the recommendations of their security guards, they were stopped every block by gregarious neighbors.
"We ended up doing very little jogging and a lot of talking," says Sexwale, who is now chairman of the A.N.C. region centered on Johannesburg. "Someone would say: 'I'm a cop. How safe will I be under the new Government?' "
When they ventured downtown or to the East Rand Mall to shop, he says, they were often mobbed by curious whites. Hani, one of the A.N.C.'s biggest celebrities, drew crowds like a Hollywood star. Sexwale, on his outings to the Spur Steak Ranch restaurant, presented an even more astonishing spectacle, because his wife is a white Afrikaner. A few whites glared their disapproval, but most fumbled to act normal or radiated goofy smiles meant to convey acceptance.
When Beyers de Klerk broke with the Conservative Party, Hani sent him a fax congratulating him on his good sense. Sexwale called the councilman on the phone and listened with amusement as de Klerk pitched one of his favorite pipe dreams, bringing the Olympics to Boksburg.
"Beyers is trying to be something, but he's held by the past," Sexwale says. "He epitomizes the confusion within the Afrikaner communty as we see it today: the fear of the future, the guilt for the past, the stubbornness."
Sexwale was among the first on the scene the Saturday morning that Hani was shot in his driveway. He cradled his friend's body and wept. But it never occurred to him, he says, to blame Boksburg for the crime. The neighbor who called in the killer's license number was an Afrikaner. So was the constable who made the arrest. So was the neighbor who fetched a sheet to throw over the body.
In the weeks after Hani was killed, I found only one person who suggested that Boksburg was in some way to blame for the black leader's death. That was Alfred Woodington, the chairman of the Boksburg A.N.C., who said the town was so friendly it caused Hani to let down his guard.
EVERY SCHOOL MORNING A Volkswagen minivan careens through the black township of Vosloorus, collecting teen-agers who stand in the coal-smoke haze wearing trim black uniform blazers and pullovers. The students crowd into the van, chattering above the rhythm of a gospel tape as the driver turns north toward the Boksburg suburb of Sunward Park. They are among the first blacks to be admitted to the white schools of Boksburg, and in the eyes of their hosts they are lucky pioneers of the new South Africa.
But as they answer questions about Boksburg, it becomes clear that this daily voyage is no easier for them than it would be for their white classmates to venture into the black township -- the difference being that no white children ever venture into Vosloorus.
On its way north this day, the minivan passes posters advertising a rally of the racist Afrikaner Resistance Movement. To the black students, the posters scream with the force of pornography. The A.W.B.'s bellicose leader, Eugene TerreBlanche, is a buffoon to many whites, but he looms large in these black teen-agers' image of South Africa, and of Boksburg in particular.
"It's a racist town," declares Nkale Motaung, a 16-year-old who is, if anything, the optimist on the bus.
At school, the white kids -- not most of them, but some, enough to hurt -- call them "kaffirs" and "chocolates." One white boy likes to wear an A.W.B. T-shirt under his uniform and flash it for the black kids when no teachers are looking.
I ask if, after a year and a half at Sunward Park, they have friends among the white students. All but one or two shake their heads.
"Most of them, they don't want to mix with us because we're black," says Molebatsi Tuka.
"They also think we're stupid," chimes in Tshepiso Mokoena. Similar comments tumble from the teen-agers until the van pulls up at Sunward Park. Then the students gather up their book bags and compose themselves into a stoic silence. They assume the European aliases most of them wear for the benefit of white classmates and teachers -- Nkale becomes Charles, Molebatsi turns into Patience -- and they enter the heart of whiteness.
Like most white public schools in South Africa, Sunward Park has become a "Model C" or "state subsidized" school. The state still pays teacher salaries, but a board controlled by the parents now owns the property and raises the remaining expenses through tuition. Technically, schools may not discriminate on the basis of race, but in practice parents control admissions by other means. They can turn away applicants who live outside their immediate area, who fail to pass entrance exams or who cannot afford the fees.
In Sunward Park, an affluent, English-speaking community that votes for F. W. de Klerk's National Party, parents last year decided overwhelmingly to admit black students. But like most whites coping with the collapse of the old barriers, they insisted that integration be on white terms. Black enrollment would be limited to 10 percent, a ratio the school figured would pose no serious threat to academic standards and that could allow the school, as principal David Cawdry put it, "to maintain an ethos."
The black students who commute to Sunward Park have competed for the privilege and they are the cream of Vosloorus, children of serious, motivated families able, often with much scrimping, to pay the $450 in annual fees plus the cost of the daily commute. All the same, the black students come from the other side of the apartheid looking glass. They come, most of them, from underfinanced, overcrowded black schools that teach geography without maps, biology without microscopes, reading without library books -- schools educationally inert but politically charged. They have older brothers and sisters who have lived in exile. All of them know someone who has died or had a house torched in factional violence.
Their politics tend to be African National Congress. Their heroes are Nelson Mandela and Chris Hani. They are, one might think, a treasury of information about the black world where much of South Africa's newly enfranchised majority lives, the world that is about to be merged with Boksburg's world. But this is a resource Sunward Park High has chosen not to tap.
After Chris Hani was murdered three miles away in a suburb that sends many children to Sunward Park High, the school organized no discussion of the event. Black students said the only acknowledgement of the killing was the taunting of white classmates, who joked that Hani, in his concrete-lined grave, would start "an underground movement."
"We know something about Boksburg because we go there to the shops," Nkale Motaung says. "They know nothing about the township, except the misinformation they get from their parents. Even if they pass through, all they see is shacks and they don't know what goes on inside."
Some of the more self-aware white kids are also distressed that the worlds barely touch. "We don't know much about how they live," admits a 16-year-old, Janene Fourie. "We don't know anything. I haven't learned much from the black kids in my school about what it's like in the township. I'm too scared to go there, and nobody ever tells me. I have black friends, but we don't talk about these things. Also there are still racist white kids at Sunward Park, and some of them are my friends, too. I guess I'm afraid of what they would think if saw me getting too serious with the black kids."
ON A NIPPY evening in June, Camille Burger called together the members of the city Planning Committee in the upstairs chamber of the Old Town Hall. The theme of his hour-long presentation was "Quo vadis?" ("Where are you going?"), a Latin phrase much in vogue these days in South Africa.
Burger is the Boksburg town planner, heir to a profession rendered absurdly simple by the social engineers of Grand Apartheid, but now suddenly promising to become very complicated indeed. When he helped draw up Boksburg's latest master plan five years ago, he could readily ignore Reiger Park and Vosloorus. Now there is every chance that by the end of this year the mixed-race residents of Reiger Park and the black multitudes of Vosloorus will be merged with white Boksburg.
Here is where the real battle over South Africa's future will be fought. If whites are intent on maintaining the standards and "ethos" of their schools, not to mention their neighborhoods and hospitals and roads and sewers, then they must be willing to help upgrade the black townships like Vosloorus.
"You can take this plan and throw it out the window," Burger tells the 20 white men who listened attentively. "The playing field has changed."
Burger, a conservative but a realist, readily concedes the absurdity of the "artificial land use pattern" apartheid wrought upon his map.
To the south, for example, are the low-income satellite communities of Windmill Park and Villa Liza, which Boksburg conceived and built in the closing years of the old order. Windmill Park was among the first communities in South Africa to be exempted from racial restrictions, though it was built mainly for "coloreds," people of mixed race. Villa Liza was designed for Indians. Both are tracts of doormat-size lots topped with shabby, look-alike boxes, isolated in the weedy prairie -- far enough from town that transportation costs were sure to eat up the advantages of a cheap mortgage.
Under apartheid, such communities appealed to their intended buyers with a compelling logic: this is the only place available to the likes of you. In the new South Africa, where the market takes over from the Group Areas Act, who would want to live in such places? As the hundreds of vacant lots testify, no one.
"If the private sector had done this, that company would have been bankrupt long ago," Burger tells the Planning Committee.
Another matter not envisioned in the town plan was squatters. It is one of Boksburg's great boasts that the city is unmarred by the shantytowns that encroach on other communities. "No squatter camps!" Beyers de Klerk announced to me half a dozen times as we surveyed the city from his BMW. "We don't allow them!"
I later discovered Boksburg has hundreds of homeless blacks who camp in the mine dumps and industrial wastelands that abut the settled areas. They do not coalesce into communities because when their campsites grow too settled the police come and chase them away, sometimes building bonfires of their Red Cross blankets. But they are there -- Burger's estimate is 1,600 -- and as blacks continue to drop off the edge of a shrinking economy, more will come.
What racial politics created, Burger hopes, economics will preserve for a time, protecting the Boksburgs against being overwhelmed by black expectations. "The Government can scrap a law in a day, but we cannot move a black town the next day to a new, more desirable location," he says. "We cannot, like the politicians, say let's forget about the past. The past is there."
Burger's strategy is containment. He wants to develop a new industrial park across Boksburg's south, just north of Vosloorus, to employ blacks closer to home, and simultaneously provide them with better incomes to upgrade their areas. "It's easier to move one factory than to move 200 families, and factories can afford it," Burger reasons.
He also proposes to provide sites for the homeless in the south, what South Africans call a site-and-service scheme by which the state provides empty sites with water and toilets where the most abject poor can erect their own shelters. This belt of employers and low-income housing sites across the south, he figures, would prevent the city from being engulfed: "The idea is to end up with a plan that is not that strict, but where we will definitely protect vested interests."
Burger understands that in this day of multiracial, multiparty negotiations, such questions will not be decided by a roomful of 20 white men in business suits. The next meeting, he tells them, must be broadened to include black leaders, even militant black leaders. "It's not easy to swallow, but we have to talk with these guys," he says. No one objects.
A few days later, I describe the meeting to Alfred Woodington, the chairman of the local A.N.C. branch, as we chat in his home in Reiger Park. He fumes, spooning sugar into his tea. "I hadn't heard about that meeting," he says. "Who was there?" I tell him. A slow wince passes across his face.
"We'll have to put most of those things on ice," he says. "They have white prints all over them."
But in their thinking about the future of Boksburg, Woodington and Burger are not all that far apart. At first blush, Woodington says, the idea of creating jobs in the south made sense to him. And, somewhat to my surprise, he predicts that in the end most people will remain in neighborhoods with their own people. He describes friends who had moved into white areas only to find they missed the townships.
"In a few years, they will see how uncomfortable it is to live among people they have never lived with before," he says. "You will still have your right-wingers being right-wingers, your racists being racists. Integration will be painful. It already is. In these white areas, there's an uproar when you slaughter a beast, which is traditional. But when it comes to townships, nobody cares whether you keep goats or not. And you can't have a real party in a white area. I mean, when we have a party, we have a party."
TO THE QUESTION "Quo vadis?" Beyers de Klerk sees three possible answers.
"One, you negotiate a shared Government," he says. "If that doesn't work, you emigrate. Or you have a civil war -- boom, two-thirds of the population wiped off the face of South Africa."
De Klerk talks up Option 3, since in Boksburg anything that smacks of optimism marks you as a lily-livered liberal, but he prays for Option 1.
"When they did away with apartheid, I thought the sky would fall," he says. "But I don't think it's that bad. Each one still keeps to his own kind, more or less.
"The thing is, there's still a fear of being ruled as a minority. So you have your elections next April. If the A.N.C. wins, they'll put so much thumb on the rest of us that we're going to have to stand up and fight. If the other guys win, no way the A.N.C. won't fight. As I read it, I can see only chaos."
Tokyo Sexwale, whose job in the A.N.C. consists partly of reassuring whites, says he is sympathetic to white fears, within limits.
"Naturally the mosaic is going to change," he says. "The tempo is going to change. The allocation of resources is going to change. Boksburg will be subject to the dictates of a new Constitution. Yes, there's going to be some pain.
"We will try to ease this new Constitution in, to get people to understand the new ball game. Of course, if what you're getting is not genuine misunderstanding but open revolt, you may have to ram it down their throats."

But even at school, the worlds of the blacks and whites barely touch. When David Goldblatt set out 14 years ago to document white South Africa photographically, he chose Boksburg as his Middletown. Back then, the races rarely intersected. Today, economic realities are breaking down some of the barriers.

He is a separatist by conviction, but as a businessman he knows the price of isolation and has acquiesced in democracy's onslaught -- up to a point.

BYLINE: By LAUREN DAVID PEDEN

 BODY:
In September, Hollywood begins rolling out its highbrow fare. In keeping with this tradition, the Samuel Goldwyn Company is releasing what could be the most challenging movie of the year. "Baraka," which opens Friday, is a wordless paean to what its director, Ron Fricke, calls "humanity's relationship to the eternal."
More specifically, it is a 70-millimeter film that shows -- without benefit of titles -- such sights as the city landfill in Calcutta, Mount Tramserku in the Himalayas, the Helmsley Building on Park Avenue in Manhattan and a factory in Bang Pa-In, Thailand. The movie's title comes from an ancient Sufi word meaning "blessing" or "breath of life"; the director describes the undertaking as "guided meditation." 
 While some of the sequences are self-explanatory (time-lapse footage of pedestrians moving en masse in New York and Tokyo, various religious and tribal ceremonies), others will probably make viewers wonder: Where are we, and what's going on here? It was these questions (asked in a larger context) that prompted Mr. Fricke and the producer Mark Magidson to make the film, which, predictably, posed a marketing challenge.
"I find those kinds of issues interesting to contemplate," says Mr. Magidson, who had collaborated with Mr. Fricke several years ago on another wide-screen, nonverbal project. "How long are our lives, and what's come before us, and what are we doing here? That's what the film is about. Once you start explaining what's going on, it becomes this intellectual experience, like an informational, documentary-type film."
Yes, but will moviegoers find those issues compelling enough to spend 96 wordless minutes listening to New Agey, transcultural music and contemplating their collective navel? Mr. Magidson answers, "If you go to the opera and don't know the story line, you could still find it beautiful . . . hopefully."
The movie is ostensibly about global connectedness, and to capture its we-are-the-world feeling, Mr. Fricke and Mr. Magidson, accompanied by a three-man crew, traveled to 24 countries over a 13-month period. Some of the scenes, like those of Turkish whirling dervishes, were coordinated in advance; others were shot on the spur of the moment.
"We had sections of the film that were blocked in," says Mr. Magidson, "but in most cases we would choose locations based on the weather or local economic factors." In other words, where shooting was cheap.
With their whirlwind itinerary -- which included Tanzania, Brazil, China, Kuwait, Cambodia, New Mexico, Iran and Nepal -- their greatest feats were never losing so much as one suitcase, and never getting sick. Mr. Fricke says, only half-joking, "Pepto-Bismol was really the glue that kept us together."
Mr. Fricke and Mr. Magidson have been working together since 1985, when they joined forces to make "Chronos," done in the large-scale IMAX format. It presented the history of Western civilization through its monuments, such as the Parthenon, Notre Dame and St. Peter's Cathedral. The movie, which cost about $1 million, played for five years in Los Angeles.
But the film makers believed that the IMAX format was too restricting; the screens are found primarily in museums, which limits the audience, and the preferred type of IMAX film is a short documentary, with, needless to say, narration. With "Baraka" Mr. Fricke and Mr. Magidson hope to reach a mass audience through the medium of 70-millimeter film, the same format used for such movies as "Lawrence of Arabia" and, more recently, "Far and Away."
Though he had a grand (albeit hard-to-describe) premise and required only $4 million, Mr. Magidson spent more than five years seeking backers. "It's very hard to finance a film like this based on a written treatment, as you can imagine," he says ruefully. "It's hard to say who's going to want to see this film. It doesn't have sex appeal, or whatever the criterion is for a traditional studio film."
Eventually, he persuaded several independent sources (whom he steadfastly refuses to identify) to support the project. Once the film was completed, it took another year to find a distributor.
So what prompted Samuel Goldwyn to sign on? "That's what we do," says Richard Bornstein, who is in charge of worldwide marketing for the company. "We take chances on projects and people. I think for every specialized film there's a certain segment of the population that says, 'There's no way I'll ever see a movie that has subtitles,' or 'I'm not going to a movie based on Shakespeare.' "
But, he added: "How many people are saying, 'I'm waiting for the next film that doesn't have any words'? It's definitely a marketing challenge."
So far, Goldwyn has targeted several possible audiences: film buffs, college students and what Mr. Bornstein describes as the "general specialized audience who are used to seeing offbeat films."
Goldwyn has also prepared a 35-millimeter version, which will be able to play in more theaters and at a less expensive price. "The logistics of playing only 70-millimeter houses are overwhelmingly expensive," says Mr. Bornstein. The film is opening in two theaters in 70 millimeter, and the following week will open across the country, primarily in 35 millimeter.
"The average Joe may not give it a chance," says Mr. Bornstein, "but there are a whole lot of people out there who aren't the average Joe."

HEADLINE: POP MUSIC;
Latin Music Crosses New Borders

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
As befits a pop music idol whose last record sold more than 4.5 million copies, Luis Miguel chose to do things on a grand scale when it came time to release his new album, "Aries," early this summer. Reporters and disk jockeys from all over the United States and as far away as Argentina were flown here to hear the 23-year-old singer discuss the making of the record (reported to have cost more than $1 million), watch him perform at a pair of sold-out concerts and see the premiere of a lavish, romantic music video, shot in three versions by three different directors.
Three months later, Luis Miguel, now in the midst of an American tour that took him to Madison Square Garden earlier this month and will peak in December with a five-day engagement at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., has proved to be worth every penny of that investment. Some 1.5 million copies of "Aries" have flown out of record stores throughout the Western Hemisphere, and the album's first single, "Ayer," can be heard on radios everywhere Spanish is spoken. Once again, Luis Miguel -- a Mexican born in Puerto Rico of Spanish-Italian parents whose full name is Luis Miguel Gallego -- has been confirmed as Latin heartthrob numero uno, the Julio Iglesias of his generation. 
 Just five years ago, success of such magnitude would have been inconceivable for a Spanish-language performer. But the Latin music business in the United States is being transformed by forces both cultural and commercial, and the lesson has not been lost on the multi-national record companies that have increasingly been making their presence felt in the market.
"This is now a big business," said Jose Behar, president of EMI Latin, a branch of the EMI conglomerate that did not even exist five years ago. "It's no longer a matter of going down to Pico Boulevard" -- a Los Angeles street lined with the mom-and-pop Latin music retail outlets that were once typical of the business -- "and visiting your three customers. This is an age in which it pays to have global vision."
But the success of Luis Miguel and bright new stars like Juan Luis Guerra, Gloria Trevi, Jon Secada, Selena, La Mafia and Jerry Rivera who appeal to a young audience looking for more driving rhythms than the crooners of the past could offer is, Mr. Behar and other industry executives are betting, merely a taste of things to come. Already a formidable market of more than 25 million people, Hispanic consumers in the United States are expected to overtake blacks in the next decade as the nation's largest minority group. Their numbers are being fed by continuing immigration from Latin America, but rising incomes and education levels have also created a young and vibrant bilingual Latino middle class that has billions of dollars to spend and a desire to maintain its cultural roots.
At the same time, growing economic integration with Mexico, culminating in the North American Free Trade Agreement that Congress could vote on this fall, is knitting the North American and Latin American markets closer together. With that has come an international explosion of media outlets, including television networks like Univision and Telemundo and cable channels like the new MTV Latino, designed to carry the process toward its logical conclusion: a single market of more than 400 million people united by a common language and heritage.
"Musically, the Latin American market and the United States Latin market have never been separate, even though the means of communication were divided," said Andre Midani, head of the Latin unit of Warner Music International, the worldwide music division of the Time Warner conglomerate. "Radio, television and the press were always local, and therefore their interests were local. But the taste of the public was universal, and with the advent of media conglomerates, obviously those barriers are fast disappearing. Latin America is at long last truly becoming a continent."
Latin music last year accounted for about $150 million of the $9 billion in records sold in the United States. Growth would be greater, industry executives argue, were it not for the resistance of the mainstream pop market, record stores and record buyers alike, to a style that often seems foreign to them. Nevertheless, Hispanics have proved to be unusually enthusiastic and loyal music consumers.
"On a per capita basis, Latin people all across the board, from Puerto Rico to Mexico, have always been heavier purchasers of music" than the American population at large, said George Zamora, general manager of Sony Discos, the Latin music division of the Japanese entertainment company. Add Latin America, which bought more than $700 million worth of recordings last year, and Spain, and the result is a market that spends a billion dollars a year on records and wants to buy more as its income rises. "As economic prosperity becomes a reality, obviously people are spending more money for their leisure," Mr. Midani noted.
 
The Image Makers
From 'Bad Girls' To Moonlit Beaches
 Many in the industry see MTV Latino as the vehicle that will accelerate that process. The Spanish-language version of the music-video channel is scheduled to begin broadcasting from Miami Beach on Oct. 1, with a format that will mix Spanish with English pop and rock.
"I think it's going to be great, because it'll give us an excuse to produce videos," Jorge Martinez, who works on sales and promotions for BMG Records' Latin division, said. "Right now, we can spend $40,000 on a video, and where do we send it? Maybe to a couple of clubs, and the two major networks, but they don't play videos regularly, so there is a question of getting your money's worth."
For the pop singer and actress Gloria Trevi, whose image as "the Madonna of Mexico" has been fed by her decision to pose for cheesecake calendars, and her BMG label-mate Alejandra Guzman, another performer who cultivates a "bad girl" image, MTV promises to be a major career boost. "She has color, sensuality, talent and good music, everything that MTV calls for," Sergio Rozenblat, general manager of a rival label, WEA Latina, said of Ms. Trevi. "It adds up to a natural for them."
Luis Miguel, with his leading-man good looks, silkily seductive voice and a repertory that runs from romantic boleros to electronic dance-pop, can be expected to loom even larger on the horizon. And Sony's stable of handsome young salsa singers and balladeers, including Rey Ruiz, Jerry Rivera, Chayanne, Ricky Martin and Luis Enrique, is also likely to benefit from exposure on MTV.
"You're going to see a lot of videos with these guys taking romantic walks on the beach with a beautiful girl, complete with lingering kisses," predicted Alfredo Alonso, who is the owner of Radio y Musica, regarded as the main trade journal of the Latin music business.
But Spanish-language radio, traditionally the principal means by which Latin music is promoted, is also changing rapidly and losing its barrio mentality. KLAX-FM became the top-rated station in Los Angeles after shifting in August 1992 to a format called "banda" -- a dance-oriented style that takes brass-heavy Mexican hillbilly music and modernizes it with synthesizers and electric guitars. In San Antonio, KTNX-FM has also become No. 1 in its market with a format that emphasizes more traditional Mexican-based genres.
The striking emergence of KLAX-FM, which two years ago was near the bottom of the ratings, has startled the radio industry and advertisers alike, because the station has attracted a young Hispanic audience that had grown up listening to rock and funk but now seems to be returning to its roots. That phenomenon is sure to hasten the entry of other stations into the Latin music market, especially since Hispanic entrepeneurs are looking to snap up FM stations as they go up for sale.
Thanks to the emergence of singers like Gloria Estefan and a wave of Latino writers and artists whose works have met with commercial success, a Latin influence has already crept into mainstream American culture. But many of the new Latin pop stars reverse that process, often striving for the glossy, dance-oriented sound of 90's Anglo pop by recording in Los Angeles or London with the same studio musicians and producers responsible for the hits at the top of the Billboard charts.
 
The Players
Divvying Up The Territory
 Leading the charge to capitalize on the Latin-music market, not surprisingly, is Sony Discos, the Latin music division of the company that is already a dominating force in every other aspect of entertainment around the world. Traditionally strong in "tropical" music -- the pulsating, eminently danceable salsa and merengue sounds developed by Cubans, Puerto Ricans and Dominicans -- and the pop ballad field that Julio Iglesias and Roberto Carlos exemplify, Sony has broadened its sights by moving into Mexican-based music with groups like La Mafia and even reggae and rap in Spanish. "We're aggressive and will continue to be aggressive, so we can be dominant in our market segment," Mr. Zamora said in an interview at the company's headquarters here.
Each of the other major multinational record companies is also seeking an esthetic and commercial niche. WEA Latina, a division of Time Warner, has Luis Miguel as its big moneymaker, but it has also made a large investment in Spanish-language rock and pop with acts like Mana, Cafe Tacuba, El Tri and Fito Paez. BMG, part of the German Bertelsmann conglomerate that also includes the RCA and Arista labels, has done likewise, signing up groups like Maldita Vecindad and Caifanes and financing a Mexican punk-thrash label called Culebra.
"The beauty of pop and rock is that they are much more universal and not a regional style," said Maribel Schumacher, director of marketing for Latin music at Warner International. "It's difficult to sell salsa on the West Coast or banda music in Miami."
For the smaller independent labels that have traditionally been the backbone of the business, the expansion by the multi-national companies means they must change or be engulfed. Fonovisa and Rodven, for example, both have affiliations with the powerful Mexican television network Televisa, whose programs are broadcast in the United States and 20 other countries but will need all those resources to compete with the major labels.
"The labels have drastically changed their way of thinking and become much more mainstream," said Mr. Alonso, who recently became general manager at WSKQ-FM radio in New York. "They are spending a lot more on advertising, and will send their artists out for radio promotions and tours. You didn't see that four or five years ago."
 
The Doubters
Spanish Is Still A Foreign Language
 Notwithstanding the transformation of the Latin-music industry, important barriers remain in place and show few signs of weakening. Despite the occasional novelty hit in Spanish, like Los Lobos' 1987 version of "La Bamba," the mainstream pop audience in the United States has repeatedly demonstrated that it does not enjoy songs in any language other than English. So while Jerry Rivera can tour Japan, sing only in Spanish and appeal to the same consumer who likes Mariah Carey or Guns 'n' Roses, he cannot do the same on the American mainland. That means a Latin artist's chances for a "crossover" hit, where the really big money is to be made, are much more limited than those of a black performer.
In addition, many record stores, especially those in areas without a large Hispanic population, still resist the idea of setting aside space for Latin music. "The Anglo chains are beginning to realize the magnitude of this market, but they really haven't come to the party the way they could," said Mr. Rozenblat of WEA Latina. Retailers, he continued, still need to be convinced that "you can bring in the consumer by having Latin product. It's no different than a supermarket having Goya foods and Colgate too."
In the face of that reluctance, some Latin performers are focusing their attentions southward, particularly toward Mexico, whose 90 million people account for 40 percent of all the money spent on music in Latin America. La Mafia had been a regional act, its popularity largely confined to Texas, until it began playing concerts and dances all over northern Mexico. Its stepped-up version of traditional Mexican styles appealed to audiences there, and the group sold more than 500,000 copies of its last album in Mexico. That, in turn, sparked interest in the group in California and other parts of the United States with large Mexican-American populations. As a result, even Puerto Rico and South America began to show curiousity about the group.
"We've always felt that the United States is an extension of Mexico, and vice versa," said Mr. Behar of EMI Latin. "Musical tastes are very similar, and a big pop hit in Mexico is likely to be a big pop hit here."
Other Hispanic performers who feel comfortable singing in both English and Spanish are taking another approach, seeking to establish, in the words of the Cuban-born singer Jon Secada, "dual careers." Mr. Secada released his first album, which contained the hit "Just Another Day Without You" and has sold more than five million copies worldwide, in English. He then recorded the same songs again in Spanish and sold another 600,000 copies in the United States and Latin America.
Gloria Estefan made her mark purveying Latin-flavored pop to English-speaking audiences, but recorded her latest album, "Mi Tierra," in Spanish, opting for a sort of reverse crossover. Linda Ronstadt also struck gold with two albums of Mexican mariachi music and one of Caribbean-flavored boleros.
Impressed by Mr. Secada's success, EMI Records is, in fact, encouraging some of its other bilingual artists to record in both languages. Even a few non-Hispanic artists have experimented with that approach, including Bryan Adams, Jon Bon Jovi and Motown's Boyz II Men, who have a Spanish-language single due this month. "To a certain degree, there is always going to be a certain separation between the two markets, but I've had much greater success than anyone could have imagined," Mr. Secada said. "There is still a lot of untapped territory out there, and it is going to become more and more important."

42d Street Plan: Be Bold or Begone!

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:
Forty-Second Street now!, the long-awaited "interim" plan to revive New York's tarnished boulevard of dreams, is a smoothly choreographed step in exactly the right direction. As the word interim suggests, the plan is no more than a step. A decade hence, 42d Street could well be straddled by the kind of gigantic tombstone skyscrapers that were originally planned to rise here. Though a faltering real estate market put that project on hold, it has not vanished from the horizon.
And even the interim plan faces some hurdles before it is officially adopted. The private developers in this public-private venture have yet to approve the plan, and it will be the subject of public hearings this fall. With luck, however, this wonderful plan will be accepted and the ideas percolating through it will influence whatever follows. The plan is important not only because of the historical significance of the site but also because it breaks ground for a fertile exchange between corporate and popular culture. 
 "Main Street is almost all right," Robert Venturi wrote in 1966, and that is the guiding idea behind the 42d Street plan. Mr. Venturi's remark was aimed at modern city planning. He sought to puncture the prevailing assumption that whole streets and neighborhoods should be torn down to make room for urban renewal. Forty-second Street may not be your average Main Street, but it, too, is almost all right. In fact, it is almost fabulous. And the virtue of the interim plan is that it will encourage the dormant genius of the place to shine. The goal of the $20 million plan is not so much to overhaul the street physically as to reconstruct people's perception of it.
And don't think that goal doesn't call for engineering every bit as elaborate as would be needed to rebuild the street from top to bottom. A lot of time, money and public relations have gone into constructing the image of 42d Street as a squalid corridor of horrors that can only be redeemed by ripping it apart. Of course, that image is not unconnected to reality. The decay, crime, drugs, pornography and prostitution are real, and no one thinks that these are civic assets.
Still, even in its most blighted state the street continued to draw people who came to enjoy the bright lights, crowds and budget movie tickets. And it has never been clear that real estate development is the ideal deterrent to squalor or crime. But a deal had been signed, the city and state had made commitments to the developers, and the street's seamier aspects became the continuing pretext for the massive public and private investment. In truth, it was the perceptions of public officials that needed the most extensive renovation. There is no evidence that the public was clamoring to see Times Square and 42d Street remade into a barren office canyon and a tasteful retail mall. Nor is Broadway sufficiently robust to contemplate conversion of the street's theaters into legitimate playhouses.
Forty-second Street Now!, a project of the New York State Urban Development Corporation and the city's Economic Development Corporation, makes one thing clear: public officials have been looking at 42d Street with open eyes. The plan is a very Venturian document. In the spirit of "Learning From Las Vegas," the 1972 study by Mr. Venturi, Denise Scott Brown and Steven Izenour, it could be called Learning From 42d Street. It is not a design but rather a set of design guidelines, extrapolated from an analysis of the street's distinctive features, that must be followed by individual tenants in 34 building sites between Broadway and Eighth Avenue. (Compliance with the guidelines will be enforced by U.D.C.).
The design team, lead by the architect Robert A. M. Stern and the graphic designer Tibor Kalman under the inspired guidance of Rebecca Robertson, a U.D.C. official, state that their goal is to create an "enhanced version" of 42d Street. Their proposals range in scale from the small and practical (open-mesh security grilles over shop windows, to enliven the street at night) to the big and fantastic, like a rooftop "billboard park," a pop rococo fountain gushing ads instead of water.
Overall, the plan is devised to reinforce the street's existing characteristics. The layered accretion of forms over the past century. The mix of styles and scales. The lack of visual coordination. In short, the aim of the plan is to produce a street that looks unplanned. But this seeming paradox is in the very logic of the marketplace itself, here celebrated in all its raucous splendor as a delirious public spectacle.
While master plans typically mandate uniformity, the 42d Street plan prohibits it. Instead of providing commercial tenants with an approved chart of coordinated colors, the plan urges them to chase their own rainbows. Instead of lining the streets with matching theme banners, the plan encourages tenants to create their own spectacular signage. And the plan's emphasis on the diverse and heterogeneous extends to the tenants themselves. It envisions a mix of retail stores (chain shops as well as local entrepreneurs), restaurants at different price ranges, nightclubs and state-of-the-art amusements, like computer golf. Six of the street's nine theaters, to be renovated under the auspices of the New 42d Street, a nonprofit organization, would offer a mix of movies, commercial and nonprofit performance, and rehearsal and television production studios.
The plan does include some unifying features. Theatrical lighting, for example, will play over the upper stories of buildings along the block. Transparent, not tinted, glass is required for shop fronts. Above all, the street will be unified by the prominence given to signs: video screens, painted billboards, theater marquees, faded murals from the past, LED strips, holograms -- an uninterrupted commercial interruption. (If this were any other street, the plan could easily pass for an apocalyptic preview of what things would look like if all public spaces succumbed to privatization.)
Though partly conceived in the spirit of architectural preservation, the plan is also a brake to prevent too much preservation from turning the place into an antiquarian version of itself. Some buildings, such as the Rialto on the northwest corner of Seventh Avenue and 42d Street, will be shorn of shabby accretions, while the ditsy paneling added in the 1950's to the Candler Building, a mid-block office tower, will be retained as an integral part of the urban collage.
The character of 42d Street owes much to the dynamic interplay between fixed forms (theaters, billboards, the news "zipper" sign at One Times Square) and their ephemeral contents (movies, ads, headlines); and the composition of the design team replicated that interaction. While the entire project was a team effort, it is probably fair to credit Mr. Stern with the plan's solid stewardship of the street's architectural heritage, while Mr. Kalman's mission was to insure that the past doesn't clog the flow of fresh pop.
The designers use the analogy of the English garden to describe their strategy of planning a place to look unplanned, but a more apt metaphor might be a supermarket display. Grand Union does not dictate the look of Tide, Pepsi or McIntosh apples, but the management can create a lively atmosphere by keeping the shelves stocked, the floors polished and the produce fresh. If something doesn't sell, move it around, or move it out. The 42d Street plan is about trial and error, not perfection. It is about discovering the scale on which it is possible to take the kind of risks that make a place come alive.
OF COURSE, A PLAN IS A PLAN, even if it calls itself an "unplan." Banners or no banners, an "enhanced" 42d Street may well shock those who have only known the raunchy, unenhanced version. And, for connoisseurs of urban complexity, that earlier version is not something to be casually tossed aside. For some, John Rechy's gritty "City of Night" can arouse a nostalgia as potent as that evoked by Cole Porter's "Love for Sale." The book's anxious ramble with love and death speaks of a city as richly textured as the subconscious, and of a 42d Street where it could be seen that the marketplace embraces bodies as well as pop songs, novels and plots of land. Now "the Deuce" will offer commercial sex only in the denatured form of Calvin Klein's towering simulation of it.
Inevitably, given the history and economics of this project, some will view the entire plan as a gigantic simulation, an ersatz, corporate urbanism similar to Universal Citywalk in Los Angeles. Well, the 42d Street plan is corporate. But in a city where recent real estate development has tended to drive people apart, there is something almost quixotic about the plan's ambition to reunite them beneath the umbrella of popular culture. And at a time when pop's technology (VCR's, Walkmen, virtual reality) tends to reinforce spatial isolation, a public space built on pop is practically a Utopian proposition.
And the fact that the plan is corporate may be the most idealistic thing about it. For it suggests that the corporate and the heterogeneous need not be foes. They can be allies. Indeed, they already are. Five hundred cable stations will bloom not because of altruism but because the expansion will be profitable. Multiculturalism may be the bane of the academy, but in the marketplace it's a boon. Dr. Dre sells records, Amy Tan sells books, and Tibor Kalman wasn't hired by Benetton because they hoped his multi-culti graphics would put the company out of business.
Whatever follows the interim plan ought to build on that idea. The problem with the original Johnson-Burgee designs for the center's four skyscrapers was not that they were corporate but that they had nothing enlightening to say about the modern corporation. They expressed accurately enough its potential for daunting uniformity but left out its capacity for diversity. The interim plan, too, leaves something out of the picture. It creates a place attuned to the diversity of consumers. What Times Square Center could provide is a similarly plugged-in place for the producers.

HEADLINE: The Home-Buying Decision of a Lifetime

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE powerful force of a home sales market substantially below the price levels five or six years ago is asserting itself in the lives of thousands of families in the metropolitan area.
For many who bought starter houses in the middle 80's, the fall in prices has forced the postponement of purchase and relocation decisions that are essential to long-term family well-being. Unable to recover all their equity if they sell, these families are unable to buy and "move up." 
 Yet necessity has led many other families to take what they can get and move on. For those that are selling a house bought before the mid-80's, there may be a significant equity build-up. Even if they must accept a price lower than they would have gotten a few years ago, they may well be purchasing at a price that is lower than it would have been then.
If they are at the stage of life when they find themselves eager to make a long-term housing decision -- choosing a house in which they hope to stay for most of their working years -- the current market presents unusual opportunity.
Mortgage rates are more favorable than at any time in the last 25 years. Buyers have the benefit of wide choice. Availabilities are great in many locations. Some buyers talk of having seen 50 properties before choosing. The house they select may be one they would have found unaffordable a few years ago.
The catchword among brokers and successful buyers and sellers alike is "realism." Realistic pricing is what bring sales, they say. The process of selling and buying may be weighted with vicissitudes and disappointments, but it is also bringing out flexibility in the participants.
"The woman whose home we bought became more realistic," said Elaine Simon, a buyer in Woodmere, L.I. "She came down $70,000. But we as sellers also became more realistic. We were asking $230,000 to $250,000, but we ended up selling for $180,000."
Mrs. Simon and her husband, Donald, closed in February on a center-hall colonial on Midwood Road, having sold a side-hall colonial in Lynbrook. They had lived there for 12 years.
In Larchmont, N.Y., Mark and Elizabeth Liscio tried off and on to sell their three-bedroom Tudor house for a year and a half. "Then we put it back on last spring and settled on a price that we had rejected before," said Mr. Liscio, a banking lawyer in Manhattan. He accepted $385,000. The initial listing price was $425,000.
But the sale made it possible for the Liscios to buy a four-bedroom colonial on Walnut Avenue in the Larchmont Manor neighborhood, where many houses are marketed at $700,000 and more. Mr. Liscio declined to disclose his purchase price, but he said it was almost 20 percent below the seller's asking price. The Liscios and their two young children moved in July.
Interviews with move-up buyers throughout the metropolitan area elicited again and again the theme that the buyers were in search of stability of place, especially during the period when children are in school.
They are selecting, not merely settling, and having selected, struggling to sell their old house.
"We don't want to ever move again," said Michael Levine, a musician who moved in August with his wife, Laura Baer Levine, a magazine art director, and two children into a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath colonial on Mendl Terrace near Watchung Road in Montclair, N.J. The home buying and selling process took a year and a half.
The need to sell their two-family house in North Bergen dominated the process, he said. In September they had an offer and in turn made an offer on a house in Montclair. "Our buyers tried from September to December to get a mortgage but were turned down, and then we had to get out of our deal in Montclair," he said. The contract hinged on the Levines' ability to get a mortgage, which they could not do without selling.
THEN a second offer in North Bergen resusciated the Montclair deal, but the buyer eventually backed out. In June the Levines went into contract with a third buyer who closed in August, giving the couple a "small profit" on a house they had purchased in 1985. The profit didn't include improvement costs.
Mr. Levine said he was struck by the difference between the market when he was looking last, in 1985, and the market today. "Then the market was hot," he said. "There was competition for the house you liked. You couldn't negotiate prices down. Now the buyer has more power. We also learned that the real-estate agent is incredibly important in saving you time and taking care of a lot of little things before the closing." The Levines used Bergdorf Realtors in Montclair.
Another couple who were selecting for the long term also engaged in a lengthy search process. "We wanted to buy a 30-year house," said Elaine Newman. She and her husband, Steven Brill, a lighting designer in Manhattan, looked off and on for three years before closing in July on a nine-room colonial on Old Colony Lane in Great Neck, L.I.
The search perhaps took so long because the couple was choosing a location as well as a house. When buyers know their neighborhood and want to stay within it, decisions can be reached more quickly.
So it was with Philip and Tracey Alampi, a couple in their early 30's living in Glen Ridge, N.J. The Alampis moved five doors away in late August, from a house at 30 Claridge Court to a larger house at 579 Ridgewood Avenue. Mr. Alampi is an accountant in Montclair, the neighboring town. The couple have three children, 4 years old and under.
"I grew up half a mile away," said Mr. Alampi. "It was important to us to stay in town because we want our kids to use these schools." He said he had wandered almost by accident into an open house real-estate brokers were giving even before the house was advertised and found himself in contract within two weeks. The seller, an estate eager to sell, quickly accepted $325,000.
"We priced our own house to sell quickly," Mr. Alampi said. Within two weeks he had accepted $262,000 for his house, he said, after listing it for $269,000. The house had been purchased four years ago for $242,000.
The Alampis are proceeding to invest significantly in their new house, initially in new patio paving, central air-conditioning and the replacement of three of the five bathrooms. The kitchen will be replaced in the spring.
Next to location, the condition of the house is most important in bringing about a sale, many brokers say. Some consider condition of greater importance. "Buyers are very discriminating," said Ilse Appelman of the Appelman-Lerner agency in Great Neck. In that community the average sale time for a well-priced house in good condition is two to three months, she said. But the normal sale time is three to six months.
Michael Stoff, a 37-year optician in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, mentioned "move-in condition" as a factor in leading him and his wife, Paula, to buy a single-family house for $475,000 on Carroll Street, a block away from his shop on Seventh Avenue. The couple moved from the Mill Basin section last month. i
"I walked in the door at 11 A.M. with my broker on a Tuesday morning in July, and I saw the woodwork and I was in awe," he said. "I called my wife, and said, 'Get down here,' and we made an offer that very day.' " An agreement was reached within 48 hours and the couple closed in five weeks.
In the case of Ming Tao and her husband Howard Lam, a database administrator for Salomon Brothers, the state of the market provided an unexpected opportunity to buy a single-family house rather than the two-bedroom Manhattan condominium they had planned on. With help from Mr. Lam's mother they bought a house on Borage Place in the Forest Hills Gardens section of Queens.
"When we first saw the house in the spring of 1992 the price was too high -- $425,000 -- and we didn't even bother to make an offer," she said. But when the price fell below $350,000, they bought. "It was the best of all the houses we had seen since we started looking two years ago." The couple sold a co-op on Bleecker Street six years ago and had been renting ever since.
The quality of local schools is frequently mentioned by move-up buyers as a deciding factor in the housing choices. So it was for Gianni and Tilde Giacche , who moved with their three young children last week into a gray clapboard colonial on Ridgeway Street in Mount Vernon, N.Y. "It was built by the previous owner and it was in mint condition," said Mrs. Giacche. But she also was attracted by the heterogeneity of the Mount Vernon population, and wants her children to be exposed to it in school.
"I GREW up in an affluent upper-class community, in Old Brookville, L.I.," she said. "I'm used to that homogeneity. I opted for something different." Mrs. Giacche's late father was Adolph Mariani, who founded Asti's restaurant in Manhattan, now run by his children.
Stability as a housing goal also has financial implications. It encourages buyers to think in long terms about the financing of the house, and to integrate that planning into other long-term family needs.
With interest rates at about 7 percent, the move-up buyer with sufficient equity from a sale to put into buying the new house may be able to afford the monthly payments of a loan with a 15- rather than a 30-year term, brokers say. "Some people are even taking 10-year loans today," said Gene Russo, president of the Logistics Funding Group, a mortgage brokerage firm in Manhattan.
By paying off the mortgage in 15 years, the family with young children may be in a stronger position to afford college expenses when the time comes. Many homeowners refinancing the mortgages at current lower rates are also reducing the loan period.
But since the monthly payments are lower on a 30-year loan, most purchasers of move-up housing are apparently choosing the longer term. "About 80 percent of the people are going 30 years," said Mr. Russo. Many of these buyers cannot handle the higher payments of a 15-year loan, though some buyers apply additional payments to principal in their 30-year loan in order to pay it off sooner. Other buyers, more interested in the tax deduction than in freeing themselves of debt, also choose the 30-year term, with its longer period of deductible interest payments.
A $200,000 30-year loan at 7 percent interest carries a monthly payment of $1,332. That comes to $479,520 over 30 years, before tax deductions for mortgage interest. With a 15-year loan, probably at a half-point lower rate, or 6 1/2 percent, the monthly payments are $405 a month higher, or $1,742, before tax deductions. But when the loan term ends, in 15 years, the borrower will have paid only $313,560 before tax benefits instead of $479,520, a difference of nearly $166,000.
NEVERTHELESS, most buyers are taking the 30-year loan because they cannot afford the higher monthly payments of shorter-term loans. "In many cases people have almost no equity in the co-ops or condos they're selling," said Patrick MacCarthy, a loan officer in the West Nyack, N.Y., office of Margaretten & Company, a national mortgage banking firm. "Many put only 10 percent down with loans up to $400,000."
For move-up buyers in such Brooklyn areas as Midwood, Mill Basin and Manhattan Beach, the typical pattern is to put 20 to 25 percent equity into the newly bought house and get a mortgage of 75 to 80 percent of value, said Michael Sarrel, of the Mortgage Gallery in Sheepshead Bay. Mortgage lenders can work out detailed financial analyses to show buyers what they can in principle afford, based on various assumptions.
Starting with the assumption that the move-up buyer can make a down payment of $52,000, a buyer with annual household income of $80,000 would normally be able to borrow $210,000 on a 30-year 7 percent loan, making possible the purchase of a house costing about $262,000, according to Joseph Taranto, senior loan officer in the Tarrytown, N.Y., office of Columbia Equities Ltd., a mortgage banking firm. This also assumes annual property taxes of $6,000 and annual insurance costs of $720, he said.
But qualifying for a bank loan by keeping housing debt-to-income ratios within the lender's standards is not the only issue for the buyer. The prudent buyer also must be aware of other housing expenses, not to mention nonhousing costs. Utilities may cost $4,000 a year, and upkeep and maintenance can vary widely, but normally range between $4,000 to $8,000. Adding all these in, total housing costs might come to 45 to 50 percent of gross income, before deductions for mortgage interest and property taxes.
STEVEN BRILL, the lighting designer who bought a house in Great Neck, did his own calculations of affordability on a computer before purchasing. He figures, using assumptions similar to Mr. Taranto's and putting the buyer in an over-all 40 percent tax bracket, that with a 20 percent down payment and a 7 percent 30-year mortgage "a $90,000 income can afford the $300,000 house and the $135,000 income can afford the $450,000 house." This assumes that the buyer in this tax bracket accepts net housing costs of about 30 percent of income.
As for the pace of current sales, it is "not bad" this summer, said Karl E. Case, professor of economics at Welllesley College and a producer of real-estate price indexes. Sales generally are exceeding the levels of the 1990-through-1992 period, although price levels appear stable rather than rising.
Statewide figures for New York from the National Association of Realtors show that total sales of existing single-family homes (including co-ops and condominiums) are running at an annual rate of 134,600 this year, based on second-quarter sales. Last year total sales were 136,000 units. That was up from 127,000 in 1991 and 125,000 in 1990.
In New Jersey, existing single-family home sales are running at a rate of 125,000 for the year, compared with totals of 132,000, 118,000 and 114,000 in 1992, 1991 and 1990, respectively.
Connecticut is showing a pick-up this year. The annual rate is 45,700, based on second-quarter results, compared with sales of 40,000 last year and 37,600 and 34,300 in the two preceding years. There has been a noticeable increase in sales in Fairfield County, and more recently in Hartford and New London Counties, said Chip Kunde, executive director of the state's Board of Realtors in Hartford. "But prices are still going down in some places," he noted.
For the metropolitan area as a whole, the median single-family resale home price in the second quarter was $176,000, up marginally from $175,400 in the second quarter last year, the National Association of Realtors says. Three years ago the median second-quarter price was also $175,400. Six years ago, in 1987, it was $183,000.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Mark Also Rises, Mr. Soros

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to the German mark, even George Soros may have gotten it wrong. In June, the Hungarian-American investor predicted publicly that the German currency was bound to fall. Mr. Soros, who has had a nearly impeccable investing record of late, was joined in his view of the currency's prospects by most economists and speculators.
For a while he was right, but three months later the mark is showing a pronounced strengthening against the dollar. From a low point of about 1.75 to the dollar in late July, the mark was trading at 1.61 to the dollar on Friday. When Mr. Soros made his prediction in June, the mark was at 1.625 to the dollar. 
 In the long run, the logic behind Mr. Soros's prediction -- that Germany would have to lower interest rates substantially to stimulate its moribund economy, and that rates in the United States might even edge upwards -- may well prove correct.
A narrowed interest-rate differential would lead yield-sensitive investors to move out of the German currency, putting downward pressure on its value.
Yet economic events have taken a few sharp turns that not even Mr. Soros could foresee. And while the mark may eventually sink to the levels many prognosticators envisioned earlier this year -- as low as 2 to the dollar -- economists said it was first likely to test 1.56 to the dollar or maybe even higher.
"The interest-rate differential scenario has completely changed around in favor of the D-mark," said Henry Wilkes, the head of foreign exchange trading at Bank Julius Baer in London.
Behind the turnabout are fundamental shifts in the market's expectations for the economies of Germany and the United States. Throughout the first seven months of the year, the consensus was that Germany's economy was in a slide that would require the Bundesbank to reduce rates steadily. But by late summer there was evidence that the worst might be past, and that the economy was poised for recovery, lessening the pressure on the Bundesbank to cut rates.
At the same time, another source of pressure on the Bundesbank was lifted. The near-collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism at the end of July, and the introduction of a substitute system under which the European currencies can float 15 percent either way, gave France and other recession-bound nations freedom to lower their rates without waiting for Bonn.
Freed from the restraints of the monetary system or not, the German central bank made clear that it was in no rush to cut rates while there were still signs of incipient inflation. Not until Sept. 9 did it cut its discount rate by half a point, to 6.25 percent.
While investors were absorbing the news that the German economy might be rebounding sooner than expected and the rate cuts might not come so quickly, they were also seeing signs that the pace of the American recovery was slower than predicted, and that interest rates, far from being pushed up by the Federal Reserve, might have to be cut. With yields low in the United States, and American stocks at high valuations, investment money has been flowing out of the country -- and much of it has gone to Germany, where yields remain relatively high, and the stock market has been booming.
If the shifting economic fundamentals were not enough to strengthen the mark, a key technical factor was also at play. A number of European nations, having drained their foreign-exchange reserves in an unsuccessful attempt to defend their currencies within the Exchange Rate Mechanism this summer, have had to rebuild their mark holdings, pushing the mark even higher.
Within Europe, the mark remains the anchor by which other nations measure their currencies. Despite the near-collapse of the European monetary system, most, including France, have maintained stable exchange-rate policies, even at the cost of keeping rates high and stifling growth.
France, for example, has not reduced its benchmark lending rate since the monetary system crashed in mid-summer, for it is trying to keep the franc trading at a level that is relatively constant, but still well below its old E.R.M. minimum versus the mark. But unemployment is continuing to rise, and business executives and politicians are increasingly asking whether currency stability is worth the pain of high interest rates.
Economists expect France, Belgium and Denmark, among other nations, to change course soon and put its new exchange-rate flexibility to work by cutting rates.
"The European economies are still in recession, and the prospects for 1994 are not that good," Goldman Sachs International said in a report this month. "In response, we would anticipate that Europe's leaders will increasingly come to realize the need to relax their interest rate grip in coming months."
What will happen in Germany is less clear. Chris Turner, an economist with Barclays de Zoette Wedd in London, said the perception that the German economy is past the worst might prove to be premature. If so, the Bundesbank may be forced to cut rates more quickly, and more deeply, than many investors now expect. "We don't think there's been enough loosening yet to guarantee a recovery," Mr. Turner said. "Until you get a few bad economic figures out of Germany to change the market's perceptions, the Deutschemark may well remain strong," he said. "But on a 6- to 12-month view, we're still bearish on the D-mark and are looking for a move back the other way, with the dollar going above 1.75."

HEADLINE: Changing the Fortunes of the Medical Business

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Remember that callous wisecrack about the people the Wall Street crash of 1987 put out of a job? Question: "How do you call a stockbroker?" Answer: "Waiter!" In the 1990's, the unwitting targets of such gallows humor could well be surgeons, hospital workers, health-insurance brokers and pharmaceutical researchers.
Under President Clinton's health proposal, which would light a fire under a number of trends already happening, a lot of Americans in the medical business, many of them well paid, would be looking for new and often less lucrative lines of work, or at least seeing their incomes fall substantially. Others, however, would adroitly seize new opportunities and come out far ahead. 
 While the health proposal will touch all Americans, it most affects the 11 million people who earn their livelihoods in this $900 billion business -- a business that has grown so large that it consumes one in every seven dollars the nation spends and is sometimes referred to as the medical-industrial complex.
The President's plan, which he is expected to announce formally on Wednesday, aims to guarantee comprehensive health coverage for all, control medical costs by reducing waste and excesses in the system, and improve the quality of health care to boot. Mr. Clinton hopes to prove wrong the experts who have argued that it's possible to accomplish any two of those three goals at once but not all three.
Under the proposal, regional "health alliances" -- essentially giant insurance-buying pools -- would collect money from employers and individuals and in return offer them a variety of competing health plans. A National Health Board would control the regional alliances' budgets and prevent them from raising insurance premiums more than a certain amount. At its simplest, the proposal implies a lot of new pressure on medical providers to hold down their costs without sacrificing quality, or lose out to others who do.
While any plan that emerges from Congress next year may bear little resemblance to what Mr. Clinton is proposing, it seems clear that many of the concepts he is endorsing are already here to stay. If some Americans still harbored hopes that the cost-conscious approach known as managed care might be just a bad dream, they likely abandoned them after the President's endorsement.
 
The Physician's Lot
 Among the winners under Mr. Clinton's proposal would be physicians who join a health plan's medical network that assures them a steady stream of patients. The price they pay: a loss of some of their prized autonomy, as medical reviewers scrutinize the way they treat patients and the fees they charge. Those who refuse to play by these rules could be excluded by the health plans, and find it increasingly difficult to find patients. For many resentful physicians, George Orwell was only a decade off in predicting Big Brother would rule in 1984.
Primary care physicians -- family practitioners, internists and pediatricians -- could be big winners, as the "gatekeepers" whose approval is required for referrals to specialists.
By contrast, many medical specialists would be losers as primary-care doctors follow rules that keep the "gates" shut more of the time and some specialists are frozen out by health plans that deal with only a select group of doctors.
Lawyers may also be winners. The new limits on the historically independent practice of medicine could produce many a legal battle. "There are very few losers in this world who aren't going to use whatever legal rights they think they have," said Kirk Johnson, general counsel of the American Medical Association.
Consulting firms also expect to prosper by keeping employers abreast of the latest rules and helping physicians and hospitals play the managed-care game.
Many hospitals, long on empty beds, will be losers. They'll be out of business unless they can ally themselves with the medical networks that increasingly control hospital admissions. But nursing homes and home health care companies could be winners if Congress approves a tax break for long-term care insurance and Federal money to help states pay for more home care.
Pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical-device companies could be losers. They contend that price controls on drugs and limits on overall medical spending would hobble their ability to finance research, which would mean fewer innovative life-saving products.
Then again, most large drug and technology companies have profitable operations in foreign countries that already regulate both spending and prices.
Although medical technology may be set back, computer technology could be a winner. Medical networks are increasingly relying on elaborate software to analyze mountains of medical information. The results are used to determine whether patient care is not only medically appropriate but cost-effective.
Health maintenance organizations have been the model for the managed-care health plans to be offered under the big regional alliances. The big H.M.O.'s seem sure to be winners, unless the Government clamps down on their prices.
Small insurance companies, which do not have enough capital to set up and operate managed-care networks, will lose out, deserted by many of the customers for their traditional health insurance products. Many small health care companies can be expected to pool their resources in alliances and mergers.
Even the five proudly independent teaching hospitals affiliated with the Harvard Medical School are "talking about coming together," said Thomas O. Pyle, the new head of health plans for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. "For those hospitals to even sit and talk about that suggests that the world has changed."
Following is a closer look at some of the winners and losers in a changing medical business.
 
Physicians
Generalists Gain, Specialists Lose
 Family practitioners, internists and pediatricians will be winners. Health maintenance organizations, group medical practices and many hospitals are frantically recruiting them for their networks to serve as gatekeepers who oversee patients' care and refer them to specialists when necessary.
Prosperous medical specialists -- heart surgeons, urologists and radiologists, for example -- would fare less well. Many health care experts say that while there is a shortage of primary-care doctors, there are too many specialists, performing more tests and operations than are medically justified. Cost-conscious medical networks make fewer referrals to specialists and entirely exclude specialists they don't need or want. Those who get lots of work will do so only if they accept discounted fees.
Under the Clinton proposal, some specialists could suffer especially deeply. Not only would certain benefits not be covered under the guaranteed health package, but also their cost would ultimately be taxed as income for the employee receiving the benefits. So demand for such things would fall. Examples: adult eyeglasses, hearing aids and in-vitro fertilization.
Some medical groups are so worried about their prospects that they are selling their offices to investor-owned companies like Caremark International and Phycor Inc., which pay for new buildings and equipment that the doctors will need to compete for managed-care business.
Under the Clinton plan, Government-appointed councils would order more graduate training slots in teaching hospitals for primary-care physicians, and fewer for specialists. There would be a Federal program to encourage specialists with dwindling practices to retrain in primary care.
As managed care spreads, a rapidly growing percentage of physicians are also coming face to face with an unsettling practice called capitation -- receiving a pre-arranged fee for each person enrolled in an H.M.O., rather than a payment for each service rendered. "Capitation is an incentive to provide less care," said Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association. "There are no benign incentives in health care."
 
New Insurers
Medical Networks With Big Dreams
 Big health maintenance organizations are likely winners in a new system in which capitation payments would finance most medical care, replacing traditional fees for each service. Among the H.M.O. businesses likely to gain: those of Aetna, Cigna, FHP, Humana, Kaiser Permanente, Metropolitan Life, New York Life's Sanus unit, Pacificare, Prudential, Qualmed, Takecare, Travelers, United Healthcare and U.S. Healthcare, and big Blue Cross networks including those in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Illinois and Kansas City.
The big H.M.O.'s have already organized large networks of doctors and hospitals, and many have deep pockets to finance expansion.
Smaller or financially shaky health plans are disappearing into mergers with or acquisitions by larger managed-care insurers and hospitals. For example, Humana Inc. recently bought Group Health, a nonprofit H.M.O. in Washington; United Healthcare acquired H.M.O. America of Chicago, and Qualmed Inc. bought Health Net, California's largest for-profit H.M.O.
"H.M.O.'s will do well, with or without reform, unless Washington screws it up with tight price controls," said Mr. Pyle of Metropolitan Life. He criticized the President's proposal to tie increases in health-plan premiums to the general inflation rate. He said tight price controls would stymie efforts to increase quality and cost-effectiveness.
Prodding H.M.O.'s to move faster to improve, consumers and employers will be able to comparison-shop for a health plan on the basis of standardized measures of performance, like how long it takes to get an appointment with a doctor and time spent in the waiting room.
 
Traditional Insurers
Pity Small Firms With Old Ways
 Hundreds of small health insurance companies with tens of thousands of independent insurance salespeople expect to lose their customers for traditional health coverage as managed care gathers steam.
"There are many more sellers than buyers," said Lee Zinzow, an actuary and broker based in Winston-Salem, N.C., who helps small companies sell their traditional major medical insurance lines. "Values have dropped dramatically. The majority are not willing to pay anything at all."
Some of these companies are switching to disability insurance, or planning supplementary policies for features like adult dental care and eyeglasses that would not be covered under the Clinton plan. Others are developing niches that they hope will be overlooked by big independent H.M.O's and the insurers that are strong in managed care. One small company, Medical Benefits Mutual Life, based in Newark, Ohio, is helping rural hospitals "create their own private-label health plans," said Doug Freeman, the president.
 
Hospitals
So Many Beds, So Few Patients
 Many hospitals will be losers. They are already viewed as the most expensive caregivers, where patients go only as a last resort. With more than one-third of their roughly 1 million beds standing empty, hospitals increasingly have to accept hard bargains. As they do with doctors, a growing number of health plans pay the hospitals in their networks a fixed fee for each person covered, sick or well. If the cost of care exceeds that amount, it's the hospital's problem.
Many smaller hospitals face a struggle simply to survive. Some will merge or become partners with others, or be acquired. Chains like Columbia Healthcare typically buy several at a time, seeking to dominate a market. Then they close the least-efficient hospitals and offer doctors incentives like ownership of stock in the remaining hospitals to encourage them to send their patients there.
Trying to make themselves more attractive in the world of managed care, strong hospitals are already creating systems that include walk-in clinics, home care and nursing homes. Henry Ford Health System in Detroit recently announced a partnership with Michigan Blue Cross and Blue Shield, the Mercy hospital chain and several thousand doctors. New York Hospital, the teaching hospital of Cornell University, created a network that includes six hospitals in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens (including Gracie Square Psychiatric), two nursing homes and three outpatient clinics.
Hospitals, which once pampered specialists, are now wooing primary-care physicians with offers of free office space and, in some cases, even acquiring practices. Sutter Health, a Sacramento, Calif.-based hospital group, recently added two large group medical practices.
But not all the news is bad for hospitals. President Clinton's plan to cover 59 million Americans who are either uninsured or inadequately covered could sharply reduce the bad debt that leaves 6 percent of hospital charges unpaid each year, said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.
As hospitals slim down or close, thousands of registered nurses are moving to new jobs in H.M.O.'s, clinics, home-health agencies and nursing homes, where the demand for nurses is growing. The Clinton proposal to make health-education classes and preventive services like immunization shots a standard benefit would mean even more jobs for nurses.
The outlook is much less bright for some of the 3.2 million hospital workers who are not nurses. Some large teaching hospitals like Rush Presbyterian St. Luke's in Chicago have already announced large dismissals.
 
Nursing Services
A Chance, Finally, For More Coverage
 Nursing homes and companies offering home health care could be winners as more people join managed-care networks, in which doctors and nurses move patients from hospitals to less-expensive settings as soon as possible. Under the Clinton proposals, the current Medicare benefits for home or nursing-home care for the disabled and people over 65 after a hospital stay would be extended to people of all ages.
New tax breaks would encourage people to buy private insurance for long-term care for chronic illnesses like Alzheimer's disease.
 
Medical Technology
Hurt by the View That Less Is More
 Tougher times are ahead for makers of medical technology, the overuse of which may account for as much as $135 billion a year in unnecessary health care spending, experts estimate. For example, a study published last week raised questions about the medical value of hundreds of thousands of routine ultrasound checkups for pregnant women, at $200 a test. The list of potential customers for everything from artificial hip joints to million-dollar scanners could shrink from thousands to mere hundreds if the 6,000 hospitals and thousands of physician groups are folded into tightly managed medical networks that control purchasing.
There are already "tremendous pressures" to decrease use of the equipment, said Dr. William Straub, a University of Pittsburgh radiologist who is a senior technology analyst with the Jackson Hole Group of health policy experts. For example, when doctors receive a per capita fee to minister to a group of patients, they can no longer add income by running tests in their own office lab.
There will still be a premium on breakthrough devices like Medtronic Inc.'s new implantable defibrillator to restart faulty hearts, said Mr. Abramowitz, the analyst. And the emerging medical networks will need technology to differentiate themselves from competitors, added Fred Abbey, a partner at Ernst & Young. But they won't be ordering as many machines in a given city.
Cost-effectiveness is the watchword. "Unless you are developing technology that lowers your customers' costs, it will not be accepted in the market, except in very niche circumstances," said John Trani, president of General Electric's GE Medical Systems unit, the world's largest maker of diagnostic imagers. Prices of the company's magnetic resonance scanners have dropped to $800,000 for a basic model, from $2 million for the early, more limited versions in 1985. The company, whose 1992 sales exceeded $3 billion, is urging budget-obsessed buyers to buy extra features for existing scanners or models with fewer bells and whistles.
Official advisory committees in a number of places, including Minnesota, Maine and Rochester, N.Y., are already looking at proposed big-ticketpurchases of equipment in their communities. "Do we really need this?" they are asking. "If so, how many?"
 
Pharmaceuticals
More Customers, Lower Margins
 Most brand-name drug makers are trimming their earnings estimates as a growing number of managed-care buyers insist on discounted prices. But drug-company gloom also has to do with unpromising research pipelines as patents are expiring on blockbuster products.
"The change in the market is private-sector driven," said Paul A. Brooke, a pharmaceutical analyst at Morgan Stanley. He cited managed-care plans that use electronic systems and mail-order pharmacies, both of which routinely order the lowest-priced product.
Makers of generic drugs should thrive, at least until heavy competition rachets down their already narrow profit margins.
The good news for the pharmaceutical companies is the Clinton proposal to add coverage of outpatient drugs for people eligible for Medicare and make the drugs a standard benefit for all health plans, so that they would be tax deductible. The added drug benefits would cover 70 million potential customers.
The bad news in the Clinton proposals is in the cost restraints: 15 percent rebates to the Government on sales to the 30 million Medicare patients, who are the main users of prescriptions. A further rebate would be required on products whose prices rose faster than general inflation. And the Clinton plan proposes a requirement to "negotiate" with Federal officials over the prices of new drugs, under the threat of rejection for Medicare reimbursement.
Fighting criticism that they charge too much, most drug companies are trying to show the cost benefits of their products. Merck & Company, for example, produces numbers to argue that its Proscar treatment for enlarged prostate glands that are not cancerous is an economical alternative to an $8,000 to $10,000 operation.
The big drug makers are also scrambling to develop over-the-counter products, which are not included in most health coverage and so can be sold at whatever price the market will bear. Warner-Lambert and Wellcome P.L.C. are the latest to form a joint venture to share marketing of over-the-counter drugs.
A number of brand-name drug makers also make low-priced generic drugs. And in a move that astonished most analysts, Merck, the world's largest drug maker, announced this summer that it would become a managed-care player by acquiring Medco Containment Services Inc., the largest mail-order pharmacy and discount-drug distributor.
Another loser, at least for now, is biotechnology companies working on new drugs. Uncertainty over where the Government is going on health care has dried up access to capital for these companies, which typically have few cash-generating products to support their research budgets.
 
Consultants
Many Questions, Many to Answer
 Employee-benefits consultants, who occupied a hot corner of the consulting market in the 1980's, are expecting explosive growth in the health care revolution.
Some large firms, including William M. Mercer, Foster Higgins and KPMG Peat Marwick, are offering their managed-care expertise to hospitals and physicians' groups as well as employers -- and plan to do so for regional health alliances promoted by Mr. Clinton.
The American Medical Association is offering an "800" number that members can call for names of 80 consultants eager to be "physician advocates," who could advise doctors on business arrangements many will be making for the first time.
 
Lawyers
New Constraints, More Lawsuits
 Many members of the medical community might end up losers, but many lawyers, particularly in the field of health law, could be winners. The new constraints on a historically independent profession could lead to all kinds of battles.
Alice Gosfield, a Philadelphia lawyer who is a former president of the National Health Lawyers Association, ticked off some of the issues. Lawyers will be called in to advise on business-law and antitrust questions as hospitals and medical groups merge and regional purchasing alliances are formed.
There will also be disputes involving increased efforts to combat fraud and abuse, and over the rights and obligations of small businesses, which would be obliged to buy health insurance for their workers. There will be lawsuits by doctors and hospitals who have been excluded by a health plan. Doctors and hospitals that get low marks on health care "report cards" may claim breach of confidentiality, defamation and unlawful interference with a business. Patients and doctors will sue to get paid for care that a health plan has rejected as inappropriate.
"As large plans exclude physicians or reduce reimbursement or coverage, physicians and patients call lawyers and file lawsuits," said Mr. Johnson of the American Medical Association. "Trial lawyers will come out real well," he added.
Although unhappy patients would have to submit disputes to mediators appointed by each health plan before suing, they could still file malpractice lawsuits seeking unlimited damages for pain and suffering. Legal experts said the system would create even more work for lawyers, who would represent patients in the mediation.

Ford Looks Out for No. 2; G.M. Is on Its Own 

Detroit's auto industry is often seen as a monolith as it deals with unions, say, or Japanese rivals. But that image has less and less to do with reality, a fact made starkly evident in Ford's tentative contract with the U.A.W. last week. The No. 2 auto maker is doing just fine these days, as the union well knew in choosing it to set a bargaining benchmark. Ford gave the union higher wages and pensions, and even as companies nationwide force workers to pay more for health care, Ford will keep footing the whole bill. It did get the union to agree to lower wages for newly hired workers, with the pay gap to last longer. That works fine for Ford, which plans big hiring. But for G.M. -- now under great pressure to accept similar terms -- such a contract would be a disaster. It desperately needs to cut its costs, and the Ford deal gives it no way to do so, because the last thing it could possibly do in the near future is hire anyone.
 
Viacom, Paramount . . . Diller?
 
In an age that almost makes a deity of communications, media companies keep joining forces to get their fingers in every pie. Time and Warner put their acts together several years ago. Then last week came news that Viacom would buy Paramount, the last of the big independent studios, for $8.2 billion -- putting it second only to the $14 billion Time Warner deal. Viacom is a power in cable television, with such channels as MTV and Nickelodeon, and Paramount is all over the place, with publishers and sports teams, as well as movies, so the new company will cover just about every media base. If, that is, the deal happens. These things are never simple, as Time and Warner learned. And sure enough, rumors arose that Barry Diller, head of QVC, might put in his own bid for Paramount now that someone has put the idea in his head. It could become interesting.
 
Gerstner Under a Microscope
 
The Gerstner watch continues. Louis Gerstner has one of the most daunting jobs imaginable -- saving I.B.M. from going the way of its dinosaur cousins -- so every time he sneezes, all eyes shoot to him. Can he do it? Last week he gave a big hint of his vision, creating an executive committee aimed at smoother operations and less bureaucracy. So, it seems, he's not about to remake the company from scratch or sell off big chunks of it. Eight of the 11 panel members, after all, are longtime I.B.M.-ers, so he's doing what he can with what he's got. One interesting note: minicomputers and mainframes will be overseen by a single panel member, a sure sign of the shrinking role of these big machines in a world made tiny by the microchip.
 
Did Kmart Cross the Line?
 
An employer has a legitimate interest in much about its employees' lives -- whether they use drugs, say, or whether they were once convicted as ax-murderers. But there is a line where employers' rights screech to a halt, and workers in Illinois sued Kmart last week, saying the retailer had tromped well across that line. Kmart confirmed that it had hired a detective agency, but insisted that its purpose was to break up a theft ring at a distribution center. But workers contend that the agency's report included things like employee opinions on unions, their fishing habits, who was shopping at (horrors!) Wal-Mart, even who lived with whom. After working hours, one worker said, "it's none of their business."
 
Airlines in Search of a Flight Plan
 
Airlines just can't seem to decide how big they want to be, or how much they should charge to ferry a restless population from city to city to city. Yes, fares are going up, as they must if the big airlines are to stop losing their shirts. But last week the airlines turned around and staged a clearance sale, marking down fall travel as much as 45 percent -- if, of course, you bought your tickets quickly. Beyond that, strategies differ. Delta, United and Continental seem inclined to follow Southwest (funny how often that upstart crops up as a role model) into the world of quick flights, low fares and no frills. But American is sticking to its hub-and-spoke system -- funneling passengers to a hub city, then shuffling and scattering them. American also said last week that it planned 5,000 jobs cuts and a smaller fleet.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Just How 'Green' Is Nafta?
 
On many issues, those who call themselves environmentalists present a fairly united front. Not so with the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has split this movement deeply. Last week the split erupted into a shouting match, with the pact's defenders -- generally big groups like the Environmental Defense Fund -- accusing critics of "feeding off misinformation." For their part, the pact's critics, including the Sierra Club and Greenpeace, say that supporters are too cozy with big business. In a way, it's a trickle-down/trickle-up dispute. Critics insist that the accord would lower environmental standards to accommodate Mexico's economy, while backers say Mexico needs help to deal with its environmental problems. In other words, will a rising lake lift all canoes, or will a falling one ground them? We won't know unless the dam comes down.
 
Israel's Peace Dividend
 
Last week's Mideast truce, if it holds, will, amazingly, end an agonizing chapter in world history. But you know that. Among the unknowns, though, is this: Will Israel's war-weary economy be able to kick its boots off and its heels up? The answer: yes and no. First, one might expect a quick swords-into-plowshares transformation. Not necessarily. For one thing, those swords will still be needed, though for different purposes. In addition, a lot of those swords are American, and Washington may be less inclined to send them to a more peaceful land. But here's where peace will help greatly: in drawing outside investment from nations that, quite understandably, have been leery of putting money into a country constantly at war.
 
Yeltsin Gambles on Reform
 
Boris Yeltsin is apparently putting all his chips on economic reform. Last week, in a surprise move, he brought back Yegor T. Gaidar, the young economist who as Mr. Yeltsin's economic adviser two years ago had pushed strongly for a market economy in Russia. In December Mr. Gaidar was forced out as Acting Prime Minister after strong opposition from conservatives to his radical approach. So for Mr. Yeltsin to bring him back now shows that in spite of the opposition, his mind is set on reform.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY

 
Surprise! Rates Can Go Up, Too
 
Just when it seemed that inflation would be relegated to ancient-history books and interest rates would shrivel nearly to extinction, two reports came along last week to stir things up. Retail sales for July posted their fifth straight rise, and retail prices rose 0.3 percent, and suddenly rates were bounding up again, with 30-year Treasury yields back above 6 percent. Maybe below that level traders get nervous. "I think the train overshot the station at 6 percent," said one economist. "The market is very sensitive."
 
Take a Risk, Pay the Price
 
Some people don't see starting a business as especially risky. You dream a big dream, spend a little money, borrow a lot. If you crash, there's the warm, comforting blanket of bankruptcy. Someone else picks up the bill. But not everyone has it so easy. Some daredevils will soon have to pay, up front, for their gambles. The National Park Service, tired of spending big money to rescue stranded hikers, plans to require mountain climbers and others "who intentionally engage in high-risk recreation" to buy insurance to cover rescues. The first sites: Mount Rainier and Mount McKinley.
 
DeBartolo Looks to the Public
 
Back when interest rates were visible to the naked eye, people put money in banks -- and banks put money in real estate. Then real estate crashed, scaring banks away, and rates crashed, sending people looking for other places to invest. So now, again proving that the shortest distance between points is a straight line, the real estate folks are going right to investors for cash. Last week such dealings hit a peak when the Edward J. DeBartolo shopping center empire announced a $600 million offering to become a real estate investment trust, the biggest REIT ever.
 
Health Reform: It Will Happen
 
It's official. Health care reform has achieved bandwagon status -- for even Bob Dole, so often the pesky Coyote to the Clinton Road Runner, has jumped aboard. Congressional Republicans as well as the American Medical Association vowed last week to help President Clinton fix the health care mess. They have, to be sure, their own ideas: "Our proposal is dramatically different," Mr. Dole said. He would not, for instance, force employers to pay for health care. But it's becoming clearer that it's gotten so bad -- the momentum for change so strong -- that something will be done, that within a year or so all Americans just might be guaranteed medical care. If that really happens, could a cure for the common cold be far behind?
 
Taming the Temple of Glitz
 
Trying to civilize Times Square is a bit like trying to tame a hurricane: it often seems that that temple of gaudiness and filth is a force of nature. A decade ago, the talk was of hulking office towers -- swoop in with cranes, usher in the oh-so-civilized office workers, blast the grime away. That was an unsettling prospect for those who felt an odd attachment to this monument to seediness, and a poor real estate market killed the idea. Last week state and city officials presented their latest vision of 42d Street, of noise and lights and glitter -- and renovation, not razing. "We're going to re-create the old Times Square," Governor Cuomo said. "All that blight, all that obscenity, is going to be gone." Good luck when the hurricane speaks.

HEADLINE: At Work;
Dissecting the 90's Workplace

BYLINE: By Barbara Presley Noble

 BODY:
THE American workplace may not yet be in a nasty and brutish Hobbesian state of nature, but employees know better than anyone else that it is in a disagreeable and unnerving state of turbulence. As a result, says a far-reaching new survey, employees increasingly have doubts about the value of company loyalty and increasingly are putting their own needs and interests above their employers'. Moreover, employees are more and more often willing to trade traditional compensation carrots like wages and benefits for flexibility and autonomy, job characteristics likely to allow them to balance their lives at work and at home.
The startling implication, especially for employers who have been depending on a workforce made tractable by fear: Companies that fail to factor in quality-of-employee-life issues when imposing total quality management or "re-engineering" or any other of the competiveness-enhancing, productivity-improving schemes now popular may gain little but a view of the receding backs of their best people leaving for friendlier premises. 
 "Workers care about the quality of their work environment," said Ellen Galinsky, director of the National Study of the Changing Workforce, the results of which were released earlier this month by the Families and Work Institute in New York.
The study, which researchers plan to repeat every four years, is the most ambitious effort to learn about employee-employer concerns since the Labor Department's 1977 "Quality of Employment Survey," research that is now dated by changes in the American economy.
The new, privately funded research was done last year with a randomly selected national sample of some 3,400 employed men and women. Among the findings:
* Over all, 42 percent of the workers -- the average of workers at small, medium and large companies -- report that they are at companies undergoing downsizing or permanent workforce reductions. At large companies, more than half the workers are in the midst of downsizing, and 40 percent report cuts in the numbers of managers.
* Almost 9 of 10 workers live with family members, and nearly half care for dependents, including children, elderly parents or ailing spouses.
* There are no differences between women and men in the tradeoffs they are willing to make for help with dependent care.
* Despite the flood of women into jobs outside the home, their domestic responsibilities have not changed much. "This is true even in families where women contribute half or more of the family income, and where workers are young," the survey said.
* Younger workers are no more likely to be personally prepared to work in a racially and technically diverse environment than older workers.
* Men and women of color and white women view the chances of advancement for white men as higher than do white men.
* Workers see little difference between male and female managers. However, managers, male or female, with childcare responsibilities are seen as more sympathetic to employees with family-related conflicts. "A good manager can stand in the worker's shoes and in the manager's shoes and come up with a solution," Ms. Galinsky said. "This conflicts with the stereotype that people with kids will be too consumed to do a good job."
* Conflicts between work and family tend to be resolved in favor of the job, usually to the detriment of the family and the worker.
THIS last observation surprised some work-family experts. Companies tend to view their work-family programs as a way to improve productivity by "keeping family problems at bay," Faith Wohl, director of human resource initiatives at Du Pont, said. "I still think it's a problem of productivity. But the workplace itself may be a problem. It may be intensifying the fragility of the family. The worker brings an additional set of problems back into the workplace."
One of the survey's most surprising results is how low salary and benefits rated -- both in the bottom half of 20 possible reasons -- for employees who switched jobs in the last five years. Highest rated were: "Open communication," "effect on personal/family life" and "nature of work." Only 35 percent rated wages as a very important reason for taking the job. One explanation is that the range of salary options for most workers is narrow; another is that workers really do want more control over their destiny and, up to a point, will sacrifice cash to get it.
The research provides evidence that job burnout is widespread, in part because workers forced to make a choice are more likely to sacrifice time for themselves than time for work and family. "Carving out some time for oneself represents an investment in mental health and well-being that may well offset occasional or modest reductions in attention to work and family," the report said.
In other words, steal away for an hour or two once in awhile and don't even think about feeling guilty.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
At This Taystee, Opportunity Rises

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
For many New Yorkers, the name Taystee conjures up the Flushing bakery vacated in July 1992. But 14 years earlier, the bread company left its factory on West 126th Street, a complex now at the heart of a project to assist small businesses in Harlem.
Under an "incubator" plan for fledgling businesses sponsored by the Harlem Restoration Project, three buildings between Amsterdam and Morningside Avenues that were part of the Taystee factory will be remodeled to house 40 small manufacturing and service businesses, from clothing designers and building contractors to artisans and accountants. The buildings are to offer low rents (about $800 a month) and meeting rooms, office machines and even clerical help. 
 In addition, the Harlem Small Business Center at Pace University will provide counseling and hands-on help with business plans, financial packages and management. The center will also move to the site from the State Office Building.
Most of the plans come from a survey of 400 small businesses in Harlem. The buildings' financing -- $5.2 million -- comes from public and private sources.
Despite the trend toward service-oriented business, Mr. Schwartz says the restoration project wants to encourage manufacturers because they tend to create more jobs.
The Harlem Restoration Project bought the former Taystee buildings in 1980 and built its office and a thrift shop in a former Taystee outlet for day-old bread on 125th Street. The group rented out some of the empty factory space to local businesses, and so, for the next few months, they will be cleaning their former tenants' debris so that construction can begin early next year.
Although he does not expect the building to be completed until 1995, Mr. Schwartz plans to begin recruiting tenants. So far, a dried-flower arranger, a children's book publisher, and importers of electric buses and exotic African woods have expressed interest. Anyone can apply, but applicants will be reviewed by a board to insure that their plans are sound and that they will be adding jobs to the area. EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
The Next Tidal Wave? Some Call It 'Social Computing'

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
PERHAPS without knowing exactly what it will all mean, everyone seems to be talking about the impending convergence of computer networks, groupware, telephone services, handheld electronic devices, cable television, the Internet and other on-line information services, mixed in with the entertainment industry, traditional news media and other communications technologies.
Such was the buzz last week in Boston at Forrester Research Inc.'s Technology Forum, where business executives gathered to exchange ideas about what they called social computing. Social computing, a communications-rich brew, is expected to create new ways for businesses and their customers to communicate, over new types of wireless as well as wired pathways, using new types of computers called personal communicators. The rise of social computing is expected to shift the emphasis of computing devices away from simple number crunching and data base management to wider-ranging forms of business communications. 
 "Within five years," said William M. Bluestein, a senior analyst with Forrester, "a barrage of new technologies will radically change your relationship with customers, product features and service delivery, and the structure of manufacturing, sales, service and distribution."
"A technological shock wave is about to strike society and the workplace," Mr. Bluestein said. "In the last six months, computer hardware manufacturers, software providers, cable TV operators, and phone companies have been caught up in a frenzied mating dance."
Of course, we've heard all this sort of breathless rhetoric before, and we've seen that some companies are not very good dancers. But Forrester, which is often given credit for coining the term and defining the idea of client-server computing back in 1987, sees social computing as the next big wave. Where client-server broke away from mainframe-based systems and distributed computing power to everyone in the organization, social computing goes the next step and, riding atop client server for a while, extends the distribution of computing power to a company's customers and suppliers.
The word social is important, the Forrester executives believe, because the same technologies that will enable better communication between companies and their workers will also spread rapidly to the consumers of a given company's products and services.
One way to think about this new era is to think of the past. The history of computing in businesses started with a giant central mainframe and has inexorably moved outward, to the department, to the desktop, to the briefcase. Computers have gotten smaller and cheaper and more powerful along the way. It is difficult to construct a scenario that would change this relentless move outward from the core of the business. Taken to the next step -- and this is what social computing is all about -- the computing power will move into the pockets of the workers and eventually into the homes and pockets of the customers.
Another way to look at this era is to forget the past. Forget Citibank's horrible experience with home banking. Forget the shop-at-home-via-cable TV networks, even though it's a $2 billion business already. Forget even such recent services as paying bills by computer, even though it is a billion-dollar business.
Instead, think of Federal Express and U.P.S., which are already involved with computing systems that enable a worker to encode and track packages from hand-held, wireless computers. Think of movie theaters in Boston that earlier this year sold 40 percent of their tickets to big hits by telephone, using touch-tone services.
Think about the way you want to work with other businesses. If you're shopping for a car, you can already log on to Compuserve, request a printout of the make and model you're considering, and get a printout of the actual dealer invoice from the factory.
Some rudimentary examples of social computing are already beginning to appear, and it's not too early to start thinking about how this big cloud of gas will affect your company when it coalesces into a star.
Colin Crook, senior technology officer of Citibank N.A./Citicorp in New York, noted in a presentation at the gathering that formidable barriers must be overcome for social computing to take hold.
The hurdles are regulatory (the Government has to determine whether the pathways are public or private, and who gets the bandwidth), legal (in the form of copyrights), financial (how is the cost of the new services to be shared?), cultural (if you can't program your VCR, why would you buy insurance over a wireless Newton Message Pad?), and, of course, technical (Apple won't even let me touch a Message Pad until I've flown to California for a few hours of indoctrination, which is hardly a good sign for something that is supposed to be a consumer product).
"A lot of technology planets have to come into line before this will happen," acknowledged John C. McCarthy, head of technology research for Forrester. But in recent weeks what seemed like a hydra of disconnected activity now appears to be converging, including new types of telephones, television, handheld electronic devices and wireless and traditional networked services.
Before long, the proponents of social computing contend, companies will routinely exchange information with suppliers and manufacturers using a combination of private and public information networks. Customers will gather information, place orders and handle purchase orders and invoices electronically.
On a retail level, businesses will offer their products and services over the emerging social computing network. Forrester says some companies are already aggressively developing services for interactive television, smart telephones and wireless personal communicators, citing such well-known names as ABC News, A.T.&T., Home Box Office, Mastercard International, Newsweek, Sony and United Parcel Service.
Forrester says it has identified many more companies -- hotels, airlines, financial houses, insurance companies and so on -- that are quietly developing services for these new devices and networks. Such companies are keeping a low profile, the researchers said, in part because they see how these technologies have given a huge competitive advantage to pioneers including Federal Express and U.P.S.
On the consumer level, if and when the proper networks fall into place, information is likely to be available electronically for a broad range of products, including household appliances, vacations, computers and software, furniture, insurance, clothing ("you're tuned to the L.L. Bean Channel") and perhaps even homes (you've been transferred to Seattle and want to see some houses before flying out to meet the real estate agent).
The consensus among the executives at the Forrester conference, who included John Sculley of Apple Computer, George M.C. Fisher of Motorola and Robert M. Kavner of A.T.&T., is that it will be 1996 or 1997 before the regulatory and technical hurdles are cleared for truly widespread social computing.
But companies can certainly begin taking steps now to prepare for the era.

Flower District Is Staying, After All

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
Plans to transplant Manhattan's Flower District to the Bronx, with the city's help, have stalled.
Complaining of congestion and other problems in Manhattan, the four largest flower wholesalers announced at the beginning of the year that they would move to an abandoned rail yard in the South Bronx. The city offered grants and tax credits for the move, and the rest of the $70 million flower industry was expected to be swept into the Bronx. 
 But none of the other 14 wholesalers signed on, and one of the original four dropped out of the project.
That wholesaler, Mitchell Vlachos, said that 28th Street was a major hub and that "moving to the Bronx would mean sacrificing clients in Brooklyn, Manhattan -- especially Wall Street -- South Jersey and Staten Island."
Many people did not know how their employees could go to work at 4 A.M. on public transportation, he said. "Above all, people weren't ready to make such a drastic change, particularly in these tight economic times."
While admitting that the Bronx deal had problems, Victor Rallis, the leader of the original group of four wholesalers, said he still hoped to leave Manhattan.
But the other wholesalers and most retailers have formed a vigorous lobbying group, the Floral Industry Association, with help from City Councilman Thomas K. Duane.
"What we're telling the city is, you've got to recognize that the flower industry is a vital sector and gives us basic support," said Jim Weisse, the vice president of the floral association. "There are a number of real options in Manhattan." Immediate requirements include additional parking, friendlier traffic enforcement and more security, Mr. Duane said.
So very early one morning last week, Wallace L. Ford 2d, Commissioner of Business Services, led a cortege of officials from several city agencies through the maze of exotic flowers and greenery, buyers and sellers, tourists, and doubled-parked trucks, vans and cars that clogged the area along 28th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway and along the Avenue of the Americas between 26th and 29th Streets.
"I wanted to get a firsthand sense of traffic, security, sanitation and environmental problems at peak trading time," Mr. Ford said. The purpose of the outing, he said, was to see if a task force should be established to help the Flower Market at peak hours. The commission runs such a task force at the Fulton Fish Market.
And Mr. Duane said the Flower District may eventually move -- but not far. He said there were potential sites around Houston Street. MARVINE HOWE

In the Rag Trade, They Also Serve Who Pleat

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
THE BUSINESS of putting pleats into skirts, dresses and sleeves is under siege. The aggressor? In a word, pants. "There's nothing worse for pleating than pants," Anthony Bonanno, owner of the S.F. Pleating and Stitching Company in Brooklyn, said gravely.
In the rag trade, people read hemlines the way fortune tellers read tea leaves. Sudden changes, in this case up or down, bode ill for business. But even worse for the handful of pleaters still in operation these days are the mixed messages designers have sent over the last few seasons. The ambiguity -- is the style long or short or a hybrid? -- has left women standing on the sidelines in pants. 
 The resurgence of the pant and its impact on the pleating business is a measure of how fickle business can be for those serving New York's garment industry. As critical as they are, no businesses are buffeted more by fashion trends and economic weakness than "findings," the collective name for the small businesses that supply apparel makers with everything from buttons and zippers to elaborate embroidery, stitching and pleats.
For the most part, the apparel manufacturers lining Seventh Avenue and Broadway are really assemblers of pieces and parts. They select fabric woven by someone else and hire contractors to cut it, others to sew it, and still others to finish it, press it and pleat it. "The only reason there's any apparel business left at all in New York City is because of the findings industry," said Bud Konheim, president of Nicole Miller. "The common perception is that a dress is two pieces of fabric sewn together. The reality is that 67 pieces and processes went into it."
When zippers become popular, purveyors of buttons and buttonholes go out of business. When boning is in favor, those who sell elastic tighten their belts. And when pants start becoming feminine staples, pleaters hunker down to wait for women to liberate their legs.
"If it's not one thing, it's another," said Robert Meyer, sales manager of Stanley Stitching and Pleating, which was founded by his father, Stanley, in 1957.
Or as his competitor Mr. Bonanno puts it, "Either way it's crazy. It's crazy when it's busy because you've got to get it out faster than you possibly can. Or it's crazy because you haven't got enough business and you've got to manage your overhead, and everybody's singing the blues and trying to squeeze you for something. That's the kind of crazy it is right now."
Pleating is one of the few businesses left in the garment industry that has not been overtaken by technology. It still largely involves labor-intensive handiwork -- detailed calculations, pattern-making skills and folding the pattern into an accordion.
Where machines are used, mostly to press tiny pleats like mushroom, crystal or Fortuni (made famous by the designer Mary McFadden) into fabric, workers are still required to feed them with fibrous paper and material. Skill is needed to change the machines' settings to accommodate, say, georgette instead of silk, and it can take anywhere from 10 minutes to two hours.
"Machine pleating is more expensive and requires many fine-tunings," said James Pi, owner of Sew Fine Associates, a pleating business on West 38th Street in Manhattan.
The bundles of cut pieces stacked in Mr. Pi's shop are hand-pleated in long cardboard patterns -- two interlocking pieces between which fabric is sandwiched. More than 3,000 patterns for over 200 different pleat widths are tucked into makeshift shelves.
To make a pleat, workers spread a length of fabric over the bottom half of a pattern, which looks like an open handmade fan. The fabric is laid out smoothly, then the top half is laid over it and secured with weights. A worker gently nudges one end of the pattern so that it slides up like an accordion, top into bottom, securing the fabric between. The pattern with the fabric pinched inside is then rolled up in yet more stiff paper and put into a steam bath or autoclave for anywhere from 3 to 30 minutes. It is removed and dried, and when the fabric emerges from the rolled-up pattern, it is pleated.
Mr. Pi, one of the few pleaters who is busy these days, has actually had to subcontract out some work. Mr. Bonanno is also churning out machine pleats for lingerie and fancy evening dresses. He has a large order for the latest rage in fashion: long, flowing skirts in floral fabric stamped with narrow "broom twist" pleats, which are twisted and tied while drying. The result are pleats that look as if they've been slept in; they were big sellers this summer, and retailers are reordering them in ocher tones for the fall.
STILL, business isn't what it was three years ago, when every woman in America seemed to want at least one pleated skirt in her wardrobe. Then, Seventh Avenue kept 25 shops busy pleating garments. Now there are about 15 shops, and although no one has any idea what revenues are for the industry, only six or seven shops are said to have steady work. Mr. Bonanno estimates that pleating runs in seven-year cycles, which means three or four more years before their shops are humming.
As apparel manufacturers shifted production overseas in the late 1970's and early 1980's, many pleating shops in the garment district went out of business. But those who have stayed alive are hoping that the trend toward manufacturing closer to home will reverse the decline.
Some are also offering clients other services, like tucking, finishing, stitching or assembly. Mr. Meyer has expanded into embroidery, which is enjoying a resurgence. "To have stayed in the pleating and stitching business only would have been like suicide," he said. "So we've invested in new equipment and gone into embroideries. Hopefuly, when embroidery slows down, stitching and pleating will pick up."
Still, Mr. Meyer said he hoped it didn't pick up so much that competition increases. "On the one hand, I hate being under the gun," he said. "But on the other hand, let it stay. Right now, I'm one of the only games in town."

HEADLINE: Ownership In a Recession

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your article on the "Trials of Home Ownership in a Recession" (Aug. 8) very nicely highlights the financing problem "negative equity" creates for owners of co-op apartments.
But there is a tangential, perhaps more serious, problem in a building where the units are not substantially sold and where the underlying mortgage is coming due -- the reluctance of lenders to refinance underlying mortgages where a large number of units are owned by sponsors or investors. 
 Lenders are concerned that such units, which are rent stabilized, probably are not able to earn enough in rental income to cover maintenance and financing costs. This endangers the financial viability of the co-op corporation -- and, of course, directly impacts on the ability of a unit owner to obtain a loan for his or her individual unit. Without the ability to obtain such financing, all sales in a co-op building will virtually come to a halt. Literally hundreds of co-op apartment buildings in New York are confronted by this problem.

This Time, Race Is A Murkier Issue

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
NEARLY four years ago, David N. Dinkins took office as the first black man to lead New York City, winning by just two percentage points but pledging to be "the Mayor of all the people." Today, it is increasingly clear that not nearly all the people want him to remain in power.
In 1989, Mr. Dinkins was a triumphant challenger who brought New York's politics in line with its demographics: It was the last of the country's 10 largest cities to elect a black, Hispanic or female mayor. Now he is a wounded incumbent, struggling to keep from being the first black mayor of a major American city to lose his first re-election bid. 
 What happened?
The short answer is: not much. To be sure, Mr. Dinkins has been dented by a bruising recession that has repeatedly forced him to allocate losses and steer a listing ship, not sail on healing waters -- the promise that helped elect him. But he is also confronting the same demographic, political and personal dynamics that made it so hard for him to win last time against Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican former prosecutor, who is running again and, this time, leading in some polls.
Polls also now show New Yorkers more pessimistic about the state of race relations and about any mayor's ability to improve them. And while most New Yorkers believe Mr. Dinkins is more likely to treat all groups fairly, he has been loudly accused of siding with blacks in several charged incidents, from clashes between blacks and Hasidic Jews in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, to the black-led boycott of a Korean-owned grocery.
"I don't think most people really feel he's delivered on his promise," said Thomas H. Kessner, a historian at the City University Graduate Center. "But then again, how does one transcend race when race played such an important role in defining who you are, and in defining the country and the city?"
It is no accident that Mr. Dinkins won by the closest margin in a New York mayoral race since 1905. For while non-Hispanic whites are no longer a majority of the city's population, exit polls suggest that they are a bit more than half the voters in a typical election, while blacks are less than a third. That means no one racial or ethnic group can assure the election of its candidate, but also that black candidates have a particularly tough time.
Democrats nominally outnumber Republicans 5 to 1, but have often switched sides when the issues were race and liberal ideology.
Last week, Mr. Dinkins won easy renomination in a desultory primary -- the turnout was the lowest for such a race since World War II. But in white conservative neighborhoods where he has never been popular, Roy E. Innis, the black chairman of the Congress of Racial Equality who is a conservative on gun control and favors arresting panhandlers, got 25 percent of the vote. That was seen as a sign of the intensity of anti-Dinkins feeling, though he did better than he did four years ago in some liberal white areas he badly needs.
Polls show that Mr. Giuliani, his prosecutor's image softened by a media campaign portraying him as a warm family man and inveterate Yankees fan, has made big inroads among the liberal whites and Hispanic voters who were vital to Mr. Dinkins's 1989 victory on a promise to heal the city's racial bitterness after 12 years of the fractious Edward I. Koch.
"Four years ago, there was a sense of 'He's a decent guy, let's give him a chance,' " Andrew Hacker, a professor of political science at Queens College, said of Mr. Dinkins. "You could almost hear the sigh of relief: 'Thank God the black people have come up with such a dignified guy.'
"But he just hasn't been able to solidify his coalition," he added. "We liked the idea of his being a gentleman. But gentleman just wasn't enough."
That and deep budget problems have helped Mr. Giuliani frame this election as a referendum on who is the best manager, a strategy that tries to give voters a race-free excuse for voting against Mr. Dinkins. Meanwhile, Mr. Dinkins cannot count on another high turnout among the black voters who were energized by his first-time candidacy and Jesse Jackson's 1988 Presidential bid.
The twist is that Mr. Dinkins -- in contrast with other cities' mayors who made a point of acting as spokesmen for black aspirations -- won precisely because of his low-key approach to racial pride. And in office, he has changed his style not one iota. Moreover, he has managed some real successes in the face of the recession. He has kept the city's budget balanced (as required by law), won new taxes to hire thousands of police officers, extended library hours and seen crime decline.
"It's not a bad record, considering the horrible circumstances," one of his advisers said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "To be frank, if the city had known what he'd face, I'm not sure they'd have elected him, because this is not what he was elected to do."
As a campaign slogan, that would sound a bit like "You sweat less than any fat person I ever danced with." But Mr. Giuliani has been notably gauzy about just what he would do differently, and the Dinkins camp hopes the Mayor will do better when he's not running against the "perfect mayor" ideal.
Black mayors have given way to white ones in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Chicago, though because of death or retirements, not defeats. The stakes are high for black New Yorkers' political aspirations since black population growth is declining here relative to that of other minorities. Most experts foresee a future of shifting coalitions, in which various ethnic groups take turns in power.
If Mr. Giuliani is elected, that could change,depending on how he wins, and performs.
"It may well be that the electorate that Giuliani puts together could last for the next dozen years," Professor Hacker said. "I don't think there's a large enough critical mass of white liberals out there to assure the election of a black candidate, and it's not clear where one would come from."

Good Economics Meet Protective Politics

BYLINE: By DAVID ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
"THIS is a debate," President Clinton said at the White House last week, launching his campaign for Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, "about whether we will embrace change and create the jobs of tomorrow, or try to resist those changes, hoping we can preserve the economic structure of yesterday."
That was the Bill Clinton talking who has mastered the fundamentals of economics like no other President in the 20th century. But good economics are not necessarily good politics. On no other issue before the country is there such dissonance between scholars and politicians. 
 Since the time of Adam Smith more than 200 years ago, Western economists have been trained in the principle that unrestricted trade is the best policy. On paper it is. When all the benefits and all the drawbacks are set side by side, free trade comes out ahead in almost every circumstance. Three hundred economists representing almost every point on the ideological compass have signed a letter to Mr. Clinton supporting the agreement, which would remove all trade barriers between the United States, Canada and Mexico over the next 10 years.
But the accord is in serious trouble in Congress, because politics is fueled by votes, not theories. The voters who think they might be harmed are much louder and better organized than the proponents. That is because the disadvantages of the trade pact would be concentrated and felt immediately. The advantages, while probably greater in the aggregate, would be diffuse and incremental. The potential losers have names and faces and jobs. The prospective winners, for the most part, do not even know who they are.
Asked why so many of his usual allies in Congress are opposed to the trade agreement, Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, who is a strong advocate, said in an interview, "What you lose is always more vivid than what you gain."
Consider what happened in Massachusetts. For a century, it was the center of textile manufacturing in this country. Then, in the 1920's, the textile companies moved South in search of cheaper, nonunion labor. Gradually, the state's economy was transformed into the one based on high technology that exists today.
By every measure, Massachusetts is much more prosperous now. Per capita income, now the third highest in country after Connecticut and New Jersey, has more than tripled since the late 1920's after adjustments for inflation. But the promise of prosperity two generations down the road would hardly have been solace to the thousands of textile workers who saw their jobs disappear or to the politicians they elected. 
The opposition to the North American Free Trade Agreement among manufacturing workers and the unions and politicians representing them is grounded in the fear that their factories will shut down like those in Massachusetts did, that their jobs will go to the cheaper, nonunion labor in Mexico and that their towns in the 21st century will resemble Massachusetts towns like Lawrence and Fall River, which never recovered. This anxiety is what brought Ross Perot and so many protesters to a rally yesterday in Lansing, Mich.
Economists say these factories will close and the manufacturing jobs will go abroad regardless of whether the trade pact is approved. No doubt they are right. But this inevitability makes it harder rather than easier for politicians to vote for the trade agreement.
If the accord does go into effect, then for years to come it will be blamed, fairly or not, every time a plant closes. The politicians who voted for the agreement will be held accountable for the job losses. By contrast, no one who plans to vote against the agreement believes the vote will jeopardize his or her re-election.
So where does this leave Mr. Clinton? In many political respects, his support of the free-trade measure, which was negotiated by George Bush, represents one of the most courageous acts of his young Presidency. He did not back down or compromise in the face of political opposition the way he did on the budget, on gays in the military and on help for the Muslims in Bosnia. He is opposed by most politicians in his own party. He could have set the measure aside, saying he wanted to devote his entire attention to health care. But having decided on the basis of his grasp of economics that the agreement was best for the country, the President has not wavered. In his speech at the White House Tuesday and on a trip to New Orleans the next day, Mr. Clinton promised to go all out to win Congressional approval.
He may well fail. A small but solid majority of Senators -- most of the Republicans and a handful of Democrats -- seems prepared to support the President, but they may never get to vote. The Constitution requires legislation involving tariffs to be considered first by the House of Representatives. There, as matters stand now, the Clinton side is dozens of votes short.
Mr. Clinton has promised measures to retrain workers who lose their jobs, but that was not what he and the members of his Cabinet who testified before Congress last week emphasized. Money does not seem to be available for an expensive retraining program.
Instead, Mr. Clinton and his advisers argued that the pact would create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. On talk shows, Mr. Perot responded that it would throw more than 5 million Americans out of work, destroy the American middle class and cause the country's tax base to collapse.
Economists see such claims as sheer hyperbole. No mainstream economist is predicting a gain or loss of more than a few hundred thousand jobs by the end of the decade -- a mere blip to economists in a country with 104 million workers, 18 million of them in manufacturing.
But again, politicians are parochial. Four hundred thousand jobs may mean nothing to a macroeconomist. No Congressman would vote for a measure that lost 10,000 jobs in his district.
Even more important to the politicians, and trivial to most economists, is the way the trade agreement seems somehow to stand for the creeping erosion of the assembly-line jobs that were once the cornerstone of the American middle class. "Nafta has become a symbol for other things," said Senator Bradley, "a lightning rod for people's anxieties about changes in their lives they have no control over."

Having the Dream Is Hard. Living It Is Harder.

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EVER since Franklin D. Roosevelt mused, at the height of World War II, that he might someday try to make peace between Jews and Arabs, every American President has fantasized about his own chances of reaching that goal.
Now it's Bill Clinton's turn to dream. 
 Last week, the President was present at the creation of a new Middle East. With arms outstretched like a graceful impresario, he coaxed Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasir Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin into a handshake that sealed their awkward reconciliation.
"It feels like a gift to me," Mr. Clinton said of this first agreement between Palestinians and Jews, in an interview two days before the ceremony. "I felt that it was in the stars, sort of, but I couldn't imagine how."
A gift perhaps, but also a burden.
The American imprimatur that he put on this quest for peace is the diplomatic equivalent of flying American flags on Kuwaiti ships to protect them against attack during the Iran-Iraq war. It commits the United States to the process, legitimizes it, helps insure international support and bolsters the confidence of the signatories. And it includes the United States among the risk-takers.
But how different this is from Camp David. Then, Jimmy Carter spent 13 days with Menachem Begin and Anwar el-Sadat, negotiating a peace that sprang from a personal conviction that if America could overcome hatreds between blacks and whites, it could craft compromises for Arabs and Jews. Mr. Clinton, by contrast, is to the Middle East what George Bush was to the fall of Communism: The events unfolded, serendipitously, after previous Administrations laid the groundwork.
In making foreign policy -- not Mr. Clinton's strong suit, at least not yet -- the President likes to play to his strengths. So it is not surprising that his first public appearance after the signing ceremony was at a town meeting for prominent American Arabs and Jews. Lobby in Congress and in the Middle East to make this agreement work, he exhorted, as if addressing worker bees in a political campaign.
Playing the pitchman is a comfortable role for this President. But mobilizing domestic support is only one of many tasks facing him. A second will clearly be raising money to underwrite the accord.
In the 1970's, the 1974 disengagement agreements and the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli accords were American-made deals that the United States underwrote. In 1969, Israel and Egypt together received 2.7 per cent of American military assistance. By 1979 the figure was 82 percent. In the same 10 years, their share of bilateral economic assistance went from 1 percent to 42 percent. Since then, foreign aid to every country except Egypt and Israel has been cut.
It was necessary back then. In 1993, however, the United States does not have the money to pay for a comprehensive Middle East peace by itself. On the other hand, it will not have to -- at least not right away. A World Bank report estimates that the Israeli-occupied territories will need $3 billion over the next eight years to meet basic needs like improving water and health care. The European Community has pledged $1 billion over five years, the United States just $25 million in the coming year. "This is not like what we are trying to do in Russia," said Mr. Clinton.
In a third role, the United States sees itself as conciliator. Mr. Clinton intends to press Islamic and moderate Arab countries to accept Israel politically and economically. During the coming United Nations General Assembly, Mr. Christopher will work to break the 42-year Arab economic boycott of Israel. And the United States will try to further isolate states and groups intent on undermining the accord.
Among some Arab states, another kind of fence-mending is needed. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, for example, has assured Mr. Clinton that the Saudis will help pay for Palestinian self-rule. But the dominant image of Mr. Arafat in the kingdom remains him kissing Saddam Hussein in Baghdad during the gulf war.
For the moment, at least, the United States will not be directly involved in implementing the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, because the two sides seem to want to arrange for that themselves. Rather, the Americans are better able to play a fourth role, that of a confidence-builder.
Compared to the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, Camp David, hard as it was, seems easy, the textbook peace process. It involved two strong leaders, one relatively unimportant piece of territory -- the Sinai -- and American money to make the Israeli and Egyptian Governments feel secure.
This time, peace is messy. It involves deeply divided political communities, territories of historical and religious importance, a concept of peace that means different things to different people, the prospect that Syria could sabotage it, and an inherent tension between the logic of what the two sides have put on paper and aspirations they have set aside to discuss later.
The United States finds itself in the peculiar position of not knowing exactly where it fits as this process unfolds. Mr. Christopher said in an interview Saturday: "They have broken through the psychological barrier. That has been breached. Compared to that obstacle, the rest should be more achievable." The United States, he said, "stands ready to help manage the relationship to help the parties if they get off track."
The most crucial -- and difficult -- role for the United States will be to serve as a catalyst for securing the Israeli-Palestinian accord by pressing for a comprehensive peace. That means dancing a tense diplomatic tango with Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad.
Mr. Arafat made his peace with Israel separately, without telling the Syrian leader. Last week, Mr. Assad had to watch from the sidelines while Mr. Arafat was center stage.
 
His Friend Assad
 Mr. Clinton is embracing Mr. Assad as a serious partner to keep him both supportive of the Israeli-Palestinian deal and interested in making a separate peace. The President's speech on Monday included a not-so-subtle message of friendship. "A peace of the brave is within our reach," Mr. Clinton said, echoing words Mr. Assad has uttered himself. Yet Mr. Clinton is also keeping Mr. Assad at arm's length, both to satisfy Israel's desire to move slowly on that front and to register displeasure over Syria's support of radical Palestinians intent on scuttling the accord.
Mr. Clinton is willing to help broker a deal between Jerusalem and Damascus, but there is an ambivalence about the extent of American involvement. Mr. Christopher says he is convinced that the Palestinian-Israeli peace will hold only if there is a comprehensive settlement in the region, but he does not see himself aggressively pressing unwilling partners together the way his predecessor Henry A. Kissinger did in the days of shuttle diplomacy. "We will be available for the parties to facilitate, to intermediate -- when they are ready," he said. "That will be a major task if and when they are ready. We can't impose ourselves on the parties."
But if Mr. Clinton wants to be the President who brings peace to the Middle East, he and his Secretary of State will have to be diplomatic arm-twisters as well.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Revisiting Immigration and the Open-Door Policy

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
WITH the immigrant influx at its highest level since the early years of this century and the economy stumbling, American ambivalence about immigration is again painfully obvious. The masses of tired and poor, whether Mexican, Chinese or Haitian, find themselves less and less welcome in this nation of immigrants, as the chorus of voices calling for further restrictions grows larger and louder.
"We can no longer allow compassion to overrule reason" was the way Gov. Pete Wilson of California, which absorbed nearly half of the influx of the 1980's, phrased the issue in an open letter to President Clinton last month. But the debate over the impact of the estimated 1.25 million immigrants who enter the country legally and illegally each year is anything but reasonable. 
 Once again, as in earlier periods of economic or political insecurity, questions are being raised as to whether immigrants are a source of strength and vitality or a debilitating force that drives down wages. Once again, immigration's critics are saying that the newcomers are a burden, not a boon, overusing public services for which they do not pay taxes.
 
A Net Plus
 But the evidence put forth to support these assertions is questionable at best. Unlike the first decades of the 1900's, when the nation went through a similar influx and debate about immigration, there is now a significant body of research tracking immigrants from the moment they arrive. Most academic and government studies conclude that the presence of immigrants has some overall benefit; few say they harm the economy.
Yet perceptions die hard. Black leaders and labor unions argue that the job market is swamped with cheaply paid workers. Spokesmen of the nativist right see the newcomers swelling the welfare rolls. Disputing them, Jeffrey S. Passel, head of the immigrant research project at the Urban Institute, a research group in Washington, said "places that got immigrants during the 1980's generally did better in terms of wage growth than places that didn't." Immigrants, said Gregory De Freitas, an economist and immigration expert at Hofstra University in New York, "help expand the demand for labor and increase the number of jobs, which tends to outweigh any negative effects they may have."
During the 1980's, average wages for native-born workers hit a plateau, and those of recently arrived immigrants declined slightly. When David Card, an economist at Princeton University, examined the impact of the arrival of 125,000 Cubans in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, which increased Miami's labor force by 7 percent in an overnight expansion rarely seen in recent American history, he found that "the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers," whether white or black.
One recent study by the Urban Institute concluded that immigrants actually help create more jobs in urban areas than does the native population, especially in the non-manufacturing sector. Some other studies show that immigrants are more likely than the rest of the population to be self-employed and start their own businesses.
 
'A Multiplier Effect'
 "The question always seems to be phrased in terms of immigrants taking jobs from Americans, when lots of Americans have jobs because of the impact of immigrants on the economy," said Mr. De Freitas, who wrote "Inequality at Work: Hispanics in the U.S. Labor Force." "Immigrant restaurants and businesses pay taxes, and their workers buy clothes and food and homes in neighborhoods that were formerly dead. There's a multiplier effect, but that doesn't always get captured."
In fact, a 1991 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that the male immigrant "faces on average significantly higher rates of average taxation than do natives." Julian Simon, author of "The Economic Consequences of Immigration" calculates that during their first three decades in the country, immigrant families typically pay more taxes than their native counterparts and on average contribute about $2,500 a year more in taxes than they obtain in public services.
But the Federation for American Immigration Reform, citing other scholars, says that such conclusions are based on outdated assumptions. George J. Borjas, author of "Friends or Strangers: The Impact of Immigrants on the U.S Economy" and an economics professor at the University of California at San Diego, argues that the new wave of immigrants is not as skilled as its predecessors. As a result, he concludes, the newcomers are more likely to become a burden on the state than those who came before.
Yet data from the 1990 census indicate that while the education gap between native-born workers and immigrants may have widened, newly arrived immigrants are on the average more educated today than at any time in the past.
"There is absolutely no evidence that the quality of immigrants, which is really just a measure of education, has declined," said Marta Tienda, a sociologist and demographer at the University of Chicago. Mr. Borjas responded, "A rise in absolute levels of schooling is meaningless unless you compare it to something, and my base of comparison is with natives, who are clearly more skilled than immigrants."
Nor does it appear that immigrants make use of services like welfare or unemployment benefits with significantly greater frequency than natives. "The reason is that these people for the most part are migrating for labor, and when the jobs are not forthcoming, there is a strong tendency for return migration," said Douglas Massey, a University of Chicago sociologist who studies immigration from Mexico, the country that supplies the largest number of new arrivals. Most of those who are here illegally are afraid of any entanglement with government, researchers say. Legal immigrants waiting for their green cards know that use of such programs can lead to deportation or jeopardize their chances of sponsoring relatives for immigration.
 
Allocating Funds
 Nevertheless, to Governor Wilson and his allies, the foreigners who come here are "drawn by the giant magnet of Federal incentives" that reward immigrants "by requiring the states to provide and pay for the exploding costs of their health care, education and other benefits." Those arguments echo the findings of a study published late in 1992 by Los Angeles County, which concluded that immigrants had in the previous year incurred costs of $947 million for social services ranging from health care to public housing, while contributing revenues to the county only $139 million.
Immigration advocacy groups and scholars have been critical of the study and its methodology, however. For instance, the study defined immigrants as the 2.3 million people who had arrived, legally or illegally, since 1980, and lumped earlier arrivals with the rest of the population. Research has shown, however, that "the longer immigrants are in the country, the more they contribute to the economy," and the more prosperous they become, Mr. De Freitas said.
Still, even under the narrow definition used by the Los Angeles authorities, a closer look at the study finds inconsistencies, including data showing the county's immigrants gave more than they took. The county study concluded that immigrants paid $4.3 billion in taxes in 1991, but used only $2.5 billion in public services -- a net contribution of $1.8 billion to government.
The real problem, it would appear, is that most of the taxes immigrants pay end up in the hands of the Federal government, with little of that bonanza actually returning to the areas where immigrants live. "The solution to that is to change the distribution policy, not blame the immigrants," Mr. Simon, a professor of business at the University of Maryland, said. "Get the people in low-immigrant areas to cough up their unwarranted gains."
That imbalance illustrates a point about immigration often forgotten: while the debate is national, the flow is concentrated in a few places. There are scattered pockets of new arrivals -- Colombians in Central Falls, R.I., for example -- but more than three quarters of all legal immigrants live in six states: California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas. Add illegal immigration, and the proportion in those states rises to perhaps 90 percent, demographers say.
Yet until Governor Wilson spoke out, the members of Congress leading the charge for restrictions on immigration came from places like Wyoming and Kentucky, which have little direct experience with immigrants. All of which suggests that the immigration policy the nation ultimately chooses is likely to be dictated more by emotion and politics than logic or hard numbers. As Robert Reich, now Mr. Clinton's Secretary of Labor, wrote in 1990, when it comes to immigration, "economics is no help at all in telling us what we should do, or why."

HEADLINE: IDEAS & TRENDS;
Shantytowns, Bulldozers, And Patience: A Dilemma

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

 BODY:
IN the Depression's early days, residents of Fifth Avenue were not happy about the tarpaper shacks topped with smoke-spewing stovepipes that went up in clusters around Central Park. But few complained. Sympathy ran high in the first cold winter of the Hoovervilles.
"Effort is made in virtually all the villages to preserve the decencies of life, to maintain the spirit of self-respect that surrounds a home or the lowly semblance of one," this newspaper wrote in March 1933. "Hooligans are few. The life of an honest squatter is too austere for their kind." 
 Today, homelessness is more complex. Though times are tough, there is no one villain like the Depression. A decade of proposed solutions has yielded little but pessimism. And sympathy for the dispossessed has flagged. In the past few years, the authorities have torn down nearly every large encampment -- ones in or near Columbus Circle, the United Nations and, most recently, "the Hill," an idiosyncratic grouping of a teepee and 15 or so sturdy shacks by the Manhattan Bridge.
What survive are smaller, often temporary batches of shanties dispersed around the city. And what has happened in New York is being repeated around the country: Even as the authorities try to eliminate them,more encampments are popping up than at any time since the Depression, notably in Los Angeles, Dallas, Santa Monica, Calif., and Aurora, Ill.
In at least three cities -- Miami, Dallas and Orlando -- "safe zones" have been proposed, where the homeless would live in designated areas or in a city-sponsored pavilion without police interference.
It is not clear why subway grates, park benches and refrigerator boxes are giving way to shacks, tents and other hardier places to sleep.
"What the building and structure suggests to me is the passage of time without an adequate response," said Maria Foscarinis, director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty in Washington. "It's a response by homeless people themselves."
To be sure, there have been shantytowns on the fringes of large cities for centuries. In developing nations, they are a way of life; Rio de Janeiro has 628,000 people living, largely in squalor, on the city's outskirts, said Ganti L. Rao, director of the North American Office of the United Nations Center for Human Settlement. There are others outside Lima, Peru; Caracas, Venezuela; Calcutta and Bombay, India; Nairobi, Kenya, and Johannesburg. Most of their inhabitants are rural people seeking work in the city, Mr. Rao said, and tolerated because of the deep poverty and stark lack of housing.
By comparison, American shantytowns are tiny. During the Depression, scores of Hoovervilles rose; the largest in New York was beside the East River at Ninth Street and in 1933 housed some 450 men. In 1991, an encampment in Tompkins Square Park was home to about 200 people until it was bulldozed.
 
Follow the Money
 Patterns of settlement have also differed. Third world shantytowns are usually on public land at a city's edge, often at the end of a long commute for its workers. But the American homeless congregate in very central locations -- in Manhattan, for example, near the Port Authority bus terminal, Columbus Circle and public parks -- because services and money are there.
"In the business districts, there are a lot of opportunities for panhandling, for food, for churches," said Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and planning at New York University. "Once a group gets started, it encourages others to join in."
Though the United States has its own troubles building enough affordable housing, shantytowns are barely tolerated here because they are homes not to a city's laborers and domestics, but often to its alcoholics, drug abusers and mentally ill.
The authorities are rarely willing to let them remain -- because of fire safety and public health, but also because of political pressure. The administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins has consistently torn down shantytowns in Manhattan, though officials say there is no set policy on when or why to act.
"There isn't any one deciding factor," said Sam Szurek, a spokesman for the Department of Homeless Services. "Sometimes it can be a fire hazard. Sometimes it can be a security problem, like at the United Nations. Sometimes it can be a transportation hazard. The policy is that we are constantly reaching out and we don't encourage people to live in the streets."
At Tompkins Square, for example, the encampment was in the center of a three-block-long park that was virtually the only patch of green for much of the Lower East Side. The neighbors had complained for years about the tents, homeless men in the playgrounds, campfires and music. The police called it a major drug center.
"The Hill" was bulldozed after it had several fires, one of which killed a resident. Drugs and local complaints were also an issue.
But advocates say that the homeless are being deliberately forced to the city's fringes to be forgotten. Many oppose the "safe-zone" concept for that reason. The paradox, said Richard C. Wade, a professor of urban history at the City University of New York, is that tearing down either slums or temporary shanties actually makes the problem more visible.
"In the old days," he said, "we had more people living in substandard housing, but you didn't see them. Now they are sleeping on Fifth Avenue. That's what drives people crazy."

HEADLINE: SIDE AGREEMENTS TO TRADE ACCORD VARY IN AMBITION

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 18

 BODY:
The environmental side agreement that President Clinton negotiated to the North American Free Trade Agreement is much broader and ambitious than the companion labor agreement, one reason why many environmentalists now support free trade with Mexico and Canada while labor leaders are united against it.
Final legal texts released this week by the White House have made labor unions even more unhappy. They show that while the environmental pact will create a powerful three-nation bureaucracy to pursue a wide array of environmental problems, the labor pact will create a much smaller and tamer apparatus limited in its enforcement powers to a narrow range of specific issues. 
 The free trade agreement is intended to create a common market in North America by gradually lowering trade barriers between the three countries. The side agreements on labor and environmental issues are intended to prevent each country from gaining a competitive advantage in trade by failing to enforce labor and environmental laws. The pacts were negotiated primarily because of concerns about Mexico's enforcement measures, but apply to the United States and Canada as well, a prospect that alarms some American businesses and Republicans.
 
Reasons for Broader Pact
 Just one of the reasons the environmental agreement is the broader pact is that Mexico and Canada staunchly resisted any loss of control over their labor markets. In addition, environmentalists were more willing than labor unions to support free trade in exchange for specific provisions in the side agreements.
The Clinton Administration also had to walk a political tightrope during the negotiations. Congressional Republicans, most of whom have long supported free trade, say that they warned the White House this summer that they would not vote for the free trade agreement if the side agreements created extensive new international bureaucracies that would infringe on American sovereignty or burden American companies.
Each agreement creates a commission, composed of the labor or environmental ministers of all three countries, and a secretariat whose staff will be protected from pressure by national governments through rules that will make it hard to dismiss them. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, will represent the United States.
But the North American Labor Commission will be limited at first to a staff of 15 people, while there are no limits on the size of the North American Environmental Commission. And the labor commission can research cases of lax Government enforcement only after receiving permission from two of the three countries' labor ministers. The environmental panel, by contrast, can investigate any case of lax enforcement unless explicitly banned from doing so by two of the three countries' environmental ministers.
 
Penalties Are Limited
 All types of environmental problems are subject to fines and trade sanctions. But in labor cases, such penalties are limited to those involving worker safety, child labor and minimum wages. On other labor issues, like Mexico's many restrictions on labor unions, the ministers of the three countries can only discuss the problems without taking action.
Administration officials explained the fine print to A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials on Friday, and the union officials were appalled. "We certainly believe that the rights of workers were shortchanged in this agreement, and it is clear that even the imperfect environmental accord is stronger," said Mark A. Anderson, the director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Task Force on Trade.
"It is difficult for me to believe that 15 people, however qualified or energetic they may be, can examine problems across the continent," he said. "This sounds like it isn't going to be much more than an office with a fax machine and some telephones."
The labor pact allows each country to set up a separate office in its capital to investigate labor abuses in all three countries. The size of these offices has not been determined, although Administration officials say that they will give the United States office adequate resources.
Lawrence Katz, the Labor Department's chief economist, said that the labor side agreement might look weak on paper because the size and political independence of the national administrative offices have not been defined. "What's in the text is not the full story on the labor side," he said.
 
Unions Not Impressed
 But American unions have been unimpressed.
"It's clear that the environmental agreement is tighter and stronger, and I think that's largely a function that large environmental groups played a large and effective role in shaping that agreement," said Robert A. Pastor, the director of the Latin American and Caribbean program at the Carter Center in Atlanta.
Mr. Pastor contended that the weaker labor agreement partly reflected the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s reluctance to offer support for the North American Free Trade Agreement unless the side pact addressed two dozen union concerns, among them higher wages in Mexico. But the Mexican Government resisted concessions on labor issues, people who were involved in the negotiations said.
Mexico has much stronger labor laws on its books than the United States, but many are not enforced. Mexican officials were reluctant to be required, in effect, to raise their country's labor standards abruptly, in some cases above American standards. Enforcing all of these laws could have jolted the Mexican economy.
Administration officials said last spring that the United States wanted the three-nation labor and environmental commissions to be nearly identical. But an Administration trade official said that American negotiators were unable to persuade Mexico and Canada.
"We were able to get more of a consensus with respect to environmental issues than with respect to labor issues, which in many respects are regarded as more political and more within the control of each nation," said the official, who insisted on anonymity. Canada and Mexico "weren't really willing at the outset to contemplate tri-national or supranational arrangements, but as things moved on, it became clear that people were more willing to try things out in the environmental area."
Mr. Katz of the Labor Department said that veterans of international labor issues were more skeptical of international institutions than environmentalists and more willing to put their faith in national institutions.
Another difference between the two side agreements that has upset labor involves the data used in investigations. The labor agreement restricts the international secretariat to using publicly available information from each country's government. By contrast, the environmental agreement allows the use of information gathered by the staff, nonprofit organizations, public conferences and even outside specialists hired by the secretariat for specific investigations.
Mr. Anderson said that he would not trust official labor information from the Mexican Government. "These are the folks who claim they have 2 percent unemployment," he said.
But, the national offices in each capital, which would be separate from the secretariat, would also be allowed to use information from staff, unions and outside specialists.
In contrast with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., national environmental groups that agreed to support the Administration have been rewarded with a variety of special deals. The National Audubon Society, for example, was one of six large environmental groups that endorsed the North American Free Trade Agreement this week based on the side agreements. Peter A. A. Berle, the president of the society, said in an interview on Thursday that the group's support was partly based on an assurance from the Administration that an agreement on migratory birds in the Western Hemisphere would be added to a list of environmental pacts protected from legal challenges by the the free-trade agreement.
Ms. Browner of the E.P.A. told reporters on Friday that the Administration was in the process of adding the migratory birds deal to the list.
 
Local Opposition
 Many state and local environmental groups oppose the side agreement, saying it does not go nearly far enough to protect the environment. Those groups were not involved in the hundreds of meetings between Administration officials and executives of large environmental groups. The Sierra Club and about 300 of the smaller groups condemned the side agreement on Monday. In an odd twist, nearly a dozen local chapters of the National Audubon Society were among these 300 groups.
The ability of the Administration to pursue ambitious side deals was constrained by complaints from Republican members of Congress concerned about the possible effects on American sovereignty and companies. Representative Bill Archer, Republican of Texas, who is the ranking minority member of the Ways and Means Committee, had warned the Administration against one broad legal provision that did not appear in the final texts.
"Clearly they could have stepped a step farther and lost me," Mr. Archer said.

HEADLINE: A Faith Reviving: Jews in Russia/A special report.;
In a Less Arid Russia, Jewish Life Flowers Again

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Sept. 18

 BODY:
Ilya Drutz, an agile, round-cheeked boy of 12, was calmly describing his decision to become circumcised. Last summer, he attended Moscow's first Jewish camp.
"Before I went to the camp I knew nothing about my religion, and I felt very uncomfortable," he said. "My father is a writer and my mother a librarian, and religion wasn't talked about at home." 
 When a mohel, who does circumcisions, came to the camp, Ilya said, "I started to think of who and what I am, and finally I decided that if I'm a Jew, I should follow the customs of my people."
"When the mohel left, I felt sorry," he said, "and I decided that if he came again I'd be circumcised. When he came I was the first in line."
Around him, nine young men, all wearing yarmulkes, listened with varying degrees of respect or discomfort. They had taken a break from a class at a private Jewish school that had just moved into a Moscow city building 10 days before. It had long outgrown its premises in the central Moscow Choral Synagogue.
It was the first time the city had given over a school to a Jewish group, in this case the Orthodox Chabad Lubavitch Jews. About 200 boys and girls, ages 6 to 16, are attending classes as workmen hammer and saw around them. Some 100 others want to join, said the headmaster, Zev Kuravsky, a 45-year-old physicist who taught his two sons at home when they were abused at school for being Jewish.
As the number of Jews emigrating from the former Soviet Union continues to drop, this school is another indication of the blossoming and institutionalization of Jewish life in a more democratic Russia, where religion of all kinds -- and especially Russian Orthodoxy -- can be openly embraced. The Soviet state ideology of atheism and organized anti-Semitism has all but disappeared.
The Jewish question has long been a barometer of life in Russia, going back to the pogroms under the czars. In the Soviet period, the status of Jews became a major cold war and human rights issue, with American trade restrictions imposed by Congress tied to the level of Jewish emigration.
Anti-Semitism remains and is manipulated by ultranationalist politicians on the fringes, and it is more open now in its expression than it was in the Soviet Union, with placards on walls, petty vandalism and some anti-Jewish articles in a freer press.
But anti-Semitic acts are few, and many Russian Jews feel that the dangers can be exaggerated in the West. Some young Jews like Ilya Drutz and his classmates say that their open profession of belief has even earned them some respect among their non-Jewish friends, sometimes among the same boys who persecuted them earlier.
 
Emigration
Jews Find a Niche And Exodus Slows

Through July, said Alexander Libin of the Israeli Embassy's Migration Department, about 38,000 Jews had left the former Soviet Union for Israel this year, and emigration continues at about 5,000 a month. But these Jews are mostly from Central Asia or the war-ravaged hot spots like Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Georgia.
Those numbers are down considerably from earlier years when the Soviet Union finally opened the gates. In 1989, some 13,000 Soviet Jews emigrated to Israel; in 1990, 185,000 went and the following year 170,000.
But by 1992, the figure was back down to only 64,500, in large part because of stories of crowded housing and unemployment in Israel. Some Russian Jews have even returned, finding Israel too difficult.
In the former Soviet Union, there are now 2 million to 2.5 million Jews, said Tankred G. Golanpolsky, editor and publisher of The Jewish Gazette, a Russian-language semimonthly with 42,000 circulation. By official statistics in 1985, there were 1.8 million Soviet citizens with their nationality listed as "Jewish" in their passports, but many found it advisable to try to assimilate. Perhaps 600,000 Jews have left the former Soviet Union since the late 1980's, Mr. Golanpolsky said.
In Russia now, he estimates, there are some 1.7 million Jews; 180,000 live in Moscow, the second-largest minority after Ukrainians.
 
Jews Acknowledged Openly
 "The diaspora in Russia will remain for a very long time," Mr. Golanpolsky said. "Jews here have found themselves a niche. They wanted to be acknowledged openly and they are; they are not hindered in their jobs. They wanted to be able to make money and not be accused of stealing, and now they can.
"They wanted to travel, and now they can. We may have a lousy apartment, but it's better than the one offered in Israel. We may have a lousy car, but it's ours, and we know our way about."
But there is less willingness among Jews to be Jewish in the traditional sense, he said. Moscow's three synagogues, all Orthodox, were full on Wednesday evening, the beginning of the Jewish New Year. But on a normal Friday at the central synagogue, he said, "you'll see fewer than 20 Jews, many of them from the Caucasus."
There are also various groups who gather in private homes to pray. But the vast majority of Russian Jews, he said, are not religious. "It's very hard to overcome 70 years of socialism in three years," he said.
On Wednesday evening, at the Moscow Choral Synagogue, Vadim, a 25-year-old banker, said he thought too many Jews had left. "There are some Jewish centers forming now," he said, "but how long they last depends on how many Jews leave." Life was better in Russia now, he said. "Now you can earn money in Russia, not in Israel."
The real question today, Mr. Golanpolsky said, is "how to bring about a Jewish revival in Russia, especially among the youth."
 
'Real Community' Needed
 Many Jews will stay in Russia, he and others said, and needed a real community. Even if all Russian Jews left in the next 10 or 15 years, Mr. Golanpolsky said, "in order to come to Israel and feel at home, a Jew must understand what it is to be Jewish, and that must be taught here."
The same arguments come separately from Rabbi Berel Lazar, a 29-year-old Lubavitcher, born in Italy, who has been instrumental in finding new quarters for this Jewish school.
"More and more Jews in Russia are not planning to leave," Rabbi Lazar said. "They have lives and businesses here, and even if they feel it may be dangerous, there's nothing for them in Israel. More and more people are getting used to the idea they can have a religious life in Russia."
 
Jewish Life
Network Is Forming As More Seek Roots
 The name of this school is Achei Tmimim, or Fully Brothers, and in addition to the regular curriculum, students are given daily 40-minute classes in both Hebrew and Judaism. They pay a token tuition of about $3 a month; most of the teachers take minimal salaries.
Rabbi Lazar has raised about $50,000 here and in the United States to support the school, though he is not sure how they will pay to fix the leaky roof. "Even when Jews make money here," he said, "they don't know what it is yet to give money."
Some Jews suggest privately that the Lubavitchers, a proselytizing sect, are "buying souls," but Rabbi Lazar said the school was Lubavitch "only in the sense that it is run by people close to Lubavitch." Many Russian Jews who knew enough to teach have already left for Israel, "and many who stay are close to us."
Like almost all rabbis here, Rabbi Lazar is foreign trained, here on contract. Even the Chief Rabbi, Adolf S. Shayevich, was trained abroad, in Hungary.
 
Unversed in Judaism
 Russian Jews know little about Judaism, Rabbi Lazar said. "So many kids know absolutely zero," he said. "Many have never met another Jew. I'd say many non-Jews in America know more about Judaism than many Jews here."
Though only beginning, a network of Jewish schools, organizations and even restaurants is developing, often with Western help. There are many non-Lubavitcher schools in Moscow, including a few secondary schools, and Sunday schools. But the number of students remains small, probably fewer than 1,000.
In addition to The Jewish Gazette, there are two monthlies: Moscow Jerusalem, a Zionist paper that reprints Russian-language Israeli articles and has about 10,000 readers; and Jewish News, published by the Central Synagogue for about 2,000 members. The Reform movement sends in a paper, Rivulet or Source, with about 8,000 readers, for special holidays. The Lubavitchers have their own publication, L'Chaim.
There is also the Lubavitcher summer camp, which last summer took 600 children; seminars for adults; women's groups; lectures, and circumcision ceremonies. Sometimes, fathers and sons take part on the same day.
Much is going on outside Moscow. Svetlana A. Yakimenko, a teacher, runs the local office of Project Kesher, Connections in Hebrew. Working with an American from Illinois, Sallie E. Gratch, whom she met on a 1987 peace march from Odessa to Kiev, Mrs. Yakimenko helps small groups of Jews all over the Soviet Union to make contact with one another, as well as with organizations abroad. The project makes special efforts to help Jewish women.
 
A Project for Small Towns
 Deliberately staying away from major capitals like Moscow and Kiev, Project Kesher has made connections in Belarus, Ukraine and even Yakutia, in Siberia, and Magadan, the center of the Far Eastern gulag, including towns with fewer than 200 Jews. It has organized a Jewish Association of Small Towns in Ukraine.
"Jews are now a respectable part of society," Mrs. Yakimenko said. "We don't touch the issue of emigrating; that's for people to decide. But they live here now and want to learn their history, culture and traditions, which were denied to them, even if they are not religious."
"Many people still plan to emigrate," she said. "But a lot stay, and they want to have their lives here and restore their Jewish roots. That's how we help."
Mrs. Yakimenko, who married a non-Jewish Ukrainian, is not a practicing Jew. Where she lives, 40 miles outside Moscow, there are only three Jewish families, and no synagogue. Her two daughters, 15 and 10, consider themselves Jewish, she said.
She paused. Her sister has gone to Israel, she said. "Maybe we'll leave," she said. "But life is now more open, and for now we want to be part of it."
Vera A. Dreznina, a 69-year-old painter wrapped in a long purple scarf, is more typical of her class and generation. "We think about leaving" after a life of persecution both petty and vicious, she said, "but generally those of my class and circle have stayed."
 
'Being Jewish Was a Fact'
 She is of a central Moscow family, Jewish but assimilated, with a long history of education and artistic achievement. "Deep in my soul I have the feeling I am not a Russian, though we grew up on Russian culture," she said. "Being Jewish was a fact, but not much discussed." Her husband, now dead, served in the military but was forced to leave after World War II in a bizarre case that stemmed from his Jewishness, she says.
Still, she has stayed, and she admits that snobbishness is the main reason. "Some say there are too many Jews in Israel," she said, laughing. "For me, Moscow is the capital, the center, and it's important to me that I live here. If I emigrate, I couldn't live in a second-rate city in one-story America or in some grassy English province. Here I feel I'm someone; there, I'm nobody."
Even so, she said, Russian Jews are divided into those who have decided to leave and those who haven't yet decided, and the two can barely talk to one another. There is a third group, she said, which has decided "for sure" not to go, but she imagines it to be small. "More are like me," she said. "I wouldn't say I'll never decide to leave, but we try to find arguments for staying."
 
The Choice
Young Are Building Lives in Russia
 Igor Bukharov, 33, has found his reason. He has opened Moscow's first kosher fast-food restaurant, Gamburger. His father was a Soviet Army officer "who always avoided the topic of religion," but for some reason, at 15, Mr. Bukharov had the idea of opening a Jewish restaurant in Moscow.
"I even became a little Zionist," he said. During the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, he said, "I made paper planes with the Star of David on them and threw them in class."
He became a chef, and convinced his workers' collective, none of them Jewish, to turn their newly privatized restaurant, near the Kazan railway station, into a kosher one, serving salads, vegetable burgers and a decent, if slightly greasy, falafel in pita bread.
But Mr. Bukharov, too, is not especially religious, and he has not had his his 8-month-old son circumcised.
"There's a strong residue of the past," he says. "But I'm not like my father, who is a thoroughbred Soviet Jew." Meaning? "A Jew persecuted all his life, aggravated by all the complexes of a Soviet citizen, with a willingness to refuse his true self."
'Enough Will Stay'
As for emigration, Mr. Bukharov said, young people are making their lives and livings here. "Enough will stay, I'm sure, to build a community."
Mr. Bukharov, like a number of Russian Jews interviewed, is wary about Israel's recognition of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the foundations of a Palestinian state. "I don't think it will lead to peace," he said. "Look at Lebanon, where the Muslims can't even get along. But time will show us." Many new Russian emigres to Israel are living in the occupied territories, and the agreement may thus make Israel less attractive to Russians worried about housing.
But Russians brought up on propaganda about Zionism and racism will also have less reason to criticize Israel or feed anti-Semitism. For Mr. Golanpolsky of the Jewish Gazette, who is being sued for libel by the far-right organization Pamyat for calling it anti-Semitic, Russian Jews still have a reasonable fear of Slavic xenophobia and persecution.
"Fear is in the genes," he said, adding tht anti-Semitism in Russia today is abstract. "It's a certain metaphysical concept floating over Russia, but not landing, thank God. For the masses, Jews today are not the face of the enemy. The enemy is in the market, where Chechens and Azeris are selling tomatoes for high prices, or sitting in the kiosks and selling Snickers for 400 rubles, which they can't afford. And if the pot overboils, they will break down the kiosks and beat those faces."
 
Fewer Than 200 Refuseniks
 Even the long, tortured problem of the "refuseniks," Jews whose applications for emigration were denied on the basis that they knew state secrets, has improved considerably, though it has not disappeared.
Boris L. Altschuler of Movement Without Frontiers, part of the Moscow Research Center for Human Rights, said the number of refuseniks was now fewer than 200, though resolved cases are often replaced with new ones. A Government commission to investigate each case is making progress, Mr. Altschuler said.
"The reality is that many people are applying to leave who earlier never thought of it because they were working in secret institutions," he said.
Today the only legal restriction on free emigration is knowledge of official or scientific "secrets." The biggest difficulty for ordinary Russians who are not Jews or Germans, with a special right of return, is getting another country to take them.
As for young Ilya Drutz and his friends in school, they are confused about whether to stay or go. Leonid Perlov and Aleksandr Usorok are arguing about it.
"I decided not to tell everyone I'm Jewish, because Russians don't like Jews, and I probably won't live here," Leonid said.
 
'Lucky in Your Friends'
 "Not all Russians," Aleksandr said. "And we know life in Israel is very hard."
"All my friends know I'm religious and a Jew," Ilya said. "I wouldn't say they care or laugh at me."
"You're lucky in your friends," Leonid said.
And what do Ilya's parents think? Do they think he has chosen a difficult path for himself? The boy rubbed his ear. "My father thinks I probably won't be able to handle it," he said quietly. "Though he wasn't actually against it. My mother thinks it'll be O.K."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
The Gorilla in the Living Room: New Jersey's Annual Budget Gap

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWARK, Sept. 17

 BODY:
With Election Day six weeks away, Gov. Jim Florio and his rival, Christine Todd Whitman, are fully engaged in baiting and bickering over one thing or another. But they have yet to grapple publicly with the phantom that will haunt the next administration, no matter who runs it: New Jersey's annual dance of the budget deficit.
Mr. Florio, a Democrat, has talked about jobs: how he has created them or helped attract them. Mrs. Whitman, a Republican, intends to talk about jobs, when she puts forth her own economic-stimulus program next Tuesday. Legislative leaders on both sides of the aisle are eager to talk about jobs too. Jobs bring revenue, they say, and revenue will enable the Governor and the Legislature to avoid quick fixes or gimmicks to close gaps in an annual budget that has grown beyond $15 billion. 
 Talking about job growth is easier and more optimistic than talking about debt, especially in a year in which all 120 legislators face the voters. Talking about neither is even better, especially when any serious discussion of taxes and spending runs into the reality of four years of recession that cost New Jersey one job in 12.
Next year's budget is already $1.5 billion out of balance, according to most estimates, in large part because previous budgets have been balanced by pulling one-time-only rabbits out of the hat. Even if officials are successful in working other temporary budget magic, some additional big bills may come due over the next four years:
*A recent court decision said the state must come up with $450 million more for school aid in poor districts. The State Supreme Court will rule on this soon. It could tell the state how to solve the problem or it could just order it to do so. Waiting for the court gives the candidates a good excuse not to talk about school aid. That topic, and any discussion of how the state allows schools to be run, could run afoul of the state's most powerful lobby, the New Jersey Education Association.
*Medicaid, a $2 billion item in the current budget, tends to increase between $200 milion and $250 million a year. Luckily for the candidates, waiting to hear how much the Clinton health plan will cost automatically propels health care issues onto the shelf for now.
*Corrections and law enforcement, one of the fastest-growing segments of the budget, is $635 million now and likely to grow under New Jersey's mandatory sentencing laws. With both candidates wanting to appear tough on crime, this is a tough line item to reduce.
*Public employee benefits, already $1.2 billion and scheduled to rise by $150 million in the next budget, might be a popular topic for the Republicans, who have complained about big government getting bigger. But taking away jobs or cutting salaries and benefits is not useful before Election Day.
In fact, it could be politically suicidal for the candidates to put forward a budgetary repair scheme, general or specific. Nobody would want to suggest tax increases. Nobody would want to put forward a plan that relies on an unpredictable economy. Nobody would want to face six weeks explaining a program too vague to be defended or too complicated for voters to understand.
Mr. Florio, in particular, would like to make voters forget that, despite the nearly $3 billion in new taxes he rammed through the Legislature in 1990, in part to help close a deficit left by his Republican predecessor, the state still has to scrounge for income.
"I'd ask the candidates what they would cut," said David Kehler, director of the Public Affairs Research Institute, a nonpartisan policy analysis group in Princeton.
 
No Takers
 In an election year that's a question no one really wants to answer. So the Governor, a Democrat, and the Legislature, which has veto-proof Republican majorities in both houses, have all but decided to ignore the matter.
"It was such when the Republican-controlled Legislature agreed with the Democratic Governor to take these issues off the table," said Clifford Zukin, a professor at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers. "In a sense, the Governor has shared power with the Legislature in the last two years," he said.
A good thing, too, said the Assembly Speaker, Garabed "Chuck" Haytaian: "It's better for him since he started working with us over the past year. He came to the realization that we had the ability to govern if he didn't want to."
Because the budget is everybody's problem, it has become nobody's problem. It could stay that way if the Florio camp continues to succeed in controlling the campaign debate.
"It is a function of how to run the campaign," said Neil Upmeyer, president of the Center for Analysis of Public Issues in Princeton. "It is an indication of success on Florio's part and a failure on her part that it is unfolding the way it is."
In the last few weeks, the Florio campaign has hammered away at the Governor's success in banning assault weapons, after overcoming a threatened veto by the Legislature. In television ads and in speeches, he has painted Mrs. Whitman as wishy-washy on the issue.
 
Florio's Welfare Proposal
 Earlier this month, Mr. Florio introduced proposals to tighten requirements for welfare checks, prompting an outcry from Mrs. Whitman. The Governor would require a welfare mother to provide the name of the father before she could be eligible for payments, and he would channel welfare checks to teen-age mothers through a parent or guardian.
When Mrs. Whitman protested that to do so seemed reminiscent of Nazi tactics of publicly identifying Jews during the Holocaust, the Florio campaign rallied support from Jewish leaders who called Mrs. Whitman insensitive for appearing to trivialize the Holocaust.
"The welfare story was what we were all thinking about this week," Mr. Upmeyer said. "Florio got a twofer. He not only controlled the message, but he was very fortunate in having her react, and than dragging the issue of Holocaust victims into it.
"What does that have to do with the issues?" he said. "It's a play to the emotions of a certain class of voter with a very specific interest and little to do with the direction of state government."
Mr. Upmeyer called it a stratetic decision as well. "It says, 'Vote for me.' There is little he can do to endear him to the voters of New Jersey, except to demonstrate to them that there is no clear-cut or attractive alternative to re-electing him."

HEADLINE: With Leaders Leaving Office for Jail, Kentucky Works to Refurbish Image

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FRANKFORT, Ky., Sept. 17

 BODY:
As in many states, the spoils of office -- jobs, appointments, contracts -- are an integral part of politics in Kentucky, handed out and accepted with the wink of an eye and a knowing nod.
But over the last 18 months, two Federal investigations have suggested that Kentucky's spoils system, unlike those in many other states, is characterized more by major corruption than the usual petty excess. 
 Fifteen top state legislators, lobbyists and other public figures, including the former Speaker of the Kentucky House, have been convicted or face trial on various charges of bribery, extortion, fraud and racketeering.
They were snared in an investigation into the Legislature's regulation of horse-track betting and hospitals, the most serious corruption inquiry of any state legislature in recent years.
 
Undercover Operation
 Day after day for the past year and a half, Kentuckians have been embarrassed, and transfixed, by a relentless stream of testimony about pervasive payoffs and greed. Many of the ethical lapses were captured by hidden cameras and microphones as part of a sting operation code-named Boptrot, a word play on the name of the House Business Organizations and Professions Committee, which deals with horse racing.
"Things somehow got out of hand," said the Speaker of the Kentucky House, Joe Clarke.
He is new to his job, the most powerful legislative post in the state. The previous speaker, Don Blandford, was caught on camera in the Boptrot inquiry taking a bribe from a lobbyist who wanted to kill a bill that would have limited the type of betting some tracks could offer.
"Bless your heart," he told the lobbyist as he stuffed the money into his pocket. Mr. Blandford was convicted last April on charges of extortion and racketeering and is awaiting sentencing. He is appealing the verdict.
The investigation continues, with Federal prosecutors promising more indictments.
The latest person arrested in Boptrot was George Atkins, a lobbyist who is a former State Auditor and one-time candidate for Governor. He was arraigned here in Federal District Court on Thursday.
 
$10,000 for Crucial Vote
 "Guilty," he replied when asked for his plea to charges that he had paid a state legislator $10,000 in exchange for a crucial vote on a bill to allow Humana, the national medical-care conglomerate, to expand operations at its headquarters in Louisville.
In return for his guilty plea, Mr. Atkins will receive a reduced sentence of no more than a year in prison and will cooperate with investigators.
Most of the other legislators and lobbyists charged in the investigation have also negotiated pleas and are awaiting reduced sentences and calls to testify at future trials.
Humana, which dismissed Mr. Atkins when he was arrested, has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
In the other investigation that has raised disturbing questions about public corruption in Kentucky, Dr. William Collins, a dentist who is the husband of former Gov. Martha Layne Collins, has been charged with extortion. He is accused of demanding almost $1.7 million in payments from bond underwriters who sought to win $1 billion in state financing and development contracts from 1983 to 1987, the years that his wife held office. Among the underwriters was Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., the large New York firm.
Dr. Collins, whose trial is under way here in Federal District Court, describes the money he got from the underwriters as voluntary investments in his horse-breeding enterprises. He also contends that there was nothing amiss when Lufkin & Jenrette picked up a $35,000 bill for a piano he had handcrafted for his wife in Germany.
Prosecutors see it far differently. "These people were making their investments so they could get these contracts," Assistant United States Attorney John Compton said at the opening of the trial. "These were extortion payments."
None of the bond underwriters have been accused of wrongdoing. But the investigation continues and the case is being cited as another example of the freewheeling, lightly regulated way bonds are sometimes marketed in this country.
Taken together, the two Kentucky scandals are regarded as the worst bout of public corruption in a state since Federal investigators descended on the South Carolina and Arizona capitals two years ago, arresting more than a dozen public figures in each on bribery and extortion charges.
Specialists in state government and politics say there is no real evidence that corruption in state legislatures is on the rise throughout the country.
"We don't see any national net increase," said Rich Jones, who follows such issues for the National Conference of State Legislatures. "We believe legislatures and legislators are at least as honest now as before, and probably even more so because more and more are passing ethics laws and the media is watching more closely. But now and again, people try to slip one by and investigators move in."
They moved in when they received information that Bill McBee, a former State Representative turned lobbyist, might be involved in bribery to win approval of track regulation. A secret microphone picked up the details of the scheme and Mr. McBee was arrested and pleaded guilty.
The image of lobbyists and legislators and former legislators in the dock is far from the one Kentucky has long sought to cultivate.
It is a state with a considerable history of poverty, illiteracy and clan violence, one struggling to hold onto its population and improve its economy. But it is also the state of blue grass, thoroughbreds and mellow bourbon, and it prefers to be thought of as a place of gentility, not venality.
Government witnesses have told of a cozy legislative world in Frankfort, one of the smallest capital cities in the country, in which the level of corruption slowly grew in recent years as the Legislature, which historically has not been as powerful as Kentucky's governors, determinedly became a greater force in ruling the state.
 
A Cozy Relationship
 "Lawmakers and lobbyists here just got too cozy over the years," House Speaker Clarke said.
The one good thing to come out of the scandal is that surviving lawmakers have passed a strong ethics-in-government law aimed at preventing any future malfeasance. A legislator is now forbidden to take "anything of value" from a lobbyist, excluding food and drink, and a lobbyist may buy a legislator no more than $100 worth of food and drink a year.
"It's reached the point that I don't even let a lobbyist pay for my coffee these days," Speaker Clarke said.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
Florio Forced to Retreat After a Hasty Charge

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

 BODY:
There are two fruit farmers in Burlington County, N.J., named William Haines, and because of that, the normally hard-charging campaign of Gov. Jim Florio found itself in the unfamiliar role of retreating last week.
In Atlantic City on Thursday to accept the endorsement of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O., Mr. Florio used the occasion to heave a barrage of criticisms at his Republican opponent, Christine Todd Whitman. Among them was that Mrs. Whitman's adviser on agricultural issues was facing fines over a string of violations on a farm he owns. 
 The Florio campaign machine then issued a 10-page news release that detailed the charges:
"Farms owned by State Senator William Haines Jr. -- who Whitman named July 14, 1993, as the chair of her Council for Economic Recovery's Agriculture panel -- have been cited by the Federal Government for failing to provide farmworkers with toilet or handwashing facilities and face $30,000 in state fines for improper use of dangerous pesticides."
While the State Senator in question -- a Republican from Mount Laurel who answers to C. William Haines and grows peaches -- is contesting pending fines against his farm, he is not the William S. Haines, cranberry farmer and county neighbor but not kin, who is working with the Whitman campaign.
The two farmers are frequently mistaken for each other, so much so that those who know the potential for confusion refer to them as "Cranberry Bill" and "Peaches Bill." Given the charges and that they came in the thick of a gubernatorial campaign, it bloomed into a not-so-mild embarrassment for Mr. Florio and allowed Mrs. Whitman, for one of the few times in the campaign, to chortle over a gaffe.
 
A Run-In With Miss America
 It was not the only case of mistaken identity for the Florio campaign last week.
After addressing a teamsters convention on Tuesday at the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, the Governor was leaving the meeting room with a phalanx of security guards and state police when they ran into a cluster of women blocking the hallway.
"You'll have to step aside," one member of the security party ordered politely, as others stepped forward to herd the group to a side of the corridor.
That set off a clatter of explanations that began to rise in pitch as Mr. Florio neared. A potential public-relations nightmare for the Governor was averted when a petite woman in the group was able to rivet the security detail's attention by declaring, "But I'm Miss America!"
That brought the Florio party to an abrupt stop and led to a brief conversation between the Governor and Leanza Cornett, whose reign as Miss America ended last night.
 
Reinvesting in South Africa
 New Jersey is moving toward lifting the ban it imposed eight years ago on state investments in South Africa.
Assemblyman Willie B. Brown, a Democrat from Newark, introduced legislation last Monday to repeal the state's divestiture laws and reinstate business trade with South Africa and companies doing business with it. Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, a Republican, is a prime co-sponsor of the bill.
State Senator Peter A. Inverso has said he will introduce similar legislation in the Senate.
Mr. Brown, who returned two weeks ago from a visit to South Africa, said he introduced the legislation at the urging of the African National Congress and its leader, Nelson R. Mandela.
Mr. Brown sponsored the original divestiture bill, which took effect on Aug. 27, 1985. When Gov. Thomas H. Kean signed the legislation, $2.1 billion of New Jersey's $10 billion in public employee pension funds was invested in companies doing business with South Africa. The divestiture was the largest by any state.

HEADLINE: A Retreat on Gay Soldiers

 BODY:
By the time Senator Sam Nunn and his wrecking crew got through with it, President Clinton's much-battered effort to allow homosexuals to serve openly in the military had been damaged even further. The Senate was not content to accept the weak compromise already agreed to by the Clinton Administration and Joint Chiefs. Rather, Mr. Nunn has pushed through a bill designed to make certain that homosexuals are kept out of the military -- and that any further changes in policy head toward exclusion rather than inclusion.
This benighted retreat from principle is driven by prejudice and politics. That became inescapably clear with the release of a previously suppressed study by the Rand Corporation, the Pentagon's favorite think tank. Rand's analysis concludes that homosexuals can serve openly and effectively -- provided the policy gets strong leadership from above. But leadership, alas, has been sadly missing in this whole rancorous debate. 
 President Clinton was on the right track when he pledged during the campaign to lift the ban on gay service members. But once in office, Mr. Clinton erred by not lifting it with the stroke of a pen. Instead, after months of wrangling, the Administration issued a half-hearted policy on July 19 that left the ban in place but curbed the screening and investigations designed to ferret out homosexuals.
Now the Senate is trying to dilute even this watered-down policy. The senators want to codify into law the most repressive parts while inviting an overturn of the more liberal parts. For example, the Senate tepidly endorsed Mr. Clinton's order to stop asking all recruits about homosexuality, but stressed that the Secretary of Defense could reinstate the questioning at any time. The Senate report also expressed concern that the Administration's plan to tamp down overzealous investigations might go too far; it emphasized that commanders still retain discretion to initiate investigations as they deem necessary.
The malicious unfairness of the Senate's approach was most blatant with respect to enforcing the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The Administration has told commanders to investigate sexual-conduct violations in "an even-handed manner," but the Senate made no mention of equal treatment and focused instead on homosexual conduct.
The whole purpose of the Senate bill is to exclude homosexuals because their presence would create an "unacceptable risk" to morale, discipline and unit cohesion. But it is shocking how little evidence supports that assertion. When challenged on the floor, Senator Nunn cited the predictable testimony of top generals. Their seasoned judgments deserve to be weighed -- but they may simply be reluctant to tackle a tough social issue.
The Rand report offers voluminous evidence that homosexuals and heterosexuals could indeed work together effectively. Its researchers visited foreign military establishments that welcome or tolerate homosexuals, including such capable armies as those of Israel, France and Canada; none thought their effectiveness had been reduced. The researchers visited police and fire departments where gay and heterosexual members put their lives at risk together; none reported a loss of effectiveness.
They also reviewed the military's own historical experience with racial integration, finding there was no loss of combat effectiveness. Finally, they reviewed research on combat effectiveness and "unit cohesion," reaching the common-sense conclusion that it is not necessary to like somebody to work with him or her.
Unfortunately, the Administration, eager to get beyond a losing fight, has capitulated with a false statement that Mr. Nunn's language is "fully consistent" with its own July 19 policy. So now the last hope for fairness and reason is the House.
A pending defense bill has language identical to the Senate's, but more progressive members hope the Rules Committee will allow debate on an amendment that would leave policy on homosexuals in the military to the Administration. That is the best way to go. Cementing the Senate language into law will just make it harder to ease the ban as social attitudes become more enlightened.

 BODY:

Reverse Mortgages
 
Q What are reverse mortgages and how can I find an issuer in the Palm Springs, Calif., area? . . . Helene Morgensterne, Westport, Conn. 

A. With reverse mortgages, a homeowner pledges the equity in a house to a financial institution in return for a stream of fixed payments over a specific period, usually 10 or 20 years. When the homeowner dies or sells the house, the bank is repaid, with interest. Reverse mortgages also usually carry an interest rate that reflects current fixed-mortgage rates for the same term. In addition, there are closing costs.
The number of lenders offering reverse mortgages has grown from a few dozen in the mid-80's to more than 100 in 40 states. Co-op owners are still excluded, however, because they own shares rather than real property.
For more information, contact the Home Equity Information Center of the American Association of Retired Persons. The number is (202) 434-6066. Or send a postcard to: AARP, Home Equity Information Center, 601 E Street N.W., Washington D.C. 20049. The organization offers a free 47-page consumer guide, "Home-Made Money," along with a list of more than 100 reverse-mortgage lenders. The National Center for Home Equity Conversion also offers a 350-page book called "Retirement Income on the House," along with its own lender list. To get both items send $30.45 to: NCHEC, Suite 115, 7373 147th Street West, Apple Valley, Minn. 55124.
 
Taxes on a House That Is Transferred
 
Q My sister is in declining health and has offered to transfer ownership of her home to me. Is a transaction of this type considered a sale or a gift, and how is it taxed? . . . D.R. Walsh, Deer Park, N.Y.
 
Answer: It is a gift, according to Neil O'Keeffe, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service in Manhattan. He said the recipient of the house would be liable for a gift tax of between 18 and 49 percent, depending on the property's value, when the property was transferred.
 
Reallocation Of Co-op Shares
 
Q A group of apartment owners in our co-op who own a majority of the shares want the corporation to reallocate its shares since they believe that the current allocation burdens them with an unfair proportion of the building's expenses. The allocations date back to the building's construction around the turn of the century. While the original allocations gave significant consideration to esthetics, like park view, the complaining owners feel that allocations should more closely reflect the relative size of the apartments.
The corporation was initially advised by its counsel that reallocation was not possible without the consent of all the shareholders to whom additional shares would be assigned. Despite such advice, a shareholder vote passed, over the objection of a minority, in favor of funding research into how such a reallocation could be accomplished or what equivalent means could be designed to shift a greater proportion of the building's expenses onto the objecting minority.
Is it legal for the corporation to pay for outside lawyers and consultants to pursue this goal? . . . Carolyn McIntyre, Brooklyn
 
A Yes. According to Arthur Weinstein, a Manhattan lawyer, under the Federal tax law that governs the definition of a housing co-op, the allocation must reflect a reasonable relationship among the apartments and the relative value of each apartment. He added that reallocations were complex and controversial, but that if there had been a change in circumstances since the original allocation, like changing views, those changes could be reflected in a new allocation -- and it would be an appropriate topic for the corporation to expend its funds on. Any solution, he added, will also have to be accompanied by a broker's opinion that confirms that the new allocations meets the Internal Revenue Service's reasonable-relationship test.
Also, Mr. Weinstein said, a reallocation can be done without the shareholders' unanimous consent, provided that the certificate of incorporation, proprietary lease and by-laws are adhered to.

HEADLINE: Corporate Consolidations Cause a Rise in Office Vacancies

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
JUST five years ago, White Plains had a 6 percent office vacancy rate, the lowest in the nation. Today, however, according to Oncor International, a group of independent brokerage firms in Europe and North America, White Plains has 34.9 percent of empty office space, making it the second highest in the United States in office vacancies and the third highest in the world.
"Only Dallas in Texas, with a vacancy rate of 35.8 percent, and Amsterdam in Europe, with 35.3 percent, are higher than White Plains," said John H. Rostenberg, a partner in Rostenberg-Doern Company, a brokerage firm in Purchase and Stamford that specializes in corporate real estate. Rostenberg-Doern is Oncor's Fairfield-Westchester affiliate. 
 A recent study by Mr. Rostenberg's office, shows vacancy rates in downtown White Plains for office space rising from 28.9 percent at the end of 1992 to 34.9 percent six months later. Absorption rates, comparing the space leased with the space vacated, were a negative 387,576 square feet in the same period.
Mr. Rostenberg said that corporate consolidations, particularly by International Business Machines, put a total of 1.3 million square feet of vacant space on the market, which has had a devastating impact on the county, especially in White Plains.
 
Effect of I.B.M. Plans
 "Much of the empty space in downtown White Plains was the result of I.B.M.'s decision to vacate 320,000 square feet of space at Westchester One," Mr. Rostenberg said, adding that I.B.M.'s plan to leave its international headquarters building of 425,000 square feet at 2000 Purchase Street, in Purchase, and 171,000 square feet more in Tarrytown has hurt, even though overall leasing activity in Westchester has remained steady, with about 600,000 square feet of space leased during the first six months of this year.
"But there may be worse to come," Mr. Rostenberg said, "simply because I.B.M. is still paying rent for leases on space it has already vacated." He added, "That space hasn't shown up in the inventory of vacant space yet, which will make the vacancy rate worse."
Westchester's expanding inventory of unleased space, however, is not limited to the retrenching at I.B.M. Mr. Rostenberg said that on the eastern side of the county, in Rye Brook, Jamaica Water and Power, a conglomerate offering technical services, which goes by the initials J.W.P., has fallen on hard times and is subleasing all of the 75,000 square feet it leased last year. At One North Lexington in White Plains, A.T.&T. plans to vacate 370,000 of the building's 539,000 square feet. Four Gannett Drive, also in White Plains, is now completely vacant.
This, combined with other moves, including the sublease of excess space by United States Tennis Association in Harrison, add up to an empty 649,525 square feet for the eastern half of the county.
By contrast, in Fairfield County, the outlook is much brighter.
"In this tale of two cities, approximately one million square feet of office space was leased during the last six months in Fairfield," Mr. Rostenberg said. "Countywide, in Fairfield the vacancy rate fell from 24.8 at the end of 1992 to 23.0. There were also a number of corporate relocations to Fairfield from New York City, including the largest relocation in many years, which occurred when the Witco Corporation, a chemical company, decided to move its corporate headquarters from Manhattan to 250,000 square feet in Greenwich."
Another major relocation from Manhattan to Connecticut, he observed, was by Dun & Bradstreet to 94,000 square feet of leased space in Westport before its move to its own headquarters in Wilton next year. Also, Walter Karl, list brokers for direct-mail customers, announced plans to move from Westchester to 50,000 square feet of space in Greenwich.
And in Stamford, which at 28.4 percent five years ago had one of the highest vacancy rates in the nation, the current vacancy rate of 21.1 percent continues a downward trend that began two years ago.
Asked how that had happened, Mr. Rostenberg said that about half the deals in Stamford involved companies coming from outside Fairfield County, primarily from New York City and Westchester. "But in Stamford," he said, "a major attempt to split up the big one-company office buildings, making old space new and suitable for medium-sized tenants, was started five years ago. That investment in building stock, aided by aggressive marketing of the space, has paid off handsomely."
He added that he thought that the same attempt could be made to revitalize large buildings in downtown White Plains.
"The largest buildings, such as 360 Hamilton Avenue and Gateway One, could be broken up for multi-tenant use if the owners would make the investment," he said. "This sort of project has already been done to 104 Corporate Park Drive. It's a brand new building, completely rebuilt for medium-size tenants."
He said the prospects for a significant recovery in the Westchester office market this year are doubtful, despite a few bright spots during the first six months. Those encouraging signs include a lease by the container-leasing company Transamerica of 125,000 square feet in the former Nestle building, Research Institute of America's consolidation to 52,000 square feet in Mount Pleasant, Market Data's lease of 30,000 square feet in Rye Brook and Hitachi's signing a lease for more than 14,000 square feet in Tarrytown.
"The long recession, combined with hot interstate competition for tenants, makes it difficult," Mr. Rostenberg said. "This is compounded because Fairfield County is benefiting from a heavily funded economic development effort by the state of Connecticut. For instance, Witco's decision to move to Greenwich was based largely on the $8 million in grants the company received from Connecticut.
 
State Hesitant About Spending
 "Dun & Bradstreet and Walter Karl also received subsidies from the state. By contrast, in Westchester we don't have anything of that magnitude. As a matter of fact, New York State seems hesitant about spending money on a program to woo business here. In Westchester, there has to be more effort made to create a positive atmosphere to attract and retain business. I think we need more involvement from top management, the C.E.O.'s of Westchester companies, in addition to some good tax breaks as an incentive to draw people here."
Carl Austin, head of Austin Corporate Properties in White Plains, also said Westchester is handicapped by not being able to offer meaningful incentive packages to prospective office tenants.
"We are not on a level playing field, especially at a time like this when tenants driven by price and value are an overriding consideration," he said.
Mr. Austin, however, has a somewhat different analysis of the Westchester office vacancy figures.
 
Opportunities Available
 "You have to realize that two prominent large buildings, 360 Hamilton Avenue and I.B.M. International in Purchase, together have a total of about 900,000 square feet, which is 20 percent of the inventory, but they are actually not available to the medium-size user market," Mr. Austin said. "That is because in this weak market the owners of those buildings would rather sell them as is than make the speculative investment in reworking them that is necessary to break them up for 10,000- to 40,000-square foot space for medium-size users."
But he added on a more positive note that he believes opportunities in the Westchester office market have never been better and that wise business concerns will realize it.
"Many medium-size, privately held companies are already being drawn out of Manhattan, taking advantage of the lowest-priced space in Westchester in many years to make long-term advantageous deals."

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW;
Ethnic Look at Love in Three One-Acters

BYLINE: By LEAH D. FRANK

 BODY:
OF all the theaters on Long Island, the only one that consistently presents new, previously unknown works is the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale. Its current production is "Love Italian Style," three one-act plays by the late Robert Bernstein, who for years was producer of the Long Island Concert Hall.
"Love Italian Style" consists of two fluffy comedies, "Arrivederci!" and "The Importance of Being Rocky," and one very sad vignette, "The Burden." What binds the disparate pieces together is mother love, in the best sense of that term. 
 In "Arrivederci!" a pragmatic woman named Celia is about to marry a kind but boring banker primarily because he is in a financial position to be able to take care of her and her two children. But when her former boyfriend, a penniless unemployed Italian actor walks through the door, her once-clear vision of marriage begins to cloud over.
On one hand Dino is good looking, full of fun and exciting, but completely irresponsible and poor. On the other hand Celia has promised the stodgy banker, Andy, that she will marry him. Andy is plump and dull but kind, and his middle name might as well be Responsbility. Andy, Dino, Celia and Celia's two precocious children argue all of the pros and cons of each suitor until all but one is satisfied with the ultimate decision.
"The Importance of Being Rocky," takes place when a boxer preparing for a championship bout comes home to find a letter from a lawyer naming him as correspondent in a divorce case.
When Rocky's wife, Rosie, also finds the letter, she stops him from taking their daughter to her elocution lessons and instead prepares him a last supper. For the philandering Rocky, the saying, "Till death do us part," becomes an immediate and urgent threat.
The final act, "The Burden," is about the anguish of the mother of a severely retarded boy who has to decide whether to institutionalize him. Because the situation created in "The Burden" is never fully resolved, it is more of a long tormented slice-of-life scene than a play with a beginning, middle and end.
Sunny Taylor is the heart and soul of the evening, as she plays the mother in all three acts. She is delightful as the firm-minded Celia, who is tired of hard work and who has already had one disastrous passion-filled marriage.
Ms. Taylor easily turns from the self-controlled Celia into the furious Rosie, who would rather see her foolish husband dead than know that he had been dishonoring his marriage vows. Finally, Ms. Taylor gives a bravura performance as the mother who cannot see that she is destroying her family to hold on to her hope for a child who was born incapable of even minimal awareness of the world around him.
Anthony Bellucci shows his adaptability in the roles of Celia's earnest suitor, Andy, and then as Tony, the anxious fight manager. Mr. Bellucci drops his lighthearted mood when he undertakes the role of the overworked husband who is struggling to pay his disabled son's extensive medical bills.
Matt Farrago is the dumb fighter whose championship bout turns out to be with his wife. Mr. Farrago, who is a professional fighter off stage, has a charming manner and a natural stage presence.
The Arena Players runs a Performing Arts Institute, and the four children in the casts have been chosen from those classes. Michael Hirschhorn, Erin Rose Massot and Sarah Hirschhorn give creditable performances in small but pivotal parts.
The fourth, Jeremy Tufano, plays the retarded boy who is the title character in "The Burden." He does such an excellent job holding a blank stare that some people in the audience questioned whether he was really brain damaged. Be assured that Jeremy is a normal child with an uncanny ability to appear vacant and helpless.
"Love Italian Style" has been directed by Frederic De Feis, who works hard, albeit not always successfully, to cover up many of the flaws in the scripts. Over all this is a painless evening of theater.
That it is an evening of new plays and that it features Ms. Taylor in the lead roles makes it worthwhile. It will continue at the Main Stage Theater through next Sunday.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Dr. George A. Clark Jr.;
Lessons to Be Learned From the Birds

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
DR. GEORGE A. CLARK JR. was recently awarded the Mabel Osgood Wright Award by the Connecticut Ornithological Association for "outstanding contributions to the study of birds in Connecticut." He has been the state ornithologist since 1981 and is editing for publication an "Atlas of Breeding Birds of Connecticut."
A professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Connecticut since 1965, Dr. Clark has studied birds throughout North and South America, Africa and Australia. He earned his bachelor's degree from Amherst College in 1957 and his Ph.D. from Yale University in 1964. 
 The Wright award, named for a Fairfield resident who was prominent in the early days of the Audubon Society, was given to recognize Dr. Clark's work coordinating surveys on the status of Connecticut birds. Dr. Clark talked about birding at his office in the biology building at UConn recently. Here are some excerpts from the conversation.
Q. : Is birding becoming more popular?
A. There are a lot more casual birders, and this is reflected in the number of people going to meetings. On a national scale, even a meeting on a topic as specialized as raptors, say -- hawks and owls -- we'll get 1,000 people sometimes. Then we have things like the American Birding Association, which has a large membership. At a state-level meeting, we might see upward of 200 people. Twenty years ago, we didn't even have such meetings, there wasn't such a thing as a Connecticut Ornithological Association.
Q. Why is the interest increasing?
A. In birding, there's the excitement of something new all the time. It gets you away from the things you have to deal with all the time -- if you're sick of hearing about the economy, go out and watch birds, because you don't have to think about the economy. You find people from all professions getting into this, highly trained physicians and lawyers to people washing dishes in restaurants. It gets people out of their daily routine, gets them close to nature, gets them a little exercise. I don't think most of them get into it because they're environmental activists, but they get interested in the environment once they start birding.
Q. What have your studies shown about the status of some of the migratory songbirds that summer here and winter in the tropics?
A. You have to look at population trends over a period of decades to see any changes, but certainly we're not seeing some of the migration flights that we saw in the 1950's or 60's, or even into the 70's. Things like radar studies of birds crossing the Gulf of Mexico show about half as many nights with large number of targets, which indicates a decline. Now maybe these declines can be explained away. Perhaps the birds are moving in some other way, or they've relocated, but it looks like there's an overall decline. We have other kinds of data to show that. We do roadside surveys during June. You stop every half-mile and listen for three minutes, mark down how many birds you hear, and those kinds of assays also show the numbers of birds are declining. We have several possibilities, and a lot of uncertainty about the exact cause, but certainly tropical deforestation is causing a loss of habitat on their wintering ground. And up here as well, we have more urbanization and suburbanization. A lot of them are woodland species, so the number of neotropical migrants that you're going to get is going to be down along roads that have been built up.
Q. : But many areas of the state are still pretty rural. Will a house every few hundred feet really affect the birds?
A. A lot of the neotropical birds are forest birds, and if you put a house in your habitat, even if you leave trees in position, they're not going to nest near it. And typically what happens is, you have house cats associated with human dwellings, and raccoons are attracted. Nest predation goes up, and so does nest parasitism because of things like the brown-headed cowbird. On the other hand, if you go into the woodland tracts that are less disturbed, there's been no decline in the neotropical migrants -- we have some really good studies from the Litchfield area, where they have actually gone up a little bit.
Q. What are some of the predicted climactic changes going to mean?
A. Some of the projections show us undergoing a dramatic warming. The problem is, our knowledge of global climate is still pretty limited. One doesn't want to get too alarmist, but there are warning signs, and we should be very cautious about what we do globally, because if we have an abrupt increase in temperatures we're going to lose a lot of plants, and we're going to lose a lot of animal species that rely on the plants, including birds. They won't be able to change their migration and nesting patterns quickly enough to keep up with the change in temperatures. Over millennia temperatures have moved up and down naturally, and animals have moved as the temperatures have changed, but we've not been exposed to extremely rapid kinds of changes.
Q. What species are of most concern in Connecticut?
A. One species that's getting a lot of attention right now is the worm-eating warbler, in terms of research. It's sort of a greenish bird with a light crown, and it winters down in the Caribbean. It's considered to be especially sensitive to the kind of disturbances you have when there's development going on in wooded areas.
The Federally endangered species right now are the roseate tern and the piping plover, so they're getting as much attention as anything. One of the problems is when the numbers get really low, you don't have enough to study. Grasshopper sparrows, for instance: About the only major nesting ground now is Bradley International Airport.
Q. Is there any quantifiable change taking place in the mix of Connecticut birds?
A. Certainly grassland species like the brown thrasher are on the decline, and birds that live in shrubby areas seem to be somewhat on the decline. Things like the yellow-breasted chat used to be pretty much all over the place, particularly in the coastal areas, and this year I don't know of a single nesting taking place. It's not due to development, it's because agriculture is on the wane in Connecticut, so the grasslands and shrubland have been allowed to return to forest. Around the turn of the century about 70 percent of the land in Connecticut was farm fields, but today about 60 percent is forest. And the agriculture that is left is very neat, often weed free, so the natural foods for birds are just not there.
Q. Are there many species that have entirely disappeared recently?
A. There are some birds that have pretty much disappeared in terms of being reported, or they have disappeared as breeders, but they still are sighted as migrants -- something like the sedge wren, which once in a while still breeds in the state, but it's certainly down.
Q. How much diversity is there remaining in Connecticut?
A. Our species list for one individual in a day is as high as 170. That takes about 24 hours. You start at night, picking off the things you hear calling, even if you don't see them very well. It's fairly easy to do over 100 a day, without any particular strain. Our state list is pushing upward of 400. There's a lot of diversity, and we're continually getting new species for the state, most of them birds of the Southwest or the South that get blown in. We just had a tropical kingbird come up, which is normally in the Southwest and down into Latin America.
Q. What makes some species so much more successful than others?
A. A lot of the birds doing real well now are human-associated birds, such as the starling. They were introduced from Europe, and have spread all over the country. They nest in holes, often man provided, whether birdhouses or buildings. And it feeds very well in association with domestic livestock. It's a bird that has millennia of association with people in the Old World, comes over here and finds people living in pretty much the same way, and did very well.
The Canada goose has done tremendously well, but if you go back to 1960 they weren't here at all. We had Canada geese, but they were migrating through Connecticut, maybe wintering with us a little bit. The Canada goose has become a bit of a plague on golf courses and playing fields.
Q. : Why should we care what happens to birds?
A. From a bird lover's point of view, and it could be a very selfish point of view, they just want to keep seeing these things. From a human standpoint, if we lose a single species, such as the Cape May warbler, it probably won't impact us directly, but it's a bad sign, because it's indicative of environmental degradation in general.
Birds have been useful as indices of environmental conditions for a long time. Think back to the episode that we went through when we used chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides like DDT, where birds were a good indicator that this was having a major environmental impact. There's still some problems associated with lawn care, where we've had some bird mortality. In general, as we lose birds, we're probably contaminating the environment.
Q. What's your favorite bird?
A. That's a tough one. I guess the one I'm looking at at the moment is often my favorite, a black-capped chickadee, or the ruby-throated hummingbird, which is migrating through the area now, and they're just great. I think one of the things that really attracts me is if I see something I haven't seen in a while, or if I see a bird doing something that I didn't know they did, I get excited.
Q. What's the most exciting sighting that you've had?
A. One of the most spectacular things I've seen is at Cape May, N.J. Back some decades ago when the flights were really spectacular you'd have thousands of warblers at once flying over you. You can't begin to identify them all, and they're just pouring past you. In the time it takes you to figure out what one is, hundreds of others have gone by you. You're looking at maybe 20, 25 different species flying by at one time.

 BODY:

21ST CENTURY CAPITALISM
By Robert Heilbroner.
175 pp. New York: W.W. Norton & Company. $17.95. 
 IN economics as in other disciplines there are Big Thinkers (as Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in the field, once called John Kenneth Galbraith in what was not interpreted as a flattering comment). The big thinkers are contrasted with the numerous ranks of plodding little thinkers, content to work at establishing small truths.
Robert Heilbroner is a big thinker and I admire him for it. Early in his distinguished career -- 40 years ago now -- Mr. Heilbroner gave us "The Worldly Philosophers," a remarkable tour de force on big thinkers in the history of economics, Adam Smith, Malthus, David Ricardo, Karl Marx, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes and Joseph Schumpeter. In "21st Century Capitalism," an expanded version of lectures he gave last year at Massey College, co-sponsored by the Canadian Broadcasting Company, Mr. Heilbroner applies some of those economists' perceptions, and his own, to the question of where we are and where we may be going in the post-Communist world.
And, perhaps too rare among economists, the rendering of these perceptions is in a style largely penetrable and pleasing to ordinary mortals.
Mr. Heilbroner does not really presume to predict much of our future. His is the more modest ambition of understanding the system in which we live and the principles of its development. Capitalism, which now seems well on the way to dominating the entire world, remains one of many systems that have existed in history, he reminds us, one that has evolved over some centuries and may be expected to continue to evolve. Among its salient characteristics "from the mid-19th century on" is a "sense of immanent change," which goes along with the notion of progress: we have seen vast improvements, and we have come to expect things to continue to get better. The "feelings of dismay that are so much part of our contemporary frame of mind," like the growing social alienation and political disaffection in the United States today that Mr. Heilbroner addresses only generally, he attributes to the sudden sense that life is no longer getting better and that we are seeing the first generation that does not live better than its parents.
Going back to Adam Smith and his "celebration of a Society of Perfect Liberty," Mr. Heilbroner identifies the separation of the economy and the state as central to capitalism and "the division of power between two realms" as indispensable to "the state of explicit political liberty we loosely call 'democracy.' " He also notes important failings of capitalism: its inability to guarantee jobs for all who want them or to handle "externalities" -- the effects of economic activities on those other than the people undertaking them, for example "the higher laundry bills and health costs of people living in Pittsburgh before the pollution of the steel mills was brought under control."
"Negative externalities," particularly the pollution of our land, water and air by private enterprises operating by methods that entail the least cost to them, cry out for public, that is, government, intervention, whether in the form of taxes, subsidies or (at worst) regulation. But in arguing that global warming calls for major government planning over the next century, Mr. Heilbroner may inadvertently confirm the danger of government action. Many, such as the historian Paul Kennedy, whom Mr. Heilbroner cites at some length, do see "good reason to worry about global warming." But some leading economists, like Thomas Schelling, have denounced unfounded worry that could push politicians into costly misguided ventures. The scope, if not the existence, of the problem remains, after all, a matter of serious scientific inquiry. Global warming may be one of those issues that does now justify another study commission, but perhaps no further intervention in the market.
As for full employment, Mr. Heilbroner explains why capitalism lacks a smoothly functioning automatic mechanism to guarantee it. In what was in a sense a fundamental, radical attack, Keynes rejected the classical notion that falling wages would lead employers to increase hiring or that lower interest rates would always generate enough business investment to keep the economy prosperous and provide for our future. Yet, as Mr. Heilbroner points out, in showing the way to solve the problem by government spending -- and, yes, budget deficits -- Keynes gave capitalism critical new support.
Mr. Heilbroner regrets the erosion of employment goals, which he relates to fear of inflation: public investment may increase employment, but it can raise prices as well. He is undoubtedly right that fear of inflation, particularly by powerful financial interests with the ear of the Federal Reserve, has inhibited Government action against unemployment. But it is a pity that Mr. Heilbroner seems to suggest that inflation is likely to prove a real problem that might properly limit Government action to create more jobs.
THERE has, in fact, been little inflation in United States history, aside from wars and supply shocks like those related to oil prices, and they have little to do with government spending; we clearly have little or no inflation now. I doubt, too, that the demands of organized labor have had much to do with inflation in this country -- their membership now covers less than 20 percent of the work force. I doubt, further, that having union representatives sit on corporate boards, which Mr. Heilbroner suggests, would help promote noninflationary growth. And his recommended checks on inflationary tendencies -- increases in sales taxes and the introduction of value-added taxes -- would reduce real purchasing power. But they would certainly raise prices as they raise costs.
In his thoughtful and provocative conclusion Mr. Heilbroner proposes that the collapse of the Soviet system, hailed as a victory for human freedom, was also a defeat for human aspirations. The idea that socialism offered an opportunity to guide society to still greater progress suffered a crushing blow, leaving many without any alternative path that could be considered "up." In his prognosis for the 21st century, Mr. Heilbroner argues that some form of socialism should still be considered a possibility. "If, as seems likely, there is a threshold of necessary acquisitiveness to maintain the system's elan vital, so there is also a limit beyond which acquisitiveness no longer serves, and may well disserve, the adaptability of the order," he writes. "There is also a limit beyond which indifference turns into a dysfunctional social injustice."
Mr. Heilbroner laments the failure of the United States Government to account separately for investment spending, as do private industry and almost all other governments. As President Clinton has tried to explain, without clear success, all "spending" is not the same. The crux of Mr. Heilbroner's argument is then this: capitalism is likely to remain the dominant social order as we enter the next millennium, and public investment, presumably in education, training and basic research as well as in infrastructure, and financed by both taxes and prudent borrowing, is the key to its success. One would be foolish to dismiss either proposition.

HEADLINE: The United States of Asylum

BYLINE: By Ted Conover; Ted Conover is the author of "Coyotes: A Journey Through the Secret World of America's Illegal Aliens."

 BODY:
Dong Yishen looks a lot better in person than in his lawyer's photo of him. The picture, taken the night of his arrival in Queens on the Golden Venture, shows him wearing a thin, ragged blazer and dark turtleneck, his hair still plastered down from the Atlantic Ocean. Now, in the crisp blue uniform of the Salisbury Interim Correctional Facility in Pennsylvania, he looks composed, if a bit nervous.
Fellow prisoners in the visitors' room of the medium-security jail stare as he bows to me and my interpreter. They are in for crimes ranging from burglary to drug offenses. But Dong is a different kind of prisoner -- accused not of any crime but of "an administrative violation" of United States immigration rules. Technically, he and the other 60 Chinese held at the jail are free to leave -- but only for China. And Dong, who is 34, does not want to go back to China. 
 "In the countryside, if you are a farmer and your first child is a girl the Government won't argue too much if you have a second child after five years. But my second one was also a girl. In China we really want to have a son."
Dong and his wife kept trying. To hide from the Government, they had their third child in a distant village. It was the long-awaited son. For the first few years, he was raised in the house of childless friends. "But then I admitted that this was my own son -- he is now 6 years old." As a result, says Dong, the authorities, whom he barely eluded, destroyed his furniture and knocked down his house.
Like four other Golden Venture survivors I interviewed, Dong is sharp on the details of his persecution but vague about the smugglers. The trip was arranged for him "by friends." He claims he doesn't know exactly how much they paid up front or how much he has to pay off.
One reason for his reticence may be the presence of Chinese "enforcers" in the jail -- the Immigration and Naturalization Service suspects that several were on board, and presumes they are mixed in among those imprisoned. He will say that during a horrific storm near the Cape of Good Hope the boat, battered by 50-foot waves for seven or eight hours, nearly sank.
Though his life has been completely sedentary since he left China's Fujian Province six months ago, he has strong arms, farmer's arms. As we stand up to say goodbye, we shake hands, and Dong will not release his grip. He is shaking my hand with both of his and speaking at me instead of to the interpreter.
"The life I had was not good," he says. "I was so poor. . . . If I'm not allowed to stay, I will have to commit suicide."
It is hard to come face to face with someone in such straits and not feel sympathy. And yet who is to know if he is telling the truth? There is only his word. Dong came here with high hopes. President George Bush, in fact, specifically encouraged this kind of flight in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square killings and pressure from the antiabortion lobby. Dong had reason to think he might qualify for the formal status called political asylum -- refuge from political persecution.
But China has nearly 1.2 billion people, more than a fifth of the planet's total; 500 million are of childbearing age. "Is the United States prepared to let them all in?" asks Ling-Chi Wang, associate professor of Asian-American studies at the University of California at Berkeley. More broadly, in terms of the asylum debate, does Dong's flight from birth control really qualify as political persecution? And if so, is political asylum an idea that we as a country can still stand behind?
KYROCKETING ASYLUM applications and the abuse of the system by nefarious figures have brought asylum into the news. Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, whose followers are accused of bombing the World Trade Center, has applied for asylum in order to prevent his removal to Egypt. Mir Aimal Kansi, the Pakistani suspected of killing two C.I.A. employees outside their headquarters with an AK-47 early this year, had purchased his weapon using documents obtained with his official work authorization, supplied by the Government to most asylum applicants.
Asylum is much in the news because the average citizen lumps it together with all forms of immigration, and in these recession-plagued times, the pendulum is making a swing toward intolerance of immigrants. It is one more component of the fear that we've "lost control of our borders."
In contrast to many European countries, however, asylum here adds only a sliver to overall numbers of immigrants. A hundred thousand people applied for asylum in the last fiscal year (the approval rate is about 30 percent), compared with almost a million who immigrated legally in other Government programs (chart, page 74).
Notwithstanding recent bad press, asylum, at least in its conception, is a beautiful idea. The notion of granting protection to those fleeing persecution gained strength after World War II from the widespread agreement that what had happened to the Jews would never be allowed to happen again to anybody, anywhere. Countries that signed the United Nations 1951 Convention Relating to Refugees, and its 1967 Protocol, agreed to protect those who met the documents' definition of a refugee: a person with "a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion." Asylum is offered to refugees who make it to a "safe country" on their own. In the United States, it is administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. (The State Department has a separate program that brings over groups of refugees from selected countries.)
World War II also created a world divided into East and West, and asylum, conceived of as ideology-free, soon became an instrument of cold-war politics. Until the collapse of the Soviet Union, asylum was a weapon used to "embarrass our enemies," says Arthur C. Helton, director of the Refugee Project for the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. Asylees, as they're called -- whether ballet dancers, physicists or fighter pilots -- were testimony to the superiority of our system.
The "clear anti-Communist ideology . . . favored only those who appeared to share it," wrote Gil Loescher and John A. Scanlan in their book "Calculated Kindness: Refugees and America's Half-Open Door, 1945-Present." "Cubans were the principal beneficiary of this double standard. The Haitians were the principal losers." Eastern Europeans fleeing Communist regimes were practically all approved for asylum; victims of violence in Central American countries that had the support of the United States Government were routinely denied.
Now that the cold war is no more, replaced by what might be called the new world disorder, what is going to be acceptable as an evil to flee from?
Fidel Castro may no longer be on the list, as a Cuban airline captain has discovered, after he diverted his plane to Miami last December and, along with all but 5 of the 53 people on board, requested political asylum. Instead of granting his request, Federal law-enforcement officials, with Cuba's help, are pursuing criminal charges against the airline captain. This change may reflect not only the thaw in relations with Cuba but also a growing suspicion that asylum applicants, rather than fleeing persecution, are simply seeking entry to the developed world.
Accustomed to measuring dissent from Communism, officials who preside over asylum cases are suddenly faced with a bewildering variety of persecution claims. A homosexual escaping from death squads in Brazil . . . a woman from Africa who does not want to undergo the cruel, potentially crippling procedure called clitoridectomy . . . a Peruvian who has aroused the wrath of the Shining Path . . . a Guatemalan union worker threatened with death for organizing against the Government . . . a Christian Sudanese fleeing from Islamic fundamentalists. Many of the world's people, rather than suffer in silence, would prefer to live somewhere else. Like here.
Since millions fear for their lives in many lands, political asylum now raises a much larger immigration question: How many asylees can America take in? And which ones?
PEOPLE WHO ARRIVE AT KENNEDY International Airport without proper papers and apply for asylum are often released, pending their hearings, because of a lack of space at the Wackenhut detention facility, a bleak converted warehouse run by a private company for the immigration service, in Queens, near the airport. Occasionally someone will arrive when one of the 125 beds is empty. Such was the luck of Luis.
Wackenhut, a building intended for goods, not people, has no outdoor exercise yard and practically no windows. Luis, a welder from Peru, has lived 10 months under artificial light, leaving the facility only once, for a hearing in Manhattan. His appeal of an immigration judge's ruling against him was recently turned down.
"I've changed a lot here," says Luis. (His last name is withheld to protect him from persecution should he be returned to Peru.) "I had a big fear of speaking openly, but now less. I want the authorities here to pay attention. The injustice gives me courage. I worry that our cries for justice are being silenced."
Once he begins to talk there is no holding him back. I have seen the slums of Lima and know the place where Luis lives. To see a man like him -- bursting with life and moral outrage -- come out of that environment is astonishing enough. But to see him in this country and yet not in this country, penned within a block of metal and concrete, fills me with despair.
Luis's story begins in one of the sprawling poor communities known as pueblos jovenes (young towns) on the outskirts of Lima. There he became a leader in a civic group that tried to secure services like electricity and water for the city's half-million people. The group's efforts to help the poor have been recognized by the Pope and the United Nations, but its continuing success has attracted the unwanted attention of Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, Peru's violent Maoist guerrilla movement.
"They began to infiltrate our assemblies. We noticed that the ideas being suggested were the ideas of terrorists -- that we start an armed struggle. They talked of Communism. But we had never spoken of armed struggle. Our only weapons are work and truth and the faith we have. Seeing that we wouldn't help, the Shining Path started putting on more pressure. Their fliers said that anyone who didn't support the armed struggle was a traitor and would die. But we held firm."
The Shining Path's campaign of intimidation escalated in the late 1980's with the execution of various directors of the group. "One guy they took to a central park and machine-gunned in front of his family. Another time they threw dynamite into a house and many innocents died. They blow up banks, schools and hospitals. There were 2,000 of us leaders when it began. Many were killed or had to flee. Some of us kept fighting."
Luis says he has "always had the courage to face the bad." But the Shining Path learned that he opposed them from his work counseling teen-agers involved with drugs. Soon messages began to be left at his house, telling him to resign his leadership position. His father, in another part of Peru, was also threatened. In a third note delivered to his home, they said they would kill him. Luis, his wife and three children moved to a safe house.
Fearful for his life and for his family, Luis secured a plane ticket, passport and false visa from his associates. But in February his application for asylum in the United States was denied by a judge who, noting that Luis had claimed persecution on account of "political opinion," cited a State Department memo on Peru that stated Sendero Luminoso's "choice of victims does not appear to be the result of their personal political views. Rather, the Sendero uses force to intimidate and recruit, to coerce financial support, and to retaliate against those inside and outside the Government who are perceived as opposing its goals or undermining its support."
In other words, the Shining Path singled him out for his position, not for his views. But the State Department memo also contradicts itself. If Sendero retaliates against those "who are perceived as opposing its goals," isn't it singling them out for their views? Luis's lawyer appealed, and recently the Board of Immigration Appeals turned him down. Luis's lawyer is appealing again.
Meanwhile, Luis waits in Wackenhut. "I have the hope to return to Peru, to continue my work someday, but I can't right now. I came here to escape death."
I EXIT WACKENHUT, AND re-enter my privileged position as a citizen of one of the world's prosperous countries, one troubled much less with political ideology, these days, than with the question, mainly, of how much do we share? Are these people our brothers and sisters? And if not, what do we owe a stranger?
"The growth of a global economy has emphasized rather than reduced inequality between nations," says a new report by the United Nations Population Fund, and the number of migrants worldwide is at least 100 million. This migration, away from trouble and poverty and toward peacefulness and opportunity, "could become the human crisis of our age," says the report.
This is not to imply that a hundred million people are packing their bags for America. Gregg A. Beyer, director of asylum for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, uses the example of Latin America to illustrate that most people would probably rather stay home. "From settled countries like Chile and Bolivia, we get very few applications," he notes (60 and 93, respectively, in the past 10 months). "It is the countries in turmoil -- like Peru and Colombia -- that produce the greatest number" (2,529 and 998, respectively). Beyer's program handles 90 percent of the country's asylum cases -- those who apply on their own; the rest -- those who are apprehended -- fall within the purview of the immigration court.
Still, the numbers are rising rapidly, and if the asylum apparatus is a reflection of the way Americans think about it, it is a subject we find difficult to think about at all. From 1968 to 1975 the United States averaged only 200 applications per year. The startling rise in applications since -- 130,000 are expected this year -- has until recently been met with bureaucratic paralysis. A ballyhooed asylum corps of 150 specially trained officers (Germany has 3,000; Sweden, 800) inherited a backlog of 114,000 cases the day they started work in 1991. There is now a backlog of 300,000 cases.
Those awaiting adjudication are not deportable and, in most cases, are given a work authorization. This means that the backlog itself now attracts spurious claims. Apply for asylum in the United States, it is known, and you can pretty much plan to stay. Depending on where you enter the byzantine process, if you are denied, up to four appeals are possible. Some cases have been pending for 12 years.
But with rising sentiment against immigration and given the notoriety of the recent asylum cases, reform is on the horizon. "We cannot and will not surrender our border to those who wish to exploit our history of compassion and justice," said President Clinton at a White House ceremony in July announcing a package of immigration reforms.
"Expedited exclusion," which deals with asylum, provides for adjudication within a few days for those arriving at airports without documents and for boat people like Dong Yishen. As the term indicates, the emphasis is on moving people out quickly.
In addition, the President has instructed the Immigration and Naturalization Service to come up with, by the end of this month, new procedures to streamline its unwieldy bureaucracy and to curb its worst abuses. According to Gregg Beyer, these could include a time limit on applying for asylum (there presently is none), a withholding of work authorization from all but those who are granted asylum, and enforcement of the idea of "country of first asylum." Under this last restriction, foreigners who have passed through a country that has a procedure for providing asylum will be returned to that country, if possible.
These reforms -- introduced recently in the Senate by Edward M. Kennedy and in the House by Jack Brooks, Democrat from Texas -- appear to enjoy broad bipartisan support. But they also have their critics. Warren R. Leiden, executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, notes that if Clinton's "expedited exclusion" becomes law, it will be practically impossible for an airport asylum-seeker to be represented by an attorney, since it takes time to find lawyers, who may need more than a week to prepare their cases. The attorney can make a difference: a 1987 General Accounting Office study noted that applicants with attorneys were three times more likely to succeed in proceedings before an immigration judge.
Lucas Guttentag, director of the Immigrants' Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, worries that the new hurdles will result in bona fide applicants being summarily returned. "Experience has shown that persons who were found by the I.N.S. not to have a credible fear initially were later granted asylum under a full hearing," he says. Equally troubling, he adds, is "the absence of judicial review and the attempt to strip the courts of any power to oversee the entire process, because it attempts to insulate the I.N.S. from any independent judicial oversight." On many occasions, courts have found the enforcement-minded immigration service to have abridged immigrant rights.
Doubtless one goal of the Clinton reform effort is to send a signal to citizens who fear America has lost control of the borders and to foreign nationals hoping the same thing. But even if the President succeeds in curbing the worst asylum abuses -- like the ease in claiming asylum at Kennedy Airport and allowing Chinese claiming persecution under the one-child policy to enter -- he will not have touched the underlying shortcomings in the system.
Those applying for asylum upon arriving at an airport or who get caught trying to get in on a boat account for only about 10 percent of the total number of asylum applicants. The rest, who apply once they are in the country (having entered legally on a visa, for example, or illegally across the border) will not be affected by the changes. The backlog continues to grow. And the number of asylum officers remains woefully inadequate.
A Congressional staff member who helped frame the Refugee Act of 1980, which gave a real-life commitment to America's symbolic support of refugee protection, recalls that the country was then receiving a little more than 2,000 asylum applications a year. "Let's double it," he said, making a worst-case projection; and Congress foresaw some 5,000 annually. Instead, 26,000 were received the first year.
Unless more money and thought are given this problem, the increase in world refugee numbers will guarantee that America continues its historic pattern of unpreparedness.
IN THE BASEMENT OFFICES OF Central American Legal Assistance in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, I meet Vicente Osorio, his wife, Maria, and their 8-month-old daughter. Of the 300,000 people in the asylum backlog, 145,000 are from either Guatemala or El Salvador -- a result of the exodus from those countries in the 1980's and lawsuits that forced the Immigration and Naturalization Service to rehear their cases.
Osorio is a short, round man of strong opinions. A street cleaner, he was on the executive board of a municipal workers' union when it got into a dispute with the Guatemalan Government. After the union called a strike that the Government termed illegal, 72 union members were selectively fired, including Osorio. In response, the union began a long campaign, in the news media and on the streets, to win support for their cause. As the campaign geared up, union members began getting killed or abducted.
"Jose Mercedes Sotz was beaten, and three months later, as he and his child walked to a bus stop, his child, 3 years old, was shot and paralyzed," he says. "Other leaders were killed. Some were kidnapped. Others fled. My friend Rufino Reyes, may he rest in peace, died fighting. He was working on a union case at the administration building and he won. Two blocks away from there, after leaving, he was stabbed." (In Osorio's asylum application there are documents from Amnesty International and Americas Watch attesting to this violence.)
Osorio started receiving threats. A man in the office of the municipal government said Osorio should stop his organizing or he would get "disappeared." Written death threats followed, delivered to his home. "I didn't want to leave my wife a widow. Though we were people of bravery and strength, we would only be martyrs if we stayed." The Osorios fled Guatemala, leaving the children with their grandmother. Vicente and Maria Osorio's fourth child, the 8-month-old, was born in the United States.
The Osorios' initial application for asylum was denied, as was their first appeal. According to immigration officials, "the fundamental nature" of Vicente Osorio's dispute with the Guatemalan Government was economic, concerning wages and the reinstatement of workers. "The possible existence of a generalized 'political' motive underlying the Government's action is inadequate to establish that the respondent fears persecution on account of political opinion."
The Osorios' lawyer is appealing to a Federal Court of Appeals.
EXACTLY WHAT constitutes political persecution?
Sometimes it's hard to tell. Sadruddin Aga Khan, the former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, wrote recently in The International Herald Tribune that the identity of refugees has become blurred. Many are "victims of complex socioeconomic and political crises. . . . They may not be pushed out at the end of a rifle or with the threat of execution looming over them, but population pressure, regional conflicts, environmental degradation and absence of work opportunities combine to encourage if not force them to leave."
In San Francisco in July, probably for the first time in the United States, an immigration judge granted asylum to a homosexual Brazilian fleeing "antigay death squad gangs, who are often joined by the police in their massacres of gays." France recently recognized genital mutilation as a form of persecution in the asylum case of a woman from West Africa. Should these claims be accepted?
Such new directions, says Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, represent "a backdoor immigration program for people who are displeased and dispossessed, of which there are billions." "When you get into these gray areas where people are fleeing a status" -- i.e., a sexual preference -- "or a cultural, or an economic repression, you are dealing with the kind of generalized dissatisfaction that our refugee and asylum laws cannot handle, and it's impractical to think they ever could," he says.
The A.C.L.U.'s Guttentag says Stein "betrays an appalling ignorance" of both the facts and the law and the international standards regarding refugee protection. "The Tenorio decision, if he's read it, reflects a very careful analysis of the actual facts in Brazil, the kinds of threats and attacks to which this person and gay persons in Brazil are actually subjected," says Guttentag. "It was not a person fleeing because of their status. It was a person fleeing because of the discrimination and persecution and the physical threats that that person has specifically suffered."
Though immigration law is based upon benchmark standards like the "well-founded fear of persecution" (echoing language in the United Nations Convention) and guided by the occasional Supreme Court ruling, most precedents are set by the Board of Immigration Appeals, in Falls Church, Va. Some lawyers complain that many of the board's decisions are subjective and increasingly restrictive. "They are defining persecution out of existence," says Anne Pilsbury of Central American Legal Assistance. " 'Persecution' is not an easily definable term," wrote Loescher and Scanlan, "and always derives some of its meaning from the political perspectives of those employing it."
Western Europe has always accepted asylum-seekers in far greater numbers than the United States, but even there the doors are closing. There was a moment following World War II when the world decided that asylum was the right thing to do. It is still the right thing to do. But in the world of the 1990's, Americans are being forced to rethink the implications of that promise.
AT WILLIAM OCHAN'S hearing before an immigration judge in Newark, things have suddenly taken a bad turn. Ochan, 29, is a Christian from southern Sudan. The radical Islamic Government of northern Sudan, says Africa Watch, has for nine years waged "a war in the south of extreme brutality" to turn the Sudan into an Islamic state "by whatever means necessary." "The policy has resulted in the suppression of all forms of civil society, the arrest, detention and torture of dissidents, and the relocation and deprivation of hundreds of thousands of people."
One of the displaced, according to his own testimony, is William Ochan.
He became a refugee, he says, the year he was born; his parents, fearing oppression by Muslims, fled with their children to Uganda. After a truce, he returned to the Sudan at age 11 to live with his grandfather, a pastor and headmaster. While his brother joined the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, the armed Christian guerrilla resistance, William Ochan opted for peaceful resistance. Still, the demonstrations he led landed him in jail in Juba, where during his interrogation soldiers hung him by cords tied to his fingers. His left middle finger was mangled as a result. He shows it to the judge, who describes it for the record. She seems moved by his testimony.
Ochan's application is also supported by a dean's-list record at two New Jersey colleges (he supported himself with two full-time jobs while studying), active participation in church, an Op-Ed piece he wrote on the Sudan's crisis that was published in The Los Angeles Times. His lawyer has even brought a video of Ochan being interviewed by Charles Kuralt.
But now the Immigration and Naturalization Service lawyer representing the Government has found a serious discrepancy in his story. It turns out that Ochan was first interviewed five years ago, after sneaking in on a boat from Turkey and while living in a Newark homeless shelter. At the time, she points out, he submitted a written asylum request that mentioned nothing about his finger and in which he claimed to have escaped from the infamous Cobra Prison in Khartoum during a celebrated jailbreak. She submits this statement as Exhibit 7.
Ochan confers with his lawyer, who is upset because she is unaware of the earlier statement. He says that, over the course of five years, he forgot. Today, in any event, he admits that he has never been to Khartoum. He made that up, he says, because at his initial interview the immigration officials were openly hostile. They seemed not to have heard of the Sudan, and they asked if he was fleeing Communism, which has hardly been a factor there for two decades.
"I put in Khartoum because it is more famous than Juba," he explains. "I needed to impress them somehow." As for the finger, he says he didn't mention it in the written statement because he had already discussed it during the interview.
But the judge is concerned. Consistency is crucial in asylum hearings because of the frequent paucity of other evidence to support a claim of persecution. She had hoped to issue an oral decision from the bench today, she says, but "credibility is now such an obvious issue. Exhibit 7 has opened up a can of worms."
I have got to know Ochan over the past few weeks, most recently at a demonstration he organized at the United Nations, on July 31, to publicize the persecution of Christians in the war in the Sudan, and I sympathize with him as we walk to the elevator.
"When will they give me back my life?" he asks. "I am like their prisoner."
At the same time, I doubt I will ever know him well. Asylum-seekers, most of them so alone in the world and so at risk, have many secrets. I wonder with him, as I wondered with Dong, whether I appear as just another representative of The System, another person to impress. In his shoes, what would I do? All I can feel sure of is that he has gone through hell and would make a good neighbor. Unlike many of the millions who immigrate unofficially, he wants to be a part of the system; he craves legitimacy; he would cherish citizenship. The decision the judge will make, her balancing of sympathy and hardheadedness, will be in microcosm the decision that America and the rest of the developed world must make.

READING NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC
By Catherine A. Lutz and Jane L. Collins.
Illustrated. 309 pp. Chicago:
University of Chicago Press.
Cloth, $59.95. Paper, $19.95. 
 WHEN Arthur Rimbaud in "The Drunken Boat" navigated impassable rivers and was tossed on seas teeming with creatures, when he shuddered in pleasurable horror at totem poles and at giant snakes, conjuring phantoms of cannibals and deep-sea monsters, he had never been abroad. He had never even seen the sea. He was an armchair traveler, an imaginary tourist who had looked at picture books and dreamed. In this as in many other ways, he was a man out of time.
But the lust for strangeness that courses through his poem was shared by the late Victorian era in Europe and in the United States. It was the age of European imperial expansion and the age of a confident, omnivorous appetite for knowledge. In 1888, some 17 years after "The Drunken Boat" was written, Gardiner Greene Hubbard founded the National Geographic Society in Washington and began a bulletin for its members; this periodical would carry readers in ever-growing numbers on adventures to discover the earth's oddities and the wonders beyond home.
National Geographic offered a kind of Wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosities: a heterogeneous archive of natural specimens, both generic and peculiar, a collection summing up the Creation for the pleasure and instruction of its readers. But it also masked, under its high-minded pursuit of scientific knowledge, a thrilling prurience about other people's bodies, a fearful inquisitiveness about tribal rites and customs, a thirst for the primitive and the exotic. The choice of livery for this magazine was no doubt inadvertent, but yellow, one of the colors worn by the Devil and his acolytes in medieval art, carried connotations of the forbidden. Indeed the first issue of National Geographic came out just a few years before Aubrey Beardsley published his erotica in The Yellow Book. The authors of "Reading National Geographic" do not comment on the symbolism of the yellow border, but they do acknowledge that for many young men -- and women -- the magazine was notorious as the first and perhaps only place they were permitted to look at nakedness.
By 1918, the magazine reached 650,000 households; today the circulation stands at over 10 million, and the readership, according to surveys, is four times that number. The journal is a phenomenon of popular culture, like Disneyland and Elvis and Spielberg and Madonna, but unlike them it has been a wallflower at the ball of contemporary cultural studies.
In "Reading National Geographic," Catherine A. Lutz, an anthropologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Jane L. Collins, a sociologist at the University of Wisconsin, have rightly decided to remedy this situation. They ask some shrewd questions about the magazine's character and philosophy; they attempt to assess its interaction with American history in this century and its impact on American attitudes and prejudices. Children of the Vietnam years, the authors are sensitive to the role images play in the making of opinion, and they correspondingly want to analyze National Geographic's photography to see how it articulates a national vision and expresses the United States' sense of its mission in the world.
The book begins with verve, and the reader feels in capable hands. The authors lay out the magazine's enlightened liberalism, with its built-in belief in social evolution, its utopian yearnings and its unabashed wishful thinking: "Only what is of a kindly nature," wrote the editor in 1915, "is printed about any country or people, everything unpleasant or unduly critical being avoided." (In 1978, after a short flirtation with controversy and harsh truths, the board prevailed on the editor to return to the original philosophy and to renounce what they termed "advocacy journalism.") This is still the magazine's policy. One photographer described it like this: "In a story about volcanoes, you should balance the devastation with something good about volcanoes."
This happy-talk, feel-good philosophy can lead to trouble, as it did when National Geographic celebrated Italy under Mussolini and the Marcoses in the Philippines. But on the whole, the authors find few instances of blatantly mistaken propaganda. Instead they trace the ideological messages that they believe saturate the magazine's text and imagery in less perceptible ways, but, in trying to uncover and define these, they begin to flounder. As they strike forward bravely, suddenly the map no longer corresponds to the terrain, the vegetation gets more tangled, and the slough gets ever deeper.
The first acute problem with their analysis arises from their pre-emptive certainty that false consciousness is always at work in some pernicious way and that as the ills of Western supremacy, especially racism, cast a shadow across the rest of the world and its peoples, National Geographic could not help but collude. They test the evidence they find in the magazine against the piles of articles, papers and books written in the last 20 years about issues of otherness; their appetite for this material is vast, but the accumulation self-defeating. With an almost Victorian fervor, they resort to measurements and tables in order to probe objectively. Looking at a sample of 600 National Geographic photographs, they count naked torsos and bare breasts, add up frank stares into the camera's lens and compare them with the number of unfocused gazes, quantify images of dark workers working and white people idling. They even produce a graph comparing representations of people according to skin color -- dark, bronze and light.
Trouble is, they find that National Geographic stands up rather well to the prosecution (or, rather, that their line of questioning fails to deliver much). So they continue to press the accused. They find that even though the magazine has correctly avoided showing "natives" lazing about according to stereotype, it has generally overlooked the history of third-world communities; culture is perceived to begin only when the West arrives. And even though the magazine has surprisingly represented women's work in a positive light, it has also committed various sins: in a photograph of a Burmese woman planting seedlings, the flowers in her hair were touched up so that her femininity should not seem diminished by her labors. Thus the authors argue against one fallacy by finding another.
Scolding and reproof have become new forms of criticism, and their joyless limitations are all too evident here. Ms. Lutz and Ms. Collins concede that the magazine's universal humanism has earnestly avoided degrading the objects of its scrutiny. But this will not do: "National Geographic photography both denies fundamental differences and reifies the cultural boundary that it depicts." One wonders how the authors would feel if the magazine had decided to affirm "fundamental differences" -- as the architects of apartheid did. When the authors say in the epilogue that National Geographic's bland humanism contributed by default to the demonization of the Iraqis and justified the bombings, they seem thoroughly confused.
Many opportunities for a deeper analysis have been missed. For instance, the book describes one photographer's typical shoot in Peru: the children were taken out of school for the day and dressed in picturesque costumes; then the photographer, finding that the daylight had gone, decided not to take the photograph. But here the authors don't give us the economic background (or even the date) of this episode, which might have provided real evidence of the magazine's exploitation. The authors' methods have not served them well. They interviewed a sample of subscribers and nonsubscribers and showed them selected photographs; this yielded stammerings and giggles, of little consequence.
More important, Ms. Lutz and Ms. Collins, in focusing so intently on coverage of humans, only glance at the magazine's corpus of nature stories. This is a shame because the striking change that has taken place in attitudes toward ecology and the relation between beasts and humans might reveal more about how Americans see themselves than the enumeration of breasts and gazes does. Likewise, cartography, one of National Geographic's most powerful departments, earns only passing mention in this book. As Brian Friel dramatized in his play "Translations," naming places on the map is the prerogative of the colonizer.
At a time when travel writing has become established as a powerful, interrogatory literary genre in its own right, when so many artists are exploring race and strife and Orientalisms, a book called "Reading National Geographic" could have introduced this comparative material, even if only to tackle the heart of the real problem about National Geographic: the fact that its deep wish not to offend has often made it dull. Unfortunately for Ms. Lutz and Ms. Collins, the condition has proved contagious. For all their policing, the culprit has not really been brought to book.

HEADLINE: America Unplugged: Entering a Wireless Era -- A special report;
F.C.C. Clearing Airwaves For Phones of the Future

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
America is about to start coming unwired.
A decade after cellular telephones first captured the hearts of the hurried and the well-to-do by letting them stay plugged in without being pinned down, the Federal Government is about to clear the airwaves for an expansion of wireless offerings more sophisticated than anything available today. 
 On Thursday, after four years of work, the Federal Communications Commission will adopt rules that will create three to six new wireless networks in every city and town. Bringing stiff new competition and probably a steep plunge in prices, these services are expected to reach millions of new customers and could eventually replace phones anchored by copper wires.
The first of these new wireless networks could be working in less than two years, and could offer prices half those of cellular. Over the longer term, many industry experts predict, the wireless phones could replace a high percentage of those now tethered to copper wires.
 
More Than a Phone
 That could be a mixed blessing, freeing people from their desks yet chaining them to their jobs. Indeed, cellular companies are already building computerized systems that can automatically track a person's movements anywhere in North America, so the same telephone number will reach a person's desk phone or pocket phone wherever he or she roams. People will run, but they may not be able to hide.
But more than mere phones are on the horizon. Using the digital electronics of computers, the new "personal communications services" will be capable of sending data, images and perhaps even video to an expanding family of nomadic computing devices -- palm-size computers, electronic notepads and what some people call mutant devices that combine the features of a telephone, computer and pager.
To be sure, the risks are also huge: no one knows just what consumers will be willing to pay for; the technology is still very new, and it will cost billions to build the new networks nationwide. But virtually every big communications company is angling for position and lining up capital. The list ranges from media conglomerates like Time Warner Inc. and newspaper publishers like the Washington Post Company to long-distance carriers like A.T.& T. and MCI Communications, all the regional Bell companies and, of course, the current cellular industry.
"We are about to launch a huge industry in the next week," said Scott Schelle, the vice president of American Personal Communications, a small company that is 70 percent owned by the Washington Post Company and has built one of the first experimental personal communications services systems in the United States. "The timing is important because communications, computers and media are converging just as the wireless revolution is coming of age."
Indeed, many industry executives and experts said they believed wireless networks might replace much of the current wired phone network, relegating wall jacks to a place alongside the telegraph key and canal barge as antiquities of communications and commerce.
If the rapid growth of the $8 billion cellular business is any gauge, with 11 million subscribers already using cellular phones and an additional 9,500 signing up each day, the market for new forms of wireless communications could be huge. Tests of personal communications services, or P.C.S., in Washington, Pittsburgh, Tampa, Fla., and other cities, have indicated that tens of millions of people are eager buyers -- if the prices are right and the services ubiquitious.
Arthur D. Little, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., has estimated that personal communications services will generate 60 million customers in the United States by 2005.
Billions of dollars are on the line. For the first time ever, the F.C.C. will grant radio licenses by auctioning them off to the highest bidders, rather than through lotteries or merit-based comparative hearings.
The first auctions could begin as early as next May. The Clinton Administration estimates that these auctions will generate as much as $10.2 billion in revenue for the Federal Government over the next four years, and Wall Street investment bankers are already beginning to plot bidding strategies.
The technology for advanced wireless services has been tested at considerable length, and computer companies are already rushing to market with handheld devices that communicate over cellular frequencies. The limiting factor has always been a shortage of free space on the airwaves, because almost all of the radio frequencies that can be used easily are already occupied. That is why the F.C.C.'s action, which comes after a tortuous effort to reallocate a big chunk of the spectrum, is so central.
At the meeting this week, the commission is to announce its final decision on how many licenses to issue in each market, how much territory each license will cover and how to conduct the auctions.
 
The Incentives
Greater Access And Lower Prices
 The expansion of the wireless services coincides with advances in computers and miniaturization in electronics. Even now, laptop computers and hand-held devices like Apple Computer's Newton Messagepad and A.T.& T.'s EO Personal Communicator are placing enormous power to manage information in the palm of a person's hand. At the same time, the number of electronic mail services and data bases that are accessible from remote locations -- from the Library of Congress to ticket services for sports events -- is growing almost daily.
"There is a convergence of events," says John Major, the director of spectrum standards and software at Motorola Inc., a leading provider of wireless communications equipment. "Before laptops, it didn't matter whether you had an untethered link. Now, people find it annoying to have to plug in their computers."
Perhaps the most immediate impact of personal communications services will be to push down the cost of mobile communications. Today, despite their popularity, cellular services remain forbiddingly high for most customers. A typical local cellular call costs about 40 cents a minute, about double the price of a regular long-distance telephone call between New York and Los Angeles.
 
A Limited Capacity
 The high prices are partly the result of limited competition, because the F.C.C. authorized only two cellular companies to operate in each city. But cellular calls are also expensive because the networks use an aging technology that sharply limits the number of conversations they can carry.
Many experts believe that the new wireless networks will be much more economical. Using newer technology, P.C.S. systems may be able to serve up to 20 times as many customers as a cellular network, meaning that costs can be spread over a much bigger group of customers. Some industry experts, in fact, contend that wireless networks are now actually cheaper to build than those linked by copper.
American Personal Communications is planning to offer service at about 22 cents a minute, or half the price of cellular, and officials say the price will probably decline even further in years to come.
"The economics are indisputable," said Peter Huber, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has studied the telephone industry. "Wireless access is already competitive with wired. If you were starting out from scratch today, you would use radio in preference to copper for much of the country."
 
A Move to Modernization
 Indeed, that is already occurring in some other countries, like the Czech Republic and Hungary, which are building cellular systems as the fastest way to modernize their antiquated phone systems. And in the the small town of Quitague, Tex., the GTE Corporation said several months ago that it would replace part of its aging copper wire network and link many homes over a wireless connection.
Officials at Time Warner, which has teamed up with the regional Bell telephone company U S West Inc. to build what they call "full service networks" that offer wireless services, estimate that the cost to serve a P.C.S. subscriber system could be one-fifth the price of cellular service and even be competitive with conventional telephone service. And unlike most of today's cellular and telephone networks, the new P.C.S. systems will use the digital electronics of computers, offering clearer and more precise signals than older networks, which rely on analog transmissions that mimic sound waves.
"We intend to provide a substitute in the home for the land-line phone," said Dennis Patrick, a former chairman of the F.C.C. and now the president of Time Warner's telecommunications unit. "But because we will be digital from the get-go, we will be able to operate in a multimedia universe. Our technology will be able to handle voice, video and data."
 
The Technology
Computer Clarity From Cell to Cell
 Like today's cellular telephone systems, P.C.S. networks will consist of radio relay stations or "cell sites" -- each typically a few short antennas and a receiver-transmitter -- scattered across many locations in a city. These antennas pick up signals from wireless telephones, and they are linked together by wires or microwave transmissions into a network that can route calls from one place to another.
The networks are connected directly to the local telephone company, which can then link a wireless caller to a person speaking on a conventional plug-in phone. As with cellular systems, the key for personal communications networks is to set up a number of different cell sites that each cover a different part of the city. Using many cell sites makes it possible to use the same frequencies in several places at the same time.
But the P.C.S. systems will be different in several respects. While cellular systems employ a few huge antennas that are almost as big as television towers, the new networks will scatter hundreds of antennas in a large city like New York that are small enough to fit on a window ledge or even on a lamppost.
 
Better Sound Quality
 Because wireless signals will travel much shorter distances, customers can use handheld units that are cheaper and lower powered than cellular phones. The greater number of cell sites will also enable the carriers to re-use the same radio frequencies throughout the city, allowing for more customers.
And because the P.C.S. networks will transmit signals in digital form, the quality of the sound should be better for voice conversations and the transmission of computer data will be much more efficient than with today's analog wireless systems.
Although the cellular companies are slowly converting to digital systems as well, they cannot stop serving customers that use telephones based on older analog technology. In the meantime, however, they are trying to roll out a new technique for sending computer data by mixing it in between the voice-signals of cellular traffic.
 
The Impact
Why No Company Can Go It Alone
 Almost every communications company has something to gain or something to fear with the expansion of wireless and next week's new rules. "This will shake the foundations of the entire telecommunications industry," remarked Alfred C. Sikes, who served as the chairman of the F.C.C. under President George Bush and is now the president of Hearst New Media and Technology, a unit of the Hearst Corporation.
Cellular companies, facing head-to-head competition and fearing that the Government will keep them from bidding on the new licenses, have been actively lobbying on this issue. And local telephone companies, which all own cellular franchises as well, face the prospect of more competition in their core wired business.
But by far the most aggressive companies bidding to enter the new wireless market are cable television companies, most notably Time Warner , Cox Enterprises of Atlanta and the Comcast Corporation of Philadelphia.
Cable television executives are convinced that their networks of coaxial cable, which has much greater capacity than copper telephone wire, are ideally suited to be the backbone of the wireless networks by tying together the radio cell sites scattered around a city. The concept was first tested by Cox in an experimental system it set up in San Diego two years ago.
 
An Idea Catches On
 Since then, the idea has caught on throughout the industry. Time Warner, already in league with U S West and seeking to assemble an even broader consortium to enter the P.C.S. business, has been in active discussions with the largest cable company in the country, Tele-Communications Inc., among other possible partners. Last week another big cable company, Viacom Inc., said it would join a consortium of about 150 companies led by MCI, the second-biggest long-distance carrier in the United States.
Long-distance companies like American Telephone and Telegraph, MCI and Sprint will be affected in two big ways. For starters, all three are convinced they must offer wireless service as part of a comprehensive package of nationwide services. Beyond that, the long-distance carriers see local wireless networks as a way to reach their customers without going through traditional local phone companies and paying them billions of dollars in access charges.
 
Ahead of the Crowd
 A.T.& T. sent seismic waves through the communications industry last month when it announced it was buying the leading cellular company, McCaw Cellular Communications, for $12.6 billion. A.T.& T. can create a powerful new system by endowing McCaw's local cellular networks with the computerized intelligence of A.T.& T.'s long-distance network. Thus armed, A.T.& T. officials arebetting they can beat the crowd of new competitors to the new wireless frontier of P.C.S. services.
While many details of the F.C.C. plan are still being decided, the broad outlines are becoming clear. The most contentious lobbying has been over whether the existing cellular companies should be allowed to bid on the new licenses. Last year, many officials of the agency were worried that the cellular companies would simply snatch up frequencies and stifle new rivals.
Now the agency's officials seem ready to let cellular companies bid on at least some frequencies in their existing markets. But the officials also appear determined to create a seedbed for competition by issuing at least three new licenses -- and possibly six -- in each city.
"It turns out we found we could assign more spectrum than we originally thought" said Thomas N. Stanley, the chief engineer of the F.C.C. "If you have a bigger cake, you can give more people a slice."
 
The Caveats
Uncharted Markets And New Machines
 For consumers there may be a few possible drawbacks to this corporate gold rush. If dependable old local telephone service suffers or becomes more expensive from a market upheaval, a whole host of new wireless services may seem a bad deal. And if consumers thought that choosing a long-distance company in the 1980's was a headache, wait until they contemplate the sales pitches of a half-dozen wireless companies.
But the far bigger risks are for the companies that will have to pay the billions of dollars to bid for the licenses and build the networks.
Technology could also pose problems. Many leading proponents of P.C.S. services are betting on a transmission system called code division multiple access, which makes it possible to pack as many as 20 voice conversations in the bandwidth now needed for just one. Developed primarily by Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego, the technology has won praise throughout the industry. Still, some industry executives and other experts have warned that it has not been fully tested and could prove balky in some settings.
 
New Technical Challenges
 And then there are the new technical challenges of keeping track of millions of messages in which the recipients must be tracked down. With today's wired telephone network, although traffic control is a major consideration, most of the routing is like dispatching freight trucks by tracing the roads that lead to the customers. Wireless communications, where the customers are always on the move, is more comparable to air-traffic control at an airport: there are no stationary routes. The hardware and software for keeping track of all those airborne wireless messages is only now being tested.
Finally, cellular executives and their rivals worry about the inevitable industry shakeout if a slew of new carriers try to do battle. William Weiss, the chairman of Ameritech, a regional Bell telephone company that is active in cellular and hopes to find a role in personal communications services, sees grim times ahead.
"If the F.C.C. persists with the idea of creating three or five new providers in every market," Mr. Weiss grumbled, "there's a substantial question in my mind about whether anybody will make any money at it."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Less Cost vs. Less Care

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
As President Clinton prepares for Wednesday's prime-time presentation of his plan for overhauling health care, his proposed ceiling on medical spending has emerged as one of the plan's most hotly debated aspects, prompting warnings of a degradation in the quality of care or even rationing.
Braking medical spending as sharply as the President proposes -- cutting annual growth by more than half of what it has been in recent years -- could force strapped medical groups to shortchange patients, denying them useful tests and treatments, some doctors and insurance executives maintain. While these critics also fear for their own incomes and profits under the Clinton plan, their warnings are echoed by many economists.
 
Safely Squeezable
 Nonsense, Administration officials say. They and many medical experts portray an American system so replete with inefficiency, duplication, overcharging and overuse of procedures that huge sums can safely be squeezed out for many years to come. 
 Right now, health care consumes 14 percent of the gross national product, up from 10 percent in 1981. Under the Clinton plan spending would be allowed to bulge in the next three years as uninsured Americans were covered, reaching 17 percent of the economy, but it would reach a plateau at that level for years to come.
 
'Bizarre on Its Face'
 Without the Clinton overhaul, Government experts predict, medical spending in the year 2000 would reach 19 percent of the gross national product -- with tens of millions of people still not covered -- and would keep climbing.
"When an American physician tells you that at 17 percent of the G.N.P. we'll have to ration, that seems bizarre on its face," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University and an expert on European health systems that spend far less.
But Dr. Reinhardt added, "The issue is the speed of the slowdown in spending, not the ultimate level." If the transition to a system dominated by lean, efficient health maintenance organizations is too rocky in some regions or does not incorporate proper safeguards for consumers, he said, he could foresee "bad outcomes here and there, rationing in effect."
Even as some critics warn about pressures to scrimp on needed care, others fault the President for avoiding more explicit discussion of medical priorities, of the need to start making hard choices amid an unending flow of costly new technologies that could drain society's resources.
Some advocates of planned rationing, like Daniel Callahan, director of the nonprofit Hastings Center in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., which studies medical ethics, even say the President's plan may be too generous.
"I feel that 17 percent of the economy is absolutely excessive," he said, predicting that it would rob other social needs, like education and investment in jobs, for trivial gains in health.
 
World's Costliest Treatment
 Even many doctors say the nation should find a way to curb hugely expensive intensive care for patients who have only a slight chance of survival. But White House officials, already facing a tortuous political fight over health care, do not want to provoke debate on such divisive questions.
While the medical structure they have proposed is designed to help weed out senseless treatment, these officials insist that talk of overt rationing of care is premature.
Mr. Clinton seeks to halt the rise in medical spending by encouraging stiffer market competition and, if that fails, by imposing mandatory controls that would keep health costs in line with the expansion of the economy.
Even so, under the President's proposals, American medical spending would continue to dwarf that of other industrial nations that have high medical standards.
 
'Huge Cushion of Inefficiency'
 In 1991, the latest year for which international data are available, health spending accounted for more than 13 percent of the American economy but only 10 percent in Canada, 9 percent in France and Germany and 7 percent in Japan and the United Kingdom. Most other nations have controls in place to keep spending from rising much above the 10 percent range, if that.
Paul Starr, a senior White House adviser and an architect of the Clinton plan, said large savings would come through reduced administrative costs and a large-scale shift of consumers into health plans that provide good care for less.
Mr. Starr predicted that competition among medical groups, something already happening in parts of the country, would keep spending in most regions below the proposed caps anyway, but that "it's also important to create certain expectations about spending."
"I don't think that 17 percent of the G.N.P. is all that tight," Mr. Starr said. "We have been through a period of enormous growth in health costs, and I think we have built up a huge cushion of inefficiency."
That view is shared by Dr. David M. Lawrence, chief executive of Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., the nation's largest and oldest H.M.O. and a model for the kinds of medical groups the Clinton plan would encourage.
"Our position is that the way to live under the proposed constraints is through improving the quality of care," said Dr. Lawrence, whose nonprofit company serves 6.6 million patients in 16 states. "You can only do that so long before you finally reach the limits. But I'd suggest that the American health care system isn't even close."
Experts say the best H.M.O.'s are already trimming costs while improving care, by negotiating lower prices for goods and even for organ transplants, by stressing preventive measures and by carefully studying how their doctors make decisions.
 
Aggressively Monitoring Costs
 Compared with standard American medical practice, H.M.O.'s use more primary care doctors, who provide most care and serve as "gatekeepers" to costly specialists. This not only holds down bills but also reduces the level of unneeded surgery and other procedures. As an indication of the potential savings, Dr. Lawrence and other H.M.O. executives point to research like that done by Dr. John E. Wennberg of Dartmouth Medical School, which found huge variations in surgery rates around the country with little impact on patient welfare.
Applying these methods aggressively since 1990, a year in which Kaiser's costs jumped by 15 percent, the H.M.O. kept premium increases to 9.6 percent in 1992 and 6.8 percent in 1993, well below the double-digit growth still experienced by traditional medical plans.
"We're on a very steep learning curve in terms of understanding where all the levers are to keep improving the costs," Dr. Lawrence said. But while H.M.O.'s are poised for rapid gains in efficiency, he said it was "an open question" how quickly the rest of the medical system could reorganize.
David F. Simon, executive vice president of U.S. Healthcare, a for-profit H.M.O. based in Bluebell, Pa., that serves 1.5 million patients in the Northeast, said a broad transition to H.M.O.-type care could reduce total medical spending quickly and dramatically: "We'd estimate in the 15 to 20 percent range, perhaps even more."
 
Too Much, Too Little
 But Mr. Simon said his company was concerned about "an overlay of bureaucratic and regulatory controls" in the health plan that would hamper competition. "I don't think you'll see the kind of savings they are projecting," he said. "If the budget caps kick in, a byproduct could be the need to ration care, or cut back on benefits."
If traditional medicine offers financial incentives to do too much, H.M.O.-type plans have an incentive to minimize treatment, raising fears that patients could be shortchanged.
H.M.O. leaders insist that their companies would suffer losses if they allowed their patients' small problems to grow into big ones. But Dr. Arnold S. Relman, editor emeritus of The New England Journal of Medicine, noted that some groups reward individual doctors directly for ordering fewer tests and referrals, and he warned that a financially troubled for-profit organization could take a short-term view of patient welfare.
 
Wrenching Choices Are Seen
 The White House thinks that publication of data about the performance of each health plan and about the incentives each offers its doctors will help consumers protect themselves; plans that scrimp will lose customers. Dr. Relman would go further by strongly encouraging the development of nonprofit H.M.O.'s run by salaried doctors and their patients rather than investor-owned medical plans.
Economists like Joseph Newhouse of Harvard University argue that given the steady march of useful, expensive medical technologies, any spending limit will necessarily involve sacrifices over time. And they argue that such sacrifices should be openly admitted and discussed.
Many medical ethicists say American society must decide when to withhold expensive care or technologies. Some of the most wrenching examples involve expenditures of hundreds of thousands of dollars in the earliest or latest days of life: saving extremely premature babies who have high chances of severe disabilities even if they survive, or putting patients with advanced cancer, for example, on life-support systems to gain at most a few months more of life.
To some degree, the medical structure offered by the White House may take care of these issues implicitly, Dr. Reinhardt said. "That's the beauty" of a system of medical groups working within fixed budgets, he said. "It hides the rationing, makes it ad hoc, keeps it in the obscurity of the H.M.O. They are not going to say, 'Sorry, we're over budget,' but they might say, 'Gee, it's inhumane to continue treatment.' "
And, provided that the right guidelines and ethical controls were in place and doctors were not being rewarded directly for cheating patients, he said, "It could be a good thing."

The Economy
The Federal Government is about to clear the airwaves for an expansion of wireless communications more sophisticated than anything available today. The Federal Communications Commission will adopt rules on Thursday creating three to six new wireless networks in every city and town. Bringing stiff new competition and probably a steep plunge in prices, these services are expected to reach millions of new customers and could eventually replace phones anchored by copper wires. [Page A1.]
Top Administration economists have stoutly rejected suggestions by Fed officials that the central bank not consider cutting short-term interest rates because of fear that this could fuel an unwanted speculative bubble in stocks and bonds. The economists said near-record stock and bond levels in no way constituted a bubble, but were rather a justified response to lower interest rates and President Clinton's deficit-reduction efforts. [D1.]
 

Companies
Honda plans to make all Accords and Civics for sale in the United States at its plants in Ohio, eliminating exports from Japan of those models. The move is part of a long-range revamping that has been accelerated by the rise of the Japanese yen. [D1.]
Chrysler's experience cleaning up a plant site prompted Michigan to adopt rules that have made the state a national leader in reversing what some say are negative consequences of well-meaning environmental policies. [A12.]
Almost half of the nation's 250 largest law firms cut their number of lawyers this year, according to a survey. [D2.]
 
International
Increased tourism in the Holy Land may turn out to be an important byproduct of the peace accord between Israel and the Palestinians. Tour operators, hoteliers, airlines, cruise lines and governments in the region are racing to roll out the welcome mat to tourists from throughout the world. [D1.]
Amid Palestinian jubilation is a growing sense of how difficult it will be to create a government and an economy from scratch, in a close relationship with a powerful, dominant neighbor. [A8.]
The International Monetary Fund has delayed a $1.5 billion loan to Russia because of Moscow's failure to cut inflation and carry out other promised changes. [A3.]

HEADLINE: Rules Easing for Urban Toxic Cleanups

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich.

 BODY:
In 1990, when the Chrysler Corporation proposed building a $1 billion Jeep plant in Detroit, the site it chose was in a neighborhood of old houses, industrial plants and abandoned lots. But as in much of Detroit, the soil was contaminated with traces of gasoline and some heavy metals, environmental studies found.
The state was adamant that Chrysler clean up the 283 acres to pristine condition before building. But Chrysler officials said the cost of that would have rivaled the value of the new plant. 
 So the state and the automaker compromised on a $25 million project to contain and stabilize the contaminants rather than completely remove them, and the new plant was able to open in January 1992, employing 3,100 people, most of them members of minorities.
Chrysler's experience prompted Michigan to adopt new rules in 1991 intended to make hazardous-waste cleanups less expensive, especially in urban areas where old industrial properties are common. The rules have made Michigan a national leader in reversing what business executives and some conservationists say are three unintended consequences of well-meaning environmental policies.
 
"We Just Have to Get Real'
 First, the costs of complying with rules for toxic cleanups help drive employers away from cities, contributing to economic and social deterioration. Second, the rules are encouraging the development of factories and buildings in uncontaminated forests, fields and meadows. And third, such development beyond the suburbs is causing more urban sprawl and, ultimately, more air and water pollution as workers and their families move or drive to the new job sites.
"What we have is a program that is not working as it was supposed to," said Russell J. Harding, the Deputy Director of the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. "We can't get our old industrial sites redeveloped. We're losing jobs and tax base in the cities. And if the laws aren't adjusted, our green spaces will become gray spaces. It's not what a lot of people want to hear, especially some people in the environmental community, but we just have to get real on this stuff."
Kathy Milberg, the executive director of the Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision Project, a group in the Corktown section of Detroit, is among the environmentalists whose thinking on toxic waste has changed.
"There are a lot of environmental groups, who do their work in the suburbs and the rural areas, who say all land must be cleaned up to pristine standards," she said. "But they don't live here. They aren't losing their kids to economic death. We are literally losing lives because of the unavailability of employment opportunities. There should be allowances made in environmental rules for the city of Detroit to make it easier to reuse property and redevelop."
 
No Cleanup, No Business
 One of Ms. Milberg's friends is Bill Spaulding, who wanted to expand his family's electrical contracting business in Corktown. But Mr. Spaulding'sDetroit bank refused to lend him the money to build an addition where there was an employee parking lot, worrying about the legal liability and whether he would face a regulatory wringer over traces of oil, antifreeze and fuel that had seeped into the ground.
Mr. Spaulding ended up erecting a new building on undeveloped land in Port Huron, 60 miles north of Detroit.
"That was 10 jobs that could have stayed here," Mr. Spaulding said. "Cleanups are expensive and take forever, and those are two of the main reasons banks won't lend money and businesses are not developing in Detroit."
The problem is not confined to Michigan. Studies by the Northeast-Midwest Institute and Resources for the Future, two policy research groups in Washington, found that cities in Indiana, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and other states were experiencing similar problems.
 
Strict Laws Blamed
 Studies in Michigan and Washington said the primary culprits there were the Federal Superfund law, enacted in 1980 to clean up the nation's worst pollution sites, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1984. The first set up a rigidly controlled process for ridding a site of contamination, and the second established expensive requirements for disposing of chemical wastes, principally at incinerators, treatment centers and landfills, many of them built in the last decade in rural regions.
Many states, including Michigan, also enacted their own waste-management laws, in some cases stricter than the Federal statutes, like the Michigan law that stood in the way of the Jeep plant.
All the laws were intended to reduce threats to health and the environment by toxic compounds. But in case after case, say state officials and some scientists here, the levels of contamination found are tiny, and even after millions of dollars are spent on cleanups, particularly in urban areas, it is virtually impossible to measure whether anything improved.
Faced with a program that they were convinced was backfiring, businessmen and city officials called for changes in the state law.
If contamination is slight and in an area, like Detroit, where it is not threatening drinking water or blown in the wind, Michigan law now allows companies essentially to seal in the contaminants with fresh soil or clay.
Michigan also now allows the Attorney General to promise buyers of old industrial properties that the state will not sue them for the cost of cleaning up old contamination. And the state set up a $45 million program to help cities pay for investigating and cleaning up old industrial sites.
Aides to Gov. John Engler, a Republican, say the Department of Natural Resources has been slow to put the more flexible rules into effect, a criticism that Mr. Harding of that department does not dispute. One reason, said Mr. Harding and other state environmental officials, is that many of his staff members do not agree with the approach.
In interviews, state employees who spoke only on the condition that they not to be identified, said they worried that the new rules opened the door to weakening other environmental laws, like cleaning up messes left by underground gasoline and oil tanks that leaked. The employees also said strict hazardous waste rules and companies' potential liability for contamination had been a deterrent that made business executives more careful about managing wastes.
But many city officials in the state say such thinking is hurting their chances to attract new jobs. Monroe, the only Michigan port on Lake Erie, has tried to lure industry to a 400-acre site where sand used in steel casting was once dumped. The sand is slightly tainted by heavy metals, and in some areas, traces of more toxic chemicals, like PCB's, have also been found.
Port executives have commissioned scientific studies that indicate that containing the chemicals where they are would protect public health and the environment. But the state officials are still undecided on how to proceed.
Thomas Russow, the lawyer for the Port of Monroe, said one company interested in buying or leasing property was American Resources Recovery Inc., a Canadian concern that recycles tires. It proposed more than two years ago to build a $12 million plant on 10 acres that would employ 30 people full time and 15 people part time.
But as delays have mounted, company executives have now told Mr. Russow that unless a waiver of liability for past pollution is granted, they are likely to build the plant outside of Monroe in a rural area of the county.

White House Aides Reject a Fed Rate View

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
Top Administration economists have stoutly rejected suggestions by Federal Reserve officials that the central bank not consider cutting short-term interest rates because of fear that this could fuel an unwanted speculative bubble in stocks and bonds.
The economists said near-record stock and bond levels in no way constituted a bubble, but were rather a justified response to lower interest rates, which they said were fostered by lower inflation and President Clinton's deficit-reduction efforts. 
 "We at the Treasury have not been concerned about speculative bubbles," Alicia Munnell, Assistant Treasury Secretary for Economic Policy, said. "It's true stock prices are high, but if you look in the real estate area, commercial values are way down and family homes are down in value. You don't see an economywide speculative bubble."
 
Higher, Not Lower, Rates
 In interviews last week, David W. Mullins Jr., the Fed's vice chairman, and Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor, expressed fears that further rate cuts could cause a surge in investment that would push financial markets to unjustifiable levels, setting the stage for a plunge. But Mr. Mullins said that current stock and bond prices did not appear inflated.
Traders said the central bankers' remarks helped push down the bond market late last week because the comments hinted that the Fed's next move might be to raise, not lower, rates.
J. Bradford De Long, a Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary, said: "I was surprised people would talk about a speculative boom in the bond market. They were saying things I would not expect people to say."
Alan Blinder, a member of the President's Council of Econmic Advisers, also dismissed the idea of a speculative bubble, saying, "Given the gradual nature in the rise of the stock market with the gradual brightening of U.S. economic performance and the lowering of long-term rates, there doesn't seem to be a great disjuncture between stock market values and economic fundamentals."
Mr. Blinder also said the bond market had "risen for very sound fundamental reasons," including the prospects of a lower Federal budget deficit and the "gradually dawning realization that we're living in a low-inflation world."
 
A Tug of War
 In many ways, the argument is a tug of war between conservative Fed officials trying to build a case against lower rates, and perhaps for higher ones, and the Clinton Administration, eager to reduce unemployment, trying to build a case against higher rates. The debate is more than academic because the Fed's main policy-making committee, the Federal Open Market Committee, is to meet Tuesday.
"We seem to be showing steady growth with no signs of inflation," said Ms. Munnell, who used to be chief economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. "It seems we'll be able to continue at this growth rate or somewhat higher for the foreseeable future. That should bring down unemployment, which is our goal, without increasing inflation."
Mr. De Long of the Treasury denied there was a bubble in the bond market. He said the spread between long-term and short-term bond rates had been high for two years but returned to normal levels when long-term rates fell recently.
"I was surprised anyone would think long bonds were overpriced," he said. "And the stock market is where it should be, given the decline in long-term bonds. Remember, money flows out of the bond market into the stock market when interest rates fall."
 
Shadow Group's Influence Seen
 Some economists said Mr. Mullins and Mr. Lindsey were influenced by the Shadow Open Market Committee, an independent group of highly conservative economists who say the amount of currency and bank reserves is growing so fast that the prices of stocks and other assets have been artificially inflated.
But the central bankers might have made their comments, several economists said, to deflect criticisms from these conservative monetarists as well as from liberals. With inflation falling and growth remaining lackluster in recent months, more and more liberal economists have urged the Fed to cut interest rates.

HEADLINE: Arabs Say Prompt Aid Is Crucial for Self-Rule

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JABALIYA, Israeli-Occupied Gaza Strip, Sept. 17

 BODY:
In a sight that seemed unthinkable only a month ago, once-forbidden Palestinian flags are flying these days from nearly every building in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as well as from cars, bicycles, donkey carts, tractors and even the minarets of mosques in East Jerusalem.
But while Palestinians in the occupied territories have greeted the Israeli-P.L.O. peace accord with jubilation, there is a growing sense of the difficulty in creating some form of government and an economy virtually from scratch, in a complex relationship with a powerful, dominant neighbor. 
 "It is good to raise the flags," said the imam of the main mosque in a sermon on Friday at this litter-strewn Palestinian camp, where a strong undercurrent of opposition to the accord among Islamic fundamentalists is evident on the streets. "But after raising flags, what is the next step? The solution is not just raising flags."
So swift has been the rush toward peace, and so deliberately vague many of the terms of the accord, that no one seems sure how the economy or the new Palestinian governing authority in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho will function. What's more, it will be years down the road before there is any discussion of the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees from Israel's founding in 1948.
 
Crucial, Immediate Steps
 "They must do something fast," said Ziad Abu Amr, a Palestinian political scientist at Bir Zeit University on the West Bank. "Both Arafat and Rabin need to show their respective constituencies there are gains."
Among the crucial first steps are economic efforts to create steady jobs and business opportunities and to improve living conditions at the squalid camps. Some Palestinian analysts, like Rashid Khalidi, director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Chicago, warn that failure to do so quickly could be a "catastrophe" for Palestinian self-rule.
"You are taking a shattered Palestinian economy and binding it quite tightly to a robust, rapidly growing Israeli economy," Dr. Khalidi said."It's not going to lead to the kind of economic takeoff that's necessary."
With the immediate needs of the occupied territories estimated at $3 billion by the World Bank, supporters of the accord on interim Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho are scrambling to put together an aid package for schools and basic services like electricity and sewage removal.
Israeli and Palestinian technical teams are to meet in Tunis on Monday to discuss issues ranging from security to sewage, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher is expected to announce a special conference of donor countries to pledge money for projects to further Middle East Peace.
Officials of the Palestine Liberation Organization are hoping for a big infusion of aid to build schools and houses here in the next few months. Such a program could create construction jobs in the territories, which have an unemployment rate of 60 percent and have provided Israel with a pool of cheap labor.
Aside from the economic doubts, there is considerable uncertainty about how a new political order will meld Yasir Arafat, chairman of the P.L.O., and other of its officials from Tunis with prominent local Palestinians who played an important role in the six-year uprising against Israeli rule, like Faisal al-Husseini and Sari Nusseibeh.
P.L.O. officials will also face the challenge of coordinating with new political organizations that emerged during the uprising and with traditional village and clan structures in a political culture that has been shaped by a quarter-century of occupation.
 
'Not a Love of Authority'
 "You don't have a tradition of government here," said Dr. Khalidi, an American-born adviser to the Palestinian delegation to the peace talks. "There is not a tradition of large bureaucratic institutions, not a love of authority. The social structure is not terribly developed."
He continued: "There will be a fine line between the authority of the elected government and the authority of the P.L.O. There will have to be all kinds of deliberate balances. Any corruption, any inefficiency, any bureaucratic snafu, any mistakes, and people are not going to be forgiving."
One immediate source of tension between Palestinians has eased with an agreement between the P.L.O. and its main hard-line fundamentalist opponent, Hamas, to respect each other's demonstrations and not to attack each other. The pact between the two movements was announced last week in mosques throughout the Gaza Strip.
Hamas firmly opposes the accord with Israel. For the signing of the pact last Monday, the two Palestinian groups hastily worked out a truce in which the Gaza Strip was shut down in a protest strike in the morning and open for celebrations in the evening.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Continued Volatility Seen in Bonds

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market is perverse in many ways. It thrives on bad news, like a sluggish economy and declines in jobs. It even turns reassuring cliches upside down. For example: No news is bad news in the bond market for the next several weeks.
With prices and yields apparently locked in a trading range after the sell-off last Tuesday caused by a higher-than-expected jump in inflation in August, new economic data are needed to provide a sense of direction for the market. 
 But no high-impact data are due until the Labor Department releases the September jobs report on Oct. 8. That will be followed by retail sales and the Producer Price Index on Oct. 14 and the Consumer Price Index on Oct. 15. Only after those reports will traders and investors have the kinds of economic signposts they want. And only if these data are reassuringly sluggish on growth and low on inflation will long-term yields be able to tilt downward again.
 
Looking for Signs
 So, between now and then the market ought to continue to be volatile, reacting to minor economic reports like the housing starts and durable- goods data due this week, and bouncing up and down wildly during the day, as it did last week.
While they await the big-league data, the economists will be sifting through smaller bits of information to see if there are any signs that the economy, which grew at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the first half of the year, is building up some steam. And as they do, they will debate whether there is enough growth to worry the bond market by raising new concerns about inflation.
Richard Berner, the chief economist at the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said he had seen several indications of growth recently. These included the signs of an upturn in consumer spending, as reflected in anecdotes from car dealers, data on sales at department stores and the small rise in retail sales last month. "It is not a spectacular boom, just steady gains," he said.
A decline in weekly claims for jobless benefits and the rise in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's manufacturing index seemed to point to a better job performance for September, with nonfarm employment likely to rise to the 150,000 range, a contrast to the surprising decline of 39,000 last month.
 
Demand for Business Equipment
 There is also the small gain in industrial production for August, including signs of good demand domestically for business equipment.
These signals point to growth that will show up in the fourth quarter of the year rather than the third quarter, Mr. Berner said. Unexpectedly slow auto production, which is holding back growth in the current three-month period, is expected to bounce up with the new model year, giving a lift to the last three months of the year.
He translated this into an economy growing at an annual rate of 2 percent, after adjustment for inflation, from July through September, and a 3.5 percent pace from October through December.
While this is nothing spectacular, it is possible that indications of such a pickup toward the end of the year could worry traders and investors. With long-term yields already at 25-year lows and securities very expensive, buyers may lose their nerve even if data showed the economy was just a notch above sluggish.
 
Prices Held Back
 But Mr. Berner said he did not agree. He said he expected inflation to remain around its current 2.9 percent rate, and added that there were plenty of forces holding prices back, including oil prices, cuts in air fares and the slowing of the pace of health care price increases.
"It may have a little bit farther to go," he said of the decline in long-term interest rates.
But he said the stronger growth at the end of the year could have an impact on shorter-term interest rates, which are likely to be the focus of a lot of speculation this week as the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets to set the central bank's policy on interest rates for the next several months.
Stronger economic growth data in the near future would be sure to confirm the expectation that the Federal Reserve will not lower its short-term interest rate target of 3 percent, which has been unchanged for a year. That puts an upward bias on short-term rates.
 
Gauging the Fed's Intentions
 Analysts said they did not think the Fed committee, which will meet tomorrow, will make any change in its 3 percent target, especially because the data for retail sales and industrial production for August were a little stronger than expected.
What analysts are looking for is a more subtle sign of the Fed's intentions: whether the Fed will change from a bias in its policy-making mechanism toward higher short-term interest rates or move back to a neutral stance. The move to a bias toward higher rates was made in the May meeting, when consumer prices were rising at an annual rate of 4 percent. The bias was not changed in July, and analysts said they expected that it was not changed in the August meeting, the minutes of which will be released on Friday.
Darwin L. Beck, the director of the economics department at the First Boston Corporation, and David Jones, the chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, said they thought the Fed would hold its ground. "The Fed is much more worried about the possibility of accelerating inflation than declining growth," Mr. Jones said. Mr. Beck added, "There is nothing forcing them to change."
If there is no change in this indicator of central bank intentions, a little more upward pressure might be added to the short-term interest rates. But, at the same time, the refusal to change might re-emphasize the central bank's anti-inflation credentials, which would help longer-term interest rates inch lower.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Delays $1.5 Billion Loan to Russia Because Reform Is Stalled

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund has decided to delay a $1.5 billion loan to Russia because of Moscow's failure to cut its inflation rate and carry out other promised reforms.
But United States and fund officials said they were encouraged that the Russian Government has shown what they see as a stepped-up commitment to reform during the last few days, for instance in the appointment of former Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar as a First Deputy Prime Minister. 
 In recent weeks, the International Monetary Fund and the Clinton Administration have told Russia that they were concerned that inflation had ballooned to 29 percent monthly in August and that Moscow was not doing enough to reduce its budget deficit.
 
$44 Billion Aid Plan Approved
 But after visiting Moscow on Tuesday and Wednesday, Lawrence H. Summers, Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs, said he was more encouraged about the Russian situation than he had been in mid-summer.
"The recent inflation rate has been too high, but I am encouraged by Russia's official plans to get financial conditions back under control," he said today. "It is crucial that these plans be implemented as a basis for economic growth in Russia and for the full effectiveness of Western support."
The United States and other leading industrial nations have approved a $44 billion aid package for Russia, including a stretching out of $16 billion in debt repayments. Much of that aid is not expected to be affected by Russia's failure to carry out certain reforms.
But the more than $10 billion that would come from the I.M.F. and World Bank or be funneled through them could be delayed for months if Russia fails to bring inflation and the budget deficit under control.
A senior fund official told reporters this weekend that his organization was unhappy with Russia's backtracking on reforms during the summer. He said: "Important measures in the budget field have not been taken, and credit discipline has been relaxed. This has put their reform program off track."
The I.M.F. appears to be dangling the delayed $1.5 billion loan as a carrot to push Moscow to gets its economic house in order. The senior fund official, who insisted on anonymity, said the loan was being delayed indefinitely, but he hinted that Moscow might receive the loan by the end of the year if it displayed a strong and renewed commitment to reform.
An American official said, "Our message is, if Russia's policies continue to get out of control and inflation continues to go up, it will be difficult for the multilateral aid package to continue."
 
Yeltsin in Battle
 The Government of President Boris N. Yeltsin has been forced into a gridlock by a battle between those who want to push ahead with painful market-oriented measures, including sharp cuts in credits to floundering enterprises, and others who favor more state regulation and planning and doling out more credits to keep enterprises afloat. American and I.M.F. officials are optimistic that the appointment of Mr. Gaidar will help tilt the balance in favor of the first bloc.
A senior Administration said, "We're very encouraged by Gaidar's return and by indications from the Russian Government that they now see the need for a rapid turn toward stabilization and reform."
Last spring, the I.M.F. established a new loan program to help former Soviet bloc countries make the wrenching transition toward a market economy. The fund committed itself to lending Russia $3 billion. Russia received half in June, and was scheduled to receive the second half this month.
The World Bank has also delayed a planned $600 million loan to Russia.
 
Progress Is Seen
 Despite these delays, Administration officials said Russia's economy was not in desperate shape and had made considerable progress over the last year.
"The Russian economy looks good relative to what observers might have expected in the September of 1990, 1991 or even September of 1992, despite the 29 percent inflation in August," a senior Treasury Department official said. "Output has stopped contracting. Coal prices have been increased. The exchange rate has stabilized. And dollar incomes are up substantially."
Another encouraging sign is that after the burst in inflation in August, Russian inflation simmered down during the first two weeks in September to just 3 percent a week.
The sense among American officials is that after weeks of dismay during the summer, when Russian reformers seemed to be losing ground, an important turn for the better is in the offing.
The senior I.M.F. official said the Fund would do everything it could to assist Russia to help prevent the scheduled loans from being seriously disrupted. But he said it was important to remember the immense political and economic difficulties that Russia's reformers face.

HEADLINE: In Mideast, Tourism Heats Up

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
Luz A. Beltran, a Roman Catholic from Indianapolis, has made pilgrimages to shrines at Fatima, Portugal; Lourdes, France, and Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City, but her fondest wish has long been to visit the Holy Land.
"I was afraid to go, though," she said, "because there always seemed to be trouble in the Middle East."
But about a week ago, as a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians seemed imminent, Mrs. Beltran set aside plans to visit Greece and signed up for an eight-day tour next month of religious sites in Israel.
 
Rolling Out the Welcome Mat
 Tour operators, hoteliers, airlines, cruise lines and governments in the region are racing to roll out the welcome mat, certain that millions of tourists from throughout the world will feel the same way. 
 With stunning speed, a region that was widely thought of in terms of terrorism, air raids and besieged people in gas masks is being transformed into a land of milk and money, boasting not only archeological digs and ancient civilizations, but also beckoning beaches, luxury hotels, desert safaris and an unsurpassed blend of tradition and modernity.
Governments that had been mortal enemies are signing agreements to promote tourism in one another's backyards, and the transformation seems to be taking place less because of marketing and advertising hype than the realization that what until recently seemed forever forbidding is now possible and potentially risk free.
"I still can't believe it," Mrs. Beltran said on Friday about her forthcoming visit. "I thought I would never get to go to the Holy Land."
 
A Gradual Reassessment
 The public's reassessment has come gradually, as a tide of terrorist acts that horrified the world has ebbed in recent months. Two years ago, an Australian tourist was shot and killed at point-blank range in East Jerusalem and, in 1990, a Canadian tourist was killed by a pipe-bomb explosion on a Tel Aviv beach.
Religious militants also crippled Egypt's tourist industry by their attacks on tour buses and cruise ships, killing three tourists last year and wounding dozens of others.
But while many people, Americans and foreigners, caution that a recurrence of terrorist acts could undo all that has been accomplished by diplomacy, it has not escaped them that the Middle East may now actually compare favorably in the minds of the safety-conscious with American destinations like Florida, where nine tourists have been killed within a year in headline-grabbing murders, many of them committed during bump-and-rob incidents.
In any case, in the Middle East, except for Egypt, tourists have only rarely been the specific targets of terrorist acts.
Executives of travel-related companies as well as government officials who would like to see the region's desert-like service economies bloom caution against raising hopes too high too fast. But for now those warnings are being lost amid widespread euphoria, as various Middle Eastern governments sense a fundamental shift in attitudes about the region and brace for a flood of new business.
"The reaction has been absolutely phenomenal," said Jim Adair, president of Regina Tours in Chardon, Ohio, which specializes in Holy Land tours for Catholics. "We usually average 100 tourists in November, but this year it'll be in excess of 600. Our phones haven't stopped ringing."
Other tour operators and travel agents report a similar surge in demand.
"I've been involved in travel to the Holy Land for over 30 years, and this is the biggest event connected with tourism in my lifetime," said James Ridgway, president of Educational Travel Services in Lakeland, Fla., "Tourism to the region is going to explode and prosper."
 
Israel Expected to Benefit
 Israel, which already plays host to 1.75 million visitors a year, one quarter of whom are Americans, is expected to benefit the most initially. Government authorities expect a 25 percent increase in visitors in the next year. But "the sky's the limit," said Uzi Michaeli, Israeli tourism commissioner for North America.
"The first thing that will move into the region will be tourists, then economic development, then you'll have a Middle East common market," he said.
In anticipation, El Al, Israel's national airline, recently decided to keep two Boeing 747's it had planned to unload after delivery of two new 747-400's next spring, and it plans to train additional airline pilots.
Arkia, Israel's second-biggest carrier, is determined not to be left behind. According to trade press reports, it is considering starting flights to Amman, Jordan; Beirut, Lebanon; Damascus, Syria, and Cairo.
 
Hilton Building in Region
 There could be other winners, too. Hilton International is placing big bets in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where it is building hotel and resort properties, in addition to the new deluxe hotel it is erecting in Jerusalem across from the walls of the Old City.
Hoping for a piece of the action, Emirates, the airline of the United Arab Emirates, recently opened sales offices in New York, Washington, Houston and Los Angeles in an effort to woo American visitors.
"We're also forging marketing agreements with American carriers to fly passengers to European gateways," said James Baxter, Emirates' vice president for North America.From there, Emirates, which does not fly to the United States, would carry passengers to the Arab Gulf states.
To handle the expected influx, Marriott is expected to open a 224-room hotel in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates next Month, complete with a sports bar, an English pub, health club and spa. Like many Middle Eastern countries, Dubai already receives many business travelers from Europe and weekend tourists from countries in the region. But the arrival of Western amenities is absolutely vital if the area is going to attract visitors from farther away, in the view of Ed Fuller, the managing director of Marriott international properties.
 
Infrastructure Needed
 "Until there is more infrastructure, the whole region won't have as many tourists as Paris," he predicted.
Government officials are more confident that if they build the rooms, the curious will come.
"Tourism is still a nascent industry, but it's growing and there is great potential for growth," said Dr. Edmond Ghareeb, press attache of the United Arab Emirates Embassy in Washington. "This country can easily absorb hundreds of thousands of new tourists, and with people no longer feeling fearful, we and the rest of the region will benefit."
Other countries may have a tougher time attracting tourists' dollars. Yemen, for example, a poor country on the southern border of Saudi Arabia, recently opened its ports to small cruise ships. And a few months ago, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, a country off-limits to Americans, proposed that Libya encourage mass tourism. Yet, neither country has been able to make much headway with American visitors who are being constantly reminded by the State Department of the potential dangers.
 
A Switch in Attitudes
 Perhaps most remarkable is the way that once standoffish neighbors are suddenly cozying up. Israel and Greece, for example, recently signed an agreement to stimulate travel between the two countries. And several weeks ago, Israel, Egypt, Greece, Turkey and Cyprus agreed to cooperate in promoting tourism and invited Lebanon, Jordan, Syria and Morocco to join them, according to Mr. Michaeli.
Andy Duncan, a London-based director with PKF Consulting, said that while many Middle Eastern countries were actively courting visitors, Western tourists should nevertheless keep in mind that there will always be holdouts in every country who harbor lingering hostility toward their former enemies.
"I was in the Gulf recently," he said, "and I wasn't allowed to enter any Arab country because I had an Israeli visa in my passport. Hopefully, that's going to change."

Chart: "Warnings"
 Travel to most Mideast countries has been discouraged by the State Department. Here are excerpts from the most recent advisories, issued by the State Department in August.
 
ISRAEL
 "Israel has strict security measures that may affect visitors . . . Violent incidents such as stabbings have occurred in Easts Jerusalem; the area is especially dangerous for tourists . . . "
 
IRAN
 "The Department of State warns all United States citizens against travel to Iran . . . U.S. citizens traveling to Iran have been detained without charge, arrested and harassed by Iranian authorities."
 
IRAQ
 " . . . warns all U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq. Conditions within the country remain unsettled and dangerous."
 
EGYPT
 "Incidents do not appear to be directed at tourist targets."
 
LEBANON
 ". . . so dangerous that no U.S. citizen can be considered safe from terrorist acts."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Selling a Health Proposal: Catchwords and Humility

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's toughest problem in selling a health care overhaul to the American people will be boiling down into a single evocative slogan a highly complex plan that will have very different impacts on businesses, individuals and families.
White House officials said today that if they had to distill their message to a bumper sticker, it would be one word in capital letters: SECURITY. The point, they argue, is that the Clinton plan, above all else, offers people the security of knowing that if they change jobs, if they lose their jobs, if they suffer a catastrophic illness, if hospital costs skyrocket, they will always have the security of their health care. 
 "First and foremost will be the theme of 'security,' " said a Presidential adviser, George Stephanopoulos. "That is the emotional core of this plan. It speaks to people's deepest fears. The idea is that no matter what happens to you -- if you lose your job, if your wife loses her job, if you switch jobs, or if your company goes under -- your health care will be nationally guaranteed."
Having learned from its botched, and nearly fatal, effort to sell its economic plan to Congress this summer, White House officials say they are approaching health care with a very different strategy. The hubris that the President knows best will be replaced with a demeanor of humility in which Mr. Clinton will invite others to contribute their own ideas. Instead of letting its opponents frame the issues, the Administration, even before the President delivers the plan to Congress, is already combating their claims with advertisements and public appearances.
 
Teaching as Well as Selling
 And the initially partisan approach to the President's economic plan is being eschewed for an avowedly bipartisan, come-one-come-all strategy for winning passage on Capitol Hill.
At its broadest level, Administration officials say, their health care strategy will aim at doing two things at once: educating the public about the issues, while trying to sell the Clinton solution over all others.
"This is an issue that is a kitchen table issue," said Mandy Grunwald, an Administration political strategist. "People really care about it. As a result, the amount of information that people want is far more than on any other policy issue, like the deficit. That is why the biggest task will be public education on simply what is in the plan."
A unique aspect of health care education, Ms. Grunwald said, is that the wealthier a person is, the less he or she tends to know about the vagaries of health care. Focus groups run by the Administration consistently reveal that it is the working classes and unemployed who have the most awareness of the limits, pitfalls and intricacies of the current health care system.
 
Already Battling on Television
 "It gives us a more difficult selling job with elites, but a wonderful basis of communication with the general public," Ms. Grunwald said.
For a skeptical middle class, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, which includes many people who fear that the Clinton plan means less health care for more money, rather than more health care for less money, the message will be: "You are going to still have a choice. You are going to get a plan at least like the plan you have now, or better, and for most people it will cost less."
Both that middle-class message and the aggressiveness of the Administration in trying to shape the debate were apparent on Saturday, when the Democratic National Committee began running an advertisement in response to one begun last week by the Health Insurance Industry of America. That ad, picturing a couple at the kitchen table criticizing the President's proposals, argued that the plan would limit consumers' choice of doctors and other health care providers.
The Democratic Party commercial says: "The insurance companies may not like it -- but the President didn't design it for them -- he designed it for you." It goes on to say that "after years of denying people coverage and jacking up prices," the insurance industry is now scrambling to protect the status quo.
 
Batter Up: Hillary Clinton
 The sales campaign begins in earnest immediately after the President unveils his plan on Wednesday before a joint session of Congress. Mr. Clinton, his wife, Hillary, Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, most of the Cabinet, many members of the President's health care task force and a host of industry experts supporting the Administration will hit the road with everything from town hall meetings to bus trips to sell the plan while educating people about its contents.
Mrs. Clinton, in particular, will be featured by the Administration, because it is felt that she has very high credibility in general and because women tend to make most of the health care decisions for their families.
The other day James Carville, a Clinton strategist, was speaking to a convention in San Francisco when a questioner rose and asked him whether the Administration's health care numbers were really credible. He answered that he had asked Mrs. Clinton the exact same question last week, and she assured him that they were.
"And when Mrs. Clinton tells me its Easter, I start dying eggs," Mr. Carville said.
 
Plain Folks, Not Experts
 With the Clintons and Gores, the Administration strategy is to frame their public appearances in settings where they can both educate and sell, but always using "real people," not experts, to make their point.
"People are hungry for change, but scared when they get right up to it," said Kevin Anderson, spokesman for the Administration's health care operation. "It is like when your child begs you to take him swimming, but when he gets right up to the pool's edge he freezes. So part of the strategy is just patience. What we are about here is having a long conversation with the American people that will go on for many months as this works through Congress."
With Congress, the strategy is to build on the bipartisan base for health care reform that is already there.
While there are still myriad differences between the Administration's health care plan and the Republican version offered Wednesday by Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, the two agree on the bedrock points, said Ms. Grunwald: that the final destination should be universal coverage with a comprehensive benefits plan, and that in the debate over who should pay -- a single government payer or the private sector -- the answer has to be some kind of mix.
 
'Not All or Nothing'
 Mr. Stephanopoulos said: "The President is going to approach the debate with humility. His demeanor will be: 'I have a plan. I think it is a good plan. I think it meets the basic needs. But I want everyone involved. It is not all or nothing. I will take good ideas, as long as my basic principles are met.' "
These are the basic principles that the President, his wife and the Administration have begun to enunciate and will hammer home in the next year:
*Security -- that the plan has to make both the uninsured and the insured feel more secure, not less.
*Simplicity -- that the plan has to produce a simpler health care system that people can understand and use, not added complexity (even though that is exactly what skeptics have noted about the President's plan).
*Choice -- that consumers be given a choice each year of different plans.
*Savings -- that any plan must slow the rate of growth in health care costs, now $900 billion a year.
*Quality -- that if the public does not believe the plan will result in better quality care it will never pass.
*Responsibility -- that patients, hospitals, doctors, insurers, small businesses and large, will each have to contribute a fair share.
"Within those broad principles I think you will find the President being very flexible," said Ms. Grunwald. "The only line in the sand is that when this is over every American should have a health care security card and comprehensive benefits."

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Lesson in Politics: Role of Credibility

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
"THERE are two things that are important in politics," Senator Mark A. Hanna of Ohio once said. "The first is money, and I can't remember what the second one is."
Nor, perhaps, could New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman when, to pay for a frantic television attack on an opponent a year ago, her campaign borrowed $450,000 from a bank whose sister securities company was aggressively lobbying to get more business from the Comptroller's office. 
 "Gross negligence" was how the city's Department of Investigation characterized Ms. Holtzman's "failure to inquire whether Fleet Bank or companies related to it were doing or seeking business with her office."
The investigation evokes twin tenets of government: personality can affect a public figure's performance, and a cover-up can be even more damaging than an original indiscretion (although voters only find out about cover-ups that failed).
Ms. Holtzman has gamely assembled a lawyerly defense that might well wash in court. Technically, including fees and annualizing the interest rate, the loan was not preferential and therefore was not subject to the city's conflict-of-interest rules.
Skeptical investigators found no hard evidence that she had been told specifically that Fleet was seeking to become a co-manager of borrowings. Straining credulity, though, Ms. Holtzman said she had not read a news article that mentioned Fleet's application and also quoted her goal of involving more companies owned by minority groups and women. "Reading what I have already said," she testified, "is not particularly interesting to me."
Nor have investigators proved that she personally directed her staff to choose Fleet Securities as one of 23 co-managers. In addition, there were valid reasons for including Fleet: it had a good record for selling city bonds and participated in comptroller's office loan programs for small business and affordable housing.
But the allegations, and how Ms. Holtzman has handled them, probably cost her last Tuesday's Democratic primary. And the unresolved charges may all but end her promising political career as she faces a runoff against Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi a week from tomorrow in the comptroller race.
That Ms. Holtzman has often been regarded as rigid and self-righteous made some critics all the more eager to gloat once her moral compass appeared to have wavered momentarily and then was recalibrated by self-justification and an unshakeable faith in her own innocence.
She never got along by going along. In Congress, she was one of only 10 members who voted against reinstating Robert E. Lee's United States citizenship. For years, she refused to concede to Alfonse M. D'Amato, the Republican who defeated her in the 1980 Senate race.
Arguably, her personality has cut two ways. She single-mindedly pursued objectives regardless of personal cost. Some of her goals may have been harder to realize because the collegiality that government often demands has not been her strongest suit. (Still, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal mayoral candidate and former Federal prosecutor in Manhattan, praises Ms. Holtzman's cooperation in joint investigations when she was Brooklyn District Attorney.)
But right makes might, as in maybe. And while nice guys or gals don't always finish last, being not nice is no guarantee of finishing first. Two women who worked for Fleet -- an officer who was asked to approve the loan to Ms. Holtzman and another who was solicited for a campaign contribution -- balked because they opposed her politically.
Ms. Holtzman did not seem very nice in the Senate primary last year when she vigorously pursued legitimate questions, coupled with innuendo, about the business relationships of Geraldine A. Ferraro and her husband in Little Italy in Manhattan, where the family owns and manages property. The questions cost both candidates the nomination. But full and frank responses by Ms. Ferraro might have spared her; indignance and denial did not work.
For Ms. Holtzman, too, the Fleet case could have been a cathartic. She could have said something like: "I desperately needed money because our system of campaign financing stinks; banks have always given politicians preferential treatment; I should have checked whether Fleet was seeking city business; I made a mistake; I'm sorry; but the bottom line is there is no evidence that I had any role in the selection of Fleet as a co-manager or that the officials in my office who chose Fleet knew that the bank had loaned me money or contributed to my campaign." She may have said this in bits and pieces but never seemed to completely come clean.
In "The Moral Sense" (Free Press), James Q. Wilson writes: "For people to be impressed by your honesty, you must either be honest all of the time (in which case you will have to stop taking advantage of the many opportunites for cheating, and so you might as well stop being greedy altogether), or you will have to be honest in some very conspicuous, highly dramatic fashion, such as telling the truth even when it costs a lot of money to do so."
Preaching is easier than practicing. "The best answer to a smear," Richard M. Nixon said in his Checkers speech, "is to tell the truth."
Truth is elusive. Credibility is even harder to come by. But it may constitute that second important aspect of politics, which Mark Hanna couldn't remember and Ms. Holtzman may have forgot.

HEADLINE: Survey Finds Retrenching In Law Firms

 BODY:
Almost half of the nation's 250 largest law firms cut their number of lawyers this year, according to a survey published today in The National Law Journal.
The firms that shrank from 1992 lost an average of three lawyers, the weekly trade magazine reported. 
 The decline in lawyers was greater in the Southwest and West than in the Northeast and Southeast, said Doreen Weisenhaus, the journal's editor in chief.
"It seems to mirror a lot of what happened in the economy this year," she said.
Ms. Weisenhaus said the firms that had grown had generally concentrated on the practices they knew best. Among the areas of specialty showing the greatest gains were regulatory practices based in Washington and corporate and financial practices based in New York.
 
Top Three Keep Rankings
 The three largest firms kept their rankings in 1993: Baker & McKenzie of Chicago (with 1,662 lawyers, up 58 from last year); Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue of Cleveland (1,066, down 117), and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom of New York (1,021, up 45).
Moving from 10th place to a tie for 4th was Weil, Gotshal & Manges of New York, which the magazine called "the real success story among the top 10 firms." Weil, Gotshal has one of the largest bankruptcy practices, a category that has recently flourished.
The going rate for starting salaries at leading firms in New York was $83,000, for the fourth straight year. New law graduates hired by the top firms received $60,000 in Atlanta and $70,000 in Los Angeles and Chicago.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
How an Opera, Guaranteed to Fail, Can Be Seen as a Moral Triumph

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
The New York City Opera's production of Michael Tippett's "Midsummer Marriage" was not a success, but its very existence is a moral triumph of sorts. In the midst of a 50th-anniversary season more apprehensive than celebratory, Christopher Keene, the company's general director, has made room for the new, the neglected, the unusual and the troublesome. Mr. Keene has only occasionally had the resources, concrete and human, to do these operas well. He also knows they are bad for business.
So in one way or another, the failure of "The Midsummer Marriage" was built in from the start: either failure in terms of operatic quality or failure in terms of audience response, and in this case both. Admirable goals and self-defeat have been frequent partners during the City Opera's history. To use the old expression, the company can't win for losing, and to reverse the thought, losses like this one can be made to seem like victories. 
 If many of its successes have been ambiguous, one is clearly not and that is the house's ability to nurture young American singers and send the truly gifted among them off to larger international careers. One of its major problems is straightforward too: the New York State Theater, which is unsuited for opera and even less so for most of the American musicals the house puts on. The public space is too big to permit intimacy. Stage, wings and backstage are too small, stifling opera's need to breathe with appropriate grandeur.
High in this company's unwritten charter is the obligation to provide modest productions of old favorites. Five of this season's 14 operas are by Puccini; "Carmen," "The Mikado," "The Student Prince" and "Le Nozze di Figaro" surround them. Professional singers gain experience. Newcomers to opera receive the proper introductions. Aficionados on low budgets look and listen affordably. Yet barely 100 yards away are the same operas sumptuously produced by the Metropolitan Opera. Comparisons that ought not to be made inevitably are. As a result, intentionally modest productions are criticized for not being more than they were meant to be.
Daily grind, underrehearsed second casts and routine repertory produce sleepy performances, and they in turn can send potential converts to opera fleeing from the hall. But Mr. Keene has wisely addressed the "old chestnut" syndrome by re-outfitting popular favorites with brighter productions. In the case of the original-version "Madama Butterfly," in which Puccini's ugly Americans are restored to their original nastiness, the company has created something fascinating out of something shopworn.
A less solvable problem at the City Opera is the intransigent mediocrity of its orchestra, which can be induced by the right conductor to play familiar music fairly well, but which, when faced with Mr. Tippett's uneven metric movement, is either unable to play together or does not care to. The house's administration has quietly addressed this anomaly for years but is largely frustrated by a militant musicians' union that fights dismissals fiercely. Thus the No. 2 opera company in what may be the cultural capital of the world is automatically diminished no matter how good the singer or how effective the production.
Most Broadway shows are lost in this cave of a theater. Players onstage are remote, and the antidote, swollen electronic amplification, turns solutions into new problems.
Now look at the rest of this season: the brave world of Hugo Weisgall's "Esther," "Marilyn," by Ezra Laderman, and Lukas Foss's "Griffelkin," all world premieres of American works. There have been Busoni's "Doktor Faustus" and Schoenberg's "Moses und Aron" in the recent past and this year "The Midsummer Marriage," a piece not many of us have seen before.
"The Midsummer Marriage" is not an important opera, but it is sometimes a beautiful one. Its marriage of orchestral movement to stage movement and its delicate, economical instrumental sound date from an earlier phase in Mr. Tippett's career and remain blessedly distant from his heroic if clumsy struggles with huge musical forces and cosmic moral schemes.
"The Midsummer Marriage" is an opera of ideas -- or better, of spiritual impulses. Not much happens. So its Manichaean debate between light and dark can hold our attention only with vivid, precise orchestra playing and with brilliant stage pictures. The libretto straddles the border between high-minded whimsy and silliness. Only first-class execution can rescue it from the latter.
A Tuesday performance -- five days after the first -- was, not surprisingly, ill attended. Fear of (or boredom with) the new may have discouraged general audiences, and there was at least one devastating review of opening night's performance. The City Opera depends perhaps more heavily on reviews than the Met or the New York Philharmonic across the plaza.
To sit amid the empty seats was to move from sympathy to gratitude to sadness and finally exasperation. Francesca Zambello's frugal production could not summon the resources to keep this fragile piece aloft. Despite Act II's interesting dance sequence, sensory deprivation -- a hardscrabble dullness -- discouraged Mr. Tippett's attempts at magic. The orchestra's playing in Act I was crude to the point of rebelliousness. Mr. Keene, a better visionary than he is a conductor, seemed scarcely in control. One was torn. Was it better to see and hear this opera in failed circumstances or sit at home and imagine what it might be?
Having settled that question, listeners might move on to ask themselves this: Who else in this great musical headquarters of the world is going to put on "Die Soldaten" or "The Midsummer Marriage"? The tiny Manhattan companies operating hand-to-mouth out of of high school auditoriums might have attempted the latter 10 years ago, but these frail organisms dwindle with every year. Who else in New York is going to give a middle-income opera public the basic repertory?
The faults in these enterprises must be seen clearly and acknowledged. But we might also look beyond the intractable structural problems and the lapses in quality; mix understanding with esthetic rectitude. The New York City Opera stands between us and a large blank space in New York's musical life. It is what we have and we might learn to cherish its failures as much as its successes.

HEADLINE: The Art of the Outdoors: The French Celebrate A Garden Renaissance

BYLINE: By JOHN ROCKWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHAUMONT-SUR-LOIRE, France

 BODY:
On deftly sculptured grounds overlooking the Chateau de Chaumont and the Loire Valley, 27 landscape architects from around the world have created modest-sized gardens that reveal the variety and imagination -- and outright artistry -- of garden design today.
Open to the public until Oct. 15, the second annual International Garden Festival here is more than a feast for flower-lovers, as one might gather from the film makers, ceramists, architects and painters among its designers. It is a bold statement about the transformation of landscape architects from humble craftsmen into artists, creators of a new kind of installation art who in some cases enjoy cult followings. It is the latest manifestation of a public enthusiasm for gardening that has spread from Paris to this region in central France and will in November give birth to an ambitious new gardening conservatory on the grounds of the chateau farm. 
 Not least, it is testimony to a dramatic increase in support for gardening and historical garden restoration by the French Ministry of Culture in the Socialist era, an interest that has been redirected slightly by the present recession, but which the current Gaullist Government shows little signs of abating.
 
Responses to Problems
 The range of gardens on view is dazzling. Seven of the gardens are holdovers from last year, including a sunken grotto by Emilio Ambasz; a Moorish temple in wood perched above a floral field by Fernando Caruncho, a Spaniard, and a remarkable tunnel of curved bamboo strips by Hiroshi Teshigahara, better known as the director of Japanese films including "Woman in the Dunes" and "Rikyu."
This year's festival theme, which has generated 20 new gardens, is "The Imagination in Crisis," encouraging landscape architects to express their reactions to the world's economic, social and political problems. Each gardener has a limited space (about 2,000 square feet) and budget (about $15,000) and is obviously constrained by the terrain and climate of central France, but otherwise has complete freedom.
Mark Rudkin, a Paris-based American painter who last year designed the gardens at the Palais Royal in Paris, contributed a garden of humble, inexpensive flowers. Two designers interwove flowers with symbols of industrial and environmental decay: Stephan Tischer of Germany evoked the rusting collapse of industries in the eastern part of that country, complete with factory parts and a heap of coal, while Pierre Culot of Belgium created a collapsing ceramic wall in a stagnant pond.
For Peter Walker of the United States, the response was a series of solar panels powering pumps that sustain a field of sunflowers. In a field of smelly white tobacco flowers, the Atelier Phusis of France placed a telescope trained on architectural mediocrity in the distance. Shodo Suzuki's "Archipelago," a rock garden with shiny marble surfaces and surrounding floral groupings, was like a hidden refuge from crisis.
 
Artists, Not Adjuncts
 The 1992 festival, only two months long, attracted 60,000 visitors, and this summer's installment, which opened on July 1, is expected to lure more than 100,000. For Mr. Rudkin, who has lived mostly in France for nearly 40 years, the last decade has seen a sharp increase of French interest in gardening. "People are far more knowledgeable and sophisticated," he said in an interview at his Paris home. "They travel to see gardens now, to England and Italy, which they didn't used to do."
As an art form, gardening existed in ancient China, Egypt and Rome and has flourished in Japan over the last millennium. There have been great Western gardens since the Renaissance. Still, Mr. Rudkin added, only recently have more than a few Western landscape architects (those who have degrees) and gardeners (those who don't, like Mr. Rudkin) felt the kind of freedom that would allow them to think of themselves as artists in the modern sense.
"Most of them feel they are adjuncts to architects," he said. "They would like to think of themselves as independent artists. Of all the landscape architects that are cranked out every year, most end up working for architectural firms or in government offices in the provinces, doing plants for new buildings, which by its very nature is limited. It's rare that somebody comes along and says, 'Make me a garden.' "
That is just what Jean-Paul Pigeat has done at his Chaumont festival, and what the French Ministry of Culture and its patrimony division have encouraged in recent years. The French state has commissioned a host of highly visible gardening projects, including Mr. Rudkin's in the Palais Royal or the forthcoming redesign of the Tuileries, scheduled for completion in 1996.
 
Suddenly, There's Money
 The state budget for gardens has doubled since 1988, when Jack Lang returned to power as the Minister of Culture after a two-year conservative interregnum. The total for this year is nearly $20 million. Three-fifths of that has gone to state-owned gardens and the rest to local and regional authorities, and even to private citizens and corporations. This influx has also led to the establishment of highly successful programs, particularly the Garden Month every June, intended to encourage the French public to visit the country's many gardens.
Local and regional officials, caught up in the gardening enthusiasm, have contributed additional funds. Mr. Pigeat is a former administrator at the Pompidou Center in Paris and garden consultant in the Lang Ministry of Culture. It is no accident that Mr. Lang is the Mayor of Blois, the nearest large city to Chaumont. The prevailing political winds in the Centre region -- where Blois, Chaumont, Orleans and Tours are situated -- are conservative, not socialist. Yet Mr. Pigeat's conservatory and festival draw most of their support from regional, not national sources.
Mr. Lang's successor at the Ministry of Culture, Jacques Toubon, seems supportive of gardening policies, although general belt-tightening by the Gaullist Government has led to some cutbacks. For instance, Mr. Rudkin is not being asked to maintain his Palais Royal garden, at least on a regular and formal basis.
 
Restoration as a Priority
 Maryvonne de Saint Pulgent, who took over the Patrimony department within the ministry two months ago and hence is the responsible state official for gardens, affirmed Mr. Toubon's continued interest in the field. She even said in an interview that contrary to the recessionary trend, her own department's budget will rise slightly for 1994.
Mrs. de Saint Pulgent created something of a scandal in 1989 when, writing in the French magazine Le Point, she quoted Mr. Lang as saying that personally, he detested gardens. She now attributes the rise of interest and budgetary outlay under Mr. Lang not to him, but to the "spirit of the times" -- the public's own waxing interest in gardens -- and to the personal interest of Mr. Lang's boss, President Francois Mitterrand.
Her own interests seem more directed toward restoration than the sort of flamboyant expansions of gardening's practice and image that typified the Lang era. She did stress that garden restoration was a more fluid, flexible field than the restoration of historical monuments: "There is a less clear distinction with gardens between restoration and creation," she said. But she seemed unenthusiastic about Mr. Pigeat's friskier ideas.
 
The Next Celebrities?
 Mr. Pigeat's festival has occasioned some grumbling from more traditional landscape architects, who denounce what they see as its gimmickry. He has also had some trouble convincing large landscape-architecture firms that freeing up promising innovators on their staffs to build something as frivolous and impermanent as a summerlong garden installation was worth the firms' time and money.
At the same time, he seemed apprehensive about the very forces he has helped unleash. Landscape architects are now feeling their artistic oats. From forelock-tugging servants, akin to court composers of the 18th century, they are becoming socially lionized, media-celebrated stars. "If landscape architects become like our chefs have become, it will only harm their development," Mr. Pigeat worried.
Still, he seems determined to press forward, stretching the very idea of gardening in the way he has illustrated in his recent book, "Contemporary Parks and Gardens." New forms, he said, involve not only artistic expression but also cosmopolitan interchange among the world's gardening traditions and a new-found environmental and social sensitivity. From Sept. 27 to 29, there will be a weekend seminar at Chaumont to discuss the "Imagination in Crisis" theme. Next summer, there will be a competition to encourage young gardeners, although already this year's festival is full of work by students and even children.
Cosmopolitanism can be seen in the pervasive influence of Japanese gardening -- one of the most piquant examples being a garden by an Indian, Savita Upalekar, who was trained in Japan -- and in a cross-blending of European national styles. Mr. Rudkin said the influence of English flower gardens is particularly strong in France, which is certainly evident in his own Palais Royal design. Mr. Pigeat stressed the innovations of Americans and their "freedom from tradition."
For Mr. Rudkin, what will distinguish Mr. Pigeat's new conservatory will be its willingness to combine the formal abstraction typical of the French with a new-found enthusiasm for the practicalities of the art.
"Things have become too abstract," he said. "You have to actually go out and work in the dirt."

HEADLINE: Health Care Relief for Consumers

 BODY:
President Clinton's health care proposal, leaked to the press 10 days ago, remains confusing and worrisome. Consumers aren't sure how they will buy insurance or choose their doctors. Mr. Clinton will begin to provide answers when he addresses Congress on Wednesday night.
His answers won't please everyone. Nor will they be the last word. Congress intends to make lots of changes. Some political controversies have already surfaced. 
 Who's covered? The Clinton plan would require everyone to buy -- with the help of employers and the Federal Government -- a generous package of benefits covering doctor and hospital bills, preventive care and prescription drugs. It would limit a family's out-of-pocket costs to about $3,000 a year.
Universal coverage makes the Clinton proposal as startling as the advent of Social Security in the 1930's or the War on Poverty in the 60's. Poor children would be treated by family doctors, not physicians in hospital emergency rooms. Families would not go bankrupt paying medical bills. Yet the proposal is expensive, leading some in Congress to propose trimming the benefits.
That would be a blunder. Mr. Clinton's policy is a declaration of values that shouldn't be surrendered. Besides, a less generous package could leave many Americans worse off under reform -- sending Mr. Clinton's bill to a quick burial.
Who pays? Under the plan, employers would be required to pay about 80 percent of the average policy offered to workers; workers would pay the balance. Workers who chose more expensive plans would absorb all of the extra cost. Federal subsidies would be provided to help low-income workers, the self-employed and unemployed buy insurance.
The employer mandate has set off a political outcry. Small employers who are not now providing insurance would face paying thousands of dollars for each employee. The fear is that they will lay off workers or go out of business.
The threat is real, but exaggerated. Mr. Clinton would phase in the mandate, providing time for employers to lower wages to offset higher medical premiums. He would cap how much businesses would have to pay for health insurance and subsidize small companies with low-paid workers.
Though mandates pose risks, there's no credible alternative. A bipartisan group in the House would scrap the mandate and require people to buy insurance, with subsidies for the poor and near poor. But the idea is sure to ignite fierce opposition because it would require middle-class families to spend thousands to buy a policy they used to get from their employers. Besides, the proposal is probably too complicated to administer.
What about choice? Choice is becoming the fighting word of the President's opponents. Technically, Mr. Clinton's plan preserves choice. People would choose an insurance policy from among those made available by a regional purchasing cooperative. They could sign up with health maintenance organizations, which restrict enrollees to a fixed panel of doctors. Or they could choose fee-for-service coverage, which provides a wide choice of doctors but at considerably higher cost. There would also be hybrid plans that charge one price for using staff doctors and a higher price for using outside specialists.
Would families be able keep their doctors? Yes and no. If, as expected, fee-for-service care becomes increasingly expensive, families will flock to H.M.O.'s and many doctors will be forced to follow. Families could keep a family physician by choosing the right H.M.O. But complete freedom to choose specialists would disappear.
The Clinton plan would steer consumers toward plans that control costs. It would also open plans to everyone, without discrimination. This means that young, healthy individuals -- who used to pay the lowest rates -- would have to pay more; but the poor, the ill and workers in small businesses would gain access to the same low-cost plans that have been available only to employees at larger companies. And every plan would be required to collect and report data on treatment practices and medical outcomes -- the key to improving quality.
There are parts of the Clinton proposal -- having to do with tax policy and price controls -- that need to be changed. On the important consumer issues, however, the burden is on his critics to come up with better solutions. So far they haven't.

HEADLINE: 8 Are on Ballot Tomorrow in Scramble to Be Boston's Next Mayor

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Sept. 19

 BODY:
This was not supposed to be an election year, but the departure of Mayor Raymond L. Flynn to become Ambassador to the Vatican has left the race to succeed him wide open.
Eight candidates, including a former nun, a sheriff and a talk-show host, are on the ballot for the nonpartisan preliminary election on Tuesday. The top two finalists will face each other in November for a four-year term. 
 Boston has had only four mayors, all Democrats, since 1947. With only two candidates of Irish descent, James T. Brett and Francis M. Roache, running this time, Boston could soon have its first non-Irish mayor in more than 60 years.
 
A Field of Newcomers
 Mr. Flynn held sway here for 10 years, swamping the opposition in the 1991 election to win 75 percent of the vote. But he has not endorsed any hopeful from his posting in Rome, and his political organization has split among several candidates.
And in a city where incumbents have had a virtual lock on the job, none of the candidates have run for mayor before.
With all eight candidates, seven of them Democrats, agreeing that the next mayor of Boston must reduce crime, improve public education and stimulate the economy, they had little to fight over during the summer. But as the Red Sox's hopes for a pennant cool, the mayor's race is beginning to heat up.
 
Too Close to Call
 Polls say the race is too close to call, but they divide the field into four front-runners and four long shots. These are the top candidates:
*Thomas M. Menino, who is running on his record as Acting Mayor -- all 69 days of it. As president of the City Council, he automatically became Mayor when Mr. Flynn stepped down in July. During his brief tenure he spent $500,000 of the city's emergency fund to create summer jobs for teen-agers, and he voted against a teachers contract that he said was too expensive. He is one of the two candidates endorsed by The Boston Globe.
*Rosaria Salerno, a City Council member since 1987 who was once a Benedictine nun. She emphasizes crime prevention and education. "I believe in Boston we have two ways of doing business in politics," she says. "The political way or the right way."
*Mr. Brett, a state representative who has an uncanny resemblance to the actor Jack Nicholson and is trying to capitalize on his experience without appearing to be an insider. If the election could be won by lawn signs, he would be a shoo-in. His blue posters can be seen across town from his native Dorchester to Beacon Hill.
*Robert C. Rufo, the sheriff, who is running a law-and-order campaign that hopes to capitalize on voters' oft-mentioned concerns about crime. He says Boston is better at tracking down drivers who have outstanding parking tickets than it is at capturing criminals with outstanding warrants, and he vows to change that as mayor. He was endorsed by The Globe and The Boston Herald.
 
Hope for Long Shots
 The polls say that roughly a fifth of the voters have not yet made up their minds. This statistic keeps this second tier of candidates in the race:
*Christopher Lydon, a former New York Times reporter who is now a public-television talk-show host in Boston. One of his election promises is to go to a public school every day. "You can mark me absent if I'm not there," he said. He also says he wants to bring in the National Guard to rid the city of guns.
*Bruce C. Bolling, the only black candidate, who lost an election for an at-large City Council seat two years ago but was appointed to the post when another Council member died. His campaign calls for creating jobs to reduce crime. But black groups in a town that is 25 percent black have been split about his candidacy.
*Mr. Roache, who likes to remind voters that he reduced the crime rate as Police Commissioner. His opponents like to remind them that a city report called him a poor manager who should not be reappointed.
*Diane Moriarty, a Republican lawyer with no experience in government, who is perhaps the longest shot in this most Democratic of cities.
Interest in the race has only recently begun to perk up. Perhaps it got a little too heated last week at the second televised debate, when the discussion degenerated into a shouting match.
"Do we have a moderator here or what?" Mr. Bolling shouted above the yells of his rivals.
 
Dukakis Turns Tables
 The moderator, Kirby Perkins, could not even quiet the candidates when the time came to sign off. "Ladies and gentleman -- Mr. Brett, please," he implored. "As you can tell, it has been a very spirited discussion here today between the mayoral candidates. I would like to tell you that we can end on a quiet, civil note, but clearly they are not inclined to do that."
As the lights dimmed in the studio and the sound faded, Mr. Bolling got in the last two words: "Oh, baloney."
The next debate was held at Mr. Lydon's old station, WGBH, and was moderated by Michael S. Dukakis. The former Governor and 1988 Democratic Presidential nominee clearly relished his role grilling the former interviewer. When Mr. Lydon got off track in his response to a question about residency requirements, Mr. Dukakis pressed him: "I want an answer to the question."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 23, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the Boston mayoral election misstated the number of Irish-Americans among the eight candidates in the race. There are four; Christopher Lydon and Diane Moriarty are Irish-Americans, as are James T. Brett and Francis M. Roache.

HEADLINE: U.S. TO CONTRIBUTE $250 MILLION IN AID FOR PALESTINIANS

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher announced yesterday that the United States would provide $250 million over two years to help carry out the Israeli-Palestinian accord and called for an early international conference to more than match the American pledge.
The $250 million is only a preliminary estimate based on hasty conversations with Congress over the weekend, other senior Administration officials said. The United States is expected to present a more comprehensive five-year aid package at the conference, which is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 1 in Washington, they added. 
 About 60 percent of the aid will be in grants for public projects in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and the rest in loans and loan guarantees to spur private investment.
 
World Bank Assesses Need
 A World Bank study estimates that the Palestinians will need a minimum of $300 million a year over the next decade for public projects, a figure that also reflects how much money a nascent Palestinian infrastructure can absorb. The bank has not estimated how much money will be needed or available for private investment.
The Palestine Liberation Organization, by contrast, has drawn up a far more ambitious plan that calls for an immediate infusion of $2.5 billion in aid and $11.6 billion by the year 2000.
The Administration is hoping to raise $2 billion at the international conference for the next five years, including the American contribution,
In a speech at Columbia University yesterday in which he unveiled the Administration's strategy for the Middle East, Mr. Christopher emphasized the importance of providing money for Palestinian projects as soon as possible, both to maintain the momentum of the diplomatic breakthrough last week and to insure that the Palestinian experiment with self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho succeeds.
 
Who Will Be Invited
 With Russia as co-sponsor and the World Bank handling much of the coordination and aid, Mr. Christopher said, the United States will invite foreign and finance ministers representing Europe, Japan, Canada and the wealthy Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, Israeli and Palestinian officials, and others, whom he did not name.
"The international community must move immediately to see that the agreement produces tangible improvements in the security and daily lives of Palestinians and Israelis," Mr. Christopher said in his address, which was jointly sponsored by the School of International and Public Affairs and the Council on Foreign Relations. "If peace is to be achieved, the agreement must be translated into results quickly and vividly."
In particular, Mr. Christopher said, money must be available immediately to curb unemployment "that robs families of hope and fuels extremism," build housing and roads and help develop the groundwork for public administration, tax collection and social services.
 
'Needs Can Be Met'
 Other officials said the money would also pay for technical help for holding elections, strengthening credit institutions, aiding farmers, organizing food imports and making it easy for foreign investment.
"Given the number and commitment of our international partners, we are confident these needs can be met," Mr. Christopher said. "And we will stimulate these supporters by our own example. Working with the Congress, we expect to assemble an initial two-year package worth $250 million."
Senior Administration officials said they hoped that the world community could deliver at least $100 million to $200 million for "showcase" projects in the next two to three months. At the same time, they cautioned that the Palestinians must develop the administrative structures to receive and dispense the aid.
President Clinton will appoint a special coordinator to manage Palestinian aid and a task force of Jewish- and Arab-Americans to help the Administration develop joint projects and private investment, Mr. Christopher said.
But Mr. Christopher did not say and other officials could not explain why the United States was not being host to a more ambitious global conference that would include economically healthy countries with the ability to contribute aid, like Brunei, Singapore and Korea, as well as poorer countries that over the decades have embraced the Palestinian cause and could offer symbolically important contributions.
 
$150 Million in Grants
 The United Nations held a largely symbolic global conference of donors in 1986 to raise money to revive devastated African economies, although none of the donor nations made specific commitments on aid and debt relief.
About $150 million of the $250 million in American aid in the first two years will be in outright grants; the remainder will be in loans, loan guarantees and political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a Government agency, to help American businesses invest in Gaza and Jericho.
By contrast, the United States gives Israel $3 billion and Egypt $2.1 billion a year in aid -- more than one-third of the entire American foreign aid budget. Much of this aid is military.
In lobbying for an ambitious aid package for Russia in recent months, the Administration was faced with a growing chorus of lawmakers who suggested that Israel and Egypt might have to sacrifice some of their aid, which has remained fairly constant since the 1979 peace treaty between them.
But both Mr. Clinton and Mr. Christopher have vowed to maintain aid to Israel and Egypt at the current levels, and since last week's Israeli-Palestinian agreement, the sentiment on Capitol Hill is to pour more, rather than less, money into the region.

HEADLINE: ASBESTOS IN THE SCHOOLS;
Disorder on Day 1 in New York Schools

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
Most of New York City's public schools reopened smoothly yesterday amid a general sense of relief that the asbestos delay was over, but for thousands of students still locked out of class and for their beleaguered parents, the day brought deep confusion, disappointment and frustration.
More than 100 school buildings remained closed, representing 10 percent of the system, more than double what officials had expected. Ninety others were on reduced or rearranged schedules because so many rooms had to be sealed until asbestos inspections or cleanups could be completed.
 
Telephone Service Affected
 Two school districts -- District 12, in the East Tremont section of the Bronx, and District 19, in the East New York section of Brooklyn -- decided not to open any of their schools despite entreaties from central headquarters. But District 12 announced last evening that only 3 of its 28 schools would remain closed today. District 19 said that 2 of its 27 schools would not open. 
 Of the city's one million schoolchildren, an estimated 60,000 were either out of school or in different schools -- a number that alone would form a respectable city school district, about the same size as San Francisco's. The sheer magnitude of disruptions in the nation's largest school system was such that telephone service was erratic into the 718 area code yesterday as thousands of parents called the school board's asbestos information line.
The opening was the most tumultuous since the consolidation of schools in 1898, officials acknowledged. Not only was the 11-day delay the longest in 25 years, since the bitter teacher's strike in 1968, never before have so many schools been partly or fully closed.
 
Some Chaos
 The worst mayhem that some had imagined never happened as parents answered the challenge of the new Schools Chancellor, Ramon C. Cortines, and pitched in everywhere -- creating command posts in newly painted cafeterias for their small armies of tots and establishing telephone relays to distribute the latest information. "It exceeded what I believed we as a community could do," Mr. Cortines said.
He emphasized that the degree of normality was a relief. "I think that in more than 90 percent of the schools it was not chaotic," he said. "When there was chaos, it was real chaos."
There was one violent incident, but school officials said it bore no relation to the asbestos crisis. An 18-year-old student was stabbed in the neck in a stairwell at Seward Park High School, and was in critical condition. A 17-year-old student surrendered and was charged with murder.
Many thousands of students -- from kindergarten children to autistic teen-agers -- arrived at school yesterday to find their school buildings closed. Some were bused to other schools, while others were sent to libraries, offices, auditoriums, churches and social clubs. In one Bronx school, 125 kindergarten children were herded into rooms that were bare but for a piece of carpeting; the last-minute disruptions delayed a furniture delivery.
The board has prepared teaching materials and a videotape about asbestos for presentation to students and teachers in school classrooms.
At Junior High School 168 in Queens, dozens of teachers and students showed up only to learn the school would not open after all. Instead, they are to crowd into nearby Intermediate School 237 today.
Jane Evans, a social-studies teacher at J.H.S. 168 , said: "They're pretending that this is going to be education, but it's not. This is baby-sitting."
Across the city, children with new shoes and backpacks were accompanied by parents or grandparents, aunts or uncles, arriving at school in the sunshine of a crisp autumn morning. In the schools that were opened, students caught up with friends, checked their class schedules and found their lockers. Many seemed grateful to be in school.
"I wanted to come back so badly," said Danelle St. Agathe, an 11-year-old, who returned yesterday to classes at Public School 234 in TriBeCa. "At home you really have nothing to do, but at school there are things to keep you busy."
 
'We've Been Duped'
 As a general sense of relief spread through most of the city, the scenes of confusion were widespread and deep. One of the most chaotic was at P.S. 27 in Brooklyn's Red Hook section, which school officials ordered closed on Sunday. The school's students were bused to P.S. 15, where they learned they would be sitting in an auditorium, doing no work.
"I think we've been duped," said Beatrice Byrd, a teacher at P.S. 27 when she heard of the plan. "We're educators, but we're standing here feeling ignorant."
Rosemarie Negron, whose 9-year-old daughter Shalimar was to enter the fifth grade at P.S. 27, said the worst part was the uncertainty.
"We're not sure yet when or where they'll start classes, how they'll get there, or even when the repair work is going to begin," Ms. Negron said. "We have no idea at all. Its very frustrating."
The asbestos crisis emerged Aug. 6, when investigators announced that previous inspections of all the city's schools were unreliable.
Asbestos particles can cause cancer when inhaled in high concentrations over decades, but some health experts have questioned the severity of the hazard posed by asbestos in buildings. Nonetheless, Federal laws require strict inventories and management of asbestos in schools, and Mayor David N. Dinkins ordered every school rechecked before the opening day of school. The enormousness of the task made that impossible.
Some 1,015,500 students enrolled to attend the public schools this year, about 20,000 more than last year. It was the first opening day in 16 years that more than one million students were registered, said Frank Sobrino, a board of education spokesman.
There were no estimates of how many attended classes yesterday, an important issue since attendance is used to calculate state aid, which comprises $2.9 billion of the city's $7.9 billion school budget this year. If average attendance drops, the city could lose some state money, said Pat Keegan, a spokeswoman for the State Education Department.
Almost overlooked amid the asbestos crisis were the inaugurations yesterday of 32 new specialized high schools, a sweeping addition to the city's secondary system that has drawn national attention. They included additions like the El Puente Academy in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where students are to study science by organizing a vaccination campaign, and the High School for Economics and Finance in Manhattan, where classrooms will simulate a corporate office.
A total of 110 schools failed to open yesterday, most of them elementary and junior highs, officials said. Of those, 50 were in Districts 12 in the Bronx and District 19 in Brooklyn. An additional 44 were lower schools scattered across the city's other 30 community districts. Two were high school buildings: Concord High School on Staten Island and the old Stuyvesant high school in Manhattan, which houses three secondary programs. Fourteen were special education schools.
Some 32,000 students enrolled at schools that were closed were bused to alternate sites, Mr. Sobrino said.
The volume of calls to the special telephone numbers set up by the central Board of Education was so heavy that most callers got only busy signals in the hour before school began. The board had hired 40 operators, but they were swamped.
Some of the 110 schools will be opening today, but officials could not specify which ones. Others, however, may take significantly more time. Mr. Cortines said that most of the schools that failed to open yesterday would open within two weeks.
 
A Late Decision
 District 12 and District 19 were the only entire districts that failed to open. In both cases, local school boards voted late Sunday to keep their schools closed. In District 19, the vote came after more than 100 parents rallied at district headquarters. "The parents were frightened about the asbestos, and didn't want the schools to open," said Corinna Grant, a school board member.
The late vote left no time to notify the district's parents, and yesterday morning large crowds of muttering, confused parents gathered outside many of the district's schools.
"It wasn't in the papers, it wasn't on the news," said Keith McCrae, who brought his 5-year-old son to register at P.S. 158 for kindergarten. "I feel terrible."
Another school that failed to open -- also at the last minute -- was P.S. 42 in Chinatown, where officials discovered extensive asbestos deposits in wall plaster early Sunday. A nonprofit community group, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolency Association, offered to lease space for 750 students in a nearby private school until the cleanup can be completed.
"People responded in the good ways that New Yorkers respond when there is a crisis," said Andrew Lachman, a spokesman for Manhattan's District 2.

HEADLINE: Angola's Return to War Scars Its People, and Now Its Cities

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUANDA, Angola, Sept. 20

 BODY:
The most arresting evidence of Angola's agony is anecdotal.
It is the grasshopper-thin children of war-encircled Malanje lining up for soybean gruel at under-supplied relief kitchens. It is the shrieks and whimpers in the trauma ward of Luanda's biggest hospital, where doctors stitch wounds without painkillers. It is the legion of limbless men and women maimed while foraging for food in fields now salted with land mines. 
 The scale of the catastrophe is impossible to know, but by almost all accounts the suffering since Angola returned to civil war last October exceeds anything in its previous 16 years of factional conflict.
 
War Touches the Cities
 While the earlier fighting between the rebels of Jonas Savimbi and the Government of Jose Eduardo dos Santos was predominantly a guerrilla bush war, this time the victims are residents of towns and cities where the earlier fighting rarely intruded.
Besides killing an estimated 50,000 people, mostly civilians, the last year of war has inflated food prices beyond the reach of people once considered middle class, and has dismembered parts of the economy that functioned through the earlier years of war, throwing a potentially prosperous country back into an age of subsistence farming and barter.
The breakdown of ordinary commerce is compounded by pervasive corruption that diverts much of the food and medicine intended for the needy, and by the skewed priorities of the Marxist Government, which recently spent $500 million of its desperately scarce cash importing Volkswagens and Audis to sell to its generals and ministers at a fraction of their cost.
The waste is so brazen that even the official press cannot ignore it. After the automobile giveaway, state television took to describing the Parliament as the "Audi-torium."
Relief workers here, competing for the Western world's limited attention, liken the suffering to Somalia and Bosnia.
Alouine Blondin Beye, the United Nations special representative here, says at least 1,000 people, mostly civilians, are dying each day of the war's consequences, including hunger and disease, and two million more to face the danger of famine.
With much of the country cut off from view behind rebel lines, relief officials concede, no one really knows if these guesses are accurate.
The universal lament of officials and relief workers here is that the West, which invested so much in arming Angola during its years of civil war, now pays little attention to its pain.
For many years the United States and South Africa sponsored Mr. Savimbi's guerrillas against a Government aided by the Soviet Union and Cuba. In May the United States recognized the dos Santos Government as legitimate on the basis of elections last September, but Mr. Savimbi has refused to accept his defeat in that vote.
 
Not Enough Pledges
 Mr. Beye said the United Nations budgeted $226 million for humanitarian relief this year, but member countries pledged only $88 million. The largest donor is the United States, which has earmarked about $60 million.
The pervasive corruption has added to the reluctance of potential donors, who fear what they contribute will be diverted to the war effort or looted from the docks of Luanda to reappear in this city's Roque Santiero market, a vast pirate bazaar named for the rascally hero of a popular Brazilian soap opera.
In the fly-blown wards of the country's main hospital, a pillared colonial hulk overlooking Luanda, doctors are so short of medicine that instead of writing prescriptions, they write shopping lists. Patients with money pass the lists to relatives, who then search for stolen antibiotics or bandages in the stalls of Roque Santiero market.
A capsule of painkiller costs two days' pay for someone lucky enough to have a job. But many of those writhing in filthy sheets in the trauma ward have been airlifted in from besieged areas where no payroll has arrived since January.
Luis Upeme, a 57-year-old truck driver who stepped on a land mine while scavenging for roots outside the town of Menongue, lay sprawled on a blanket in a crowded corridor cradling the stump of his left leg.
Although Menongue is surrounded by rebel guerrillas, he said disgustedly, he has begged the doctors to send him home.
"In Menongue, we had beds," he said.
Some of Angola's victims are direct casualties of a war that, in its current phase, has little sympathy for civilians.
Each day Mr. Savimbi's rebels shell the city of Cuito, where a small army garrison has held out since January. Each day the Government sends MIG fighters to rain bombs on the city of Huambo, Mr. Savimbi's headquarters. Both cities, capitals of neighboring provinces in Angola's central highlands, are symbolic prizes of little military value.
In the early months of renewed fighting, the most desperate victims were the refugees uprooted from the highlands and forced to flee, often for weeks on foot, to the twin coastal cities of Lobito and Benguela. There they sought shelter in tent cities run by foreign relief agencies.
But recently relief workers discovered a startling paradox.
"One day we woke up and we saw the people in the cities were in worse condition than those we were supporting in the camps," said Philippe Borel, director of operations in Luanda for the United Nations World Food Program, the main supplier and logistical backbone of the foreign aid network.
In October, after Mr. Savimbi denounced the elections as rigged and returned to war, his rebels blew up all the bridges that had been rebuilt during 16 months of peace, paralyzing the railroad, Lobito's huge port, and most of the industry in the two cities.
Relief workers have now opened soup kitchens for city dwellers suffering from malnutrition because they had no money.
Of the areas reached by reporters and relief workers, the most shocking is Malanje, unmolested in the earlier civil war but now cut off to all traffic except by air.
The World Food Program has been airlifting in food for 50,000 people, but the population has swollen to 250,000 by villagers fleeing the war. It is the one city where it is common to see famished stick-children like those of Somalia or Sudan.
In other cities that have been isolated by rebel attacks, such as Luena and Menongue, the hunger is less dramatic so far, but refugees from the cities say the threat of starvation is growing.
About a third of Angola's 12 million people live in rebel territory, where only the Catholic relief agency, Caritas, is allowed to operate.
Oscar Bragga, the Catholic bishop of Benguela Province and president of Caritas, said based on his sketchy reports the situation is worse in rebel-held areas.
"Unita has no supplies, and in any case the rebels have never supplied the civilian population of areas under their control," he said. On the contrary, Unita is famous for living off the local population, and then destroying as much as possible when it is forced to evacuate.
 
Hazards of Agriculture
 With an estimated 2 million Angolans displaced and great swaths of land mined, much farmland is going unplanted. Even digging for manioc root, a starchy African staple, is hazardous.
In cities not directly touched by the war, like Luanda and Lobito, raging inflation fueled by war spending and money-printing has created a sense of economic desperation.
For a low-level civil servant earning 400,000 kwanzas a month -- about $8 -- a 25-cent loaf of bread begins to look like a luxury.
About the only true bargain is gasoline. The Government, which controls the oil-rich Cabinda Province, is reported to have sold its future oil income for the next three years to get money for weapons, but it still sells gasoline to motorists at about 13 cents a tankful.
Unable to slow inflation, the Government has concentrated on making it less cumbersome. A newspaper ad this week boasted that a new 100,000 kwanza bank note, coming soon, would provide "more value, less volume."
Mercedes Sayagues of the World Food Program said many of the agency's local employees have asked to be paid in food, because the money is worthless.
"The Angolan economy has disappeared," she said. "It's all barter."
Amazingly, people get by. They pick over garbage piles. They buy 110-pound bags of corn and resell it by the cupful to those even poorer. Thievery is commonplace, from orderlies who steal pills from patients' bedsides and dock workers who stuff their pants with corn, to the disappearance of entire shipping containers.
"The worst shortage," said a Russian doctor in Lobito, "is a shortage of honest people. And what else can you expect in a place where people are hungry?"

HEADLINE: Japanese Say They Plan to Relax Restrictions on Foreign Lawyers

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 20

 BODY:
When Japanese talk about what's wrong with America, they usually list crime, urban decay and a proliferation of lawyers. A total ban on foreign lawyers here was eased six years ago, with little ill effect, but members of the Japanese bar still say they have visions of being overwhelmed by overpaid talent who would pollute the Japanese system with an oil slick of litigation.
As a result, foreign lawyers operating here have been forced to navigate a forest of obstacles. They have been barred from hiring Japanese lawyers, giving their clients advice on Japanese law, or even arguing cases in court. 
 But now, after years of haggling and growing international pressure, the Japanese Government and its powerful bar association say they are close to lifting many of the restrictions on foreign lawyers, even paving the way for Japan's roughly 14,000 lawyers -- fewer than you can find on some city blocks in Washington -- to team up with the invaders.
 
Partnerships to Be Allowed
 For example, under the new rules, which will be announced next week but not formally adopted by Parliament until next year at the earliest, foreign law firms will be allowed to form partnerships with their Japanese counterparts. That, in turn, will enable them to hire Japanese lawyers and to advise clients on the worldwide legal implications of business deals.
Some American lawyers suggest that these changes do not go far enough, because American firms will still be barred from hiring Japanese lawyers on their own rather than as part of a joint venture.
"There are still major restrictions, especially on Japanese lawyers who want to become partners in multinational law firms," said Donald Morgan, a partner in the Tokyo office of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton.
The treatment of American and other foreign law firms here has been a major source of trade tension between Washington and Tokyo for years and recently an issue in the Uruguay round of international trade talks.
Some of the biggest and most influential Wall Street firms haved argued that they have been kept from fully competing for the most lucrative legal business in Japan, while Japanese lawyers have a far easier time practicing in the United States.
 
Fear of Competition
 The powerful Japan Federation of Bar Associations has expressed fears that its members would be overwhelmed by high-powered American and British firms, which they say would bring a combative, litigious culture to a legal community that operates, at least on the surface, by a different tradition. But some Japanese lawyers concede that the real issue is one of competition.
It is unclear whether the new rules will reverse the fortunes of the large American firms here. Many are believed to be losing money on their Tokyo offices, especially in a time of economic downturn. But by allowing foreign and Japanese firms to form joint ventures, the new regulations may make it possible for the foreigners to offer "one-stop shopping," no longer forcing them to refer clients to a separate Japanese firm for advice on how their real estate deals or business ventures are affected by Japanese law.
"There have been demands for liberalization, and we think that this will be a very important step toward the deregulation of the legal system," said Osamu Horino, the secretary general of the bar association group.
Until 1987 foreign lawyers, with a handful of exceptions, were barred from practicing in Japan at all, except as "trainees" to Japanese companies or law firms. Since then several dozen firms have been accredited, most from the United States and Europe.
 
Continually Changing Names
 But the relationship between the foreign lawyers and the Japanese bar has been an uneasy one. American firms, for example, have not been permitted to identify themselves by name. Instead, they must go by the names of the lawyers from the parent firm who have been admitted to practice here.
Thus, the Cleary Gottlieb office is known as Morgan Beller Terai Gaikokuho Jimu Bengoshi. The first three names are the names of the lawyers in Tokyo; the last three words mean "foreign business lawyer." Every time a lawyer moves in or out of the office, the local firm's name has changed.
Under the new regulations, firms will be allowed to use the same names they use elsewhere in the world.
But if the name issue has been an annoyance, the restriction on hiring has been a major impediment. Some Japanese lawyers have said they fear that American firms will lure away young Japanese lawyers with offers of high salaries.
And they argue that Japanese lawyers come from a different tradition. For example, the Government pays for the legal education of anyone who survives the grueling bar exam here, which has a pass rate of less than 2 percent. It also controls that education: there is one national law school, and all of the nation's lawyers and judges must pass through its doors.
While some Americans cite the small size of Japan's bar as a competitive advantage for Japanese businesses, the numbers are misleading.
Though there are slightly more than 14,000 bengoshi, or lawyers who have passed the bar exam, tens of thousands of other professionals do work that in the United States only lawyers would be qualified to perform.
By contrast, the American Bar Association estimates that 845,000 to 850,000 lawyers practice in the United States.
Japanese Government officials said they hoped to be able to present the new rules during trade negotiations, and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was reported in the Japanese press to be ready to discuss the issue with President Clinton next week.

HEADLINE: Many Experts Say Health Plan Would Fall Far Short on Savings

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
A wide range of experts, including economists, consultants and members of Congress, say President Clinton's health care plan will not cut costs nearly as much as the Administration hopes and will actually increase the Federal budget deficit instead of cutting it, as the Administration promises.
In a series of interviews, the experts, both Democratic and Republican, used terms like "not credible," "difficult," "wildly optimistic" and "illusory" to describe the President's plans. 
 Critics say the only way the Administration could achieve such savings is through broad cuts in medical services -- which they say would probably be politically unacceptable. They assert, for example, that much of the planned $124 billion in Medicare cuts are politically and technically impossible to carry out by the year 2000.
 
Checked and Rechecked?
 "It's very ambitious," said Henry Aaron, an economist and a health policy expert at the Brookings Institution. "My feeling is they're reaching a long way for cost containment. Technically, it's not impossible. The question is whether it's politically achievable and sustainable."
But Administration officials argue that there is so much inefficiency, waste and fraud in the system that huge savings can be squeezed out with more competition and efficiency. They assert that their financing estimates have been put together in good faith, contain line-by-line spending cuts and have been checked and rechecked.
"If you look at these numbers, they come from a process that is unprecedented," Hillary Rodham Clinton told reporters today. Earlier today, she met with more than 200 members of Congress and told them that major savings could be made in Medicare and Medicaid. [Page A18.]
 
Attacking the Deficit
 A draft of the plan given to members of Congress shows that by 1998 the Administration plans to slash in half the growth in the nation's overall health care spending -- government and private -- which is rising by 9.4 percent a year.
The plan also projects roughly $350 billion in new Federal health spending from 1994 to 2000 but estimates that the Government will raise $441 billion in the same period, through new revenues and cuts in existing programs. This would leave $91 billion to cut the Federal budget deficit.
A vigorous debate has erupted over the health care plan even before President Clinton presents it in a speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. Administration officials said they were still deciding details of the plan, including how it would be paid for.
Many of the experts interviewed were skeptical, based on what they know so far, that the Administration could achieve the savings it envisions. The draft of the plan also promises to cut the growth in private health care spending in half by 1999 and to slash by more than half the 11.6 percent annual growth in the Medicare program for the elderly from 1994 to 1998.
"It seems like an awfully big bite over that period of time," said Lawrence S. Lewin, chairman of Lewin-VHI, a health-policy consulting firm. He said he was sympathetic with the Administration's proposals but suggested that it was promising too much too fast.
 
Moynihan Weighs In
 A failure to hold down health costs as much as projected could erase any planned deficit reduction stemming from the plan.
On the NBC News program "Meet the Press" on Sunday, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, questioned the Administration's promise to hold down Medicare and Medicaid spending and cut the budget deficit, calling it "fantasy."
Today he voiced confidence that Congress would approve health care legislation. "We're going to do this," he said. But he added, "We could spoil it all by saying, 'And in addition, we're going to have $91 billion in deficit reduction.' "
Administration officials responded that even if the plan does not achieve the $91 billion in deficit reduction, it will still pay for itself.
One fear is that lower-than-expected savings would cause health insurance premiums to rise, forcing the Government to pay far more than the $160 billion in subsidies it plans for low-income workers and small businesses from 1994 to 2000.
Several health care experts said the amount of cost containment planned would be more credible if the Administration planned to make the cuts over a dozen years, not in half that time.
Expanding on his "fantasy" description Sunday, Senator Moynihan said: "These numbers all come out of their computer in that way. They won't last, they mustn't last."
Mrs. Clinton vigorously defended the credibility of the plan's finances when she met with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill last week. A participant at the meeting quoted her as saying, "We have looked at the numbers very carefully, we have been relentless, including checking our procedures and our modeling methods."
 
Memories of Reagan
 In discussing the Clinton health changes, some economists sound as skeptical as they did when President Ronald Reagan pledged to increase Pentagon spending, cut taxes and reduce the budget deficit all at once. These economists wonder how Mr. Clinton's plan can extend health coverage to 37 million uninsured Americans, offer important new services like long-term home health care and still promise to reduce the deficit by $91 billion from 1994 to 2000.
"The deficit reduction piece is the ultimate touch of chutzpah in what is one of the most unrealistic financing schemes I've ever seen," said Gail Wilensky, a health care expert who administered the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President George Bush. "I expected a more modest benefit package and a real but not too painful tax increase, or else more expensive benefits linked to a larger, more painful tax increase. I was surprised when they proposed big benefits but little in the way of taxes. The financing isn't credible."
The Administration says its plan will hold down the increase in Medicare and Medicaid spending by $238 billion from 1994 to 2000 and save $47 billion in other Federal programs. The plan anticipates collecting $105 billion in taxes on tobacco and possibly alcohol and $51 billion in higher income taxes. Officials say those tax revenues will result from a rise in wages that is expected to occur because companies will in theory have more money to pay workers, thanks to lower health care costs. All told, this comes to $441 billion in savings and revenues.
Over the same period, the plan calls for $80 billion for a new long-term care program, $72 billion for a new prescription drug plan and $29 billion for administration, mainly to set up and run regional health alliances to provide health coverage in all 50 states. The plan's big hope is that these alliances will squeeze down costs by driving hard bargains when they purchase health care from networks of doctors, hospitals and insurers.
 
Subsidies Called For
 The plan also calls for $169 billion in subsidies for companies and low-income workers who cannot pay their share of the cost of insurance. All this means $350 billion in new Federal spending from 1994 to 2000.
Several economists said they would feel more comfortable about the financing if the Administration relied less on ambitious cost-cutting and more on taxes. But if President Clinton learned anything from the bruising budget battle, it is that the public has little appetite for new taxes. In many ways, the Clinton plan is promising just what the American people want and have grown used to: more services than they are willing to pay for because of their disdain for taxes.
Administration officials say they have done hard-headed economic analysis showing that they can cut overall health care spending by 9 percent by the year 2000, to $1.49 trillion from $1.63 trillion. They argue that huge savings are available by infusing more competition into the system and by reducing inefficiency, waste and abuse.
At the same time, by extending coverage to all Americans, the plan is expected to create 6 to 10 percent more demand for health care services. By offering more services and still reducing overall spending, the plan thus aims to squeeze actual costs by at least 15 percent.
"The savings we project are perfectly reasonable when you recognize that health care provided by H.M.O.'s is 15 percent cheaper than regular fee-for-service," said Alan Blinder, a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
Probably the area that health care experts are most skeptical about is the Administration's plan to cut Medicare spending by $124 billion from 1994 to 2000. Some said the Administration would be lucky to cut it by half that.
"They are suggesting that they would cut Medicare growth, after inflation, to 0 or 1 percent by 1996," said Representative Fortney H. (Pete) Stark, a California Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee's Subcommittee on Health. "Politically, that will be difficult after we've already cut $60 billion out as part of the budget package. But even if Congress approves, it's unrealistic to think they can cut it that much. I would argue we could get Medicare down to 5 or 6 percent a year in spending growth."
Senator Moynihan was also skeptical of the Administration's ability to bring Medicare's double-digit spending increases down to zero by the end of the decade. To make such a prediction, he said, "is to have lost touch with reality."

HEADLINE: Deflate Government? Helium Didn't

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMARILLO, Tex., Sept. 17

 BODY:
When the Clinton Administration set out to streamline government, a lot of budget watchdogs said there was no better place to start than at the helium reserve here, a cluster of mines, pipes and cooling vats that was $1.3 billion in debt and 100 years ahead on the supply curve.
But when President Clinton's National Performance Review finally focused on the cold-war-era complex this month, it suggested that Congress cancel the program's debt and issued a vague call to "increase efficiencies in helium operations." 
 Rather than becoming a model of "reinvented" government, the helium reserve -- begun in the 1920's to inflate blimps and used today by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in its spacecraft -- became instead a model of how politics and economics can sometimes converge to spare seemingly unnecessary programs.
 
Talking About Helium
 The politics was simple. Amarillo's Congressman, Bill Sarpalius, a conservative Democrat who proved to be a crucial vote in favor of the President's budget bill last month, spoke to Mr. Clinton four times on the day of the vote, repeatedly bringing up his concern about preserving the program, which provides 220 jobs in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle.
"Sure I talked to the President about helium," Mr. Sarpalius said in an interview. "I talk to everyone I can in the Government about helium. And when I had the opportunity to explain to him that this was not really a billion-dollar loss, that this is a program that makes money for the Federal Government, that there's another side to this picture, he was fascinated by it. He was really interested in helium."
Critics of the debt-ridden program, which was bolstered in the 1960's amid fears that America might run out of helium as its space program was rushing to put men on the moon, have urged that it be abolished or privatized. "We may conceivably in the future need ermine pelts and Grand Marnier," said Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union. "That doesn't mean the Federal Government needs to be in charge of stockpiling them."
But L. Dale Bippus, who as general manager of the Federal Helium Reserve of the Bureau of Mines oversees a stockpile of 32 billion cubic feet of the gas, enough to supply current Federal demands for the next 100 years, boasts of the Federal program with the huge surplus -- of helium. "We're the Fort Knox of helium," he said. "It was a wise investment, I think. We've got a tremendous asset here that we acquired at a reasonable price."
The economics of helium is complex. But, in essence, the problem is this: Although the Government is sitting atop a helium supply worth $1.6 billion at today's prices, there is no way it can simply sell off the gas and give the cash to the Treasury.
Doing so, virtually everyone agrees, would lead to a collapse in the world helium market, quickly dropping the price to pennies on the taxpayers' investment dollars. As expensive as it was to get into the helium program, it could prove even more costly to leave.
And so the federally owned helium sits in an underground mine, trapped beneath a layer of impermeable rock and released only when a Federal agency calls for it.
Odorless and colorless, helium has the valuable property of remaining gaseous to the extremely low temperature of minus 452 degrees. It is used mostly by NASA, which relies on supercooled helium to pressurize fuel tanks and to act as a copllant, and by the Defense Department for rockets and research.
 
Inflated Projections
 Financially speaking, projections in 1960 that the Government would make money in the helium business proved wildly inflated. Founded with a taxpayer loan of $352 million, the program is now $1.3 billion in debt, even though the Government charges its own agencies 20 percent more for helium than the going rate in private industry. Not that it has to worry about the competition: Federal law prohibits Federal agencies from buying helium anywhere except at the Federal reserve.
Defenders of the reserve say it is a moneymaker because it returned $28 million to the Treasury last year while costing only $15 million to operate. But critics say these figures are misleading because it is all Government money anyway.
In any event, the figures do not take into account the cost of servicing the debt. To pay that off by the statutory deadline of 1995, the General Accounting Office calculated in a report last year, the reserve would have to charge $3,000 per 1,000 cubic feet -- enough to inflate a 12-foot balloon -- on all sales in the next two years; its current price is $55, and private industry charges about $46.
"It's an affront to the free enterprise system," said Representative C. Christopher Cox, a Republican from Orange County, Calif., who has emerged as the chief Congressional critic of the reserve. "It's a hoary example of socialism, of state-run industry, at a time when the whole world has rejected socialism."
Mr. Cox has introduced an amendment to the National Helium Act of 1960 that would allow NASA, which bought 131 million cubic feet of helium in the last fiscal year, to buy helium privately. These suppliers already provide all the helium bought by non-Government customers, which account for about 90 percent of the helium used in the United States. While it is most commonly used to inflate children's balloons, helium is also used for things as varied as welding and magnetic resonance imaging.
The Cox amendment passed in the House but is languishing in the Senate. Whatever its fate, there is tremendous pressure from the private suppliers -- including Exxon, Enron, Mobil and other major corporations -- against the reverse concept: allowing the Government to sell gas to private customers.
And Mr. Bippus said: "I don't think the Government's job is to try to put private industry out of business."
 
'What Are We Going to Do?'
 But Mr. Bippus, on a tour of the complex here, said he was frustrated at the derision directed at his agency, where he has worked for the 37 years. And he was angry that the critics -- including Mr. Cox and P. J. O'Rourke, the humorist who in his 1991 book "Parliament of Whores" called the helium program "amazingly stupid, even by government standards" -- had never even bothered to come out to Amarillo.
"Well, we own it, so what are we going to do with it?" Mr. Bippus asked. "Are you just going to vent it out into the air? I could blow all this helium into the atmosphere. Is that going to make you feel better?"
For reasons unclear to geologists, the United States has the world's greatest concentrations of helium, mainly in Wyoming and in a field that stretches through the Texas Panhandle and into Oklahoma and Kansas.
The Federal helium program dates to 1925, when the Government refined the gas for use in blimps, then an emerging vehicle for use in war. The Germans desperately wanted it for their zeppelins, but the United States said no, so the Germans turned to flammable hydrogen, at least until the Hindenburg explosion in 1937.
 
'Helium Capital of the World'
 Today, less than 1 percent of the Government's helium is used for blimps, although there have been persistent reports that the Pentagon is working on a classified, helium-inflated spy craft referred to in military circles as the "stealth blimp."
There is no question that helium is important to Amarillo. Inscribed on the front of the local telephone directory is: "Amarillo is proud to be the helium capital of the world."
Mr. Cox said: 'No one ought to begrudge Bill Sarpalius his defense of this boondoggle. It's his job as a Congressman to defend it. But everybody in Congress votes on it, and not everybody in Congress is from Amarillo."
But Mr. Sarpalius insisted he was not protecting any local pork-barrel project, and instead believed he had persuaded the President of the program's merits. "If you're asking was there a tradeoff," he said, referring to his vote in favor of Mr. Clinton's budget, "there wasn't a tradeoff."
And out where the helium is kept, Mr. Bippus said that decades from now important new uses for helium would probably be discovered, and Americans would praise the Government's foresight in stockpiling it. "But it really comes down to this," he added. "If you could tell me what the future demand for helium was going to be, I could tell you whether this was a good investment."

HEADLINE: Cuban Refugees Tangle Mexican Diplomacy

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Sept. 20

 BODY:
A series of incidents involving Cuban refugees headed for the United States has brought Mexico's traditional friendliness with Cuba into new conflict with its effort to win approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The largest group, 72 Cubans, crept under a garden wall at Mexico's embassy in the Dominican Republic on Thursday, refusing to leave unless Mexico helped them get to Miami. 
 Like two similar cases, the incident in Santo Domingo has been complicated by American politics. In those cases, the refugees ultimately were allowed to travel on, but this time Mexico has refused, saying it will not act as a consular intermediary.
Cuban-American leaders, who support the flight of refugees, have pressed Mexico to change its mind, threatening to muster what influence they can against the trade agreement.
Representative Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a South Florida Republican, said at least a few legislators from predominantly Cuban-American districts plan to vote against the trade pact already, in part because they are critical of Mexico's relations with Cuba.
Mexican officials say that they fear that anger over the refugee problem could further imperil the accord.
"We do not need any explosive issue to come up which is going to interfere with what is already a very difficult process," a senior Mexican official said, explaining the efforts to placate Cuban-American groups. "It is a relatively small price to pay."
Last month, the Mexican Navy picked up eight refugees off the Yucatan Peninsula. Seven others had died when their boat sank. Mexico deported the survivors, an act that led to protests by Cuban-Americans in Miami.
Within a week, the decision was reversed and the Cubans were returned to Mexico and given visas. The Mexican Consul in Miami, Bulmaro Pacheco, made the announcement in a news conference with the Cuban American National Foundation, a lobbying group Mexico has criticized in the past.
The Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, Jose Fernandez de Cossio, said Cuba did not oppose the departures of the shipwreck victims or of 11 Cubans who walked into the Mexican Embassy in Havana on Sept. 9 and refused to leave when political asylum was denied.
He insisted that those incidents had not hurt relations with Mexico. But the Cuban Government reacted sharply to the occupation of the Mexican Embassy in Santo Domingo.
"I think all of this is orchestrated," President Fidel Castro told La Jornada, a Mexico City newspaper. "It is the most provocative elements of the counterrevolution, the most recalcitrant enemies of Cuba, and those who want to create problems for Cuba and problems for the friends of Cuba."
Although Mexico said it is determined to stop the flow of refugees, the problem continues. Today officials reported that six more Cubans rescued from a sinking boat off the Cayman Islands had arrived in Veracruz, seeking safe passage to the United States. They were given temporary visas for Mexico.
 Amicable relations toward the Communist Government in Cuba have long been viewed in Mexico as a measure of foreign-policy independence from the United States. Over the last decade, Mexico has granted thousands of visas to Cubans but has never given them asylum, said a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Carlos Reta Martinez.
Prompted by fears of turmoil in Cuba, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's administration has quietly pressed Cuba to ease economic and political controls.

HEADLINE: Britain May Act on Paris Trade Stance

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Tuesday, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Britain, angered by what it sees as repeated French stalling on international trade talks, threatened on Monday to boycott European Community meetings if no world trade accord is reached by Dec. 15.
The British statement, made by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd at a European Community foreign and farm ministers meeting here, amounted to an extraordinary threat to paralyze the activities of the 12-nation community. The so-called empty chair policy was last employed by France in 1965 to immobilize the community over a budgetary dispute. 
 A British Government spokesman quoted Mr. Hurd as telling the meeting that it was inconceivable that "the European Community could proceed with normal business if it was seen as having caused the collapse of the Uruguay Round of trade talks."
Asked how normal business would be disrupted, the spokesman said Britain, and perhaps other states, could boycott meetings, provoking what he called "a community crisis."
Early this morning, the ministers reached an agreement on a statement that was vague enough to bridge the differences between the French and British positions.
But the British outburst reflected growing exasperation in London -- widely shared in Washington -- over the insistence, reiterated on Monday, of the center-right French Government of Edouard Balladur that an agreement on agricultural trade reached between the European Community and the United States last November must be renegotiated.
The agreement, named the Blair House accord after the Washington building in which it was negotiated, calls for a 21 percent cut over six years in the volume of subsidized grain and other food exports from the European Community and for a cut in the amount of land in the community used for oilseed production. It also contains a so-called peace clause, stipulating that the United States and the European Community must refrain from action against each other on farm-trade questions for six years.
At the time it was reached, the agreement was hailed by the United States and many European officials as a decisive breakthrough in the long-stalled world trade talks known as the Uruguay Round. These negotiations began in Uruguay in 1986 and world leaders have promised repeatedly, most recently at the economic summit meeting in Tokyo in July, to conclude them rapidly.
But arguments over liberalizing agricultural trade, which accounts for about 9.5 percent of international commerce and has traditionally been a highly protected sector, have repeatedly blocked the talks.
President Clinton, in a meeting last week with Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi of Italy, stressed that there was no question of renegotiating the Blair House agreement.
Still, France, the second-largest agricultural exporter in the world after the United States, insisted on Monday that the Blair House accord was unacceptable. "We cannot hide the truth," Farm Minister Jean Puech declared. "A renegotiation is necessary."
French farmers, a vociferous lobby whose influence on French politics is considerable, have staged several protests against the Blair House accord over the last week.
France wants cuts in the community's subsidized food exports shifted to the end of the six-year period, guarantees that the community share in an anticipated expansion of the world food market in Asia and particularly China, a stipulation that the 21 percent cut be applied across the board and not product by product, and assurances that current large community stocks of food not be affected by the agreement.
Moreover, France wants the six-year peace clause expanded indefinitely so that the community has a cast-iron assurance that its agricultural policy will never again be contested by America.
The statement agreed upon by ministers today, after more than 12 hours of talks, contained no specific reference to the Blair House accord. But it said that the European Community Executive Commission, which negotiated the accord, should pursue negotiations with the United States with a view to "maintaining the community's vocation as a agricultural supporter" insuring that any General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade agreement does not force further changes of the community's agricultural policy.
Sir Leon Brittan, the community's chief trade negotiator, is scheduled to visit Washington on Sept. 26.
Community officials said the statement represented a compromise between the British insistence that there could be no renegotiation of the Blair House accord because this would effectively destroy the chances of a GATT agreement by Dec. 15, and the French insistence that changes must be made.
Alain Juppe, the French Foreign Minister, interpreted the statement to mean that the commission now had a mandate to wring concessions from the United States on extending the peace clause and on insuring that the proposed 21 percent cut in subsidized food exports is weakened.
But Mr. Hurd said the commission's talks in Washington would be purely exploratory. "Blair House will not be renegotiated," he declared.

HEADLINE: C. L. Sulzberger, Columnist, Dies at 80

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
C. L. Sulzberger, a prize-winning foreign correspondent and foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times for nearly 40 years and the author of two dozen books, most of them on foreign policy and world leaders in the cold-war era, died yesterday at his home in Paris. He was 80.
Mr. Sulzberger, who gave up his Op-Ed page column in The Times in 1978 but continued writing his memoirs and books on foreign affairs, died of natural causes after a long illness, his family said. 
 The son of Leo Sulzberger, he was a nephew of Arthur Hays Sulzberger, publisher of The Times from 1935 to 1961. He was also a first cousin of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the paper from 1963 to 1992 and still chairman of the Times Company.
In a career that began in the Great Depression and spanned World War II, the Korean and Vietnam Wars and the rise and fall of nations, Mr. Sulzberger roamed the world from his longtime base in Paris to interview historic leaders and to chronicle and analyze the major events of his time. His columns offered portraits of leaders and nations, opinions on foreign news and critiques of American foreign policy.
 
Career Spanned 5 Decades
 After graduation from Harvard and five years with other news organizations, Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times in 1939 and was its chief foreign correspondent from 1944 to 1954, when he became a columnist. His column, "Foreign Affairs," appeared three times a week, on the editorial page until 1970, then on the Op-Ed page until his retirement in 1978.
Mr. Sulzberger, who was banned from half a dozen countries for his reporting and won a special Pulitzer Prize citation in 1951, ranged over the field of foreign affairs, touching on military power, economics, diplomacy, industrial and agricultural production and especially the ideas and personalities of leaders.
As a reporter and commentator, he had the inestimable gift of a quick study: the ability to land in the morning in Moscow or Beijing, Prague or Johannesburg, and, with the benefit of speedy access to top leaders, to write by nightfall a cogent report giving the impression he had steeped himself in a subject all his life.
From presidents and Prime Ministers in their inner sanctums to royalty in palaces and rebels in mountain strongholds, he crisscrossed and circled the world to talk to and write with insight about Stalin, Nikita S. Khrushchev, Zhou Enlai, John F. Kennedy, Richard M. Nixon, Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle and many heads of government and state, ambassadors and foreign ministers, generals and secret agents.
 
Praise and Criticism
 His contacts with the famous and the mighty produced many notable exclusive articles, and he readily took credit for them. And while he was widely praised for his ability to uncover news and to comment upon it in a voice of wide experience and intelligence, some reviewers of his books an academic critics also said his views were pompous, debatable and laden with trivia.
Moreover, while he frequently challenged policy as formulated in Washington and other capitals, critics noted in retrospect that his reporting and commentary often tipped toward the official line of the leaders he covered -- that was, indeed, a general practice of diplomatic reporting in his era.
And he candidly acknowledged that his entree was enormously eased by his role as a Times correspondent and columnist, by his connections to the family that owned the newspaper and especially by the desire of leaders and revolutionaries to get maximum attention for their views through its widely read columns.
 
A Message for Kennedy
 At times, Mr. Sulzberger had behind-the-scenes roles in the affairs he wrote about. In "The Last of the Giants," a 1970 book about world leaders he had covered, he recalled that in a 1961 interview in Moscow, Khrushchev asked him to take a message to President Kennedy, and he did so. The contents were never revealed.
Mr. Sulzberger often injected himself into his accounts: "I limped goutily over to the Elysee -- for an appointment with President Pompidou," Henry Kissinger, "no slouch in the art of flattery, assured me that both he and the President thought my column was the best being written," or "I was sitting in the cold lobby of the Moskva Hotel this morning when John Foster Dulles came along, nudged me and suggested we go for a walk."
In 1977, Mr. Sulzberger was accused in an article in Rolling Stone magazine of having had a secret relationship for years with the Central Intelligence Agency. And a C.I.A. official charged that Mr. Sulzberger's Sept. 13, 1967, column on the Soviet K.G.B. had been lifted almost verbatim from an agency briefing paper.
There was no question that Mr. Sulzberger had extensive contacts with C.I.A. station chiefs and agents in many countries. And, it was pointed out, he would have been extremely useful to the agency with his access to foreign leaders and his influential voice in the pages of The Times.
The Times, after an extensive investigation, reported that the C.I.A. had counted a number of American journalists among its paid agents, but denied that Mr. Sulzberger had been among them. Mr. Sulzberger also denied that he ever worked for the C.I.A. or that he had used an agency briefing paper as a column.
 
A Good Listener
 A tall, bespectacled man with white hair and a thin smile that captured a blend of worldly wit and solemnity, Mr. Sulzberger was remembered by colleagues at The Times as convivial and generous, a raconteur who could be punditical at times but who also was a good listener and a good friend.
Close acquaintances, too, remembered him as a man who led a double life. There was a darker side to his personality, one that brooded in diaries about not having done more in life and that longed for the privacy of a fishing stream in the Colorado Rockies, where he went each summer, or his villa on the Greek island of Spetsai.
The darker side was illuminated in a 1980 book by Mr. Sulzberger, "How I Committed Suicide: A Reverie." In it, he spoke of profound loneliness after the death of his wife, the former Marina Tatiana Lada, in 1976. They had been married in 1942 and she had often accompanied him on his journeys and made their Paris home a salon for the illustrious and the powerful.
 
'The Keyes of My Prison'
 He also wrote of his departure from The Times, under a mandatory retirement program then in effect, and of the sense that he had outlived his era. And he declared: "How right Donne was, I thought, when he wrote, 'Mee thinks I have the keyes of my prison in mine owne hand, and no remedy presents it selfe so soone to my heart, as mine own sword' -- except it was mine own gun and not my sword."
Cyrus Leo Sulzberger was born in New York City on Oct. 27, 1912, and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard in 1934. While he wanted to go into journalism and had close family connections to The Times, he chose to start elsewhere to establish his name.
He started as a general assignment reporter for The Pittsburgh Press and a year later went to Washington for the United Press, covering labor, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve system. He later went to Europe and worked for The London Evening Standard and other newspapers and periodicals in the United States and Europe.
Joining The Times in 1939 as a young foreign correspondent at the outbreak of World War II, he traveled 100,000 miles through 30 countries in his first three years on the job, sending reports from the Balkans, North Africa, Italy, the Soviet Union, the Middle East and capitals and front lines across a war-torn Europe.
 
Arrest and Expulsion
 He wrote so many provocative articles about Balkan and Axis politics that he was successively banned from Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Italy. "A creeping tarantula, going from country to country, spreading poison," the Italian propagandist Virginio Gayda wrote of him. In 1941, he was arrested by the Gestapo in Slovakia and accused of being a British spy; he was later released without a trial.
As chief correspondent of The Times from 1944 to 1954, he directed the coverage of the end of the war in Europe with a distinguished group that included Drew Middleton, Raymond Daniell, Herbert L. Matthews, Clifton Daniel and James Reston.
After the war, Mr. Sulzberger chronicled the division of Europe into Western and Communist spheres, analyzed rival guerrilla movements in Yugoslavia and drew out for readers the complex character of Tito and won a special Pulitzer Prize citation in 1951 for an exclusive prison-cell interview in Yugoslavia with Archbishop Alojzije Stepinac, whose 1946 conviction on war-crimes charges signaled the start of the postwar struggle between church and state in Eastern Europe.
While he knew many world leaders on a first-name basis, he was perhaps most intimate with de Gaulle, the French statesman whose career and complex character filled scores of columns and many chapters of Mr. Sulzberger's books.
 
Books on Foreign Affairs
 Mr. Sulzberger's many books included "The Big Thaw," published in 1956, a personal exploration of the Soviet Union and its satellite countries in Eastern Europe under the Khrushchev regime; "What's Wrong With U.S. Foreign Policy," a 1959 critique; "A Long Row of Candles," a 1969 memoir; "The Fall of Eagles," a 1977 volume on the collapse of the Hapsburgs, the Hohenzollerns and the Romanovs, and "Seven Continents and Forty Years," a 1977 chronicle of Mr. Sulzberger's career.
Reviewers sometimes criticized Mr. Sulzberger's books for being repetitious, for injecting the author too much into accounts of conversations with interview subjects, and for too much trivia in the bulky volumes: what King Paul of Greece wore, and where Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower bought cheap clothing.
But more typically reviewers praised him for indefatigable reporting, for courage on dangerous assignments and for what Paul Grimes, reviewing "Seven Continents and Forty years," called his "sharp succinct portraits" of world leaders, and he listed a few: "She looks like a simple grandmother but she is obdurate and hard as nails," (Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel), and "a small, pipe-smoking man with an unctuous manner . . . the face of a halibut with shark's eyes." (Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Britain).
 
Decline of U.S. Power
 Theodore H. White, in a review of "What's Wrong With U.S. Foreign Policy," said Mr. Sulzberger had documented "in overwhelming and appalling detail," how the United States had lost power in the postwar years and the 1950's. "Mr. Sulzberger's unique opportunities as global investigator for The Times are buttressed by his knowledge of history," Mr. White declared.
Among Mr. Sulzberger's honors were Overseas Press Club awards for the best consistent reporting from abroad in 1951, and for excellence in reporting and writing in 1957 and 1970.
He is survived by a son, David Alexis Sulzberger, of London; a daughter, Marina Sulzberger Berry, of London, and two grandchildren. The family said the funeral would be private.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains Against Yen Ahead of Japanese Rate Cut

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday amid reports that the Bank of Japan was on the verge of cutting a key interest rate.
In Tokyo early today, the Japanese central bank formally announced that it was cutting its discount rate by 3/4 point. 
 Meanwhile, gold prices advanced. On the Commodity Exchange, gold for October delivery gained $2.70 an ounce, to $353.80.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 104.67 yen, from 104.50 yen on Friday, after drifting lower against the Japanese currency for most of the day. In early trading in Tokyo today, the dollar slipped slightly, falling back to 104.50 yen by late morning.
 
 
A SurpriseNews Agencies' Reports'People Are Convinced
 The dollar jumped after Japanese news agencies reported that the Bank of Japan would lower its discount rate to 1.75 percent from 2.5 percent, to keep the country's economy from slipping into recession. The reports surprised currency traders, who had been expecting only a half-point cut.
"People are convinced that the Japanese will cut rates," said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. He said traders sold yen to protect themselves from a larger-than-expected rate cut.
Lower interest rates make yen-denominated deposits less attractive, diminishing demand for the currency. A rate cut could also help convince the Clinton Administration that Japan is serious about spurring demand for American exports. That could defuse the trade tensions that sent the yen soaring against the dollar this year.
Traders have been expecting Japan to cut interest rates for weeks. Speculation built last week after the Government announced a $57 billion economic package that appeared to fall short of American expectations.
The Clinton Administration has been pressing Japan to increase its demand for American goods in order to curb a swelling trade surplus.
Investors sold dollars for yen just after the economic package was announced, based on the belief that disappointment with it would lead American Government officials to push for a higher yen as a way to curb the surplus. A stronger yen makes Japanese exports more expensive.
"Any indication that the U.S. will resume its calls for a stronger yen will drive the dollar back down to 101 yen very quickly," Keith Cheveralls, foreign exchange manager at Nippon Credit Bank, said. "The yen is the most politically sensitive currency in the universe right now."
President Clinton and his aides have occasionally endorsed the yen's strength this year, in which the dollar has tumbled as much as 20 percent against the Japanese currency.

HEADLINE: Stocks Plunge on Bond Market Weakness

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
The stock market took a deep dive yesterday amid weakness in the bond market and apprehension about the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average posted its sharpest daily decline since early April.
"We had a very bad bond market in the afternoon," David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, said. "On the stock market side, we have earnings worries. What I've been telling people is that a slow-growth economy is not an earnings-friendly economy."
 
 
Drop in the Afternoon
 After a morning spent basically flat, the Dow Jones industrials dropped steeply all afternoon to close at 3,575.80, down 37.45 points, or 1.04 percent. The Dow Jones transportations were down 4.70 points to close at 1,616.38, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 3.78 points, to 455.05. The American Stock Exchange composite index slipped 1.76 points, to 451.05, and the Nasdaq composite edged up slightly, by one-tenth of a point, to 740.21. 
 Volume was 231.1 million shares, which was not comparable to the 381.4 million shares traded during Friday's triple-witching frenzy, the highest volume on the Big Board since December 1992.
The bond market, which traders said was vulnerable now because of a lack of new significant economic data to give it guidance until Oct. 8, sold off in light trading. Traders spoke of reports of a large seller of 30-year Treasury bonds, profit taking and other factors that sent prices lower. The yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.09 percent, its highest level since Aug. 21.
"My sense is that we're in a correction right now," Mr. Shulman of Salomon said of the stock market. "I've been looking for this for a while and I've been wrong. Now, after being bearish and wrong, maybe I'll be bearish and right."
Ned Collins, executive vice president in charge of trading at Daiwa Securities America, said after the close of trading that he was "a little shellshocked."
In addition to the bond market, he said, there was extensive program selling in the afternoon and also some repercussions from the "triple witching" selling of Friday, when three sets of options and futures contracts expired simultaneously. Many of the big firms that closed out contracts came back yesterday morning and took another look at their positions, he said, adding, "It's a very nervous market."
Mr. Collins also said market lore was playing a role in the selling, with a "three-year theory" making its way around Wall Street based on the observation that the market had rough Octobers in 1981, 1984, 1987 and 1990.
"A lot of people are expecting that the same thing will take place this October," he said. "People are saying, 'Let's get out before the bad stuff starts.' "
Mr. Collins anticipates more selling. "I just think that there are too many people that are anticipating this huge correction," he said. "Markets sometimes don't do what we want them to do when we want to do it."
 
 
Blue Chips Hit
 Blue-chip and cyclical stocks were among the biggest decliners. Alcoa was down 2 3/4, to 68 3/4; General Electric fell 3/4, to 97 1/4; Triple M slid 1 3/4, to 106; ITT was down 1 7/8, to 90 3/4, and International Paper dropped 1 1/2, to 61 3/8.
Among technology and related stocks, the story was mixed but negative on balance. Hewlett-Packard was down 2 7/8, to 65; I.B.M. slipped 1 1/8, to 42 1/4, and Compaq lost 1 7/8, to 55 3/4. Intel closed up 7/8, at 65 1/8; Oracle was up 2, to 54 5/8, on a "buy" recommendation from an analyst, and Novell was up 3/4, to 19 3/4. Microsoft declined 3/8, to 75 5/8.
The Paramount-Viacom merger and its attendant news continued to send ripples throug5h the market. The only gainer was Paramount, which closed up 1 1/4, at 69 3/4, after QVC Network said it would top Viacom's offer for Paramount. Others were down, with Viacom closing 5/8 lower, at 59 1/4, and QVC down 3 1/2, to 56.
Buenos Aires Embotelladora S.A., an Argentine soft-drink company, saw its American depository receipts rise 2 3/4 to close at 31 3/8, after it joined with Pepsi-Cola to form a bottling venture. Nike, the shoe maker, was down 1 3/4, to 46 1/4, on a prediction of weaker earnings.
Molten Metal closed up 2 1/2, at 25 1/4, after the company said it had received patent approval from Massachusetts for a recycling research and development facility.
Digital Communications Associates, a maker of data communications equipment, said it was considering an offer to sell the company. The stock closed up 3 1/2, at 17 1/8.

HEADLINE: CUBAN PILOT SAYS MILITARY HAS WOES

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 20

 BODY:
A Cuban Air Force pilot who on Friday defected to the United States said today that the country's economic crisis under Fidel Castro had now grown so severe that the nation's military elite and its equipment, morale and readiness were being hurt.
In an interview and a news conference here, Capt. Enio Ravelo Rodriguez said that one concern that led him to fly a MIG-21 jet trainer to Key West, Fla., from an air base just outside Havana was his fear of a popular revolt in which he would be called upon to fight against his people. Many colleagues, he said, share that same anxiety and are wrestling with their consciences. 
 "It is my belief that no pilot would be capable of taking any action against the Cuban people," Mr. Ravelo said. He described his 13-minute dash across the Florida Straits as "a journey from oppression to liberty."
Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, which deprived the Cuban economy of up to $5 billion a year in subsidies, living conditions on the island have become increasingly austere and difficult. With food, fuel and medicine in short supply, many Cubans spend hours each day foraging for basic necessities and are grumbling with growing boldness about Mr. Castro's 34-year dictatorship.
 
'Barely Enough'
 To reduce those economic and political pressures, Mr. Castro recently announced that Cuban citizens would be allowed to have dollars and use them to buy goods at special stores. But Mr. Ravelo said members of the military had not been included in the decree and were being forced to live in circumstances worse than average citizens with access to dollars.
"We are now the oppressed," he said of Cuba's military, which long enjoyed special privileges as a reward for its role as "guardians of the Cuban Revolution." He said that in his own case the food supplied to his family was "barely enough to maintain them."
Mr. Ravelo, 32, described himself as a veteran of Cuba's war in Angola and said he had twice attended pilot training schools in the former Soviet Union, from 1981 through 1984, and then again in 1987. He left behind his 27-year-old wife, Elisa, and a 2-year-old daughter, Elisa Aura, but he said he hoped they would be allowed to join him in the United States.
He also said that worsening economic conditions had led to a sharp decline in military maintenance standards, since the government could no longer afford to spend the money to keep equipment in top fighting condition. He said that the MIG-21 he had taken on a routine training mission when he flew to the United States was one of many air force planes in that precarious state.
"The level of safety is horrible," he said. But he added that in the event of a military confrontation with the United States, the Cuban Air Force's best planes, the MIG-29, would be ready for combat.

HEADLINE: Japan Cuts Discount Rate 3/4 Point to 1 3/4%

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Sept. 21

 BODY:
In an unexpectedly aggressive move, the Bank of Japan this morning cut its official discount rate 3/4 point to the lowest level in history, 1 3/4 percent.
The central bank said it made the decision, which was formally announced before the financial markets opened here, because Japan's slumping economy "is still in a stagnant state." The bank had been expected to cut the rate this month, but only 1/2 point. 
 This is the seventh time the discount rate has been cut since July 1991, when Japan started slipping into recession. By contrast, the discount rate is 3 percent in the United States and 6 1/4 percent in Germany.
Japan's Government has been under severe pressure from the nation's business community to take action to stimulate the economy. The United States has also been pushing Japan to take pump-priming measures to help the world economy and to increase imports to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus.
The pressure intensified in the last two weeks as a survey by the Bank of Japan showed that business sentiment had fallen to its lowest level in nearly two decades and as the Government reported that Japan's gross national product had contracted by an annual rate of 2 percent in the quarter ended in June.
Still, cutting the discount rate, which is the interest level charged by the central bank when it lends money to commercial banks, is likely to have only a moderate effect in bringing about an economic recovery. Theoretically, with interest rates at unprecedented low levels, businesses will borrow more money to invest. Capital spending by businesses has been on a long decline.
But many Japanese companies, including automobile, steel and electric appliance makers, are being hurt by excess production capacity and might not need to borrow money anyway.
"It's not going to spur investment very much because there's too much excess capacity already," said Robert Alan Feldman, director of economic research for Salomon Brothers in Tokyo. He said, however, that the discount rate cut would help the economy somewhat by saving companies money on interest expenses, giving them more money to spend on wages.
The cut in the discount rate should spur commercial banks to lower their short-term prime rates by another 1/2 point from their current levels of 3 3/4 percent, Mr. Feldman said.
Paul A. Summerville, director of Asian research for Lehman Brothers, said that the central bank still had room to make another rate cut early next year. That is becuase inflation is low and downward pressure is being exerted on prices by the rise of the Japanese yen against the dollar, which makes oil and other imported products less expensive for the Japanese.
Last week, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced Japan's third emergency economic stimulus package in 13 months. The new effort consists of about $57 billion of increased public spending, business incentives and low-interest loans for housing.

HEADLINE: Clinton Pesticide Plan Would Cut Use

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 20

 BODY:
After decades of scientific disputes and political strife over the safety of pesticides, the Clinton Administration will ask Congress to reduce sharply the amount of toxic chemicals used in American agriculture, forestry and other industries.
The Administration's plan, which was put together by three Federal agencies and will be proposed to Congress on Tuesday, calls for the Government to change the fundamental basis of it regulation of toxic chemicals used to kill weeds and insects and stop plant diseases. 
 Federal law requires that the potential risks of pesticides to health and the environment must be weighed against the economic benefits of their use. And until now, the Government tended to give more weight to economic arguments and data, generally putting the protection of crops and farmers' incomes ahead of public health.
 
Changing Standards of Proof
 The Clinton Administration's plan, parts of which were made available by Administration officials, calls for the Government to begin reversing that tendency and putting the safety of consumers first. Administration officials said that change would come about by lowering the standards of legal and scientific proof that must be used to demonstrate that a pesticide poses ahazard.
The plan also appears destined to put the Clinton Administration into a head-on confrontation with some influential political groups, including environmental advocates, the chemical industry, farmers and timber companies.
In part to build support among those groups, the Administration is also proposing to relax another pesticide rule, the Delaney Clause of the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. The Delaney Clause outlaws any pesticides that have concentrated in processed foods and have also been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals.
Last year, environmentalists won a court decision requiring the Government to interpret the law strictly and begin removing dozens of pesticides from the market.
 
A Major Departure
 The net effect of both moves, if approved, would be to control the use of pesticides more stringently as they are applied, with the goal that such rules would sufficiently limit the concentrations of pesticides that could eventually appear in food and water. Such an approach is a departure from the thinking that has shaped policy since chemical pesticides came to be widely used in agriculture and forestry in the late 1940's. To put that change into effect would require the Administration to win the votes in Congress to amend the two Federal laws regulating pesticides, as well as taking a number of administrative actions.
A senior Administration official called the plan "the best attempt in 20 years for a breakthrough on food safety reform." The official added, "We undoubtedly will take some flak from various interest groups but we plan to prevail because of the pressing need to overhaul an antiquated system."
Jay Vroom, the president of the National Agricultural Chemicals Association, a Washington-based group that represents the pesticide industry, which has $6 billion a year in sales, said he was nervous about the plans for more easily removing pesticides from the market. "But that may be the price we pay for getting what we want, which is a change in the Delaney Clause," he said.
Jay Feldman, the executive director of the National Coalition Against the Misuse of Pesticides, an environmental group, said conservationists would generally support the Administration's goal of reducing the amount of pesticides applied to the land. But environmentalists are also adamantly opposed to any change in the Delaney Clause and are likely to press for new provisions to encourage farm and forestry practices that do not use pesticides.
"You can congratulate the Administration for taking on an issue that is extremely controversial," Mr. Feldman said. "But you can fault them for failing to establish a system that questions the need for using pesticides altogether."
 
Added Risk to Children
 The Administration's plan comes three months after the National Academy of Sciences published a study saying that children may be at risk from exposure to trace levels of pesticides found not only in foods but also in products used in lawn care, restaurants and schools as well as in household bug killers.
The Environmental Protection Agency and the National Agricultural Chemicals Association say that between 800 million and 1 billion pounds of some 600 pesticide ingredients are used each year. Roughly 300 pesticides are applied to the land to protect much of the nation's grain, vegetable and fruit crops. The other 300 are used in industry, forestry, lawn care and the like.
The Clinton Administration's plan is largely a collection of proposals that the interest groups, Congress, the National Academy of Sciences and several previous administrations have discussed over the last decade.
The Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency cooperated in putting the package together, which is largely directed toward amending the Federal Insecticide Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the nation's pesticide control law.
 
Uncertainty and Money
 The centerpiece of the law is a provision that requires the Government to prove that a pesticide poses "an unreasonable adverse affect" on health or the environment before it can be removed from the market. The Government also must weigh that unreasonable affect against the economic benefits pesticides have for both farmers and consumers.
Because such a finding is fraught with both scientific uncertainties and important political and financial consequences, the Government has taken action to remove pesticides from the market only a handful of times in the last two decades.
The Clinton Administration proposes to reduce the levels of proof needed to show a pesticide is dangerous and to change the legal procedures for banning compounds. For instance, the law requires that if a chemical company protests, the Government put its case before an administrative law judge before it can remove a chemical, a procedure that has taken as long as four years.
The Clinton Administration's plan would eliminate that requirement and allow the Government to remove or restrict chemicals through administrative decisions.
 
Program to Cut Use
 The plan also calls for broader research and education programs to encourage farmers to cut in half the amount of pesticides used on roughly 300 million acres of cropland. The Administration said it hoped to meet that goal by the end of the decade.
Under the plan, the E.P.A. is given the principal responsibility for establishing new procedures for setting safety limits for pesticides in food. Such limits would be set up to protect children, taking into consideration the National Academy of Sciences finding that children are especially vulnerable to exposures to pesticides. The current safety standards are outmoded and largely designed to protect adults.
All three agencies are to cooperate in designing a new study of the nation's eating habits to determine which foods may pose the greatest risk.
And the Food and Drug Administration would be given more authority to seize foods found to have pesticides exceeding Federal safety standards.

Bond Rally Appears to Near End

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market gave its strongest signal to date yesterday that the rally that pushed yields to their lowest level in 25 years could be over.
The price of the 30-year bond dropped 24/32 of a point. And its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 6.09 percent, its highest level since Aug. 21, and up from 6.04 on Friday. 
 Since prices dropped sharply last Tuesday after a disappointing increase in August consumer prices, the yield on the 30-year bond has jumped almost a quarter of a percentage point from a 25-year low of 5.86 percent. Yields on Treasury notes, from 10 years to 2 years, also rose as their prices declined.
The selloff in the bond market spread quickly to the stock market, driving down the Dow Jones industrial average 37.45 points, to 3,575.80, the steepest one-day drop since early April. [Page D8.]
 
 
No Resiliency
 There was no resiliency in the bond market yesterday as there was last week. Although prices moved down and yields rose after Tuesday's report of a three-tenths of 1 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index, the market seemed able to bounce back each day after sharp price drops in the morning.
But while these and other signals are raising doubts about the future of the bond market rally, some analysts and traders are not ready to say it is over. They note that trading yesterday was very light, making big swings in the market likely. They pointed to the report of one large seller of 30-year bonds. They talked of profit taking and technical selling connected to the 30-year bond future contract and to the fact that the Treasury is auctioning $16 billion of two-year notes today and $11 billion of five-year notes tomorrow.
Ronald Connors, the Government trading manager at Bear, Stearns & Company, put his conflicting feelings on the market this way: First, he said: "I am not saying the bull market is coming to an end; it is still too early too tell that. It is still in a corrective phase."
Then, he added: "I am predisposed to being bearish on the market. There is so much good news in the market that it is subject to a reversal here."
Alan Levenson, a money market economist at UBS Securities, agreed with Mr. Connors that it would take new reports of economic weakness and low inflation to prompt new buying. "If the rally is not over, it will need fresh news to pick up steam again," he said. But the September employment report will not be released until Oct. 8, with the inflation data coming out the next week, leaving the market little direction until then.
At the same time, Mr. Levenson said that because longer-term interest rates were still significantly higher than short-term rates, there would be plenty of portfolio managers and individual investors who would want to buy longer-term securities to get higher yields, and this should give some support to prices.
David Ader, an analyst at Technical Data in Boston, said the results of his survey of portfolio managers every two weeks made him feel a little more confident about the market outlook.
He said that managers indicated that they took the bond market's sell-off over the last week as as a positive correction after a strong rally without any real pause. And they indicated that with prices at their current levels, they were likely to use the cash on hand to buy Treasury notes and securities on further declines.
 
 
Portuguese Notes
 The rush of foreigners into the American market to raise money at low interest rates continued yesterday, with a $1 billion sale of 10-year notes by the Government of Portugal.
The sale is a global issue, which means it is sold simultaneously in the United States, Europe and Asia and can be traded in any of those markets.
The deal comes on the heals of a $3.5 billion sale last week of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds by Italy, as more European countries move to raise money in international markets. The sales were both firsts for Italy and Portugal.
Companies are also taking this route, as shown by the $27.7 billion in corporate bonds sold so far this year, according to Securities Data Company. The total so far this year is just below the $28.3 billion for all of last year and is greater than the sales in 1991 and 1990.
Manuel A. Pinho, the Director General of the Treasury of Portugal, said that the Government was doing a global issue to widen the investor base for Portugal and to "raise our profile in international markets."
Several investors at the road show presentations the Government did, he said, knew almost nothing about Portugal. He said that one money manager told him after after a presentation, "I thought Portugal was only a country of golf course and vinho verde," a light white wine with a slight sparkle.
The 10-year notes were priced to yield 5.83 percent, which is 45 basis points over the yield on the 10-year Treasury note at the time of the sale. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
While Portugal has a credit rating just slightly below that of Italy, the spread over the rate on the 10-year Treasury note was much narrower, a probable reflection of the severe political and economic difficulties in Italy. At the time of the sale last week, the Italian 10-year notes had a yield of 6.02 percent, 60 basis points over the yield on the 10-year Treasury note.
The spread was also lower than that on the other major global issues by European governments this year, including Sweden.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Plan Offered By Giuliani On Hospitals

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Citing efforts to scale back government in cities and states across the country, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, proposed yesterday that the city shift control of as many as four municipal hospitals to nonprofit groups.
In a breakfast speech to a forum of business groups, he also said Kennedy International Airport should be turned over to private concerns. 
 His suggestions, part of a speech on fiscal policy, came on a day when Mr. Giuliani and Mayor David N. Dinkins sparred over the state of the city's economy and how to stem the loss of more than 350,000 private-sector jobs over the last five years. Later in the morning, Mr. Giuliani was endorsed by the 2,000-member union representing housing police officers, which supported Mr. Dinkins in 1989.
The Mayor, trying to highlight his own proposal to help create 110,000 jobs over a second term, went to West 47th Street in the diamond district yesterday to announce creation of a public corporation to help the jewelry industry with job training, improved security and expanded exporting.
 
Scaling Back Government
 Mr. Giuliani reiterated proposals to reduce the size of the city government through attrition and a 10 percent cut in the staff of the mayor and the comptroller, to encourage a state takeover of some city services and to reduce certain taxes.
He also suggested that the city experiment with privatization. Although Mr. Giuliani's running mate for comptroller, Herman Badillo, has called for all 11 of the acute-care hospitals under the jurisdiction of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation to be privatized, Mr. Giuliani offered a more cautious approach.
"You can't privatize all of them all at once," he said. "It wouldn't be realistic. There wouldn't be a buyer around. It probably wouldn't make sense." But he said two to four hospitals could be put under the control of nonprofit groups.
"It will give confidence that that can be done without people having their lives changed," he said.
He predicted that the experiment would save money and "deliver considerably better and more humane services." William J. Grinker, an adviser to Mr. Giuliani, said more details of the hospital proposal would be released in a health policy paper.
Privatization of city hospitals and airports has been explored, but not put into effect by various city and state officials before. But complications as well as policy questions arise, such as the fact that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has a lease for the city's airports through the year 2015.
 
'Like Selling Yellowstone'
 Leland T. Jones, Mr. Dinkins's press secretary, said the revenues raised for the city by hospital sales would be minimal because the city would still have to pay its share of Medicaid costs. He added that privatization of health-care centers also raised questions of access. "It's like selling Yellowstone National Park," he said. "Right now it's open to anyone who can get there. If you sell Yellowstone -- a traditional Republican proposal -- it may be open to only those who can pay."
Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Dinkins also sparred over Mr. Giuliani's comment to the business forum that he had learned from President George Bush's mistakes and would not pledge never to raise taxes. "You're not going to hear me say, 'Read my lips,' because I don't know and you don't know what we face," he said.
In the diamond district, Mr. Dinkins said: "'He should take a George Bush approach. All the rest of his approaches are George Bush-like."
The Mayor, in remarks before about 40 industry officials at the Diamond Dealers Club, repeatedly called attention to the importance of the diamond and jewelry industries to New York's economy.
 
Lighting and Security
 But the actual commitment of city money to help the industries was modest. The Mayor said the city would contribute $35,000 to help set up the development corporation. The Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, also set aside $780,000 in the city's capital budget last June to repair West 47th Street and provide improved lighting and security.
Mr. Dinkins was joined at the meeting with industry leaders by Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who lauded Mr. Dinkins, calling him at one point "the finest Mayor that any city in America has ever had."
But while talking generally about the Clinton Administration's commitment to New York City, Mr. Brown offered no concrete Federal help for the jewelry industry.

HEADLINE: A Sluggish Forecast by Economists

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 20

 BODY:
Finding little evidence that tumbling interest rates are about to perk up a lackluster economy, a panel of business economists predicted today that growth would edge up to 2.7 percent next year from an expected 2.3 percent in 1993, too little to dent the current unemployment rate of 6.7 percent.
"I think you can describe it as slow growth as far as the eye can see," said William C. Dunkelberg, vice president of the National Association of Business Economists, presenting the group's forecast at its annual meeting, which began here today. 
 The 41 economists on the association's panel also contended after examining housing, capital investment and other interest-rate-sensitive sectors that rates had been falling because the financial markets expected a continued weak economy -- not because "lower interest rates will make a weak economy strong."
Today's forecast was even lower than that predicted by the preceding survey in May, in which 1993 growth, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, was projected at 2.8 percent and 1994 growth at 3 percent.
One reason for the relative pessimism among the business economists was that they believed the recently enacted Federal budget plan would achieve savings through 1998 of $125 billion, just a quarter of the $500 billion expected by the Administration.
When Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's top economic adviser, was asked about this after delivering a luncheon address, she declared that it was impossible to determine what contribution the budget deal had made to lowering rates or even to prove that its more important effect would be to cut the Government's demand for money rather than to slow the economy.
But repeating earlier assertions, Ms. Tyson said, "The best counter-argument to that is the strength of the stock market," which has hit new highs in recent weeks before retreating somewhat of late.
 
Defends Trade Pact
 In her address, Ms. Tyson made a strenuous defense of the pending expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement to Mexico, noting that two dozen studies of the accord had predicted that it would mean a net growth in jobs. She asserted that the liberalization of Mexican policy in the last seven years had already helped transform an American trade deficit into a surplus and had tripled United States exports to Mexico, with benefits to a wide range of industries.
She also said the job losses among American workers under the accord would be "very small," at most 200,000 over 10 years.
At a morning presentation, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Robert T. Parry, disputed commonly offered assessments of the nation's trade situation and assertions that the trade deficit, which he characterized as not necessarily bad, was a meaningful gauge of American competitiveness.
"I do not think the trade deficit is due to lower wages, superior technology and unfair trade practices abroad," Mr. Parry said. "On the contrary, I think we can find the sources of the trade deficit in certain macroeconomic fundamentals -- namely our own Government budget deficit and our investment and savings patterns."
On other subjects, Ms. Tyson said a plan disclosed by the Concord Coalition today to eliminate the budget deficit entirely was a "draconian" threat to economic growth. The group was founded last year by Peter G. Peterson, a former Commerce Secretary who is chairman of the Blackstone Group, and former Senators Paul E. Tsongas and Warren B. Rudman to prod politicians to address the Federal budget deficit head on.
And after her news conference, Ms. Tyson said she did not know of any decision that the Administration had made on the size of taxes on tobacco or alcohol that are expected to be part of its health care program that will be announced on Wednesday night.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Sees Free-Trade Boon

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill.

 BODY:
As the showdown nears in Washington over the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement, it is no surprise that Caterpillar Inc. has been one of the strongest corporate voices in favor of the treaty.
From its base in this small city in central Illinois, Caterpillar has grown into the largest construction equipment maker in the world. It derives more than half its sales from exports. And it has a reputation as a company that has never seen a free trade proposal it didn't like. 
 The executives of Caterpillar sound like much of corporate America when they confidently echo the Government's claims about how beneficial Nafta could be for the American economy. But they are even more enthusiastic when talking about how Caterpillar stands to benefit.
In all, Caterpillar estimates that Nafta could help it sell an additional 350 pieces of equipment like bulldozers, tractors, and backhoes in Mexico each year. That would add $45 million a year to its Mexican revenues, on top of the $200 million that it already books. (Caterpillar reported $10.2 billion in total revenues last year)
That sales increase would be accomplished in two ways. First, Caterpillar is counting on Nafta to stimulate the Mexican economy, which in turn should lift the demand for all construction equipment, expanding one of Caterpillar's fastest-growing markets even more. "Mexico needs infrastructure and that plays to our strength," said Timothy L. Elder, the director of government affairs for Caterpillar.
In addition, rolling back the Mexican tariffs on American goods should allow Caterpillar to expand its market share in Mexico at the expense of Komatsu Ltd., and other Asian and European importers who will still be subject to Mexican tariffs.
Caterpillar said its exports to Mexico translates into jobs for 1,300 of its employees and 2,700 jobs for suppliers. But the company's executives conceded that actual employment levels reflected a wide range of operating concerns and could not be pinpointed with any specificity to the level or mix of sales to Mexico.
Over the long term, Caterpillar hopes Nafta will serve as a harbinger of lower trade barriers throughout Latin America. But the shorter term advantages alone are enough to convince the company that its interests are best served by the trade pact.
As things stand now, Caterpillar tractors and bulldozers built across the Illinois River from here in East Peoria face a 10 percent tariff going into Mexico. The company's marine engines, manufactured a few miles up the river in Mossville, Ill., must overcome a 15 percent tariff barrier, and its excavators, built outside Chicago in Aurora, Ill., face a 20 percent tariff. Nafta would eliminate all those barriers immediately and phase out similar duties on other Caterpillar products in five to 10 years.
 
More Flexibility
 Without those tariffs artificially inflating prices, Caterpillar said it would have the flexibility to either roll back prices to build market share or keep prices where they were and enjoy fatter profit margins. Caterpillar executives said the decisions about whether to use its Nafta-based cost advantage to expand the margins or to cut prices would be made on a product-by-product basis.
Either way, Donald Fites, the chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar, said he believed some Mexican customers were hoping the big equipment maker chose the former route. They have held back orders on the hope that Nafta would pass, allowing Caterpillar to give them a price break.
Even without Nafta, sales of Caterpillar products to Mexico have surged since the Salinas Government began reducing tariffs and easing spending restrictions that had been imposed in the early 1980's to reduce the debt burden in Mexico. Caterpillar sold just 11 machines to Mexico in 1983. Last year the total had jumped to 1,200.
 
Loss of Confidence
 But if Nafta is defeated, the prospects for Caterpillar in Mexico are much less certain. "If Nafta fails to pass, I would expect the growth to slow if not go the other way," said Mr. Elder, explaining that the setback might cause some to lose confidence in the Mexican economy.
Something Nafta will not do, Caterpillar executives said, is send American jobs to Mexico. To be sure, the treaty would also eliminate American tariffs ranging from 2.5 percent to 4 percent on construction equipment made in Mexico, making manufacturing south of the border for export to the United States slightly cheaper than it is now. But Caterpillar argues that the elimination of the far higher tariffs on exports to Mexico tilts the playing field further toward manufacturing its equipment in the United States.
"If we had an incentive to move there, it would have been exercised already," Mr. Elder said.
 
Strained Union Relations
 In fact, Caterpillar set up a manufacturing plant near Monterrey, Mexico, in the early 1980's when Mexican import restrictions cut off most exports from Illinois. Employment there has actually declined to 1,200 workers from 1,700 as Mexico relaxed the restrictions. But a good portion of the decline was related to the transfer last year of the company's forklift operations to a venture with Mitsubishi rather than the greater efficiency of American production, Mr. Elder said.
No amount of reassurance or lobbying is likely to generate support for the treaty among Caterpillar's unionized work force, which is represented by the United Automobile Workers. The U.A.W., like other unions, said it believed the treaty would accelerate the flow of jobs from the United States to Mexico and be used by management as another hammer in bargaining over wages and benefits in this country. Caterpillar's relations with the union have been particularly strained since the two sides failed to settle on a new contract last year and Caterpillar forced workers to call off a strike and return to work on its terms.
 
Half-Hearted Effort
 "This is as much of a threat to a Caterpillar worker as any other," said James B. O'Conner, a U.A.W. official at Caterpillar. "It's just not going to happen here over night."
Caterpillar has distributed some materials attempting to win support among the workers for Nafta, but the effort has been half-hearted. Company officials said the workers who supported its position were scared into silence by the union's outspoken opposition. Caterpillar has campaigned to drum up support among other employees, suppliers and customers, and the 252-member Nafta Illinois coalition.
A telling indication of the size of the gulf with the production workers came when Mr. Elders was asked whether the side provisions on environmental and other issues in the pact might contain language that could offset many of the financial benefits Caterpillar saw in Nafta.
"We haven't had a good chance to analyze the side agreements yet but the reassuring thing is that organized labor says they are horrible," Mr. Elder said.
 
'Symmetrical Exaggerations'
 In truth, there is no simple way to separate the potential gains and losses that might stem from Nafta from larger issues like the huge gap in wage rates that already exists between the United States and Mexico. That gap has already induced American companies to move hundreds of thousands of jobs south of the border and will continue to attract them whether or not Nafta passes.
"There are symmetrical exaggerations from both sides," said Thea Lee, an economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a research center in Washington that has been generally critical of Nafta. "The Administration talks only about the new jobs related to exports without taking into account those displace by imports. But Ross Perot talks only about the latter."

HEADLINE: Despite Support of Pact, An Uncertainty Lingers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Caterpillar is unusual among the corporate supporters of Nafta in its willingness to put a dollar estimate on the gains it expects.
Other corporate executives also support Nafta by an overwhelming margin, even though they are hard-pressed to project with any confidence what will happen. 
 Most endorse the general premise that Nafta will stimulate Mexico's economy enough to help the United States, that it will help the United States become more competitive in Latin America, and could spur acceptance in Europe and Japan of other free trade agreements that would boost American exports.
That consensus is one reason that a recent survey, conducted by Caterpillar's engine division, of top shipping and logistics executives at the 500 largest companies, found three of four assumed Nafta would lead to economic growth that would expand trucking and other distribution activities. A similar proportion, however, were unsure of how their own companies would be affected.
 
A Small Market
 Much of the haziness about the value of Nafta is because Mexico, a country with an economy about the size of the Chicago-Milwaukee region, is still a relatively small market for American manufacturers.
However uncertain the benefits, by the time the negotiators finished with the 2,000-page text last year, few industries faced risks large enough to create strong opposition among executives.
The textile industry, for instance, is in danger of losing some of its production to Mexico under Nafta. And yet many leading textile and apparel manufacturers now favor the treaty. They expect Asian textile companies, with which Mexico will compete for the lower end of the market, to be even bigger losers. Meanwhile the prospects for sending American textiles and raw materials into Mexico could improve sharply.
"We would not be supporting the agreement if we thought that it would jeopardize our investment here," said Ronald J. Sorini, the senior vice president for international development at Fruit of the Loom Inc. The apparel maker, based in Chicago, has more than 30,000 employees in the Southeastern United States and spent more than $250 million to upgrade domestic production last year.
 
Divided Views
 The appliance industry shows how the wording of specific provisions has divided views about the pact. Maytag, Amana, and Frigidaire are among the appliance makers that object to the phased removal of the 20 percent Mexican appliance tariff over a 10-year period, especially since the 2.8 percent to 5.1 percent American tariffs are eliminated immediately.
The companies say it unfairly rewards rivals like General Electric and Whirlpool for their big investments in joint ventures with Mexican appliance companies.
"We are being penalized by Nafta for having invested in the United States," said Douglass Horstmann, the director for government affairs for Maytag. G.E., for its part, said it supported the immediate removal of all tariffs but was only a minority partner in the Mexican venture and did not control its lobbying.
Whirlpool said it supported the phased reduction of the Mexican tariffs to prevent the Mexican industry from being wiped out by American competition.

First-Quarter Nike Income Declined 7%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

 BODY:
For all their help hawking shoes and athletic gear for Nike Inc., Michael Jordan, Andre Agassi and other celebrities were powerless against unfavorable currency exchange rates, sluggish European economies and changes in United States tax laws.
Because of those factors, the athletic apparel company said yesterday, earnings for the first quarter fell 7 percent, to $114.1 million, or $1.49 a share, compared with the corresponding period last year. 
 Company officials said the decline was likely to continue, and that there would be layoffs to cut expenses.
The news hurt Nike stock, which fell $1.75 to close at a 52-week low of $46.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
In discussing the company's performance during an hourlong telephone conference and in a statement issued from his Beaverton, Ore., office, Nike's chairman, Philip H. Knight, painted a gloomy picture for the fiscal quarters ahead.
"Because of these variables and because continued caution by U.S. retailers and sluggish international economies have caused future orders for the next five months to total less than last year, we now believe earnings for fiscal 1994 will not match the record sales and income reported in fiscal 1993," he said in the statement.
While revenues for the quarter improved 1 percent, to $1.1 billion, a company record, sales were off internationally, the company's key growth area. Nike said that footwear sales outside the United States fell by 10 percent and apparel sales fell by 13 percent.
Further, worldwide orders for both categories scheduled for delivery between now and January were 4 percent lower than they were for the corresponding period last year.
The company said that if exchange rates for the dollar had remained constant over the year, the decrease would have been only 1 percent.
Company officials also told analysts that domestic orders for the next quarter were off by 10 percent, "a stunning figure," said Willard Brown of Dean Witter in Boston. "There was no way I could have forecast that," he said. "I thought they would have had flat sales. They got creamed."
The company said the earnings also reflected the 1 percent increase in corporate tax, retroactive to Jan. 1, passed by Congress last month as part of the deficit reduction package, and a one-time accounting charge.
In an attempt to stem some of the downward trends, Mr. Knight told shareholders at the annual meeting yesterday that the company would lay off up to 4 percent of its 10,000 workers worldwide. In so doing, he said, the company could cut expenses by $50 million for the rest of the current fiscal year, which ends May 31, 1994.

HEADLINE: Digital to Cut German Jobs

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: MUNICH, Germany, Sept. 20

 BODY:
The Digital Equipment Corporation's German unit said today that it would cut 1,300 jobs in 1994 in an apparent effort to slash expenses against a background of tumbling earnings.
In a statement, the unit, Digital Equipment Deutschland G.m.b.H., said about 21 percent of its 6,200-member work force would be eliminated. 
 Digital said in August that it would shut a plant in Kaufbeuren, Germany, to cut excess capacity, putting 600 people out of work. In the last year, Digital has announced the closing of a number of plants in the United States as well as a production site in Ireland.
The Digital-Kienzle Computersysteme unit, based in Villingen with 2,600 employees, will bear the brunt of the reductions, the statement said. Digital's operations at the German headquarters, which has 3,600 workers, will also be subject to some reductions. Digital has 94,200 employees worldwide, with 33,000 in Europe.

Oil Jumps as Cut in Output Is Expected at OPEC Talks

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Crude oil prices surged yesterday amid expectations that OPEC will cut production and that the unseasonably cool weather in the Northeast will lead to greater demand for heating oil.
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will gather on Saturday in Geneva to set fourth-quarter production levels and to discuss ways to push up the price of crude. Prices are near their lowest point in three years, and OPEC will be forced to limit production to keep them from falling further, traders said. 
 "Everyone's a little spooked" by OPEC and the coming meeting, said a trader with Pioneer Futures in New York. In the meantime, he said, prices "might go a little higher, but not much."
OPEC produces 37 percent of the world's oil. Overproduction by the group's members and slow economic growth have caused prices to fall recently.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for October delivery gained 63 cents to settle at $17.70 a barrel. October heating oil rose 1.81 cents, to 53.73 a gallon, and October unleaded gasoline rose 1.39 cents, to 50.27 cents a gallon. October natural gas gained 2.8 cents to settle $2.193 per million British thermal units.
Record low temperatures in New York City yesterday also helped push prices higher, as hopes rose that the winter would be cold and demand for heating oil would increase.
"It's a reminder, and people want to get started early," said Peter Leavitt, vice president of Weather Services Inc. in Bedford, Mass. To be sure, it's still too early to tell how cold winter will be, he said.
On other commodity markets, copper prices tumbled to their lowest level in six years after unusually strong demand for delivered copper in London eased suddenly on Friday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, copper for December delivery fell 1.6 cent, to 77.05 cents a pound.
Traders said heavy demand for copper in London had lifted prices above realistic levels, and when that demand eased, prices fell to reflect bulging stockpiles and slow economic growth.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
A campaign for Puerto Rico tries to redefine the island as more than a 'West Side Story' lyric.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
"WEST SIDE STORY" still has Puerto Rico's tourism officials asking a question posed in "The Sound of Music": "How do you solve a problem like Maria?"
The problem is that attitudes about Puerto Rico created by Maria, Bernardo, Anita and the rest of the characters from the stage musical and film versions of "West Side Story" continue to plague Puerto Rico, the tourism officials ruefully concede. 
 More than three decades after the Sharks rumbled and danced in iridescent outfits and stiletto heels, Stephen Sondheim's pointed lyrics still sting; for instance, "Puerto Rico, you ugly island, island of tropic diseases" and "Always the hurricanes blowing, always the population growing."
"There is that image Puerto Rico is 'West Side Story,' " said Manuel R. De Juan, deputy director of marketing and operations at the Puerto Rico Tourism Company, a Government-financed agency in San Juan responsible for marketing tourism. "We've found it in Germany, we've found it in Japan."
The objective, he added, is to replace negative perceptions with positive images of the island as "a place where you can have a world-class experience, whether on vacation, or to do business, or to live."
To that end, the tourism company is sharply increasing its annual advertising and public relations budget, to $20 million for 1993-94 from $13 million for 1992-93. And beginning this week, it is introducing a campaign created by its new agency that seeks to dispel old inaccurate impressions by creating a new inaccurate one.
The trick to the new campaign, by Marti, Flores, Prieto & Wachtel in San Juan, is that it relabels Puerto Rico a continent rather than an island. "Only a continent could offer so many great vacation experiences," the broadcast and print campaign asserts. "Only Puerto Rico puts it all within your reach."
"We want people to think of us as more than just another island" of beckoning beaches, said Steve Wachtel, president at Marti, Flores, who joined Mr. De Juan last week in New York to offer a preview of the campaign.
"Sun and sand are the table stakes for the Caribbean," he added. "You have that, or you're not in the game. But no one has ever communicated that idea of variety."
So the campaign ranges far beyond beaches into realms like nature ("the only tropical rain forest in the U.S. national forest system"), culture, heritage ("historic Old San Juan"), dining, shopping, scenery and sports.
"The Government is hellbent on making Puerto Rico one of the premier tourist destinations," Mr. De Juan said. "Part of our mandate is to make tourism a spearhead of economic growth."
"We want to double the contribution of tourism to our gross domestic product," he added, "from 6 percent to 12 percent. And doubling any business requires focusing single-mindedly."
Hence the campaign's conceit that Puerto Rico is not merely an island. If reclassifying an island as a continent sends geography teachers into paroxyms of indignation, so much the better; the clangorous outcry by grammarians against "Winston tastes good like a cigarette should" helped make that campaign one of the most talked about of the 1950's and 1960's.
"It's a way of shaking up people and saying 'Your perception is incorrect,' " Mr. Wachtel acknowledged. (Or as Mr. Sondheim wrote in a song for another musical, "Gypsy," "Ya gotta have a gimmick.")
The campaign by Marti, Flores, an affiliate of J. Walter Thompson, replaces long-running ads by Badillo/ Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in San Juan, the tourist company's previous agency, in which the actor Raul Julia called Puerto Rico "the shining star of the Caribbean."
"It was good at positioning us as a world-class destination," Mr. Wachtel said, "but didn't give us a specific personality." Mr. De Juan grumbled that in comparing Puerto Rico to Monaco, Scotland and other popular vacation spots, "we felt the ads said, 'The standard of quality is X, but you can also get it in Puerto Rico.' "
"Besides," he added, laughing, "they were mentioning my competition."
The Marti, Flores campaign will be introduced tomorrow at a promotional event in Times Square, as the commercials play on Sony Video One, the Jumbotron screen at One Times Square; they start running next Monday in 11 markets including Boston, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami and New York. On Friday, the campaign's print portion begins with a 10-page advertising insert in USA Today.
Among those invited to the promotional event are Mayor David N. Dinkins; Pedro Rosello, the Governor of Puerto Rico, and Chita Rivera -- who is, of course, not only the star of the Broadway musical "Kiss of the Spider Woman" but also the original Anita in "West Side Story."

A trade show challenges the runway A Ghost apart Tina Chow, the collector.

BYLINE: By Amy M. Spindler

 BODY:

A Challenger to the Runway
Runway shows may look like great theater to outsiders, but their validity is constantly being challenged. No one buys from the strobe-flashed catwalks anyway. The real business is done not from gilded chairs, but from folding ones, in trade shows and showrooms. 
 These days, the shows are more a photo opportunity and the mere raising of the curtain on another selling season.
Now, an upstart trade show is challenging even that idea. Some of Paris's avant-garde designers broke their collections in -- quel horreur -- New York this week.
Buyers got their first taste of the coming season on Sunday, when the New York Premier Collections show opened at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center two weeks before the spring ready-to-wear presentations are to begin in Milan.
The stew was thin, though. The most directional designers offered, generally, only bits and pieces of what they'll show for spring 1994. For some, it whetted the appetite. Others left with their stomachs rumbling.
The event, sponsored by Blenheim Fashion Shows Inc. and to end today, is an ambitious attempt to give buyers the jump on collections that have not yet been presented in the fashion capitals, and to give foreign designers a crack at American buyers who are not venturing overseas in the current economy.
For the forward-thinking, the show's timing presents several problems. Many boutiques still do not want to buy before seeing what style dictators in Europe propose. Designers risk being copied when exposing their ideas in advance of the runway season. And once buyers see a designer's wares at a trade show, the theater and surprise of a runway presentation are dulled considerably.
The American designer Kalinka, perched in her booth, said she had seen some new accounts. "Sales and shows are two different things, and sales come first," she said. "You show a touch of spring here, and then kill them on the runway."
Kenneth Richard was so unhappy about showing his hand this early that he pulled his collection from the trade show on Monday.
At least he turned up. Many of the most publicized participants were no-shows: Mark Eisen, Christian Francis Roth, Thierry Mugler, Robert Clergerie and Richard Tyler.
Retailers had mixed reactions. "I don't feel like we've gotten any guidance or direction here," said Bill Loya, who owns a boutique in Salt Lake City. "I expected more European designers with a great taste level, and I haven't found them."
But Maria Luisa Poumaillou, the owner of Maria Luisa, one of Europe's most directional stores, was upbeat about the show. She is considering opening a Maria Luisa shop in New York, and she saw some Americans in their studios: Todd Oldham, Byron Lars, Morgan Le Faye and Anna Sui. Ms. Poumaillou stashed seven Anna Sui flowered dresses in her luggage for her Rue Cambon boutique in Paris. "For me, Todd Oldham is great, because he was not at all concerned with this poor look everyone is doing," she said.
Ms. Poumaillou liked the early timing of New York Premier Collections. "After the French shows, there's not a single centime left," she said.
Marshall Lester, the chief executive of Blenheim's United States apparel division, said that he was satisfied with the show's first day and that he expected the event to evolve by next season. "Most Americans are still learning how to utilize a show like this," he said. "We're giving them something out of the ordinary."
 
Chance of a Ghost
 Ghost will be the lone London house on the New York runway schedule in October. But its designer, Tanya Sarne, is used to standing apart.
For 10 years, she's been making minimalistic dresses, when so many of her peers have been trussing women up in spandex.
"I've never liked stretchy clothes," said Ms. Sarne, reached in London. "I feel very encased. I don't like being put into clothes being made by middle-aged men. I know what I want to wear, but I don't think a man knows what I want to wear. I've always liked unstructured clothes that are comfortable, that I can work in and wash in the washing machine."
Ms. Sarne and Katharine Hamnett were each designing their own collections when they joked that they should team up and start a ghost-authored line. She ended up doing it alone, and the name soon illustrated the collection's philosophy. "It's developed into a fluid ghostly look, if you like, quite ethereal."
Sales for Ghost are stronger in the United States than Europe, so much so that Ms. Sarne is seeking a manufacturer here to avoid import duties.
 
Tina Chow, the Collector
 Tina Chow was perhaps not typical of the fashion collector that Christie's East expects to bid on her vintage couture pieces tonight.
"She wasn't obsessed with clothing, but she had a deep appreciation of fabric and construction and design," said her sister, the artist Adelle Lutz. "This probably all came from our mother, who studied couture in Japan. It's the Japanese sensibility of presentation. After you eat dinner, they give you one fine strawberry on a lacquered dish instead of a whole bowl of fruit, and that's how Tina looked at these pieces, with individual appreciation instead of as trends."
Ms. Chow's collection includes Fortuny, Balenciaga, Givenchy, Saint Laurent and Chanel. But Ms. Lutz said, "For me, some of the sweetest pieces are cheongsams, Chinese cut velvet dresses from the 30's or 40's. Cecil Beaton photographed her in these dresses for British Vogue, and that was the last sitting he did."
Before the auction, Mirabella magazine and Christie's will hold a benefit cocktail reception and preview, with proceeds going to AIDS charities. Ms. Chow died of AIDS in January 1992, at 41.
"She was an exception," Kathleen Guzman, the president of Christie's East, said of Ms. Chow, adding that she expected about 50 collectors to bid on the couture tonight, typically "a person who will buy it, save it and hope one day they'll open a museum."
She continued: "The kind of costumes Tina Chow collected transcend the pure collector. A lot of this fashion can be worn today."

HEADLINE: Botanical Garden Joins Company in Drug Search

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
IN one of the largest such arrangements so far, Pfizer Inc. and the New York Botanical Garden are collaborating on a $2 million, three-year effort to collect and study plants from the United States as potential sources of new medicines.
It is the latest in a number of efforts by drug companies to step up prospecting for natural sources of pharmaceuticals. Scientists have found it more difficult than they had hoped to synthesize drugs from scratch, so researchers are turning once again to nature. New technologies for mass screening of plant and animal materials for medicinal properties have made this prospecting more practical in recent years. 
 Much of the action has focused on the tropics, but botanists believe the native plants of the United States also provide a potentially valuable source of drugs.
"Our collaboration with Pfizer seeks to begin the search for new plant-based therapies in our own backyard, so to speak," said Dr. Brian Boom, vice president for botanical sciences at the botanical garden.
The plant world "offers a rich array of naturally bioactive materials," but "only a small percentage of these have ever been subjected to modern techniques for assaying new drugs," said Dr. George M. Milne Jr., president of Pfizer Central Research in Groton, Conn. "We are excited by the prospect of working with the expert scientists" at the botanical garden, he said, "and with the wide range of plant extracts they will provide."
Under the agreement announced yesterday, Pfizer is putting up $2 million to finance the collection and identification of plant samples from across the country by the botanical garden. Pfizer scientists will test extracts from the plants in the hope of discovering either disease-fighting agents or chemical structures that would make it easier to synthesize medicines. If any of the extracts lead to a commercial compound, Pfizer will pay a royalty to the garden.
The agreement is similar in some respects to a landmark collaboration announced two years ago between Merck & Company and Costa Rica's national biological institute. Over two years, Merck paid $1 million for the prospecting and also pledged to pay royalties for any resulting marketable products. Costa Rica, in turn, pledged to use the $1 million to support conservation of the forests in which the plants grow.
Several other companies have undertaken collaborative efforts with botanical researchers in recent years, but the Merck agreement and the one announced yesterday are believed to be the two most expensive.
Plants have been used as medicines for thousands of years. But until recently, screening them to isolate their medicinal properties so that they can be produced in commercial form has been slow and difficult. Now the search has become more feasible as a result of greater knowledge about the chemical mechanisms through which plant compounds act on disease, coupled with the advent of automated screening techniques.
About a quarter of all prescription drugs used in the United States, it is estimated, originated with plants. But only one half of 1 percent of the world's higher plants have been thoroughly screened for their medical potential and chemical composition, said Dr. Michael J. Balick, the director of the New York Botanical Garden's Institute of Economic Botany.
Dr. Balick, who will lead the garden in the Pfizer collaboration, said: "So much attention has been given to the tropics, which certainly are a rich source of plant chemicals, and so little attention to our own area. Both we and Pfizer felt it was time to mount an intensive search within the U.S."

HEADLINE: Zoos Find a New Role In Conserving Species

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
ONE recent afternoon at the Bronx Zoo, Dr. Fred Koontz, the curator of mammals, watched a computer video display in which an oval representing the field of view of an orbiting earth satellite closed in on an area of Cameroon. There, three forest elephants have been fitted with radio transmitters developed in New York and tested on a zoo elephant named Maxine.
The orbiting satellite picks up signals from the elephants and sends reports on their positions to the United States. From these reports ecologists in the Bronx are discerning the animals' patterns of movement to determine their range, habitat and response to human settlements. Without this information a conservation plan for the threatened elephants cannot be devised. Virtually nothing has been known about forest elephant ecology until now because the thick jungle foliage makes the animals hard to follow on the ground. 
 Since the founding of the New York Zoological Society nearly a century ago, it has engaged in wildlife conservation around the globe. But that operation was mainly divorced from the zoo operation in New York, with its considerable knowledge about the biology of animals. Now the field conservation effort is expanding -- it currently includes 158 projects in 41 countries -- and the two operations have been merged. The idea is that the zoo will apply to these operations a range of expertise on animal nutrition, health, handling and reproduction, serving as a support base in ways never tried in the past.
And the leaders of the organization, now called NYZS/the Wildlife Conservation Society in recognition of the new strategy, are spearheading an effort to export their broadened mission to the zoo community at large. If the effort succeeds, it could transform zoos, giving them major roles in field conservation at a time when the shrinking global inventory of living species has become an environmental concern of the first magnitude. If zoos do not get out into the natural world and help conserve it, they risk becoming "quiescent museums," says Dr. William Conway, president of the society.
Zoos and aquariums constitute an extraordinary base of expertise for field conservation operations, said Dr. Conway. If their efforts could be refocused, he said, "it might be that we could really make a difference." Dr. Conway is the chairman of a committee of the American Association Zoological Parks and Aquariums that is investigating ways in which zoos might do that. Its first substantive meeting took place at the association's annual conference in Omaha last week.
"If any of the specialized big mammals, birds and reptiles are to be retained in the shrinking crevices between human populations," Dr. Conway said in a speech at the zoo and aquarium association's meeting in Toronto last year, it will have to be "on the basis of a much more supportive kind of conservation." Such areas -- small, fragmented islands in a sea of habitat disturbed by humans -- will inevitably become "mega-zoos" dependent on human management, he said.
 
Metamorphosis of Zoos
 The Toronto speech turned out to be something of a manifesto for the new campaign to project zoos into field conservation. Afterward, Sydney Butler, the zoo and aquarium association's executive director, enlisted Dr. Conway to head the effort. Though models have been provided by the New York organization and a handful of other zoos, extending the philosophy in practice will not be easy.
The main reason zoos have not been more involved in field conservation "is that there's lots of money tied up in their exhibits and their collections" and "a lot of pressure to keep money at home," said Mr. Butler. But conservation in the field "can also mean local conservation," he said; if a zoo wants to preserve the ecology of Chesapeake Bay, "that's fine with us."
Many zoos have gone through a metamorphosis since the days when they mainly exhibited animals in cages. They have created more natural settings for their animals, developed public education programs tying zoo exhibits to the ecology of the wild and become homes for endangered species, many of which are bred in captivity.
Theoretically, Dr. Conway says, zoos are now proficient enough to breed thousands of species; but in reality, economic factors restrict such programs to a fraction of their potential, and always will. And captive breeding cannot save animal populations in nature, the habitats they live in or "all those grand wildlife spectacles that so move our hearts and inspire our souls," he says. Once one has seen half a million wildebeests migrating in the Serengeti Plain in Tanzania, Dr. Conway said in his Toronto speech, "a remnant dispersed in a few collections is simply not an adequate fulfillment" of a zoo's responsibility.
Captive breeding and the reintroduction of captive-bred animals into the wild "are not panaceas for the endangered species problem" and should be considered only as "two of many weapons in the arsenal available to zoo biologists" to save species, says Dr. Michael Hutchins, the zoo and aquarium association's director of conservation and science.
 
Preservation Around the World
 For years, biologists have fanned out from the New York society's headquarters in the Bronx to study animals in the wild. Some have achieved something of a swashbuckling image. Among them are George Schaller with mountain gorillas in Africa and pandas in China, and David Western with elephants in Kenya. They often became conservationists out of necessity, to preserve the animals they studied.
More recently, the resources of the society, including the zoo, have been more deliberately and systematically focused on preservation. Under Dr. Schaller's leadership, for example, the society has worked with the Chinese Government to set aside a 100,000-square-mile nature preserve in the Qian Tang (pronounced Chahng Tahng) region of Tibet, one of the largest and most unspoiled ecosystems on earth. In Central America, the society is leading a cooperative effort by seven nations to create a protected wildlife corridor stretching from Belize and Guatemala to Panama, along which cougars can travel their natural prehistoric migration route between North and South America.
With habitats for large animals becoming increasingly degraded and fragmented, Bronx Zoo veterinarians have been closely monitoring animal health in the field. "It is a good indicator of environmental degradation," said Dr. William B. Karesh, a Bronx-based field veterinarian. The veterinarians also put out epidemiological brush fires in the wild. Animals are more vulnerable to disease and environmental toxins when habitats and populations contract, and zoo scientists have mounted rescue missions to save disease-ravaged populations.
Scientists at the zoo are investigating the effects of human handling on animals that must be moved around in the wild, a necessary evil in managing diminished populations. "What we're finding, for instance, is that actually knocking down some of these animals," as must be done to capture them, "has profound physiological consequences, and we're going to have to be much more careful than we've ever been in the past about what we do," said Dr. John Robinson, a vice president of the society.
Zoo scientists are working to develop genetic markers for elephant ivory in an effort to trace illegally traded ivory to its area of origin. They are studying the effects of temperature on anacondas, which are increasingly being hunted for their skins, to learn about their habitat requirements so that a conservation plan can be worked out. And on any given day, visitors to the Bronx Zoo may see exhibited animals wearing miniature radio transmitters that are being tested in a continuing program to improve the tracking of wild animals. The zoo, said Dr. Koontz, is becoming the "tool box" of field conservation.
Since conservation does not take place in a social and economic vaccum, Bronx-based conservationists are paying more systematic attention to working with national governments, local politicians and international aid agencies to preserve habitats and protect animals. The ultimate goal is to transfer expertise and technology to developing countries so that they can take the lead in their own conservation efforts.
While few zoos can boast the long history or breadth of the New York society's programs, some are beginning to get involved in field conservation. For instance, the Minnesota Zoological Garden at Apple Valley, Minn., and the Potter Park Zoological Gardens in Lansing, Mich., are jointly helping an effort to save the 400 Sumatran tigers thought to remain in the wild. The Toledo Zoological Park in Ohio is doing the same for the endangered Aruba Island rattlesnake. And in an example of what is called the adopt-a-park concept, the Minnesota Zoo has linked up with Ujung Kulon National Park on the island of Java in Indonesia to save what may be the most endangered mammal in the world, the Javan rhinoceros. Fewer than 50 remain, all in Ujung Kulon.
These sorts of activities, according to the new thinking, are not just desirable, they are critical to the future of zoos. To "retain their relevance in a changing world and ultimately insure their own survival," says Dr. Hutchins, "zoological institutions must change, and change rapidly."

WANG LABORATORIES EMERGES FROM BANKRUPTCY

 BODY:
As expected, Wang Laboratories Inc. emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday. The company's business plan was approved by Federal Bankruptcy Judge William C. Hillman in Boston. And the plan received approval from 94 percent of the creditors and 97 percent of the equity holders, Joseph M. Tucci, Wang's chief executive, said. The Lowell, Mass., company filed for Chapter 11 on Aug. 18, 1992. 
 Mr. Tucci said a bidding war had taken place between the Steinhardt Management Company of New York and another group of investors over a $60 million private sale of preferred stock and warrants in the new company, resulting in an improved deal for Wang. Steinhardt accepted a lower interest rate and 1.5 million shares rather than 2.4 million shares of stock. Wang, which had made its name in computer hardware, will now concentrate its efforts in the software business.

HEADLINE: Health Care Plan Would Take Double Tax Bite

 BODY:

To the Editor
"Health Aides See a Tax on Benefits Beyond Basic Plan" (front page, Sept. 5) reports an Administration proposal under which both workers and companies would have to pay Federal income tax on employer-provided health benefits if they exceed those in the standard package to be guaranteed to all Americans. 
 You focus on the politics of the proposal. But regardless of the politics, the idea is bad tax policy.
Under a personal income tax, all earnings should be taxed at the same rate, no matter in what form they are paid. Employers can now deduct payments to their workers, whether these payments are wages or health insurance benefits. The workers pay taxes on the wages, but not on the benefits. This violates the basic principle of the same rate of taxation.
However, the Administration proposal is a violation in the other direction -- "excess benefits" are doubled taxed, first at the employer level (because they are not deductible) and again at the worker's level. In effect, workers who want more insurance (even for good reasons) are discriminated against by the tax law.
How can the double tax be justified? One might argue that the Administration has come up with an insurance package that is perfect for everyone. Therefore, the double tax is designed to punish those with the presumption to want more than that much insurance. But there is nothing socially undesirable about spending your money on health insurance, if that is what you want to do. Alternatively, the Administration's goal may simply be to raise more taxes, whether or not the method is sensible or fair.

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW;
U.S. Supports Move By Russian Leader To Break Deadlock

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
President Clinton, taken by surprise by the events in Moscow, moved swiftly today to throw the support of the United States behind President Boris N. Yeltsin in his showdown with the Russian Parliament.
"I support him fully," Mr. Clinton said in a statement released by the White House late this afternoon after Mr. Clinton was able to hold a 17-minute telephone conversation with the Russian leader. And Mr. Clinton and other White House officials were in touch with European allies tonight to encourage them to issue similar statements of support for Mr. Yeltsin on Wednesday. 
 Although there had been hints from Russian officials that such a confrontation might occur, the United States was informed by Mr. Yeltsin about his plans only an hour before his televised speech in which he ordered the disbanding of the Soviet-era Parliament and the calling of elections for a new legislature in December.
The White House scrambled throughout the afternoon to monitor and respond to the fast-moving developments, which included the vote later by the Russian Parliament to depose Mr. Yeltsin and install his bitter rival, Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, as acting president.
There is uncertainty in Washington tonight about whether Mr. Yeltsin will succeed. But having thrown its support repeatedly on Mr. Yeltsin's side in the past, the Clinton Administration was in no mood to change partners at this crucial moment in Moscow.
The Pentagon reported no troop movements around Moscow, and there was no advance indication here on how the political standoff would be resolved.
In embracing the Russian leader, the United States has decided that his suspension of a Parliament elected under Communist Party voting rules and largely hostile to Mr. Yeltsin's reforms is acceptable because Mr. Yeltsin promised new balloting in the name of democracy.
It was almost with a sigh of relief that after President Clinton telephoned Mr. Yeltsin, he said he came away convinced that the Russian leader would act in a way "that insures peace, stability and an open political process this autumn."
 
'Democratic and Free' Vote
 "He told me that it is of the utmost importance that the elections he has called be organized and held on a democratic and free basis," Mr. Clinton said.
The President justified Mr. Yeltsin's actions as a necessary jolt that broke the political gridlock in Moscow. Mr. Clinton said the Russian President's actions "underscore the complexity of the reform process that he is leading."
"There is no question that President Yeltsin acted in response to a constitutional crisis that had reached a critical impasse and had paralyzed the political process," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Rutskoi, who was interviewed by telephone by Chris Wallace on the ABC News program Nightline, objected to Mr. Clinton's support for Mr. Yeltsin.
"I am very deeply disappointed that the President of the United States is supporting these anti-constitutional actions," Mr. Rutskoi said. "If he sees these measures as being reform-like, he is deeply mistaken in that."
 
'Investment' in U.S. Security
 At the State Department, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters that American support for Mr. Yeltsin's efforts for reform was "an investment in the national security of the United States."
Mr. Christopher declined to answer a question about whether Mr. Yeltsin had exceeded his authority under Russian law, saying, "I am not going to get into a discussion of Russian constitutional and legal issues."
The Clinton Administration's gamble in its support for Mr. Yeltsin on his unpredictable course was highlighted in a briefing for reporters by a senior Administration official this evening.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Yeltsin assured Mr. Clinton twice during their conversation of his intention to take steps that "will quicken the pace of reform." But the official also said: "There are uncertainties and risks associated with this course. I don't think anyone would deny it. I don't think President Yelstin would deny it."
The Administration's reaction is consistent with what it said last March, when Mr. Yeltsin threatened to suspend Parliament and abolish the Soviet-era Constitution, and the Administration stuck by him.
But Mr. Yeltsin's move today puts Washington in a bind. On the one hand, it sees Mr. Yeltsin as the country's best hope for democracy, a sort of Russian style Charles de Gaulle delivering his country from chaos by assuming authoritarian powers. To help drum up support for Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Clinton telephoned Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to relate his conversation with Mr. Yeltsin, the White House said.
On the other hand, the Administration knows that what is most important in Russia -- the continuation of democratic and economic reform -- transcends the political fortunes of one man.
 
No Unusual Troop Movements
 At the Pentagon, officials said tonight there were no unusual movements of strategic or conventional Russian forces since Mr. Yeltsin's declaration. Defense Secretary Les Aspin had not tried to contact the Russian Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, a Pentagon spokesman said. "People are comfortable that their nuclear weapons are under positive control and everything is normal," said one Defense Department official.
In his briefing with reporters, Mr. Christopher said that the Russians gave the United States only about one hour's advance notice about the constitutional coup.
Russia's Foreign Ministry called in Thomas Pickering, the United States Ambassador to Moscow, and the ambassadors from Britain, France, Italy, Canada, Japan and Germany less than an hour before Mr. Yeltsin appeared on national television with his announcement.
Mr. Christopher received the first hint of today's actions last week, when Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, pulled him aside and suggested that there might be a political showdown in Moscow within a matter of days, a senior Administration official said. But Mr. Kozyrev, who was in Washington for last week's signing of the Israeli-Palestinian accord, did not tell Mr. Christopher directly that Mr. Yeltsin would dissolve the Parliament, the official said.
"It was a cryptic reference, not specific enough to know for certain something was going to happen," the senior official said. "Clearly, in retrospect, Kozyrev was trying to give the Secretary a signal."
 
Dissolution Not Expected
 One senior Administration official who closely follows Russia said it was assumed within the Administration that Mr. Yeltsin would give the Russian Parliament an ultimatum, but it was not expected that he would dissolve it.
Mr. Christopher, meanwhile, briefed key legislators this afternoon on the rapidly unfolding events in Moscow and urged them to redouble their efforts to pass an ambitious aid package for Russia.
Thus far, there is no inclination in Congress to penalize Mr. Yeltsin by withholding American aid, although some lawmakers urged the United States to make clear that the democratic process is more important than the fate of one political leader.

HEADLINE: Democratic Split Over Trade Agreement Widens

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
The cracks in the Democratic Party over the North American Free Trade Agreement widened into a public crater today when Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the majority leader in the House of Representatives, announced his opposition to the accord.
At the White House, President Clinton, who has promised to work hard to win Congressional approval for the agreement, said of Mr. Gephardt's defection, "It doesn't help, but I don't think it's fatal." 
 Mr. Gephardt's position was not a surprise. He has been closely aligned with organized labor throughout his career, and the unions are ferociously opposed to the trade agreement. But Administration officials and some of Mr. Gephardt's friends in Congress were a bit taken aback by the splash with which he announced his stand.
They had been led to believe that the Missouri Congressman would play down his opposition to the trade measure and say he planned to concentrate on health care legislation, on which he sides with the President. Instead, Mr. Gephardt rented a room at the National Press Club and, before television cameras, read a 45-minute speech in which he called the accord a threat to American jobs, wages and living standards and potentially damaging to the environment.
 
Clinton's Perspective
 The trade agreement, which requires majority approval from the House and the Senate before it can go into effect, would remove trade barriers between the United States, Mexico and Canada over the next 10 years, creating a huge North American free trade zone like the European Community. From Mr. Clinton's perspective, it is the most important issue facing votes in Congress the rest of this year, since health care will not be taken up until next year.
"President Clinton knows of my support for him and his Administration," Mr. Gephardt said. "I helped him achieve success on his economic plan, and I will be there by his side on health care, education, welfare reform, Russian aid and countless other issues. On this issue, as it stands, however, I must part company."
His colleagues in Congress expect that while he will speak and vote against the trade pact, Mr. Gephardt will not try to line up votes. "I don't think you're going to see Dick arm-twisting," said Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, one of about a dozen Democratic Representatives who went to the Press Club this afternoon to underscore their alliance with the majority leader.
Mr. Gephardt suggested as much in answer to questions. He emphasized that he would speak out on the merits and not the politics of the trade pact, insisted that his ability to control others' votes had been exaggerated and maintained, "I bring to this one vote."
Still, Mr. Gephardt is enormously influential, not only because of his position as party leader but also because other Democratic representatives respect his intelligence and the diligence with which he approaches issues. Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip, is also opposing the pact. Their defection offers political cover to others who would like to vote against the trade pact but are worried about opposing the President.
It is unusual but not unheard of for leaders in Congress to oppose a President from their own party. Most recently, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the No. 2 Republican in the House, led a large majority of Republicans in 1985 against Ronald Reagan's bill to overhaul the Federal income tax system.
Still, Presidents rarely rely on the opposition party to the extent Mr. Clinton is depending on Republican votes on the trade bill.
 
Looking for 30 Votes
 Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who is coordinating the campaign in Congress in favor of the measure, said today that only 66 of the 258 Democrats in the House were committed to vote for the measure. He said he needed to persuade 30 or 35 more to reach enough votes to pass the bill. Mr. Matsui said he was counting on at least 120 of the 175 Republicans to vote for it.
If the House votes in favor of the legislation, the Senate is expected to do so also.
After the Gephardt speech, the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, and other Democratic representatives who support the trade measure counterpunched with their own news conference. One of those lined up with Mr. Foley was Representative Vic Fazio, a California Democrat, who expressed his support publicly in Washington for the first time. He could be important in swaying Democrats on the fence because he is chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises and distributes money to candidates for Congress.
Across the Capitol, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, held a news conference with Senators Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Max Baucus of Montana to stress that some Democrats in the Senate were on the President's side.
 
Public Evenly Divided
 The latest New York Times/CBS News poll of 1,136 adults nationwide found that the public was fairly evenly divided on the trade matter but that the opponents of the agreement felt more strongly about the issue than those in favor. More than a quarter of those questioned had no position, meaning that public opinion could shift markedly in the weeks ahead.
The poll was taken by telephone on Thursday through Sunday and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Mr. Gephardt had withheld public judgment on the trade pact until he had assessed the side agreements negotiated this summer on labor and environmental issues. Today, he pronounced them inadequate.
Low wages, the acceptance of poor working conditions and lax environmental standards in Mexico, he said, would encourage American companies to invest there instead of at home.
"The agreement isn't sound, and our economy isn't ready for it," Mr. Gephardt declared. "In fact, the greatest failures in the agreement could exacerbate our worst economic problems: disappearing jobs and declining real incomes. Against the economic backdrop of the last 12 years, people are right to be concerned about the future."

HEADLINE: Going on Offensive, Whitman Plans Cuts In New Jersey Taxes

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CLARK, N.J., Sept. 21

 BODY:
Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey, announced an economic plan today with a promise over the next three years to make the most sweeping tax cuts in state history, to reduce the size of government and to create 450,000 jobs.
"This is radical, but when you look at what's happened to this state over the last three and one-half years, then it's obvious something radical has to happen," Mrs. Whitman said at a news conference. "If not, we are going to become a third-world country in this state." 
 As much as the plan is an economic blueprint for New Jersey under Mrs. Whitman as governor, it is a calculated political maneuver that she hopes will put her Republican candidacy on the offensive against Gov. Jim Florio, a Democrat, in the remaining six weeks of the gubernatorial race. Besides releasing her economic plan today, Mrs. Whitman also began broadcasting ads for the first time, including one touting the new tax cut.
Mrs. Whitman promised $1.4 billion in tax cuts, some to take place immediately and others to be phased in over the first three years of her administration. She said her plan would bring tax rates for some people back to the 1976 rates.
"My plan clearly and convincingly favors the hard-working middle-income citizens and taxpayers of this state," she said.
In a race in which polls show the two major candidates in a statistical tie and 9 to 12 percent of the electorate undecided, the fiscal issue is Mrs. Whitman's political trump card and she played it today, exactly six weeks before the Nov. 2 election, gambling that it will rekindle white-hot voter anger over Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990 and remove doubt about her own leadership abilities.
While Mrs. Whitman's plan was sweeping in its promises, it was short on details of how she planned to cut taxes and cover a projected $1 billion shortfall in the state budget for the next fiscal year. She did mention these specifics: an immediate move after taking office to reduce the number of state patronage employees being paid more than $50,000, the sale of the governor's helicopter, a 20 percent cut in the governor's staff and the privatization of government operations where feasible.
The centerpiece of Mrs. Whitman's proposal is a 30 percent income tax rate reduction -- 10 percent per year over three years starting with the 1995 tax year -- for every taxpayer with taxable income up to $80,000. It would cost the state $351 million a year in lost revenue over three years for a total of $1.053 billion in lost revenue.
For a married couple filing jointly and with a total taxable income of $50,000 a year, it would mean a savings of $345 annually.
Her proposal would eliminate state income tax entirely for individuals or married couples who make less than $7,500 a year in taxable income. It would save those wage earners $150 a year and increase the number of tax-exempt residents by 350,000, at a cost to the state of $35 million a year in revenue.
"In order to overcome the imbalances in the Florio administration's budget and to fund our tax cuts, we need to find approximately $900 million in savings in the first 18 months of my administration," Mrs. Whitman said.
 
Busy Maneuvering
 Mrs. Whitman said she would reach her goal "with tax reductions to create jobs and rejuvenate the economy" and promised budget savings and the leadership to control government growth, pledging to hold total spending increases to 3 percent a year, half the current growth rate.
On what could prove to be one of the most pivotal issues in the gubernatorial race, both sides worked furiously to outmaneuver the other.
Hours before Mrs. Whitman met with reporters here at a hotel near her campaign headquarters, Mr. Florio was in Newark trying to mute some of his opponent's political thunder by staging a reception in which a coalition of corporate leaders endorsed his re-election bid.
Mrs. Whitman timed the release of her economic plan -- announced at a 2:30 P.M. news conference -- to limit the response time that her rival had to start picking it apart on the first day.
The expected onslaught was not long in coming.
"Her plan is welfare for the rich," the Florio campaign said in a news release issued about an hour after Mrs. Whitman's news conference ended. "It gives someone making $300,000 a year a tax cut of $4,000, and gives a hard-working middle-class family less than $350.
"One of the big problems in evaluating this plan is that Mrs. Whitman won't even say how she's going to pay for this."
 
Panel of Experts
 The plan was drawn up by Mrs. Whitman's Council for Economic Recovery, a panel of fiscal, tax and business experts she created in July to devise an economic platform for her. The council was led by two co-chairmen -- Lawrence Kudlow, senior managing director and chief economist of New York City-based Bear Stearns & Company, and Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., president and chief executive officers of Forbes Inc. and editor-in-chief of Forbes magazine.
As Deputy Budget Director under during the Reagan Presidency, Mr. Kudlow was a chief proponent of supply-side economics, the theory that you can increase government revenue by cutting taxes and allowing business to flourish. That philosophy is at the center of Mrs. Whitman's plan, Mr. Kudlow said today.
On July 14, only days after winning the Republican nomination, Mrs. Whitman announced the creation of her economic council and said its members would help her develop an agenda on seven specific subject areas: taxes and budget, information services, sports and tourism, agriculture, financial services, organized labor and urban business. She said that as governor she would rely on some of the same advisers.
 
Political Trump Card
 At the time she announced the formation of the council, Mrs. Whitman did not say when she would make her economic plan public. As the summer passed and Mr. Florio increased his pressure on her to tell what she would do as governor, the economic blueprint grew into a crucial issue for the Whitman campaign.
Releasing her economic plan gives Mrs. Whitman her clearest chance yet to define the campaign agenda, but the move is not without risks.
Only a day after the June 8 primary, Mrs. Whitman criticized Mr. Florio for raising the issue of a tax cut, saying it was cynical to do so. She was forced to back off that stance because of strong support for tax cuts by members of the Republican legislative majority, with the powerful Assembly Speaker, Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian, as the principal champion of the idea.
Mrs. Whitman said today that she said it would have been cynical to propose a tax increase without first identifying how to pay for it.
"I've done that," she said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: White House Memo;
If It's Tuesday It Must Be . . . Health, Nafta, Yeltsin, Lunch

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
The big house on Pennsylvania Avenue rang today with the clamor of its distant Jacksonian past.
Not in many years have as many people from as many different groups poured into the salons and onto the lawns of the White House in one day on as many different errands. Government activism is back in vogue, and this was a great chance to watch the show. 
 "Bill-signing on the South Lawn, talk-show hosts on the North Lawn, big-shots for lunch, and, yeah, Yeltsin on the phone," David R. Gergen, the Presidential counselor, said.
President Clinton, smiling, as he walked into a luncheon for about 20 newspaper and magazine columnists and bureau chiefs, said, "Place is buzzing like a beehive." At the luncheon, Mr. Clinton and his wife made their umpty-umpth concerted sales pitch for the Administration's health plan -- this one on the eve of the President's television speech disclosing its terms to the nation.
A few of the political pieces fell into place on schedule today; the endorsement of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. was one. But both Mr. Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton made it clear at lunch that in the course of the long debate ahead they knew they would have to make concessions to win further backing, phasing in universal coverage over a longer period than the planned three years. [Page A24.]
The message was compromise, flexibility, dialogue -- a far cry from the ideological war whoops that accompanied the budget battles last spring.
"As we move forward in the discussion," Mrs. Clinton said, "if we keep our focus on the principles that we think should guide this debate and the destination that we're all trying to get to, then we will have a very fruitful discussion in the Congress and we'll put together a bipartisan majority."
All day long, the ordinarily muffled corridors and waiting rooms of the White House were jammed with visitors, and long lines formed at many of the gates to the grounds.
"Bustle, energy," said George Stephanopoulos, one of Mr. Clinton's top advisers, in an essay in noun control. "No chaos, no disorganization."
Only the worker-bees were a bit grumpy. All the carryings-on, said a Presidential aide, had come close to overwhelming guards, groundskeepers, cooks and other members of the permanent staff. The Secret Service ran out of one type of identification tag for visitors and had to substitute another.
This morning, Mr. Clinton repaired to a huge tent, thrown up overnight on the South Lawn, to sign legislation creating a National Service Program.Hundreds came to watch him do it, including college presidents and professors, Sargent Shriver, the first head of the Peace Corps, a passel of excited college reporters, a grunge band in the obligatory torn jeans and long hair, and Tabitha Soren, the 20-something news commentator on MTV.
After lunch, the President lobbied 250 talk-show hosts from around the country, some of whom set up shop on the South Lawn. Rush Limbaugh was not there, having declined an invitation, but Blanquita Cullum of WLEE radio in Richmond came, even though Mr. Clinton is not at all her ideological cup of tea. She worked for the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the Reagan Administration, and she said her taste ran more to Patrick J. Buchanan.
When the President told them he had just had lunch with some columnists, the broadcasters laughed.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," he said, ever eager to play to the audience at hand. "Would it make you feel better if I said I didn't enjoy it?"
 
A Talk With Yeltsin
 Then he went back to his office to talk by telephone with President Boris N. Yeltsin about the Russian leader's decision to disband Parliament.
Something of the social engineer's optimism that often gripped the White House as Lyndon B. Johnson pushed through the Great Society gripped it today. Surprisingly often, the concerns at the center of government are petty and parochial, but no one doubts that the health care plan is different -- the last unfinished business of the New Deal, as many call it, a program in the Roosevelt-Truman-Johnson tradition, with the potential for sweeping social, economic and political change.
The President, who likes to hark back to his political idols, the Kennedys, looked back farther today, recalling that it was 50 years ago, in 1943, when the first measure proposing national health insurance was introduced.
It was sponsored by three gung-ho New Dealers -- Senator Robert F. Wagner of New York, Senator James E. Murray of Montana and Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, whose son sits in the House today. It was called "socialized medicine" by its foes and died a swift death, like two similar bills introduced by Harry S. Truman.
 
Clintons Love the Issue
 Both Mr. and Mrs. Clinton seemed fired by the sense that after all the distractions and dead ends of the last six months -- the haircut and travel-office imbroglios and the fights over homosexuals in the military -- they had finally reached the issue that may make or break this Presidency.
The details may confound many people and bore others, but "she loves this stuff, and so does he," Mr. Stephanopoulos said in a tone of wonderment.
Never mind that they had made many of the same arguments and answered many of the same questions a dozen times this week in conversations with television broadcasters, doctors, talk-show hosts, members of Congress, executives of small businesses, hospital administrators and anyone else who might have some effect, great or small, on the plan's fate; they did it again, radiating enthusiasm.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Poll on Changes in Health Care Finds Support Amid Skepticism

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
President Clinton tonight addresses a nation that is already convinced that the health care system is in crisis and, by a strong majority, says that it is willing to pay higher taxes to make health insurance secure and available to all, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
But the survey also shows a deep skepticism about the ability of the Government to achieve a successful overhaul of the system. Americans were sharply divided on whether the President "will be able to bring about significant health care reform," the survey found: 45 percent said he would, 41 percent said he would not. 
 Still, as Mr. Clinton prepares to present his plan before a joint session of Congress in a speech that will be broadcast nationally, starting at 9 P.M., there was much in the poll to support the notion that Americans have, at the very least, reached a consensus on the need for change and on a set of basic goals.
 
Support for Higher Taxes
 The survey shows overwhelming majorities support the idea of assuring health coverage to all Americans and guaranteeing that no one ever loses their insurance when they switch jobs or suffer a medical catastrophe. Sixty-one percent said they were willing to pay higher taxes to achieve those goals, and more than half said they were willing to have the Government require employers to pay most of the health insurance premiums to cover their workers -- a centerpiece of the Clinton plan.
When asked to name "the most important problem facing the country today," the public now rates health care second only to the economy. Forty-two percent said the nation needs to "completely rebuild" the health care system, with another 48 percent calling for "fundamental change." This sense of urgency runs across party lines -- 85 percent of the Republicans said they supported fundamental change or complete rebuilding -- and helps explain the bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for restructuring the system.
The survey was conducted last Thursday through Sunday by telephone with 1,136 adults nationwide. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. In addition to sampling error, the difficulties of conducting a survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into polls. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for example, can lead to somewhat different results.
 
High Stakes for Clinton
 For all the furor over the President's health care proposals in recent weeks as the details have filtered out and experts and constituent groups have weighed in, the poll indicates that most of the public has yet to fully focus on it. Eighty-four percent said it was too early for them to have a good understanding of what the Clinton plan will mean. Only 23 percent said they had heard or read "a lot" about the plan.
All of this raises the stakes for Mr. Clinton's speech tonight.
The verdict on the status quo was clear: 65 percent said they were dissatisfied with the cost of their health care, even if they did not pay for it directly; 55 percent said they were dissatisfied with their out-of-pocket costs for health care. And people were evenly divided when asked what worried them more: the cost of health care or not having enough coverage when they needed it.
Still, in keeping with earlier surveys, 71 percent said they were satisfied with the quality of their care. This explains why the White House has taken such pains to argue that the system can be restructured without sacrificing the quality.
In general, the survey found strong public support for some of the major goals the President has articulated for his plan: 83 percent, for example, said it was "very important" that "any health care reform plan" makes sure all Americans are covered. Sixty-seven percent said it was "very important" that such a plan cover long-term care for the disabled at home, another feature of the Clinton plan. And 73 percent said it was "very important" that preventive care be covered, which Clinton Administration officials say was a guiding principle in developing the basic benefit package.
 
Substantial Skepticism
 But between the idea of health care reform and the reality, the survey found substantial skepticism. Not surprisingly, most of the Democrats (62 percent) said they thought Mr. Clinton would be able to "bring about significant health care reform." But just 29 percent of the Republicans, and 29 percent of those who voted for Ross Perot, said they thought Mr. Clinton would be able to do so.
This skepticism was about the same among those who said they knew a lot about the Clinton plan and those who did not.
Similarly, people were sharply divided when asked if "the health care reform plan Bill Clinton is proposing is fair to people like you, or not?" Forty percent said it was fair, 36 percent said it was not. Younger people were more likely to think it would be fair to them; older people tended to be more skittish. Again, this judgment followed party lines, with Democrats likely to think it fair, Republicans likely to think it unfair and Perot voters evenly divided.
Perot voters, often characterized by their mistrust of government, were also skeptics when asked: "In the next few years, if the Clinton health care reform plan is adopted, do you think it will make health care in the United States better, make health care worse, or won't it have much impact one way or the other?" Fifty-seven percent of the Perot supporters said they thought it would make it worse or have little impact; 49 percent of the independents (an overlapping category) felt that way.
By comparison, 29 percent of the Democrats and 62 percent of the Republicans fell into that category of skeptics.
 
Modest Expectations
 The expectations of middle America for the Clinton health care plan seem, in some respects, quite modest. Despite the protestations from the White House, 80 percent in the survey said they expect their taxes will go up under the Clinton plan. Forty-five percent said they expect the amount they pay for health care will go up, and 53 percent said they expected the quality of their care to stay the same. Another 23 percent said they expect the quality to decline and 17 percent expect it to increase.
Seventy-six percent in the survey said they currently have a doctor they consider their own, and this relationship has a high value to them. Sixty-five percent of them said they would be willing to pay extra to keep seeing that doctor.
Still, there was an openness to the idea of health maintenance organizations and other types of alternatives to traditional fee for service medicine: 54 percent said they would be willing to choose a doctor from a limited list of qualified doctors if it meant that all Americans would be guaranteed health care. Fifty percent said they would wait longer for non-emergency appointments if it would further that goal.
But the idea of rationing stirs strong resistance. Only 36 percent said they would be willing, for the sake of universal coverage, to stop paying for expensive treatments that would extend a patient's life for only a short time.
The public supported several options to raise money to extend health insurance to all. Seventy-nine percent were willing to raise taxes on liquor; 73 percent said they were willing to increase the tax on cigarettes by $1 a pack. And 75 percent said they were willing to save money on Medicare by limiting how much doctors and hospitals can charge the Government for elderly patients -- suggesting a potentially popular way for the Administration to talk about cutting the rate of spending growth on Medicare.
The idea of requiring employers to provide insurance to their workers had the support of 54 percent. That rose to 63 percent when it was explicitly presented as a means of insuring health coverage to all Americans.
But there were substantial fears about the job impact of such a requirement. Those fears eased substantially when people were told that such a requirement could be coupled with subsidies to ease the burden on small businesses, which the Administration has promised to do.

HEADLINE: Studies Show Futility of Rushing Some Heart Victims to Hospitals

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

 BODY:
It is futile, and economically wasteful, for emergency medical workers to rush heart attack victims to the hospital after efforts to resuscitate them in the field have failed, two major studies have found.
The studies, done in Memphis and Houston, add to a growing body of evidence that patients who do not respond to advanced cardiac life support before being rushed to a hospital have little chance of survival, researchers said yesterday. 
 Because of the high costs of hospital emergency care that does not improve the chance of living, and the risks associated with high-speed transport of patients, policies that require that all heart attack victims be rushed to a hospital should be abandoned, they concluded.
In studies being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers said that after examining thousands of heart attack cases, they found that only about a half of 1 percent of patients who were not revived with a pulse at the scene of their heart attack ultimately survived. And of the few who survived to leave the hospital, virtually all suffered permanent cerebral disability, the reports said.
Dr. Arthur L. Kellermann, the lead researcher of the 39-month University of Tennessee study of emergency cardiac care in Memphis, said the latest research clearly shows that rapid transport of unresponsive heart attack victims does not save lives.
"We need to make every effort we can to get the best care to the heart victim where he is," Dr. Kellermann said in a telephone interview. "But if the patient is so far gone that there isn't enough life left to be fanned back into a flame, we need to make the decision that we have done all that is possible and stop."
 
Cardiac Care Guidelines
 Dr. Kellermann, who has left Tennessee and is now director of Emory University's Center for Injury Prevention in Atlanta, said the recommendations of his study and a companion study done by researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston are consistent with 1992 emergency cardiac care guidelines published by the American Heart Association.
The association said resuscitation may be discontinued in a pre-hospital setting when the patient remains unresponsive after adequate tries at emergency cardiac life support, provided no positive prognostic signs were evident.
Sudden cardiac arrest kills about 250,000 Americans a year. In areas that have model emergency medical systems -- Milwaukee and Seattle, for example -- up to 35 percent of cardiac arrest patients survive to leave the hospital, experts said. Survival rates vary widely from city to city, they said, but are generally 15 percent to 20 percent.
More than a half dozen previous studies in the last eight years have added to growing evidence that the most crucial time in caring for cardiac arrest patients is immediately after the event, the researchers said. The data show that if paramedics arrive quickly enough and restore heart rhythm and pulse, the patient has a good chance of surviving to reach the hospital and get further care. If the patient cannot be revived and stabilized, the studies show, the patient's chances of reaching the hospital alive are slim and of surviving to discharge even slimmer.
The new studies are the first to look prospectively, or as they happen, at large groups of cardiac cases that were handled by emergency medical systems involving many hospitals in a community.
The Memphis researchers, including Dr. Bela B. Hackman and Dr. Grant Somes, examined the cases of 1,068 adult cardiac arrest victims and found that 71 percent never regained a pulse after advanced life-support attempts by paramedics and that only 7 percent of those survived to be admitted to a hospital. Of the 29 percent who did respond to emergency care, 69 percent of those survived to be admitted and 26.5 percent lived to be discharged, compared with only 0.4 percent who lived to be discharged in the non-responsive group, the study said.
The Houston study, conducted by Dr. Marni J. Bonnin, Dr. Paul E. Pepe and others, looked at 1,322 similar cardiac arrest cases over 18 months and recorded similar outcomes. The study noted that all of those who survived to be discharged had regained circulation within 25 minutes after paramedics arrived and began giving treatment, which included opening airways and providing oxygen, administering electric shocks to restore heart rhythm and administering heart medication.
The results of these studies indicate resuscitation efforts can be ended in the field if patients do not respond, the Houston paper said, "but it must be recognized that these conclusions remain valid only as long as new or unusual treatment advances have not become available."
 
Weigh Survival Against Risks
 Dr. Kellermann said the ethics of stopping futile rescue attempts must weigh the slim chance of the patient's survival against the risk to the lives of emergency personnel and the public in high-speed transport accidents, which claim a score of lives each year. In addition, emergency room staff must be diverted from other patients in need, and hospitals must bare the cost of using dwindling resources to deal with hopeless cases, he said.
The Texas researchers estimated that the cost for each patient seen, tested and pronounced dead by a hospital emergency department at $2,000 to $3,000. Based on the incidence of cardiac arrest in the country, they estimated that continued but futile resuscitative efforts cost the nation up to $500 million annually.
In an editorial in the journal, Dr. William A. Gray of Southwest Cardiology Associates in Albuquerque, N.M., said an earlier study estimated that it also cost an additional $500 million to hospitalize those who initially fail to be revived in the field and fail to survive to be discharged.
"All of that time and money is spent for little or no benefit in overall survival," Dr. Gray wrote. "This is difficult to justify any longer when health care costs are coming under such intense scrutiny."

HEADLINE: Two Die as Nicaraguan Strikers Clash With Police

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Sept. 21

 BODY:
A nationwide transport strike turned deadly today as armed workers clashed with police, and Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega called for the ouster of the Government.
"The people are going to put a finish to this Government," said Mr. Ortega, whose leftist Sandinista government was defeated by President Violeta de Barrios Chamorro in elections in 1990. 
 A police officer and a bystander were killed and at least two other people wounded in a shootout between striking transportation workers and the police on a major highway outside Managua.
The violence on a highway near the international airport led American and Continental airlines to cancel scheduled flights to Nicaragua, officials of the United States-based airlines said. Each airline has one flight daily.
The strike had raised fears that Nicaragua's political crisis could deepen further. Hostage-taking by rearmed fighters on both sides of the civil war, and bitter political infighting, have continued to stall the nation's economic recovery.
United States-backed Contra rebels fought for most of the 1980's to overthrow the Sandinista Government.
Mr. Ortega, Mrs. Chamorro's predecessor as President, blamed her for the deaths.
He called for a "joining of ranks to unleash a popular battle in the streets."
"I don't see any other way out other than by the protests of the people," Mr. Ortega said.
The police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and then live rounds during the shootout with armed strikers manning flaming barricades on the Pan American Highway.
The indefinite strike by bus, taxi and truck drivers started Monday to protest a Government increase in fuel prices and imposition of vehicle taxes.

HEADLINE: Haiti in Turmoil as It Awaits Aristide

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Five weeks before the planned return of Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Haitians and foreign diplomats say the country's transition faces grave threats from logistical and political problems and from a wave of violence sweeping the country.
Hoping to shore up Father Aristide's transitional Government and send a message of its commitment to the restoration of democracy in Haiti, a high-level delegation of Clinton Administration officials arrived on Monday for a three-day visit. 
 The delegation, which is led by Alexander Watson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Hemispheric Affairs, includes two generals, who diplomats said had been included as a reminder to their Haitian counterparts about Washington's determination to insure Father Aristide's return on Oct. 30.
Seeking to dispel doubts, Mr. Watson said at a news conference today, "Not only do we think it is possible to return by Oct. 31, but we expect that he will be here to assume his responsibilities."
 
Killings by Auxiliary Police
 Since its installation earlier this month, the Government of Prime Minister Robert Malval, an interim leader chosen by Father Aristide, has been repeatedly and openly threatened by auxiliary police agents known as attaches, who have kept Cabinet ministers from using their offices and killed supporters of the deposed President.
United Nations and Organization of American States officials say they have documented many cases in recent weeks in which the attaches, working with apparent police and military complicity, have killed and kidnapped supporters of Father Aristide.
In the most flagrant example, on Sept. 11, one of the President's most prominent backers, Antoine Izmery, was dragged from a church service by a plainclothes attache and shot dead in the street. Officials who were present said that police officers nearby made no attempt to arrest the killer.
The new Government has been prevented by bands of thugs from taking control of the state media, and on several occasions attempts to occupy Government offices have been broken up by threats of violence.
Incidents like these have created deep divisions among Haitians and diplomats involved in the transition, with diplomats leading the political discussions insisting that things are firmly on track despite the violence. Others warn that the entire process is in disarray.
 
Differing Views of Violence
 These growing differences come through most clearly in discussions of the rising violence that has hit the country in recent weeks.
"It has been hyped way beyond the reality of what it is," said one senior American official, speaking on the eve of the Administration team's visit.
But many Haitian officials and foreign diplomats have begun to wonder if those managing the transition have lost sight of reality on the ground and warning that Father Aristide's return is increasingly threatened.
"I always thought this could work, but the international community has underestimated the gravity of the situation, and personally, I think things look very bad," said one senior diplomat involved in the transition, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "Attaches are having regular meetings, guns are being distributed in the countryside, and in the capital the violence is just steadily rising."
United Nations officials say that in the last two months there have been more than 100 killings in the capital. Scanning still uninvestigated cases of killings, one official said that in the last four days alone there had been 36 reports of new slayings.
While only about 10 percent of those killed have been known as politically active, the official said that "the attaches are just going into the neighborhoods and opening fire to terrorize the population."
 
Preparations Behind Schedule
 Privately, many diplomats say that beyond the climate of violence, they have grown increasingly concerned that preparations for Father Aristide's return are running far behind schedule. Although the settlement of Haiti's crisis negotiated in July in New York called for the stationing of about 1,000 international police and military experts in the country, only a small fraction of that number have arrived.
Diplomats said today that at best, the first sizable contingent, 50 Canadians and 50 French police officers, would arrive within two weeks of a Security Council vote expected this week approving their use. That schedule would leave them only three weeks to begin training and monitoring their Haitian counterparts. Diplomats have said the international agents will not do law-enforcement duty themselves.

HEADLINE: Oregon Quake Jars Buildings And Emotions

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KLAMATH FALLS, Ore., Sept. 21

 BODY:
Most schools and businesses in this farming and timber town of 18,000 people closed today as city workers inspected each building for damage in an earthquake that shook southern Oregon on Monday night.
Centered 15 miles northwest of Klamath Falls, the earthquake, the second in this area in seven months, registered 5.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion and was followed by two aftershocks that witnesses said created a rolling sensation inside buildings. One person died in the initial quake when a boulder fell on a pickup truck. Several building facades fell, bridges cracked, causing roads to be closed, and cars were smashed by falling brick. 
 Gov. Barbara Roberts of Oregon declared a state of emergency in Klamath County. The Mayor of Klamath Falls, Todd Kellstrom, said city officials were still trying to determine the cost of the damage to buildings and businesses. Mr. Kellstrom spent this morning walking around the city and calming residents, some of whom walked the streets carrying cameras and camcorders.
"We've never had an earthquake to my knowledge," Mr. Kellstrom said. "Earthquake preparedness has never been a top issue. But we don't want that kind of talk now. We don't want to scare people any more than they are."
The 5.7 earthquake struck at 8:29 P.M., followed by two large aftershocks and several others throughout the night, ranging from from 4.6 to 5.4 on the Richter scale. In March, an earthquake estimated at 5.3 struck in Woodburn, 250 miles north of here.
Every increase one number on the Richter scale means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus, an earthquake measuring 6, which can cause severe damage, is 10 times greater than one measuring 5, which can cause considerable damage.
Residents of Klamath Falls said it was not the initial, more powerful, jolt that caused most of the damage, but rather the series of aftershocks.
The Klamath Falls Courthouse, City Hall, an apartment building and theater suffered some damaged. The city roped off the downtown area and set up two shelters on Monday night for those who were evacuated from their homes. Some people slept outside, frightened to sleep inside in case of aftershocks.
Kenneth L. Campbell of Phoenix was killed when a 14-foot boulder rolled onto a highway and smashed the truck he was driving. His wife, Phyllis, was riding in the passenger seat but walked away from the accident. An elderly woman died in her home after suffering a heart attack during one of the aftershocks.
In the past several years, geologist studying seismic activity in the Pacific Northwest have said that the area is due for a severe earthquake. In an article that appeared in the journal Science in April 1991, geologists wrote that a fault line in the Pacific Northwest was under increasing pressure. They explained that mountains along the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State were slowly being squeezed together while the coastline was rising. They warned that an earthquake measuring 9.5 -- more than 10 times greater than the devastating San Francisco earthquake of 1906 -- could strike the region, causing the coastal area to drop as much as six feet in minutes, generating huge waves.
But such a cataclysmic event seemed far from people's minds today as they cleaned up broken glass and hired contractors to check the seismic soundness of their homes and workplaces.
Don Hull, the state geologist, said the earthquake on Monday evening appeared to have occurred on a local fault line and not on the "megafault" stretching from Mendocino, Calif., to Vancouver, British Columbia. "The two faults are not connected, and seismic activity on one would not affect the other," said Mr. Hull, who is director of Oregon's geology and mineral industries department.
"Earthquakes of this type are to be expected in the future in the Klamath Falls area," he said. "We've had a very serious and important reminder of the power of earthquakes in Oregon. We're not nearly as well prepared as we should be given the types of earthquakes we expect."
Today, residents walking along the streets of Klamath Falls said they were concerned but did not see that they could do much to prepare for an earthquake.
Describing the quake, Pete Bernett, 17, whose family moved to Klamath Falls three years ago from Pasadena, Calif., said: "The whole house started flopping. I could hear the furnace bouncing underneath the house. We were surprised because everyone said there weren't supposed to be earthquakes here." 
At the Classico Italian Ristorante, the building's brick facade plunged to the ground, smashing a car below. Inside the building, Janet Bumala, a bartender told of holding on to a pipe during the earthquake. "Pots were flying off the stove," Ms. Bumala said. "The ceiling was falling down. Everything got quiet and then we heard a loud noise that sounded like a car wreck."
Nancy Shindler, 45, was at home when the earthquake struck. "The first one felt like a big gust of wind," she said. "The second one felt like living right next to a roller coaster."
Ms. Shindler said she had not made any preparations for an earthquake and did not know if her home would survive a big quake. "We don't really know what to do," she said. "We haven't talked about it because it hadn't been an option before."
As residents and store owners swept up the glass off the streets and checked for structural damage, many said they were uninsured for such a disaster.
Terry Bennett, owner of a shopping center, watched as engineers hammered pillars in her building to decide whether the structure should be condemned. Friends mistaken by the police as looters helped her clean up the store into the early morning hours.
"We usually just worry about strikes and unemployment here," said Ms. Bennett, a resident of Klamath Falls for 20 years. "I used to tell people moving here, you never have to worry about floods or earthquakes here."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Clinton Moves to Assemble Support for His Health Plan

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
President Clinton today put the finishing touches on the health care plan that he hopes will become the crowning achievement of his Presidency. At the same time, he raced to assemble a political coalition to support the plan and won an endorsement from the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Mr. Clinton's proposal to control health costs and guarantee medical care for all Americans represents the biggest initiative in domestic social policy in a half-century. 
 On the eve of a speech by Mr. Clinton to Congress, Administration officials signaled a new willingness to compromise on parts of the President's plan if it did not generate savings as fast as he predicted. This flexibility is likely to please Senate Republicans, who want to delay new health benefits until savings in Medicare and Medicaid are confirmed.
The support of organized labor is indispensable to the success of Mr. Clinton's plan. But the White House never took it for granted and toiled tirelessly to please the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the 14 million members of its affiliated unions.
 
Fearing Cost to Workers
 While many unionized workers already have comprehensive health benefits, labor leaders say they fear that employers will shift more and more costs to workers if Congress does not approve Mr. Clinton's proposal.
With the general outline of Mr. Clinton's plan completed, the Administration focused its attention today on questions about its financing. Economists and members of Congress from both parties are already saying that Mr. Clinton's estimates of potential savings in the health care system are wildly optimistic. They say the plan will not cut health costs, but will increase the Federal budget deficit.
In the face of widespread skepticism, Mr. Clinton and his top aides made strenuous efforts today to defend the numbers in the health plan.
But Leon E. Panetta, the President's budget director, said the Administration was willing to consider "a longer phase-in" for the health plan if necessary to reduce the cost to levels acceptable in Congress.
As for stretching out the transition beyond early 1997, Mr. Panetta said: "You're reducing the benefits in the short term for some, but in the long run everyone's going to get the same benefit. Obviously there's going to be some adjustment on these pieces as we go through the political process."
 
No Compromise on Coverage
 A longer phase-in period would irritate many Democrats to the left of Mr. Clinton. Mindful of such concerns, Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that the Administration would not compromise on the principle of health insurance for all Americans. "We have to have universal coverage as soon as possible," and that means within three years, she said.
Mrs. Clinton said she was willing to stretch out the transition period, if necessary. But Mr. Clinton said, "I'd rather not." The President and his wife made the comments at a luncheon with about 20 journalists.
At a White House briefing, Roger C. Altman, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, said, "If anyone can prove to us that there are flaws in our estimates of the costs of this -- I mean really prove it, which I doubt -- we would make adjustments on the cost side."
But he insisted that Mr. Clinton would not propose new taxes besides those known for months to be under consideration: taxes on cigarettes and perhaps on alcoholic beverages.
 
Deficit or Insurance
 Mr. Panetta said the White House might be willing to forgo some reductions in the Federal budget deficit envisioned in Mr. Clinton's health plan. To health policy experts and economists, one of the least believable parts of the Clinton proposal is his prediction that it will reduce deficits by a total of $91 billion over seven years.
Administration officials suggested today that these savings would be a bargaining chip in negotiations with Congress, which will be forced to choose between deficit reduction and a generous health insurance plan available to all by 1997.
"I think the deficit-reduction number is going to be vulnerable on Capitol Hill," Mr. Panetta said. "The large question for Capitol Hill to answer is, 'Do you want to achieve this much in terms of deficit reduction, or do you want to lessen the amount of deficit reduction and lessen the hit in terms of some of the other programs?' You're going to see some trade-off here."
Administration officials said Mr. Clinton had still not decided whether to propose an increase in taxes on liquor, beer and wine. This decision may not be made before the President's speech on Wednesday, they said. Mr. Clinton refused to tip his hand. "I've never said I would tax any kind of alcohol," he said at lunch today.
 
Total Cost Uncertain
 Asked about this, Mr. Altman said, "I heard someone say the President is upstairs having a drink and cigar and will make that decision shortly."
Mr. Altman, Mr. Panetta and other officials said they still did not know the total cost that would be imposed on businesses, families and households by the President's plan, which would require employers to pay at least 80 percent of health insurance costs for workers.
At a White House briefing today, Mr. Panetta and Mr. Altman, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, and Robert E. Rubin, assistant to the President for economic policy, all defended Mr. Clinton's proposals for financing his health plan. But they have voiced profound doubts about many aspects of the plan in secret deliberations with the President and Mrs. Clinton, Administration officials said.
As labor announced its support, John J. Sweeney, president of the Service Employees International Union, said, "The Clinton plan was enthusiastically and unanimously endorsed today" by the executive council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the governing body of the federation.
While some unions have concerns about specific details, he said, "we believe the President has been bold and courageous in coming forward with this plan, the most comprehensive proposal for health care reform since Harry Truman's day."
Lane Kirkland, president of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, said Mr. Clinton's plan would be good "for working people, good for their families and good for the country."
Mr. Kirkland said the federation would wage a major campaign to win Congressional approval of the Clinton plan. "Of course," he said, "we expect a tough fight. We do not expect those who profit from the inequities of the current health care system to give up their stranglehold without a fight. They may have money, but we've got the people on our side."
Mr. Clinton said his proposal would provide access to abortion for most women. Abortion will not be mentioned explicitly but may be covered under the heading of "pregnancy-related services," he said.
This is the way private insurance policies cover abortion, he said. They do not specify coverage of abortion, brain surgery, appendectomy or any other particular procedure, he said.

HEADLINE: 2 Powerful Democrats Battle Over Transportation Projects

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
The chairmen of two House committees are battling over $305 million in transportation projects that critics call pork and supporters call indispensable.
Representative Bob Carr, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Transportation, touched off the dispute by adding the projects to a $37.7 billion transportation spending bill. 
 In doing so, he enraged Representative Norman Y. Mineta, the California Democrat who heads the Public Works and Transportation Committee, which appropriates the money and is intended to set overall transportation policy.
The lines between the two panels are sometimes blurred.
"These conflicts are not just common, they're endemic, particularly between that committee and subcommittee," said Joseph White, a research associate at the Brookings Institution who is an expert on the appropriations process. "It's common for both chairmen to try to prove their mettle."
 
More for Michigan
 The dispute, expected to reach the House floor on Wednesday, involves 58 projects for highways, bridges, rail crossings and airport runways. Mr. Carr wants to give $109 million, more than one third of the new money, to projects in his home state; the states of other subcommittee members would also benefit.
Financing for the projects would come at the expense of money already earmarked for 41 states. New York, for example, would lose $15 million, New Jersey $8.5 million and Connecticut $6 million. California, Mr. Mineta's state, would lose $11 million.
To Mr. Mineta, Mr. Carr is engaged in a power grab and has violated a House rule against using a money bill to set policy. "There has been no review of all possible projects to determine that these are the best investments we could possibly make," the San Jose Congressman said in a letter to colleagues last month.
To Mr. Carr, Mr. Mineta is battling to preserve his turf at a time when his committee approves a policy bill only every five or six years, while money is appropriated annually. He said his committee conducted hearings on all the projects, and many more.
Both chairmen assumed their positions last January.
"What it boils down to is ego and pride of authorship," Mr. Carr said. "Any policy that impacts on money is of interest to us and is within our jurisdiction."
Mr. Carr said Mr. Mineta had not objected when the Appropriations Committee added money for California. He also noted that states, counties and municipalities sometimes ran out of needed money during the five or six years between authorization bills.
 
Trouble Ahead in Senate
 After criticism of his panel as a pork barrel haven, Mr. Carr in May adopted economic criteria for judging projects. The 58 projects passed a cost-benefit analysis, he said.
Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, the New Jersey Democrat who heads the Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Transportation, said today that he would block Mr. Carr's effort to add projects.
Even if the House approved the projects, Mr. Lautenberg said, "we're going to eliminate them" when the bill goes to a House-Senate conference.

HEADLINE: Ivy League Finds Itself Locked in Bidding War For Prospective Students

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
In the two years since an antitrust action led Ivy League institutions to stop setting common limits on awards to scholarship applicants, the colleges are increasingly being drawn into bidding wars for promising students, officials say.
A student can now receive financial aid offers that vary as much as $5,000 from college to college in the Ivy League. "We have certainly seen in the past two years more instances of significant divergences in financial aid awards," said James O. Freedman, the president of Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H. "What it does to us is a student calls us up and says, 'This institution gave me $2,000 or $4,000 or $5,000 more than you did.' That rarely happened before." 
 It was in part to avoid this that in the 1950's the colleges began sharing information about the most promising students and agreeing to fix the amount of scholarship aid. The practice, which also included the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was called "overlapping" and was accomplished through quarterly meetings of college financial officers. For many students, the amount of aid is a major factor in deciding to attend one of the eight Ivy League institutions, where tuition is the highest in the nation, averaging $25,000 this year.
But two years ago, faced with an antitrust action from the Justice Department, the colleges signed a consent decree in which they pledged to abandon the practice. Only M.I.T. refused to go along, contending that the Sherman Antitrust Act's prohibition of corporate price fixing should not apply to institutions of higher learning. Rather, it said, laws governing charitable institutions should apply. The goal of the scholarship meetings, it contended, was to spread resources more equitably and insure that there was enough scholarship money for poor and minority students.
 
Support From Appeals Court
 Until last week, it appeared that the university's argument, and more than $1 million in legal fees, had gone for naught. A Federal District Court had supported the Justice Department, but last week the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia, gave M.I.T.'s contention new life, sending it back to the lower court for a new trial. The appeals court included an instruction that the university be permitted to make its case that it should be treated as a charitable institution.
The Ivy League universities were buoyed by the decision, even as they continued to adhere to the consent decree. Officials at most institutions said yesterday that they hoped the courts would ultimately back the overlapping practice. They added that they were still reviewing the court's opinion.
"We are happy that the court remanded the case back to the lower court," said Jon New, a spokesman for Harvard University who declined to make further comment on the decision. He said Harvard officials were studying the ruling to determine "what steps we will take."
But the Ivy League institutions lamented that as more students and parents began to understand the consent decree and became more sophisticated in shopping for the best financial aid package, an unprecedented wave of competition for financial assistance had resulted.
 
Seeking Market Forces
 The Justice Department, in arguing against the practice of overlapping, had contended that financial aid awards granted under it were essentially a form of price fixing. The scholarships were discounts from tuition, the department said, and it argued that the price of tuition should be set by market forces.
Some financial-aid experts have asserted that the benefits of such market competition should be available, particularly as the cost of a four-year college education continues to rise.
Student shopping for the best aid packages has been common for years among major public universities and the so-called public Ivies, like the University of Michigan, the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Texas at Austin.
In a study released yesterday by the College Board, tuition rates rose by nearly twice the rate of inflation last year. Four-year private institutions charged about 6 percent more, with the national average being $11,025. Four-year public institutions charged about 8 percent more, for a national average of $2,527.
 
Same Pool of Students
 The Ivy League institutions -- Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Princeton, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania -- compete in the same pool of the nation's brightest students. They argue that the heightened competitiveness for bigger financial aid awards has been detrimental to both the colleges and their potential students.
In the last school year, Princeton University outspent its financial aid budget by $100,000 in part because of higher costs and the added dimension of students shopping for the best aid packages.
Princeton's total financial aid package, including scholarships, loans and work-study programs, for the average student receiving financial aid increased to $13,635 in the last school year, up from $13,136 the year before. The cost of tuition, room and board rose to $24,650 for the 1993-94 school year, up from $23,267 the year before. Other institutions reported similar increases, reflecting the increased comparison shopping by students and their families.
"Frequently when people come to this issue of students' and parents' shopping around, the question is, 'Well, isn't this just all to the good?' " said Robert Durkee, vice president for public affairs at Princeton. "The problem is that resources are finite.
"And so if one student gets more aid, then that money has to come from someplace else. And frequently it comes from awards that you can make to other students. That's why institutions have been concerned about these additional awards above need."

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Pal, Teacher and Now Power Broker: A Gathering Force of One at Pentagon

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
A combination of necessity and personal connections has suddenly transformed a little-known chemistry professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology into one of the most influential powerbrokers at the Pentagon.
Saddled with the deceptively bland title of Under Secretary of Defense for acquisition and technology, the official, John M. Deutch has parlayed his scientific sophistication and his longtime friendship with Defense Secretary Les Aspin into a role as the Pentagon's point man on issues from base closings and nuclear testing to military industry conversion. As the Pentagon's chief of acquisitions, Mr. Deutch (pronounced doych) is nominally responsible for overseeing the Pentagon's annual budget of about $100 billion for weapons and equipment -- out of a total military budget of $273 billion this year -- as well as nearly 800 scientists, engineers, logisticians and weapons experts. 
 But when the Administration delayed filling a raft of senior civilian posts at the Pentagon, Mr. Aspin repeatedly heaped new chores on his old college friend. "In bureaucratic terms, Deutch is the ink blot who's expanded in the power vacuum," said a senior House Democratic aide.
 
More Duties, in Tokyo
 Mr. Deutch, a 55-year-old former top Energy Department official, broadened his portfolio a bit more this week when he traveled to Tokyo to discuss sharing America's ballistic missile defense technology. Japan is deeply concerned over North Korea's recent test-launching of a long-range nuclear missile.
Later this month, a review board headed by Mr. Deutch is expected to decide the fate of the C-17, a new $40 billion cargo plane plagued by cost overruns and technical flaws. And in October, Mr. Deutch will oversee long-range budget plans from each of the military services to insure that they conform with the Administration's overall post-cold war military blueprint.
Mr. Deutch's style is hardly professorial. He is loud, brash and confrontational and has set out to shake up the Pentagon bureaucracy. "I found the C-17 to be an egregious example of poor management in the program," Mr. Deutch said in typically blunt fashion during a recent interview. "This program is in very deep trouble."
But then his academic roots have long reached deeply into the Federal Government: M.I.T. has for decades been so close to the military that some have called it a Pentagon farm team. While generally unknown outside policy circles, Mr. Deutch has been a familiar Washington insider for decades.
 
McNamara 'Whiz Kid'
 He has bounced between M.I.T. and Democratic administrations since he joined the Pentagon in 1961 as one of Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara's original "whiz kids." Along the way he has gotten to know many who have gone on to top jobs in Washington, like the Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey Jr., a longtime friend.
As the No. 3 official at the Department of Energy under President Jimmy Carter, Mr. Deutch ran all Federal energy research laboratories, and he commissioned a study on the physical condition and management of Government-operated nuclear installations after the disaster at the commercial power plant at Three Mile Island, Pa.
Some friends say Mr. Deutch, who was a finalist to be Secretary of Energy in the Bush Administration, was disappointed he was not offered a Cabinet post this time around. But associates say he is carving out a huge power base in his new job by combining his technical prowess, policymaking experience and close ties to Mr. Aspin and the Deputy Defense Secretary, William J. Perry.
In high-level meetings, the two friends call each other "Aspin" and "Deutch," just as they have since their graduate school days at M.I.T. 30 years ago. As students, Mr. Deutch said, they ate dinner together almost every night, furiously debating public policy into the wee hours.
Associates say Mr. Aspin and Mr. Perry are the intellectual drivers behind Pentagon policy while Mr. Deutch puts the policy into practice. "Les Aspin will have lots of good ideas and Bill Perry is a good strategic thinker, but Deutch is the guy who works out the details and bangs heads together," said Harold Brown, a former Defense Secretary who has known Mr. Deutch for three decades.
In their Pentagon incarnations, Mr. Deutch and Mr. Aspin differ little on goals, Mr. Aspin says. "We substantively want to get to the same place, and if there's any difference, maybe it's in the tactics," he said in an interview, without elaborating.
While Mr. Deutch is admired for his technical understanding of issues and their policy implications, some colleagues say he may be too inclined to reach decisions without fully weighing the potential political damage.
"Government has become more political," Mr. Deutch said, acknowledging the criticism indirectly. "There's a great deal more distrust of Government. Special interests are more intense, and it's a lot harder to get consensus on where the country should be moving."
 
'A Powerful Personality'
 Mr. Deutch can be impatient and abrupt, associates say; during the drafting of the Pentagon's comprehensive long-range plan, which he directed, he was known to race ahead of briefings that did not move along quickly enough.
"John has a very powerful personality, and people who aren't real sure of themselves may feel he is too domineering," Mr. Woolsey said.
Indeed, if Mr. Deutch were a fighter pilot, his call sign would be "Intensity." His tennis games with Mr. Aspin are legendary. ("He's never beaten me and never will," Mr. Deutch said, beaming.)
Even at casual gatherings, friends say standard Washington shoptalk often gives way to Mr. Deutch's latest scientific interest. "If you're ever invited to a barbecue at Deutch's house, the discussion afterward will inevitably turn from politics to more heavy subjects, like techniques for measuring the weight of air," said Rudy de Leon, a top aide to Mr. Aspin.
But his ability to converse as easily in arcane science as in arcane policy has only increased Mr. Deutch's currency with Mr. Aspin. The Defense Secretary chose Mr. Deutch to be the Pentagon's chief advocate for continuing underground nuclear tests for safety purposes.
 
Confident on His Feet
 After Mr. Aspin's presentation of the Pentagon's long-range review early this month, Mr. Deutch stepped up to give more details at a news conference. Nimbly fielding questions, Mr. Deutch all but shunted aside his partner at the lecturn, Adm. David E. Jeremiah, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Such decisiveness has endeared him to Mr. Aspin, who agonizes over difficult choices. Mr. Deutch will need to marshal all his moxie to meet his most daunting challenge: overhauling the Pentagon's cumbersome and inefficient system of buying weapons and equipment.
The Pentagon has promised to simplify the acquisition process and encourage the use of commercial products and technologies instead of products custom-designed for military needs. "As the defense budget goes down, we don't have the luxury anymore to have separate industrial bases" for the military and the commercial sector, Mr. Deutch said.
Previous Administrations have tried, and largely failed, to streamline the weapons-buying system, running into resistance from the military industry and the Pentagon bureaucracy itself.
So how will this Administration succeed where others have stumbled? "There's a necessity to find the economies which will accomplish acquisition reform that wasn't required in the great expansion of defense budgets in the 1980's," Mr. Deutch said.
Industry executives express concern that Mr. Deutch and other top Pentagon brass lack strong industrial management experience. Mr. Deutch's appointed deputy, R. Noel Longuemare, is a vice president at Westinghouse Electric, but he has not been confirmed by the Senate.
The Administration's new long-range plan for the armed services encourages the military industry to consolidate. But the Pentagon will also keep buying certain advanced weapons, like tanks and nuclear submarines, even if they are not needed, in order to preserve critical technologies for the future.
"I'm worried that their defense conversion effort is too fragmented, too bureaucratic and out of whack with reality," said Bernard L. Schwartz, the chief executive of the Loral Corporation, a large military contractor.
 
Family Fled the Nazis
 Then again, difficult military challenges run in Mr. Deutch's family. Born in Brussels, Mr. Deutch and his family fled ahead of the invading Nazis, first to France and eventually to the United States. His father, an electrical engineer, became the deputy director of America's synthetic rubber program in World War II.
Mr. Deutch attended a private school in Washington before graduating from Amherst College and M.I.T. Between his stints in Government, Mr. Deutch returned to M.I.T. as a chemistry professor and eventually as provost. Friends say a major career disappointment came when Mr. Deutch was passed over to be M.I.T.'s president in 1990.
Divorced with three grown sons, Mr. Deutch now lives in suburban Maryland and has a cottage on Cape Cod. In his Senate confirmation hearings, he said he planned to return to M.I.T. when he leaves the Pentagon.
"I can't maintain many years in Washington without going back to get recharged," he said.

HEADLINE: Whitman Economist Has Reagan Credentials

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
In choosing Lawrence Kudlow to help create her economic plan, Christine Todd Whitman landed a swashbuckling Reagan-era economist who pitches Cadillacs on television and who is eager to try in New Jersey the supply-side economics he alternately embraced and rejected during his tenure in the White House.
Mr. Kudlow, now chief economist of Bear, Stearns & Company, is one of the two architects of an economic revival plan released today by Mrs. Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor of New Jersey. Along with Malcolm Forbes Jr., president of Forbes Inc. and editor in chief of Forbes magazine, Mr. Kudlow helped Mrs. Whitman put together a plan based on the supply-side theory that the best way to stimulate a stagnant economy is by cutting taxes. 
 "Shock therapy," Mr. Kudlow said.
 
The Same Philosophy
 Mr. Kudlow preached the same philosophy when he became deputy budget director under David Stockman during Ronald Reagan's first term as President. But shortly after landing the job, Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Stockman eased off of their supply-side proposals. They advised Mr. Reagan to scale back his tax cuts and to stretch them out over a longer period of time.
"Reagan and the supply-siders believed that cutting taxes first would force spending cuts," Mr. Kudlow said in 1984. "The theory was wrong."
But today Mr. Kudlow said that as governor of New Jersey, Mrs. Whitman would have some things President Reagan did not -- a line-item veto and the power to impound appropriations. In effect, the governor of New Jersey can simply refuse to provide funds for any program, salary or agency he or she chooses. Mrs. Whitman said she would use that power to trim $250 million from the state's 1993-94 budget within her first six months in office.
"If we had that kind of authority I believe we could have made a much bigger dent in Federal spending," Mr. Kudlow said. "Of course, Christie doesn't have to deal with the former Soviet Union in building up the defense budget."
 
'He's Into Power'
 Mr. Kudlow, a graduate of Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, is an impeccable dresser and chain-smoker who appears frequently on television business programs and has pitched Cadillacs for a local automobile dealer. Even his friends say he is more salesman than economic theorist.
"He's into power," said Jude Wanniski, a business consultant and one of the original supply-siders, who has known Mr. Kudlow for 20 years. "He wants to be a celebrity. He's a swashbuckler, a car salesman, a gunslinger. But it's hard to be angry at the guy."
For all his flamboyance, Mr. Kudlow is adept at forecasting, at least in the short term. He correctly foresaw the 1990-91 national recession when conventional wisdom predicted there would be no recession. And he foresaw the start of the end of the recession in the spring of 1991, when most other economists said the economy was still heading downward.
Mr. Kudlow said he met Mrs. Whitman last spring after her successful primary battle and agreed to be co-chairman of her Council for Economic Recovery.
"This was not going to be tinkering around the edges," he said. "I said, Christie, you're going to have to cut income taxes.' She said fine, that was her instinct too."

HEADLINE: SCHOLAR WHO SUED WINS $1.2 MILLION

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS

 BODY:
A Michigan judge ordered the University of Michigan yesterday to pay $1.2 million in damages to a scientist after a jury found that her supervisor had stolen credit for her research and that the university had failed to investigate properly.
The civil case is believed to be the first in which shortcomings in a university's inquiry into an accusation of scientific misconduct brought a large court award, and university officials say they are worried that it may encourage similar lawsuits. Judge Patrick J. Conlin of the Michigan Court of Claims in Washtenaw County issued the order yesterday and is expected to enter it officially today. 
 The suit was brought by Dr. Carolyn Phinney, a research psychologist who had worked on how to define wisdom and measure its accumulation as people age. She conducted interviews in which she asked subjects whom they considered wise and what qualified those on their lists. She found that wise people are commonly identified as those who avoid unwise and destructive actions.
 
Grant Application at Issue
 But Dr. Phinney contended that her supervisor, Dr. Marion Perlmutter, then a senior scientist in the university's Institute of Gerontology, took the work and submitted it for Federal grants for herself without naming Dr. Phinney as a principal investigator.
A university investigation did not determine whether Dr. Perlmutter was guilty of misconduct. Instead, Dr. Richard Adelman, director of the Institute of Gerontology, decided first to appoint colleagues of Dr. Perlmutter to investigate, then to end the investigation and order the two scientists to negotiate an agreement. Both sides refused. Dr. Adelman then suspended Dr. Phinney, whose contract was subsequently not renewed. She is currently unemployed.
Dr. Phinney sued Dr. Perlmutter, Dr. Adelman and the university.
A seven-person jury decided unanimously in May that Dr. Perlmutter had committed fraud in taking credit for the work and that Dr. Adelman had violated a Michigan law in retaliating against Dr. Phinney instead of properly investigating the case.
 
Jury Set Damage Amount
 The jury recommended damages of $130,000 for Dr. Perlmutter's actions and $989,000 for Dr. Adelman's actions. Judge Conlin ordered those amounts to be paid, adding about $100,000 in interest charges.
The university has not decided whether to appeal to the state supreme court. But a university spokesman, Walter Harrison, said the university considered its investigation of the matter sufficient. Mr. Harrison said he was speaking for the university employees who had been sued.
It is the university that is liable for damages.
Susan Knapp, director of publications at the American Psychological Association, who helped write the association's standards for giving credit to scientists, said the Michigan case was important because it was a sign that whistle-blowers and junior faculty members could win a significant case against a university.
She said she believed that the practice in science that has permitted senior authors to take much credit for scientific work merely because they hold the title of chairman or director was now being seriously questioned. Ethics standards issued by the association in recent months state that senior scientists are not entitled to be named as authors of scientific papers merely because of their jobs.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Outlines Plan for Future Economic Growth

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
Trying to position himself as an incumbent candidate for change -- a challenging political proposition -- Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday sketched a broad blueprint for future economic growth in New York City, saying he would create 110,000 new private-sector jobs if elected to a second term.
For Mr. Dinkins, who has steadfastly insisted that his administration bore little responsibility for the recession that has cost the city more than 350,000 jobs since 1989, the plan was a sharp departure. He is now stressing job creation instead of job retention. 
 Yesterday, the Mayor proposed targeting a dozen industries with potential for growth -- including recycling, computer software and biotechnology -- and fueling their expansion through two new development funds, using public and private money, and by creating centers to nurture critical industries. The largest single program would be a $250 million economic development bank financed through the city's capital budget to help larger companies expand and to attract new businesses to New York.
The plan was praised by some business leaders. But it was denounced by the Mayor's political opponents and even by a prominent fellow Democrat, Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn, who dismissed the initiative as a political ploy and called it "too little, too late."
"We should have been doing this long before now, not waiting until an election time," Mr. Golden said immediately after the speech.
Mr. Golden, who also made clear that he was dissatisfied with the Mayor -- in part, by a Dinkins administration plan to move a police car pound from Whitestone, Queens, to the Brooklyn waterfront -- said he had not yet decided whom to endorse in the mayoral race.
Throughout the campaign, the Mayor has insisted that he should not be blamed for the job loss in the city because the recession was a national phenomenon. It might be difficult, a Democratic member of the City Council said yesterday, for the Mayor to argue now that he will be responsible for 110,000 new private-sector jobs over the next four years.
Mr. Dinkins suggested in his speech at the Metrotech Center in downtown Brooklyn that it was only now, when the national recession has ebbed and its effect in New York seems to be diminishing, that it made sense to commit substantial amounts of public money to stimulate the expansion of a dozen selected segments of the local economy.
Barry F. Sullivan, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said the city had been forced to take a defensive approach to jobs over the last four years, trying to keep companies in New York that contemplated moving elsewhere.
"It seems to us that now is the time to go on the offense," Mr. Sullivan said in an interview. "The fact that it's political season is in this sense coincidental. We've been working on this for about a year."
The plan, devised by a group of economic-development specialists working under Mr. Sullivan, calls for centers to help along e technological developments in critical industries, including computer software companies, biotechnology concerns and fashion design companies.
It was unclear who would pay for creation of the centers or how much they would cost. But the Mayor did propose establishing funds to help these and other industries to grow. For example, an advanced technology venture capital fund, under his plan, would have a total of $60 million. Of that, $10 million would come from the city, $10 million from private business and $40 million from Federal funds under the Small Business Investment Corporation program.
The proposed fund for job development in small and mid-sized businesses would also total $60 million and would use the same formula as the venture capital fund. Mr. Sullivan said the city's contributions would come from the operating budget; such money has not yet been appropriated and would require approval by the City Council.
The $250 million economic development bank would be financed by the city capital budget, Mr. Sullivan said. Because of the fiscal strains caused by the recession, the city has been cutting back the size of the capital budget in recent years. Mr. Dinkins would no doubt have to cancel or postpone some rebuilding projects to free up capital money for the proposed development bank.
"The plan you have in your hands is the real thing," the Mayor said in his speech. Then he took a jab at his Republican-Liberal opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani. "It doesn't promise what it can't deliver," he said. "And we won't change our minds 10 times after the 10 o'clock news."
Christyne Lategano, Mr. Giuliani's press secretary, was similarly dismissive of the Mayor's proposal. "It's not a credible plan," she said. "Under Dinkins, New York City lost nearly 400,000 private-sector jobs and crushed small businesses with onerous fines and fees. He blames Reagan and Bush; he blames everyone but himself. He needs to stop playing the blame game and he needs to take responsibility."
"To target anything with 42 days left to the election is basically a joke," Ms. Lategano added.
Ronald K. Shelp, president of New York City Chamber of Commerce and Industry, called the Mayor's plan innovative. Mr. Shelp said that Mr. Dinkins had singled out the right industries for growth and that few if any cities had ever tried to create their own industrial development policies. But he said he did not know if the city could buck national and international economic trends on its own.
"We won't know until it's tried," Mr. Shelp said. "I think it's worth trying because we've got a trend: we've got a declining economy."

HEADLINE: Lending Plan Clears Senate Panel

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
The Senate Banking Committee today approved the Clinton Administration's program for spurring lending in poor communities, adding provisions to make borrowing by small businesses easier and to protect consumers from exploitation by home-equity lenders.
Some Republicans expressed doubts over the plan, pushed by the Clinton Administration to fulfill a campaign promise to provide seed money for unconventional lenders that make loans in poor communities where regular bankers are reluctant to lend. 
 But they went along with the plan in part because it also included provisions drafted by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, the panel's ranking Republican, to help create a secondary market in which loans to small businesses could be bundled and resold.
 
 
Reaction From Consumer Groups
 Consumer groups said the provisions to discourage home-equity lending abuses were a step in the right direction, although such provisions had been watered down somewhat.
The package was approved nearly unanimously, over the sole dissent of Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, who said its loan subsidies and usury limits represented a financial philosophy that had been "rejected all over the world except in North Korea and Cuba."
At the heart of the package is the Clinton Administration's proposal to spend $382 million over four years to promote the formation and expansion of community development financial institutions geared toward lending in low-income areas.
The most debated aspect of the program was whether to allow regular banks to qualify for Federal capital grants of up to $5 million that would be handed out to financial institutions specializing in community development, like community development loan funds and credit unions.
 
 
Clinton Proposal
 The Clinton Administration, in its proposal, had ruled out letting regular banks qualify for the subsidies through their specialized community development subsidiaries, which some banks use to make loans to poor borrowers. Such loans help banks comply with terms of the Community Reinvestment Act, a longstanding obligation.
The bill approved today would allow community development subsidiaries partly owned by regular banks or savings and loans to qualify for the subsidies, as long as no one company owns more than 25 percent of a single community development institution.
The question of letting ordinary banks participate directly in the program will arise again in the House, which has yet to draft its own version of the bill.
 
 
One House Plan
 Representative Floyd H. Flake, a Queens Democrat, and Representative Tom Ridge, a Pennsylvania Republican, are pushing a plan that would expand the program further by reducing the deposit insurance premiums paid by banks if they expand their community development lending. This approach is permitted under existing law, but money has never been made available to offset the premiums.
Other members of the House Banking Committee, however, have opposed that approach and have favored the Administration's original bill, which allows the subsidies only for banks whose primary purpose is lending in distressed communities.
The Senate bill's provisions to expand small business lending are viewed as a major change in existing law that may have far-reaching consequences. The idea is that banks will more willingly lend to small businesses if they can then sell the loans to other investors, who would buy interests in packages of loans in much the same way that home mortgages are currently bundled and resold.
 
 
Removing Regulations
 The approach conceived by Senator D'Amato accomplishes this by removing regulatory obstacles, not by setting up any new quasi-Government agency like those that sponsor secondary markets in mortgages and other financial instruments.
The provisions cracking down on abuses in home-equity lending are a response to hearings in which lawmakers were told of lenders making credit available at extremely high interest rates or with other onerous expenses, using a borrower's home as equity. When the borrower could not repay the loans, the lenders would foreclose on the property.
The bill would apply to loans charging interest rates of more than 10 percentage points above Treasury interest rates for securities of comparable maturity, or with initial points and fees of more than $400 or 8 percent of the loan's value, whichever is greater.
In such cases, lenders would have to provide special disclosures making clear the risks to the borrowers, disclosing the monthly costs and other loan features at least three days before the loan was completed.
But consumer groups said these provisions did not go far enough, especially since they did not apply to home equity lines of credit, in which the loan is not necessarily provided in a lump sum but can be borrowed in pieces up to a fixed limit.

HEADLINE: August Housing Starts Surged to 3 1/2-Year High

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Housing starts bounced back in August after an early summer slump to the highest level in three and a half years, the Government reported today.
Starts of new homes and apartments jumped 7.8 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.32 million in August, the highest since a 1.44 million rate in February 1990, the Commerce Department reported today. 
 It was the biggest increase since housing starts advanced 11.1 percent a year earlier. Starts were up in every region except for the Northeast, where the drop was the first in five months.
Economists said the surge was stimulated by low mortgage rates. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.11 percent during August. The average rate was 6.96 percent last week, near a 25-year low and below 7 percent for a fourth straight week.
 
Low Rates 'the Dominant Factor'
 "Clearly the interest rates were the dominant factor," said David F. Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders. "Job growth is still slow. Household formation is still slow."
Earlier in the summer, housing starts fell 1.7 percent in July after remaining flat in June. So far this year, the rate is 3.2 percent higher than it was for the first eight months of 1992.
The White House press secretary, Dee Dee Myers, said, "One month does not a trend make, but this is the first real sign that lower interest rates and lower prices seem to have a positive impact on the housing industry."
Economists expect interest rates to remain low in the months ahead. Federal Reserve policy makers were meeting privately today. Analysts believe that the Fed will decide to hold short-term rates steady because inflation remains in check and the economy continues to grow modestly.
Despite low mortgage rates, sales of new homes fell in July for the second time in three months. On the other hand, sales of previously owned homes, which are generally less expensive, rose for four months through July.
 
Permits Up
 A rise in applications for permits to build homes showed builders were optimistic about sales in August. Applications increased 7.5 percent for the month, to a 1.25 million rate, the highest level since 1.33 million in February 1990 and the second straight advance.
Mr. Seiders and other analysts predicted housing starts would stay near the August level the rest of the year. If so, they would total 1.24 million by the end of the year, up from 1.20 million in 1992 and 1.01 million in 1991.
Starts of single-family homes jumped 11 percent in August, to a 1.18 million rate, the highest since 1.23 million in September 1987.
Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, said the single-family sector was "really the only sector in which we can expect strength in the near future."
"The multifamily sector is still having to deal with the fact that we have a large inventory overhang of apartment buildings and therefore high vacancy rates among renters," he said.
Still, starts of multifamily housing rose 6.7 percent in August, to a rate of 143,000. Starts of apartments with five or more units rose 2.6 percent. Mr. Seiders attributed the gain to the restoration in August of a Federal tax credit for low-income housing.

HEADLINE: More Saving Is Urged

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
Baby boomers must put away far more savings to insure a comfortable retirement, a Congressional panel was told today.
"The average baby boomer must triple his or her rate of savings to avoid a precipitous decline of living standards during retirement," Douglas Bernheim, a Princeton economics professor, told the House Ways and Means Committee's subcommittee on social security. 
 Professor Bernheim's findings contradict a recent study by the Congressional Budget Office that said baby boomers in educated, two-income families would be better off in retirement than their parents.
Many researchers have questioned whether there will be enough private and public resources to take care of the baby boomers -- roughly 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964 -- when they begin retiring early in the next century.
The budget office director, Robert D. Reischauer, told the subcommittee that the Congressional study dispelled some of the "scare rhetoric" about the baby boom generation.
But Professor Bernheim said the budget office report failed to consider differences in the economic climates experienced by baby boomers and their parents.
To maintain their standard of living after retirement, baby boomers must save more than their parents did at the same age, Professor Bernheim said. That is partly because they cannot expect their earnings to grow as rapidly as their parents' earnings did. Also, many boomers are having children later than their parents had, leaving less time after the child-rearing years to save money.

HEADLINE: BACKSTAGE WITH: Kurt Masur;
Politics, Podiums And a Maestro's Two Homes

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
HANGING on the wall above the stage-door guard's desk at Avery Fisher Hall in Lincoln Center are a good-luck horseshoe, a smallish American flag and a black-and-white photograph of Kurt Masur.
Mr. Masur, the bearlike German conductor whose off-the-podium trademark is a bolo tie, is no longer a visitor in New York. Upstairs in his office yesterday, he was eating takeout chili and talking about old movies he watches on his big-screen projection television. Tonight, he will begin his third season as the music director of the hometown orchestra, the New York Philharmonic. But he has not forgotten his first impressions of an intimidating city. 
 "Guest conducting, I felt lost here," he said. "You are surrounded by a lot of people, but you can feel very lonesome. I started thinking, 'How to meet those people, how to build concerts so people will know the Philharmonic plays for everybody, not just those with lots of money.' "
Looking across the room toward the garretlike floor-to-ceiling window, Mr. Masur said he had warmed to New York, now his home for five months of the year. He is juggling two orchestras: besides the Philharmonic, he remains the music director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus in Germany. But on this afternoon, 36 hours before the first downbeat of the Philharmonic's season, he jumps from topic to topic, from how he once tried to get the composer Dmitri Shostakovich to change a single word in a chorus (Shostakovich said no) to how Mr. Masur's two cities have common problems: the homeless, the unemployed. "It seems nobody has a solution anywhere," he said.
He has squeezed his 6-foot-plus frame into a small chair, and his voice is quieter than it is when he is commanding the Philharmonic at rehearsal. Of course, his office, with its black leather sofa and medium-size Steinway, is smaller than the 2,800-seat Avery Fisher Hall; with the season about to begin, it still looks a bit unlived-in. His English is occasionally less than perfect, and he struggles to translate a German word or two, but there is no disguising his warmth for the musicians in the Philharmonic.
"I never wanted to change the orchestra," he said. "I thought I knew the orchestra before I came and thought I knew beneath the surface that this orchestra could only earn respect for what they do. What we could build is trust between the leading people: management, myself and the orchestra."
And so he has made the Philharmonic, once the orchestra of Gustav Mahler, Arturo Toscanini and Leonard Bernstein, his own, from top to bottom. On the stage are acoustical baffles he demanded, to improve the hall's murky sound. He has also scheduled "rush hour concerts" with a 6:45 P.M. starting time, for commuters too impatient to wait for the Philharmonic's 8 P.M. curtain.
In addition, he scheduled a series of forums at which anyone in the audience could ask him a question, no topic off-limits. One man asked what Mr. Masur could do to bring peace to Crown Heights, the Brooklyn neighborhood where violence erupted between blacks and Hasidic Jews a few weeks before Mr. Masur's first concert in 1991. (He says he cannot remember the answer he gave.)
He himself is a commuter. He lives in Rye, N.Y., with his wife, the violist and soprano Tomoko Sakurai, and their 16-year-old son, Ken David. Mr. Masur rides to rehearsals in a chauffeur-driven sedan and spends the time on the telephone to the Gewandhaus, "ruling Leipzig from a car," he says with a hint of a smile. He arrived on Monday to find new carpet in the aisles at Avery Fisher and fresh off-white paint in the lobby (no more dark brown walls).
Watching him rehearse is like watching a one-man aerobics class: he works up a sweat and changes shirts during rehearsal breaks every hour or so. Sometimes he talks over the orchestra, counting rhythms aloud like a piano teacher urging a student on before the big recital: "One AND two AND one AND two."
Sometimes he puts words of a kind to the music. On Monday afternoon he sang the opening chords to Beethoven's Overture to "Fidelio" like this: "SMET-a-na! SMET-a-na! SMET-a-na's my name!"
The point was the accents in a piece the orchestra had played dozens of times before. "If you do not do something fresh," he said, "it is like you are reading too fast and skipping over words, and that is just no good."
He was something of a surprise choice when the Philharmonic named him to succeed Zubin Mehta in April 1990. For 20 years he had been the music director of the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, a post that had once belonged to Mendelssohn. But beyond Leipzig, he was perhaps better known for his role in the democratization of the old East Germany as the Communist order collapsed. In that country's last few months he was mentioned as a candidate for president.
He is once again the subject of political speculation. His name appeared in press reports last month as a possible candidate for the presidency of Germany. Even Deborah Borda, the Philharmonic's managing director, could not resist teasing him about the rumors. At the season's first rehearsal, on Monday, she introduced him as "President Masur."
Now, as then, he maintains that it is not a job he wants.
"I answered this in 1990," he says. "Now I have one more reason: I am happy with two of the best orchestras of the world. And there is no reason to go into politics because I believe I can't change anything anymore."
He continued: "There's only one positive point in that, that people are trusting musicians. That's a good sign. This is coming from people who're tired, tired of power plays by politicians forgetting people. There's nobody like Clinton, who's younger, trying something new. In that direction, Germans are jealous of Americans' taking some risks."
But a day with Mr. Masur in New York is not about politics. And before long he was back on the podium, rehearsing again. The orchestra will play four concerts in the next six days, starting with tonight's televised concert. His programs are more varied than some Americans expected from a conductor who had spent so much of his career in Europe, in a city Bach called home. This year he will conduct everything from a world premiere of symphony by Alfred Schnittke to the Mahler's Ninth Symphony.
On nights the Philharmonic has off, Mr. Masur makes the rounds of everything from other classical concerts to jazz clubs like Michael's Pub, where Woody Allen sometimes sits in as a clarinetist. His son plays the piano and is learning the trumpet. "He's doing jazz also," Mr. Masur said, "so at home I listen to everything."
With his wife, they sometimes have family chamber concerts. (Mr. Masur has four older children from two previous marriages.) And on his giant television, they watch movies. One favorite, he said, is an old German movie about Johann Sebastian Bach's son Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, also a composer.
In juggling his two orchestras, Mr. Masur said, he had had to learn that being a music director in the United States is different from in Europe. In Europe, if the scheduled time for a break comes when the orchestra is five bars from the end of a piece, they stay on and work out the five bars. Here, under the musicians' contract with the orchestra, they stop.
In Lepizig, he has a say in every usher who is hired, every paycheck that goes out, duties that American orchestras leave to administrators. Mr. Masur says it is not completely different. "I'm interested in everything," he said. "Deborah Borda talks to me about her artistic impressions. I talk about how it's going in business. Of course, there in Leipzig, everyone expects me to say this or this or that, but I never do it alone. We have very democratic kinds of decisions.
"Very often if there are problems with conductors and an orchestra, it's not a mistake of both parties, it could be the mistake of management, trying to split them both, expecting the conductor would not care about the social problems of the musicians." He said he could succeed only if the musicians "feel I accept them as partners." If he had a cold relationship with the orchestra members, he said, "I couldn't live with it."

HEADLINE: Eating Well

BYLINE: By Marian Burros

 BODY:
"AT $5 a box I'm not going to buy any of those," said the woman who was poring over the shelves of cold cereals at a supermarket. "I'm going to stick with oatmeal."
She was reflecting a growing sentiment among shoppers that cold cereals, as well as many other brand-name products, cost too much. And they are registering their disapproval in numerous ways: switching to other brands or waiting for coupons and two-for-one offers that reduce the cost by as much as $1. 
 More often than in the past, shoppers are turning to supermarket brands, rather than those of some national company. The reason is simple: the difference in price between the private-label brand and the national-brand of cereal is significant: often more than a $1 a pound.
What everyone wants to know is whether the lower price affects the nutritional quality or the taste.
The answer is no.
As the shopper of the 80's who rarely looked at a price tag has given way to the shopper of the 90's who wants to know what everything costs, cereals that sell for more than boneless chicken breasts, or even some cuts of beef, are being scrutinized. Cereal prices rose 71 percent between 1983 and 1991, almost double the 37 percent increase in food prices in general, according to the Food Marketing Policy Center of the University of Connecticut at Storrs.
Sales of private-label cereals increased 6 percent between 1991 and 1992, from 171 million boxes of cereal to 181 million boxes, according to the Private Label Manufacturers Association in New York. Sales of national brands went up less -- by 4 percent -- but the disparity in market share is still enormous. In 1992, 2.4 billion boxes of brand-name cereals were sold.
Although private-label brands still represent a tiny part of overall cereal sales, the industry is worried, and there is talk about the plight of national brands. In a column in the July 26 issue of Supermarket News, David Merrefield wrote, "There's ample reason to acknowledge that brands are under increasing pressure and that low-overhead private labels are in ascendancy."
Researchers say that the retail price of a box of a national-brand cereal is more than double the actual cost of producing it and that 15 to 20 percent of the retail price is profit to the manufacturer. For years supermarket chains have carried private-label brands for everything from coffee to toilet paper, but their general reputation was that they were lower-quality imitations of national brands.
In recent years there have been efforts to upgrade the quality of the private-label offerings, in some instances even making them premium quality, and today it is almost impossible to tell the difference between a private-label cold cereal and its national-brand counterpart.
Many supermarket chains have several private-label brands of the most popular cereals like corn flakes and Rice Krispies. In the last few years the Kroger supermarket chain has expanded its line of store-brand cereals from 6 or 8 to 22. Paul Bernish, a company spokesman, said sales so far this year are 28 percent ahead of 1992, with gains for all but one of the private-label cereals.
Jeffrey Nedelman, the vice president for public affairs at the Grocery Manufacturers of America, a trade group in Washington, said: "The recession has had a profound impact on purchasing habits. People want value -- a combination of quality and price. When the economy is bad, private-label sales spurt up a bit."
According to a survey by the Gallup Organization for the Private Label Manufacturers Association, even though private-label cereals still have only a fraction of the market, acceptance of them is at an all-time high: "Nearly 9 out of every 10 respondents in the Gallup study, or 86 percent, said they have purchased store brands, a level of acceptance that is unparalleled in U.S. consumer history."
More than 70 percent of the 1,215 shoppers surveyed by telephone said a very important consideration was the "quality of store brands." The survey, which was conducted in September and October 1991, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.
There are several private-label cereal manufacturers. One of the biggest is Ralston Purina, which also has a small share of the national-brand market.
The private-label cereals not only come close in taste, appearance and nutrition to the national brands they are copying, but in many instances the packaging is quite similar.
"They get as close as they can without stealing," Mr. Nedelman said.
And they give their products names that usually make it possible to figure out what they are imitating in a matter of seconds. Cheerios becomes Tasteeos, Cocoa Puffs becomes Cocoa Crunchies, and Fruit Loops are Fruit Rings. When the name doesn't provide an immediate clue, the picture on the front of the box does.
Some cereals, like corn flakes, raisin bran and shredded wheat, can use the same names because the names are not trademarked.
When comparing the cereals, there was only one significant difference:private-label raisin bran had more raisins than the national brand. Raisins are a significant source of iron, and in the house brand they provided 100 percent of the Recommended Daily Allowance for iron; Kellogg's Raisin Bran had only 45 percent of the R.D.A. for iron.
The other, less important difference was in the appearance of the bite-size shredded wheat: the pieces in the private-label brand were not neat and tidy little biscuits, like those from Nabisco.
But after they are covered with milk, who would know?


GRAPHIC: These 12 private-label cereals were compared with their brand-name couterparts by Marian Burros. Differences in taste were negligible. The private-label cereals were purchased from Giant Foods, a supermarket chain in Maryland, Virginia and Washington. Ten of the private-label cereals were made by the Ralston Purina Company, one of the biggest such producers. The two shredded wheat products were made by Sunshine Biscuit Company. Manufacturers do not identify themselves on private-label packages.

There are still people around who get a kick out of meeting former New York Mayor EDWARD I. KOCH, and GEORGETTE SHIPP, a court stenographer from Bergenfield, N.J., is one of them.
Not only did she get to exchange a few words with Mr. Koch yesterday afternoon, but he also gave her $10,000, something she had never anticipated when she happened to walk by a promotion being conducted by the Milton Bradley Company for its newest game, "Oodles." 
 Ms. Shipp, 28, who was laid off from her job in December, was walking to the unemployment office when she noticed a crowd in Bryant Park.
"I remembered that the day before someone had handed me a flier about the game 'Oodles' being played there," she said. "I thought, 'Let me give it a shot.' I noticed Ed Koch there and he is one of the first famous people I've seen in my life, so it was exciting."
She answered three questions from the game so her name went into a bowl for the $10,000 drawing. Mr. Koch picked hers out.
Now Ms. Shipp, who graduated from the Stenotype Academy in New York last month, will be able to buy a computerized court-reporting machine and pay off her student loans.
"You just never know what's going to happen," she said. All that good luck, and Mayor Koch, too.

HEADLINE: Justice for Jurors

 BODY:
There should be cheers for Judith Kaye from jury boxes near and far. As New York State's Chief Judge, she has created a special panel to improve the quality of jury life. It's not just a local problem.
Judge Kaye will rate a gold star if her panelists can dispel the frustration of being yanked away from home or job to sit on uncomfortable chairs in an airless room for days on end, waiting to get on a jury. She already qualifies for a silver star for her considerate initiative. 
 The project has three aims: to increase participation by people who are not now summoned, particularly minorities, and by people who duck their duty by claiming exemption; to make the system more efficient, and to make jury duty "a positive experience."
It is already positive for most people who actually make it onto a jury, where they experience a trial and then reach a verdict. But for the many who wait in vain for some involvement the experience is negative. One remedy would be to shorten the number of days on duty; let people go home if they don't get on a jury in the first day or two. Or put them on standby, reachable by telephone.
The panel is headed by Colleen McMahon, a partner at a large New York City firm. The 30 panelists include court officials, lawyers and the like. But several were picked simply because they are real people who have served as jurors.
Some things that need fixing cannot be changed without new law -- raising fees for jury duty, or drawing names from new lists like the unemployment and welfare rolls. But some of Judge Kaye's ideas could be carried out without much ado, if only someone would order them done -- like more telephones in the waiting room, things to read, space to get some work done, cleaner rest rooms, child care services, and more.
Ms. McMahon observed the other day that many jurors feel "everything is done for the lawyer's convenience or the judge's convenience, and nothing for the jurors' convenience." Amen. Judge Kaye's concern may make life better for jurors everywhere, if other states follow her lead. But it's enough if she only makes life better for willing-but-thwarted New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: In America;
Fudging Health Care Costs

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
In the mid-1960's Lyndon Johnson tried to hide the true costs of the Vietnam War from Congress and the American people. He was pushing his Great Society programs and felt that if Congress knew how expensive the war was becoming it would say, in effect, "Mr. President, you can't have both."
And the President knew that instead of financing the Great Society, Congress would choose to finance the war. 
 So Lyndon Johnson concealed the real numbers, declined to seek a tax increase to pay for the war, and set the nation on a moral and fiscal course from which we have yet to recover.
When Richard Nixon ran for President in 1968 he proved to be no more careful with the truth than Lyndon Johnson. Mr. Nixon claimed to have a secret plan to end the war. He didn't. The plan was a fantasy, a figment of a cynical candidate's imagination that was dressed up as fact and sent out to seduce the electorate.
The war went on until 1975.
In 1980 Ronald Reagan told us the biggest whopper of them all. The wonder is that anybody believed him. In his warm and agreeable way, he told us that he would increase military spending, reduce taxes and at the same time, miraculously, he would demolish the deficit and balance the budget.
Mr. Reagan was wildly popular. It was as if Santa Claus had been elected President.
Now Bill Clinton, a fast talker who has already made his share of promises he's been unable to keep, is making his pitch to Congress and the public on health care reform.
The smart money suggests that truth is about to take another shellacking.
With Ronald Reagan's communications director at his elbow, President Clinton claims his plan will bring health care costs under control; will cover every legal resident of the U.S. (including 37 million people who currently have no insurance); will not require a major tax increase, and, incredibly, will generate an extra $91 billion to reduce the budget deficit.
The President insists this will all be accomplished without reducing the quality of medical care.
Enter Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who will try to guide aspects of Mr. Clinton's plan through the Senate Finance Committee. On the NBC News program "Meet the Press," Senator Moynihan said the Administration's claim that it would reap $91 billion in deficit reduction from health care reform was a "fantasy."
And he said the Administration would not get the $238 billion in savings from Medicare and Medicaid that it is planning on. "That's not going to happen," said the Senator.
He suggested that candor would be the Administration's best approach, asserting, "We must not pretend that this is going to be free."
Presidents apparently assume that Americans are incapable of digesting bitter truths. The truth about health care is that major reform cannot be achieved easily or cheaply. There will be pain and sacrifice or there won't be health care reform.
The President has an obligation to be clear about that. There are many benefits to be realized from Mr. Clinton's plan. But it is a proposal that could affect up to one-seventh of the nation's economy. Anything that large has to have some down sides.
Under the plan a significant number of jobs will likely be lost. Many people with good health insurance will pay more and get less coverage. Some health care is likely to be rationed. And it is possible that health care reform could end up adding to the budget deficit.
The President and Hillary Rodham Clinton are now focused on the huge task of selling the health care proposal. The President will give his television address tonight. Tomorrow the Cabinet and other top officials will carry the sales campaign to all 50 states.
Usually in such a campaign the product's benefits are emphasized and its drawbacks or defects are given short shrift. It's the way you sell soap, and cars, and iced tea. It's also the way Lyndon Johnson tried to sell his war and Ronald Reagan sold his economic plan.
It's not the way you want to sell health care reform. The nation deserves a serious and candid discussion of this enormous proposal. And it deserves to hear the truth from its President.

HEADLINE: SUNY Maintains Quality and Access Despite Budget Woes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I read with interest, and sadness, your recent news article about the devastating cuts to public higher education in California and the impact these cuts seem to be having on the access and opportunity that were once hallmarks of California's great public university systems. 
 Because New York State and the State University of New York have also experienced major budget problems -- but at a much more measured pace, with more political support and without the losses of students to other states or to the streets -- I urge potential students of SUNY (and CUNY) not to lose faith or hope.
The State University of New York has indeed suffered through the most difficult budget years in our history, with reductions of some $200 million over a four-year period. Yet even during the darkest fiscal days of 1991-92, both Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the legislative leaders were supportive and constructive in their attitude toward the State University. Budget reductions were reluctantly imposed and efforts were made, as far as possible, to protect SUNY and CUNY.
In recent years both the Governor and the legislative leaders gave SUNY the tools to allow us to manage our way through these fiscal difficulties, first with the 1985 flexibility legislation, then with the 1992 retirement incentives, and this year with additional flexibility measures.
This year, even though the fiscal situation was still tight, the Governor and Legislature approved a budget that gave SUNY the first increase in three years, which seems to have put us on the road to recovery.
Despite our very real problems, SUNY has remained accessible. Enrollments have held constant. New first-time, full-time and transfer enrollments this year will be about the same as last year, and there does not seem to be any exodus of New York students going out of state. This has occurred at a time of significant budget difficulties, and when high school graduating classes in New York State shrank by a stunning 13 percent in only two years.
We are grateful for the support of Governor Cuomo, Senator Ralph J. Marino, Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, the chairmen of the Higher Education Committees, Senator Kenneth LaValle and Assemblyman Edward Sullivan, and legislative colleagues. Their support and the austerity spirit of our faculty and campus presidents will help us to continue weathering a slow economic recovery, but keeping SUNY quality and accessibility high.

HEADLINE: Tell Teen-Agers It's Not O.K. to Get Pregnant;
Lack of Disincentives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Lynn Martin decries the "past where a child was branded illegitimate or a desperate marriage ruined two or more lives," and she decries it as "equally damaging to ignore the economic and social realities faced today by single teen-age mothers" (Op-Ed, Sept. 8). 
 Unfortunately, these economic and social realities look a lot worse to us than they do to her. Obviously, if they looked as bad to her, she would act differently, as indeed she did in the past. Society fails strongly to disapprove of unwed motherhood and to make such a state abhorrent to the single teen-age mother and to her parent(s). The result is what you see today. That is why society imposed such strictures in the first place!
It is not the incentive of welfare but rather the lack of disincentives -- both societal and economic -- that has led to the current situation. The knowledge that she and her baby won't starve, indeed that they will not even have to inconvenience the existing household -- or even the father by requiring support and extra room -- removes any impediment to the girl, to her parents and to the baby's father. In short, why not?
In the old days the girl's father went after his daughter's lover with a shotgun. Why? Partly because of the shame, and partly because he didn't want the financial responsibility of raising some teen-age boy's children. Today, we all have to raise teen-age boys' children. And the shame is on us, not on them.
The solution is simple. Make birth control available, finance free or inexpensive abortions, at least the first time, and remove all financial assistance. Nature will quickly take its course. The result will be the greatest kindness to the greatest number: a few bad marriages and illegitimate children, but far, far more children born into mature, two-parent families.

HEADLINE: U.S. Vision of Foreign Policy Reversed

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
President Clinton's national security adviser today presented the first outline of the Administration's foreign policy vision. The adviser, Anthony Lake, said the vision aimed to replace the cold-war policy to contain the Soviet threat with a policy to enlarge the family of democratic market economies.
"The successor to a doctrine of containment must be a strategy of enlargement, enlargement of the world's free community of market democracies," Mr. Lake said in a speech at the School of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University. 
 At the time it is announcing its health-care initiative, the Administration has also started a blitz of speeches to define the guiding principles of its foreign policy, after having been criticized by many foreign-policy experts for lacking a coherent framework for making decisions on issues like Bosnia and China.
The public, though, seems to be warming to Mr. Clinton's foreign policy. A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted from Sept. 16 to Sept. 18 showed that 52 percent of Americans approved of Mr. Clinton's handling of foreign affairs and 25 percent disapproved, with 23 percent expressing no opinion. A month earlier 42 percent approved, 42 disapproved and 16 expressed no opinion.
 
Response to Critics
 The shift may stem in part from the remarkable handshake at the White House last week between Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel. Mr. Clinton presided over the ceremony.
On Monday, Secretary of State Warren Christopher outlined Administration plans to finance the Middle East peace efforts. On Thursday the representative at the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, is to give an address on the use of force and foreign policy, replying to critics who say the Administration has excessively emphasized multilateralism.
Next Monday, President Clinton is to address the United Nations on America's role in international peacekeeping.
The essence of Mr. Lake's speech today in Baltimore was the issue of choice, that in a world in which the United States no longer has to worry daily about a Soviet nuclear threat where and how it intervenes abroad is increasingly a matter of choice. What he tried to do in his hourlong speech was to lay out the broad principles on which the Administration would make its choices.
"To be successful a strategy of enlargement must provide distinctions and set priorities," said Mr. Lake, who cited four areas that should guide foreign policy, but refrained from discussing specifics for places like Bosnia or Somalia.
The highest priority in a strategy of enlargement, he told the students and professors, "must be to strengthen the core of major market democracies, the bonds among them and their sense of common interest." Economic stagnation and its political consequences, Mr. Lake said, "undermine the ability of the major democratic powers to act decisively on our many common challenges, from GATT to Bosnia."
 
'Make the Greatest Difference'
 The second imperative for enlargement is to help democracy and markets expand and survive in places like Russia, Eastern Europe and other former Communist lands "where we have the strongest security concerns and where we can make the greatest difference," said Mr. Lake, who spoke before news of the latest upheaval in Russia.
The goal has to be to transform formerly threatening countries into economic and diplomatic partners. Practically speaking, that means continuing to drum up international economic support for the still fragile Russian efforts and taking tough public positions to staunch the reversal of democracy in places like Haiti, Guatemala and Nigeria, he said.
The third element, he said, are the choices that have to be made to minimize "the ability of states outside the circle of democracy and markets to threaten it." Policy toward rogue states like Iraq or North Korea, Mr. Lake said, has "seek to isolate them diplomatically, militarily, economically and technologically."
The fourth part, he added, has to be deciding where to intervene in human rights tragedies in an era in which restraints on intervention abroad are far fewer than in the days of the superpower confrontation.
"Public pressure for our humanitarian engagement increasingly may be driven by televised images, which can depend in turn on such considerations as where CNN sends its camera crews," Mr. Lake said. "But we must bring other considerations to bear as well, cost, feasibility, the permanence of the improvement our assistance will bring, the willingness of regional and international bodies to do their part and the likelihood that our actions will generate broader security benefits for the people and the region in question."
Mr. Lake said efforts in Somalia and Bosnia were "important expressions of our overall engagement, but they do not by themselves define our broader strategy in the world."
He said although there were "clear reasons to engage and persist" in Bosnia, "they do not obliterate other American interests involving Europe and Russia, and they do not justify the extreme costs of taking unilateral responsibility for imposing a solution."

HEADLINE: Restaurant Empires Built of Diverse Pieces

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
SEEKING financial stability in rough economic times, chefs and restaurateurs are both diversifying and opening less-expensive places. Rather than staking their futures on a single crown jewel, they are trying to feed people in as many ways and places as they can dream up. They are opening bistros, spaghetti houses, pizza parlors, carryout shops and bakeries. They're providing off-premises catering. And they're selling jams, salsas and T-shirts -- even copies of the restaurant's furniture.
The restaurant mania of the 1980's encouraged the most fashionable chefs to open more than one expensive place, sometimes in different cities. Most of them soon learned that those restaurants could not be sustained without their presence. When the economy worsened and the great shakeout began, their enterprises suffered. Some were left with only their original restaurant; others were left with nothing. Stephan Pyles, who began with the highly acclaimed Routh Street Cafe and Baby Routh in Dallas and went on to open two more restaurants in Minneapolis, has no restaurant now, though he is working on a new place that is expected to open this year in Dallas. 
 The 1990's present a new challenge. Today, said Wolfgang Puck, the Los Angeles chef who is one of the most successful empire builders, security, rather than ego or novelty, is the driving force.
"A single restaurant depends on a particular chef," Mr. Puck said. "It is an added security to have smaller restaurants, cafes, frozen packaged food. Very few people can afford $50 to $60 for dinner."
Many chefs are able to expand into related food businesses because they tend to be better educated and more financially astute than they were two decades ago and because they are in great demand as partners. Like the seamstress in a little atelier whose ability with a needle turned her talent into a clothing empire, these chefs have parlayed their signature restaurants into culinary empires.
"The opportunities are so much greater today for chefs," Mr. Puck said. "People come to them to open new places." Mr. Puck began earlier than most to parlay the success of Spago, which opened in 1982 in Los Angeles, into Chinois on Main in Santa Monica, Calif.; Spago in Tokyo; Postrio in San Francisco; Granita in Malibu, Calif., and most recently Wolfgang Puck's California Cafe in Universal City, a semi-fast-food restaurant that specializes in pizza and grilled chicken.
But even Mr. Puck has made some costly mistakes. His brewery-restaurant, Eureka, folded in 1992 and lost $5 million. "I made a mistake making the brewery and the restaurant one company," he said. "The restaurant was very successful, but the brewery drained all the money. We were undercapitalized. It was a good lesson not to be involved in something over which I have no control."
An effort to market frozen desserts in 1986 also flopped. "We probably overestimated what we could do. The desserts were too expensive -- $2 to $2.25 a portion," he said. "It was very badly planned." Mr. Puck has been very successful with his frozen-pizza business, which started in the late 80's and has been in the black for three years.
Mark Miller of Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., and Red Sage in Washington has also been experimenting with diversification. Both restaurants have retail stores selling food, T-shirts, cookbooks and trinkets. The Santa Fe store, Coyote Casino, is quite successful, earning $750,000 a year in its 800 square feet, Mr. Miller said. "The only way to have a top-quality restaurant is to have a diversified income," Mr. Miller said. "We lower our costs in the restaurant when we buy in large amounts."
The combination store-restaurant concept also provides a certain synergy. "When you buy a Ralph Lauren T-shirt, you are buying into a certain life style," he said. "When you are eating in a certain restaurant, you are buying into a certain style represented by the restaurant. A store makes the style of the restaurant more accessible."
Even the design elements of Red Sage are for sale, if somebody asks. Someone bought a dozen solid cherry, leather upholstered chairs at $600 each. But T-shirts with the Red Sage logo remain the best sellers. "We sell a T-shirt that costs $7 for $15," Mr. Miller said. "We make the same $8 as we make off $100 worth of food, and it's advertising and it doesn't go bad."
The Red Sage General Store has not proven to be as successful as the Coyote Casino. Donald Senich, the general manager of all the Red Sage enterprises, said the reason may be because the clientele in the Washington restaurant is made up largely of business people, while in Santa Fe the customers tend to be tourists who have time to browse in the store next door.
Mr. Miller is looking for other ways to make and save money. Red Sage is starting to buy produce and fish directly from the wholesale market, cutting out the middlemen, a move that is expected to save 30 percent. It has also contracted with farmers in nearby Virginia to grow fruits and vegetables for the restaurant next year.
Meanwhile, another Coyote Cafe is scheduled to open in Las Vegas, Nev., in mid-December, and Mr. Miller is planning a series of Asian restaurants that could be replicated easily.
Unlike other chefs who always want to be connected to a stove, Mr. Miller, who is an anthropologist by training, seems bitten by the entrepreneurial bug. "It's very hard, once you start running companies, to cook someone's chicken on the grill," he said.
Michel Richard of Citrus in Los Angeles, who started his professional life as a pastry chef, has a different perspective. No matter how far-flung his empire, he never wants to be away from his pots and pans. "Being a chef is a religion," he said. But having an empire is good for the ego and for security.
"I like to see my name all over the place. I have a big ego. I also have six kids, and it's tough to make money in one place."
Citrus has bred a smorgasbord of business ventures: three less-expensive versions of itself -- Citronelle, in Santa Barbara, Calif., Washington and Baltimore; a sorbet shop in Washington; the Broadway Deli in Santa Monica; a business that sells jams, olive oil and souvenirs at Los Angeles International Airport, which are also sold at the Broadway Deli; a videocassette on cooking, and a cookbook to be published in November. Mr. Richard is also talking with Villeroy & Boch about putting out a line of china.
Some restaurateurs are building similar empires. The Santo family, owners of the Sign of the Dove, have four other, lower-priced restaurants in Manhattan -- Arizona 206, its cafe, Contrapunto and Yellowfingers, each with a different theme -- as well as Ecce Panis, a bakery with two locations. Ecce Panis supplies bread to all the restaurants and to the public.
The original bakery and the restaurants are within a five-block area on the Upper East Side. "That makes it manageable," said Henny Santo, one of the owners. "If we have a problem, it allows us to be at all five restaurants within the hour.
"Opening two Sign of the Doves is not economically feasible today," she said. "Different types of restaurants are more interesting to create and allow for diversity. Depending on economic times, one restaurant may not be doing well, and with other kinds of restaurants you have a cushion." Mrs. Santo said that after the stock-market crash in 1987, which signaled the beginning of a recession in New York, the restaurants with less-expensive meals "were supporting the Dove," where the prices are higher.
Even Kin Khao, a two-year-old Thai restaurant in SoHo, has diversified, opening an Asian grocery and noodle shop. Brad Kelley, who owns the restaurant and store with Lee Ping, said they hoped to open noodle shops elsewhere in the city, something they would not do with Kin Khao because "it would lose its uniqueness."
Mark Peel and Nancy Silverton always knew that one restaurant would not provide an economic cushion. "The restaurant is not your retirement," Mr. Peel said. "There is never that sense of permanence because the life cycle of a restaurant is limited."
By opening both a restaurant, Campanile, and La Brea Bakery in Los Angeles, they played to their strengths. Ms. Silverton, who was a well-known baker, turned out breads and pastries for the restaurant, the public and other restaurants. Within two years, La Brea reached its production limit. Last year, it moved to much larger quarters.
"The restaurant business has been tough in the last few years," Mr. Peel said, "but the bakery business has been terrific. Bread is not subject to trends as much as restaurants are."
Unlike other chef-entrepreneurs, Roberto Donna, of Galileo in Washington, isn't looking to the future, at least not yet, but he is busily building his own empire.
He insisted he was not expanding for monetary rewards, even though he is an owner of I Matti, a trattoria; Pesce, a fish market and restaurant; Il Radicchio, a pizzeria and spaghetti house; Il Pane, a bakery, and El Patio, a South American restaurant, and has opened a catering division of Galileo.
"If I want to make big money I need to open a big place," he said. "You always hope to make some money, and probably psychologically I'm preparing for when business is going down, but now Galileo gets more and more business. In each restaurant we serve different food, and it's fun to cook different food all day. I'm never bored."
Besides, Mr. Donna said, he's too young to worry about the future: "I'm not looking for security; I'm only 32."

HEADLINE: Aristide Seeks the Removal Of Army and Police Chiefs

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 21

 BODY:
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide called today for the immediate removal of the head of the Haitian military, the Port-au-Prince police chief and hundreds of plainclothes police officers who the deposed President said have been involved in politically motivated killings in recent weeks.
"Cedras is a killer, Michel Francois is a killer and, of course, we ask for their removal," Father Aristide, a Roman Catholic priest, said at a news conference. Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras is the head of Haitian armed forces, who deposed him in a coup two years ago, and Colonel Francois is in charge of the police in the country's capital. 
 But despite a recent surge in violence, which included the assassination of a close adviser, Father Aristide stopped short of calling for the immediate reimposition of economic sanctions against Haiti.
The sanctions were suspended by the United Nations Security Council on Aug. 27 as part of an agreement between Father Aristide, Haiti's first democratically elected President, and Mr. Cedras that is supposed to lead to President Aristide's return to power on Oct. 30.
"If in the light of those agreements, the international community thinks the imposition of sanctions is the best way to reach the goal, which is the removal, the immediate removal, of the coup leaders, I say yes," Father Aristide said.
 
Governors Island Accords
 Later, Father Aristide said he personally supported reimposing sanctions on the ground that Haiti's military leaders, by engaging in politically motivated killings, had violated the agreement, which was signed on Governors Island in New York.
"I respect the Governors Island accords, and therefore I am in favor of resuming sanctions," he said.
But the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said today that he would not recommend that the Security Council reimpose sanctions now. He told Reuters, the news agency, that he preferred to await the arrival of United Nations police monitors, mainly from France and Canada, in the next two weeks.
"Before asking for new sanctions, let us begin the process, and then we will see," Mr. Boutros-Ghali said.
Clinton Administration officials say they are not inclined to support reimposing sanctions now. Rather, they prefer to continue plans to purge Haiti's military and police of leaders who have been involved in human rights abuses and to give training to lower-ranking soldiers and police officers.
 
U.N. Aides Blame Police Chief
 Father Aristide held his news conference at TransAfrica, a black-run public policy group that specializes in issues dealing with Africa and the Caribbean.
United Nations officials, including Dante Caputo, the special United Nations envoy for Haiti, blame the police chief, Colonel Francois, and plain-clothes officers known as "attaches" for much of the violence in Haiti.
Father Aristide said the police force must be purged of these officers, whom he compared to the notorious Tontons Macoutes, the secret police force that operated under the former dictator Francois Duvalier.
"The heads have to be removed and with them the attaches who are the Macoutes," President Aristide said.
 
Safety Concerns Raised
 Some civil rights leaders expressed concern to President Aristide about his personal safety. Some, like Wade Henderson, director of the Washington office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, drew the analogy with Benigno Aquino, the former Philippines Senator who was assassinated the day he returned home from a self-imposed exile in 1983.
Mr. Henderson suggested in the meeting that Father Aristide delay his return until his safety could be asssured. But Father Aristide refused, saying his restoration would be "a day of international celebration."

 Later, Father Aristide said he personally supported reimposing sanctions on the ground that Haiti's military leaders, by engaging in politically motivated killings, had violated the agreement, which was signed on Governors Island in New York.
"I respect the Governors Island accords, and therefore I am in favor of resuming sanctions," he said.
But the United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, said today that he would not recommend that the Security Council reimpose sanctions now. He told Reuters, the news agency, that he preferred to await the arrival of United Nations police monitors, mainly from France and Canada, in the next two weeks.
"Before asking for new sanctions, let us begin the process, and then we will see," Mr. Boutros-Ghali said.
Clinton Administration officials say they are not inclined to support reimposing sanctions now. Rather, they prefer to continue plans to purge Haiti's military and police of leaders who have been involved in human rights abuses and to give training to lower-ranking soldiers and police officers.
 
U.N. Aides Blame Police Chief
 Father Aristide held his news conference at TransAfrica, a black-run public policy group that specializes in issues dealing with Africa and the Caribbean.
United Nations officials, including Dante Caputo, the special United Nations envoy for Haiti, blame the police chief, Colonel Francois, and plain-clothes officers known as "attaches" for much of the violence in Haiti.
Father Aristide said the police force must be purged of these officers, whom he compared to the notorious Tontons Macoutes, the secret police force that operated under the former dictator Francois Duvalier.
"The heads have to be removed and with them the attaches who are the Macoutes," President Aristide said.
 
Safety Concerns Raised
 Some civil rights leaders expressed concern to President Aristide about his personal safety. Some, like Wade Henderson, director of the Washington office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, drew the analogy with Benigno Aquino, the former Philippines Senator who was assassinated the day he returned home from a self-imposed exile in 1983.
Mr. Henderson suggested in the meeting that Father Aristide delay his return until his safety could be asssured. But Father Aristide refused, saying his restoration would be "a day of international celebration."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: The Overview;
CLINTON ASKS BACKING FOR SWEEPING CHANGE IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
President Clinton sought to establish a place in history tonight as the guarantor of health care for all Americans, asking Congress and a national television audience to work with him to enact the most sweeping national program since Social Security in 1935.
He argued that this was the time to confront and vanquish a problem that had thwarted past Presidents back to Franklin D. Roosevelt. 
 "Tonight we come together to write a new chapter in the American story," he told the joint session of Congress. "This health care system is badly broken and it is time to fix it." [Transcript, page A24.]
 
'Most Urgent Priority'
 He said, "At long last, after decades of false starts, we must make this our most urgent priority: giving every American health security, health care that can never be taken away, health care that is always there."
The President paid tribute to his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the plan's architect, who watched the speech in a packed House chamber, saying: "When I launched our nation on the journey to reform the health care system, I knew we needed a talented navigator." He continued: "Luckily for me and our nation, I didn't have to search very far." At that, the lawmakers sprang to their feet for one of two standing ovations they gave the First Lady. Mrs. Clinton beamed back from the gallery, where she sat between C. Everett Koop, Surgeon General in the Reagan Administration, and T. Berry Brazelton, the noted pediatrician.
 
Angry Descriptions
 The speech signified the culmination of eight months of planning and political bargaining. And long before Mr. Clinton walked into the House chamber tonight, the speech had been firmly established in Washington as defining for his Presidency. Alternating long descriptions of policy with forceful, even angry descriptions of conditions today, he clearly held that same political sense of the moment himself.
As he described a plan that would be gradually phased in by the year 2000, his choice of words often recalled the themes that had worked in his campaign for the White House. He spoke often of "change" and the "courage to change." And his litany of responsibilities that Americans should accept -- reducing teen-age violence and pregnancy, quitting excessive smoking and drinking -- recalled the neo-liberal values that helped him appeal to former Reagan and Bush voters.
The need to act was warmly acknowledged by the lawmakers of both parties, who repeatedly applauded Mr. Clinton's exhortations and appeals for change. But the blizzard of comments, pro and con, that swept in from interest groups that felt he was going too far, or not far enough, foreshadowed the hazards to come.
 
Two Early Problems
 While the President promised security, in order to attain it his plan would not only alter the shape of one seventh of the economy but would change one of the most sensitive relationships in American society: the ties between doctors and patients.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged the issue's programmatic and political complexity. But he said the nation was in "a time of great change when miracles do happen." A handshake has shattered the deadlock in the Middle East and the Berlin Wall has fallen, he noted, adding: "Now it is our turn to strike a blow for freedom -- the freedom for Americans to live without fear of their own nation's health care system."
At the immediate legislative level, two sets of headaches were instantly clear today. House committee chairmen argued about who would get to have Mrs. Clinton testify first, and Republicans emerged from a White House meeting this morning with instantly conflicting views.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the minority leader, said after the morning meeting, "We can have bipartisanship." But Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the No. 3 House Republican leader, scorned the President's plan as "unacceptable" because of its large Government role and attacked today's efforts as "the biggest marketing operation since New Coke."
The Democrats who commented were generally hopeful. Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, who broke with Mr. Clinton over free trade on Tuesday, said this morning: "I said in the meeting that everybody in the room has worked on this issue for their whole time in Congress, and we don't have much to show for it. I'm more optimistic now about getting health care done than I've ever been since I've been here."
 
Promise to All
 The plan, which Mr. Clinton sketched tonight only in broad outline but will formally submit as legislation in a few weeks, seeks universal health insurance coverage for all Americans, including the 37 million now not insured. They would be guaranteed a generous basic package of coverage, negotiated separately in each state by alliances of consumers with insurance companies and medical groups. Most employers would be required to pay 80 percent of average premiums.
Every American and legal alien resident would have a personal health care card, which Mr. Clinton brandished tonight. It would serve as a promise that insurance would never be canceled, even for people who fall ill or lose their jobs. Mr. Clinton says only about $100 billion in additional taxes would be needed, including a hefty increase in cigarette taxes.
The program promises a new prescription-drug benefit for the elderly, and, by limiting annual increases in insurance premiums, seeks to hold down costs in the private sector. That would make it possible to cut $234 billion over the expected increases in Medicare and Medicaid costs over the next seven years without simply pushing those costs onto other customers. Those savings estimates are probably the most doubted part of his plan; few lawmakers consider it politically possible to achieve those savings.
Mrs. Clinton carried the burdens both of organizing the development of the plan and explaining it to Congress, where lawmakers have been impressed with her thoroughness and ability to listen even when they disagreed with her solutions.
As he described his plan, the President emphasized six "fixed stars," or critical principles that health care legislation must follow, while stressing that he is ready to work with Congress and change specific provisions of his proposal.
He listed "the principles that must guide our reform of America's health care system: security, simplicity and savings; choice, quality and responsibility."
Security is plainly the Administration's first selling point, and the President began by saying: "Security means that those who do not have health care coverage will have it and, for those who have it, it will never be taken away. We must achieve that security as soon as possible."
He described the health security card that will guarantee benefits "that can never be taken away." And he said "So let us agree on this: whatever else we disagree on, before this Congress finishes its work next year, you will pass, and I will sign, legislation to guarantee this security to every citizen of this country."
Mr. Clinton, addressing one fear that could cripple the plan politically, promised to "maintain the Medicare system."
Simplicity would be achieved, he said, by reducing paperwork. "We have more than 1,500 insurers with hundreds and hundreds of different forms," he said. Those forms, he continued, are "exasperating for anyone who's ever tried to sit down around a table and wade through them and figure them out," and because of it, "the medical care industry is drowning in paperwork."
 
Route to Savings
 Savings were essential, he said, because "rampant medical inflation is eating away at our wages, our savings, our investment capital, our ability to create new jobs in the private sector and this public treasury."
He said savings would be achieved when limits on insurance premiums and curbs on the growth of Medicare and Medicaid force changes in the system.
Universal coverage was essential to savings, because "when people don't have any health insurance, they still get health care, but they get it when it's too late, when it's too expensive -- often from the most expensive place of all, the emergency room."
He said choice would be greater, not less, under his plan. "Americans believe they ought to be able to choose their own health care plan and keep their own doctors. And I think all of us agree. Under any plan we pass, they ought to have that right."
Greater responsibility, he said, was needed to make the system work better. At one level, he said, that would mean insurance companies could no longer cancel customers when they got sick, and profiteering and fraud must be punished.
But more broadly, he said: "Responsibility in our health care system isn't about them. It's about you. It's about me. It's about each of us."
He said every American should pay something toward their health care, even if it was "as small as a $10 co-payment."
He said, "Every employer should provide coverage, just as three-quarters do now. Those who pay are picking up the tab for those who don't today. I don't think that's right."
While there would be some changes in costs, with increases for firms that now provide no coverage or for young single people in their 20's he said, "the vast majority of the Americans watching this tonight will pay the same or less for health care coverage that will be the same or better than the coverage they have tonight."
After going through those points, Mr. Clinton warned that the nation would soon be "bombarded with information from all kinds of sources." He said, "I ask you only to think of this: when you hear all of these arguments ask yourself whether the cost of staying on this same course isn't greater than the cost of change, and ask yourself when you hear the arguments whether the arguments are in your interest or someone else's."
The President was interrupted by applause 35 times in a 53-minute speech.
In the Republican Party's formal televised response, the tones were deliberately muted, and the party's highest-visibility speakers, like Mr. Dole and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House minority whip, were kept to the sidelines.
In a conscious effort to portray his party as open to cooperation and compromise after the bitter partisanship of fights over the budget and economic stimulus measures, Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina began and closed by emphasizing hopes for agreement.
"We all agree that we need to increase access to health care," he began a speech prepared for delivery after Mr. Clinton's. And he concluded by saying, "Republicans will work with the Administration to forge a health care system that will work for you. We give you that commitment,"
But in between he scoffed at the Administration's draft proposals as "a giant social experiment devised by theorists who have never met a payroll." He said Mr. Clinton's " 'one size fits all' Federal health care system will be bitter medicine for Americans to swallow."
Mr. Campbell was joined by Senator Connie Mack of Florida, who said the national debate to come would be over how -- not whether -- to accomplish health reform. "And we want it done right," Senator Mack said, "with less government and more freedom."
Representative Nancy Johnson of Connecticut said Republicans "oppose what amounts to national price-fixing."
"We need not sacrifice jobs or compromise economic opportunity to assure all citizens access to good health care," she said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN: News Analysis;
Pledging Peace of Mind

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
President Clinton rode to power on the economic anxiety of the middle class and the promise that the Government could do something about it. Tonight, standing before the nation with a health security card in his hand, he tried to deliver, pledging a vast new benefit for all Americans.
"With this card, if you lose your job or you switch jobs, you're covered," Mr. Clinton declared, holding aloft the freshly-minted red, white and blue card. "If you leave your job to start a small business, you're covered. If you're an early retiree, you're covered." 
 In his speech and in the political struggle to come, Mr. Clinton hopes to move beyond the contentious details of the health plan and keep the public focused on the fundamentals: the fear of a medical catastrophe, the security of "health care that's always there," and the promise of a card as tangible and comforting as the Social Security card was to the Depression generation.
The idea of health care reform has gained force on the campaign trail over the last five years, breaking through in the 1991 Pennsylvania Senate race and driving much of the 1992 Presidential campaign before bringing Mr. Clinton to this speech. "It is a magic moment and we must seize it," the President said, in a speech infused with an almost wartime sense of urgency.
But now comes the hard part.
What his advisers hope the public carries away from tonight's speech is the image of lawmakers, Republican and Democratic alike, applauding the broad goals set forth by the President, beginning a period of bipartisan work on health care. They hope the lawmakers respond to Mr. Clinton's gestures of conciliation, to his plea to make health care a crusade that transcends partisan politics, to his willingness to bend on details in pursuit of the first truly national health insurance program.
"This is our chance," Mr. Clinton declared. "This is our journey. And, when our work is done, we will know that we have answered the call of history and met the challenge of our times."
What the White House fears is a debate that bogs down in mechanics, that turns partisan and parochial, that pushes all the interest groups that have a stake in what amounts to a seventh of the American economy into blocking one part or another of a sweeping bill, ending in a stalemate.
Senator Jay Rockefeller, the West Virginia Democrat who has worked on the health issue for years and is a Clinton ally, said today: "The problem with legislation is that people always focus on this part or that part that they don't like. And they forget that we're not trying to invent some new program; we're trying to save ourselves from catastrophe."
This, in fact, will be a central theme from both the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who led the task force on health care and will continue to lobby for the bill. Mr. Clinton illustrated his speech, again and again, with horror stories of people trapped and brutalized in the current system. The choice, he and Mrs. Clinton will argue, is changing the system or remaining with a disastrous status quo. And the debate, they will argue, should not lose sight of the broadest goals that are shared by millions of Americans.
With some frustration, Mrs. Clinton said this week: "When Franklin Roosevelt proposed Social Security, he didn't go out selling it with actuarial tables and books of regulations. He basically said, 'Look, here's the deal: You pay in; you're taken care of; you have Social Security in your old age.' If he'd had to have been pressed to the wall saying, 'Well, what about the spouse who didn't work, and what about somebody who only worked 20 quarters instead of 24 quarters' -- I mean we would never have had Social Security."
 
No Easy Task
 Nobody, in fact, ever suggested that modern politics made sweeping social programs easy. Mr. Clinton is trying to do what Presidents Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon could not, and he is trying to do it when the public is in a quirky and dangerous mood. The public, in fact, does see problems on the domestic front, led by the economy and health care. But the skepticism toward government, epitomized by the following Ross Perot has attracted, is great.
This tension between a yearning for action and a doubt that government can truly deliver has become a hallmark of the Clinton Presidency, and it will be at the center of the struggle over health care. Mr. Clinton all but glows with his confidence in government to pull off this extraordinary feat; his aides, notably Ira C. Magaziner, have been briefing eagerly and happily on the workings of their plan. The emotional subtext for all these briefings by all these Clintonians is powerful: a generation of Democrats shut out of power by the 1980's is scaling the Mount Everest of social policy.
They see a nation of consumers, newly informed and empowered, making rational health care choices based on a wealth of data from their health care alliance. It is, in their view, and in the view articulated by the President himself tonight, the Clintonian third way -- neither left nor right, neither government-run nor left to the vagaries of an ill-functioning market.
 
Now, the Debate
 But on Capitol Hill, and all over the country, a rough debate is about to begin. The first phase is already clear: can the Administration achieve the savings it projects in Medicare and Medicaid spending to finance much of its package? Other flash points are apparent: for all the talk of bipartisan cooperation, can Republicans and Democrats agree on requiring all employers to pay part of their employee's premium costs?
Is the Clinton blend of market forces and regulatory controls a uniquely American system, as its architects argue, or a hodgepodge, as its critics assert?
And, perhaps the biggest question, can the Government actually fix this problem? This was the question that Mr. Clinton returned to again and again in his speech tonight. "It's hard to believe that once there was a time, in this century, when retirement was nearly synonomous with poverty, and older Americans died in the streets," he said. "That is unthinkable today because over half a century ago Americans had the courage to change, to create a Social Security system that insures no Americans will be forgotten in their later years."
And yet, it requires a leap of faith.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was in Congress when President Johnson finally succeeded in passing the Medicare program. In an interview today, he praised the leadership now being shown on health care but declined to predict an outcome. "This is big," said a man who has seen huge legislation come and go and who has rarely seemed cowed.

HEADLINE: President's Nominee As Head of Military Backs Bosnia Force

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, President Clinton's choice to be the top officer of the armed forces, gave strong support today for sending 25,000 American troops to Bosnia to help enforce any peace settlement reached there, but said the overall operation would cost $4 billion in the first year alone.
General Shalikashvili, a Polish-born artillery officer named to succeed Gen. Colin L. Powell as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee that a force of 50,000 heavily armed NATO troops would have a good chance of success in such a mission, if the proper command structure was established and the warring factions committed themselves to observe an agreement.
 
A 'Tragic Association'
 The general also said he had been shocked to learn that his father fought in World War II in a Nazi-organized unit commanded by the Waffen SS. The general said he learned about his father's ties with the SS unit only last month from news reports. 
 "I'm deeply saddened that my father had this tragic association," General Shalikashvili said in his opening statement. "To me, he was a kind and gentle man, and I loved him very much."
His statement, read earnestly, lasted only about five minutes and the references to his father came at the very end, just before he began taking questions from the Senators.
In his confirmation hearing before the Senate panel today, General Shalikashvili (pronounced shah-lee-kahsh-VEE-lee) countered the skepticism that many Senators voiced about American involvement in the Balkans with a strongly argued rationale.
"The alternative of not doing so is also very expensive," said General Shalikashvili, who is the current NATO military commander. "There is a likelihood that fighting will break out again, that it will reach sort of a final crescendo."
[In Brussels, the Balkan negotiators told NATO officials that any force sent to Bosnia should be well-armed and deployed quickly. Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations envoy, said that the NATO force would probably face opposition from local "warlords" who answer to no one. Lord Owen, the European Community negotiator, said there was a need to "go in fast and firmly with a seriously credible force" and that it must be more powerful than the lightly armed peacekeepers now deployed by the United Nations.]
General Shalikashvili, 57, who directed the relief operation to help the Kurds in northern Iraq after the Persian Gulf war, warned that winter in Sarajevo is less than 60 days away and residents face harsher prospects than they did last winter. "Women and children and old people will pay an awful price if there is not a peace settlement," he said.
General Shalikashvili's comments stand in contrast to the cautious views of General Powell. Both officers have expressed reservations about the usefulness of air strikes to achieve military results in Bosnia and of putting American ground troops in Bosnia before the warring Serbs, Croats and Muslims reach a peace agreement.
But General Shalikashvili, who was General Powell's top aide before taking the NATO post and is his choice to succeed him as Chairman, has also said the West tended to overestimate the military power of the Serbs and has seemed more willing to send American troops to enforce a peace accord.
 
Warm Reception From Panel
 Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the panel, said General Shalikashvili's confirmation was virtually assured, but that a vote by the full Senate might be delayed until the Administration names the general's successor at NATO.
Senior Pentagon officials said today that Mr. Clinton would nominate Gen. George A. Joulwan of the Army, who heads the United States Southern Command in Panama. General Joulwan is responsible for American military activities in Latin America, except for Mexico and the Caribbean. He has also held several commands in Europe.
General Shalikashvili today received a warm reception from the panel. Senators refrained from questioning him about what he knew about his father's military career, and seemed to go out of their way not to blame the son for the father's mistakes.
General Shalikashvili's toughest questioning came from Senators who expressed fears that the United States faced increasing danger of sending troops to ill-defined, open-ended regional conflicts around the world.
General Shalikashvili said that Washington should send troops only to conflicts in which the United States had a clearly defined interest, proper control over American forces, and the ability to withdraw at its discretion.
When Senators asked how Somalia fit that description, the general defended the United Nations mission there. "If we were to leave now, we might put in danger all that was done and the country might very well return to where it was," he said.
But he also criticized the operation. "I am bothered that the United Nations that runs this operation does not have a clear articulation of the political and economic goals," he said. "That's a failure to communicate."

HEADLINE: Secrets of Long Life From 2 Who Ought to Know;
In Their Book, Westchester Sisters Share Lessons From More Than a Century of Living

BYLINE: By MELINDA HENNEBERGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON, N.Y., Sept. 17

 BODY:
Two days shy of her 104th birthday, Sarah De lany and her younger sister, Annie Elizabeth, who is 102, sat in their front parlor doling out secrets to long life like candy on Halloween night. (Yoga, cod liver oil and a daily dose of garlic, chopped fine and swallowed whole, are all recommended.)
Sadie and Bessie Delany, daughters of a slave who became the country's first black bishop of the Episcopal Church, have also lived to tell how they outsmarted the "rebby boys" of the Jim Crow South and outlasted just about everyone who ever tried to hold them back. 
 Bessie Delany became the second black female dentist in New York State, while Sadie Delany became the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school. (In recent years, she received a letter from the Board of Education threatening to cut off her pension unless she proved she was still alive.) They moved to Harlem in its heyday, surviving the Depression and socializing with the likes of Cab Calloway and W. E. B. DuBois.
And now they are relishing the chance to pass on some of what they learned along the way, in a book written with Amy Hill Hearth, "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First Hundred Years" (Kodansha). Released here on Sept. 10 and in Japan on Sept. 15, in time for Revere Your Elders Day, it is already in its third printing.
"A long time ago nothing that black people did was put in books," noted Sadie Delany, a handsome woman in a rose-colored suit, sitting ramrod straight by a window in a room lined with old volumes and family photographs.
The sisters had no plans to tell their story to the world until a news paper article about them attracted the interest of a publisher; they still have trouble believing that so many people are interested in them. These days, there is a waiting list of reporters and television crews eager for an invitation to the red brick home they bought in 1957, when they were among the first blacks to integrate Mount Vernon.
The two sisters, who have lived together all their lives, still do their own cooking and look after the place with the help of a housekeeper who comes every other week.
"She's 87," Bessie Delany said approvingly. "She's our speed."
And they still take good care of each other, as they have always done.
"I've never been afraid or alone in my life," Bessie Delany said.
They were so sheltered growing up on the college campus of Saint Augustine's College in Raleigh, N.C., where their parents taught and raised 10 children, that they were shocked by the franker passages of the Bible.
"We never went downtown in our lives without an escort until we were grown women," said Sadie Delany, instinctively reaching behind her sister's chair to pull her jacket around her when it slipped off one shoulder. But their parents' protectiveness was all to the good, they said. In those days, the sisters said, white men often kept a "colored family" on the side, and their father warned them of the dangers of even speaking to a white man, or any married man.
After the Jim Crow laws went into effect in Raleigh in 1896, when the sisters were children, they remembered the rude surprise of being asked to step to the back of the trolley car and refused service at a drugstore where they had always gone for nickel limeades.
Even then, they said, they managed to find ways around some of the restrictions. Sadie Delany's system was playing dumb, refusing to understand directions to sit in the back of a store, asking "Back where?" until she wore the shopkeepers down. Her sister's method was more daring.
 
Talk of the 'Surrender'
 "Miss Fresh was always looking for ways to do what I pleased," said Bessie Delany, whose wry smile and bright eyes give away an exuberantly subversive nature. Remembering sneaking a drink from the dipper on the forbidden side of a water fountain in a public park, "I'd just take a drink of the white water," she said. "It didn't taste any different."
She has always been more confrontational than her sister, she said, and more bitter about the plight of her people.
"When the Surrender happened," she said, referring to the end of the Civil War, "the poor whites gradually took over the barber shops, even the dance calling -- all the work that had been done by Negroes." Only women could get jobs then, as maids.
It is a source of considerable pride to the Delany sisters that neither of them ever worked for white people. (In their book, Bessie Delany addresses a message to David Duke: "This is just to set the record straight. I am a Negro woman. I was brought up in a good family. My Papa was a devoted father. I went to college; I paid my own way. I am not stupid. I'm not on welfare. And I'm not scrubbing floors. Especially not yours.")
After going as far as they could at St. Augustine's, they worked for years as teachers to earn the money for college because their father counseled against accepting scholarships that would leave them obligated to benefactors. With tuition in hand, they finally moved to New York and attended Columbia University, where Bessie Delany graduated with a D.D.S. in 1923 and Sadie Delany earned a master's degree in education in 1925.
Bessie Delany became so well known in Harlem that postcards addressed to "Dr. Bessie, New York City" somehow found their way to her. She charged $2 for a cleaning and $10 for a gold filling, never turning away those who could not pay and running something of a social-services office along with her dental practice.
Sadie Delany got the teaching post she wanted after working with a speech coach to change the southern accent that was often cited as the rationale for keeping black teachers from teaching white students. Even then, she said, she had to "sneak" into the school where she was assigned, based on her top marks on a teaching exam: She decided not to show up for the job interview, sure she would be turned away because of her race. Instead, she sent a letter to school administrators explaining that there had been some mix-up, and simply showed up on the first day of school.
 
Finishing Thoughts
 Both sisters chose a career over a family, never thinking that it was possible to do both and apparently never regretting the decision.
"I was very attracted to some of my beaux, but they knew I wasn't going to change and get married because I had decided to go into dentistry," Bessie Delany said. "I wasn't a play person."
"Bessie was a nice girl," her sister put in.
"And you can't eat everything you see," Bessie Delany concluded, as the sisters shared a long laugh.
They have probably lived this long, they say, because they have not had husbands to worry them to death.
Until Sadie Delany broke her hip in June, they had been in the habit of rising at 6:30 A.M. for yoga. They sleep in until 7 now, when they get up for a breakfast of oatmeal, half a banana, bran and eggs prepared with water and pepper -- no salt -- and a little grated cheese.
"You must stir it, stir it, stir it creamy like a custard," said Bessie Delany, suddenly jumping up to get the jar of chopped garlic that they dip into every morning.
"And that will last you all day," said Sadie Delany, finishing her sister's thought.
After morning prayers, when the sisters call the names of all those they either hold dear or think could use some help, they have a quiet time for reading before their noon meal, which might include a half-dozen vegetables.
 
Listening to Talk Radio
 The mail arrives at 1 P.M. -- an important daily event, since they refuse to get a phone -- and in the afternoon, they pay bills, answer correspondence and take a short walk. Supper is usually just a milkshake, though sometimes they have jello made with wine, or some other treat, before going upstairs to watch the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour. And long after her sister turns in, Bessie Delany stays up late listening to talk radio.
The issues that concern them most range from the national deficit to bad parenting. ("It makes me mad these people who have one child and they don't even comb their hair," Bessie Delany said. "My mama washed all 10 of us every day in a tub and changed the water for every one.")
They are not keen on doctors, and did not even have a primary physician until Sadie Delany's fall.
Most of them "don't know what to do with us," she said, as if speaking about a group of pitiably slow students. "When something's wrong they say, 'You're still living, what do you expect?' " Still, she adds playfully, "the gentleman who came to teach me to use the walker had the softest hands."
Bessie Delany is a great admirer of Hillary Clinton and her work on health care reform, calling her "the power behind the throne" and "the first lady in the White House I've paid attention to since Eleanor Roosevelt."
When the sisters talk about how the book has changed their lives, they don't talk about money (and neither does their agent).
What Bessie Delany does talk about is how her perspective on race relations has been changed somewhat since the experience of publishing the book has brought her in contact with white people who, in a world of enduring social segregation, she would not otherwise have had the chance to know.
"Just since we started this book, we met them," she said.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Transcript of President's Address to Congress on Health Care

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's address to a joint session of Congress last night on his plan to overhaul the nation's health care system, as recorded by The New York Times.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, members of Congress, distinguished guests, my fellow Americans: Before I begin my words tonight, I would like to ask that we all bow in a moment of silent prayer for the memory of those who were killed and those who have been injured in the tragic train accident in Alabama today. 
 My fellow Americans, tonight we come together to write a new chapter in the American story.
Our forebears enshrined the American dream -- life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. Every generation of Americans has worked to strengthen that legacy, to make our country a place of freedom and opportunity, a place who ---- where people who work hard can rise to their full potential and a place where their children can have a better future.
From the settling of the frontier to the landing on the moon, ours has been a continuous story of challenges defined, obstacles overcome, new horizons secured. That is what makes America what it is and Americans what we are.
Now we are in a time of profound change and opportunity. The end of the cold war, the information age, the global economy have brought us both opportunity and hope and strife and uncertainty.
Our purpose in this dynamic age must be to change, to make change our friend and not our enemy.
To achieve that goal, we must face all our challenges with confidence, with faith and with discipline, whether we're reducing the deficit, creating tomorrow's jobs and training our people to fill them, converting from a high-tech defense to a high-tech domestic economy, expanding trade, reinventing government, making our streets safer or rewarding work over idleness. All these challenges require us to change.
If Americans are to have the courage to change in a difficult time, we must first be secure in our most basic needs.
 
Fixing a Broken System
 Tonight I want to talk to you about the most critical thing we can do to build that security.
This health care system of ours is badly broken and it is time to fix it.
Despite the dedication of literally millions of talented health care professionals, our health care is too uncertain and too expensive, too bureaucratic and too wasteful. It has too much fraud and too much greed.
At long last, after decades of false starts, we must make this our most urgent priority: giving every American health security, health care that can never be taken away, health care that is always there. That is what we must do tonight.
On this journey, as on all others of true consequence, there will be rough spots in the road and honest disagreements about how we should proceed. After all, this is a complicated issue. But every successful journey is guided by fixed stars, and if we can agree on some basic values and principles, we will reach this destination and we will reach it together.
So tonight I want to talk to you about the principles that I believe must embody our efforts to reform America's health care system:
Security, simplicity, savings, choice, quality and responsibility.
When I launched our nation on this journey to reform the health care system, I knew we needed a talented navigator -- someone with a rigorous mind, a steady compass, a caring heart. Luckily for me and for our nation I didn't have to look very far.
 
700,000 Letters
 Over the last eight months, Hillary and those working with her have talked to literally thousands of Americans to understand the strengths and the frailties of this system of ours. They met with over 1,100 health care organizations. They talked with doctors and nurses, pharmacists and drug company representatives, hospital administrators, insurance company executives and small and large businesses. They spoke with self-employed people. They talked with people who had insurance and people who didn't. They talked with union members and older Americans and advocates for our children.
The First Lady also consulted, as all of you know, extensively with governmental leaders in both parties, in the states of our nation and especially here on Capitol Hill. Hillary and the task force received and read over 700,000 letters from ordinary citizens. What they wrote and the bravery with which they told their stories is really what calls us all here tonight. Every one of us knows someone who's worked hard and played by the rules and still been hurt by this system that just doesn't work for too many people.
Kerry Kennedy owns a small furniture store that employs seven people in Titusville, Fla. Like most small business owners, he's poured his heart and soul, his sweat and blood into that business for years. But over the last several years, again like most small business owners, he's seen his health care premiums skyrocket, even in years when no claims were made. And last year he painfully discovered he could no longer afford to provide coverage for all his workers because his insurance company told him that two of his workers had become high risks because of their advanced age. The problem was that those two people were his mother and father, the people who founded the business and still worked in the store.
This story speaks for millions of others, and from them we have learned a powerful truth: We have to preserve and strengthen what is right with the health care system, but we have got to fix what is wrong with it.
 
No Ignoring What Is Wrong
 We all know what's right. We're blessed with the best health care professionals on earth, the finest health care institutions, the best medical research, the most sophisticated technology.
My mother is a nurse. I grew up around hospitals. Doctors and nurses were the first professional people I ever knew or learned to look up to. They are what is right with this health care system. But we also know that we can no longer afford to continue to ignore what is wrong.
Millions of Americans are just a pink slip away from losing their health insurance, and one serious illness away from losing all their savings. Millions more are locked into the jobs they have now just because they or someone in their family had once been sick and they have what is called a pre-existing condition. And on any given day, over 37 million Americans -- most of them working people and their little children -- have no health insurance at all. And in spite of all this, our medical bills are growing at over twice the rate of inflation, and the United States spends over a third more of its income on health care than any other nation on earth. And the gap is growing, causing many of our companies in global competition severe disadvantage.
There is no excuse for this kind of system. We know other people have done better. We know people in our own country are doing better. We have no excuse.
My fellow Americans, we must fix this system, and it has to begin with Congressional action.
I believe as strongly as I can say that we can reform the costliest and most wasteful system on the face of the earth without enacting new broad-based taxes. I believe -- I believe it because of the conversations I have had with thousands of health care professionals around the country, with people who are outside this city but are inside experts on the way this system works and wastes money.
The proposal that I describe tonight borrows many of the principles and ideas that have been embraced in plans introduced by both Republicans and Democrats in this Congress. For the first time in this century leaders of both political parties have joined together around the principle of providing universal, comprehensive health care. It is a magic moment, and we must seize it.
I want to say to all of you, I have been deeply moved by the spirit of this debate, by the openness of all people to new ideas and argument and information. The American people would be proud to know that earlier this week when a health care university was held for members of Congress, just to try to give everybody the same amount of information, over 320 Republicans and Democrats signed up, and showed up, for two days just to learn the basic facts of the complicated problem before us. Both sides are willing to say: "We have listened to the people. We know the cost of going forward with this system is far greater than the cost of change."
 
An Ethical Imperative
 Both sides, I think, understand the literal ethical imperative of doing something about the system we have now. Rising above these difficulties and our past differences to solve this problem will go a long way toward defining who we are and who we intend to be as a people in this difficult and challenging era. I believe we all understand that.
And so tonight let me ask all of you: every member of the House, every member of the Senate, each Republican and each Democrat. Let us keep this spirit and let us keep this commitment until this job is done. We owe it to the American people.
Now if I might, I would like to review the six principles I mentioned earlier and describe how we think we can best fulfill those principles.
First and most important, security. This principle speaks to the human misery, to the costs, to the anxiety we hear about every day -- all of us -- when people talk about their problems with the present system.
Security means that those who do not now have health care coverage will have it. And for those who have it, it will never be taken away. We must achieve that security as soon as possible.
Under our plan every American would receive a health care security card that will guarantee a comprehensive package of benefits over the course of an entire lifetime roughly comparable to the benefit package offered by most Fortune 500 companies.
This health care security card will offer this package of benefits in a way that can never be taken away. So let us agree on this: whatever else we disagree on, before this Congress finishes its work next year, you will pass and I will sign legislation to guarantee this security to every citizen of this country.
 
Guarantee of Coverage
 With this card, if you lose your job or you switch jobs, you're covered. If you leave your job to start a small business, you're covered. If you're an early retiree, you're covered. If someone in your family has unfortunately had an illness that qualifies as a pre-existing condition, you're still covered. If you get sick or a member of your family gets sick, even if it's a life-threatening illness, you're covered. And if an insurance company tries to drop you for any reason, you'll still be covered because that will be illegal.
This card will give comprehensive coverage. It will cover people for hospital care, doctor visits, emergency and lab services, diagnostic services like pap smears and mammograms and cholesterol tests, substance abuse and mental health treatment.
And equally important for both health care and economic reasons, this program, for the first time, would provide a broad range of preventive services, including regular checkups and well-baby visits.
Now it's -- it's just common sense. We know any family doctor will tell you that people will stay healthier and long-term costs to the health system will be lower if we have comprehensive preventive services. You know how all of our mothers told us that an ounce of prevention was worth a pound of cure? Our mothers were right.
And it's a lesson, like so many lessons from our mothers, that we have waited too long to live by. It is time to start doing it.
 
Providing Prescription Drugs
 Health care security must also apply to older Americans. This is something I imagine all of us in this room feel very deeply about. So the first thing I want to say about that is that we must maintain the Medicare program -- it works to provide that kind of security. But this time, and for the first time, I believe Medicare should provide coverage for the cost of prescription drugs. Yes, it will cost some more in the beginning. But again, any physician who deals with the elderly will tell you that there are thousands of elderly people in every state who are not poor enough to be on Medicaid but just above that line and on Medicare, who desperately need medicine, who make decisions every week between medicine and food.
Any doctor who deals with the elderly will tell you that there are many elderly people who don't get medicine, who get sicker and sicker and eventually go to the doctor and wind up spending more money and draining more money from the health care system than they would if they had regular treatment in a way that only adequate medicine can provide.
I also believe that over time we should phase in long-term care for the disabled and the elderly on a comprehensive basis.
 
Toward a Simpler System
 As we proceed with this health care reform, we cannot forget that the most rapidly growing percentage of Americans are those over 80. We cannot break faith with them. We have to do better by them.
The second principle is simplicity. Our health care system must be simpler for the patients and simpler for those who actually deliver health care: our doctors, our nurses, our other medical professionals. Today we have more than 1,500 insurers with hundreds and hundreds of different forms. No other nation has a system like this. These forms are time-consuming for health care providers. They're expensive for health care consumers. They're exasperating for anyone who's ever tried to sit down around a table and wade through them and figure them out. The medical care industry is literally drowning in paperwork. In recent years the number of administrators in our hospitals has grown by four times the rate that the number of doctors has grown.
A hospital ought to be a house of healing, not a monument to paperwork and bureaucracy.
 
Losing Care to Paperwork
 Just a few days ago the Vice President and I had the honor of visiting the Children's Hospital here in Washington where they do wonderful, often miraculous, things for very sick children. A nurse named Debbie Freiberg told us that she was in the cancer and bone marrow unit and the other day a little boy asked her just to stay at his side during his chemotherapy. And she had to walk away from that child because she had been instructed to go to yet another class to learn how to fill out another form for something that didn't have a lick to do with the health care of the children she was helping. That is wrong and we can stop it, and we ought to do it.
We met a very compelling doctor named Lillian Beard, a pediatrician, who said that she didn't get into her profession to spend hours and hours -- some doctors up to 25 hours a week -- just filling out forms. She told us she became a doctor to keep children well and to help save those who got sick. We can relieve people like her of this burden. We learned, the Vice President and I did, that in the Washington Children's Hospital alone, the administrators told us they spend $2 million a year, in one hospital, filling out forms that have nothing whatever to do with keeping up with the treatment of the patient. And the doctors there applauded when I was told, and I related to them, that they spend so much time filling out paperwork that if they only had to fill out those paperwork requirements necessary to monitor the health of the children, each doctor on that one hospital staff, 200 of them, could see another 500 children a year. That is 10,000 children a year.
I think we can save money in this system if we simplify it and we can make the doctors and the nurses and the people that have given their lives to help us all be healthier -- a whole lot happier, too -- on their jobs.
Under our proposal there would be one standard insurance form, not hundreds of them. We will simplify also -- and we must -- the government's rules and regulations, because they are a big part of this problem.
This is one of those cases where the physician should heal thyself. We have to reinvent the way we relate to the health care system along with reinventing government. A doctor should not have to check with a bureaucrat in an office thousands of miles away before ordering a simple blood test. That's not right and we can change it.
And doctors, nurses and consumers shouldn't have to worry about the fine print. If we have this one simple form there won't be any fine print. People will know what it means.
 
Toward Savings in the System
 The third principle is savings.
Reform must produce savings in this health care system -- it has to. We are spending over 14 percent of our income on health care; Canada's at 10; nobody else is over 9. We're competing with all these people for the future and the other major countries, they cover everybody. And they cover them with services as generous as the best company policies here in this country.
Rampant medical inflation is eating away at our wages, our savings, our investment capital, our ability to create new jobs in the private sector and this public treasury.
You know the budget we just adopted had steep cuts in defense, a five-year freeze on the discretionary spending so critical to reeducating America and investing in jobs and helping us to convert from a defense to a domestic economy. But we passed the budget, which has Medicaid increases of between 16 and 11 percent a year over the next five years and Medicare increases of between 11 and 9 percent in an environment where we assume inflation will be at 4 percent or less.
We cannot continue to do this. Our competitiveness, our whole economy, the integrity of the way the Government works, and ultimately our living standards, depend upon our ability to achieve savings without harming the quality of health care. Unless we do this, our workers will lose $655 in income each year by the end of the decade. Small businesses will continue to face skyrocketing premiums, and a full third of small businesses now covering their employees say they will be forced to drop their insurance.
Large corporations will bear bigger disadvantages in global competition, and health care costs will devour more and more and more of our budget. Pretty soon all of you or the people who succeed you will be showing up here, and writing out checks for health care and interest on the debt and worrying about whether we've got enough defense, and that'll be it unless we have the courage to achieve the savings that are plainly there before us. Every state and local government will continue to cut back on everything from education to law enforcement to pay more and more for the same health care.
These rising costs are a special nightmare for our small businesses, the engine of our entrepreneurship and our job creation in American today. Health care premiums for small businesses are 35 percent higher than those of large corporations today, and they will keep rising at double-digit rates unless we act.
 
Depending on Competition
So how will we achieve these savings? Rather than looking at price controls, or looking away as the price spiral continues, rather than using the heavy hand of Government to try to control what's happening or continuing to ignore what's happening, we believe there is a third way to achieve these savings.
First, to give groups of consumers and small businesses the same market bargaining power that large corporations and large groups of public employees now have.
We want to let market forces enable plans to compete. We want to force these plans to compete on the basis of price and quality, not simply to allow them to continue making money by turning people away who are sick or old, or performing mountains of unnecessary procedures. But we also believe we should back this system up with limits on how much plans can raise their premiums year in and year out, forcing people again to continue to pay more for the same health care without regard to inflation or the rising population needs.
We want to create what has been missing in this system for too long, and what every successful nation who has dealt with this problem has already had to do: To have a combination of private market forces and a sound public policy that will support that competition but limit the rate at which prices can exceed the rate of inflation and population growth, if the competition doesn't work, especially in the early going.
The second thing I want to say is, that unless everybody is covered -- and this is a very important thing -- unless everybody is covered, we will never be able to fully put the brakes on health care inflation. Why is that? Because when people don't have any health insurance they still get health care, but they get it when it's too late, when it's too expensive, often from the most expensive place of all, the emergency room.
 
Simplifying the System
 Usually by the time they show up, their illnesses are more severe and their mortality rates are much higher in our hospitals than those who have insurance. So they cost us more.
And what else happens? Since they get the care but they don't pay, who does pay? All the rest of us. We pay in higher hospital bills and higher insurance premiums. This cost shifting is a major problem.
Third thing we can do to save money is simply by simplifying the system -- what we've already discussed. Freeing the health care providers from these costly and unnecessary paperwork and administrative decisions will save tens of billions of dollars. We spend twice as much as any other major country does on paperwork. We spend at least a dime on the dollar more than any other major country. That is a stunning statistic. It is something that every Republican and every Democrat ought to be able to say, "We agree that we're going to squeeze this out. We cannot tolerate this. This has nothing to do with keeping people well or helping them when they're sick. We should invest the money in something else."
We also have to crack down on fraud and abuse in the system. That drains millions of dollars a year. It is a very large figure, according to every health care expert I've ever spoken to. So I believe we can achieve large savings. And that large savings can be used to cover the unemployed uninsured and will be used for people who realize those savings in the private sector to increase their ability to invest and grow, to hire new workers or to give their workers pay raises, many for the first time in years.
 
Litany of Success Stories
 Now, nobody has to take my word for this. You can ask Dr. Koop. He's up here with us tonight, and I thank him for being here. Thank you, sir.
Since -- since he left his distinguished tenure as our Surgeon General, he has spent an enormous amount of time studying our health care system -- how it operates, what's right and wrong with it. He says we could spend $200 billion every year -- more than 20 percent of the total budget -- without sacrificing the high quality of American medicine.
Ask the public employees in California who've held their own premiums down by adopting the same strategy that I want every American to be able to adopt: bargaining within the limits of a strict budget.
Ask Xerox which saved an estimated $1,000 per worker on their health insurance premiums.
Ask the staff of the Mayo Clinic, who we all agree provides some of the finest health care in the world. They are holding their cost increases to less than half the national average.
Ask the people of Hawaii, the only state that covers virtually all of their citizens and has still been able to keep costs below the national average.
Now, people may disagree over the best way to fix this system. We may all disagree about how quickly we can do what -- the thing that we have to do. But we cannot disagree that we can find tens of billions of dollars in savings in what is clearly the most costly and the most bureaucratic system in the entire world. And we have to do something about that, and we have to do it now.
The fourth principle is choice. Americans believe they ought to be able to choose their own health care plan and keep their own doctors. And I think all of us agree. Under any plan we pass they ought to have that right. But today under our broken health care system, in spite of the rhetoric of choice, the fact is that that power is slipping away from more and more Americans. Of course it is usually the employer, not the employee, who makes the initial choice of what health care plan the employee will be in. And if your employer offers only one plan, as nearly three-quarters of small and medium-size firms do today, you're stuck with that plan and the doctors that it covers. We propose to give every American a choice among high-quality plans. You can stay with your current doctor, join a network of doctors and hospitals or join a health maintenance organization. If you don't like your plan, every year you'll have the chance to choose a new one. The choice will be left to the American citizen, the worker, not the boss and certainly not some government bureaucrat.
We also believe that doctors should have a choice as to what plans they practice in. Otherwise, citizens may have their own choices limited. We want to end the discrimination that is now growing against doctors and to permit them to practice in several different plans. Choice is important for doctors and it is absolutely critical for our consumers.
We've got to have it, in whatever plan we pass.
 
Report Cards for Health Plans
 The fifth principle is quality. If we reformed everything else in health care but failed to preserve and enhance the high quality of our medical care, we will have taken a step backward, not forward. Quality is something that we simply can't leave to chance. When you board an airplane, you feel better knowing that the plane had to meet standards designed to protect your safety. And we can't ask any less of our health care system.
Our proposal will create report cards on health plans so that consumers can choose the highest-quality health care providers and reward them with their business. At the same time, our plan will track quality indicators so that doctors can make better and smarter choices of the kind of care they provide.
We have evidence that more efficient delivery of health care doesn't decrease quality; in fact, it may enhance it. Let me just give you one example of one commonly performed procedure, the coronary bypass operation. Pennsylvania discovered that patients who were charged $21,000 for this surgery received as good or better care as patients who were charged $84,000 for the same procedure in the same state.
High prices simply don't always equal good quality. Our plan will guarantee that high-quality information is available in even the most remote areas of this country so that we can have high-quality service, linking rural doctors, for example, with hospitals with high-tech urban medical centers. And our plan will insure the quality of continuing progress on a whole range of issues by speeding research on effective prevention and treatment measures for cancer, for AIDS, for Alzheimer's, heart disease, and for other chronic diseases. We have to safeguard the finest medical research establishment in the entire world, and we will do that with this plan. Indeed, we will even make it better.
 
Emphasizing Responsibility
 The sixth and final principle is responsibility.
We need to restore a sense that we're all in this together and that we all have a responsibility to be a part of the solution. Responsibility has to start with those who profit from the current system.
Responsibility means insurance companies should no longer be allowed to cast people aside when they get sick.
It should apply to laboratories that submit fraudulent bills; to lawyers who abuse malpractice claims; to doctors who order unnecessary procedures.
It means drug companies should no longer charge three times more for prescription drugs made in America -- here in the United States -- than they charge for the same drugs overseas.
In short, responsibility should apply to anybody who abuses this system and drives up the cost for honest, hard-working citizens and undermines confidence in the honest, gifted health care providers we have.
Responsibility also means changing some behaviors in this country that drive up our cost like crazy and without change in them we'll never have the system we ought to have. We will never.
Let me just mention a few and start with the most important.
The outrageous costs of violence in this country stem in large measure from the fact that this is the only country in the world where teen-agers can walk the streets at random with semiautomatic weapons and be better armed than the police.
Let's not kid ourselves. It's not that simple. We also have higher rates of AIDS, of smoking and excessive drinking, of teen pregnancy, of low-birth-weight babies, and we have the third-worst immunization rate of any nation in the Western hemisphere. We have to change our ways if we ever really want to be healthy as a people and have an affordable health care system. And no one could deny that.
But let me say this -- and I hope every American will listen -- because this is not an easy thing to hear. Responsibility in our health care system isn't just about them. It's about you. It's about me. It's about each of us. Too many of us have not taken responsibility for our own health care and for our own relations to the health care system. Many of us who've had fully paid health care plans have used the system whether we needed it or not without thinking what the costs were. Many people who use this system don't pay a penny for their care even though they can afford to. I think those who don't have any health insurance should be responsible for paying a portion of their new coverage. There can't be any something for nothing, and we have to demonstrate that to people. This is not a free system.
 
'We Have to Pay For It'
 Even small contributions -- as small as a $10 co-payment when you visit a doctor -- illustrates that this is something of value; there is a cost to it; it is not free.
And I want to tell you that I believe that all of us should have insurance. Why should the rest of us pick up the tab when a guy who doesn't think he needs insurance or says he can't afford it gets in an accident, winds up in an emergency room, gets good care and everybody else pays?
Why should the small-business people, who are struggling to keep afloat and take care of their employees, have to pay to maintain this wonderful health care infrastructure for those who refuse to do anything?
If we're going to produce a better health care system for every one of us, every one of us is going to have to do our part. There cannot be any such thing as a free ride. We have to pay for it. We have to pay for it.
Tonight I want to say plainly how I think we should do that. Most of the money we will -- that would come, under my way of thinking as it does today, from premiums paid by employers and individuals. That's the way it happens today.
But under this health care security plan every employer and every individual will be asked to contribute something to health care. This concept was first conveyed to the Congress about 20 years ago by President Nixon. And today a lot of people agree with the concept as shared responsibility between employers and employees. And that the best thing to do is to ask every employer and every employee to share them.
The Chamber of Commerce has said that and they're not in the business of hurting small busness. The American Medical Association has said that. Some call it an employer mandate, but I think it's the fairest way to achieve responsibility in the health care system, and it's the easiest for ordinary Americans to understand because it builds on what we already have and what already works for so many Americans. It is the reform that is not only easiest to understand but easiest to implement in a way that is fair to small business, because we can give a discount to help struggling small businesses meet the cost of covering their employees. We should require the least bureaucracy or disruption and create the cooperation we need to make the system cost conscious even if we expand coverage. And we should do it in a way that does not cripple small businesses and low-wage workers.
Every employer should provide coverage, just as three-quarters do now. Those who pay are picking up the tab for those who don't today. I don't think that's right.
To finance the rest of reforms, we can achieve new savings as I have outlined both the Federal Government and the private sector through better decision-making and increased competition. And we will impose new taxes on tobacco.
 
Testing All the Numbers
 I also -- I don't think that should be the only source of revenues. I believe we should also ask for a modest contribution from big employers who opt out of the system, to make up for what those who are in the system pay for medical research, for health education centers, for all the subsidies to small business, for all the things that everyone else is contributing to. But between those two things, we believe we can pay for this package of benefits and universal coverage and a subsidy program that will help small business.
These sources can cover the costs of the proposal that I have described tonight. We subjected the numbers in our proposal to the scrutiny not only of all the major agencies in Government -- I know a lot of people don't trust them, but it would be interesting for the American people to know that this was the first time that the financial experts on health care and all of the different Government agencies had ever been required to sit in a room together and agree on numbers. It had never happened before.
But obviously that's not enough. So then we gave these numbers to actuaries from major accounting firms and major Fortune 500 companies who have no stake in this other than to see that our efforts succeed. So I believe our numbers are good and achievable.
Now what does this mean to an individual American citizen?
 
'We Can All Win'
 Some will be asked to pay more. If you're an employer and you aren't insuring your workers at all, you'll have to pay more. But if you're a small business with fewer than 50 employees, you'll get a subsidy. If you're a firm that provides only very limited coverage, you may have to pay more, but some firms will pay the same or less for more coverage.
If you're a young, single person in your 20's and you're already insured, your rates may go up somewhat because you're going to go into a big pool with middle-aged people and older people, and we want to enable people to keep their insurance even when someone in their family gets sick. But I think that's fair because when the young get older, they'll benefit from it, first, and secondly even those who pay a little more today will benefit four, five, six, seven years from now by our bringing health care costs closer to inflation. Over the long run we can all win, but some will have to pay more in the short run.
Nevertheless, the vast majority of the Americans watching this tonight will pay the same or less for health care coverage that will be the same or better than the coverage they have tonight. That is the central reality.
If you currently get your health insurance through your job, under our plan you still will. And for the first time, everybody will get to choose from among at least three plans to belong to.
If you're a small-business owner who wants to provide health insurance to your family and your employees but you can't afford it because the system is stacked against you, this plan will give you a discount that will finally make insurance affordable.
If you're already providing insurance, your rates may well drop because we'll help you as a small business person join thousands of others to get the same benefits big corporations get at the same price they get those benefits.
If you're self-employed, you'll pay less, and you'll get to deduct from your taxes a hundred percent of your health care premiums.
If you're a large employer, your health care costs won't go up as fast. So that you will have more money to put into higher wages and new jobs and to put into the work of being competitive in this tough global economy.
Now these, my fellow Americans, are the principles on which I think we should base our efforts: security, simplicity, savings, choice, quality and responsibility. These are the guiding stars that we should follow on our journey toward health care reform.
 
The Cost of Rejecting Change
 Over the coming months, you'll be bombarded with information from all kinds of sources. There will be some who will stoutly disagree with what I have proposed and with all other plans in the Congress, for that matter.
And some of the arguments will be genuinely sincere and enlightening. Others may simply be scare tactics by those who are motivated by the self-interest they have in the waste the system now generates because that waste is providing jobs, incomes and money for some people.
I ask you only to think of this: when you hear all of these arguments ask yourself whether the cost of staying on this same course isn't greater than the cost of change, and ask yourself when you hear the arguments whether the arguments are in your interest or someone else's.
This is something we have got to try to do together.
I want also to say to the representatives in Congress, you have a special duty to look beyond these arguments. I ask you instead to look into the eyes of a sick child who needs care.
To think of the face of the woman whose been told not only that her condition is malignant but not covered by her insurance.
To look at the bottom lines of the businesses driven to bankruptcy by health care costs.
To look at the for-sale signs in front of the homes of families who've lost everything because of their health care costs.
I ask you to remember the kind of people I met for the last year and a half:
The elderly couple in New Hampshire that broke down and cried because of their shame at having an empty refrigerator to pay for their drugs.
The woman who lost a $50,000 job that she used to support her six children because her youngest child was so ill that she couldn't keep health insurance, and the only way to get care for the child was to get public assistance.
A young couple that had a sick child and could only get insurance from one of the parents' employers that was a nonprofit corporation with 20 employees. And so they had to face the question of whether to let this poor person with a sick child go or raise the premiums of every employee in the firm by $200.
And on and on and on.
I know we have differences of opinion, but we are here tonight in a spirit that is animated by the problems of those people, and by the sure knowledge that if we can look into our hearts, we will not be able to say that the greatest nation in the history of the world is powerless to confront this crisis.
Our history and our heritage tell us that we can meet this challenge. Everything about America's past tells us we will do it. So I say to you, let us write that new chapter in the American story, let us guarantee every American comprehensive health benefits that can never be taken away.
 
Answering Call of History
 In spite of all the work we've done together and all the progress we've made, there are still a lot of people who say it would be an outright miracle if we pass health care reform. But, my fellow Americans, in a time of change, you have to have miracles. And miracles do happen.
I mean, just a few days ago, we saw a simple handshake shatter decades of deadlock in the Middle East.
We've seen the walls crumble in Berlin and South Africa. We see the ongoing brave struggle of the people of Russia to seize freedom and democracy.
And now it is our turn to strike a blow for freedom in this country. The freedom of Americans to live without fear that their own nation's health care system won't be there for them when they need it.
It's hard to believe that there was once a time, in this century, when that kind of fear gripped old age, when retirement was nearly synonymous with poverty, and older Americans died in the street.
That's unthinkable today, because over a half a century ago Americans had the courage to change, to create a social security system that insures that no Americans will be forgotten in their later years.
Forty years from now, our grandchildren will also find it unthinkable that there was a time in this country when hard-working families lost their homes, their savings, their businesses -- lost everything simply because their children got sick or because they had to change jobs.
Our grandchildren will find such things unthinkable tomorrow if we have the courage to change today.
This is our chance. This is our journey. And when our work is done, we will know that we have answered the call of history and met the challenge of our time.
Thank you very much, and God bless America.

Chart: "The Vocabulary of Health Care"
 
EMPLOYER MANDATE: The Clinton plan's requirement that employers pay at least 80 percent of the cost of health coverage for their workers.
 
GUARANTEED NATIONAL BENEFIT PACKAGE: The standard comprehensive coverage that all Americans would receive under the President's proposal.
 
HEALTH ALLIANCES: Purchasing groups that, under the Clinton plan, would each buy health care services for thousands of consumers. The alliances would be of two types: regional health alliances, whose creation would be the states' responsibility, and corporate health alliances. A corporate alliance could be established by any large employer (in general, one with more than 5,000 workers). But these employers would have the option of joining a regional alliance instead.
 
HEALTH PLANS: The networks of doctors, hospitals and insurers that would provide coverage through contracts negotiated with regional or corporate alliances.
 
MANAGED COMPETITION: A policy, partly embraced by the President, that combines free-market forces with Government regulation. Large groups of consumers buy health care from networks of providers. The aim is to create business competition, thereby restraining prices and encouraging quality of care.
 
MEDICAID: The existing Federal-state program of health coverage for the poor. Under the Clinton plan, Medicaid beneficiaries would be folded into the health alliance system.
 
MEDICARE: The existing Federal program of health coverage for the elderly and the disabled. Under the Clinton plan, a state could apply to the Government for permission to include Medicare beneficiaries in the aliance system, and a person who was already included in an alliance upon turning 65 could remain.
 
NATIONAL HEALTH BOARD: A seven-member Federal panel that would be appointed by the President to oversee the states' creation of regional health alliances, interpret the guaranteed benefits package, enforce a national health care budget, monitor the quality of care and investigate pharmaceutical companies' prices for new drugs if evidence suggested prices were unreasonably high.
 
NATIONAL HEALTH SECURITY CARD: An identification card that would serve as proof of a person's eligibility for the Government-guaranteed package of benefits. All citizens and legal aliens would be eligible.
 
SINGLE-PAYER OPTION: A provision of the Clinton plan that a state would be allowed to enact as an alternative to the system of regional health alliances. Under this alternative, the state would make direct payments to health care providers, with no intermediaries.

 BODY:
Members of Congress registered strong support tonight for the outlines of President Clinton's plan to recast the nation's health care system, but many lawmakers immediately began to pick fights with details relating to expected increases in taxes and costs.
Republicans and Democrats gave the President repeated standing ovations, and appeared to agree that the present health care system was too expensive and did not cover everyone who deserved care. More importantly, members of both parties expressed hope that they could work in a spirit of bipartisanship to pass at least a modest change in the system by late next year. 
 "It's a great start on a long, tough journey," said Senator James Jeffords, a moderate Republican from Vermont. "He'll get the public on our backs to get the job done."
More conservative Republicans expressed strong concern that the proposed health system would create bureaucratic snarls and put undue financial pressures on small businesses that would be required to provide employees with health insurance. But even they praised Mr. Clinton for beginning a debate on a problem that no recent President had attempted to tackle.
As the President completed his speech, several lawmakers said it was the best of his young Presidency, mixing compassionate liberalism with hard-headed, market-based solutions.
Still, several fault lines emerged that may make consensus difficult to reach on issues like comprehensive coverage and cost controls. Some liberal Democrats continued to call for a Canadian-style system in which a single Government agency would make direct payments to health care providers with no intermediaries, while several conservative Republicans strongly opposed what they viewed as proposals to microregulate an industry that makes up one-seventh of the economy.
"It was an outstanding call for action," said Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. "But as I see it there are two deal breakers: How do you control costs, and how do you pick up 37 million Americans who have no health insurance while you reduce costs?"
Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, seemed to sum up the concerns about the costs of the proposed overhaul when he said, "We're not paying for our entitlements now, and we're starting to talk about instituting another entitlement without paying for it."
Representative Henry A. Waxman of California, a key liberal Democratic leader on health care as chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment, expressed reservations about the proposed reductions in Medicare payments to hospitals and doctors. "This plan is not perfect," he said.
But he called the speech "a courageous first step" to create a system of universal health insurance coverage. "The President," he said, "has skillfully woven a compromise that provides the blueprint we need to move forward. He has committed the focus and leadership we need to truly achieve health security for all Americans."
Most Republicans were sharply critical of the major tenets of the President's plan, although a few offered faint praise.
"I agree with his objectives," said Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, "but I don't know quite how he'll take $200 billion out of Medicare and add prescription drugs."
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, congratulated the President for effectively outlining the need for change. But he criticized the plan for offering "a complex bureaucratic structure that could harm what is good in the present system and impose on American families a very complex system that cannot work efficiently, a maze in which individuals will be lost."
Senator Dave Durenberger, a moderate Minnesota Republican who the White House hopes will support much of the President's plan, said:, "That the President of the United States is ready to lead a fundamental, bipartisan reform of health care demonstrates how far we've come. We need someone to lead us."
Lobbying groups on both sides of the issue also expressed their views after the speech.
Stephen C. Cohen, president of the National Organization of Physicians Who Care, criticized the Clinton plan for "masquerading as patient-friendly while actually depriving patients of their most important rights."
The American Association of Retired Persons, one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington, commended Mr. Clinton for making health care a priority.

Corporate Economists Are Back

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Robert E. Hayes Jr., an economist for Kmart, is pondering such issues as floor-space planning and why his company so often frustrates customers by having no bathing suits for sale in July.
Constantine G. Soras is helping crank a 29 percent jump in cellular phone customers over the last year into the Nynex Corporation's 1994 budget. 
 And Bernard Lashinsky, a steel industry economist, takes encouragement about the economic outlook from three new shopping centers being built near his home in Skokie, Ill.
 
Expression of Confidence
 "It's time to expand," Mr. Lashinsky is telling his employer, Inland Steel. Sheet mills, he added, are running nearly flat out because of strong demand from the makers of cars and appliances. Caterpillar Inc., a major Inland customer, has had to allocate to customers some of the smaller machines it makes and the company must import some parts from Japan despite the high-valued yen.
Such varied concerns are the grist of the modern business economist, a vocation whose ranks have been thinned by corporate revampings in recent years and whose survivors are increasingly being called upon for practical and profit-oriented analysis, rather than for multiyear projections of gross domestic product.
Consumers are buying big-ticket items but are being stingy when it comes to smaller purchases, say economists gathered here for the annual convention of the National Association of Business Economists, confirming recent official reports on retail sales.
 
Modest Growth Foreseen
 The association's 275 members, who wrapped up their annual meeting with sessions on the quality of government statistics and on health care, generally agreed with the forecasting panel's expectation of continued modest growth in the United States.
But even as various sectors witness a pickup, the economy is restrained by lack of consumer confidence and by Washington's tax and regulatory initiatives, the economists say. Business must anticipate growth, these planners maintain, but it would be a mistake to place too big a bet.
The tax increases in the budget plan approved in the summer were reason for caution, many say, and any health care overhaul is likely to lead to an even bigger tax drag next year.
"I see signs of stronger economic growth ahead in the steel industry, and I'm moved to want to take advantage of it," said Norman B. Lefton, an economist who runs a family-owned scrap-metal business in East St. Louis, Ill. "But I'm stymied."
One reason is that he cannot afford health care for the nonunionized members of his 50-employee work force, he said. Another problem is finding people willing to drive trucks around his three yards for a starting wage of $6.42 an hour. He has three openings for drivers.
A third difficulty is the Lefton Iron and Metal Company's protracted inability to win approval from the government of the depressed city for passage across an unused alleyway so the company can build a 15-foot railroad spur that would connect one of its yards to the Norfolk Southern Railway.
This is thwarting expansion plans just as Mr. Lefton, for the first time in more than two years, is "even a tad optimistic" about prospects for the scrap metal business. Scrap is generally regarded as an early mover when economic momentum shifts.
At Kmart, Mr. Hayes grapples these days with floor space and where to put new stores, but he is also deepening the company's knowledge of the impact of hurricanes and floods -- probably greater than has been realized -- and monitoring the competition.
The bathing suit problem, however, is more easily identified than solved: The more a company depends on independent suppliers, especially when many of them are overseas, the less flexibility it has in matching merchandise with season, Mr. Hayes said.
At Nynex, the telephone company serving New York and most of New England, the predominant factor in the surging popularity of cellular phones is economic recovery rather than technology, fashion or even lower prices, Mr. Soras said. He disagreed strongly with what he said was perceived popular wisdom -- "Some people think the link between the telecommunications business and the economy has been broken."
Mr. Soras takes some satisfaction in having helped Nynex hold down financing costs last spring when it looked as though interest rates might have hit bottom.
 
A Rate Prediction
 "They were thinking of locking in the long-term rates, but I advised them not to," he said, noting that rates continued to move lower for several more months. Mr. Soras currently predicts that rates will "edge up."
In the oil business, which is enduring another period of slumping prices, the Exxon Corporation's economists in Texas and New Jersey spend increasing amounts of time on environmental and other regulatory matters involving large costs and risks, observed Elizabeth S. Webbink, a Houston-based staff economist engaged these days in applying the latest industry technology.
With colleagues involved in such microeconomic issues as contingency valuation and support of litigation, the profession's usefulness to senior management seems to be making a comeback.
"Economists are less likely to lose their jobs these days," Ms. Webbink said.

HEADLINE: Florio Attacks Tax-Cut Plan By Whitman

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PISCATAWAY, N.J., Sept. 22

 BODY:
Standing on a construction site, Gov. Jim Florio began tearing away today at the economic plan proposed by his Republican gubernatorial rival, Christine Todd Whitman.
"This isn't a plan -- it's a voodoo redo, said Mr. Florio, alluding to George Bush's phrase, "voodoo economics," his 1980 campaign criticism of the supply-side economics of Ronald Reagan on which Mrs. Whitman's plan is based. 
 After weeks of anticipation, Mrs. Whitman released a two-page economic plan on Tuesday that promised the most sweeping tax cuts in state history over the next three years, significant reductions in the size of government and the creation of 450,000 jobs.
A promise to cut taxes, like the one made by Mrs. Whitman, can be tricky business, if the history of past elections is any guide. To overcome the doubts of cynical voters, public-policy analysts say, Mrs. Whitman has to present a credible case that the state budget can be cut -- without damaging popular programs. [News analysis, page B6.]
 
Timed to Seize Offensive
 Despite a scarcity of details in the Whitman plan, her action may well become the pivotal point of the gubernatorial race. The announcement was timed to seize the offensive against Mr. Florio and to rekindle public anger over the record $2.8 billion tax increase the Governor pushed through the Legislature three years ago.
Mr. Florio took to the stump today in a bid to block Mrs. Whitman's maneuver, and in doing so he turned to what has become a familiar campaign strategy for him, trying to paint his rival as a wealthy candidate who is out of touch with the common voter.
"Under her proposal, 5.5 percent of the taxpayers get 40 percent of the benefit," Mr. Florio said. "For that 5.5 percent -- the richest 5.5 percent -- the average tax break is $4,534. For the 94.5 percent, the average tax break is $185."
Mr. Florio called the Whitman plan an insult to the intelligence of New Jerseyans.
"This two-page plan isn't about getting New Jersey through the next four years; it's about getting Christie Whitman through the next six weeks," Mr. Florio said at a news conference here at the site of a new football stadium for Rutgers University as he held aloft a copy of Mrs. Whitman's economic blueprint.
 
Politically Calculated Site
 The visit to the construction site was billed on the Governor's daily schedule as a tour of the stadium expansion project. But the choice of the venue was politically calculated.
Mrs. Whitman opposed the $224 million bond issue by the State Sports and Exposition Authority that financed the $28 million renovation of the stadium, including doubling its 20,000-seat capacity. With construction workers in hard hats and academics in business suits looking on, Mr. Florio reminded them today that Mrs. Whitman had opposed the plan.
"She's talking, and we're doing," he said. "I think, by now, most people know that the difficult decisions of 1990 included a tax increase. I hated raising taxes. But the past three years, we've balanced budgets, with no tax increases, and we've been creating jobs and investing in New Jersey."

U.S. to Speed Money to Bolster Yeltsin

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
Senior Clinton Administration officials and top American lawmakers agreed today that the $2.5 billion American aid package for Russia now being considered by Congress should move ahead quickly as a tangible sign of support for President Boris N. Yeltsin.
A day after Mr. Yeltsin dissolved Parliament and called new elections, the Clinton Administration has settled comfortably into a policy that officials summarize as business as usual with Mr. Yeltsin and the back of the hand for his opponents. The general feeling within the Administration was confidence that Mr. Yeltsin would prevail, coupled with a fasten-your-seat-belts attitude that this sort of power struggle is going to be a feature of political life in Russia for years to come. 
 President Clinton sent a message to every American embassy and consulate around the world asking American diplomats to speak with their host Governments in an effort to drum up support for Mr. Yeltsin.
On Thursday, a senior official said, the United States will be contacting all the former Soviet republics surrounding Russia and officially "seek their assurance that they will support the reformers" and particularly the Yeltsin team.
 
Double Endorsement
 "I think the United States has to be on the side of reform and democracy in Russia, and President Yeltsin represents that," Mr. Clinton said today, as he met with Congressional leaders to discuss his health care plan. It was his second endorsement of Mr. Yeltsin in 24 hours.
On Capitol Hill, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on operations, said he would try to secure Senate passage of a $2.5 billion supplementary Russian aid bill as quickly as possible. It has already passed the House. If it is passed by the Senate it would still have to go into conference so that a joint House-Senate version could be drafted before it becomes law.
"I met with the President last night and told him that I have every intention of going forward," Senator Leahy said. "I wanted to send a clear signal that the U.S. is moving ahead with this aid so there won't be any questions in Russia as to whether the United States is supporting a move toward democracy and a move toward a market economy. I don't want Yeltsin's opponents to think there is any slackening off."
 
Wrestling With the Old Order
 Mr. Leahy's House counterpart, David Obey of Wisconsin, the Democrat who is chairman of the House Foreign Affairs operations subcommittee, echoed that view.
"It makes our aid all the more imperative, because Yeltsin is wrestling with the remnants of the old order in the Congress, and one of their allies is continued economic turmoil and confusion," Mr. Obey said. "Therefore, the more help we can give him as he tries to wrestle with those economic dragons, the better chance he has of producing something that can hold."
The Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, said the suspension of Parliament came as a surprise to him even though Russia "has been on the brink of political crisis for some time."
"While it's not clear what the consequences of President Yeltsin's action will be, we know that Boris Yeltsin has been steadfastly committed to democracy and economic reform in Russia," Mr. Dole said in a statement.
 
A Constitutional Crisis
 The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell of Maine, said, "President Yeltsin's actions are consistent with the views of the overwhelming majority of the Russian people."
Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said he too supported continuing aid to Mr. Yeltsin's Government and Russian reformers, despite the recent upheavals.
"It has been clear for some time that you've got a constitutional crisis in Russia," Mr. Hamilton, an Indiana Democrat, said. "Their Constitution is unworkable and the new elections are the best way to achieve political stability and try to institutionalize democratic order. Last April's referendum, I think, stated the clear preference of the Russian people for early elections and for the Yeltsin reforms, and that is what our policy is out to support.
"With regard to our aid," added Mr. Hamilton, "I think the choice here is really very stark: Yeltsin favors democracy, the Parliament does not. Yeltsin favors market reform, the Parliament does not. Yeltsin favors an open society, the Parliament is pushing back toward the centralized state. We want to see Russia move in the direction of democracy and market reform. The purpose of our assistance is to foster that, and as long as Russia is moving in that general direction, even with some bumps along the way, that is what we ought to do."
 
Less Tension in Washington
 While lawmakers strongly supported continued aid to Russia, Administration officials said they had no intention of pressuring the International Monetary Fund to release the $1.5 billion in economic assistance it has been holding back because of the Yeltsin Government's failure to institute all the inflation-fighting measures it had promised. Officials said that aid was strictly a matter between Moscow and the fund.
Administration officials said the main reason they were more relaxed today was that it had become obvious that the Russian Army, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and the security services in Russia were all with Mr. Yeltsin, and American intelligence had spotted no worrisome internal troop movements.
"Basically, there are a lot of dogs that are not barking," said a senior Administration official.
Gen. John Shalikashvili, President Clinton's nominee as the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress that he believed Russian nuclear weapons were under control.
"In the past we have been gratified to find out that those weapons had remained under solid central control, and I have no indication that that is not the case at this moment," he said today at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW;
U.S. Offers a Trade to Help Japan Build Missile Defense

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 22

 BODY:
In a novel initiative to to correct the imbalance in its technological trade with Japan, the Clinton Administration proposed today to aid Tokyo in building a missile defense system in exchange for access to advanced commercial technologies that could help American industry.
The unusual proposal, described to Japanese officials here today by a senior Pentagon official, appears to represent the first time that the United States has offered to trade the fruits of its military research and development projects for technology that would be used primarily in non-military fields. 
 "This is part of a larger initiative," the official, John M. Deutch, who is Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, said today. "One of the dangers for our national security is from economic weakness. We are actively looking for ways to use defense to encourage dual-use technology that serves military and civilian purposes."
For years the Defense Department has been criticized for transferring vast amounts of know-how to Japan -- particularly in the building of aircraft, ships and other military technology that Japan produces under license -- and receiving very little in return. But it was unclear today how the Japanese Government would react to Mr. Deutch's proposal, which he called "new and adventuresome," and which he said would take some "patience" to negotiate.
 
Worry About North Korea
 The immediate issue for the Japanese is the building of a missile-defense system able to detect and intercept a new generation of missiles being constructed by the Communist Government in North Korea. The North tested its new missile, the Rodong 1, this summer, and the Pentagon has done little to allay Japan's fears about the potential of the North Korean missile project.
"We believe that currently North Korea has some capability in tactical ballistic missiles," Mr. Deutch said today. "And the possibility that these missiles can carry nuclear, chemical or biological weapons is one of the major security dangers of the future."
But the project Mr. Deutch was discussing appeared to be quite long-term. It would involve Japan deeply in the Pentagon's plans for research, over the next five years, on a "theater missile defense" program that would protect against regional threats around the world, similar to the one posed by North Korea. Such a program has become the much-scaled down successor to the Strategic Defense Initiative.
He gave few specifics about what the United States might get in return from Japan for such technologies, but said the main negotiations would have to occur between companies in the two countries, rather than just the Governments.
"When a framework for this is established, you would have U.S. firms working with Japanese firms," he said, citing several examples of technologies that might be imported from Japan for use in either military or commercial areas. Among them are flat-panel displays of the kind used in fighter jets and notebook computers, opto-electronics and composite materials. Japan is strong or considered in the lead in each of those areas.
Japanese military contractors, he said, would be encouraged to bring in subcontractors and arrange trade in some of their technologies. The United States, in return, has invested tens of billions of dollars in anti-ballistic-missile technology, and it would take years for Japan to catch up.
Getting the initiative off the ground would require the approval of the new coalition Government here and the cooperation of several competing Japanese bureaucracies, including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Defense Ministry. But the biggest objections may come from the left wing members of the coalition, including the Socialist Party, which has long objected to the 33-year-old Japan Security Treaty and any expansion of Japan's military ability.

HEADLINE: I.M.F., on Eve of Meeting, Cuts Forecast for World Economic Growth

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 22

 BODY:
With Germany and Japan in recession and the American economy continuing to stumble along, the International Monetary Fund forecast today that the world economy would grow more slowly over the next year than it had predicted just a few months ago.
On the eve of the I.M.F.'s annual meeting here, the fund predicted that the industrial world's economy would grow by a meager 1.1 percent this year, so slow that it would fuel trade protectionism and anti-immigrant sentiments in many countries. It also predicted growth of 2.2 percent for next year. In May, the fund had forecast growth of 1.7 percent for 1993 and 2.9 percent for 1994. 
 As for the entire global economy, the I.M.F. said it would expand at a 2.2 percent rate this year and 3.2 percent next year, pulled along by rapid growth in the nonindustrial countries, especially in Asia. In May, the fund's prediction for worldwide growth this year was the same, at 2.2 percent, but it saw a 3.4 percent expansion in 1994.
 
Urges More Action
 In today's report, the I.M.F. suggested that there was more room for Germany to cut its interest rates and for Japan to spend more money to stimulate its economy, beyond even the actions the countries took this month. The report said that Germany's output would fall by 1 percent this year, while Japan's would shrink by one-tenth of 1 percent.
The fund said that "further actions to ease monetary conditions across Europe" were "clearly necessary to stem recessionary forces and to insure recovery during 1994."
In its semiannual world economic outlook report, the fund said the United States economy would grow by 2.7 percent this year, the fastest rate among the major industrial nations, but it saw American growth slipping slightly to 2.6 percent next year.
The report said, "This year marks the fourth consecutive year of sub-par growth performance for the world economy, and indications of a resumption of stronger growth in 1994 are still tentative."
 
150 Nations Gathering
 At the I.M.F. meeting, which will bring together finance ministers and central bankers from more than 150 countries, the officials are expected to urge the industrial nations, especially Germany and Japan, to take more vigorous action to spur growth. Established in 1944 to foster cooperation on economic and monetary policy, the fund now devotes most of its energies to advising countries on putting their economic houses in order.
"Strong growth in many developing countries remains the most positive feature of the global situation," the report said, forecasting 13 percent growth in India this year and 9 percent growth in China.
On the sidelines of the I.M.F. meeting, the finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations are scheduled to meet Saturday. On their agenda are finding ways to speed world growth, aid to the former Soviet Union and aid to the Israeli-Occupied Territories to help the Middle East peace process. The officials are also expected to discuss ways to stabilize the Japanese yen, partly because Japanese officials worry that a new surge in the yen could hurt Japan's attempts at an economic rebound.
American officials say they are pleased with the state of cooperation among the seven nations, pointing to Germany's recent interest rate cuts and several recent stimulative moves announced by Japan. These include Tokyo's announcements of a $57 billion stimulus package and the Bank of Japan's decision to cut its discount rate to 1.75 percent, the lowest level ever.
 
Prediction on Inflation
 Japan's recovery stalled last spring, the report said, while recovery in Western Europe appears unlikely until late this year or early next year.
The monetary fund said there continued to be mixed signals about the strength of the United States recovery. It predicted that American inflation would be 3 percent this year, but slide to 2.8 percent next year.
The report was less optimistic about America's longer-term growth prospects than those of other major industrial nations. The fund said the American economy would grow by 2.4 percent from 1995 to 1998, the lowest among the group of seven nations. In comparison, Japan is expected to grow by 4.5 percent during that period, and Germany by 3.2 percent.
The I.M.F. said it was vital to complete world trade talks, known as the Uruguay Round, because that could spur growth, trade and business confidence while fending off protectionist pressures.
The monetary fund chided most industrial countries for not doing enough to cut their budget deficits, asserting that if those nations had slashed their deficits in recent years, that would have given them far more flexibility to spend more to help pull themselves out of recession.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Tells Of Attrition For Cutbacks

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
Seeking to take the hard edges off his proposal to cut the city government work force by 35,000, Rudolph W. Giuliani told a union representing 17,000 social-service workers last night that he would make those cuts over several years through attrition so he would not "dislocate people."
But stressing one of the foundation points of his campaign, Mr. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor, told members of Local 371 of the Social Service Employees Union that the city government must shrink before private industry will expand. "We can't continue to exist if the only job growth that occurs is in government," he said. 
 His comments came at the end of a day in which police and economic issues dominated the mayoral campaign. Mayor David N. Dinkins announced several proposals to develop the Brooklyn industrial waterfront on a visit yesterday to the borough.
On the visit, the Mayor managed to win the praise of Borough President Howard Golden, who on Tuesday denounced his economic development plans as "too little, too late."
 
A Lukewarm Reception
 Mr. Giuliani's reception before Local 371 was lukewarm at best, with the polite applause at his introduction peppered with boos. At one point while he was fielding questions, a member of the audience loudly accused him of being anti-union.
Unflustered, Mr. Giuliani told the heckler: "I'm a member of a union, my wife is a member of a union, and three-quarters of my family have been members of a union. I have respect for the union movement."
Later Mr. Giuliani said that he, like his wife, Donna Hanover, a former television news reporter, is a member of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. Mr. Giuliani, showing reporters his union card, said he joined the union while he was a commentator on the television program "Inside Edition."
The social-service workers union, which endorsed Mr. Dinkins in 1989, is weighing whether to endorse anyone this year, said the union president, Charles S. Ensley.
 
Dinkins Counterattack
 But despite the union's neutrality, the packed hall of about 400 people gave Mr. Dinkins a standing ovation when he entered minutes after Mr. Giuliani's departure. Attacking Mr. Giuliani's proposals to privatize and trim city government, Mr. Dinkins accused him of a "lifetime of union bashing and labor thrashing."
He also ridiculed Mr. Giuliani's claim that he could cut 35,000 city jobs through attrition while protecting several departments, including the Police and Fire Deparments. "He would have to cut 55 percent of what remains," Mr. Dinkins said. "Arithmetically you can't do it."
The Mayor's focus earlier in the day on the Brooklyn industrial area and a program that he said would create 4,000 jobs in the next four years came as he struggles to bolster his support in a borough he won by fewer than 40,000 votes in 1989.
Mr. Golden, though, did not endorse his fellow Democrat. He is to meet with the Mayor tomorrow.
 
Economic Stimulus
 Mr. Dinkins's proposals were embellishments of a more sweeping economic stimulus plan offered two days ago. Yesterday's proposals included development of a recycling industrial park on the waterfront and expansion of the city's Cocoaport operation at the South Brooklyn Terminal.
Richard Bryers, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani, said: "The Mayor's record with job creation in the private sector is minus 400,000. His credibility on the issue of jobs and the economy is 400,000 less than zero."
The recycling industrial park proposed by the Mayor would be constructed at the very site at which the Mayor had earlier sought to place a controversial sludge treatment plant. But after a torrent of local opposition, the Dinkins administration withdrew that plan earlier this year.
The Dinkins administration would expand the 500,000-square-foot Cocoaport, a major port for imported cocoa, by 250,000 more square feet at a cost of $11 million. Of that, $6 million would come from the state and $5 million from the city's capital budget.
He also proposed leasing land for an intermodal industrial park, enhancing a 40-acre rail area to make it accessible to trucks and barges.
 
Criticism From Police Unions
 As Mr. Dinkins campaigned, the heads of the city's three police unions attacked him on crime, saying that statistics showing a decline in crime are misleading, that he had delayed needed police reform and that his plans to combine the city, transit and housing police were belated.
The union officials made their remarks a day before Mr. Giuliani was to deliver a major address on his own law-enforcement proposals. The officials -- Phil Caruso, who heads the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, and Ron Reale of the transit police union and Timothy Nickels of the housing police union -- stopped short of offering a unified endorsement of Mr. Guiliani.
The criticism came as a new poll, by Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion, found that 43.7 percent of those surveyed favored Mr. Dinkins, compared with 40.3 percent for Mr. Guiliani, but with 766 participants it had a margin of error of 5 percentage points.
During the day, Mr. Giuliani was endorsed by the United Jewish Coalition, a group of 90 rabbis and leaders of New York City Jewish groups.
