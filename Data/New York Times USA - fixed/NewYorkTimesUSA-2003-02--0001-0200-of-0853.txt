HEADLINE: The Qaeda Vipers In Europe's Bosom 

BYLINE:  By Jonathan Stevenson; Jonathan Stevenson is senior fellow for counterterrorism at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Make no mistake: the United States is still Al Qaeda's main enemy. But it's become morbidly obvious in the last few months, with terrorist attacks in Indonesia and Kenya, that Al Qaeda has expanded its "fields of jihad." That development should be a particular cause of concern for Europe, where much of the planning of the Sept. 11 attacks was done and where perhaps thousands of Al Qaeda affiliates live. Just this week, the Italian police arrested 28 Pakistanis suspected of links to Al Qaeda. 
 It is no surprise that the 15 million Muslims in the European Union should be ripe for recruitment by Al Qaeda. They live on the margins of European society, socially, economically and politically. More than 100 British Muslims joined the Taliban in Afghanistan to try to repel American and allied forces, and up to 3,000 British Muslims have undergone military training at terrorist camps in Afghanistan since 1996. Radical clerics preach war against the West in Europe's mosques. European citizens like Richard C. Reid of Britain, who just received a life sentence for trying to ignite a bomb in his shoes on a trans-Atlantic flight, and Zacarias Moussaoui of France, described by prosecutors as the would-be 20th hijacker in the Sept. 11 attacks, were converts to militant Islam. 
 For the sake of the United States, Europe needs to tackle the root causes that make young Muslims resort to terrorism. But it needs to act to protect itself as well. So far, there have been no Al Qaeda attacks carried out in Europe, but officials say they have thwarted several plots. Over the last six weeks, the police in France, Spain and Britain, as well as Italy, have arrested more than 50 terrorism suspects, some in possession of the deadly poison ricin, disrupting what was apparently a Qaeda network. 
The obvious first steps are tightened border security and a Europe-wide immigration policy that would allow for better monitoring of who is applying for visas where, and expanded intelligence and law-enforcement links. But in the long term they won't be enough. Europe also needs to resolve the economic and political problems that could make Al Qaeda attractive to a young Muslim. The tough question is how to do it.
Aggressive anti-discrimination policies in employment and education may help. The most rigorous fair employment laws in Europe, verging on affirmative action, are in effect in Northern Ireland. Workers there are entitled to damages even if they have been only indirectly and unintentionally discriminated against. Such provisions have probably kept young Catholics from joining the Irish Republican Army. 
More focused government subsidies for Muslim schools that follow a moderate form of Islam would also be salutary. Britain has begun limited subsidies to Muslim schools, but has made no effort to encourage moderate Islam education as opposed to fundamentalism, whose support by wealthy Wahhabi Muslims gives it an advantage. Another possible remedy could be government benefits for businesses operated by Muslims. Such economic and education policies would be conducive to participation in politics, in which Muslims are seriously underrepresented. 
More broadly, European nations like Britain need to end reflexive multiculturalism -- for example, lax language and cultural education requirements for naturalization -- that perversely discourages Muslims from learning the ways of their new countries, thus isolating them from the mainstream and fueling radicalization. Stricter requirements for citizenship may also dissolve racial or religious biases among majority populations. 
In theory, France, which wants its five million Muslims to think of themselves as Frenchmen, provides a good model. It encourages a secular view of French citizenship by promoting a strict separation of church and state. It requires candidates for naturalization to speak serviceable French and know basic French history and culture. Though criticized by some orthodox French Muslims, the new government-endorsed Council for the Muslim Religion should help secure a position for Muslims in the civic mainstream and produce an indigenous, moderate version of Islam. 
Politically, the European Union could soften Muslims' views of the West by moving ahead on Turkey's bid to join the union -- for instance, by setting a definite date for talks on membership. That would send the message that secular Muslim countries are considered partners of Western nations. Further, the union could emphasize the economic links between Europe and the Persian Gulf nations and its financial support for the Palestinian Authority. It should also revitalize the 27-member European-Mediterranean Partnership, which was established in 1995 with high hopes of deepening ties among the countries of the Mediterranean but became enervated because of the second Palestinian intifada and Sept. 11. 
Al Qaeda has proven a resilient, pragmatic and elusive network of networks. It may take a generation to eradicate all its branches. But if the causes of radical Islam are not eradicated also, another network will rise to take Al Qaeda's place. Europe has the ideals, institutions and resources to change the attitudes of its radical Muslim population. What it does could be a model for the rest of the world.

HEADLINE: Japan Posts Gloomy Numbers, And Fears of Recession Return 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Japan's jobless rate matched a record high in December, one of several indicators that show that the economy stalled in the last quarter of 2002.
 The gloomy figures, which include declines in consumer spending, new-home starts and production, suggest that Japan may be nearing its fourth recession in the last decade. They also come just after the government passed an extra budget worth $25 billion. The package, which includes expanded payments for the newly unemployed, will only offset a more severe slowdown, not bolster the slowing economy, analysts said. 
 Hemmed in by a bulging budget deficit, policy makers are stepping up calls on the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy further. But anything less than a drastic turnaround in current policy will not jump-start growth because of the government's plan to push banks to write off their bad loans, a strategy that will most likely lead to more bankruptcies and unemployment.
Emerging signs of a slowdown in the United States, deepening deflation at home and jitters over the possibility of war in Iraq have helped push the benchmark Nikkei 225-stock index to near two-decade lows. Government bond yields have also fallen to record lows, leading some to speculate a bubble has formed in the credit market.
The government has played down the risks to the economy. Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa said the economy was "not very bad." Yet Mr. Shiokawa, alarmed that the yen's recent strength could sap Japanese exports, warned that his ministry was prepared to buy dollars.
Shipments of automobiles, computer chips and machinery to other parts of Asia and the United States have been one of the few drivers of Japan's $4.4 trillion economy. Growth in exports, however, has moderated in recent months.
The unemployment rate matched a record 5.5 percent in December. Spending by wage earners declined 3.5 percent in December, the third consecutive decline. New-home starts also fell 3.4 percent.
Consumer prices, too, continued their slide. Prices in Tokyo fell 0.4 percent this month, compared with those in the month a year earlier.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Dow Is Up for Day but Is Down for 3rd Consecutive Week

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Investors took chances on blue-chip stocks yesterday, picking up bargains after the decline of nearly 900 points in the Dow Jones industrial average in the last two weeks. But the buying was not enough to save Wall Street from its third consecutive weekly decline, a slide not seen in nearly four months, or from heavy losses for the month.
 Analysts attributed the day's gains to investors' seeking lower-priced stocks rather than improving sentiment about the market or the economy, especially since the news on both fronts was mixed yesterday. The blue-chip advance came despite investors' continued concerns that a war with Iraq would derail what has already been feeble economic progress. 
 "Is there anything that has significantly changed that justifies or is driving this rally?" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation. "And my answer to that question is no."
The Dow closed up 108.68 points, or 1.4 percent, to 8,053.81. For the week, the Dow lost 1 percent.
The broader market was mixed, with technology issues slipping on signs of further weakness in the chip sector. The Nasdaq composite index fell 1.44 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,320.91. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 11.09 points, or 1.3 percent, to 855.70. For the week, the Nasdaq fell 1.6 percent and the S.& P. lost 0.7 percent.
All three gauges endured declines in 8 of the previous 11 sessions. Over that period, the Dow plummeted 897.49 points. And, despite the surge yesterday, the indexes posted their third consecutive weekly losses; that has not happenedin almost four months, or since the period that ended Oct. 4.
Likewise, it was a bad month for Wall Street. In January, the Dow fell 3.5 percent, the Nasdaq declined 1.1 percent and the S.& P. lost 2.7 percent.
Analysts were dubious that any buying would be long-lasting. Investors have been refusing to commit themselves to stocks before knowing whether there will be war with Iraq.
While the market typically begins to lift after military action is undertaken, and more so if it is successful, analysts warn investors not to count on that happening this time given the already dismal state of earnings and the economy.
"What happens if we go to war, win the war and the market keeps going down?" said Gary Kaltbaum, market technician for Investors' Edge Partners in Orlando, Fla. "I just think valuations are too high and earnings are still pretty bad."
Honeywell rose 94 cents, to $24.44, after meeting fourth-quarter earnings expectations and forecasting 2003 profit in line with expectations.
Disney advanced $1.15, to $17.50, on fiscal first-quarter profits that were 2 cents a share higher than Wall Street's estimate.
But the technology sector was pulled lower by the chip equipment maker Applied Materials, which said first-quarter orders would decline 35 percent, rather than the 20 percent previously projected. Applied Materials fell 98 cents, to $11.97.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners 5 to 2 on the New York Stock Exchange, where trading was light.
Bond prices mostly rose. The price of a 10-year note increased 1/32, to 100 0/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dropped to 3.96 percent from 3.97 percent on Thursday. The two-year note fell slightly, to 99 27/32. Its yield rose to 1.69 percent from 1.68 percent.
The 30-year bond climbed 7/32, to 108 5/32. Its yield dropped to 4.84 percent from 4.86 percent.

HEADLINE: Russia Revokes Licenses for All Importsof Meat and Poultry 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
The Agriculture Ministry revoked all import licenses for meat and poultry today without warning or explanation.
 The decision will effectively halt all shipments of meat and poultry from abroad starting next week, Russian news agencies reported. Importers will have to reapply for the permits, known as veterinary licenses -- a process that could take weeks, given Russia's tangled bureaucracy. 
 While it did not say so today, the government has clearly been moving to protect the domestic meat industry. The agriculture minister, Alexei Gordeyev, said on Wednesday that beginning in May the government would begin imposing quotas on meat imports, resulting in a reduction of about one-third in total imports. The quotas are the first Russia has imposed on foreign meat, an agricultural specialist at a Western embassy in Moscow said today.
As Russian industries mature, they, like those in more developed countries, have begun to demand that their government erect trade barriers to shield them from foreign competition. The government agreed last year to impose high tariffs on used foreign cars, the main rivals of new Russian-made cars.
Russia had been importing about two-fifths of the meat it consumes. In comments today, Mr. Gordeyev said Russia should eventually stop importing meat altogether. "Western companies want to gain ground on the Russian market, and we should take steps to curb these aspirations," he told the Prime-Tass news agency.
But economists said that Russian producers were not likely to make efficient use of the new breathing space granted them by the interruption of imports and the likely rise in prices to follow.
"We consumers will lose more than Russian meat producers will win," said Sergei Guriyev, vice rector of the New Economics School in Moscow. "The national interest is actually in open trade."
The situation today was reminiscent of a trade dispute last year between American poultry producers and the Agriculture Ministry. Citing health concerns, the ministry revoked veterinary certificates for American chicken last year. But the action was seen as retaliation for tariffs the United States had imposed on imported steel from Russia and elsewhere. 
American poultry producers eventually regained access to Russia, their biggest export market, but not without loss.
The meat licenses revoked today are also expected to be regranted eventually. But the use of import quotas and license revocations to shield domestic meat producers is likely to become an issue in Russia's already stalled negotiations to enter the World Trade Organization, Mr. Guriyev said.

Mexican Energy Giant Lumbers Into Hazy Future

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
The view from the 44th-floor offices of Raul Munoz Leos is both breathtaking and dismal. All the city lies beneath him, steeped in an ocean of smog.
 It is as good an image as any for the sea of troubles he faced two years ago when he became director of Petroleos Mexicanos, the state-owned energy company. 
 Pemex, as it is known, controls Mexico's production of oil, natural gas and petrochemicals. It employs more than 130,000 people, and ships as much oil to the United States as Saudi Arabia does. Nearly all of its net income goes to the national treasury, financing roughly 40 percent of Mexico's federal budget. 
Mr. Munoz Leos is driving the company to ever greater production of crude oil, and he estimates that output will grow to 4 million barrels a day in 2006 from 3.2 million in 2002. But the long-term outlook for Pemex is as murky as the view from his office window. Independent analysts predict that after 2010, production will level off and then start falling steeply. 
For Pemex is a giant bound and lashed by politics -- including a tradition that prohibits any direct foreign investment in oil or gas that is still in the ground. Those restraints were created and to a great degree are still controlled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as PRI -- the old guard that ran Mexico continuously from 1929 to 2000.
"You turn the battleship's wheel many times to turn the ship one degree," Mr. Munoz Leos said in an interview. "We are working on a culture change. The focus of our change is to help Pemex be able to compete with the world leaders in the oil business."
Even so, he said, "we have a significant number of rules and regulations from many government agencies that create very heavy bureaucratic problems in almost everything we attempt."
Chief among these is the ban on foreign investment, imposed when the government created Pemex by nationalizing American and British oil interests in 1938.
Mr. Munoz Leos managed to persuade Mexico's Congress to let him have an extra $4 billion this year to invest in expanding production, but no one thinks Mexico can adequately finance its growing energy needs on its own. Today, even though it is sitting on some of the world's major fossil fuel reserves, the country must import one-quarter of its gasoline and one-fifth of its natural gas from the United States because it does not have enough refineries or drilling rigs to meet its own needs.
"It is us, the Mexicans, who have stunted the growth of Mexico's oil industry," Mr. Munoz Leos said this week in a speech to workers and engineers at a Pemex refinery.
Mr. Munoz Leos, 62, came to Pemex after a long tenure as chief executive of DuPont Mexico, and by all accounts his managerial skills are great. Though Pemex still loses at least $1 billion a year to internal corruption, his administration has managed to end the use of Pemex as a piggy bank for politicians. And he has formed a new engineering group inside Pemex, reconstituting expertise that was eliminated a decade ago by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
In an effort to reduce the government's role in the economy as the advent of the North American Free Trade Agreement loomed, Mr. Salinas divided Pemex into four subsidiaries -- refining, exploration and production, natural gas and petrochemicals. The reorganization, seen as a step toward selling one or more of those businesses, instead created "a very significant weakness" in the company, Mr. Munoz Leos said.
Privatization remains the great bugaboo surrounding Pemex. 
Mr. Munoz Leos faces a major challenge in February, when he plans to begin offering a group of contracts, potentially worth billions of dollars, for work that would help Pemex tap natural gas in the giant Burgos basin in northeastern Mexico, near the Texas border. 
He says that by bringing in private capital and technology that Mexico lacks, the contracts, called multiple service contracts, will help Pemex develop the Burgos field and deliver one billion cubic feet of gas a day by 2005. Mexico has 64 trillion cubic feet of proven gas reserves, or about a 50-year supply at present rates of domestic consumption, but it has been able to expand output only slowly, while demand for gas, especially to fire power plants, is growing rapidly.
The PRI, which lost the presidency to Vicente Fox in 2000 but is still the largest party in Congress, is fiercely opposed to granting the contracts, saying they violate the Constitution. 
Mexico opened the storage, distribution and transportation of natural gas to private investment in 1995, and private companies are allowed to export and import natural gas. But the contracts that Mr. Munoz Leos says are crucial to Mexico's future are seen by the PRI as a form of political treason.
Another political battle looms. Mr. Munoz Leos's predecessor, Rogelio Montemayor, and the leader of Pemex's unionized workers, Carlos Romero Deschamps, are both prominent Institutional Revolutionary Party stalwarts, and they are trying to fend off a criminal investigation that cuts to the heart of the history of corruption at Pemex. 
The Fox government has said the two men helped funnel tens of millions of dollars from Pemex into the PRI before the elections in 2000. Mr. Montemayor, a former state governor, left Mexico for the United States, where he is fighting extradition in a Houston courtroom. Mr. Romero Deschamps, who holds a seat in the Senate, is battling attempts in Congress to strip him of the immunity the seat gives him. Unless they win their cases, it seems unlikely that the PRI will lift a finger to help Mr. Munoz Leos overhaul Pemex. 
George Baker, an independent oil analyst in Houston who publishes a newsletter, Mexico Energy Intelligence, compares Mr. Munoz Leos's challenges to the myth of Sisyphus.
"Here's a man who comes in from the private sector, from DuPont, which meets international standards as a business, and he faces political problems that would never apply in a business context," Mr. Baker said. 
"The politics of Pemex go far beyond what should be expected of a manager of a business," he said. "Munoz Leos has had to say, 'Let's work within the realm of the possible.' With the multiple service contracts, he's flying into tremendous opposition to try to find a way to ask a basic question: Does the Mexican state have to be the risk-taker and the financier? Or can private management skills and technology be brought in?
"It's a remarkable accomplishment to even take that position, regardless of how the multiple service contracts come out. The future of Mexico is much easier to understand than the present, and at least Munoz Leos understands the future."

Pitching In As Town Hits Hard Times

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: JONESVILLE, Ind., Jan. 30 

 BODY:
This town of 236 souls is stone-broke. Founded about 1865, Jonesville now has $359 in the bank. It owes the trash company $5,966.25.
 So Rick Trimpe, who has spent 21 of his 40 years as a volunteer firefighter -- 12 as chief -- and last year also became president of the Town Council, is adding a new hat to his collection: garbage man. 
 "If you call me," Mr. Trimpe assured angry residents complaining about the town's abrupt cancellation of curbside trash pickup, "I'll come and get it and take it to the Dumpster." 
Jonesville, a four-block stretch off Interstate 65 halfway between Indianapolis and Louisville, Ky., is an extreme example of the struggle facing hundreds of other American cities and towns whose revenues have shrunk in the lingering sluggish economy. 
Nobody seems to have stolen anything here. No catastrophe brought the town to the brink of bankruptcy. Instead, a combination of exuberant spending during the flush years of 2000 and 2001, and a surprise shortfall in tax payments from the state and county last year -- plus plain poor planning -- has landed Jonesville in this deep hole.
Now residents who have known one another all their lives but cannot remember ever voting in a municipal election are left wrestling with what exactly it means to be a town, testing democracy in its raw form.
Melissa Schultheis, the clerk-treasurer -- who, like the three members of the Town Council, gave up her monthly stipend long ago -- has agreed to advance the $194 monthly Dumpster fee from her pocket. Mr. Trimpe, whose day job is in weights and measures in surrounding Bartholomew County, promised to photocopy the town ordinances so everyone could have a copy. 
At an emergency town meeting on Wednesday evening, housewives offered to cook supper or wash cars for fund-raisers. One even suggested raising taxes. Men in overalls with grease on their palms promised to attend future council meetings, if board members promised to listen. 
"Work with us," pleaded Mike Mensendiek, 35, an auctioneer and real estate broker who joined the Town Council last January. "Help us get back on our feet. It's a bad situation, but if we all stick together, we're going to be fine."
Mr. Mensendiek should not count on Joe Sutton, who lives with his wife and four children in the brown trailer adjacent to where the town placed two Dumpsters when it stopped curbside pickup on Jan. 15. Mr. Sutton, who works at a nearby factory, is circulating a petition to disband the town and have it re-annexed by the county, and he is threatening to sue the Council for encroaching on his land.
"They just throw it on top of the Dumpster," he said of the new trash situation. "It ends up on my yard. This is going to draw cockroaches, rats and everything else into my home."
Of the town fathers, he said: "They want to do what they want. They don't want to listen to the people."
From the outside, Jonesville is not much of a town at all. It has two churches, a post office, a mill and a tool and dye shop, where Mr. Mensendiek, the councilman, works. A century-old tavern called The Brick draws people from miles around for its $2.50 burgers (add 25 cents for cheese) and $2 chili or chowder.
There is no town hall; Ms. Schultheis does the books at her dining room table. She does not have a fax machine. Minutes from a century of town meetings, the earliest ones all in German, are locked in an old safe at the firehouse along with electric bonds and the handwritten vote tally from the council elections in 1947.
Yet in a two-year period of seeming surpluses, the town managed to spend $187,035 -- $27,500 on a tornado siren, $41,000 to trim and remove trees, $7,500 to knock down a dead man's house, $24,639 for lawyers' fees, $5,950 for a new police car, $5,500 for a tractor, $1,900 on uniforms for the town marshal and $12,000 for a shed and dog pens, among other items. 
Some of those purchases were apparently approved by previous council members outside of public hearings. Ms. Schultheis said she learned about the patrol car when the dealership called to ask how to fill out the title. And few even remember the hot dog and chips celebration the old board called an appreciation dinner and billed at $2,500.
"They were trying to do everything for the best of the town," Mr. Mensendiek sighed. "They just got ahead of themselves."
Though no more than a handful of residents have turned up for the monthly town meetings in the back of the firehouse in years, the two dozen folding chairs filled early for Wednesday's special session. There was no written agenda, no Pledge of Allegiance or invocation, no microphones. Mr. Trimpe opened the meeting with a simple request: "No yelling and stuff like that," he said. "That goes for the board members, too."
Mr. Mensendiek read through the list of expenditures, to gasps and head-shaking -- $41,000 for trees? Why didn't anyone watch the dwindling resources?
"Really and truly, I make a budget every year," scolded Becky Davis, who has lived here since 1972. "I know what I'm going to get, and I know what I'm going to spend. Maybe I didn't have as much money as you people have, but I know where every penny of it went."
Much of the ire was directed at the former board members, Arnold Madden and Earl Chasteen, who did not show up. In an interview later, Mr. Madden, 48, insisted that "we did nothing, absolutely nothing, wrong." Mr. Chasteen did not return telephone calls.
"I don't know how much we spent," Mr. Madden admitted. "That should be what the treasurer's for, to tell us what we've got."
Matt McLean, who joined the board in April 2001, acknowledged that buying the police car was a mistake, since the county would have donated one. "We screwed that up," he said.
But the Council never anticipated a drop in state revenue from as much as $1,500 a month to less than $800 a month for most of last year, and $693.71 this January. And a change in software used by the county, Ms. Schultheis said, resulted in Jonesville receiving just part of what was due in December, with no clear indication of when the rest will come.
"That's just like the Senate and Congress," said Mrs. Davis's husband, Terrell. "They spend the money and then here comes the new bunch and say they have nothing to do with it."
"My daddy told me a long time ago," he added, "if our foresight was as good as our hindsight, we'd be worth a damn sight."
The 25 residents, more than 10 percent of the whole town, arrived on Wednesday steamed over the abrupt cancellation of curbside pickup, which cost $675 a month.
As long as they were there, residents also complained about stray dogs barking all night, and weeds growing by the railroad tracks, and cars speeding on side streets. They questioned the need for a town marshal when they do not even know his phone number (the position is required by the state) and wondered why public notices are hung in the post office rather than distributed to each of the 76 households (the last such mailing cost $238).
The proposal to un-incorporate was roundly booed. Being part of the county would mean higher water bills, and more red tape, residents said.
Slowly, the talk turned to recovery. Don Smith suggested that each family pitch in $2 so Ms. Schultheis would not have to cover the Dumpster fee herself. Mr. Smith's wife, Dee, volunteered their teenagers as couriers for the garbage of the elderly and disabled. Ron Penroso offered $2,000 for the barely used tractor, and said he would mow the grass by the tracks, too.
Mr. Trimpe said he would notify the post office that its monthly rent on the town-owned land where it parks its trailer, which has been stuck at $10 for a generation, would jump to $100. Ms. Schultheis reminded people that every dog must be registered -- $3 a pop for the town coffers.
"Do we get any actual tags?" came a question from the audience.
Ms. Schultheis looked sheepish, and acknowledged that there were "a whole bunch in a box somewhere" but she had no idea what had happened to them.
"Can we get more?" a woman asked.
"When we get some money," Mr. Trimpe said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Incomes And Spending Both Gained In December 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Americans made and spent more money in December, reports released today showed, helping the economy cling to a fifth consecutive quarter of growth. Midwest manufacturing expanded in January, the latest sign that demand may be picking up.
 The 0.9 percent gain in personal spending in December was the biggest in five months, powered by a surge in auto sales, the Commerce Department said. The 0.4 percent gain in income, to $9.11 trillion, was the best since June. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago's factory index rose to 56, the highest figure since May, from 51.7 in December. Readings higher than 50 indicate expansion at the region's factories. 
 "Most households are maintaining spending, and that is supporting all areas of the economy," said William Sullivan, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley. "Any revival in manufacturing would be a prelude to more consistent gains in capital spending, and that is the missing ingredient for a more robust recovery."
Consumer confidence dropped to a three-month low in January as Americans grew more pessimistic about the months ahead. The University of Michigan's sentiment index fell to 82.4 from a revised 86.7 in December. The measure reached a nine-year low of 80.6 in October.
"We're seeing worries about the possible impact of a war with Iraq creeping into consumers' psyches," said Stephen Stanley, an economist at RBS Greenwich Capital. "Given that geopolitical worries rather than traditional economic issues may dominate attitude measures over the next few months, it would be wise to take the confidence survey results with a grain of salt and pay attention mainly to the actual spending data."
Spending rose 4.5 percent for all of 2002, matching the increase in 2001. Incomes increased 3 percent last year, the smallest gain since 1954. The figures are reported in current dollars and are not adjusted for inflation.
Disposable income, or money left over after taxes, increased 5.9 percent last year. That compared with 3.8 percent in 2001 and underscored how tax cuts put more money into people's pockets.
Economists had expected personal spending to rise 0.7 percent in December after a previously reported 0.5 percent gain in November. Sales of cars and other durable goods surged last month as no-interest loans lured buyers to dealer lots. December spending was the highest since a 1.1 percent gain in July, suggesting consumer spending strengthened entering the first quarter.

HEADLINE: AK Steel Posts Wider Quarterly Loss; 
<DTL >MIDDLETOWN, Ohio, Jan. 31

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
After raising its bid for the bankrupt National Steel Corporation, the AK Steel Corporation reported a wider loss in the fourth quarter today because of pension and retiree benefit losses. 
 AK Steel said that it lost $489.7 million, or $4.54 a share, in the October-December quarter, compared with a loss of $76.4 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. 
 Excluding charges, the company would have earned $600,000, or 1 cent a share. That is 4 cents below expectations of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. 
Sales for the quarter were $1.06 billion, up from $932.7 million a year earlier. 
AK Steel said that it took a charge of $483.8 million after taxes because of losses from the pension and retiree benefit plans, resulting fromincreasing health care costs, lower interest rates and losses in equity markets. AK Steel said that it had expected the expense. 
The company also had an after-tax expense of $6.5 million, or 6 cents a share, for an investment in a taconite iron ore mining and processing plant in Minnesota. AK Steel said the plant had lost big customers including AK Steel, which had decided to buy most of its iron ore from other suppliers. 
AK Steel, which is based in Middletown, has emerged as the lead bidder in a competition with the U.S. Steel Corporation of Pittsburgh, to buy National Steel. The case is pending in Bankruptcy Court in Chicago.

UAL Has Big Quarterly Loss And Ends Year Deep in Red
UAL, parent of United Airlines, reported a much larger fourth-quarter loss that underscored the problems that forced it to seek bankruptcy protection in December.
 The company's fourth-quarter loss was $1.47 billion, nearly five times its loss of $308 million in the fourth quarter of 2001, when the airline was still struggling to recover from the Sept. 11 attacks. For the year, UAL reported a net loss of $3.2 billion, compared with $2.1 billion in 2001. Page C2.

HEADLINE: Corporate Turnaround Paved the Way for Profit 

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN and JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Only a decade ago, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield would have been an unlikely honey pot for any state government to use to solve a cash crisis.
 Empire's management and board of directors were pilloried in the press and in Congress for running their business into the ground while they were enjoying lavish perquisites, from silver punch bowls to chauffeured limousines and cashmere throws. The company's imperious chief executive, Albert A. Cardone, was ousted in 1993, and the chief financial officer, Jerry Weissman, went to prison for misleading Congress about the company's health. 
 Help arrived in May 1993, when the board brought in Ira Millstein, a corporate management expert, to help lead the reforms. In late 1994, Dr. Michael A. Stocker, a family practitioner who had been at Cigna, signed on as Empire's new chief executive. 
To improve performance, he simplified everywhere he could. He streamlined the number of products Empire sold from dozens to four, so customer representatives could better field calls, and as some customers left, he shrank the work force to 6,000, from 7,500.
He shifted the product mix away from Empire's traditional indemnity products to managed care to keep pace with rivals, and speeded up claims handling so hospitals that filed electronically got their money in 14 days. When bills needed to be contested, Empire adopted a "pay and pursue" policy, meaning it pays now and argues later.
The company's turnaround has been remarkable. Underwriting profits have surged 16 straight quarters, complaints have fallen and the company's Standard & Poor's rating has risen sharply. Even in 2001, the year that the company lost employees and its headquarters in the World Trade Center, it was back processing claims the day the towers collapsed and finished the year with $131 million in overall profits.
In 1996, Empire also took the approach that it "didn't want to be special," as Dr. Stocker put it. So it relinquished its long-held status as New York's insurer of last resort and forfeited the discount it had enjoyed on hospital rates. Today, all managed care providers in New York must extend benefits to individual buyers, come one, come all.
Dr. Stocker has done well personally. Even without access to stock options, he took home $2.1 million in 2001. Two other senior executives each made more than $1 million. "We compensate well," Dr. Stocker said unapologetically.
Nonetheless, he avoids anything resembling the perks that got earlier management in trouble. There is the occasional car service and a mini-bar stocked with Diet Cokes. But he paid for the paintings in his office and his computer at home, according to a company spokeswoman. He also has no gripes about having to wait a year from the offering date before insiders qualify for stock options.
Empire has done even better in his care. Standard & Poor's has nudged the company's financial strength rating up seven notches from the B-plus it had in 1997 to the current A-minus.
"They have done an excellent job turning the company around," said Philip Tsang, the analyst who follows the company at Standard & Poor's. "We were quite impressed, when two days after the loss of the World Trade Center, I got onto their Web site, and they were back in business."
Dr. Stocker has also been the driving force behind the decision to join the for-profit ranks. Companies like Aetna and Cigna that have access to the capital markets, he argued, can more easily invest in their businesses and achieve economies of scale through mergers. "Scale is really important in this business," Dr. Stocker said.
Empire's crowning moment came in November, when the company traded in its nonprofit status for a new identity as a publicly traded company called WellChoice. Despite the weak market for initial public offerings, Empire was valued at $2 billion, twice the net worth on its books.
The company's unexpected value has turned out to be a boon for state lawmakers seeking to close a giant budget gap. But whether the public lost something in the conversion remains to be seen. Some health care executives, like Howard J. Berman, the president of Excellus Inc., a large nonprofit insurer in upstate New York, make the case that the market's few remaining nonprofit insurers should be preserved.
"Who's worrying about the community? I'm sitting here and saying my priority is my community," he said. "I'm validated by how I serve this market," he added, "not by how I serve the capital markets or a group of absentee stockholders."

HEADLINE: Pentagon and Companies In Agreement on Spectrum 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER 8. LEE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Technology companies and the Pentagon have reached an agreement to unlock a swath of spectrum for the next generation of wireless devices, officials said today.
 The companies said this would lift the popularity of high-speed wireless Internet service, a bright spot in an otherwise moribund industry. 
 For the military, the agreement wards off an emerging threat to their radar systems by setting detailed technical mechanisms to deal with interference. 
"The Pentagon was very concerned that wireless devices were popping up in what has historically been a radar band," said Steven Price, deputy assistant secretary of defense for spectrum and command, control and communications policy.
Spectrum has become a battleground the last few years among the competing interests of consumers, the technology industry, the military and other government agencies.
Michael K. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has advocated change, citing the need to open more unlicensed spectrum.
Spectrum is the technology industry's most valuable -- though invisible -- real estate. It is measured by its frequency, usually in units of kilohertz, megahertz or gigahertz. The most desirable property is below 3 gigahertz because that is a range where portable devices can generally emit and receive signals economically. As technology advances, however, consumer devices can take advantage of higher frequencies.
The new agreement will give technology companies access to 255 megahertz of unlicensed spectrum around the 5-gigahertz band, a large amount of band close to premium spectrum that can be described as "a block or two off the beach."
There is currently about 200 megahertz of spectrum for outdoor use under the 3-gigahertz range, but it is cluttered with items like garage door openers, baby monitors and cordless phones.
The 5-gigahertz range opens a new arena for the industry's next generation of wireless technology, including 802.11a, one of the so-called Wi-Fi standards that is many times faster than the popular 802.11b used in coffee shops, offices and parks across the country for Internet connections.
"This is undeveloped property," said Scott Blake Harris, a lawyer who represented large technology concerns in the negotiations. "The 5-gigahertz band is so much less developed, so much cleaner."
While this agreement represents a policy position, it is completely balanced on technological compromise. Military and industry engineers worked around the clock for the last several weeks to determine specifications that could both adequately protect the military's radar without being overly sensitive. Under the agreement, the wireless devices and radar will share the spectrum but the devices will be designed to jump to another frequency when they sense radar operating in their range.
The time pressure was exerted by an approaching World Radio Conference, a biennial meeting under the aegis of the United Nations at which international spectrum allocations are ironed out. 
While the conference does not take place until June, the United States needs several months to lobby other nations to share its position. Despite the worldwide influence of both the United States military and technology companies, each nation has a single vote at the conference.
"It would have been a much more difficult scenario for the U.S. position without a unified delegation," Mr. Price said.

HEADLINE: Meat Safety at Risk 

 BODY:
A court ruling last week in Nebraska has dealt a devastating blow to the nation's program for policing meat safety. It calls into question the government's authority to shut down meat plants for repeatedly violating sanitary standards designed to combat bacterial contamination and outbreaks of food-borne illness.
 Judge Joseph Bataillon of the Federal District Court rebuffed an Agriculture Department effort to shut down the operations of Nebraska Beef, an Omaha slaughterhouse with numerous citations for violating standard sanitary operating procedures. The plant was chosen for special scrutiny after the discovery last year of deadly E. coli bacteria in ground beef produced by a Nebraska Beef customer. In granting a temporary restraining ordering blocking the closure, the judge elevated the economic interests of a local employer over public health while questioning the government's power to act under current law. 
 All this has a familiar ring. Just two years ago, in a different case, a federal appeals court in New Orleans declared that the Agriculture Department lacked the power to close a Dallas beef processing plant that had failed three rounds of tests for Salmonella contamination in a year. Unfortunately, Congress and the Bush administration failed to heed the message of that misguided decision by passing a law that reaffirms the government's authority to enforce health standards.
Reacting to the new ruling, the Agriculture Department has decided to reach a settlement with the meat packer that allows the plant to continue to operate. It is hard to fault the department's lawyers for wanting to avoid a drawn-out court fight likely to result in an adverse final decision by the judge. But even now, Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman refuses to acknowledge the grievous damage inflicted on her department's food safety efforts by the courts' suggestion that the government has no authority to close a plant based on public health considerations. She still hesitates to get behind legislation sponsored by Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Richard Durbin of Illinois, Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and others that would close this and other gaping holes in the nation's food safety system. That is inexcusable.
To her credit, Ms. Veneman has said she will seek $42 million more in funding next year for increased microbial testing of meat and poultry and other needed food safety initiatives. But more money and good intentions are no substitute for strong legislative action clarifying the government's power to enforce stringent safety standards.

HEADLINE: Beliefs; 
'Pacem in Terris,' and debate on it, echo anew.

BYLINE:  By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
The 40th anniversary of Pope John XXIII's encyclical "Pacem in Terris" ("Peace on Earth") is not until April, but the commemoration has already begun -- understandably enough.
 Pope John Paul II made it the subject of his World Day of Peace Message on Jan. 1 and of a message to journalists on Jan. 24. 
 "Pacem in Terris" reflected another moment of great international tension. John XXIII conceived of writing it in October 1962 -- in the midst of the Cuban missile crisis -- during the late-night hours when he passed back and forth from his writing desk to his private chapel, composing a message sent to Kennedy and Khrushchev in hopes of bringing them into agreement and preventing a war that might incinerate millions in its opening salvos. 
When the encyclical emerged just before Easter in 1963, it was addressed not only to the Catholic bishops, clergy and faithful, as was customary, but also "to all men of good will." And "Pacem in Terris" was embraced by non-Catholic readers like no previous encyclical.
One reason was its refusal to be constricted by the stalemate of superpowers and the balance of nuclear terror that then defined peace. Pope John XXIII, in a phrase not then current, was thinking "outside the box."
His thinking focused on two topics. One was a lengthy catalog of human rights, including economic rights, that he said all people and nations had a duty to respect. The other was a call for some new kind of world authority adequately empowered to address what he called the "universal common good."
In the view of John Paul II, the encyclical grasped the nascent human rights movements' "singular power to change history," a power ultimately triumphant in Central and Eastern Europe. "The road to peace," as the present pope summarizes the encyclical's teaching, "lay in the defense and promotion of basic human rights." 
But are there not "situations in which nothing short of war can defend or establish" such rights? That was one objection raised in 1965 by the theologian Paul Tillich at a major conference where a score of world leaders addressed the themes of "Pacem in Terris."
A refugee from Nazism, Tillich welcomed the encyclical but countered its optimism with a more tragic perspective. Other theologians, like Reinhold Niebuhr and even John Courtney Murray, a Catholic, also questioned the pope's optimism. Couldn't the ingredients in his recipe for peace -- human rights, disarmament, equal respect for all nations, economic development, the peaceful resolution of differences by dialogue and negotiation -- come into conflict with one another? Wouldn't hard choices be unavoidable?
The drama now being played out on the world stage necessarily draws attention to John XXIII's plea for the evolution of a universal public authority commensurate to the problem of menacing armaments and the promotion of that "universal common good."
His brief, abstract argument for such an authority was made tangible in the hope he placed in the United Nations and its Universal Declaration of Human Rights as first steps in that evolution.
Clearly the United Nations' capacity -- actual and potential -- to serve as that public authority is one of the things at the center of the Iraq drama. Yet when one reads John XXIII's description of that "public authority, having worldwide power and endowed with the proper means for the efficacious pursuit of its objective," one recognizes that today there is another claimant to the role: the United States.
This claim may be unacknowledged. It emerges less from words than from the logic of the war on terror and the promulgation of military doctrines many see as little short of global police powers. But the half-explicit, half-implicit claim of the United States to global authority has also been at the center of the recent drama. What has galvanized opinion in other parts of the world, however painful or unfair it may seem to Americans, is not just the potential threat of Iraq but also the potential threat of the United States.
John XXIII saw such a problem 40 years ago when he warned that the world authority he envisaged "must be set up by common accord, and not imposed by force" or assumed on the basis of military or economic superiority. Effective global power had to be exercised with "sincere and real impartiality" rather than as "an instrument of one-sided interests." Indeed, even if a supranational authority did act impartially, it would still, he wrote, have "to avoid all suspicion of partiality."
Underlying "Pacem in Terris" was another conviction pertinent to the current drama: Peacemaking was a gestalt -- a total configuration of endeavors that encompassed disarmament, human rights, economic development, sensitivity to the dignity of weaker nations and, John XXIII would doubtless add today, environmental protection and the campaigns against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. 
It may have been a weakness that the pope did not rank in importance these multiple aspects of peacemaking, or address the problem of resolving conflicts among them. But in insisting that they all went together, he was presaging much of the current conflict.
Religious leaders, no less than political ones, have raised this or that objection to a war in Iraq. But in both cases, as well as in the opposition revealed in public opinion polls around the world, what seems to be driving the resistance is a gestalt much like the one "Pacem in Terris" emphasized 40 years ago: in this instance, the total pattern of American policy.

HEADLINE: Accounts Chock-Full, Or a Plan Half Empty? 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
The White House's proposal to simplify and expand tax-preferred savings accounts has just one problem: it may not increase saving.
 Instead, economists say, its main impact may be to tilt the tax system away from its current bias in favor of immediate consumption. At the same time, if it becomes law, it is expected to shift some tax revenue from the distant future to the present. 
 Since Congress approved the first I.R.A.'s in 1974, economists have tried to measure whether people use such programs to save more or just transfer money from existing saving accounts that lack a tax advantage. The evidence has been mixed. Yet skepticism over the administration's latest proposal was widespread, even uniting academics who have long disagreed about the effects of tax-preferred plans on household saving. 
"When one thinks, 'Are we going to get a lot more saving out of this?' I just don't know," said David A. Wise, a professor at Harvard whose research indicates that I.R.A.'s and 401(k)s promote extra saving.
His sometime rival, John Karl Scholz, a professor of economics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, was even more dismissive. "My best guess is that this would reduce private saving in aggregate," Professor Scholz said, "rather than increase private saving." 
Despite their differences, both economists agree that few people are constrained by current limits on contributions to I.R.A.'s and 401(k) plans. So the higher limits in the administration's proposal might not have much effect on saving.
The new program would allow individuals to put away up to $15,000 of their after-tax income each year into two separate accounts, with no taxes on any earnings from their saving. Each year, the maximum contribution would rise with inflation. All the money in the new accounts, known as Lifetime Savings Accounts, could be taken out at any time tax free, while the money set aside in the expanded Retirement Savings Accounts would remain saved until age 58, except in cases of death or disability.
"That's going to take care of almost everybody's saving," said Gary V. Engelhardt, an associate professor of economics at Syracuse University. Except for the wealthiest families, the $30,000 that a married couple could put aside every year would be more than enough to cover what they can afford to save. "Effectively all your saving is going to be sheltered," Professor Engelhardt said.
Even with higherlimits on tax-preferred saving, the government might have a hard time encouraging more people to begin putting money aside. "You're not going to get the participation rates you do in employer-based plans," said William G. Gale, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a liberal policy group.
Professor Wise agreed. For most people, he said, "this is small potatoes relative to 401(k) plans." Replacing saving plans aimed at medical care and higher education with one lifetime account, Mr. Engelhardt warned, could also curb savers' enthusiasm.
Nevertheless, Mr. Gale noted, economists have little data to use in forecasting the behavior of high-income people, who are currently barred from contributing to Roth I.R.A.'s, which work in the same way as the new accounts.
Contributions to traditional I.R.A.'s, which offer an upfront tax deduction in exchange for being taxed at ordinary income rates when money is withdrawn, would stop under the White House's plan. Their replacement could even lead to lower saving rates, Professor Wise said.
"The upfront deduction is the thing that gets people's attention," he argued. "I would question whether you might not have a decline in contributions."
He predicted that some middle-income people who contribute to traditional I.R.A.'s would not switch to the new accounts, because they would no longer receive the immediate tax break.
"It's clear that it is going to be skewed toward upper-income individuals," Mr. Engelhardt said.
Indeed, that is almost unavoidable. Most proposals to increase saving inherently favor the well-to-do because they are the only ones who can afford to set aside income beyond their immediate needs. "They do proportionally more saving than lower-income individuals," Mr. Engelhardt said. Moreover, the wealthy have a greater incentive to avoid taxation. "They face higher marginal tax rates," he said, "and have bigger tax benefits from these types of vehicles."
Combined with President Bush's plan to protect dividend income from personal taxes, this latest proposal also moves toward a goal long favored by a number of economists, including R. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers: the transformation of the income tax into a tax on consumption.
With a pure consumption tax, there is no disadvantage to spending money in the future instead of the present; the tax -- effectively paid at the time of a purchase -- is always the same. In a sense, eliminating taxes on saving achieves the same goal, even with an income tax in place. That transformation would be on the horizon if the new saving rules became law. "I can't imagine that there's ever going to be a taxable dividend or capital gain or anything else if we do this and the president's other proposal," Mr. Gale said.
Aside from its effects on the character of the tax system and income inequality, making the entire savings of almost all Americans eligible for a tax shelter could also put a dent in the government's annual revenue.
"Clearly the government's going to forgo a lot of tax revenue," Professor Scholz said. "Households with two incomes -- like me and my lawyer wife -- we'll be real capable of taking full advantage of these things."
After 20 years, an individual who saved at the program's maximum levels could have $300,000 in principal yielding tax-free income. But while the government would be giving up a big revenue stream in the future, the new accounts are likely to generate extra taxes in the near term to the extent people with traditional I.R.A.'s take up the Treasury's offer to convert them.
"If they get people to convert existing funds, and pay a tax on the conversion, they'll show a big gain in revenue in the short term, and a big loss in the long term," Mr. Gale said. "It's a gimmick, in that it's shifting revenue from the future to now."

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Approves Biotechnology Drug for Psoriasis 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
The Food and Drug Administration has approved Amevive, the first drug from the biotechnology industry to treat psoriasis, opening what doctors say will be a new era in treating the disease, a sometimes debilitating skin ailment.
 The approval of the drug, announced yesterday by its manufacturer, Biogen, could also fuel a new growth spurt for the 25-year-old company. Sales of its only product until now, the multiple sclerosis treatment Avonex, have been flattening, and it faces new competition. 
 Doctors said Amevive, as well as several other biotechnology drugs that are expected to be approved in the next two years, could help patients with severe psoriasis without the side effects of existing drugs, which can cause liver or kidney damage. 
"There's hope for safe and effective long-term control of this disease," said Dr. Alice Gottlieb, a professor at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey, who has been active in testing Amevive and other psoriasis drugs. Gail M. Zimmerman, president of the National Psoriasis Foundation, a patient advocacy group that receives donations from Biogen and other companies, called the new drugs "the most significant advance in psoriasis care in 20 years." 
Psoriasis is characterized by reddened skin covered by a silvery scale. About 1.5 million American adults have moderate to severe psoriasis. Biogen, based in Cambridge, Mass., said it expected to sell at least $85 million worth of Amevive this year and $500 million in 2005. 
Amevive, known generically as alefacept, is given as an injection in a doctor's office once a week for 12 weeks. Biogen will sell the drug to wholesalers for about $7,000 to $10,000 for the 12-week course. Patients and insurers are likely to pay about $8,400 to $11,900, said Ronald Renaud, an analyst at Bear, Stearns. 
The price, plus the fact that Amevive is injected, could discourage some patients from switching from methotrexate, an existing drug that costs only $1,000 to $2,000 a year and can be taken orally, though it can cause liver damage.
"We are really going to face a hard question on the economic side," said Dr. Steve Feldman, professor of dermatology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. 
Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that occurs when the body's defense system against microbial invaders mistakenly attacks the skin. Amevive is a genetically engineered protein that blocks certain immune system cells, known as T cells. But because lower T-cell levels can leave people prone to infection, Amevive users will have to have their blood T-cell counts checked weekly and will have to wait at least 12 weeks after finishing one course of treatment before starting another. 
In clinical trials, Amevive produced a 75 percent improvement in psoriasis in 15 percent to 40 percent of patients, depending on how it was administered and for how long. 
Some analysts think Biogen will not achieve its sales goals because Amevive will lose out to other drugs, particularly Enbrel from Amgen. That drug is already approved for rheumatoid arthritis and for psoriatic arthritis, a joint condition, and is now in late-stage trials for psoriasis. Enbrel seems to work in a higher percentage of patients than Amevive, though it can be misleading to compare results from different trials. Also, since Enbrel has been used for five years for arthritis, doctors might be more comfortable with its safety. 
"I think down the road Enbrel ends up becoming the incumbent psoriasis therapy and everything else is second to that," said Mr. Renaud of Bear, Stearns, who once worked for Amgen. He said Biogen should have priced Amevive lower to compete better with Enbrel, which costs about $12,000 to $15,000 a year.
Genentech and Xoma applied to the F.D.A. in December for approval of their psoriasis drug, Raptiva, which could be the next one to reach the market after Amevive. Remicade from Johnson & Johnson, already approved for rheumatoid arthritis, has also shown effectiveness against psoriasis in clinical trials. 
But Biogen, being first to market, has the chance to establish itself. Amevive's big selling point is that when it does work, patients' skin can remain clear for months. "Duration has always been the hallmark of our discussions" with doctors, said Doug Abel, vice president in charge of Biogen's dermatology business.
Shares of Biogen rose 26 cents yesterday, to $38.25.
While psoriasis is sometimes viewed as merely a cosmetic disease, it can be painful and severely disrupt lives. "Your whole body is on fire," said Diane Lewis, a 34-year-old artist in San Francisco. "You wake up bloody and stuck to bedsheets." 
Ms. Lewis received Amevive along with ultraviolet light, another treatment, in a clinical trial. Three months after the treatment ended, her skin is still clear and she finds it almost unnerving that the disease no longer controls her life. 
"I can dress however I want," she said. "I was able to book a trip to Europe without any thought" of skin condition.

HEADLINE: Details Given On New Plans To Aid Saving 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
The Bush administration today unveiled its plan to create two new types of savings accounts that would allow a couple to save as much as $30,000 a year in funds that could be withdrawn, with any investment gains, free of taxes.
 Everyone would be able to contribute to the plans, with no limitations based on age or income. 
 For people with plenty of money, the accounts would offer powerful new ways to build wealth. A person could contribute up to $7,500 a year to a Lifetime Savings Account, which would generate investment income tax free, then use the money for any purpose, not just buying a home or paying for education. Withdrawals could be made at any age and would also be tax free. 
That same person could also contribute up to $7,500 a year to a Retirement Savings Account, which would replace today's individual retirement accounts and Roth accounts, among others. After the saver reached age 58, withdrawals would be free from taxes and penalties. The saver's spouse could set aside those amounts each year, a total of $15,000, in such accounts.
The accounts "make saving simple for everyone and for every purpose," stated Pamela F. Olson, the assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, in a department statement. "No longer will individuals have to worry about the confusing alphabet soup of six different savings accounts."
Though the proposals are described as simplifying the mix of saving plans, choosing the best way to harness the new plans would still be a complicated matter. .
"This is not going to be simplified, believe me," said Steven G. Lockwood, president of Lockwood Pension Services and the author of "Individual Retirement Account Answer Book."
"But it's all good news," he said. "People will walk away from this with more money." 
Some of the complexity would arise as savers make decisions about how to invest their money in the new accounts -- decisions with new twists if the administration's plan to make dividends tax exempt goes forward.
In addition, people would have to compare the merits of saving through one of the new individual accounts with those of any retirement account they are offered at work. The Bush administration is also proposing to reshape work-based retirement plans like the 401(k) account, calling the successor plans Employer Retirement Savings Accounts. The advantages and disadvantages would vary depending on each person's age, goals, tax bracket and other factors. 
Like many other financial analysts, Mr. Lockwood noted that the benefits of the new accounts would flow only to those who have money to save. The accounts would have little effect on people who live from paycheck to paycheck.
Indeed, some benefits consultants warned that the new accounts and proposed rule changes on accounts sponsored by employers could combine to eliminate the incentives for some companies to offer retirement savings plans to their workers.
"If you're a small-business employee, what this could potentially mean is your employer will no longer offer a program for you," said Brian H. Graff, executive director of the American Society of Pension Actuaries. 
The new accounts also appear to threaten certain existing financial services, because they would damp public enthusiasm for some investment instruments, like annuities and education savings accounts.
The proposals could provide a one-time increase in federal tax revenues. The new plans have incentives to encourage savers to withdraw money from their old individual savings accounts, pay the applicable taxes and put the funds into the new accounts. People who convert from I.R.A.'s in the first year, for example, will be allowed to stretch the tax payments over four years.
When those people retire, though, they will be able to receive income free from taxes, meaning less federal revenue in later years.
For employers, the Bush administration said it hoped to eliminate many of the rules now imposed on the structure of retirement accounts. The Treasury said it also wanted to reduce the number of work-based plans, consolidating such vehicles as the 401(k) plan, the Simple 401(k) plan, and the governmental 457 plan into a single format, the Employer Retirement Savings Account.
Employees eligible for the Employer Retirement Savings Account at work could contribute the amounts that they may now put into their 401(k) plans: $12,000 a year if they are younger than 50, and $14,000 a year if they are 50 or older. These maximum amounts would increase in the coming years, just as they do on 401(k) amounts.
The new consolidated account would be similar to the 401(k) account in many other ways. Companies would deduct workers' contributions from their paychecks before taxes, employers could offer to match worker contributions, and savers would pay taxes on money they withdrew after retirement.
Administration officials said that they believed that the variety of work-based accounts confuses employees, and the rules discourage companies from offering such plans.
"This is especially true of small employers who together employ 4 out of every 10 American workers," Ms. Olson said. "It's one important reason why only 50 percent of working Americans have any pension plan at all."
She said she believed that once the rules were stripped away, more companies would offer retirement savings programs to their workers, ultimately improving the financial well-being of elderly Americans. 
Employee-benefits specialists said, however, that they feared that the administration's package might have the opposite effect.
This is because some rules are intended to ensure that senior officials of companies -- particularly small companies -- do not set up retirement plans for their workers and direct most of the benefits to themselves, creating abusive tax shelters.
One such provision is the "top heavy" rule. It requires that when a small company creates a retirement plan that grants most of its benefits to top officials, the plan must also guarantee that the lowest-paid workers get contributions of at least 3 percent of their pay.
Another provision requires that companies that set up Simple 401(k) plans for their workers must offer to match 3 percent or more of employee contributions.
These rules have been criticized by companies because they make small businesses do considerable paperwork relative to the size of the benefits they bestow on low-income workers. Those workers might prefer cash to the small retirement benefit they receive, in any case.
The administration is proposing to repeal both rules, along with similar regulations that are meant to distribute the benefits of retirement plans more equally among workers and managers.
Mr. Graff said he was not convinced that large numbers of employers would set up Employer Retirement Savings Accounts for their companies if they no longer had to adhere to complex rules. He said that since small-business owners and their spouses would be able to put away $30,000 each year in the other new tax-advantaged accounts, they would have little need to create tax-advantaged savings plans at work.
"It's the rank and file who are going to lose out of the opportunity to get a matching contribution," he said, adding that millions of employees now participate in the Simple plans, which would be eliminated. Studies show that low-wage workers are unlikely to save anything at all for their retirement unless an employer deducts the money from their paychecks.
For savers whose employers now offer 401(k) accounts with matching money, Mr. Lockwood said the best strategy would be, first of all, to keep paying into the same accounts if the proposals are enacted. These accounts would automatically become Employer Retirement Savings Accounts, and while the new individual accounts would offer attractive features, he said, even they do not measure up to the value of matching payments from an employer. 
"It's Pension 101," he said. "You never turn your back on a match."
After that, any savers with still more money to set aside could turn to the individual accounts. Financial planners said that converting money from the older savings accounts to the new ones would probably pay off, even though it would mean paying taxes in the process. 
"That would be an individual decision depending on your age, how soon you want access to the money, what you want to invest in, your future tax bracket," Mr. Lockwood said. "You'd have to look at a lot of different factors."
Not least of which is how confident each saver is that the rules will not change again before he or she is ready to withdraw the money or retire.

HEADLINE: Indian Leader Cites Poverty and Pleads for Aid 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
The president of the National Congress of American Indians, which represents more than 250 tribes, called on Congress and President Bush today to "make good on its word" to provide financial aid for education, housing and health care while respecting the tribes' right to self-governance.
 The president of the group, Tex G. Hall, traveled here from his ranch in North Dakota to deliver what he called the first State of the Indian Nations address in the 60 years of the group. Rather than the customary dark suit worn by lawmakers and other power, Mr. Hall wore an open-collar shirt, jeans and a cowboy hat. 
 "Seven generations ago, the United States was engaged in forced removal of tribes to the lands west of the Mississippi," Mr. Hall said. "Today we carry the wounds of that legacy. But we are alive and well and strong." 
Mr. Hall covered many issues in his 60-minute speech, including the need to improve schools, roads, telephones, cable television and high-speed data lines on reservations. He also spoke of the need to improve efficiency in dealing with the government, of the urgent desire for development and the double-edged effects of gambling on reservations.
Casinos at some reservations have provided jobs and economic activity where few other options were available, Mr. Hall said. But of the more than 560 federally recognized tribes, slightly more than 200 have gambling, and fewer than 20 have generated the wealth that can transform a tribe's economy. He asked Washington to help create 100,000 jobs for Indians by 2010.
Mr. Hall focused on the survival of self-governing tribes, Indians' ability to leave poverty and unemployment and the well being and general quality of Indian life.
"One of the most important things to understand about American Indian tribes," he said, "is the simple fact that tribes are governments. Not nonprofit organizations, not interest groups, not an ethnic minority."
Mr. Hall urged lawmakers to address the "jurisdictional confusion" and said, "We need Congress to help clarify the authority of tribes to set and enforce laws on the lands they govern."
For generations, Indians have contended that Washington has lost or stolen millions of dollars earned on tribal lands. For years, the government has ignored or disputed the contentions without accounting for the money from oil, mineral, timber and grazing leases, whose proceeds go to a trust fund for the Indians. The conflict, which dates from 1887, entered a new stage in 1996, when the Indians sued the Interior Department, a case that has not been resolved.
Mr. Hall proposed a two-day meeting in the summer between tribal leaders and the administration and Congress to revise the trust fund accounts.
"Fixing this system will not be easy," he said, "and it will, unfortunately, be expensive. But it simply must be done." 
Indians are the fastest-growing segment of the population by percentage, Mr. Hall said, but they are haunted by troubling statistics. They have a life expectancy significantly shorter than other groups. More than one-fourth live in poverty, and unemployment on reservations averages nearly 14 percent, more than double the national rate.
The domestic violence rate is more than twice the national rate, with 75 percent of the incidents involving non-Indian offenders.

HEADLINE: A Serious Response to AIDS 

 BODY:
President Bush's decision to triple spending to fight AIDS overseas, announced in the State of the Union address, finally provides a response from Washington commensurate with the disease's catastrophic scale. Mr. Bush proposed committing $10 billion in new money over the next five years to an emergency plan for AIDS relief that would finance AIDS prevention, treatment and orphan care in some of the most hard-hit countries in Africa and the Caribbean. 
 Mr. Bush and his aides have often spoken of AIDS in apocalyptic terms, but never before proposed spending more than token sums. The president acknowledged that AIDS can be treated even in the poorest nations, and that the cost of doing so can be as reasonable as $300 a year per patient -- a price available only from generic producers. By using American assistance to buy generic drugs instead of brand-name medicines, Mr. Bush will allow millions more people to be treated. All this is especially encouraging given the administration's close ties to major drug companies, which have fought the use of generics. 
 We hope Congress will increase the American commitment to fight AIDS even more, and make a few other changes as well. One is to spend the money now. Mr. Bush is proposing only a $700 million increase for next year. Because the epidemic is exploding, AIDS money goes further when it is spent earlier.
Congress should also direct the bulk of Washington's contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the organization that the international community has established. Yesterday Health Secretary Tommy Thompson was elected chairman of the Global Fund's board. Mr. Bush wants to channel only $1 billion of the $10 billion through the organization. That would be a serious blow to the fund, which has more good proposals from countries than it can finance, and would eliminate the chance to raise matching funds from other nations.
The Bush administration's preference for unilateral solutions is likely to lead to a far less efficient use of the money. American conduits, such as the Agency for International Development, are not in a position to administer the funds, and it is counterproductive to build a parallel bureaucracy when an existing organization of proven efficiency and an identical mission desperately needs financing.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Environment Fits in Political Strategy

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
President Bush's prominent mentions of clean air, healthy forests and pollution-free cars in his State of the Union speech reflect what Republican strategists say is an effort to repair his image on environmental issues.
 It was no accident, the strategists say, that Mr. Bush made no mention of his more divisive goal to increase drilling in the Alaska wilderness or that his chief political adviser, Karl Rove, told reporters the other day that his boss was following Theodore Roosevelt's tradition of environmentalism. 
 With the possibility of war approaching, the strategists say the president needs to shore up his standing with suburban women and other crucial swing voters who say they are fearful about what they see as an imminent war with Iraq. Those constituencies, recent opinion polls show, are more likely than other voters to say they regard environmental protections as crucial work of government. 
A Republican pollster, Neil Newhouse, called Mr. Bush's steps insulation and likened them to the strategy of the president's brother Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida in his re-election campaign last year, when he pushed to restore the Everglades and ban offshore oil drilling, two priorities for Florida voters.
"It's an aggressive outreach effort to touch people who might not be impressed with this administration," Mr. Newhouse said. "It takes an issue potentially off the table. It's smart policy and it's smart politics."
Many of the administration's moves for deregulation have been criticized as anti-environment. That includes when the administration suggested that it would allow more arsenic in drinking water, weakening the antipollution rules for old electric power plants and allowing snowmobiles to continue in Yellowstone National Park.
Environmental advocates say the president's more recent proposals like the one for hybrid cars are small gestures, not backed up with financing and meant to repair political damage rather than charting a new course. 
John Podesta, President Bill Clinton's chief of staff who is an environmental advocate for the League of Conservation Voters, said of Mr. Bush's renewed attention to environmental issues, "They clearly think they have a problem."
Mr. Podesta added that the president's words on the environment did not match his actions.
As part of the White House push to seize on issues that will appeal to suburban environment-conscious voters and to counter Democratic attacks, the administration showcased the women who head the three environment-related agencies. The day after the State of the Union speech, Christie Whitman of the Environmental Protection Agency, Ann M. Veneman of the Agriculture Department and Gale A. Norton of the Interior Department all appeared.
"Despite the fact that often times we get criticized," Ms. Veneman said, "we think that we have a very strong environmental record."
The administration, which Democrats say has ignored global warming, recently announced that it would hold an Earth Observation Summit in the summer to improve monitoring of the climate. It also proposed an increase in fuel economy standards for sport utility vehicles and pickups. The proposed increase of one and a half miles a gallon was criticized by opponents as minuscule, but it was the first such proposal in six years.
James L. Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said that despite negative reviews by Democrats, the administration was making progress on the environment and would promote its record in the 2004 campaign.
"We're talking about concrete results that are economically rational," Mr. Connaughton said. 
Pointing to programs on wetlands and proposals on clean air, he added, "The net improvements in terms of environmental outcomes are going to be huge."
Democrats are not likely to sit by while Mr. Bush makes a play for the environmental vote, a traditional Democratic constituency.
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrat who is a presidential contender, said Mr. Bush's comments in the State of the Union address were prompted by the realization that "public disappointment is now turning to anger about his unacceptable environmental record."
Another contender, former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, said that in the Northeast "it will be impossible for the president to win a single state, because of his undoing of the Clean Air Act. 
"And calling it Clear Skies," Dr. Dean said, "just makes people madder."
Polls show that the environment issue repeatedly favors Democrats. It is one of the few issues on which voters say they trust Democrats to do a better job than Republicans.
But the administration has learned a thing or two in recent years about handling environmental topics. After the outcry over its arsenic policy, when the administration suggested that it would allow more arsenic in drinking water, the administration became more sophisticated in its presentations.
Its rule, issued on Dec. 23, on rights of way across federal land, is an example. The administration said the measure would simply help straighten out property disputes. 
Yet a statement from Mr. Lieberman said, "This is the latest unjustifiable move in a seemingly unending campaign by the Bush administration to roll back or undercut our most basic environmental and public-health protections."
Such overheated language may be the only way for Democrats to draw attention to such issues. In the early days of the administration, environmental policy was a source of keen embarrassment to Mr. Bush. But since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, it has slid down the scale of importance.
At the same time, the administration became smarter about its presentation of environmental issues, many of which are quite technical. Some experts said the Democrats went overboard in predicting that the policies would wreak disaster.
Ben Lieberman, a senior policy expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, said: "There are legitimate environmental concerns, but the public doesn't buy the gloom-and-doom apocalyptic rhetoric from the Democrats. It's a low-priority issue."
The most recent Gallup Poll backs that up. It says people rank the environment as the 13th most important issue of 14, ahead of only abortion. Terrorism is first.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DISSENT; 
Antiwar Sentiment Appears In County Seats and City Halls

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 31 

 BODY:
Spurred by local antiwar sentiment, dozens of cities and counties around the country have passed resolutions imploring President Bush to slow down his confrontation with Iraq.
 Some of the resolutions ask for more evidence that Iraq is hiding weapons. Some urge Mr. Bush to work more closely with the United Nations. Almost all oppose a unilateral strike. 
 City and county councils in 20 states have passed such measures, from small towns like Woodstock, N.Y., to cities as large as Chicago, Philadelphia and Detroit.
Many have liberal leanings, like Berkeley, Calif.; Madison, Wis.; and Santa Fe, N.M. But others, like Des Moines; San Luis Obispo, Calif.; and Blaine County, Idaho, have large numbers of Republican voters.
This past week, resolutions were approved by the Board of Commissioners of Multnomah County, which includes Portland; and by city councils in Cleveland; Tacoma, Wash.; Nederland, Colo.; Amherst, Mass.; and Topanga, Calif., bringing to 57 the number of municipalities that have acted. Together, they represent about 13 million people.
More resolutions may be on the way. Officials at the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, a nonpartisan group helping to organize municipal campaigns against the war, said that nearly 70 other cities and counties -- and one state legislature, Maine's -- were considering similar resolutions.
"Ours reflects a growing ambivalence, even opposition, to a military invasion of Iraq," said Alderman Joe Moore of Chicago, the largest city to take a stand, in a 46-to-1 vote two weeks ago. "There's a strong feeling here that the president has not made the case that we should depart from 200 years of history of not launching a preemptive strike against another nation."
The resolutions stray far from the disputes over garbage and teacher salaries that usually ensnare local governments.
In some places, officials have resisted taking a symbolic stand on foreign policy, an issue reserved for the United States Congress. Last week, Portland's usually liberal City Council heard two hours of fervent testimony before a 2-to-2 vote killed a similar resolution.
But on Thursday, by a 4-to-1 vote, the county Board of Commissioners trumped its largest city, passing a measure that opposes a "threatened violation of the United Nations Charter by unilateral, pre-emptive military action against the sovereign nation of Iraq, and the dangerous precedent such action would establish." It urges Mr. Bush and Congress to work "with and through" the United Nations.
"The time to express our concern is now," said Commissioner Serena Cruz, a cosponsor of the Multnomah County measure, "before our troops are put in harm's way."
Clare Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, dismissed the notion that antiwar resolutions represent a split in public opinion. "We're confident that the American people will support the president if Saddam Hussein chooses not to disarm peacefully and the United States leads a coalition to disarm him," she said.
But conservatives stand ready to try to mobilize a countermovement. Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, said his organization had sent every state legislature a proposed measure for adoption the day fighting starts that supports Mr. Bush's actions.
The resolutions are just one sign of an active antiwar movement. Today, the group Win Without War began airing a 30-second television spot featuring Bishop Melvin G. Talbert, the chief ecumenical officer of the United Methodist Church, which counts President Bush as a member.
In the advertisement, Bishop Talbert says that going to war "violates God's law and the teachings of Jesus Christ."
The advertisement also includes actress Janeane Garofalo, who asks whether the United States has the right to invade a country that "has done nothing to us."
While some local officials echo such sentiments, for others -- including county commissioners here -- the issue is not just the use of force, but the cost of war.
They say a war effort would cost billions of dollars that are desperately needed by cities and states, which have been hurt by the economic slowdown and the new costs of security since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
"A protracted war with no sure end would have such a damaging effect on social spending," said Tom Hutchings, a city official in San Luis Obispo, where an antiwar resolution passed the City Council by a 4-to-1 vote this month. " This is not only a fiscal issue, but also a human issue." 
Some lawmakers call such symbolic stands a waste of time. Lonnie Roberts, an Army veteran and former state lawmaker who cast the dissenting vote in Multnomah County, said he would rather debate local issues.
Of the resolution, Mr. Roberts said, "I believe this would not make any difference in Washington, D.C., at all. I used to send memos to Congress all the time and never heard back."
Sponsors in many cities and towns are unsure whether the resolutions are having any effect. 
"I don't think the administration is paying us any attention," said W. Lee Smallwood, an Air Force veteran and city councilman in York, Pa., who sponsored a resolution that passed there by a 3-to-2 vote. "The administration is hell-bent on doing what it wants to do."
But Mayor Marty Blum of Santa Barbara, Calif., where a measure passed by a 4-to-1 vote, said, "With antiwar resolutions passing and people marching, I feel like the administration must be listening.
"In September," Mr. Blum said, "the president said he would go to war with Iraq and not talk to the U.N. Now it feels like there's some kind of hesitation. I feel like he's changed his tune, but who knows what he's hearing."

 BODY:
Days before city and state officials are scheduled to narrow the design competition for the World Trade Center site to two architecture teams, Larry A. Silverstein, the developer who holds the lease to the property, charged yesterday that rebuilding officials were ignoring his right to rebuild the site as he sees fit.
 In a letter to John C. Whitehead, the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Mr. Silverstein also said that none of the current designs for the site meet the requirements set out by rebuilding officials or the projected future demand for office space. In addition, he said, he believes that for safety reasons, the occupied parts of any building should be limited to no more than 65 or 70 stories -- significantly shorter than many of the proposed designs. 
 Though the letter, dated yesterday, was addressed to Mr. Whitehead, it was a shot across the bow of the entire rebuilding process and the political forces that are shaping it. Copies of the letter were sent to the governors of New York and New Jersey, the mayor, officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and others.
The letter, laced with references to ways that Mr. Silverstein could make rebuilding tough if not impossible, makes it clear that he and the Port Authority, which owns the site, disagree on some significant points.
Mr. Silverstein said he controlled the insurance reimbursement funds from the destruction of the trade center, "the only private source of funds for redevelopment." Rebuilding officials have privately disputed that assertion, saying that ultimately the Port Authority is entitled to the money.
Mr. Silverstein says his lease gives him the right to rebuild if the buildings on the site are destroyed, but he and rebuilding officials disagree about exactly what he is entitled to rebuild.
A representative in Mr. Silverstein's office said that he was traveling yesterday afternoon and could not be reached for comment. Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said the letter was not intended to threaten the rebuilding effort or the officials managing it. Rather, he said, "it is an effort to get this program moving effectively, utilizing the insurance funds that will come to him to rebuild."
"He wants to work with the process so that the final product will meet the needs of downtown," Mr. Rubenstein said.
In a phone call and a second letter to Mr. Whitehead yesterday, Mr. Silverstein sought to reassure him that he wanted to build "spectacular, architecturally distinguished buildings" that would restore the skyline and provide for active street life.
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said that Mr. Silverstein's voice was important in the rebuilding process, but was "not the only voice."
Matthew Higgins, a spokesman for the development corporation, disputed Mr. Silverstein's contention that many of the designs were not feasible. "We respect Larry Silverstein's opinion, along with the views of so many who have an interest in the future of the World Trade Center site, including the public," he said.
Greg Trevor, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said: "Larry Silverstein is an important stake holder in this process. The Port Authority will certainly take his views into account."
The timing of Mr. Silverstein's letter was notable. On Monday, eight officials -- representatives of the development corporation, the Port Authority, the mayor's office and the governor -- are scheduled to meet to choose two or more teams of architects as semifinalists in the design process for the trade center site.
They are expected to agree to request further work on designs by Studio Daniel Libeskind, whose plan would create a memorial space in the excavated pit where the towers stood, and by Think, a collaboration of architects whose favored plan includes two lattice-work towers devoted to educational, civic and cultural facilities.
According to officials who have been reviewing the designs, the Libeskind and Think plans have gained favor with the development corporation's site-planning committee as well as with a plurality, at least, of city, state and authority officials.
The officials said the Libeskind and Think plans most gracefully combined space for a memorial to the victims with cultural venues, transportation centers and potential office and retail space.
Whichever team of architects is chosen, Mr. Silverstein said, he expects them to work with the architecture firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, which he has hired to develop a plan for the site. Rebuilding officials expect to select the winning designer by the end of February.
Rebuilding officials face an additional challenge in making their decision: how much attention to pay to public comments that strongly favor a third plan, by Foster and Partners, that calls for giant, twinned towers evoking the original twin towers.
Rebuilding officials have expressed consistent doubt that enough companies could be found to occupy the upper floors of buildings as tall as the original towers. And Mr. Silverstein says in his letter that rebuilding towers more than 1,000 feet high is not only unsafe but is also economic folly.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR ISSUE; 
Admiral Seeks Deterrent Force In Korea Crisis

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31 

 BODY:
The commander of American forces in the Pacific, Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, has requested additional air and naval forces as a deterrent against North Korea, in the first military response to the escalating crisis over the country's nuclear program, Pentagon officials said tonight.
 The request for at least one squadron of warplanes has been under discussion for several days, a Pentagon official said. So far, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has not approved the request, but the officials said he appeared inclined to grant Admiral Fargo's request to send the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson to the area. That way, the Korean peninsula would not be left without full military coverage should the carrier Kitty Hawk, based in Japan, be sent to the Persian Gulf to help in an action against Iraq. 
 "These are deterrent-type forces that would be put in place," a Defense Department official said, while emphasizing that the administration's policy of pushing for a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis remained unchanged. 
A senior Pentagon official called consideration of the request "very careful, prudent planning" that did not signal imminent military action.
The request, first reported tonight by The CBS Evening News, did not mention additional ground troops. This suggests that the forces could be meant as assistance in the event that President Bush ordered any kind of pre-emptive strike against the North's nuclear complex at Yongbyon. Satellite photographs have revealed a flurry of unexplained activity at the complex since international inspectors were ejected on Dec. 31. 
President Bill Clinton began a similar reinforcement in 1994, during the last nuclear crisis with North Korea. 
Earlier today, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei, said it might be a matter of only "weeks and months" before North Korea began turning its stockpile of nuclear fuel into weapons. He urged that the issue be referred to the United Nations Security Council. 
Only hours later, the White House played down the significance of the American spy satellite photographs of the activity at Yongbyon, insisting that it was too early to conclude that the North was racing to produce a half-dozen nuclear weapons.
Despite its differences with Dr. ElBaradei over the urgency of the Korea issue, the White House said today that it would welcome involving the Security Council. But an administration official said tonight that the Council would simply be asked to pass a resolution or a statement, without threatening economic sanctions or isolation. "We want to take it to the Security Council, but not with any thought of immediate punitive action," the official said.
South Korea and China have warned the administration that sanctions would only deepen tensions with Kim Jong Il, the North's reclusive leader. In radio broadcasts, the North Korean government has said several times that it would regard sanctions as an act of aggression that would bring retaliation.
The administration's strategy, officials said today, is to force North Korea to hear the condemnation of a number of nations -- including Asian neighbors -- in hopes of convincing North Korea's leaders that they will never get aid or investment while they pursue their nuclear programs.
Mr. Bush, the aides say, is determined not to satisfy Mr. Kim -- a man he once said he "loathed" -- by turning the dispute into a confrontation with Washington alone. North Korean officials repeated today that they would deal only with the United States, and would never negotiate with international organizations.
At the White House today, officials veered between avoiding any alarms about the North's recent activities and warning the North that actually reprocessing fuel into plutonium would be a major mistake.
"Any steps toward beginning reprocessing would be yet another provocative action by North Korea intended to intimidate and blackmail the international community," Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's press secretary, told reporters. 
Mr. Fleischer's comments were devoid of any threat against crossing what experts have long considered a "red line" -- the beginning of production of plutonium. The Clinton administration declared in 1994 that it could not allow North Korea to develop a sizable nuclear arsenal, which could be used to threaten Japan or American troops in Asia.
Officials suggested that drawing such stark lines would only invite the North to test the administration's will. But some officials warn that North Korea could see the failure to issue a strong warning as a sign that it was free to produce weapons. 
"We've been talking about a lot of very ugly scenarios that could play out in the next few weeks," said a senior official involved in discussing possible military responses if North Korea escalated the crisis by beginning to reprocess nuclear fuel.
"What happens if they set off a nuclear test?" he asked. "If they launch another missile test? If they demand food, with a threat of using weapons?" 
"These guys are clearly watching television, and timing their moves when they think attention is on Saddam," he added, referring to Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
Mr. Bush never mentioned North Korea during his news conference today with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, in keeping with the strategy of depriving Mr. Kim of the opportunity to be seen rankling the president. But at one point, he made a broad statement that seemed to apply to Iraq, North Korea and other potential threats. "After September the 11th," he said, "the doctrine of containment just doesn't hold any water, as far as I'm concerned." 
If applied to North Korea, Mr. Bush's statement would seem to suggest that the strategy of the last 50 years, placing American and South Korean troops in the demilitarized zone, is no longer enough to protect the world from North Korea's nuclear capacity or efforts to sell missiles and other weapons abroad.
But in the past, Mr. Bush's aides have suggested that North Korea -- unlike Iraq -- can be successfully contained. On the ABC News program "Nightline" on Oct. 17, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, said, "We have a military presence on the Korean peninsula that can take account of that danger and that can check Kim Jong Il." 
Ms. Rice and her aides have concluded that even if North Korea speeds ahead with its nuclear program, the United States has few good military options. While the Pentagon has extensive contingency plans for attacking the North Korean nuclear complex, it would be an enormously risky operation -- perhaps involving hundreds of thousands of casualties if the North responded by attacking Seoul, the South Korean capital, which is only 30 miles from the border. 
The deployment of an aircraft carrier with an air wing to the Korean theater to replace the Kitty Hawk would leave a total of nearly 350 American strike and combat-support aircraft based in South Korea and Japan, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
Although American officials said today that they were keeping all their options open, including the military ones, they said they still saw plenty of room for diplomacy. 
"The United States has no intention of attacking North Korea," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in a speech today, repeating a commitment made several times in recent months.

HEADLINE: The Outsider 

BYLINE:  By Matt Bai; Matt Bai is a contributing writer for the magazine. His last article was a profile of Jean Carnahan.

 BODY:
Gary Hart is standing in the kitchen of his cabin in the Denver foothills, where, for a week about 15 years ago, he and his family hid from the news media by pinning sheets over the windows. "You couldn't know what kind of nightmare that was if you haven't lived through it," he says. Now the former senator and two-time presidential candidate is leaning against the oven in a black turtleneck sweater, holding a glass of white wine in one hand and a fistful of assorted nuts in the other. A decade in the political wilderness will do things to a man, and Hart looks considerably more weathered than the young candidate in old photos. 
 He is trying to explain why he would risk reliving the nightmare by running for president once again. It is a decision he is mulling and expects to make by April, after delivering a series of weighty speeches on national security, foreign policy and economics. 
 "Walter Mondale can just go away," Hart says. "John Glenn can go away. Michael Dukakis can go away. I can't just go away." 
"Why?" asks his wife, Lee, who is sitting at the kitchen island. She has been married to him for 44 years, and yet she seems to ask this not for my benefit, but because it is a question she would genuinely like to have answered.
"I don't know," Hart says, shaking his head. He thinks, then repeats himself. "I don't know. I don't know.
"Let me answer you with a question," Hart tells me finally, although I wasn't the one who asked the question to begin with. "If I weren't thinking about doing this" -- that is, running again -- "would you be here right now?"
I allow that I probably wouldn't.
"Well," he says, spreading his arms triumphantly. "There are only two places to be in American life -- on the sidelines or on the playing field. I don't need to run for president. But I do want to be heard."
Hart's undoing in 1987, as most everyone knows, was brought on by the fling he was accused of having with Donna Rice, a part-time model and aspiring actress. (Hart famously challenged the media to "put a tail" on him, though he maintains that he didn't mean it literally.) The resulting expose brought on the collapse of a presidential campaign that many thought was headed for the White House and sent Hart into political isolation for more than a decade. "Exile" is the word he uses.
Then, through a combination of persistence and fluke, Hart found himself appointed co-chairman of what would come to be known as the Hart-Rudman Commission on national security, which essentially predicted the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Suddenly, Hart is back on cable TV and the lecture circuit, the beneficiary at last of a modest revival.
He insists that if he runs for president again, it will be for no other reason than to win. But as he talks about a campaign, Hart betrays no obvious passion for what is the most torturous undertaking in politics. (A trained psychologist, which I'm not, might suggest that Hart was always ambivalent about seeking the presidency; his behavior in 1987 was classically self-destructive.) What Hart really wants, it seems, is to be a kind of elder statesman, sought out and consulted on issues of global importance -- the Democratic Henry Kissinger. This is where his career was heading, he figures, all those years ago, before reporters from The Miami Herald skulked around his town house as if they were playing Magnum, P.I. 
"I made a mistake," Hart says. "I think there are very few people in the world who don't know that. I've apologized. It was a single incident 15 years ago. It denied me the right and the opportunity to serve my country for at least 12 years. And I think I've paid my dues." He points out that both Adm. John Poindexter, a convicted felon in the Iran-contra scandal (his conviction was later overturned on a technicality), and Elliott Abrams, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of withholding information from Congress (he was later pardoned by Bush senior), hold posts in the present administration. 
"One would think, if there's any degree of fairness in life at all, that if convicted felons can be back in public service, then someone like myself can be," he continues. "I think all I want is some degree of fairness. I'm not even asking for forgiveness, but fairness." He pauses, sighs, shakes his head. "Perspective," he says. "Perspective."
When I ask why he hasn't been accorded that perspective, Hart waves me off. "Someone else will have to answer that," he replies. There's something odd in this response -- who exactly is supposed to answer it, if not him? -- just as there is something odd in the way that Hart has remained, unfairly, a stale punch line from the 80's, the political equivalent of a Members Only jacket. After all, Joe Biden, who left that same presidential campaign in disgrace for recycling someone else's speeches, is more respected than ever. Bill Clinton, whose own sex scandal made a permanent dent in the American culture, left office with enviable popularity nonetheless. And yet here I am, asking Gary Hart about a tryst he may or may not have had 15 years ago. There must be a reason.
Hart answers my questions graciously, but he pleads with me to move on already. "This whole business of '87 is flypaper to me," he says wearily. "It's so frustrating. It's like being in a time warp. I'm stuck. I want to get unstuck."
On an arctic afternoon just before Christmas, Hart and I walked over to the Denver Athletic Club, where he was giving a speech at a luncheon of the state bar association. Hart almost never wears a coat, so he walked with his hands thrust into his pockets, in which he carried not a single note or visual aid. The lawyer who was organizing the event, Tom McNamara, greeted Hart outside the banquet room. "They told me you need about 15 minutes for the speech," he said.
"Sixteen and a half minutes," Hart replied. He was serious.
At the lectern, Hart proceeded to horrify his audience by explaining how easy it would be to ship a bomb from Singapore to Long Beach, put it on a train for Newark and detonate it by remote in Chicago. "It is going to happen here," Hart warned. "Next time, will it be New York City? I don't think so. It'll be Denver, Cleveland and Dallas. I think it'll be multiple targets and biological."
If the United States invades Iraq, Hart said, the danger will be exponentially greater. "However else you feel about the Iraqi war," he said, "don't assume that it's going to suppress the threat. It's going to stimulate the threat, and our finding is that we're not ready."
This is not the type of hopeful rhetoric you expect to hear from a presidential hopeful. But then, Hart is not in a "Morning in America" kind of mood. "I feel like I'm the grinch who stole Christmas," Hart says. "I guess part of what motivates me now is that, if something bad happens, at least I don't want to have the feeling that I should have given one more speech, or that I should have been a little scarier."
Hart spends most days in the Denver office of Coudert Brothers, the law firm where he brokers business deals overseas. After leaving Washington, the onetime divinity student returned to his roots as an academic. He picked up a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford in 2001, at age 64. He has written seven books since leaving office, both nonfiction and novels. His latest is a treatise on the Jeffersonian ideal, adapted from his Oxford thesis. ("I have an 18th-century mind," Hart says.) Another book, "The Patriot: An Exhortation to Liberate America From the Barbarians," was intended as a modern-day interpretation of Machiavelli. Neither made Oprah's list. 
After he withdrew from electoral politics, Hart still wanted to be an influential player in the foreign-policy world. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he had traveled all over the world and pioneered military reforms -- the need for smaller, lighter ships and high-tech weaponry, for instance -- now embraced by Donald Rumsfeld, among others. Hart saw himself as a valuable adviser.
In fact, although he hasn't talked about it publicly, Hart undertook some clandestine missions overseas during the 1990's, always acting on his own initiative. In 1991, Hart says, he flew to Tripoli, Libya, at the behest of a foreign contact and, after being detained there for three days, received an offer from the Libyans to extradite the men accused of bombing Pan Am 103. He says that the Bush administration turned the offer down. In 1998, Hart had dinner with Fidel Castro in Cuba because he wanted to discuss the Kennedy assassination. (Castro suspected the mob.) Upon his return, Hart stopped by the White House to pass along Castro's assertion that certain Cuban-Americans were sponsoring terrorism against him.
It's painful to imagine being Gary Hart during the Clinton years. Hart had been, after all, the leader of the "Atari Democrats," a new breed of centrist, techno-savvy thinkers. He had spent years thinking and writing about how to move his party to the center on issues like welfare and crime and how to remake the military for the post-cold-war period. Now, as a disgraced Hart watched from his cabin, Clinton was the one who was reshaping Democratic politics, ushering in the Internet age, navigating ethnic war in the Balkans -- and all despite marital infidelities that made Hart look like a homebody. Hart had to wonder too if any of this would have been possible without him; having been the test case for a national discussion about politicians and their sex lives, Hart probably made it possible for Clinton to rise above the issue a few years later. This could not have been easy.
Throughout the 90's, Hart -- at Clinton's request, he says -- wrote the president letters expressing his views on a spectrum of issues. Friends tried to get him a more official role, but the phone in the cabin never rang. "A Clinton confidant and publicly known figure said to me that it was the political people in the White House who would dissuade the president," Hart says. "Every time my name came up, they said, 'Don't touch it.' That's hard to know." 
Hart's break finally came in 1998, when Clinton named him to the little-noted Commission on National Security/21st Century. The bipartisan panel was given the impossibly broad task of envisioning the future of national security, and two former senators, the New Hampshire Republican Warren Rudman and David Boren, Democrat from Oklahoma, were charged with leading it. After a few months, however, Boren had to relinquish the chairmanship, and Clinton's defense secretary, William Cohen, who had written a novel with Hart, suggested elevating him to co-chairman. It was a pragmatic choice; not only was Hart qualified, but unlike most of the 14 commissioners, he also actually had the time to do the work. 
The members who had known Hart for years noticed that he was at first a more tentative man than he had been in the Senate. "He had become quite subdued over the years," says Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. "But the more that committee went on, the more his old assertiveness came back." Hart traveled more than any of his colleagues and rewrote critical parts of one commission report himself. "I haven't seen a senior official do that since I can't remember when," Gelb says.
In its first of three reports, the commission warned, "Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers." That was Sept. 15, 1999. The commission also came up with the idea for a homeland security department. This was a stunningly prescient effort, and it might have led to the kind of role Hart would have coveted -- meetings on the Hill, briefings with the president. But as the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11 faded, politics ruled the day; rather than being whisked away to secure locations, Hart and Rudman didn't receive much credit for their work, and it took months to get a White House meeting with the new homeland security chief, Tom Ridge.
While working on the commission, Hart was also studying at Oxford, where he had taken to hanging out with a bunch of young Rhodes scholars. After they returned to the States, Hart's new friends started pressing him to run for president again. Inspired by this mini-draft, Hart now seems increasingly drawn to a campaign. His wife and two children, a son and daughter in their 30's, are more wary.
"Lee in particular is convinced it's going to be a nightmare," Hart says. "She's funny, because one minute it's 'You know they're never going to leave you alone.' And the next minute it's 'When are you going to New Hampshire?' I've been kind of amused and touched by it."
In recent weeks, Hart has been calling around to a few old friends to ask their advice, and some have been encouraging. "He has a tremendous amount to offer, and it doesn't seem like any of the other voices in the Democratic Party have addressed the country's security needs, especially in these times," says the mayor of Baltimore, Martin O'Malley, a Hart protege and a star within the party. "I'd have a hard time not supporting Senator Hart if he ran."
Aside from national security, Hart's message is, essentially, the same one he has been preaching for roughly 30 years: the old Democratic Party is out of energy and out of ideas. That sounds especially believable at the moment, although it's not yet clear what Hart's fresher vision for the party would actually entail. When Hart ran in 1984, Walter Mondale charged that he had lots of gauzy ideas and no details. ("Where's the beef?" the vice president famously asked.) Stung, Hart came back three years later with his Strategic Investment Initiative, a collection of more specific proposals on issues like public-school reform and job creation through rebuilding infrastructure.
When I asked Hart if he had similar proposals now, he explained to me his theory of the four simultaneous revolutions shaping American life: the explosion of information, globalization, the evolution of the nation-state and the changing nature of armed conflict. In fairness to Hart, he recognized these themes long before other politicians of his generation, but they're all pretty familiar by now. When I asked him for specific policies that would tie all this together, he replied, "I'm working on it." 
If Hart's position papers aren't yet finalized, he certainly has no trouble with the vision thing. "The essential intellectual challenge," he told me, "is how to make liberalism relevant for our time. How do you make the principles of equality and justice and fairness work in a time when everyone's well off? I struggle with that every day. In my darkest soul, I sometimes wonder if it takes an economic depression."
Hart admits that he can't distill this search for modern liberalism into a pithy slogan. ("Hart: It Takes a Depression" probably won't work.) Nevertheless, Hart's friends are able to imagine a set of circumstances in which his candidacy would rock the early Democratic primaries. If the country were to become mired in a protracted war, or if another attack were to succeed on American soil, the campaign could easily become dominated by national security. Hart could credibly claim to know more about terrorism and how to stop it than any Democrat, and he might be the only candidate in a strong position to criticize Bush for letting it happen.
Before Hart could seize the opportunity, however, he'd have to make some accommodation to political reality. He admits that he has no idea how to raise money. He says he wouldn't want to make campaign ads, except maybe to speak directly into the camera about national security. And even Hart's closest friends say they can't really imagine him hiking tirelessly through the snow in Manchester or Davenport, shaking hands in bowling alleys and late-night diners. In other words, his denials to the contrary, Hart seems more bent on making a statement than on running for real.
If he does become a candidate, Hart knows he will face all the same questions all over again. Reporters will want to know if Hart thinks he was a kind of inoculating antibody against sex scandals, the way Douglas Ginsburg, who gave up his bid for the Supreme Court, seemed to clear the way for others who once smoked pot. They will try to get a comment from Donna Rice, now an antipornography crusader. They will want to know how Hart feels. 
These are the kinds of questions that are asked of politicians, but not of elder statesmen. People close to Hart say he has considered a novel approach to all this: he could hold a single news conference, vowing to answer any and all questions on the scandal, but only once. This has entertaining possibilities -- you can imagine Hart in his second hour of discourse on the Jeffersonian ideal while reporters from "Extra" snore in their chairs -- but it probably wouldn't put the issue to rest.
"I don't want to talk about it," Hart told me. "Let somebody write a thesis about what my role in all this was. I don't care. I've moved so far beyond this."
This is Hart's peculiar myopia. He is a symbol, after all, of the moment when the boundaries between private and political lives came crashing down forever. Yet the man who holds a doctorate in philosophy from Oxford -- who can unravel the larger significance of everything from Machiavellian principle to the fall of the Soviet Union -- cannot find a way to examine his own place in American life. And this is probably why he has never been able to shed the aura of scandal.
The problem, at bottom, is that Gary Hart never really liked politics very much, with all its pep rallies and elbow-grabbing; he liked the ideas, the big stuff. And rehabilitating yourself from scandal doesn't happen by writing obscure books about the philosophy of revolution. It happens by schmoozing the right people and hiring image consultants and all the other less lofty things that modern politics have become.
Still, Hart devotes himself doggedly to his speeches on homeland security and to his latest book idea -- a discussion of America's responsibilities abroad in the 21st century -- and waits, impatiently, for the statute of limitations on scandal to finally lapse. If nothing else, at least he is being heard again. As we walked through Denver's downtown pedestrian mall, a few people noticed Hart and said hello. An African-American man in a wool coat smiled as he passed.
"Hey, Gary!" he said. "Been a long time!"
Hart waved. "It sure has been," he said.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Pictures Worth 10,000 Words, at Least

BYLINE:  By RICHARD B. WOODWARD; Richard B. Woodward has been a visiting critic in photography at Columbia University's Graduate School of the Arts, the Rhode Island School of Design and other schools.

 BODY:
"IF you can't make it good, make it big," New York street photographers used to say in the 70's, adding with even more sarcasm, "and if you can't make it big, make it red." 
 As a Bronx cheer for an art world that had begun to turn its back on its 35-millimeter aesthetic, the adage was true enough for its time. The 70's was when the 8-by-10-inch print started to look small. Color was slowly muscling its way into museums, and several well-known artists responded by conspicuously bulking-up in black-and-white. In 1975 Richard Avedon created a sensation by exhibiting three photographic murals at the Marlborough Gallery in New York, one of them a 21-foot-long, life-size group portrait of Andy Warhol's Factory crew. Two years later, Irving Penn's blow-ups of trash from the city's streets graced the walls of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Even the grandfatherly Ansel Adams, meeting the demands of a hungry photography market in its infancy, reprinted images from his youth in ever increasing quantities and sizes. 
 But big in the 70's isn't big anymore. Not when the German artist Thomas Ruff makes color photographs of heads as large as entire bodies in Mr. Avedon's portraits. Mr. Penn's cigarette butts hardly register as oversize now. Like S.U.V.'s and television screens, photographs throughout the 90's swelled to almost irrational dimensions. As technology allowed huge color prints to be processed with ease and buyers paid top prices for them, big became the norm. Younger photographers and students, when asking themselves how large an image should be, often opted for the McDonald's answer: supersize it. 
The German artist Thomas Struth, 48, whose exhibition of 70 works opens on Tuesday at the Metropolitan Museum, has produced enormous photographs since the late 80's. His color prints typically measure 7 or 8 feet long and 4 or 5 feet wide when framed. And his "Video Portraits" are truly monumental at 14 feet high by 24 feet across. Never before seen in the United States, they will be projected in the Great Hall, just inside the Met's entrance.
In other respects, though, Mr. Struth's work remains within the tradition of "straight" photography. The values of precise observation -- the familiar world of people, trees, streets and buildings examined through a lens at a specific place and time -- are at the heart of his work. Despite efforts by some essayists in the catalog (Yale University Press) to bend him into a more tortured postmodern stance, he has said that he regards photography, rather quaintly, as a "communicative and analytical medium." 
But like his countryman Andreas Gursky, whose 2001 retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York was a popular smash, Mr. Struth also faces a degree of critical skepticism. Can an artist whose photographs are so clearly seductive be trusted? Are the places and people rendered in such detail and icy perfection more interesting and alive after scrutiny? Or has he embalmed them? Does the power of his images derive from thoughtful choices about what he has included or excluded from the frame? Or from the persuasive rhetoric of their sheer size?
The question of scale is front and center in Mr. Struth's celebrated photographs of museum and church interiors. Pictures about people looking at pictures, they capture the weariness and confusion of the art spectator, hoping for a private experience in a crowded public arena like the Pantheon or the Louvre. As tourists and students move through the Art Institute of Chicago or the Church of the Frari in Venice, pausing to read labels or just staring, Mr. Struth has pulled back and given us a cool but not unsympathetic large-format view of art in the age of mass travel. 
His photographs also destabilize the confident neutrality of anyone viewing them at an exhibition. Moments after studying the seriously dazed or slouching figures in Mr. Struth's pictures, visitors at the Met will no doubt be self-consciously checking their own attitudes and postures. These huge works will be shown in the Special Exhibitions gallery, while the Gilman gallery on the second floor will display his smaller prints.
Many of these pictures embody the deference -- and the envy -- that photography has traditionally shown toward painting. The people observed by Mr. Struth have come to museums to commune with artworks -- centuries old and weighty with religious or political themes -- that command attention and respect by their generous allotment of wall space. In their scale, Mr. Struth's photographs aspire to be compared with 19-century history paintings and other revered canvases and murals. At the same time, in their minute human imperfections -- figures whose movements are blurred by long time exposures -- his images also gently mock such pretensions. They are proud of what they are. 
Photography has long yearned for the opportunity to be big like its older brother. Carleton Watkins, Eadweard Muybridge and others who hauled their cameras across the 19th-century American west produced startlingly sharp contact prints with glass negatives as large as 18 by 22 inches. For maximum punch, it was standard practice in the 1860's and 70's to join photographs together in panoramas. A 21-panel view of a pagoda in India by the British photographer Linnaeus Tripe, dating from 1858 and now in the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal, measures 17 inches high by more than 19 feet long. 
A century later this was still the most popular method for those making photographs exceeding 20 by 24 inches -- the largest standard-size paper then commonly available. During the 1960's and 70's, many artists -- including Andy Warhol, Mel Bochner, Joyce Neimanas, Chuck Close, Sol LeWitt, Ray Metzker, Jan Groover, Lew Thomas and Brian Wood -- constructed large photographs out of smaller ones, the breaks between images integral to the meaning or rhythms of the whole. Mr. Avedon's murals were composites.
SEVERAL exhibitions in the United States during the 80's took notice of this new proclivity for supersize scale: "Big Pictures by Contemporary Photographers" at the Museum of Modern Art in 1983; "The Real Big Picture" at the Queens Museum in 1986; and "This Is Not a Photograph: 20 Years of Large-Scale Photography 1966-86" at the John and Mable Ringling Museum in Sarasota, Fla., in 1987. 
Mr. Struth was too young and obscure to be in these surveys. But his teachers, Bernd and Hilla Becher from the Dusseldorf Academy in Germany, have been recurring figures in them -- and ubiquitous throughout the last 20 years. Their systematic cataloging of water towers, factory chimneys and other relics of the industrial age, arranged neatly in black-and-white grids, have an almost sculptural presence on the wall. Mr. Struth's meticulous photographs of apartment complexes and deserted urban streets from the late 70's owe much to the Bechers. 
The checker-board grid was not for him, however, and over the last 15 years his photographs have expanded to suit his different and even grander pictorial appetite. His camera now swallows as much reality in one gulp as the Bechers do in 16 bites. The smooth unity of these giant single images allows him to maintain the illusion -- one of the pleasures of photography -- that the artist has interfered as little as possible between the world and the spectator. 
In a sense, Mr. Struth's photographs bridge a gulf that has persisted since the 70's between photographers and other artists. One of the motives for widening the dimensions of photographs was a desire to compete -- for economic and critical respect -- in galleries where painters and sculptors held sway. Thirty years ago, artists who wanted to burst the seams of the traditional black-and-white print were usually judged to be unsuitable -- too odd for exhibition in intimate print rooms. Likewise, photographers who played variations in a 35-millimeter format were dwarfed in SoHo lofts that had been used to hanging Abstract Expressionist or Pop Art. 
Mr. Struth, who lives in Dusseldorf, exhibits his work in New York at the Marian Goodman Gallery, a space designed for large-scale painting and sculpture. He has all the financial and art-historical support from the art world that anyone could want. His "Pantheon, Rome" sold at auction in 2000 for $270,000. Even so, as a photographer he is something of a 19th-century throwback. He does not digitize his 8-by-10-inch negatives, as Mr. Gursky does, nor is he preoccupied with narrative. Critical attempts to marry his art to Cindy Sherman's theatrical tableaus seem far-fetched. Cinematic scenarios and performance-art high jinks are absent in his deadpan descriptions. August Sander would have approved. 
But the success of the young Germans has provoked hordes of imitators who don't do big with the intelligent purpose of Mr. Struth or Mr. Gursky. The Armory Show in New York last fall was overstocked with gargantuan photographs of banal landscapes and domestic scenes, pictures with no evident reason for demanding that much space and attention. They existed to be big, as if that were enough. 
In photographs the size of a billboard almost everything looks more impressive. Big is dramatic. Big is thrilling. Big sells. It can also clarify detail and reveal relationships -- between objects in a picture and between the picture and the viewer -- that aren't apparent in an 8-by-10-inch print. 
Most photographers will tell you that scale is vitally important to them, although many dealers offer prints by their artists in more than one size for customers who prefer small or can't afford large versions. The British photographer Julian Opie is cavalier enough about the matter to have made work for sale in S, M, L and X-L. But more prevalent among dealers selling gigantic photographs is the trend of offering editions of an image, but in only one size, thus reinforcing a kinship with painting. Mr. Struth's pictures are marketed in this way. 
That photographers are no longer boxed in by the old standard sizes of manufacturer's papers in imagining work, or by the confines of print galleries in exhibiting it, can only be called a step forward. Technology offers new choices every year. A digital printer has come on the market that accepts 70-inch paper. Photographs on the scale of a Pollock will be an increasingly common sight. Extraordinary size made for extraordinary photographs in recent New York shows of works by Paul Shambroom at Julie Saul (of American town meetings) and Edward Burtynsky at Charles Cowles (of ships being broken up for scrap in Bangladesh). He currently has a show of oil fields in California and Canada at Cowles.
Still, it was refreshing this fall to see that Chuck Close, a pioneer of the supersize photograph and an artist for whom scale has been a binding issue throughout his long career, has been making daguerreotypes. Maybe small is the new big.

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
The Mother of an Era: August Wilson's

BYLINE:  By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN

 BODY:
ON a stifling July night in 1982, an aspiring playwright named August Wilson sat in the airless barn that served as the main stage for the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, Conn. Nearing 40, he had lately been earning his living as the staff cook for a social service agency in Minnesota. Beside him perched his mother, who had never seen any of his efforts at drama performed. This one was called "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom."
 A few rows away, Lloyd Richards gingerly settled into his customary chair. Though respected as the leader of both the O'Neill Center and the Yale Repertory Theater, he had gone almost a quarter-century since his zenith as a director -- with Lorraine Hansberry's "Raisin in the Sun." Portly and gray, he was deep enough into middle age to have bad hips. 
 Down beneath the stage, in what had been a livestock pen, several actors paced, scripts in hand. One was a former dry-cleaner, another a songwriter, the third a convicted killer who had entered the Yale Drama School while on parole. That young man, Charles S. Dutton, had been considering passing on the O'Neill because it paid only $25 a week, except that Mr. Richards had told him in an oracular way, "We might have something there for you." 
By the final blackout four hours later, American theater had changed forever. The point is not simply that the staged reading of "Ma Rainey" led to the acclaimed 1984 production that marked Mr. Wilson's Broadway debut. It is not that "Ma Rainey" announced Mr. Dutton to the theatergoing world and that it proclaimed Mr. Richards's re-emergence as a discoverer and shaper of dramatic talent. With the benefit of 20 years of hindsight, one can posit that the maiden performance of "Ma Rainey" inaugurated the August Wilson era. As both an individual playwright and a hub of theatrical activity, he has defined his time in the way Eugene O'Neill, Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, Neil Simon and Edward Albee defined the three preceding generations.
The revival of "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" that opens on Thursday at the Royale Theater -- starring Mr. Dutton and Whoopi Goldberg and directed by Marion McClinton -- invites retrospection. The production arrives with a modest advance, some public friction between stars and producers, and a sense of Mr. Wilson's career coming full circle. 
The playwright has already completed the ninth in his 10-play cycle about African-American life in the 20th century; that drama, "Gem of the Ocean," will have its premiere in April at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. An unrepentant black nationalist, a self-described "race man" who likens crossover artists to slaves amusing master, Mr. Wilson has managed simultaneously to ignore the mainstream and to stake his place in it. For its effect on American culture at large, Mr. Wilson's work finds its closest parallels not in theater but in music -- gospel, jazz, even hip-hop.
"There's a concept in theology called the 'scandal of particularity,' meaning when the universal God becomes a particular Jewish guy named Jesus," said Michael Eric Dyson, a prominent cultural critic who is a professor of African-American studies and religious studies at the University of Pennsylvania. "August Wilson's scandal of particularity is his unyielding attention to the specific details of black life. What it means for black identity to be assaulted, but also elevated. Assaulted by racial oppression, economic misery. But elevated because, in his plays, moral vision is not the property of the elite. There's ethical wisdom in the everyday struggles of black people. August Wilson has no desire to translate this for whites, to give a grammar of explanation or a thesaurus that might illumine. Just put black life there onstage and assume it exists. And yet by doing that, people can tap into it and it can resonate universally, because it dares to be particular."
Certainly, no playwright of Mr. Wilson's generation -- he is 57 -- has proved as ubiquitous. Every one of his first eight dramas has played in New York, seven of them on Broadway, and collectively they have received nearly 2,000 productions, from amateur companies to regional theaters to London's Royal National Theater. Mr. Wilson has won two Pulitzer Prizes ("Fences" in 1988 and "The Piano Lesson" in 1990), been a Pulitzer finalist four other times ("The Piano Lesson" in 1989, "Two Trains Running" in 1992, "Seven Guitars" in 1995 and "King Hedley II" in 2000), and taken seven New York Drama Critics Circle Awards (for all his plays except "King Hedley"). The search-engine Google makes 17,000 hits for "August Wilson": study guides, video clips, homework tips, discographies, selected quotations. The Library of Congress lists 30 books by or about Mr. Wilson. Doctoral dissertations on his plays ponder such topics as "strategies of coping with social oppression," "power acquisition theory and the tragic legacy," and "reforming the black male self."
The object of such postmodern rhetoric was born in the industrial reality of Pittsburgh in 1945. By now, the rudiments of Mr. Wilson's biography are widely known -- the son of a resilient, principled black mother and an abusive, absentee white father; the bright student driven into dropping out by bigoted teachers and classmates; the young poet inspired by the black arts movement in the 1960's; the nascent playwright who found his voice and subject only after leaving his black neighborhood, the Hill, for the vanilla climes of Minnesota.
Figuratively, and often literally, Mr. Wilson's plays have taken audiences to the Hill and the joys and torments of the black working class. Jitney drivers, preachers, railroad porters and boardinghouse landladies populate his stage. While slavery and its legacy hover over every Wilson drama, whites themselves rarely appear. His plays admit white viewers to a wholly contained black world of lunch-counter banter and bid-whist games, and reawaken blacks to the memories of thriving communal life before the mixed blessing of integration.
A strong strain of traditionalism runs through Mr. Wilson's art, and it helps explain the work's accessibility across racial lines. Even as Mr. Wilson's plays freely incorporate African-American art and ritual -- the ring shout in "Joe Turner's Come and Gone," the blues songs in "Ma Rainey," the totemic carvings in "The Piano Lesson" -- they embrace the now-unfashionable conventions of linear narrative and dramatic tension. 
In "The Piano Lesson," for instance, a brother and sister argue over the fate of a family heirloom. In "Fences," a young athlete's dream of a college scholarship collides with his father's bitter experience of the color barrier in sports. Observing at least some of the Aristotelian unities, "Ma Rainey" unfolds in 1927 in a single place (a Chicago recording studio) in actual time (a recording session). At the most elemental level, the drama involves a power struggle between the imperious Ma (Ms. Goldberg), the ambitious trumpeter Levee (Mr. Dutton) and the white recording company boss Sturdyvant (Louis Zorich). Ma is acutely aware that, whatever her stardom, she cannot hail a cab or be welcomed in a white home. What she can do is undermine Levee's own desire to stamp her sound with his jazzier style. From an almost godlike remove in the studio control booth, Sturdyvant both mediates and manipulates the friction.
"In a sense, the dramaturgy reaches back to Miller and O'Neill," said the playwright Tony Kushner, who won the Pulitzer Prize for "Angels in America." "August is impressively out of step with a lot of what's going on in the theater. And yet there's a way those plays are only apparently 'well-made.' The famous example is that 'Death of a Salesman' was originally called 'Inside His Head.' 'Iceman Cometh' is a sprawling thing. Like them, August's plays make huge demands. They're not just family dramas; they're deeply connected to a moment in history. And they aren't about escape or respite, but going down the mine shaft into the heart of things."
In his person, as well, Mr. Wilson has hewed to an old-fashioned path. He has lived for the last quarter century in two cities -- first, St. Paul, Minn., and now Seattle -- that are distant from entertainment capitals, and he has almost entirely refused to write for film or television. He has adapted only "The Piano Lesson," for a Hallmark Hall of Fame show in 1995. Only now, more than 15 years after it opened on Broadway, is "Fences," with Scott Rudin producing and Mr. McClinton directing, being developed for a film. In the meantime, said Mr. Wilson's lawyer and adviser, John Breglio, the playwright has turned down literally hundreds of screenwriting offers, including projects as formidable as Stephen Spielberg's "Amistad" and Spike Lee's "Malcolm X."
"I wanted to have a career in theater," Mr. Wilson said in a recent interview at that most traditional Broadway lunch spot, the Cafe Edison. "That's why I stayed true to it. It's a matter of concentration, of critical mass, instead of doing this, doing that. I haven't seen many black playwrights who stayed. What happened to Lonne Elder? What happened to Joseph Walker? Charles Fuller? They went to Hollywood. I wanted to hang around, to put together a body of work."
A combination of the right comrades and an evolution in theater economics gave Mr. Wilson the financial freedom to do so. Lloyd Richards, with his multiple directorial positions, was able to ensure staged readings at the O'Neill Center for Mr. Wilson's first three plays, followed by full productions at the Yale Repertory. By the fourth play, "The Piano Lesson," Mr. Richards and the Yale Rep's managing director, Ben Mordecai, had assembled a circuit of regional theaters -- particularly the Goodman in Chicago, the Seattle Rep, the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and the Huntington in Boston -- to present Mr. Wilson's work with the cast and director intact from the Yale premiere. The system allowed Mr. Richards and Mr. Wilson months to sharpen and burnish each play before coming to Broadway, and permitted the regional theaters to share in the risk or reward of the commercial production.
For theater professionals, this model represents possibly the most significant element of the Wilson era. "It's an extremely contemporary way of recreating the road," said Robert Marx, a former executive with both the National Endowment of the Arts and the New York Public Library of the Performing Arts. "When you think about the old days, with Miller and Odets and Williams and the rest, they developed their plays out of town. That system no longer exists. But with the process Lloyd and Ben created, you see nonprofit theaters come into their own as producing entities."
As commercial vehicles, Mr. Wilson's dramas have posted a mixed record. Three of the eight ("Fences," "The Piano Lesson" and "Jitney") turned a profit for investors, with "Fences" repaying original backers 10 times over, according to Mr. Mordecai. The Broadway runsranged from 72 performances for "King Hedley II" to 525 for "Fences."
For black actors and actresses, though, the plays have provided an unqualified bonanza. More than 250 African-American performers have played in the Broadway productions alone. And while the plays have occasionally benefited from the wattage of an established star -- Laurence Fishburne in "Two Trains Running," James Earl Jones in "Fences," Brian Stokes Mitchell in "King Hedley II" -- more often they have inaugurated or revived careers, including those of Courtney Vance and Mary Alice in "Fences" and Angela Bassett and Delroy Lindo in "Joe Turner's Come and Gone." Lloyd Richards had the luxury of replacing Samuel L. Jackson with Charles Dutton after the Yale production of "The Piano Lesson."
Mr. Dutton embodies the ultimate example of a career trajectory. His starring roles on Broadway in "Ma Rainey" and "The Piano Lesson" led to film roles and the television show "Roc," which draw heavily from the casts of "The Piano Lesson" and "Two Trains Running." Those endeavors, in turn, positioned him to move into directing, with the acclaimed HBO mini-series "The Corner."
"August's plays open doors," said Carl Gordon, who plays Ma Rainey's sideman Cutler and who also appeared in "The Piano Lesson." "Not just for more roles, but for challenging roles. You work with characters that have substance, that get you to stretch."
Mr. Dutton recalled the exhilaration of first reading the "Ma Rainey" script at the O'Neill. "We knew it was special," he said. "We heard these stories. We knew this dialect. It was so full of black folklore. I remember wondering if white folks were going to get it."
The success of Mr. Wilson's plays in reaching whites has not been without its ironies and controversies. The embrace of his work by regional theaters with largely white staffs and audiences has coincided with the demise of several of the most prominent black theaters, including Crossroads in New Brunswick, N.J., and the Negro Ensemble Company in Manhattan. In a speech to the Theater Communications Group in 1996, Mr. Wilson insisted on increased financing for black theater companies and disparaged color-blind casting as an "aberrant idea" meant to "deny us our own humanity, our own history." Robert Brustein, the theater critic of The New Republic and the man whom Lloyd Richards replaced as dean of the Yale School of Drama, answered the diatribe with one of his own, likening Mr. Wilson's vision of separate development to Southern segregation. "What next?" he wrote. "Separate schools? Separate washrooms? Separate drinking fountains?"
Playwright and critic met in a public debate at Town Hall in early 1997. And while neither convinced the other of anything, and many spectactors felt alienated by both, their exchange marked one of the few times in decades when a dispute born in the inward-facing realm of theater exploded into the larger world of ideas and politics.
Mr. Wilson had come to a different kind of parting from his mentor, Lloyd Richards. The playwright and Mr. Mordecai in 1995 formed a partnership called Sageworks, which has produced every Wilson play since "Seven Guitars." With "Jitney," they replaced Mr. Richards with Mr. McClinton, who had staged many of Mr. Wilson's dramas in nonprofit theaters. While Mr. Wilson and Mr. Richards have remained on civil terms since, speaking privately and appearing jointly at theater conferences, the ascension of surrogate son over surrogate father serves as one more way of marking the 20 years since "Ma Rainey" made its debut in the O'Neill Center's barn. 
This production is the first of Mr. Wilson's to reach Broadway without any road engagements to refine it and build word-of-mouth. It also depends more directly on stars than any show since "Fences" with James Earl Jones. Ms. Goldberg, who was appearing on Broadway in her own one-woman show when the original "Ma Rainey" was running, had long expressed interest in taking the title role in a revival. Last March, Mr. Wilson met with her and discovered that she had a seven-month block of time between films in early 2003. When it turned out that Mr. Dutton had the same period available, plans moved forward to raise the necessary $2.5 million. The project proved so attractive that two of the Broadway producers of the initial "Ma Rainey," Robert Cole and Frederick M. Zollo, claimed that they alone had the rights to a revival, and ultimately they were included with Sageworks and Ms. Goldberg among the investors.
Still, "Ma Rainey" had compiled an advance sale of only $500,000 by the time previews began in late January. (It has since grown to $875,000, comparable to the figure for the last two Wilson dramas on Broadway, "Seven Guitars" and "King Hedley II," Mr. Mordecai said.) Meanwhile, Mr. Dutton and Ms. Goldberg carped in a recent issue of Time Out magazine about the sort of matters -- accommodations for supporting actors, the order of their own names in title billing -- that are usually confined to backstage conversations or negotiated through agents rather than the media.
As of Thursday, critics and audiences will decide for themselves whether any of the brouhaha has affected the production onstage. Whatever his gripes to Time Out, Mr. Dutton also recognizes an obligation, both to the memory of the original and to the theatergoers who may have been in diapers or on training wheels when the August Wilson era began.
"I've had to get the original out of my system," Mr. Dutton said. "Because, I make no bones about it, for a long time my dream was to come back to Broadway with as many of the original folks -- director, actors, tech -- as are left. I had to let it go. I had to say the definitive production happened. It was August's discovery, my discovery, Lloyd's re-emergence. It had all those great circumstances. But that's not to disparage this one. Realizing now that there's a new generation of audience members who've never seen 'Ma Rainey,' I'm very hyped up. There's a sense of history. I want them to understand what the big deal was all about."

The Plays and the Cycle
EVERY one of August Wilson's plays exists not only as a separate work but as part of a cycle of 10 dramas about African-American life in 20th-century America. Each is set in a specific decade, and all except "Ma Rainey" take place in the playwright's home neighborhood, known as the Hill, in Pittsburgh. At this point, only one play remains to be written, covering the 1990's. Here are the rest in chronological order.

GEM OF THE OCEAN (1904) Former slaves and men born into freedom meet in the parlor of Aunt Ester, a central figure in the neighborhood.

JOE TURNER'S COME AND GONE (1911) Finally released from the bondage of a bounty hunter, a man named Herald Loomis turns up in a boardinghouse looking for his missing wife.

MA RAINEY'S BLACK BOTTOM (1927) In a recording studio, the blues diva and her most gifted musician strain against the racial caste system and one another.

THE PIANO LESSON (1936) A brother and sister battle over whether to keep or sell a piano that represents their tortured family history.

SEVEN GUITARS (1948) A bluesmusician's unexpected hit song alters the lives of his sidemen, friends and lover.

FENCES (1957) Father and son battle, literally and otherwise, over the prospect of an athletic scholarship for the boy.

TWO TRAINS RUNNING (1969) Amid the regulars at a neighborhood lunch counter, a newly released convict tries to reassemble his life.

JITNEY (1977) In the dingy office of a gypsy cab company, the owner and his ex-con son clash over their tormented relationship.

KING HEDLEY II (1985) Returning after seven years in prison to a neighborhood devastated by Reaganomics, the title character tries to re-establish himself, largely by crime, and understand his past.

'Don't Call Us' Is Becoming the Headhunters' Mantra

BYLINE:  By MELINDA LIGOS 

 BODY:
ABOUT two years ago, when he was an associate at a big public relations firm in Manhattan, Timothy Seitz said that he got two or three calls a week from executive recruiters trying to woo him away. Nowadays, he says, most of those same recruiters won't even return his calls.
 "Unless you're at the top of your field, headhunters want nothing to do with you," said Mr. Seitz, 32, of Brooklyn, who had been looking for a position for more than a year. 
 With fewer spots to fill in a tight job market, recruiters across nearly all industries, even growth markets like pharmaceuticals and health care, report that they are sharply narrowing their candidate pools. 
In the late 1990's, when the economy was stronger, recruiters "couldn't find people for jobs fast enough," said Arnold Huberman, president of Arnold Huberman Associates, a recruiting firm based in New York that specializes in the public relations field. "Now it appears that almost nobody is good enough for our clients."
Mr. Huberman says he is often only able to place candidates with impeccable credentials. Job seekers who have been laid off, or have worked at a dot-com "have black marks on their foreheads and are virtually ignored by recruiters right now," he said.
The same holds true in the legal profession, where the more lucrative jobs in many big cities are typically filled by recruiters. Dominic Morandi, a recruiter with Schneider Legal Search in Manhattan, said his firm had sharply narrowed its cold-calling lists to include only those lawyers who work at the city's top firms.
A few years ago, when there was a seemingly endless stream of corporate work for lawyers because of a high level of merger activity, Mr. Morandi said, some clients were "willing to drop their standards" by considering, for example, lawyers who went to law schools not in the Ivy League. Today, he said, candidates who did not graduate from top schools in the top 10 percent of their classes are going to have a harder time attracting recruiters' attention.
Another legal recruiter based in San Francisco, who insisted that he not be identified, agreed. "Three years ago, we had an A list, a B list and a C list" of potential candidates, he said. "We called everybody on all of those lists. Now, if you're not on the A list, we can't waste our time with you."
So who's on the A list? "If you were summa cum laude at Harvard Law and work for a top firm, you'll probably make the cut," he said.
What then can a job seeker without such credentials do? There are ways to gain a recruiter's attention even in a tight market. The trick, many of them say, is to be persistent, to try to stand out and to remain flexible. (If all else fails, you may have to do it yourself, they acknowledge.)
Gary Miller, president of the Oak Brook, Ill., branch of Management Recruiters International, which places candidates in the consumer goods and health care fields, among other industries, recommends taking a personalized approach. He suggests approaching three or four recruiting firms that specialize in the field you work in. "It's better to try to get a few recruiters to know you well than solicit yourself to dozens," said Mr. Miller, who says he receives hundreds of computer-generated resumes and cover letters each week.
Candidates should also treat an interview with a recruiter with as much importance as a real job interview, right down to their dress and the questions they ask, said Audrey Smith, a senior vice president at Development Dimensions International in Bridgeville, Pa., which helps Fortune 500 companies develop criteria for executives. 
"You've got to show the recruiter that you're serious about a position, and not just going on a fishing expedition," she said. 
Mr. Miller of Management Recruiters International says candidates should not be rigid in their salary requirements. "I'm more interested in candidates who are less worried about compensation and more interested in a great opportunity," he said.
And while credentials often carry the day in the legal field, Mr. Morandi of Schneider Legal Search suggests that job seekers can attract a recruiter's attention if they have established themselves as an expert in their field. "There are people who slip in the door because their skills are known," he said. "Maybe they're well known as regular speakers in continuing-education courses, or they've worked on a high-profile bankruptcy deal." 
Other experts recommend that job seekers try to leave a memorable impression. When Deborah Brown-Volkman, 37, was looking for a marketing position in the last economic downturn in the early 1990's, she said she sentseveral recruiters a copy of her resume, along with a red pen and a return envelope, asking them to critique it. Ms. Brown-Volkman, now a career coach in Long Beach, N.Y., said she received dozens of replies, and ultimately a new position.
She now counsels job seekers to send portfolios to recruiters highlighting the work they have done. She also recommends that they do not spend much time on headhunters who do not return their phone calls. "The truth is that recruiters won't call you back unless they have a job for you," she said. "You can't take it personally -- you've just got to move on." 
Mr. Seitz, the public relations executive, did just that, only without the help of a recruiter. In early January, he saw a help-wanted ad for a senior account executive position at a boutique public relations firm with an office in Manhattan. He decided to send its hiring manager a news release highlighting his achievements, including a description of how he had created an internal course for employees at his previous firm on how to build better media lists. He also included testimonials from past clients. 
Within a few days, Mr. Seitz said, he received a call from the company's president applauding his creativity. He started his job on Jan. 22.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Online Calculator Computes Incentives; 
Figuring Rents For Downtown

 BODY:
Companies trying to decide whether to remain in or relocate to lower Manhattan have two new online tools -- a space finder and a calculator that computes the savings from the government incentives they would receive to move or stay downtown. 
 "We're hoping the tools will increase the number of companies leasing space downtown," said Shirley Jaffe, vice president of economic development at the Downtown Alliance, which created the incentive calculator and space finder. They are available on the alliance's Web site, www.DowntownNY.com. 
 The calculator allows firms to list such things as the number of workers, the desired rent range and their corporate tax rate. They must specify if on 9/11 they were in or out of the zone designated for certain types of grant eligibility, bounded by Chambers and Rector Streets, Broadway and the Hudson River. 
Ms. Jaffe gave as an example a 50-employee company seeking 12,500 square feet for five years at an annual rent of $27 a square foot. If that company moved from outside to inside the downtown restricted area it would get government incentives totaling $579,451 over the term of the lease, an annual savings of $11.11 a square foot. If it is already inside the restricted area and remains, the incentive totals $645,418, or $12.31 a square foot.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME; 
Tax Rules On the Sale Of a Home

BYLINE:  By JAY ROMANO 

 BODY:
LATE last year, the Internal Revenue Service issued regulations aimed at clarifying a 1997 law that allows taxpayers to exclude up to $500,000 in gain from the sale of a principal residence.
 One set of regulations, made final on Dec. 24, 2002, addresses a number of issues that were somewhat unclear in the original law. Among these topics are how to determine if a home is a principal residence; when and how to allocate the gain between residential and business use of the property; how to apply the exclusion to joint owners who are not married; and how to fulfill the requirement that the owner use the home as a principal residence for two of the five years before the sale. 
 Another set of regulations, published on Dec. 24 but designated as temporary, identifies when a home that has been used as a principal residence for less than two years may qualify for a reduced exclusion of gain.
"People sometimes need help reading and applying a statute," said Joel E. Miller, a Queens tax lawyer. "And these regulations serve that purpose." 
Mr. Miller said that while neither set of regulations substantively changes the original 1997 law, they do reflect an I.R.S. interpretation of that law that seems favorable to taxpayers.
Gary H. Schatsky, a Manhattan lawyer and financial consultant, said that before 1997, homeowners could defer paying tax on the gain resulting from the sale of their principal residence if, within two years of the sale, they purchased a new home for an equal or greater amount than the sale price of the old one. In addition, Mr. Schatsky said, the tax laws at the time allowed a once-in-a-lifetime exclusion of up to $125,000 in gains for homeowners who were 55 and older when they sold their home.
The 1997 law was more generous to homeowners. It allows an individual taxpayer who owns and lives in a home for two out of the last five years to completely avoid paying taxes on up to $250,000 in gains and, in fact, to repeat the process every two years. Married taxpayers filing jointly, Mr. Schatsky said, can exclude up to $500,000 in gain.
"It was an extraordinary boon for people who have enjoyed significant increases in their property values," he said. "But the law left some questions unanswered."
For example, the 1997 law provided that a homeowner who did not meet the two-year requirement might be eligible for a partial exclusion if the homeowner had to sell the house because of health reasons, a change in the place of employment or, to the extent provided by I.R.S. regulations, "unforeseen circumstances." In other words, he said, the law left it up to the I.R.S to determine what would be considered an unforeseen circumstance.
Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., said that with the temporary regulations, the I.R.S. had identified various "safe harbors" that will automatically qualify a sale for a reduced exclusion.
For example, he said, taxpayers who sell their homes because their place of work has changed will automatically qualify for a reduced exclusion if a "qualified person's" new place of work is at least 50 miles farther from the old home than the old workplace was. A qualified person, Mr. Block said, includes the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, a co-owner of the home or a member of the taxpayer's household. 
The reduced exclusion, he said, is based upon the length of time the taxpayer owned and lived in the home before selling it. For example, a taxpayer who would be entitled to a $250,000 tax exclusion if he sold the home after two years will be entitled to a $125,000 exclusion if he sells it after one year and meets the requirements for the reduced exclusion.
In addition, Mr. Block said, the I.R.S. has said that a sale made for health reasons is eligible for a reduced exclusion if a qualified person -- which includes close relatives -- has a disease, illness or injury. "If a physician recommends the change in residence, that will be enough to satisfy the I.R.S.," he said.
Finally, Mr. Block said, the I.R.S. has articulated what it considers to be "unforeseen circumstances" for purposes of qualifying for the partial exclusion. Such events include death, divorce or legal separation; becoming eligible for unemployment compensation; a change in employment that leaves the taxpayer unable to pay the mortgage or reasonable basic living expenses; and multiple births resulting from the same pregnancy. Such events, he said, must involve the taxpayer, a spouse, a co-owner or a member of the taxpayer's household. 
Other unforeseen circumstances include damage to the residence resulting from a disaster caused either by nature or by humans, an act of war or terrorism or the condemnation, seizure or other involuntary loss of the property.
"And the regulations also give the director of the I.R.S. the discretion to identify other circumstances as unforeseen," Mr. Block said.
Mr. Miller, the Queens tax lawyer, said a taxpayer who has already filed a return reporting a gain from the sale of a principal residence but now realizes he or she qualifies for an exclusion can obtain the benefits of the exclusion by filing an amended return. In most cases, he said, returns can be amended for up to three years after the original due date. 
In the recently published final regulations, Mr. Miller added, the I.R.S. addressed several issues that needed clarification.
For example, he said, for taxpayers with more than one home, relevant factors for determining which is the principal residence include the amount of time a home is used; the taxpayer's place of employment; the residence of other family members; the address used for tax returns, driver's license, car registration, voter registration and bills and correspondence; and the location of the taxpayer's banks, religious organizations and recreational clubs.
The final regulations also allow the home sale exclusion when the gain includes the sale of vacant land that has been used as part of the residence (provided the land sale occurs within two years of the sale of the residence) and indicate that a co-owner who files an individual return is entitled to an exclusion of up to $250,000, provided the other requirements of the law are met.
The regulations also explain how the two-year personal use and ownership time periods are calculated. For example, Mr. Miller said, the two-year ownership and use periods need not be concurrent. That means that someone who lives in a home for two years before buying it and who then moves out of the home after buying it but does not sell for it another two years will have met the requirements of the law.
And the two-year period itself, he said, can consist of 24 consecutive months, 730 individual days or any other variation equaling two years, provided that the two years of residence occurs within the five years before the sale. Short absences like vacations, he said, would count as periods of use while longer absences -- such as a one-year sabbatical -- would not.
Finally, Mr. Miller said, the I.R.S. has relaxed the rules on business use of the home. He explained that whenever a taxpayer uses a portion of a home exclusively for business purposes and takes a tax deduction for that use, the cost basis of that portion of the house is reduced by the amount of the depreciation deduction allowed or allowable.
Under the former rules for excluding gain on the sale of a house, whenever a home office was involved, the taxpayer would basically report two separate sales: one for the residential portion of the house and the other for the business portion. And while the gain on the residential portion might qualify for the exclusion, the gain on the business portion would not.
Under the final regulations, however, if the business use of the home occurred within the same dwelling unit as the residential use, the taxpayer does not need to allocate the gain between the business and residential use. 
And while in most cases a taxpayer who realizes a gain will be subject to tax on any depreciation deductions taken on the business portion of the home after May 6, 1997, he or she will be entitled to exclude any amount above that up to the maximum allowable exclusion.

Upscale Rentals to Open in Downtrodden Camden

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
FOUR years of planning and effort are coming together now in Camden, the state's poorest city, where work is under way on the historic RCA Victor building to transform it into 341 upscale loft apartments.
 The wind whipping off the Delaware River, where the huge brick structure occupies a square block at Market and Delaware Streets, may seem icy enough to freeze motion. Yet throughout the dead of winter, work has proceeded at "120 miles an hour," said the project's developer, Carl Dranoff. 
 Financing through Fleet Bank fell into place last October, and Dranoff Properties took title to the property and immediately began "coring" the building -- removing concrete and steel at the center of the structure to create a 60-by-300-foot space for an atrium courtyard. Right now, 1,100 windows on the exterior and courtyard walls of the building -- some 14 feet tall, some wood and some steel -- are being removed and replaced with historically correct new ones, Mr. Dranoff said. 
The building, vacant for 11 years, was put on the National Register of Historic Places last summer, he said, and must be restored accordingly. It is six stories tall, with a tower rising four more stories.
A grand opening of the refurbished building and model apartments is planned for Memorial Day. Also on display that day will be other new construction in Camden's waterfront area, including research-and-development buildings being built for Drexel and Rutgers University researchers, which will feature space for start-up "incubator" businesses. Another building nearing completion will house L-3 Communications, a manufacturer of military and commercial communications equipment. 
Mr. Dranoff said he expected the transformed Camden waterfront to come off as an "overnight sensation." He added, "Of course, that's supreme irony, given all that has gone into the revival of Camden."
Mr. Dranoff's company, Dranoff Properties, is based just across the Delaware, in Philadelphia -- where he renovated a hulking old industrial building into upscale apartments five years ago, using many of the techniques now being employed at the Victor, as the building has been renamed.
But Mr. Dranoff said he had never participated in anything comparable to the far-reaching, concerted effort to revive the crumbled city of Camden.
Members of the South Jersey delegation to the State Legislature developed the idea over the last five years of making Camden a real "university city." Rutgers has both a university campus and a law school near the central business district. There are also two teaching hospitals in Camden: Cooper and Our Lady of Lourdes.
Last summer, Gov. James E. McGreevey announced the state would invest $175 million over the next three years to demolish abandoned houses, rehabilitate deteriorated housing, build business space, improve public safety and resurrect the economy in Camden. The state also took over administration of city government, which has been chronically problem-ridden, with three mayors indicted in the last 10 years.
The state financing is being drawn from an array of state agencies, including the Casino Reinvestment Authority, Community Affairs Department, Environmental Protection Department, Transit Authority, Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency and the State Police.
The funding for the Victor is also a patchwork, with New Jersey's largest bank, Fleet, having structured the overall financing for the $58 million project. 
Philip G. Grossman, a senior vice president with Fleet, which has more than 500 branches in the state, said. "We are providing $30 million in partnership with two smaller banks, Wilmington Trust Company and United Bank of Philadelphia," he said, "and Fleet is administering nearly $9 million from the Casino Redevelopment Authority."
Creda, as it is known, reinvests money that the state takes in from casino taxes to further projects deemed to be "smart growth" efforts. About $5 million from Creda was used for environmental cleanup at the building, which was polluted by chemicals used in manufacturing cabinetry for Victrolas, and later radios and televisions.
In addition, Fleet assembled $11 million in equity financing from Related Capital of New York and Dranoff. Another $8 million in cut-rate financing came from the Delaware River Port Authority, Mr. Grossman added.
Fleet is committed to supporting low- and moderate-income housing, he said, and "Camden needed concentrated effort in order to bring people over from Philadelphia, for jobs and affordable housing."
The Victor will be the first housing ever on the waterfront, and it will be the costliest in Camden, but still a bargain for Philadephians, Mr. Grossman said. Mr. Dranoff said apartment rents would be $775 to $1,050 for studios, $975 to $1,400 for one-bedroom units, $1,650 to $2,100 for two bedrooms, $2,500 to $2,550 for three bedrooms and $2,550 to $2,650 for penthouses and duplexes.
The building will be replete with amenities: a lobby finished in slate, marble and rich woods that opens to the atrium courtyard; a 24-hour uniformed concierge; three conference rooms and a theater for use by residents; and a fitness center, installed on three levels of the building's landmark "Nipper" tower, with 360 degree views. The square tower is so named because of four stained-glass windows near the top, depicting the dog on the RCA logo, Nipper, listening to a Victrola -- an image created by the English painter Francis Barraud.
The entrance to the Victor apartments will be on Market Street next to the tower, at the same entry point used by RCA employees for more than 80 years.
Residents of the Victor will only have to walk across Delaware Street to hop onto an aerial tram to Philadelphia. The tram, financed with $8 million in federal transportation money, is scheduled to be built over the next two years and to begin service by the spring of 2005. A light rail system providing a direct connection to Trenton and quick access to New York City, with a station next to The Victor, is set to open this spring. There is also ferry service to Philadelphia.
The New Jersey State Aquarium, the South Jersey Performing Arts Center, the battleship New Jersey and its new museum, and Campbell's Field where the Riversharks baseball team plays, are all within three blocks of the Victor.
"We did the market analysis of this area, and this project," Mr. Grossman noted, "and we are underwriting it based on a superb plan for a historic building that will provide very high-quality housing units."
Because the building is receiving federal tax credits related to its historic status,rules require that it remain rental units for five years. After that, both Mr. Dranoff and Mr. Grossman said, it is likely to become a candidate for conversion to condominiums.
"We are putting in all the amenities you could ever want in a condo," Mr. Dranoff said, "and we expect the building to be supersuccessful as rentals or condos."
He went on: "I'm telling you, Camden is happening. It's not going to be the poorest city 10 years from now. Our property, which was once the symbol of blight, will be the symbol of a remarkable revival. How could it fail, with all the energy and creativity -- and cash -- flowing into it?"

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
< HDL>Openings For Growth In European Equities

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
ONE of these years, investing in Europe is going to pay off.
 For most people, it certainly didn't last year. Only a handful of mutual funds that invest in European stocks posted positive returns. Over the last three years, the average European equity fund has fallen by just over 16 percent, according to Lipper. 
 Jason T. Holzer, senior portfolio manager of the $375 million AIM European growth fund, talked last week about Europe's prospects. Here are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. Why invest in European stocks?

A. Europe is selling at about a 35 percent discount on price to cash earnings relative to the Standard & Poor's 500 index. That is close to a 25-year low. Europe's price to book value is at about 1.6 times, which is close to a 10-year low. And the dividend yield is 3.6 percent.

Q. Aren't European economies weak?

A. People continuously bring up the same negatives about Europe -- the European central bank is less proactive, labor is inflexible in terms of its mobility and Germany is very much sputtering. But, in fact, Europe has some key structural advantages relative to the United States. First, Europe doesn't have a current account deficit, as the United States does. The U.S. deficit requires foreign investment. To this point, foreign investors have been happy to do that.
Second, Europe doesn't have the same level of overcapacity as the U.S. Savings rates are higher, and consumer debt levels are lower. In Europe, consumer debt is 46 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 82 percent in the United States.
Finally, in Europe there is generally a lower level of equity ownership.

Q. Why haven't more Europeans bought stocks?

A. With the bursting of the technology and equity bubble more generally, a lot of first-time investors that came in have pulled out. That has kind of retarded the development of the equity culture.

Q. Why were the markets down in January?

A. A lot of the softness since the start of the year has to do with general uncertainty about economic prospects, the situation in Iraq and forced selling of stock by insurance companies. In the United Kingdom some insurance companies have been selling stock in order to avoid insolvency problems. One of the problems Europe had in the 1990's was that strong returns on equities disguised the fact that insurance companies were not making money underwriting policies.
But the flip side of the weakness is opportunity, and we are finding a tremendous number of reasonably priced growth stocks in a wide range of countries.

Q. Which markets do you like, and why?

A. Peripheral markets like Ireland and Spain are among our larger weights in Europe. The economies in both countries are growing at close to 3 percent. And our biggest weight is in the United Kingdom, which last year had decent economic growth of more than 2 percent. We are underweight in France, as well as Holland and Switzerland.

Q. Which stocks in these markets are you particularly excited about?

A. The largest holding in our European fund is Anglo Irish Bank, an Irish-based company. This is a stock with a $2 billion market cap that has been the fastest-growing bank in Europe over the last five years, with a compound growth rate of more than 30 percent. It focuses on lending to small and medium-size businesses. And they have successfully exported their model from Ireland to Britain. This is a bank that has over 30 percent return on equity yet sells at barely over 10 times 2003 earnings.
We like a number of companies in Spain, including Mapfre, an insurance company with leading positions in life and nonlife insurance. Inditex, a world-class retailer whose best known format is Zara, is another Spanish company we like. It is probably the fastest growing large retailer in the world. They have a few stores in Canada, the United States, Britain and throughout Europe.
One company we like in Britain is Imperial Tobacco. It sells at about 10 times earnings with a dividend yield of more than 4 percent. It has no U.S. exposure, and thus has no litigation risk. It is a very solidly run company that is extracting a lot of cost savings from an acquisition they made in Germany. The company has an A.D.R. that trades in this country.

Q. Do any sectors look attractive?

A. We have increased our exposure in telecom. It is more attractive to us because companies have hunkered down and are focusing on cash flow and reducing capital expenditures. And the pharmaceutical area looks pretty interesting.
One smaller drug company we like is Stada, a German generic drug company. It should be a great beneficiary of a the nascent but much less developed generic drug market in Europe than we see in the States.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2003 Honda Accord; 
Further Dividends From Honda's Midsize Investments

BYLINE:  By PETER PASSELL 

DATELINE: OJAI, Calif. 

 BODY:
IN the 1980's, before Americans discovered the joys of commuting in vehicles designed for safaris, the family sedan was king of the road. Chevy and Ford vied with pretenders from Japan. Near the end of each model year, automakers mounted last-ditch efforts to win the crown that went to the nation's best-selling car.
 Detroit no longer has its heart, or its wallet, in this race: its automaking profits come mostly from trucks and truck-based S.U.V.'s. But the Japanese (as well as the Germans and Koreans) still invest heavily in midsize, midprice cars, and the market is crowded with classy models at fair prices. The latest, and one of the greatest, is the seventh-generation Honda Accord. 
 The Accord has always been near the top of the pack, offering comfort, polish and reliability on a par with the market-defining Toyota Camry, while generally beating the Camry in power and handling. The competition has become a lot tougher in the last year or two, with the arrival of a handsome, sporty Nissan Altima; better-built midsize sedans from Hyundai and Kia; and, most recently, a new Mazda, the 6, to replace the aging 626. Is Honda up to the challenge?
Better you should ask whether Placido Domingo can carry a tune.
The 2003 Accord comes as four-door sedan or two-door coupe, with four- or six-cylinder aluminum engines and five-speed manual or automatic transmissions. The coupe is also sold with a six-speed manual borrowed from the Acura 3.2CL Type-S.
Both new Accords look more aggressive than previous models, with broad haunches and a sharply sloping hood, along with head-turning headlight treatments. My guess is that this hint of Dr. Jekyll in a car that has defined buttoned-down civility will irritate as many potential buyers as it charms. But on every other score, there's no denying that the 2003 model is a big step up.
The smaller of the two engines, a 2.4-liter in-line four, generates 160 horsepower -- a notable 10 more than the last-generation engine. The 3-liter V-6 pumps out a remarkable 240 horses, up 20 percent. Yet with the extra gear in the automatic transmissions, both engines get better mileage than their predecessors. Indeed, the four-cylinder with an automatic, which will almost certainly be the best-selling combination, is rated at 24 m.p.g. in town and 33 on the highway. Thanks in large part to its fancy electronics, this engine also meets California's super-ultra-low emissions standard, called Sulev.
To complement the new muscle, Honda modified the suspension and steering to accommodate more aggressive driving. The tires are bigger and designed for more demanding use. Models that came with 14- and 15-inch wheels have been bumped up to 15 and 16 inches, and the V-6 with the six-speed gearbox flaunts 17-inch wheels with 215/50R17 low-profile tires. Antilock brakes are standard -- at last! -- on every version.
All the Accords that have four-wheel disc brakes -- that is, all the six-cylinder models, plus the fancy EX four-cylinder -- also come with electronic brake distribution. This technology increases braking efficiency by adjusting the braking force between front and rear according to the distribution of passengers and cargo.
Inside, the new Accord is Honda-practical with touches of eye candy.
The driver's seat is more supportive -- indeed, according to my aching back, it is about as good as car seating gets. The steering wheel now telescopes as well as tilts -- very handy and somewhat unusual in an era of cost-cutting designs. Side air bags are available on all models, and the high-end V-6 has side-curtain bags for head protection.
While the outside dimensions are virtually unchanged, the interior has been reworked to provide more storage for maps, CD's and Twinkies, as well as marginally more passenger room. The bigger change is psychological: the cabin seems more airy, and the materials never feel flimsy or cheap. Aside from the first-class front seats, the rear can handle three adults in economy-class comfort.
As one expects from Honda, the controls earn high marks for aesthetics and ease of use. The buttons are generally large and well placed. Visibility, front and rear, is excellent.
What may not be expected is the bit of flash. The instrument panel, with its L.E.D. meters and backlit "floating" needles, reminded me of a Lexus. The keyless locking system, standard on all but the basic DX model, can be used to open and close all four windows.
Those springing for the EX V-6, starting around $26,000, get frills that push the car into luxury territory: heated leather seats with power controls for both driver and passenger, two-zone climate controls; and a monster stereo with six-disk changer. A DVD-based navigation system with voice recognition (adapted from I.B.M.'s ViaVoice software) is an option on the EX.
I spent a day sampling the whole Accord line on mountain roads above Malibu, and later used a four-cylinder EX automatic to commute and run errands for a week. The V-6 with manual transmission is loads of fun -- a true driver's car. But the real bargain is the combination of four-cylinder engine and five-speed manual gearbox; with optional air-conditioning, that car is around $17,000. The engine is rated at just 160 horsepower, but it felt like more. The Honda stick shift is about as quick and precise as they come, and the steering has just enough road feel.
The four-cylinder automatic that I took home provided a less rousing experience. While creamy-smooth, the transmission bleeds off a bit of power and takes the edge off the sense of control imparted by the stick shift. Moreover, the sheer understated competence of the car can make getting from here to there a forgettableexperience. By every objective standard, however, this is a very satisfying people mover.
It corners very well -- far better than the previous Accord -- with minimal body roll on hard turns. And like all well-designed front-drive cars, the Accord gives ample warning before it reaches the limits of traction. The suspension is unflappable on rough pavement, giving the Accord the feel of a bigger car. Interior noise is exceptionally low for a midprice sedan. The quiet -- along with the great front seats -- probably explains why hours on the freeway generated almost no fatigue.
No car, it is safe to say, is going to dominate a market segment this competitive. I am smitten by the style of the Nissan Altima, and undoubtedly vast numbers of drivers will remain loyal to the Camry, with its great reliability and high resale value. By the same token, the Volkswagen Passat and the new Mazda6 are winners with drivers who put a premium on handling.
In short, the only reason not to buy a new Accord is the proliferation of worthy competition. This is a remarkable moment to be shopping for a midsize sedan. Too bad so many Americans insist on driving vehicles that are more at home fording the headwaters of the Zambesi than changing lanes on Interstate 5.

INSIDE TRACK: A wealth of practical riches.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The 2003 Accord coupe, above, and sedan do not look much alike, and indeed they share few visible exterior pieces. In both versions, the controls and instruments show Honda's attention to detail.

HEADLINE: Investing; 
Betting on the Gulf War? Try Securities in Israel

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

 BODY:
AMERICANS have had to factor terrorism and the prospect of war into their investment decisions for more than a year, but Israelis have been doing it for decades. Being near a center of continual conflict has taught them to shrug off events that would alarm investors anywhere else.
 Still, the prospect of another Persian Gulf war, and months of suicide bombings, are among the reasons Israeli stocks have fallen about 25 percent in the last year. 
 "Political events in Israel are so much the norm that the market has learned not to react to them," said Jonathan Half, an analyst for UBS Warburg in Tel Aviv. "But major political events, where there is a change in direction in the geopolitical situation, will have an impact." 
Until the standoff in the gulf is settled, UBS prefers to limit its exposure to Israeli stocks, which fell 0.4 percent last week, after the election that kept Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his Likud Party in power. "The market in Israel will react positively to a short, limited war and a solution to the problem," Mr. Half said.
Americans wishing to take advantage of any recovery in Israeli stocks have ample means to do so. The closed-end First Israel fund and five Israeli companies trade on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 70 Israeli companies trade on Nasdaq. A mutual fund called the Blue and White fund is raising money from investors and is expected to begin operations shortly. It aims to put 75 percent of its portfolio into Israeli stocks that are listed in America.
Beyond the immediate trouble involving Iraq, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has produced a chronic drag on the economy, with no end in sight. 
Stanley Nabi, managing director for value investments at Credit Suisse Asset Management, the company that runs the First Israel fund, said that an end to the Iraq crisis may provide only fleeting relief to Israel. The stock market "will go up temporarily," he predicted, "but any resolution with Iraq is not going to resolve the Palestinian conflict."
Israeli stocks have also been hurt by the global slowdown in technology spending. "Israel is a country that relies on exporting technology, and that has weakened considerably," Mr. Nabi said. 
On the other hand, Shlomo Eplboim, the chairman of Eplboim, Poutre & Company, an investment management firm in Los Angeles that is a founder of the Blue and White fund, said that Israeli exporters benefit from the persistent decline in the value of the country's currency, the shekel, which makes their products cheaper for foreign buyers. 
One company with a large following abroad is Check Point Software Technologies, which provides Internet security. Mr. Eplboim likes Check Point but said he would wait until the stock falls to $10 before buying; it closed on Friday at $14.33. Check Point has a lot of cash on its balance sheet and ought to benefit from "a huge catch-up in upgrades of security software" when technology spending revives, he said.
Mr. Half said that Warburg was "not that positive on technology." Nevertheless, Israel has many "higher-quality, profitable companies in the sector," including Check Point, he said, which is "considered almost the primary supplier of firewalls used by corporates to secure their networks."
Other Israeli stocks recommended by Warburg include Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, one of the world's largest makers of generic drugs, and the DSP Group, "a world leader in developing and selling semiconductors used in cordless phones," Mr. Half said.
Mr. Eplboim also said that he likes Teva but recommended buying it on a dip below $30. He said he would buy Taro Pharmaceutical Industries, a producer of dermatology medications , at the same price. It closed on Friday at $35.15.
Other stocks he would consider buying include Elron Electronic Industries, a holding company for technology businesses, and two banks, Bank Leumi and Bank Hapoalim.
All of the stocks mentioned trade on Nasdaq, except the two banks, which trade on the over-the-counter market for smaller or less active stocks.
The country's strength in technology reflects its security needs, as well as a highly educated work force that is continuously replenished by the immigration of scientists, engineers and other skilled workers, including many from the former Soviet states. Israel also devotes considerable resources to education and provides hefty tax breaks for corporate research.
Mr. Eplboim explained that inventors who develop products for the military are typically permitted to profit from civilian applications. The government's attitude, he said, is that "because they are spending so much on the military, they might as well make it into a business."

Re "7 Families Sue Administrator of 9/11 Fund" (news article, Jan. 27):
 My father (lost on 9/11) would be mortified to know that people are taking Kenneth R. Feinberg to court. 
 Using the federal fund intended to compensate relatives of victims is optional. You can go with it or sue the airlines. The Cantor Fitzgerald suit is a purely opportunistic action, and it's embarrassing to those of us who are glad for an alternative (albeit imperfect) to a suit. 
Yes, the loss of a wage earner will require people to give up things in their lives as a result of the financial change. It happens to families every day. I am concerned to hear that "the families" are demanding one thing and the next; I can imagine what our neighbors -- so generous with their donations after the attack, and many hit hard by this ailing economy -- are thinking.
Of course no one wants to be heard criticizing the 9/11 families, and I think that's what Cantor's attorneys are betting on.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Theodore T. Southworth; 
Northern Income Equity Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
THESE have been trying times for buyers of convertible securities, says Theodore T. Southworth, who runs the $204 million Northern Income Equity fund.
 Ideally, convertibles -- bonds or preferred shares that can be converted to common shares at a predetermined exchange rate -- will account for all of the fund's holdings, he said. But he has reduced that proportion to only 76 percent because few convertibles have been issued recently and there are fewer good buys available, he said. At the moment, stocks account for 10 percent of the fund's holdings, and cash represents 14 percent. 
 He said that he believed that the supply of convertibles would remain tight because financial markets are still unsettled. "Companies haven't yet reached the point where they're looking for money for general corporate purposes," he said.
The fund lost 0.5 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with a 5.2 percent loss for all convertible bond funds, according to Morningstar. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell at an annual rate of 13.5 percent in that period.
The fund declined 3.3 percent in the 12 months through Thursday, compared with losses of 6.5 percent for its group and 22.9 percent for the S.& P. 500, Morningstar said.
Mr. Southworth, 54, is a senior vice president of Northern Trust, which owns Northern Trust Investments, the fund's adviser. 
Generally, he said, convertible securities, which pay interest, give investors exposure to stock market profits but with less risk. His goal is to identify convertible issues with high potential for gains.
He picks the fund's 80 or so convertibles mostly from among about 600 domestic convertibles whose underlying common stock has good earnings growth potential and sells for reasonable valuations. 
While he reviews a company's fundamentals, including cash flow and earnings growth rate, he also pays attention to technical analysis -- the study of a stock's price movements -- over the last year or two.
When the price charts deviate from analysts' expectations, he said that he puts his faith in the charts, which reflect the actual behavior of the great majority of investors. 
In April, Mr. Southworth bought a convertible preferred security due in May 2005 issued by Alltel, a regional phone company based in Little Rock, Ark. He paid $49.81 for the issue, which yielded 7.75 percent; it closed on Friday at $47.90. Because the issue is a "mandatory convertible," which must convert to common shares on a specific date, regardless of its stock price at the time, its price fluctuates more like a high-yielding equity than a bond, Mr. Southworth said. It is unrated by Standard & Poor's but rated A2 by Moody's Investors Service, a midlevel investment grade rating. He expects annual earnings growth of 8 percent in the next three years.
He bought a 5.75 percent senior convertible note due in April 2007 and issued by Airborne Inc., in Seattle. He paid $94.34 for the note in October, 2002; it closed on Friday at $107.25. The issue is rated BBB- by Standard & Poor's, its lowest investment-grade rating. "The stock was bumping along at $10 because the market seemed to make the judgment that the economy would never recover," Mr. Southworth said. "We thought that we'd avoid a double-dip recession, and if the economy grows the transportation sector will have to participate."
He also owns a BB- rated subordinated convertible note due June 2006 issued by the Interpublic Group of Companies, the New York-based holding group of advertising agencies. Last summer, "Interpublic's stock price got clobbered when its earnings didn't meet expectations, and everyone worried about whether they can believe anything that management told us." he said. He bought the issue before the Securities and Exchange Commission notified Interpublic in January that it was upgrading an informal inquiry into the company's accounting practices to a formal investigation. "I don't know, whether the investigation will amount to anything," he said, "but I'm still reasonably happy with the purchase."
He paid $65.50. On Friday, the convertible note closed at $77.

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
IT did not seem impossible, just a few weeks ago, that China and the United States would work hand in hand to end the North Korean standoff. 
 Bush administration officials urged China to use its economic and diplomatic leverage to halt North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Some even wondered if China might emulate Germany in 1989, opening its borders to refugees and forcing North Korea to abandon totalitarianism or collapse. 
 It did not seem impossible in Washington, anyway. China, however, has shown few signs of dealing decisively with a crisis on its own doorstep. Instead, to an extent that has worried even some of China's own foreign policy experts, Beijing has been largely paralyzed by of one of the most challenging international problems it has faced since the Vietnam War. 
China has declined Washington's overtures to lead negotiations with its former ally across the Yalu River. It has also continued to summarily repatriate refugees from North Korea and deny them access to the United Nations, appearing to violate its obligations under a 1951 treaty.
China has the largest standing army in the world and spends more on its military than any country except the United States. It is also Asia's rising political and economic heavyweight. Yet the strongest statement the Chinese have mustered in the Korean crisis is an admonition to "both sides" -- meaning the United States and North Korea -- "not to take measures that will complicate matters." China's hesitancy may have surprised those in Washington who saw North Korea as China's client state. China, after all, did lose more than a million men battling American troops to a standstill in the Korean War. 
But Beijing began losing influence with the North Koreans in the 1980's under Deng Xiaoping, when it opened its economy and abandoned Communist-style planning. Things got worse in 1992, when China established an embassy in Seoul without insisting that the United States recognize North Korea first. In 1995, after Beijing reduced subsidized grain exports, North Korea had to swallow its pride and appeal to the United Nations for emergency food aid. 
Even in the area where China has the most to offer North Korea -- reforming its ruined command economy -- the two nations are barely on speaking terms. Last fall, China arrested Yang Bin, a Chinese tycoon whom Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, had selected to head a new economic development zone. Mr. Yang was charged with economic crimes in China. Mr. Kim, by most accounts piqued at Chinese interference, has yet to find someone else to head his planned capitalist enclave.
But China is not without leverage. Two-way trade between the nations is $740 million, about a quarter of North Korea's total trade, and Beijing still provides vital aid. But it has avoided taking a strong stand, at least in part because North Korea threatens to upset the carefully scripted plans of China's inward-focused leadership. 
Both Jiang Zemin, China's president, and his successor as Communist Party chief, Hu Jintao, care primarily about two things: economic growth and Taiwan. The rest of the world can worry about global terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, religious tensions, poverty and the increasing assertiveness of the United States. China just wants to get rich and reconstitute its territorial integrity.
Even on the always-sensitive topic of Taiwan, Chinese leaders have turned "extremely moderate," in the words of one senior official, because they are confident that economic ties will ultimately give them more leverage than test-firing missiles, as they did in the mid-1990's.
The soft approach has generally improved relations with the United States. China did not object to the occupation of Afghanistan, which put American troops on its western border. It does not like the Bush administration's aggressive Iraq policy any more than France does, but it does much less than France to challenge American leadership on the issue.
But Chinese timidity on North Korea may have made a bad situation worse. Some Chinese foreign policy experts are worried that the United States cannot solve the problem alone, hinting that China needs to do more, if only to protect its own interests.
Shi Yinhong, an international relations expert at People's University, argued in an essay published last week that China must reassess its strategic priorities. The problem, he said, is that even if the Americans negotiate in earnest, North Korea may have no incentive to abandon its development of nuclear weapons. It could develop an arsenal of warheads, possibly forcing Japan and South Korea to go nuclear, too. That would upend the strategic balance in Asia, which currently favors China.
"I'm fearful that when North Korea masters the rules of this game, it will have ample time to truly develop its own nuclear weapons," Mr. Shi wrote. "When that happens, it will really be the start of regional tensions."
Can the United States single-handedly bring an end to North Korea's nuclear ambitions? "This is highly doubtful," Mr. Shi wrote.
As a high-level American commission noted in a report last year, the long-term question about China is whether it becomes "a responsible world power or an aggressive, wealthy dictatorship." The short-term question, however, is when it will emerge from its foreign-policy cocoon.

HEADLINE: What's Behind The Retail Slump? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "A Sinking Feeling at the Register" (Jan. 19): It's primarily the retailer that is driving deflation. 
The United States has had too many stores for more than a decade. The buoyant economy of the 1990's, however, masked the problems of some retailers and encouraged others to continue adding stores. When the economy softened in 2000-01, retail overcapacity became a concern. 
 In the current environment, retailers can increase market share only at the expense of their competitors by becoming increasingly promotional. To cope with such price discounting, they're simultaneously reducing expenses and inventories. These savings are being used, in turn, to lower prices to the consumer to gain market share. And so the cycle will continue until the weak retailers fall by the wayside. 
American consumers are simply taking advantage of, and even demanding, lower prices. Consumer demand, in fact, is much stronger than most analysts believe; it has just been muted by the aggressive pricing strategies of retailers.

Fewer People Choosing Lasers Over Lenses

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
About 162 million people in the United States need some form of eyeglasses or contact lenses. So far, only about 3 million have tried to put away their glasses forever and undergo corrective laser surgery. 
 Prices have dropped for the most common form of laser surgery, called Lasik, to an average of around $1,600 for each eye, but 21 percent fewer people had laser correction in the first nine months of last year compared with the same period in 2001. David R. Harmon, president of Marketscope, an opthamology research firm, blames the weak economy for the falloff. The surgery is not covered by most insurance policies. 
Many people are satisfied with the surgery, but risks include impaired vision, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Details can be found at its Web site, www.fda.gov/cdrh/lasik.

For a Third Week, the 3 Major Indexes Fall

BYLINE:  By JEFF SOMMER 

 BODY:
All three major stock market indexes fell for the third consecutive week as the prospect of a possible war with Iraq weighed on investors.
 A rally on Friday could not counter two weeks of deep losses. 
For January as a whole, the Dow fell 3.5 percent, the Nasdaq declined 1.1 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.7 percent. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.2 points, or 0.9 percent, closing at 8,053.81. The S.& P. 500 lost 5.7 points, declining by 0.7 percent, to close at 855.70. The Nasdaq composite index, fell 21.23 points, or 1.6 percent, closing at 1,320.91.
 Economic news was mixed. On Friday, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago reported that manufacturing in the Midwest was expanding, while the University of Michigan said that consumer confidence sputtered in January.
 Hewlett-Packard declined more than 7 percent for the week on signs of weakness in demand for computers. AOL Time Warner, which announced the biggest yearly loss in American history, fell more than 17 percent.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.96 percent from 3.93 percent the previous week.

HEADLINE: Ah, Those Principled Europeans 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
Last week I went to lunch at the Hotel Schweizerhof in Davos, Switzerland, and discovered why America and Europe are at odds. At the bottom of the lunch menu was a list of the countries that the lamb, beef and chicken came from. But next to the meat imported from the U.S. was a tiny asterisk, which warned that it might contain genetically modified organisms -- G.M.O.'s.
 My initial patriotic instinct was to order the U.S. beef and ask for it "tartare," just for spite. But then I and my lunch guest just looked at each other and had a good laugh. How quaint! we said. Europeans, out of some romantic rebellion against America and high technology, were shunning U.S.-grown food containing G.M.O.'s -- even though there is no scientific evidence that these are harmful. But practically everywhere we went in Davos, Europeans were smoking cigarettes -- with their meals, coffee or conversation -- even though there is indisputable scientific evidence that smoking can kill you. In fact, I got enough secondhand smoke just dining in Europe last week to make me want to have a chest X-ray. 
 So pardon me if I don't take seriously all the Euro-whining about the Bush policies toward Iraq -- for one very simple reason: It strikes me as deeply unserious. It's not that there are no serious arguments to be made against war in Iraq. There are plenty. It's just that so much of what one hears coming from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and French President Jacques Chirac are not serious arguments. They are station identification.
They are not the arguments of people who have really gotten beyond the distorted Arab press and tapped into what young Arabs are saying about their aspirations for democracy and how much they blame Saddam Hussein and his ilk for the poor state of their region. Rather, they are the diplomatic equivalent of smoking cancerous cigarettes while rejecting harmless G.M.O.'s -- an assertion of identity by trying to be whatever the Americans are not, regardless of the real interests or stakes.
And where this comes from, alas, is weakness. Being weak after being powerful is a terrible thing. It can make you stupid. It can make you reject U.S. policies simply to differentiate yourself from the world's only superpower. Or, in the case of Mr. Chirac, it can even prompt you to invite Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe -- a terrible tyrant -- to visit Paris just to spite Tony Blair. Ah, those principled French.
"Power corrupts, but so does weakness," said Josef Joffe, editor of Germany's Die Zeit newspaper. "And absolute weakness corrupts absolutely. We are now living through the most critical watershed of the postwar period, with enormous moral and strategic issues at stake, and the only answer many Europeans offer is to constrain and contain American power. So by default they end up on the side of Saddam, in an intellectually corrupt position."
The more one sees of this, the more one is convinced that the historian Robert Kagan, in his very smart new book "Of Paradise and Power," is right: "Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus." There is now a structural gap between America and Europe, which derives from the yawning power gap, and this produces all sorts of resentments, insecurities and diverging attitudes as to what constitutes the legitimate exercise of force.
I can live with this difference. But Europe's cynicism and insecurity, masquerading as moral superiority, is insufferable. Each year at the Davos economic forum protesters are allowed to march through the north end of town, where last year they broke shop windows. So this year, on demonstration day, all the shopkeepers on that end of town closed. But when I walked by their shops in the morning, I noticed that three of them had put up signs in their windows that said, "U.S.A. No War in Iraq."
I wondered to myself: Why did the shopkeepers at the lingerie store suddenly decide to express their antiwar sentiments? Well, the demonstrators came and left without getting near these shops. And guess what? As soon as they were gone, the antiwar signs disappeared. They had been put up simply as window insurance -- to placate the demonstrators so they wouldn't throw stones at them.
As I said, there are serious arguments against the war in Iraq, but they have weight only if they are made out of conviction, not out of expedience or petulance -- and if they are made by people with real beliefs, not identity crises.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
The New Calculus Of Diversity on Campus

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

 BODY:
AT public universities in California and Texas, the end of affirmative action in admissions has benefited one minority: Asian-Americans.
 And if the Supreme Court decides later this year to limit or eliminate race-conscious admissions at the University of Michigan, Asian-Americans stand to gain far more than any other group, at least in proportion to their numbers in the general population. 
 Their experience in the admissions process provides yet another prism through which to view the affirmative action debate. As things stand now, a relatively low percentage of Asian-American students are admitted to many top private and public institutions, nearly all of which practice affirmative action, compared with the high numbers of the arguably qualified among them. 
But if the Supreme Court phases out race-conscious admissions, the number of Asian-American students can be expected to soar, at the expense of other groups, even whites.
The statistics in California and Texas give ammunition to critics of affirmative action who say that some applicants, primarily white or Asian-American, are being rejected in favor of blacks and Hispanics who may not be as accomplished, at least as measured by standardized-test scores and grade-point averages.
But the same statistics also provide ammunition to those who support race-conscious admissions and who argue that unless colleges give special attention to black and Hispanic applicants, whites and Asians could lay claim to all but a handful of the spots on some campuses. 
To gain a sense of how the composition of a student body can shift, consider the University of Texas at Austin. 
After a federal court in 1996 barred the University of Texas from practicing affirmative action, the state began offering admission to all high school students ranked in the top 10 percent of their classes. Given the racial and economic segregation in the state's high schools, the assumption was that blacks and Hispanics would be given a fairer chance to enroll, without having to compete directly with whites who lived in richer districts.
But as it turned out, the main beneficiaries were Asian-Americans. The percentage of freshmen entering the Austin campus who were Asian-American rose to 18 percent last fall, compared with 14 percent in the fall of 1995. Thus, almost one in five freshmen at the university's flagship school is Asian, in a state where only about three of 100 residents are. 
As the admission rate of Asian students rose, to 71 percent from 68 percent over that period, the admission rate of whites fell, by one percentage point to 66 percent. So did that of blacks, to 43 percent from 59 percent.
Hispanics were admitted at a rate of 56 percent in 2002, down from 72 percent in 1995. They make up about a third of the state population but less than a fifth of the freshman class at Austin.
Asked to explain the dynamic, Bruce Walker, the director of admissions at Austin, said, "Obviously they are the top students in their schools."
"Any state that goes to a percent plan and has a significant number of Asians will discover that Asians will be the ones who will benefit most," he added.
In California, where Asians make up 11 percent of the general population, the gains were also striking after the state ended traditional affirmative action in the late 1990's and adopted a system similar to that of Texas. 
At Berkeley, the percentage of the freshman class that was Asian-American rose 6 percentage points, to 45 percent, in 2001. Over the same period, the percentage of the class that was black fell by three percentage points, to 4 percent; the percentage that was white dropped by one percentage point, to 29 percent; and the percentage that was Hispanic fell by six percentage points, to 11 percent.
Contrast that with the experience of the University of Michigan Law School, which practices race-conscious admissions in a typical way, with admissions officers considering applicants' test scores and grades, as well as their backgrounds. Along with the undergraduate program, which uses a more formulaic approach that awards extra points to a black or Hispanic applicant, the law school is a defendant in the lawsuits being heard by the Supreme Court.
When, for example, it assembled its class for the fall of 1999, the law school accepted only one of the 61 Asian-Americans, or 2 percent, who were ranked in the middle range of the applicant pool, as defined by their grades and test scores, according to court filings. The admission rate for whites with similar grades and scores was 3 percent. 
But among black applicants with similar transcripts, 22 out of 27, or 81 percent, were offered admission. 
Michigan, like other selective colleges, defends the lift given to black applicants, as well as to Hispanics, for two main reasons: to level the playing field for what it calls underrepresented minorities, who might not have the educational advantages of many whites and Asians, and to enhance the educational experience of all students by immersing them in a diverse environment.
Though supportive of affirmative action for black and Hispanic applicants in particular, Evelyn Hu-DeHart, a professor of history and ethnic studies at Brown, said she took offense at the perception that there might be a threshold for how many Asians on a campus was too many.
"I'll tell you what is discriminatory in the case of Texas," said Ms. Hu-DeHart, who emigrated from China in the 1960's. "They don't say whites are overrepresented. They're pitting Asian-Americans against blacks and Latinos by saying Asian-Americans are taking your place."
She added: "Let Asians compete freely with white students."

HEADLINE: California Looks to Casinos for Revenue 

BYLINE:  By JOHN M. BRODER and CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Trying to close a $34 billion budget deficit, Gov. Gray Davis has cast a covetous eye on a gushing revenue stream just beyond his reach: the billions pouring into California's Indian reservations, where slot machines and blackjack have made casino gambling the fastest-growing industry in the state.
 States cannot tax sovereign Indian tribes. But they can strike deals. California reached one four years ago when it legalized Indian casinos. The economy was booming then, and state officials now admit that in negotiating the agreement, known as a compact, they bargained badly. While California's 50 Indian casinos took in an estimated $5 billion in profits last year, only a sliver of those riches went to the state. 
 Now Mr. Davis, hoping to exploit dissension among the tribes and the desire among some to expand their gambling business, wants to reopen the 20-year compact and negotiate a fat share of casino revenue, as states like Connecticut and New York have done. He projects that this could add $1.5 billion a year to state coffers, compared with less than $100 million estimated for the current fiscal year under the existing compact.
But in return, he may have to accept a stunning expansion of gambling in California.
In bargaining with the Indians, the state's only leverage is its ability to grant licenses for additional slot machines and other gambling devices. Gambling experts say that to get the $1.5 billion Mr. Davis seeks, the state would have to allow tribal gambling to at least double.
The most profitable big tribes are asking for an unlimited number of slot machines, currently capped at a total of 61,000 statewide. Some tribes are also pushing to get into sports betting and Internet wagering.
What happens in California, where Indian casinos produce about a third of the nation's $15 billion in tribal gambling revenue, will resonate across the country. Nevada is watching with particular wariness because the huge expansion being sought by the tribes here could starve Nevada's casinos of billions.
Opponents say there are already too many casinos in California, producing local environmental and traffic nightmares as well as thousands of new gambling addicts a year.
Many say that expanding gambling enough to produce the revenue California officials seek would amount to doubling down on an already bad bet.
"You're talking about expanding an industry that has a significant social effect on the public without any regulation or oversight," said Cheryl Schmit, co-director of Stand Up for California, an antigambling group. "That $1.5 billion figure is scary to me because it means a huge expansion. We are a scandal waiting to happen."
The smaller among California's 125 federally recognized tribes are unhappy too. In exchange for supporting the statewide compact in 1999, they were promised a piece of the action. Each of the 75 tribes that either run small operations or own no casinos at all was supposed to get more than $1 million a year under the Revenue Sharing Trust Fund, which the casino-owning tribes finance. But despite as much as $5 billion in casino profits last year alone, the smalltribes have received less than half the promised amount.
Casino gambling "was supposed to lift everybody's boat," said Anna Kimber, a lawyer who represents a consortium of smaller tribes. "To date that has not happened, and many people in Indian country are skeptical that it will happen under any new agreement."
The gambling operations provide plenty of cash for lobbying and political contributions, however. The tribes have spent more than $100 million since 1998 to win legalized gambling and to keep politicians in Sacramento friendly.
Mr. Davis's budget proposal for the coming fiscal year assumes $1.5 billion in fees from Indian gambling, one of several sources of new revenue, including an increase in the sales tax and higher income taxes on the wealthy. The figure was apparently arrived at by looking at the deals other states have cut with tribes. New York and Connecticut, for example, reap from 18 to 25 percent of the profit from slot machines and casino card games.
But California officials involved in overseeing gambling say they have little confidence that Mr. Davis and the Legislature will do a better job of bargaining than they did four years ago. They would not say so for attribution, voicing fear for their jobs.
One senior state regulator said the governor's $1.5 billion revenue estimate was "totally unrealistic." He added that New York and Connecticut had modeled their compacts on California's -- by doing everything differently from it. New York expects to reap as much as $400 million a year from its recent casino deal with the Seneca tribe alone.
California officials acknowledge that the 60-page compact Governor Davis and his aides hurriedly produced in 1999 was deeply flawed.
"When we entered the compacts in 1999, we were entering a brave new world, something that had never before been done here," said David Rosenberg, the governor's point man on Indian gambling issues. "We envisioned we would learn things."
Now the only way the state will get an additional penny from the tribes is by by allowing more gambling devices, including slots, video poker machines and even electronic roulette tables. It is impossible to know how many machines the traffic will bear, but the coming negotiations will provide a test of the tension between commercial hunger for profits and government hunger for revenue. "This will be a very interesting social study going forward," said Richard E. DeCuir, acting executive director of the California Gambling Control Commission.
Mr. Davis has appointed a three-member team to negotiate with the tribes. "My goal," he said, "is this: to ensure that all gaming tribes fulfill their obligations, obey the law and pay their fair share, both to the state and to nongaming tribes."
California tribes have varying interests in the bargaining. Some want to get into the business, some want to expand, and others are happy to keep things the way they are. Conflicts over land and Indian identity are also driving the tribes apart. Mr. Davis hopes the internal conflicts will work to the state's benefit by preventing the tribes from forming a common negotiating position.
The bottom line for most casino-owning tribes is threefold, tribal leaders and lawyers say. They want a ceiling on the fees they will pay to the state, they want to keep the exclusive right to run casinos in California (thus freezing out racetrack owners and others who want to operate slot machines), and they want an unlimited number of machines.
"As long as people want to buy what we have to sell," said Anthony Pico, chairman of the Viejas band,which runs one of the state's most profitable gambling operations, "then we should be able to move forward and sell it."

HEADLINE: Iran's Revolutionary Fervor Is Now All but Spent 

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Twenty-four years ago today, a 78-year-old ayatollah with fierce eyes named Ruhollah Khomeini landed in an Air France plane to make a revolution.
 As it has done every year since then, the Islamic Republic that was created in his name is celebrating the 10 days between his arrival and the surrender of the shah's army. 
 Big colored lights were strung on the city squares and public buildings. Iranian flags hung from lampposts. An honor guard on horseback waved bright red banners. Parachutists jumped from helicopters on huge rainbow-hued kites. Paintings and billboards were hung throughout the capital with sayings like, "The revolution was victorious only because of the sacrifices of our martyrs." 
But the revolutionary fervor that moved a nation to sacrifice for so long evaporated long ago. Ayatollah Khomeini promised a heaven on earth in which the poor and the oppressed masses would rule and be free. Instead, the country is plagued by political paralysis, corruption, unemployment, social restrictions and uneven and unnerving repression. A fierce guerrilla battle wages between those claiming to speak in the name of Islamic purity and those who call themselves democrats.
Iranians love to rhyme, and street vendors and taxi drivers have taken to calling the 10 days of "fajr," meaning dawn, the 10 days of "zajr" -- torture. There is so little zeal left that even the apparatus of the Islamic Republic, with its revolutionary foundations, the police and the Armed Forces, made almost no effort to mobilize the masses today. 
Nowhere was that more evident than at Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. That was Ayatollah Khomeini's immediate destination 24 years ago, where he honored those who lost their lives under the regime of the fallen shah and vowed to topple the monarchy forever. He was so badly jostled by the wave of people trying to touch him that his turban fell off.
Today, despite an official call to pray and remember, only about 300 men and a few dozen women came. Many of the folding chairs brought in for the occasion were empty. Schoolgirls in pale blue head coverings and royal blue coats came on a field trip not to honor Ayatollah Khomeini but to visit the tomb of a rival ayatollah who was silenced after he objected to the intrusion of religion into politics.
A soldier on guard duty cried out -- about fatigue. "My legs are breaking," he shouted to a colleague.
The anniversary of the coming of the ayatollah has set off the memories and recalled the dashed dreams of revolutionaries like Mohsen Sazgara, a leading reformist writer. A college student in the United States when Ayatollah Khomeini set himself up in exile in Paris in 1978, Mr. Sazgara quit school and borrowed $200 to join him there. He was one of the 190 aides and journalists on the historic plane trip.
"I remember the night before we were going to leave on that plane that Imam Khomeini called us together and said: 'This journey may have some dangers. Everyone who wants to stay behind, please stay.' But everyone said, 'We want to be with you.' We were ready to be martyred."
In the early part of the revolution, Mr. Sazgara worked to shape the official radio and the Revolutionary Guards. Then he fell from grace.
"Gradually they considered me part of the opposition," he said. "I write books and they don't allow them to be published. I started a newspaper and they shut it down. I was teaching history at a university and they stopped me.
"Let me confess something to you. My son just graduated from university this semester. Once he asked me, 'O.K., father, is it good that you were in the United States and gave up your studies and went to Paris and came to Iran to make this government?' I said: 'You're right. We made a mistake.' "
That sense of defeat is felt even in clerical circles in Qum, the country's training ground for clerics.
For Mohammad Ali Ayazi, a mid-ranking cleric who is in the vanguard of the clerical movement to reform the Islamic Republic, Feb. 11, 1979, the day when the shah's army surrendered, was "the happiest day" of his life. On that day, the revolution triumphed, and Mr. Ayazi's first child, Yasser, was born.
But Yasser Ayazi, a physics major in Qum, will not celebrate the anniversary. "People are not too happy these days," he said. "People need a democratic Islamic republic and justice, but I see a lot of problems still untouched, unsolved. So I am not feeling particularly warmly toward this celebration."
Ayatollah Khomeini died in 1989. But even at the shrine where he and his son Ahmed are buried, there was little Islamic fervor today.
None of the country's major political figures came to speak, and it was left to Hassan Khomeini, the ayatollah's grandson, to address the crowd. As he has done in past years, he praised his grandfather as "a selfless hero" who sacrifice all for the revolution.
"We should value the achievements of the revolution," he said. "This is a country that elects its own president, its own Parliament, its own leadership." By contrast, he said, George W. Bush was elected president "fraudulently with the power of the judiciary behind him."

PERSON: Evelyn Trout 

HEADLINE: Evelyn Trout, Record-Setting Flier, Dies at 97 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Evelyn Trout, a pioneering aviator who flew in the first Powder Puff Derby and held many records, including becoming the first woman to fly all night, died on Jan. 24 in San Diego. She was 97.
 Known as Bobbi for her bob hairstyle, she had an international pilot's license signed by Orville Wright in 1929 that was carried into space in 1995 by Eileen Collins, the first woman to be the pilot of an American spacecraft. 
 Miss Trout set many records for endurance and altitude; became the fifth woman to earn a transport license, allowing her to fly for hire; and was one of the first women to be a pilot for the Los Angeles Police Department. 
In 1929, she was one of 19 participants in the first National Women's Air Derby, a California-to-Ohio race that Will Rogers famously called the "first Powder Puff Derby." 
She had two hard landings on the trip. After the second, 70 miles short of Cleveland, she did her own repairs, using "old tin and baling wire," according to a 1999 interview with The Los Angeles Times. When she reach Cleveland, officials scolded her for taking such a risk.
"I told them, 'It got me here, didn't it?' " she said. She was the last survivor of the famous race.
Her fame, like that of other early daredevils, was such that Walt Disney hired her in 1928 to publicize Mickey Mouse, not yet a famous character, by taking aloft a planeful of Mickey Mouse dolls.
Remembering the glories of her youth in an interview with The Los Angeles Daily News in 1999, Miss Trout said, "People thought we were nuts."
Miss Trout was born in Greenup, Ill., on Jan. 7, 1906, and spent much of her childhood moving with her family around the country, staying with relatives. Her early ambitions were to be a cowgirl or a motorcycle racer, but when she was 16, she had her first plane ride in a Curtiss Jenny and was captivated.
She was adept at mechanics, but administrators at her Los Angeles high school made her take home economics, which she told The Los Angeles Times was a "sissy course." While still in high school, she persuaded her parents to buy a service station for her to run. Soon the station was so successful that her father quit his job with the phone company to help her run the business.
She said in an interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune that after high school she weighed the options of studying architecture in college or learning to fly. She decided to use her earnings from the service station for flying lessons.
The federal government gave her license number 2,613, meaning that just 2,612 pilots had been licensed before her. On Jan. 1, 1929, she received her international pilot's license, signed by Orville Wright, then chairman of the International Aeronautic Federation. 
Miss Trout had a $35-a-week job demonstrating a new monoplane called the Golden Eagle, and she set her first record on Jan. 2, 1929, when she stayed aloft for 12 hours and 11 minutes to beat Viola Gentry's women's endurance record of eight hours. The New York Times reported that she carried concentrated food and a bottle of hot chocolate.
On Jan. 31, 1929, Elinor Smith beat Miss Trout's time by an hour. The battle was on. On Feb. 13, Miss Trout stayed up for 17 hours, 5 minutes to regain the record and become the first woman to fly all night. Miss Trout said in an interview with The New York Times that she had only lent the record to Miss Smith for a couple of weeks.
On June 16, 1929, Miss Trout climbed to 15,200 feet in a new 90-horsepower Golden Eagle Chief. This set an altitude record in light aircraft for women.
In November 1929, Miss Trout and Miss Smith joined forces to set an endurance record. They hoped to stay up for a month by refueling from a gas hose lowered by a refueling plane. They lasted 42 hours, 3 1/2 minutes, but that was a record.
On Jan. 1, 1931, Miss Trout and Edna May, another pilot, set another record by flying for more than 122 hours.
In the 1930's, Miss Trout was a flying instructor and commercial photographer. In World War II, she invented a machine to sort unused rivets that were being scrapped by aircraft companies and developed a device for smoothing the edges of machined metal. Also in the war, the Los Angeles Police Department hired her and four other women to do aerial surveillance.
Miss Trout was single, and no immediate family members survive. In her later years, she sold real estate and insurance and participated in events honoring the pioneers of aviation.

Talking the Talk Of Collusion Redux

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
George Steinbrenner has experienced no more frustrating moment in his 30-year baseball life than that moment on the afternoon of Dec. 18, 1986. He let Jack Morris walk out of the Bay Harbor Inn, Steinbrenner's hotel, in Tampa, Fla., without an agreement to pitch for the Yankees.
 Morris had won 21 games for the Detroit Tigers the previous season, making him a 20-game winner for the second time in four seasons. (He missed a third by one victory.) The Mets had won the World Series less than two months earlier. 
 The Yankees had finished in second place behind Boston, but Dennis Rasmussen, with 18 victories, was their only pitcher with double-digit victories. Morris, a 31-year-old free agent, was exactly what the baseball doctor ordered. This is what free agency was all about. 
Yet Morris walked out of Room 600 of the Bay Harbor Inn without a Yankee deal. He was a victim of the second year of the owners' conspiracy against free agents. Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, was not a victim, but he surely was an unwilling participant, given his penchant for lavishing free agents with money.
The owners' collusive activity of the 80's serves as a backdrop for current events in baseball because the clubs have once again raised suspicion with some of their activities involving free agents. 
In 1985 and '86 teams did not try to sign free agents as long as their former teams wanted to retain them. In 1987, clubs made offers to free agents, but the offers were remarkably similar, courtesy of a secret information bank the clubs' labor unit maintained.
Scrutinizing the results of this winter's signing activity, union officials are not attributing the less lucrative contracts or the number of unsigned players to collusion. But agents have reported an unusual sameness or similarity in offers to some of their clients, and they have picked up hints that clubs are sharing information.
If the union, after an exhaustive investigation, determines grounds for a grievance, they will ask the arbitrator to decide if the clubs have violated the provision in the labor agreement that states, "Players shall not act in concert with other Players and Clubs shall not act in concert with other Clubs."
That provision exists because the clubs wanted it. When free agency came into existence in 1976, the clubs wanted to guard against the type of strategy that Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale had used in their contract negotiations with the Los Angeles Dodgers a decade earlier.
And then the owners ignored their own concerns and used the strategy themselves in 1985. Richard Moss, a player agent a decade after he argued the arbitration case that won free agency for the players, demonstrated clairvoyance when he made an observation less than two weeks into the free-agent signing season.
"Obviously, they have an understanding among each other that they're not going to go after free agents as long as the former club is involved," he said.
Just as management officials have denied collusive activity this off-season, they denied it then, too. Barry Rona was the owners' chief labor lawyer in those years, and when the word collusion was uttered, he would scoff and sneer.
"The clubs, in effect, are saying, 'I won't go after your players and you don't go after mine,' " he said that first winter, offering his explanation of events. "There's nothing wrong with that. They didn't sit down and agree to that. They're just doing it."
Union officials were not the only ones who were skeptical of that explanation. "Obviously, they didn't all wake up one day with the same thought," one manager said.
That winter Rona said, "To the best of my knowledge and information, there is no conspiracy, there are no rules, there are no bulletins, there are no regulations that exist that control the behavior of the clubs."
A year later, in January 1987, when Commissioner Peter Ueberroth said he would testify at the grievance hearing, Rona said, "I'm pleased the commissioner will be a witness and look forward to his testimony, which I am totally confident will finally put aside the union's allegations of conspiracy."
But their own constituents undermined the stonewalling stance of Ueberroth and Rona. Notes of owners meetings kept by Bill Giles and Dave Montgomery of the Philadelphia Phillies became critical evidence in support of the union's case. 
And from within the owners' ranks, too, came this telltale report. According to a person present at a meeting of Baltimore officials in September 1986, Edward Bennett Williams, the Orioles' owner, said, "Do you think the commissioner would let us sign Lance Parrish?"
In September 1987, Thomas Roberts, the arbitrator, found the owners guilty of violating the concerted action provision. Noting that after the 1985 season no clubs pursued free agents unless their 1985 clubs relinquished interest in them, he concluded that that "in itself, constitutes a strong indication of concerted action."
The right of the clubs to pursue free agents, he added, "no longer remained an individual matter to be determined solely for the benefit of each club."
"The contemplated benefit of a common goal was substituted," Roberts said.
In 2000, in a ruling in a case stemming from collusion, Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, referred to the "owners' deceit and fabrication" and their effort "to cheat their employees out of their rightful wages" and wrote, "The owners' mendacity in their 1980's collusive efforts to depress the ballplayers' income was in many ways as damaging to baseball as the Black Sox scandal of 1919."
The clubs would be convicted twice more of collusion. They would settle all three cases for $280 million. The payout to the affected free agents was left to the union, which is still dealing with the case.
Responding to the new suggestions of collusion, Rob Manfred, the clubs' chief labor executive, noted last week that when the clubs had just negotiated a labor agreement "that clearly moves the economics in your direction, why would you collude that year?"
He added, "It makes no sense."
The owners initiated Collusion I two months after negotiating a new agreement in which they gained a major concession from the players that raised eligibility for salary arbitration from two years to three.

The Windup, the . . .
Sandy Alderson, for one, was not surprised that the games in last October's World Series were like the Energizer bunny: they kept going and going and going.
"We had three of the four slowest starting pitchers in that Series," said the man in charge of baseball operations in the commissioner's office. 
And how did Alderson determine who the slowest pitchers were in the major leagues last season? Basically the formula is time of game minus time between innings and for pitching changes divided by total number of pitches. The result is adjusted seconds a pitch.
One problem with the result is it does not cover only the time the starting pitcher is in the game. His time a pitch includes the time and pitches for all of the others who pitch in a game for his team. 
But Alderson and his crew want to identify only the pitchers they think work too slowly. Based on the formula, Livan Hernandez of San Francisco was the slowest-working pitcher in the majors last season, averaging one pitch every 30.7 seconds. He pitched in the World Series as did No. 3, his teammate Russ Ortiz (30.1), and Kevin Appier of Anaheim (30.0), who tied for fourth with Andy Pettitte of the Yankees.
The Atlanta Braves have acquired not only Ortiz, but also No. 2 on the slow monitor, Mike Hampton (30.4).
The fastest pitchers last season were Mark Buehrle (25.6) and Dan Wright (25.8) of the Chicago White Sox, Glendon Rusch of Milwaukee (25.9), Wade Miller of Houston (26.3) and Paul Wilson (26.3), then of Tampa Bay, now of Cincinnati.
The average adjusted seconds a pitch in the majors was 27.9.

Home Field, Home Phone
Before Fenway Park, before Yankee Stadium, before Wrigley Field there was Comiskey Park. But no longer. The second incarnation of Comiskey will give way to a new name. U.S. Cellular Field will take its place alongside all of those other new-name parks that give fans no idea of who plays in them.
The Chicago White Sox played in the first Comiskey from 1910 through 1990 and have played in the second since 1991. Now the second will take on a new name, but it will not mask the mistake the White Sox made in having it built as the first but the worst of the new-era parks.

Therapeutic Treatments For Title IX

BYLINE:  By SELENA ROBERTS 

 BODY:
MAYBE it wasn't the salt exfoliation treatments the fellas looked forward to, but on the night before every home football game last season, the Colorado Buffaloes left dorm life for a luxury retreat.
 About 15 miles from the campus in Boulder, Colo., at the foot of mountains that press like cleats against the sky, the Buffaloes settled into the high thread-count digs of the nearby Omni Resort. 
 Its Mobil four-star rating isn't for the plush towels alone, but for the soothing spa, the 27-hole golf course and aromatherapy massages. Who wouldn't focus better with eucalyptus burning? So, the team with a 100-man roster hunkered down at the Omni to prepare its game face (facial, not included). 
And imagine, college wrestling coaches have blamed Title IX for the elimination of their sports.
Perhaps Dennis Franchione's pledge of loyalty to Bama came with fingers crossed, because when the folks at Texas A&M offered him enough money, his Sweet Home Alabama went up for sale.
One of nearly 20 Division I-A football coaches to cash in after the $1 million barrier was broken a decade ago, Franchione signed a deal that will put him near $2 million a year -- another benefactor of the Bob Stoops Syndrome. Three years ago, Stoops became hotter than a corporate turnaround artist when he delivered Oklahoma's football program from evil during a run to the national title. Fearing Stoops would flee, the Sooners secured him with a $2 million salary. 
And imagine, parents blame Title IX when college administrators take away the men's swim team in an attempt to abide by proportionality guidelines.
"Go point by point and compare football to the cost of the teams that are getting eliminated," said Andrew Zimbalist, professor of economics at Smith College and author of "Unpaid Professionals: Commercialism and Conflict in Big-time College Sports." "You can see there is more than enough money out there for everyone if they would just get rid of the waste."
The cost difference between a 117-player roster versus a 90-man roster is about $800,000, Zimbalist said, who added that an average wrestling team costs $330,000. Put money and proportion to good use, and you save a wrestling program.
It's not Title IX that threatens men's sports, but the entitlement of football programs. It's not manufactured women's teams, but mythical revenues from football. It's not excess of women's uniforms, but the $250,000 Oregon spent on a 34th Street billboard in Manhattan for a Heisman Trophy candidate.
Yet, out of the jumble of fix-it strategies for Title IX -- many emerging from the subjective minds of a Bush administration commission this past week -- there was no insistence on football reform. In the end, the group actually gave a tacit green light for more inflatable football rosters by providing Education Secretary Rod Paige with the leeway to play with the numbers regarding walk-ons and nonscholarship athletes.
Instead of a male-female ratio that is proportionate to enrollment under current Title IX interpretation, if applied, the new system would count the number of roster spots, not the number of participants, toward compliance. Potentially, this could give universities the freedom to deflate numbers of male athletes and pump up those for women.
It would be nice if athletic departments could be trusted to do the right thing -- understanding how Title IX in its current form has been the source of an athletic boom for women -- but football is too seductive to allow room for faith.
As the legend goes, football programs rake in millions, allowing athletic departments to indulge. "We've gone to a hotel because our players are spread out all over campus," said Jon Burianek, Colorado's senior associate athletic director for business. "Some live in dorms where, on a Friday night, it's not a conducive atmosphere."
Beer bong or playbook, it's an easy choice at the Omni. Star treatment is a good recruiting tool. While Burianek said Colorado is treading water in meeting its budget, he sees the hotel as a necessary perk.
"You have to be careful," Burianek said. "You don't want to kill the golden goose." Is it fool's gold, though? As money comes and goes at equal speeds, administrators can easily play puppeteer with the numbers.
"You can have a $100 million stadium that is being funded off a state bond," Zimbalist said. "The cost of servicing the bond could be $10 million a year, but that's not charged to the athletic department."
A marching band could be on an athletic department's budget or charged to the music department. The shuffling can go on and on, Zimbalist said. 
If money isn't the only object, what is? Brand identity. Most often, football is where the prestige is, where trustee pride grows. Other sports are just filler in between the big game on campus.
The obsession is worrisome. Officials fret over football expenditures, but there is no help for the compulsive shopper when winning is a job requirement. The cycle isn't hopeless, though. There is a way to balance Title IX compliance against football's image benefits: put a cap on rah-rah-based spending.
"What the N.C.A.A. ought to do is go to Congress and lobby for an antitrust exemption," Zimbalist said. "I'm sure they would get it."
It's a radical approach, but if implemented, there could be salary ceilings, roster structure and limits on luxuries. Imagine, money for all, sports for each gender and no one to blame.

HEADLINE: To All the Nuclear Fears Swirling Around Indian Point Plant, Add Fear Itself 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

 BODY:
As the government reassesses emergency preparedness at the Indian Point nuclear power plant, it faces a conundrum: the more often that opponents of the plant say the emergency plans will not work, the more likely they are to be right.
 That conclusion was outlined in a recent report by James Lee Witt, former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is reviewing disaster plans at Indian Point. 
 Beneath the basic conclusion of Mr. Witt, now a consultant to New York State, that the plan is inadequate, is a second problem: the current debate over Indian Point is having the perverse effect of making emergency action, if necessary, harder, and people who dislike the plant are making things worse. 
"Advocacy groups use language whose emotional content can increase unnecessary evacuation, and thus can have adverse consequences for public health in the event of a release," the report said. 
Unnecessary evacuation, experts say, would clog the roads with people who could safely stay put, a phenomenon argued over since 1979, when emergency planning for nuclear plants began, called "shadow evacuation."
How much would occur is a matter of speculation, but Mr. Witt said some parties were encouraging it. "In pursuit of their agenda to close Indian Point, some have misused" data from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, he said, "presumably to frighten and alarm the public. Misuse of information can lead to behavior that may endanger public health and safety."
FEMA is supposed to sort this out sometime in February, when it will produce a new report on preparedness for the reactors, in Buchanan, N.Y. The report will consist of its evaluation of the September 2002 emergency exercise at Indian Point and an evaluation of Mr. Witt's work. Current officials of the agency said they would not talk about the Witt report until their review was done.
But Mike Beeman, a spokesman for FEMA, listed exactly the same concern as Mr. Witt: "It will work if people understand what they should do if there were an event that occurred at the plant, and understood that they should listen to people providing the directions to them." Otherwise, he said, the potential for paralysis on the roads would increase.
Why, then, is the public becoming more concerned without becoming more educated? Because, according to the Witt report, some people want it that way, to close the plant.
"Their persistent misuse of scientific data contributes to public misinformation," his report complained. "Ending those parts of their effort that can with fairness be termed demagoguery would serve the public better, and make more effective the participation of advocacy groups in the regionwide planning process."
Mr. Witt did not further define which advocacy groups he was talking about, and a spokeswoman for his consulting firm said he would not comment further until the report was complete. It is currently in a "public comment" period that resembles those that accompany the official reports of the government agency he used to head.
And no one was willing to own up to deliberately misrepresenting information to scare the public. 
"There is nothing that we've said publicly that is inaccurate or misleading," said Kym Spell, a spokeswoman for Riverkeeper, the nonprofit organization that is one of the most prominent opponents of the nuclear plant. "I can't speak for James Lee Witt; I don't know who he's referring to," she said. Riverkeeper's position is that emergency plans will never be good enough.
Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, another prominent opponent, said that opposition to Indian Point was now a "great social movement" and that like all such movements, it was diverse and might, in fact, include people who said things that were not true. Mr. Brodsky said he had not concluded that adequate emergency plans were impossible, but that there were plenty of other reasons to close the plant, many of them economic.
Mr. Witt himself, although he found numerous deficiencies, stopped well short of saying the plans could not be made workable, and also said that there was more to coping with an emergency than planning. "Organizations and people have the ability to adapt during a response, so actions can vary emergency to emergency," his report said. "Many preparedness shortfalls can be addressed in a response using emergency processes or adaptation, whereas systemic issues can be much more problematic. We have focused on the systemic, while acknowledging that many things can be 'handled' if an emergency were actually to occur."
How FEMA will read that balance is not clear; Mr. Beeman said it had a clear scope of what it would look at. (Not on the list, he said, was whether opponents were misusing data to scare the public.) But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is likely to have the final say, has a different outlook, according to one of its members, Edward McGaffigan.
"We have to have 'reasonable assurance of adequate protection of the public health and safety,' " he said in a telephone interview. "It doesn't say absolute assurance or perfect protection of public health and safety."
"A lot of this emergency planning stuff may well come down to a vision that these plans have to be perfect," he said.

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: THE REACTION; 
Sorrow, Memories of Challenger and a Will to Move Ahead

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
"Don't cry, Mom, but they are gone," the voice from London said when Beverly Poon, a municipal bus driver in San Francisco, picked up the telephone this morning.
 The caller was Ms. Poon's daughter, Beverly Alcorn, an emergency room nurse in the Air Force posted to England. She was watching images on television of the space shuttle Columbia as it broke into pieces in the skies over Texas. 
 Ms. Poon did cry. And so did her daughter. Though they did not know anyone on the spacecraft, they felt an intense connection to the disaster. It was in 1986, when the space shuttle Challenger exploded, killing the schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe and six other astronauts, that Ms. Alcorn vowed to enlist in the military, Ms. Poon said. Her daughter was 15 at the time. 
"Seeing what happened to Christa McAuliffe made her want to be the best of the best," said Ms. Poon, 53, tears welling in her eyes as she shared her sorrow with several other drivers at the downtown bus terminal here. "That is how I always explained terrible things to my children. Yes, it is a heart breaker, but look what went before that. These people lived their dream."
The sadness was everywhere today. Sadness for the families of the dead astronauts. Sadness for a country still feeling the hurt of Sept. 11, and apprehensive about a possible war with Iraq. Sadness for a space program that is a source of great national pride. And sadness for the distant countrymen of Col. Ilan Ramon, a former Israeli combat pilot and the first Israeli to travel in space.
"This kind of thing just brings everybody down," said Mike Kelly, an engineer from Grosse Pointe Park, Mich., who was running errands when his wife called to tell him of the disaster. "And what the country needs now is some positive news."
In Washington, at the National Air and Space Museum, more than 100 people crowded beneath a mock-up of the Hubble telescope, their eyes fixed on a 50-inch screen broadcasting a news conference from NASA. Next to the television, a small sign served as a painful reminder of the screen's intended purpose: "Transmissions from Shuttle Orbiter Columbia, Landing, Feb 1, 9:16 a.m."
Ziv Neeman, an Israeli physician who works at the National Institutes of Health, went to the museum with his family after hearing about the explosion. It was the only place that it made sense to go to, he said.
"It was supposed to be a great day for Israelis," Dr. Neeman said. "With all the horrible things going on, this was supposed to be a light."
At William Horlick High School in Racine, Wis., where one of the astronauts, Laurel Salton Clark, had graduated, displays of her accomplishments were suddenly transformed into memorials. Flowers piled up at the school's entrance and moments of silence were observed during an afternoon wrestling match. Attendance was higher than usual, as people congregated at the school to talk about what had happened.
"It's kind of like having a huge hole taken out of your stomach," said William Freyer, a social studies teacher, who had taught Ms. Clark.
For many people, the news about Columbia came in anxious telephone calls from friends and relatives. Others learned of the disaster on the radio. Still others, like Robert Aubey, caught the first shocking images of the splintering spacecraft when television news broke into the morning's cartoon shows.
For Mr. Aubey, of Madison, Wis., it was one of those awful moments for a parent, much like Sept. 11 had been. He was watching "Dora, the Explorer" with his son, Connor, who is 4, when a bulletin about Columbia flashed across the screen. After realizing the gravity of what had happened, he switched to the Cartoon Network. He then slipped out of the room to follow the news reports on another television.
"I didn't know how to explain what had happened," said Mr. Aubey, who later took his two sons and wife shopping to get away from the television coverage. "We don't necessarily want to talk about it with the children."
In Grosse Pointe Park, it had been a good week for Mr. Kelly, whose wife, Beth, gave birth to their first child on Thursday. But her telephone call this morning about the disaster sent him reeling. A self-described "science buff," Mr. Kelly said he feared for the future of the space program and worried about the repercussions for a wobbly economy.
Mostly, though, he mourned the loss of life. Like Ms. Poon, the bus driver, Mr. Kelly's thoughts drifted to 1986, when he had watched the Challenger explosion on television while holed up sick in a hotel room. 
"I remember this hollow feeling," Mr. Kelly said.
Heather Natsch, 26, a graduate student in San Francisco, said the disaster also reminded her of the Challenger. She was in elementary school then. Things seemed simpler 17 years ago, she said, and the country quickly rallied. Her teachers brought the children together to watch coverage on television and to talk about the process of mourning.
This time, Ms. Natsch said, there seemed to be so many other issues and distractions. She wondered how Americans would respond.
"We've got our resources spread so thin," she said. "There are so many things going on in so many places. I'm concerned this accident won't get the same attention as the Challenger."
Though the Bush administration said there was no evidence that the disaster today was related to terrorism, some people said it would be difficult to separate the tragedy from the tense state of world affairs.
Gracie Farkas, 48, of South Bend, Ind., had watched a shuttle launch at Cape Canaveral, Fla., about five years ago. She still remembers vividly how the spacecraft caused a tremendous shaking of the ground. Today, she said, terrorism was the first thing that came to mind.
"Isn't it an eerie coincidence that this would happen when there is a crisis in the Middle East?" Ms. Farkas said. "I just find it ironic given the crisis of the world right now."
In Grosse Pointe, Mich., Dr. Bonnie Stanton, a pediatrician, said she hoped the loss of the Columbia would somehow cool the fiery oratory toward Iraq and slow the march toward war.
"I just wish people would stop and think," said Dr. Stanton, who opposes a military conflict with Iraq. "It's so easy to be cavalier until something like this wakes us up and reminds us what every death is like."
Charles B. Hendrix of Florence, Ala., feared that the disaster would prove a distraction at a time when the nation cannot afford one.
"It's a shame that something like this has to happen just as we are about to go into battle," Mr. Hendrix said
Ms. Poon, the bus driver in San Francisco, said she served in the Army during Vietnam and the Persian Gulf war. She was not fearful of a military conflict with Iraq. She also did not read hidden meanings into the Columbia disaster. But she shared the view that the calamity over the skies of Texas carried significance far beyond the event itself.
"What will not break us, makes us stronger," Ms. Poon said. "I believe in this country. I believe in the innate ability of Americans to survive. We will survive this one too."
Dr. Neeman, the Israeli physician, also saw hope in the darkness. This morning, his four-year-old son, Omer, threw a coin into a fountain and wished to become an astronaut. "There will be more Israeli astronauts," Dr. Neeman said.
He also suggested that there was solace in such a distant death in the sky.
"It is a wonderful place to die," he said. "It is the closest you can get to heaven." 
But for Cynthia Strachan, a store manager in Buchanan, Mich., yet another fiery end to a space mission made it difficult to look toward the sky with optimism. She watched the television in tears as President Bush addressed the nation.
"It's just horrific," Ms. Strachan said. "Everyone used to look up at the stars and used to be so idealistic."

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: THE PAST; 
Space Program's Cycles of Triumph and Tragedy

BYLINE:  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN 

 BODY:
America's 44-year adventure into space has been a chronicle of triumph and tragedy, of early manned flights that circled the earth and landed on the moon, of explosions that killed astronauts, of cost overruns and corruption, and of robot satellites that explored the Solar System and sent home amazing pictures and data from other worlds.
 The chapters have been called Mercury, Gemini, Pioneer, Mariner, Apollo and the less glamorous space shuttle, and the issues have been complex, combining national aspirations, cold-war politics, the endless human quest for scientific knowledge and the hard practical questions of cost and feasibility. 
 After the Soviet Union leaped first into space with the orbiting of Sputnik I in 1957, American fears of losing the space race led to the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1958. Through the 1960's, it focused on putting Americans on the moon, although it also launched weather and communication satellites andachieved many other goals. 
The $25 billion space shuttle was envisioned in the 1970's as the successor to the successful moon-landing program. Less expensive and ambitious than a manned mission to Mars, the reusable shuttle was to revolutionize exotic space flight by turning it into an inexpensive, once-a-week event, paying its own way by deploying and repairing satellites and selling other space services.
But almost from the start, the shuttle was plagued by design failures, cost overruns, delays, fraud and mismanagement within NASA and its contractors. Many problems were hidden until the 1986 explosion of the Challenger, which killed seven astronauts. More recently, an aging work force and management shortcomings have continued at NASA, experts say, and these and other problems are expected to be explored in the inquiries into yesterday's Columbia tragedy.
In the early years, NASA exploits, including Alan B. Shepard Jr.'s suborbital spaceflight in 1961 and John Glenn's three-orbit flight in 1962 -- seemed to be the stuff of science fiction, with splashdowns broadcast to millions on television and heroes stepping from capsules.
Begun in 1958 and completed in 1963, the Mercury program was the nation's first man-in-space project, although its six flights accomplished much more, sending up the first weather and communications satellites, devising ways to launch and recover spacecraft and investigating human ability to work in space.
From 1964 to 1966, Gemini put astronauts into orbit for up to two weeks, with some of them stepping outside their capsules for spacewalks. A Ranger 7 rocket sent back close-up images of the moon before crashing on the lunar surface in 1964. A year later Mariner 4 flew within 6,118 miles of Mars, providing the first close-up images, and in 1966 Surveyor 1 made America's first soft landing on the moon and transmitted 10,000 photos of the lunar surface.
There were setbacks, even tragedies, as NASA worked under pressure of tight budgets and technical difficulties to carry out President John F. Kennedy's 1961 call for the nation to put a man on the moon before the end of the decade.
On Jan. 27, 1967, the astronauts Virgil I. Grissom, Edward H. White II and Roger B. Chaffee were killed on the launchpad at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral when a flash fire engulfed their capsule during a simulation aboard an Apollo-Saturn rocket. They were the first deaths directly attributable to the space program.
But the 1960's were its glory years. In December 1968, Apollo 8, with the astronauts Frank Borman, James A. Lovell Jr. and William A. Anders on board, circled the moon and, focusing a television camera on earth, sent to worldwide television audiences the first view of the "blue marble."
The halcyon period reached a climax in 1969 with the Apollo 11 moon landing. On July 20 Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. touched down in a lander while Michael Collins orbited in a command module. Setting foot on the surface, Armstrong told millions of viewers it was "one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
Before returning to earth, the astronauts spent 21 hours on the moon, taking rocks and soil, setting up experiments and planting an American flag. 
The Apollo 13 mission, in 1970, was a near disaster. An oxygen tank ruptured as the craft neared the moon, damaging power, electrical and life-support systems. The lunar landing was scrapped. After circling the moon, the astronauts used the lunar landing module as a lifeboat to return to earth. With limited air and water, they endured an ordeal but landed safely.
There were other moon landings, including Apollo 15 in 1971, the first of three longer, expedition-style missions using a lunar rover. In 1972, Apollo 17 was the last of six moon missions; the astronauts spent 22 hours in moon walks and camped out for three days. In all, 12 men walked on the moon before the Apollo program ended. 
Meanwhile other projects went ahead. In 1971, Mariner 9 became the first Mars orbiter, and over the next two years Pioneer 11 went to Jupiter and sent back dramatic cloud-top and polar pictures. Viking 1 landed on Mars in 1976 and transmitted data for six years.
By the early 1970's, however, the nation's space program was entering a new and more troubled phase. While a manned mission to Mars was a possibility, it it was seen by political leaders and the public as far too expensive, at least for the forseeable future. The development of a reuseable space shuttle emerged as an economical and practical interim step.
The Nixon administration embraced it initially to promote scientific and military goals and to help shore up the ailing aerospace industry. It was sold to Congress on the assumption that it would pay for itself through business it would generate: shuttling up to deploy and repair many private commercial satellites, and other tasks.
From the start, however, the program set unrealistic goals, as many as 60 flights a year, and was plagued with cost overruns, delays and other problems. By 1981, when Columbia became the first shuttle, each launch was costing $250 million, 16 times the original estimates. But many of the worst problems were hidden until the shuttle Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986.
Investigations later showed that faulty welds in a booster rocket -- faults that had been concealed through falsified X-rays by a subcontractor to avoid the cost of repairs -- had gone undetected and uncorrected until NASA auditors were tipped off by former employees of the subcontractor.
Investigators also learned that NASA had drastically cut spending on safety testing, design and development, even skipping thermal and vibration tests on the shuttle and its engines. Instead of testing component parts, contractors only tested assembled systems, investigators said. And they said NASA had misled Congress on costs and schedules, withheld documents, violated federal codes and squandered billions.
After the Challenger disaster, the shuttle was grounded until 1988. Since then, NASA has sought to make safety paramount, but critics have said this has fostered a conservatism that has led to further delays and cost overruns.

HEADLINE: Sheff Is Just the First Step 

BYLINE:  By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
NO sooner had Benjamin Otto of Glastonbury been accepted to the Greater Hartford Academy of the Arts, a magnet school, than his parents heard there might not be enough money in the town's budget to send him. So last spring, Benjamin, then 13, stood before the somber faces of his local board of education and asked for the $3,500 to send him to the school.
 "I told them how it's kind of like a family there, that it's just really fun," said Benjamin, who also urged the board to pay for the two dozen or so Glastonbury students accepted to the school. "All the kids there are nice, every single one. These are kids from other suburbs, kids from pretty much all over the state. It's a very evenly mixed school." 
 His parents figured the session would take half an hour, but they sat for three hours, as school administrators puzzled over how they would come up with the cash. The compromise: his parents would pay half. Administrators throughout the Greater Hartford area are even more puzzled now that Hartford's long-running desegregation case, Sheff vs. O'Neill, has been settled. The particulars of the settlement, announced late last month, are wending their way to suburban school districts, including the news that eight new magnet schools are to open in the Hartford area in the next four years in a move to attract more suburban children to city schools.But even before the particulars are digested, it is clear that the agreement hinges on two things: The willingness of suburban parents to send their children to school in a city with a dismal education history and, like all things, money, which Gov. John Rowland has made all too clear is in short supply. State officials said the cost of the new magnet schools would be paid in full by the state and Hartford, , but suburban officials questioned their ability to do so over the long run. "The state has consistently shown a pattern of coming up with new initiatives, particularly when it comes to schools, then not funding them," said Mary Tomolonius, Canton's first selectwoman. "Equalized cost-sharing was supposed to help towns pay for education. That has been cut. The school-construction grant program, now they are monkeying with those figures, and they are considering delaying payments to school construction projects. I have general concerns that when the state says it is going to pay for something, is it really going to pay? I have great trepidation when they say it's not going to cost the towns anything."
Sheff vs. O'Neill, filed in 1989, claimed that segregation in Hartford schools deprived students of the education guaranteed them under the state constitution. Numbers have changed little in Hartford since the suit was filed; about 90 percent of Hartford schoolchildren are minorities. The case dragged through the courts, until in 1996 the State Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. But it left the practical application of a solution to the groups involved. The state instituted numerous programs to promote integration, yet the numbers in Hartford wouldn't budge. Today, only 10 percent of Hartford's school children are involved in the magnet schools. The settlement demands a 30 percent involvement over four years. It also doubles the Open Choice program, which sends Hartford students to suburban schools. 
The state is indeed saying the new magnet schools will cost the towns nothing. The schools will be called "host magnets," meaning they will be run by the city of Hartford. The existing host magnets, unlike the magnets run by the Capitol Region Education Council, do not charge tuition and neither will the new ones. The state insisted it would stay that way."The bottom line is that in the past five years, in good budgets and in bad, we always have funded the magnet schools," said Marc S. Ryan, the state's budget director. "But that doesn't mean this is going to be easy."
The host magnets are in comparison to the four inter-district magnet schools in Hartford, including the arts academy that Benjamin Otto is attending, run by the Capitol Region Education Council. They do charge towns for each of their children attending the schools. Many town education officials said they are already having trouble affording the fees and fear that similar fees will eventually be charged at the new schools.
One thing that makes the towns nervous is that the state's four-year contribution to the Sheff agreement is predicated on the belief that the economy will improve by next year. This year the state will spend $4.5 million under the agreement. That will build to a $45 million total at the end of four years. 
School districts are not so sure about the economy and are looking to cut where they can and conserve elsewhere. Simsbury has 40 students attending magnet schools. Schools Superintendent Joseph Townsley expected the tuition to the capitol region-run magnet schools to increase this year."I was concerned about the state keeping its fiscal commitment to the magnet, which they weren't able to do last year," he said. "That's still a concern, and the state has a significant debt that we need to address."
Local boards of educations also face difficult decisions at a time when the state is decreasing the amount of money towns get. Local taxpayers also may not support a budget where money could go out of town to the Hartford-area magnets rather than paying to hire another teacher to reduce crowding in the local schools. As the choices increase and the money tightens, "the problem will become more shaky," said Robert Villanova, the school superintendent of Farmington. "Even if this wasn't a tight budget year, we'd be struggling with those issues. This will be a test, in part because we have more students going than in the past and less money this year." 
Simsbury's Mr. Townsley took an informal survey of several suburban schools and found that school budgets had increased between 9 and 10 percent. Towns can draw in some revenue under the Open Choice program, in which students from Hartford attend school in the suburbs. But suburban school superintendents said they come up short in that exchange. In Simsbury, 69 students travel to the town from Hartford in the Open Choice program. The state pays Simsbury $2,000 for each of those students. The town then pays anywhere between $2,000 and $3,500 per Simsbury student to attend the magnets in Hartford. 
"It's clear to everyone the math does not work," he said. "An incoming student with $2,000, coming into a district whose per-pupil cost may range from $8,000 to $9,500, does not support a revenue flow. We're paying to educate those children from Hartford. The formula has to be changed. They should have more money follow the child."
The monetary difficulties overshadow the enthusiasm many suburban parents feel for the magnet school programs. Some of the schools have a waiting list and the hope among education officials is that the new magnets become just as popular. A few days after the Sheff settlement had been announced, three parents who were waiting in an orthodontist's office in Rocky Hill for their children to have their braces adjusted offered different reactions to the settlement.One parent sends her children to Catholic school in Middletown. She said she would not consider the magnet schools in Hartford. "Why change?" said the woman, who would not give her name. Another had never heard of the magnet schools, or Sheff vs. O'Neill. The third already sends his son to the Hartford arts academy."The schools in Rocky Hill are really good, but he wanted to try something different," said Don Hutchinson of his son, Sean, a freshman. "He loves it. But with the state cutting money to towns, and more call among the students to attend these schools, even with all the new options, fewer kids may be able to go."
The most popular magnet schools in Hartford are run by the Capitol Region Education Council, which has been running in the red for years. Every child costs about $9,500 to educate in council-run schools. The state budget pays $5,300 per suburban child, and the suburbs pay about $2,000 for full-time programs. That equals $7,300, about $2,200 short of the actual education cost. The shortfall has been picked up by the State Department of Education, about $4 million last year and projected at $6 million this year.
"Because the new magnet schools will be host magnets, we're not going to perpetuate that funding formula, but we have to solve the problem that is there," said Bruce Douglas, executive director of the Capitol Region Education Council and a former school superintendent in Suffield. "Suburban school districts can't afford to pay any more tuition, and yet these districts are trying to be socially conscious." 
The Hartford-host magnet schools formula is a bit more complicated. Hartford public schools use their budget to educate their own students in the magnets, plus receiving a subsidy from the state of about $1,700 per Hartford student. Add to that the $5,300 the schools get from the state for each suburban student. Because of all that money, Hartford does not have to charge suburban towns tuition."Of course, if every student is going to get a laptop and a trombone, that might require some type of tuition," said Tom Murphy, spokesman for the Department of Education. The bigger question may be whether the Hartford system can replicate what the council has done with the magnet schools. . The recent successes of both Anthony Amato, former Hartford schools superintendent, and his successor, Robert Henry, to increase test scores and attendance are helping to buttress those hopes. For parents throughout the Greater Hartford region, the possibilities are enticing."Who knows what they're going to come up with?" said David Colleary of West Hartford, whose daughter attends Kingswood-Oxford, a private school in town, and whose son, a fifth-grader, attends local schools. "We're pretty excited about it. I think it's a win-win for everybody involved, and we will certainly investigate all opportunities. The more the merrier."

HEADLINE: Two Cities Beton Power 

BYLINE:  By MARK PETERS 

 BODY:
THE fact that two new power plants should produce enough electricity to light a million homes means little in Milford and Meriden, the communities where they are being built. Instead, what matters is the promise of newly paved streets, additional teachers and lower property taxes that the plants represent.
 The question is when -- or whether -- that promise will be fulfilled. Construction on both plants has stalled and neither has announced a date for the start of operations. 
 Considerable money is at stake. Even before selling a single watt of electricity, each plant has become the largest taxpayer in its community. This year, the plant in Milford , which has a population of 52,000 residents, is expected to pay $5.3 million in property taxes. The Meriden plant will pay $2.9 million under a long-term tax agreement with the city of of 58,200 people.
Both plants would take advantage of state legislation passed in 1998 that deregulated the power industry. Developers targeted Meriden and Milford because they have essential components for the plants: access to the regional power grid, water andpipelines to supply the natural gas needed for the plants' operation. 
If completed, each plant would produce 544 megawatts of electricity, to be sold in Connecticut and beyond. A megawatt is enough electricity to power 1,000 homes. "I would expect both of these facilities to compete," said Joel Rinebold, executive director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy at Eastern Connecticut State University. Elected officials, both past and present, said they believed the plants will ultimately begin operations, cit "The plant will come on line because it is there --- it is just a question of when," said Fredrick L. Lisman, who was Milford's mayor when the plant was first proposed in the late 1990's.
In Meriden, Mayor Mark D. Benigni said, "Obviously we have a pretty enormous structure out there that you can see from just about anywhere in the city, and we want to make sure that that structure generates the tax revenue we were promised."
Milford did not provide any tax abatements to woo the plant. Meriden signed a long-term tax payment plan with the developer that would provide a steady revenue stream, eliminating fluctuations from reassessment and property depreciation.
Both the Meriden and the Milford projects began as a joint venture of the Power Development Comany of Boston and the El Paso Energy Corporation of Houston, but the Meriden project was sold in 2001 to NRG Energy, the power-generating subsidiary of XCel Energy, a Minnesota-based company. PDC-El Paso set a May 2002 start date for operation. NRG planned to start operating this summer. 
Neither plant is meeting its deadline. Construction stopped in May on the Meriden project, which is less than half way done. The Milford plant is near completion, but has no start date, according to the state board that regulates power plant construction.
Mortimer A. Gelston, chairman of the Connecticut Siting Council, said PDC-El Paso informed the council that the operation of the Milford plant is delayed because of lawsuits related to a February 2000 construction accident in which two workers died and a third was seriously injured. A special state court for complex litigation is hearing the cases. 
"We need that plant on-line -- I did not certify that plant to have it go through all these problems,' said Mr. Gelston, who is proposing that the council pull the plant's certification to operate if it is not running by next month.
A media representative for the Milford project, Ann Baldwin, declined to comment on the lawsuit, the delay in operation or the plant's future.
Meriden is dealing with a different situation -- the prospect that NRG, its developer, will file for bankruptcy.
Work stopped on the Meriden plant in May because NRG could not secure financing to pay for construction. Lesa Bader, a company spokeswoman, said NRG attributed the difficulties to the decline in investor confidence due to the California energy crisis and the collapse of the Enron Corporation. This is coupled with an overall downturn in the economy and a decline in the credit ratings of power companies due to a drop in the price of electricity.
"NRG believes that Meriden is a good project and continues to pursue efforts to see that it is built," Ms. Bader said. "We view the current situation as temporary." 
The Meriden City Council recently hired Braith Kelly, an energy consultant, and discussed buying the plant, completing it and collecting the profits from the sale of electricity. The idea drew little support because of the cost, risk and complexity, so officials are now looking to Mr. Kelly to find other ways the city can ensure the plant is completed.
"We are trying to explore what is available to the city to keep the project alive," said Stephen T. Zerio, City Council majority leader and a member of a committee monitoring the plant's progress.
Local officials said they believed NRG will sell the plant. "I think it is only a matter of moments before NRG is officially bankrupt," Mr. Benigni said. "Because the plant is approximately 40 percent built, I do think another buyer will come in and take over the power plant. My concern is for that purchase being sooner rather than later Ms. Bader, the NRG spokeswoman, said the company was working to restructure. Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy is only one of the options being considered. The plant would be sold if an appropriate offer is made, she added.
Because of these uncertainties, the chairman of Meriden's Finance Committee Chairman, Brian F. Kogut, said he was hesitant to draw up a budget that relied on the tax payment due from NRG next year because of the uncertainties.
Rick Terrill, former chairman of the Meriden Conservation Commission, said he feared the plant will become an eyesore and burden on the city like the abandon factories left from Meriden's heyday as an industrial city.
But besides power plants, no other company or industry that delivers this much tax revenue is looking to move to Milford or Meriden, elected officials said.
"It is tough to bring manufacturing anywhere in the state of Connecticut," said Mr. Lisman, Milford's former mayor. "You don't have the big taxpayers you wish for." 
Mr. Zerio, the Meriden city councilor, pointed to the fact NRG will donate 790 acres of undeveloped land to the city and Berlin, a neighboring town, if the plant is completed. 
There are other advantages to power plants, Mr. Gelston, the siting council chairman, said, in comparison to other industries. They use few city services, bring little additional traffic and do not require hundreds of employees whose children crowd city schools. For example, the Meriden plant if complete will have an estimated 20 employees. Power plants are being considered in other communities such as Middletown and New Britain.
"It is a good industry," Mr. Gelston said.
Milford and Meriden are still deciding on whether this is true.

HEADLINE: Southampton Hospital Explores Merger 

BYLINE:  By JULIA C. MEAD

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON 

 BODY:
TO put Southampton Hospital on a firmer financial footing, its directors are talking with the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, and the New York Presbyterian Healthcare System, two of the nation's largest hospital organizations, about joining one of them. 
 Southampton's financial problems have been persistent. In the latest round, it has cut $3.6 million from its budget and has eliminated 49 jobs, about 6 percent of its work force. The latest cuts pale in comparison to $50 million in losses over a period of about three years in the late 1990's at the South Fork's only hospital. 
 Southampton has 168 beds and about 720 employees, making it the South Fork's largest private employer. Since 1996, it has been a partner in the Peconic Health Corporation, along with Central Suffolk Hospital in Riverhead and Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport.
Southampton is also affiliated with North Shore, a conglomerate of 18 hospitals on Long Island and in New York City, including North Shore University Hospital and the Long Island Jewish Medical Center. Affiliation is a rather loose agreement to share resources like computer software but not clinical services.
As for a merger, Annette Leahy, Southampton's new chief executive, said, "It is premature to say what will happen, but we are optimistic."
Terry Lynam, North Shore's corporate director of public relations, said that the merger talks began too recently to predict whether they would lead to a complete takeover or to a sponsorship, which would give the hospital some local control. A takeover would dissolve Southampton's board and put North Shore in control. Sponsorship would leave the board in place but would permit a greater sharing of North Shore's resources, resulting in more economy-of-scale savings.
"Southampton Hospital is attractive because it would give us a greater presence on eastern Long Island," Mr. Lynam said. Because Southampton has no competitors on the South Fork, it is an attractive target, both for the number of prospective patients in the area and the number of wealthy prospective donors. 
Mr. Lynam added that North Shore was interested in discussing mergers with Central Suffolk and Eastern Long Island, too, but was talking seriously with only Southampton so far. 
"We have a track record for turning around financially troubled hospitals," he said. Staten Island University Hospital's finances have been stabilized since North Shore became its sponsor, he said, and most of its sponsored hospitals operate in the black. The North Shore system reported a $79 million profit last year. 
Five years ago, North Shore and Southampton had discussed a merger but ended up as affiliates when North Shore balked at Southampton's debt. 
New York Presbyterian is even larger than North Shore. Its umbrella covers 35 member hospitals, nursing homes and medical centers in New York City, New Jersey and Connecticut, and it is affiliated with both Columbia and Cornell Universities. 
Myrna Manners, New York Presbyterian's vice president for public affairs, said that officials there "routinely have meetings" with other hospitals to discuss possible mergers. She confirmed that Southampton was one of them but added that "no concrete plans" had been made.
Ms. Leahy, North Shore's chief executive, said the layoffs and other spending cuts would save $3.6 million in this year's $79 million budget. The staff cuts will save $2 million, she said, and other cost-cutting measures, including closing the hospital's coffee shop, would save $1.6 million.
Earlier this month, 25 full-time and 14 part-time employees were laid off, and money for 10 vacant positions was eliminated from the budget. The layoffs include clinical workers in the breast health, cardiac rehabilitation, and pain management centers; a social worker; three lab workers; three medical or surgical staff members; five nursing administrators; and two emergency room employees. 
The 10 eliminated positions included those in the laboratory, radiology department and dialysis center. 
Ms. Leahy said that the budget shortfall stemmed from unexpected factors. She listed the nationwide nursing shortage, which makes the hospital more dependent on temporary employees supplied by agencies, and higher-than-expected costs for malpractice insurance, employee benefits and medical supplies.
Because of its location, the South Fork is a difficult place to recruit workers, she said, so the hospital has had raise some salaries to compete.
"None of this has any connection to the past," she said. "We now we find ourselves in increasingly challenging times. We have to consider something more substantive."
Ms. Leahy insisted the staff reductions would not affect patient care because the laid-off workers' duties would be "re-engineered," meaning that they would be redistributed among remaining employees. "We hope between that and increased revenue we will break even this year," Ms. Leahy said.
Government and civic leaders, concerned over the hospital's financial problems, said they would support a merger. 
Jay Schneiderman, the Town of East Hampton supervisor, said: "This hospital is absolutely critical to this community. I would not have a problem with ownership by a larger system because the hospital must do what it takes to survive."
Ann Kellett, the chairwoman of the town's health-care advisory committee and a former nursing professor at Columbia University, said a merger might be a special benefit for Medicaid recipients, who are now served by too few specialists. "A clinical affiliation with a larger system could attract more" specialists, Ms. Kellett said. "And it could also bring more services, innovative methodologies, quality measurements and continuing education. I can only see benefits in it."
James Needham, a former Southampton Town Board member who had been sharply critical of the hospital's financial problems in the 1990's, said of the latest financial problems: "I'm very upset. Everybody is. After all, this hospital is all we've got between Montauk Point and Stony Brook."

HEADLINE: Lawyers Move On; Power Balance Shifts 

BYLINE:  By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
IN one of the larger recent power shifts among top Long Island law firms, a team of six lawyers have moved their entire corporate litigation and bankruptcy practice from the Island's largest law firm to one of its most high-profiled. 
 "It's a monumental move," said Barry R. Shapiro, who heads the team that moved from Rivkin Radler in Uniondale to Meyer, Suozzi, English & Klein in Mineola. "I can't remember another group with our degree of billings and name recognition that has moved on Long Island." 
 Stephen W. Schlissel, a lawyer at Schlissel, Ostrow, Karabatos, Poepplein, Sender & Fisher in Garden City, said, that moves of this sort may become more common. "There are a number of firms on Long Island that are getting larger, and as they do the practice of moving between firms that exists in places like New York City will occur more and more here." 
Mr. Shapiro said his group generated $3 million in billings last year. Departing with him were Erica Garay, Jill Rosen Nikolaff, Howard B. Kleinberg, Stella Lellos and Robert Howard, along with a paralegal and four secretaries. Ms. Garay, Ms. Nikolaff and Mr. Kleinberg were partners at Rivkin Radler; they plus Mr. Shapiro have been made partners at Meyer, Suozzi.
Laurie J. Bloom, Rivkin Radler's director of marketing and communication, said the departed team's income was actually about $2 million and that it was 15 percent less than in 2001. 
The managing partner at Meyer, Suozzi, Lois Carter Schlissel, who is not related to Stephen Schlissel, said her firm had been speaking with the Shapiro team for "a long time, and it became clear to us two months ago that this is a perfect match."
Their defection of the Shapiro group follows the May 2001 departure of another high-profile Rivkin Radler partner, Arthur Kremer, former chairman of the New York State Assembly Ways and Means Committee. 
Among the well-known partners in the Meyer, Suozzi firm are John V.N. Klein, the former Suffolk county executive; Harold Ickes, former White House deputy chief of staff in the Clinton administration; and Joseph Suozzi, the former Glen Cove mayor and father of the Nassau county executive, Thomas R. Suozzi. 
Jerry Reisman of the firm of Reisman Peirez & Reisman in Garden City said that moves of the magnitude of the Shapiro group's have been occurring among law firms in Manhattan for the last 15 years. "It's relatively new on Long Island because there are few large firms here," he said. 
A week after the Shapiro team moved, William M. Savino, the managing partner of Rivkin Ralder, announced that William Cornachio of Manhasset and Walter J. Gumersell of Lloyd Neck had rejoined his firm as partners, and that Dara A.L. Coope of New Hyde Park had joined as an associate. 
The recent additions brought the firm back up to about 135 lawyers, according to Mr. Savino. Rivkin Radler is by far the largest firm on the Island. Meyer, Suozzi, with 63 lawyers, is among the Island's top five largest firms.
"The move wasn't driven by economics," Mr. Shapiro insisted. "It was driven by a belief that there was a shared vision between us and the people at Meyer, Suozzi about how to grow a law firm, reach out to new clients and give back to the community. Meyer, Suozzi has deep roots on Long Island and wants to grow on Long Island, which is very important to us."
But Mr. Reisman dismissed such talk as nothing but a "public relations statement."
"The purpose of moves is money," he said. "When they say it's not about money, it's about money."

HEADLINE: EDUCATION; 
The Man Who Turned Manhattanville Around

BYLINE:  By YILU ZHAO 

DATELINE: PURCHASE 

 BODY:
BEFORE Richard A. Berman's arrival at Manhattanville College here in 1995, the college, with less than $1 million in endowment, was losing more than $3 million a year. Its dorms, designed to hold 1,500 students, were more than half empty. It rarely turned down any applicant. With the college strapped for cash and defaulting on bonds, its buildings were falling apart. 
 Everybody agrees he has turned the college around, and though Mr. Berman did not wave a magic wand, it almost seems as if he did, longtime faculty and staff members say. Now the liberal arts college has an enrollment of 1,470, more than twice the 660 it had in 1995. Its acceptance rate is 55 percent. It has balanced its books, stopped selling its land and is paying back its debts on schedule. And more important to both its faculty and students alike, it has earned a spot among the top tier of northern American colleges ranked by U.S. News & World Report and found its way into at least three college guide books popular among high school students. Tuition at Manhattanville is $20,600 per year; it has increased less than 5 percent each year. 
 "People are constantly talking about how President Berman saved the school," said Vladimir Estiverne, a senior at Manhattanville and the vice president of its student government.
So how did hedo it? Members of his staff say he worked hard, he listened to students and people on his staff, and he knew the economics of higher education.
Mr. Berman, an energetic former management consultant of McKinsey & Company and former executive of New York University Medical Center, did not shrink from what he felt he had to do.
"We needed to save money wherever we could," he said. The first thing he did was to fire about 15 administrative staff members. Then he made everybody who stayed -- from faculty members to maintenance workers -- do more. Professors started to teach eight courses a year instead of six. Building staff workers painted the walls of the new dance studios and the photography labs. 
Mr. Berman, who lives on campus with his wife, Jean, has toiled alongside his employees, often putting in 16-hour days -- from 8 in the morning until midnight -- at the college. He has attended almost every sports event and student play, and he now knows three-quarters of the students by name. "My wife attends a lot of these events, too," he said, "so she can see me more." 
He promised every professor a pay raise of up to 60 percent as soon as the school's fiscal health improved. "That promise was fulfilled," Mr. Berman said. The starting salary for a faculty member, for instance, jumped to about $40,000 from around $25,000. As part of his duties, Mr. Berman sought out companies that could help the college. He went to MasterCard, which has a large campus in Purchase, for its old computers so that the college could build its first computer lab in 1995. He entreated a technology company to install modems and computer networks on campus and a utility company to replace its defunct boilers on credit He wooed Mary Corrarino, a Manhattanville graduate who had been a partner at a large Wall Street law firm, to join the college as its senior vice president, overseeing all nonacademic affairs. 
"Richard called me and asked whether I would consider working for Manhattanville," Ms. Corrarino recalled. "I said, 'Absolutely not.' But four months later, I was working for him." 
To turn around an ailing college is not easy. The market has not been kind to small private colleges without the brand name recognition and large endowment of, say, Williams or Amherst. Almost all experts on the economics of higher education agree that small regional colleges have been losing students to cheaper public institutions for years. Studies show that high school graduates today are less inclined to choose small regional colleges because of family or religious affiliations. The prospective students also tend to demand state-of-the-art facilities -- swanky gyms and fast computers -- that small schools cannot afford.
More than a half-dozen such colleges in the Northeast have shut their doors since 1995, including Notre Dame College in New Hampshire and Bradford College in Massachusetts. 
Manhattanville could have been one of them. The school had sold 150 of its 250 acres of land by 1995 to keep its door open as its enrollment eroded. Because the college lacked a large endowment, its finances are driven by tuition, which pays for 90 percent of operating expenses. In 1994, the faculty, already poorly paid, agreed to take a 6 percent salary decrease to help put a stop to the school's decline.
Now to many faculty and alumni, the appearance of Mr. Berman, who had been hired to search for a president for the school but was hired instead, seems like a miracle.
He has been, above all, a superb salesman. Knowing the importance to increase enrollment, he has traveled to cities like Detroit and Chicago to speak in high schools to extol the chief virtue of a small liberal arts college like Manhattanville: the caring intimacy that fosters growth and learning. He took out radio and newspaper advertisements in urban centers in California and Illinois. He has hired students to place more than 10,000 calls every year to applicants to sell the school. He touts the way the college has transformed inner city teenagers and catapulted a few of them into Yale Medical School, Cornell Law School and the Juilliard School. Backslapping and prone to hugging students and staff members alike, he demonstrated an enthusiasm that has been contagious.
With cash trickling in from gradually increased enrollment, Mr. Berman has installed Internet connections in every dorm, built a computer lab with the latest computers, renovated the gymnasium, converted the library catalog to an electronic database and sent students on trips to Nepal, Senegal and Mexico. 
But he has also made other small changes. The student dining hall serves, in addition to the regular fare of burgers and other sandwiches, sushi and Indian stew. The library stays open until 4 a.m. every day. He has opened a convenience store on campus that sells snacks and daily necessities.
"Look, it's not more expensive to make sushi than greasy food that nobody will eat," he said, giving the confident smile that many said is his trademark. "You just need to listen to the kids."

 Times have been difficult at the Wadsworth Atheneum ("Resignations and Turmoil at the Atheneum," Jan. 12), but already the smoke is clearing. The museum's new director will find a Board of Trustees eager help the expansion program move forward. With half the money raised despite the troubled economy, a sense of optimism is not unwarranted. Let us hope that time, and a firm commitment to the Atheneum and its goals from the public and the Board, will help put the missteps permanently in the past.

HEADLINE: Too Much Spending In the Wrong Places 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re: "How Did Such a Rich State Get So Poor?" (Dec. 22, 2002).
 The problem behind the crumbling finances in Connecticut is not that taxes are too low; the problem is that many unnecessary expenditures have been allowed during the flush times of the past. 
 Connecticut needs a Hoover Commission to examine state government organization and expenditures. If unnecessary expenditures were eliminated, the state could probably abolish its income tax and gain competitive advantage by attracting more companies. 
For example, Connecticut could save substantial sums of money by combining its two separate systems of higher education into one system and eliminating duplicate administrative costs. The mission of the state university could be refocused upon education and millions more saved without harming educational services by eliminating Division I basketball and football teams with their high-priced coaches, and many other expenditures for entertainment provided by big-time sports that are unrelated to higher education. Combining or eliminating unnecessary state expenditures and lowering taxes would do much to invigorate the state's economy.

To the Editor:
 After reading this article, I wondered if Fred V. Carstensen, the director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, lives in the same state I do. 
According to Mr. Carstensen, the state is doing moderately well both regionally and nationally on an economic level. 
 I was laid off from a good-paying job as a graphic designer 17 months ago. I have still not found full-time work in Connecticut. My current unemployment claim will run out soon. Economic analysts and demographic experts may see this as a rich state with budgetary problems. As a highly skilled resident who cannot find a job, I find Connecticut to be a state in economic depression.

 GREAT NECK
By Jay Cantor.
703 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $27.95.
 To call Jay Cantor the thinking man's Tom Wolfe is a little unfair to Tom Wolfe, who surely believes, and with some justification, that he's the thinking man's Tom Wolfe. It's also a little unfair to Jay Cantor, who for all I know abhors Wolfe's politics and his fiction as well. Yet the scope of Cantor's ambition in his teeming new novel, "Great Neck"; his avid desire to capture the American scene entire; his crowd of characters, each absorbed in a private drama; certain thrillingly compact episodes that stand out like a prodigy among dull schoolkids; the hankering after abandoned tradition (Cantor is fascinated by the cabala, Wolfe by the Stoics); the stern morality operating just below the surface of the narrative -- all these things, it seems to me, link these two writers, both of whom ardently believe in the power of fiction to bring an American moment to life.
If I were one of Jay Cantor's characters (and it's occurred to me that maybe I am: privileged, half Jewish, shadowed by the Holocaust, guilty about the dark side of America's past) and thought that my Wolfe-Cantor comparison was unfair, I'd indulge in several dozen pages of tortured introspection, a succession of brilliant, obsessive, Freud-haunted scenes staged entirely in the mind's theater. This kind of strenuous broody thinking explains why "Great Neck," though in other respects an impressively economical panorama of two decades in the life of America, from the civil rights era to Vietnam, from nonviolent antiwar protest to the Black Panthers and the Weathermen, stretches to 703 pages and often feels, I'm sorry to say, bloated. 
Can a novel be both economical and bloated? Some writers worry about how to get a character down the stairs and out the door -- not Cantor. He's a minimalist when it comes to stage directions and decor. A few deft touches, and there you are, an earnest Long Island teenage boy named Jesse at a fund-raising party for a civil rights organization, wandering through a Long Island ranch house with "colorful paintings covering the walls" ("painted Cokes and targets") and suddenly standing next to -- Andy Warhol! Two quick sentences is all it takes to fix Andy to the page: "Odd white hair, and the palest skin Jesse had ever seen. He looked smaller than the photos of him, like he might break." But Cantor is definitely a maximalist when it comes to covering emotional ground, especially the spasm of conscience. Can there be another novel in which a character engaged in armed robbery, with shooting and dying going on around her -- the action sketched with taut precision -- stops to ponder the true nature of her guilt? She hasn't, she decides, provided adequate child care for her 2-year-old daughter.
There are more than a dozen characters in "Great Neck" who regularly come in for full head scans; it's as though Cantor required a detailed topographical survey of someone's psyche -- anyone's psyche -- on every other page. The key players, all exhaustively mapped, are six teenagers, four boys and two girls, bound together by a tragedy and its eerie aftermath: the older brother of Laura, one of the girls in the group, is killed by the Klan in Mississippi, where he has gone in 1964 to register black voters. Though dead, Frank apparently continues sending letters to Beth, his girlfriend, the other girl in the group. 
The letters from beyond the grave are not just spooky, they're life-altering, mostly because one of the boys, Billy -- the artist in the group -- convinces the rest that he's in touch with Frank by some extrasensory means (he announces Frank's death a day before anyone could possibly know of it: "He's already dead. . . . I don't know how I know, I just do. They've murdered him and buried him under tons of earth"). Billy also announces that these posthumous letters spell out their mission in life: "We have to, like, keep Frank in our hearts and do acts of justice." He goads them on by creating an instantly popular comic-book series (it soon acquires a huge cult following) in which the six friends are transformed into crusading superheroes. Thus they lead their lives in the shadow of bright, seductive, two-dimensional alter egos engaged in the Zap! Kapow! of cartoon heroics. (You could say that Billy flattens his friends; Cantor, with his ceaseless psychological probing, restores depth and heft.)
Because he was murdered while serving the cause of civil rights, and because he communicates with them after death (or so it seems), Frank connects this bunch of pampered suburban kids to something "much larger than Great Neck." They feel doubly chosen. They're ripe for the late 60's and the turbulent passions of the campus antiwar movement. Cantor threads his gang of six through the maze of the decade's social and political issues (he even cruises New York's avant-garde, pausing to take in S-and-M clubs and the nascent vogue for performance art). All but one of the Great Neck crew is engaged in radical protest against the war; several gradually relinquish their allegiance to nonviolence. Beth graduates from S.D.S. to the Weather Underground -- that is, she embraces violence wholeheartedly and masterminds a series of bombings (all loosely based, like much of this novel, on actual events). Except for her, every member of the group abandons activism in the 70's to pursue more or less mainstream careers. By the early 80's, when the novel ends, their revolutionary ardor has all but died, yet Beth's still burns: though she worries that "guilt, like a sticky syrup, would slow her reflexes," one final flare of action rounds off the narrative. (In Billy's comics, Beth is Ninja B., or Deborah, a k a the Prophet or Athena X, relentless foe of the forces of evil.)
If your brother is killed by the Klan (Cantor makes us intimate with both black and white versions of that particular sorrow), it's a local manifestation of the wider historical tragedy of Jim Crow -- and behind that, the indelible stain of slavery. Alongside these New World horrors lies Europe's monstrous 20th-century equivalent. There are two Holocaust survivors in the novel (one of them Beth's psychoanalyst father, perhaps Cantor's most melancholy creation) and many victims of American racism, including, memorably, a Delta bluesman-turned-preacher who is beaten along with his wife -- while his church burns -- because he has urged his congregation to vote. For the Great Neck gang, man's inhumanity to man begins with Auschwitz and only later encompasses Parchman prison farm; they may have it backward chronologically, but at least the past means something to them. Cantor is adept at summoning history (a rapid glimpse, say, of Malcolm X in Ghana, "admonitory, precise," sipping tea and dispensing homilies in a bar in Accra), and even better at showing historical consciousness at work, claiming its role in the psychic drama along with guilt and lust and petty self-regard and the barter economy of moral reckoning.
If you want to "do acts of justice" in an unjust world, circa 1969, how do you go about it? "Great Neck" provides at least a dozen answers, each one plausible to the character who dreams it up. Laura's boyfriend, a physics prodigy at M.I.T., tripping on acid, whispers to her that he doesn't care if he dies in a demo -- because if I can't help stop them killing Vietnamese, I feel like I'll have to kill myself." Cantor convinces us that you wouldn't need LSD to feel something similar: a student in that torrid climate -- race riots, serial assassination, napalmed villages, the daily body count -- could easily find the role of nonviolent warrior too tame. For Beth, who lumps American imperialism with "the death camps that had nearly killed her father," passive resistance is tantamount to the acquiescence of the "good German." That may sound extreme, but there's a fabulous abundance in "Great Neck" of serious argument about how to combat establishment evil -- and some spectacular demonstrations of how the battle can go awry. (There's also, for my taste, too much reliance on Billy's comic books as a fantasy counterpoint to the daily struggle.)
Cantor's first book, "The Death of Che Guevara" (1983), another huge novel, was a channeling of that revolutionary icon; his second, "KrazyKat" (1988), was a brilliant high modernist riff on the great comic strip -- both books, sadly, are out of print. "Great Neck," a surprising amalgam of its predecessors, is so rich in character and incident that you can't help wishing it a long shelf life and many devoted readers. Overflowing with brainpower -- as though all the minds Cantor investigates were somehow networked and engaged in furious serial processing -- it finds room for heart, too. It is, after all, a novel about friends.

 20:21 VISION
Twentieth-Century Lessons
for the Twenty-First Century.
By Bill Emmott.
373 pp. New York:
Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $25.
 "THE hunt for humbugs is one of the basic purposes of journalism, the quintessentially paranoid profession," Bill Emmott writes in "20:21 Vision," a provocative and thoughtful survey of global trends at the beginning of the 21st century. Emmott, the editor in chief of The Economist and the author of several previous books, finds plenty of humbugs to hunt.
This is really two books: one about geopolitics, the other about geoeconomics. In the first section, "Peace Challenged," Emmott examines, in succeeding chapters, "American Leadership," "Chinese Ambition," "Japanese Vulnerability," "European Envy" and "Turbulence and Terror." He predicts that "American leadership will persist, and offers a crucial hope to the rest of the world," though he qualifies his prediction by allowing for the possibility of American unilateralism or isolation. 
If a challenge does come to American military primacy, it may come from China. Emmott writes, "It is a mark of the way in which the terror attacks gripped the imagination and concentrated minds that China suddenly seemed a much less important challenger on 12 September than it had just a day or two earlier." According to Emmott, however, "terrorism can be contained, even if it cannot be entirely quelled." For this reason, he argues, "the pundits were right to put China high on their lists of possible challenges, and nothing that happened in the autumn of 2001 changed that." He is particularly concerned about a Chinese-American conflict over Taiwan: "If there is ever a fight between the United States and China, it is likely to arise from what would be the greatest and most fateful miscalculation in the history of mankind."
Adding to the tension in East Asia is what Emmott calls the increasing "vulnerability" of Japan: "A more nationalist government, a more powerful navy and air force, a more visible military presence in the region, even, in the end, a publicly acknowledged program of nuclear research and development: all these must be considered likelihoods for Japan during the first few decades of the 21st century." The crisis triggered by North Korea's acquisition of nuclear weapons, which began after the book went to print, makes Emmott's speculation about proliferation in East Asia look prescient.
Since its founding in the 19th century, The Economist has been identified with free-market liberalism, and it comes as no surprise that the second section of Emmott's book, "Capitalism Questioned," might as well have been titled "Capitalism Defended." But Emmott's defense is a nuanced one.
He points out that many people in the West and around the world, as well as in Marxist-Leninist countries, not only have believed that there was a coherent system called "capitalism" but have despised it in each of its historical forms, from the small, proprietary business to the impersonal, multinational corporation. In successive chapters, Emmott examines the objections that capitalism is (to cite the chapter titles), "Unpopular," "Unstable," "Unequal" and "Unclean." While he leaves no doubts about his own views, his defense of market economics is far more measured than the triumphalist manifestoes that conservatives, libertarians and even some liberals have issued in recent years. To cite one instance: "These are the bleak facts. Inequality between countries has increased rather than diminished, over a long period. . . . And some countries in sub-Saharan Africa have in fact become poorer in absolute terms."
Emmott has little trouble showing that much of the conventional criticism of "globalization" is inspired by sentimentality or bad data. For example, he demonstrates that "the comparison of companies' size to countries' G.D.P. is wholly misleading, not to say economically illiterate. . . . The correct way of comparing companies and national economies would be by comparing value added in both cases. . . . That, though, would make even the biggest companies look puny compared with all but the tiniest economies." 
He is less persuasive, however, when he offers his own formula for economic growth in developing countries. Emmott appears to concede a considerable amount when he writes: "This is not, to repeat, an argument for raw laissez-faire, anything-goes economies or societies. . . . Economic freedom is a broad concept which seems to require a great deal from government if it is to prevail and to work its living-standard-enhancing magic." But he immediately makes it clear that his ideal is still the classical liberal night-watchman state: "Government needs to set a clear, predictable regulatory and macroeconomic climate: protecting property rights, enforcing the law, avoiding inflation and, just as important, not taking all the money for itself." As valuable as this advice is, in all successful capitalist societies government has played a far more active role -- for example, by building expensive infrastructures for transport, energy and sanitation; by using tariff or nontariff barriers or subsidies to foster entire industries; and by subsidizing scientific and technological research and development. 
IN some of his previous books, Emmott criticized what he viewed as exaggerated claims for East Asian versions of capitalism, in which the state played a major role. It seems odd, therefore, that his discussion of economic development is not accompanied by a comparison of the different paths followed by countries that have successfully industrialized. 
Still, one need not share Emmott's version of classical liberalism to appreciate his call in his final chapter for "paranoid optimism." The saving strength of historical liberalism, in thought as well as practice, has been its resistance to totalizing systems -- including totalizing liberal systems. "What the 20th century showed, throughout its span, was that man's ability to take control of economic, social and political forces is severely limited. And the biggest human, economic and even environmental disasters occurred when people came to believe that they had discovered all the answers to the question of what needed to be done."

Now That You've Asked...

BYLINE:  By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
WE'VE been surveyed again, and, as usual, we have come out sounding just a bit daft. According to this new survey, we think things are dreadful economically, we think our governor is a misfit, and yet a disturbing number of us are optimistic about the year ahead. Go, as they say, figure.
 The survey, whose results were released Jan. 24, is the work of the PublicMind research center at Fairleigh Dickinson University. The surveyors asked 801 of us questions like, "In the next 12 months do you expect to increase the unpaid balance on your credit card?" From the answers, assorted conclusions were drawn, among them that 93 percent of us did not buy or build a house last year, that even many members of his own party are not terribly comfortable with Governor McGreevey, and that lots of us do not seem to know how to take a decent vacation. 
 On the economic side, many of us feel that we personally and the business climate in general are worse off than a year ago, yet many of us also think that we and it will be better 12 months hence. Perhaps that's simply our way of saying that things couldn't possibly get any more glum than they are now. 
On the other hand, perhaps it's our way of saying that we don't pay much attention to the news. Does the phrase "looming $5 billion state budget deficit" ring a bell?
Polls like this one, while useful in that they give university institutes something to do, tend not to ask quite enough questions; they'll begin an intriguing line of inquiry but stop short of the one question that will allow the survey and those answering it to make sense. Let's close that gap right now. First, a question the folks at PublicMind did ask, then the question they should have asked next:
1. Do you think that a year from now you (and your family living there) will be better off financially, or worse? (Results: better, 48 percent; same, 20 percent; worse, 22 percent.)
1a. Do you think that within the next 12 months red oaks, New Jersey's state trees, will begin sprouting $20 gold pieces instead of acorns?
2. In the next 12 months do you expect to visit an Atlantic City casino? (Results: yes, 28 percent; no, 66 percent.)
2a. In the next 12 months do you expect to try to tunnel into the vault of an Atlantic City casino? 
3. In the past year did you go away on vacation for a week or more? (Results: yes, 49 percent; no, 51 percent.)
3a. In the past year were you ordered to take a permanent vacation by your now-bankrupt employer?
4. In the next 12 months do you expect to buy or lease a car? (Yes, 21 percent; no, 75 percent.)
4a. In the next 12 months do you expect to buy or lease the "Talking Pedometer," which came advertised in this month's Macy's bill? This apparently is a device that talks to you while you run, walk or jog. Does the idea of having an electronic voice hound you while you're exercising ("Move it, thunder thighs!") appeal to you? 
4b. Do you expect to be doing a lot more running, walking or jogging in the next 12 months because you can't afford gas, your car will have been repossessed and/or the roads won't be safe to drive on because the state doesn't have enough money to fill the pot holes?
4c. Were you able to pay this month's Macy's bill?
5. Do you think Governor McGreevey's policies have helped or hurt the New Jersey economy? Would that be somewhat or a lot? (Results: helped a lot, 4 percent; helped somewhat, 16 percent; hurt somewhat, 23 percent; hurt a lot, 18 percent.)
5a. If your name is McGreevey, do you think that a few years from now you will be looking for work?
6. In the past year did you purchase stocks or other types of investments outside your pension plan? (Result: yes, 28 percent; no, 71 percent.)
6a. Speaking specifically to the 28 percent: What are you, nuts?
7. In the next 12 months do you expect to buy a computer? (Results: yes, 21 percent; no, 75 percent.)
7a. In the next 12 months do you expect to boil your computer in a soup pot along with a few potatoes and maybe some red acorns?
8. In the next 12 months do you expect to purchase an airline ticket for a pleasure trip? (Results: yes, 44 percent; no, 52 percent.)
8a. If yes, will this be a one-way ticket?

Is McGreevey Squeezing Until Everyone Yells 'Taxes'?

 BODY:
They come out of the governor's office shaking their heads, sputtering predictions of apocalypse, insisting that it can't be true. 
And at some point -- after they have gone through those stages of grief, denial, anger -- maybe they pick up a phone and get to work, doing precisely what Governor McGreevey hopes they'll do: start demanding higher taxes to make the pain go away.
 Mr. McGreevey has been warning for some time that he has to find a way to close a deficit of more than $5 billion in the budget. But rather than dropping the bomb about who will suffer cuts -- the mayors, the schools, the colleges -- when he delivers his budget address on Tuesday, Mr. McGreevey has been skillfully dribbling out the bad news piecemeal to the various interest groups who can be counted on to scream the loudest. 
 He told the public employees that there would be "universal pain and layoffs." He told the four-year public colleges and the universities that they would have to eat a 10 percent cut in their state allotment, on top of last year's cut. On Wednesday, the governor, in effect, told 16,000 low-income elderly residents that they would have to pay more for their state-subsidized prescriptions. And just to make sure the message got home, he told the drug companies, New Jersey's high-tech pride and joy, the same thing.
Is he just being nice, breaking the news personally, like a solicitous doctor? Or is there a plan at work here?
Thirteen years ago, another Jim in the governor's office, also a Democrat, was faced with a similar problem. Jim Florio's deficit was only $500 million ($688 million today when adjusted for inflation) compared with Jim McGreevey's $5 billion. In what has since become a cautionary tale that grandparents recite to budding politicians from one end of the state to the other, Mr. Florio seized the deficit by the horns along with any number of other pressing problems facing the state after eight years of Republican neglect, wrapped them all up in a $2.8 billion tax increase. He rammed it through the Legislature, and then saw his own career and those of many other Democrats thrown into the outer darkness by the fury that followed.
"We live in a state with a funny media environment, where it is difficult for even a governor to explain himself," said David Rebovich, a political science professor at Rider University. "Whether Florio did a good job or not, the citizens simply didn't get it."
While Dr. Rebovich was writing columns in The Trentonian praising Mr. Florio's courage in trying to solve the state's fiscal problems in a single bold gesture, the Republicans sharpened their knives, and Mr. Florio's fate was sealed.
"For better or worse, the failure of his tax policy was largely attributable to a communications failure," Dr. Rebovich said, "and whatever Jim McGreevey has up his sleeve, he's doing a darn good job of communicating."
Governor McGreevey has already boxed himself in on tax increases since he declared on any number of occasions that the three biggest revenue producers -- income taxes, sales taxes and corporate business taxes -- were out of bounds for increases. 
Yet members of his party leadership have begun talking about a surtax on the wealthy, just as Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut, a Republican who faces a much smaller deficit, has discussed an income tax surcharge on incomes exceeding $1 million. 
New Jersey Democrats, being Democrats, are apparently talking about putting the surcharge on the income of working stiffs earning as little as $200,000 or even $150,000.
So suppose the pressure for a tax increase to offset the cuts that Mr. McGreevey has spent the last few days describing in such gory detail should come from the grass roots? 
Suppose the college presidents and the transportation interests and the public employee unions and the 16,000 elderly prescription users were to pick up their phones and declare that the money to reduce the size of the cuts had to be raised somewhere else?
"I think he's laying the groundwork so that there might be a groundswell of support for a large revenue- raising measure," Dr. Rebovich said. "I don't think he's going to come out and say, 'Hey, I talked to the interest groups and they want me to raise taxes on the wealthy.' I think he is going to sit back and see who goes to editorial writers, who starts to hold rallies, who starts meeting with their legislative members. Then he can go to the Legislature and say, 'The people are demanding this!"'

HEADLINE: Back From the Edge 

BYLINE:  By JOHN RATHER

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON 

 BODY:
AFTER five years of study, a five-month moratorium on shoreline construction and a string of often-contentious public hearings, the Town of Southampton appears near to banning new bulkheads, steel walls, seawalls, rock revetments and other hardened erosion-control structures along its fabled ocean shores.
 The nearly total prohibition on shoreline armoring, a landmark step that would formally change longstanding policies of coastal management and property rights, is part of a larger scheme for a measured and orderly retreat from the coast backed by environmental groups and gaining support among New York State agencies and the Army Corps of Engineers, which has jurisdiction over the country's navigable waters and seashores. 
"We are going to severely restrict people from putting hardened structures in front of their homes," said Steven Kenny, the Southampton town councilman who introduced the proposal. "As part of the generally accepted coastal policy of strategic retreat, we are going to get homes as far back from the dunes and oceanfront as possible."
 The measure could become law in the town as early as March. But local property owners with deep pockets have mounted a determined effort to hold their ground, which is valued at hundreds of dollars per square foot, and an initial push to hasten their retreat has weakened even as the anti-armoring effort has advanced. 
 Backers of the Southampton move, which would be carried out in amendments to the town's Coastal Erosion Hazard Law, say a ban on shore hardening is necessary to preserve the town's Atlantic beaches, regarded by some as among the finest in the world.
 They said that in cases where beaches vanish and water reaches armoring, the public right of use and passage below mean high tide, guaranteed by law, is taken away. A colonial patent also grants town trustees an easement above the high-tide line.
 "In an eroding area, if you have a hardened structure, over time you will actually have theft," said Carolyn Zenk, a Southampton town councilwoman and an environmental lawyer who supports the measure.
 Areas affected by the proposed amendments would include ocean shorelines in the hamlets of Water Mill, Bridgehampton and Sagaponack and in unincorporated areas on the Westhampton barrier island. Shorefront property within incorporated villages, including Southampton, Quogue, Westhampton Beach and West Hampton Dunes, would not be restricted. 
 The amendments would put Southampton in the forefront of towns, cities and resort communities along the East Coast in setting policies that prevent shorefront property owners from throwing up walls against the sea. Many coastal experts say these structures, while protecting private property, end up obliterating beaches and causing erosion in adjoining areas.
 "We've learned our lesson -- they are a disaster," Ms. Zenk said. 
 Existing armoring would be allowed to remain, but could not be rebuilt if -- or when -- it is destroyed by storm or a rising sea level. The only exception would be for one type of temporary structure, long tubes filled with sand, that the town would permit for a maximum of nine months for emergency protection or while buildings are repaired and/or relocated farther from shore. 
 The tubing could not exceed six feet in height and would be intended to get a homeowner through one winter storm season only, after which the tubes would be cut open to release the sand. Owners would also be strongly encouraged and given incentives to move their homesback. 
 Owners of oceanfront homes and properties in Southampton seemed to be taking all this in stride. But they are vigorously contesting a second part of the amendments that would increase home setbacks from 100 feet to 150 feet behind dunes and in other ways regulate the use of their land. 
 They said the additional amendments trampled on their private property rights and in many cases would leave owners with too little room to rebuild or relocate if homes were damaged, destroyed or threatened by storm erosion. The amendments would expand regulation under the coastal erosion hazard law to areas inland of the dune and also restrict the clearing of natural vegetation.
 The owners also take offense at suggestions that they imperil the shore.
 "It's shockingly undemocratic," said John Bennett, a lawyer in Southampton for a group of about 15 oceanfront property owners. "These people are wonderful stewards of their land. You see them planting dune grass and putting up snow fences and building up the dunes. They are the true stakeholders. The town board members who are pushing this just don't get the East End culture." 
 The owners' lawyers and coastal experts say there is nothing in the town's five-year study of its coastlines that suggests increased setbacks would have any impact on coastal erosion. Indeed, the amendments have given new momentum to a simmering campaign to create a new Village of Dune Hampton out of a seven-mile-long oceanfront area from the eastern boundary of the Village of Southampton to the East Hampton town line. Such a village, like the others in the town, could impose its own shoreline regulations. 
 "We are looking to control our destiny in our little special area," said Stuart D. Baker, a member of the incorporation committee and an oceanfront owner, who said the committee would pursue incorporation regardless of what the town did. 
 Laura Hildreth, a consultant to the committee, said the town board had alienated itself from the owners. "They just don't trust the town board anymore because of the way that they have acted and the attitudes they have shown," she said. "They seem not to be advocates, but more the adversaries of the people on the beach."
 But to the surprise of supporters, the owners seem far less focused on the armoring ban, a signal of a general acceptance of the notion that private shore-hardening projects may be a thing of the past.
 "If this were just about hardened structures and clearing restrictions, the law would have passed already," Mr. Bennett said.
 Steven Kenny, the town coun-cilman who with Ms. Zenk advanced the amendments, said he made changes to provide incentives for owners to move homes farther from the beach and to ease proposed restrictions on setbacks on the inland side of properties. The changes will also make it easier for owners to rebuild homes.
 "We wanted to recognize property owners' pre-existing rights along the coastline," said Mr. Kenny, a professor of economics at Suffolk County Community College.
 Mr. Kenny, who spent summers on the ocean in what is now the highly developed Village of West Hampton Dunes while growing up in Freeport and Bay Shore, said that what he described as the suburbanization of ocean shore areas detracted from the town's heritage and natural beauty. "We are beginning to see lawns and tennis courts," he said. "There has been a trend in these beach areas of these looming structures right on the property line."
 Mr. Bennett, who lives and practices in Southampton, sees a different picture. "I have European clients who say what's so wonderful is that the beach is so lightly developed," he said.
 Mr. Kenny, a resident of Remsenburg since the mid-1970's, said he hoped for a meeting of the minds. "This is one of those classic public policy issues where the private interest comes into conflict with the public interest," he said. "And at the end of the day I am hoping that the property owners can share in preserving the natural beauty of the coastline."
 Mr. Kenny and Ms. Zenk, who is from Hampton Bays, now appear to have the support of the Town Board's swing vote, Dennis A. Suskind, a Democrat from Bridgehampton. Of the three, Mr. Suskind, a retired general partner in Goldman Sachs who lives in an oceanfront area, is the most connected to the affected property owners.
 In July, Mr. Suskind reluctantly joined the other Democrats, Mr. Kenny and Ms. Zenk, in approving a five-month moratorium on new construction in oceanfront areas within the town, provided it was not extended. The moratorium expired late last month.
 The board's two Republicans -- the town supervisor, Patrick Heaney, and Councilwoman Linda Kabot -- opposed the moratorium.
 Now Mr. Suskind is again in the swing position. After initially opposing the proposed amendments to the Coastal Erosion Hazard Law as "a little heavy on property rights," he said last week that the changes offered by Mr. Kenny had won his support.
 "As it is written now, except for little touch-ups, it accomplishes its goal of setting the stage for maintenance of our beaches as well as protecting the rights of people who built homes there over the last 50 years before we understood what was happening to the beaches," he said. 
 Mr. Suskind said he "basically embraced" coastal retreat. "On the other hand, you don't have to retreat to Ronkonkoma," he added. 
 Donna Giancontieri, an executive assistant to Mr. Heaney, said Mr. Heaney wanted to review the most recent changes in the amendments before commenting. Ms. Kabot did not return calls seeking comment.
 The backers have been warned that a fourth vote may be necessary. Mr. Bennett and other lawyers contend that a super-majority is needed because the amendments, though couched within the Coastal Erosion Hazard Law, amounted to zoning changes. Mr. Bennett said that when enough owners protested such a change, as he said they had, state law required the super-majority.
 Mr. Kenny said he believed he would get the fourth vote. But backers acknowledged that the amendments, even in softened form, were unwelcome among owners. "There are some people, I am sure, who would like this to go away forever," Ms. Zenk said. 
 Mr. Suskind said he had been repeatedly buttonholed. "People I have known for many years and some people I don't know have come to see me and said they don't want us to do anything," he said. "They say they will protect the beaches because they care about them. I believe them, but I don't think the town can just depend on 300 people doing what they think is right. And you also don't know who they are going to sell their house to."
 Six states -- Maine, Rhode Island, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Oregon -- have rules against armoring shorelines. But Orin Pilkey, a professor emeritus of earth and ocean sciences at Duke University in Durham, N.C., said exceptions made many of the restrictions ineffective.
 "Southampton is a community that has been trying to get to the bottom of this problem for many years," said Dr. Pilkey, an opponent of hardened structures. "I'm impressed with their toughness."
 Dr. Pilkey said sea level rise made retreat from the ocean shore inevitable over the next several generations. "We could either retreat in a planned and strategic fashion, or in tactical disarray in response to natural disasters," he said. "Of course, we can build massive walls that will hold the shoreline in place for a longer time, but then you won't have a beach." 
 Dr. Pilkey said he was not surprised that oceanfront owners in Southampton were paying more attention to setback requirements than a ban on armoring. "People on the shoreline in general are very shortsighted," he said. "The setback requirement is an obvious limitation to development. They won't get quite the same view of the sea, so that's an immediate problem." 
 Robert DeLuca, president of the Group for the South Fork, an environmental and planning organization, said the ban on armoring was the most meaningful part of the amendments. "From our standpoint, that's the primary objective," he said. "It is the strategy of getting out of the way of the ocean as opposed to standing in its way." 
 But Jay Tanski, a coastal geologist at New York Sea Grant who has studied South Shore erosion, questioned a blanket ban on hardened structures. "As a rule, prohibitions against any particular form of erosion control is not necessarily the best way to go," he said. "The decision should be made on a case-by-case basis. In some cases that might mean you would allow a bulkhead."
 Mr. Tanski said that property owners' legal challenges to local restrictions left judges to manage shorelines. "And a judge probably has a lot less of an understanding of what's happening on the shoreline than a lot of the other people involved," he said.
 Wayne D. Bruyn, a lawyer in Southampton for several oceanfront property owners, said future challenges to the armoring prohibition were probable. "The time will come when there are significant erosion issues, and the review of this statute, if it gets adopted, will be right in the forefront," he said.
 Mr. Bruyn argued that existing town regulations already effectively prohibited hardened structure on the beach. He said the amendments would take away owners' rights to apply to the town's zoning board of appeals for variances.
 The amendments now under consideration had their roots in the winter of 1998, when a series of punishing northeasters tore away ocean shores east of Southampton Village in an area where owners had sued the town for permission to erect steel bulkheads.
 One owner, the real estate magnate William Rudin, had erected a cofferdam that jutted into the sea, blocking public passage along the shore. Prior to the 1998 storms, Mr. Rudin replaced the cofferdam with a 20-foot-high embankment of sand tubes to protect his $1.6 million home. The town agreed to the structure as an alternative to a steel bulkhead. 
 In January 1998, the structure, whose cost Mr. Rudin declined to reveal but which was locally estimated to have cost more than $1 million, was exposed by waves and collapsed. Mr. Rudin's house was damaged beyond repair and the remains of the exposed structure and the house became a spectacle.
 "This really strange, bizarre structure sat on the beach sort of like something from outer space, and visible for miles," said Ms. Zenk, who cited the event as her reason for running for the town board. Mr. Bruyn, a lawyer for Mr. Rudin, said Mr. Rudin now planned to build a new home.
 The sand has now returned to the shoreline area where the Rudin house stood, people familiar with the area said.

HEADLINE: A Glimpse At the Bench From the Inside 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO

DATELINE: SOMERVILLE 

 BODY:
BARRY T. ALBIN was a bit taken aback when his 5-year-old son looked up from playing with his robots the other day and told his father, "With great power, comes great responsibility."
 At first, he thought his son, Gerald, was a genius, having perfectly crystallized the thoughts that had been weighing on the mind of the newest member of the state Supreme Court these last few months. Then he realized the boy was simply quoting from his new favorite movie, "Spiderman." 
 So maybe the full meaning of his position as one of seven members of the highest court in the state has not sunk in with his young son, but it has not been lost on Mr. Albin, who has spent much of his career taking the side of the underdog, never dreaming he would be expected to make decisions that would affect the entire state -- and sometimes beyond. 
In a rarely granted interview by a sitting member of the state Supreme Court, Mr. Albin last week gave an insider's look at what it takes to get appointed to the bench, the behind-the-scenes decision-making process of the state's highest court, and the thinking and personality of its newest member. 
Mr. Albin, who is originally from the Bayside section of Queens, is not the typical Supreme Court justice -- most of whom spend years in public service, either in the state attorney general's office or sitting on lower benches before being named to the highest court in the state. InsteadMr. Albin spent his last 20 years in private practice as a partner at the renowned Woodbridge firm of Wilentz, Golman & Spitzer. There he handled some of the toughest criminal and civil rights cases, often against the very public servants who might have aspired to a seat on the Supreme Court. 
And over those same 20 years, he became the favored son of the firm's titular head, Warren Wilentz, and developed a tight bond with James E. McGreevey, crossing paths in 1982 at the Middlesex County prosecutors office, where Mr. Albin was just leaving as the future governor was arriving. In the intervening years Mr. Albin and Mr. McGreevey became close allies, especially after Mr. McGreevey was elected mayor of Woodbridge. 
"We instantly became friends, and that friendship grew and evolved over the years," said Mr. Albin. "From the earliest days, he was a hard-working, hard-driving person who had as a primary goal public service and doing something good with it. And I had a similar motivation."
While he described himself as "never a politically overt person," Mr. Albin was a generous contributor to Mr. McGreevey's various campaigns, dating to the governor's successful run for state Senate in 1993. When it came time for the governor to make his first pick for the Supreme Court, the 51-year-old lawyer was at the top of the list. Mr. Albin declined to speculate on how much his personal connections to the governor played into his selection except to say that "a governor doesn't put someone on the Supreme Court unless he or she thinks that person has the legal ability, intellectual acumen, experience and judgment."
Others in the state's legal community had predicted the selection.
"I knew he had a close relationship with Jim McGreevey and that he thought highly of him, but regardless of who the governor was, Barry would be on anyone's short list for the Supreme Court," said Alan Zegas, a criminal lawyer from Chatham. "He's one of the finest trial attorneys I've ever met in my life anywhere." 
Now Mr. Albin finds himself seated beside six justices appointed by Gov. Christie Whitman. As a Democrat replacing Justice Gary Stein, a Republican who is retiring, Mr. Albin tipped the political balance on the bench, which now consists of four Democrats, two Republicans and one independent. With Justice James Coleman reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70 later this year, there has been some pressure on the governor to replace him with a Republican. While acknowledging that his party choice reflects his value system, Mr. Albin insisted that one's party affiliation has no bearing on the Supreme Court.
"The politics of party play no role whatsoever in the discussions of the court," he said. "There's no political partisanship, no political labels are tossed around. We are interpreting the Constitution and do not decide cases along a political construct."
Just how they do make their decisions is a puzzle to the general population, and the desire to demystify the process was one reason Mr. Albin agreed to be interviewed. 
"If people could look into the conference room, I think they'd be very proud of how dedicated these justices are," he said. "I sometimes wonder how we are able to dispose of so many matters, that seven people could be so productive in the course of a day."
Thinking this would be a "life style change for the better," Mr. Albin said he has been most surprised by the volume of work involved. Rather than spending more time with his wife, Inna, and his two sons, Gerald and Daniel, 3, Mr. Albin -- the self-described "rookie on the bench" -- is putting in more time than ever poring over the law books. 
The court sits for two days every other week from September through May, hearing oral arguments on a total of about 150 cases a year -- or about 10 percent of the cases the judges are petitioned to hear. In weighing the merits of hearing a case, Mr. Albin said the judges apply two standards: if the case raises an issue of paramount public importance, or if it should be decided in the interest of justice.
In addition to reviewing the petitions and hearing cases, the court also handles any case that had a dissenting vote at the appellate level, all death penalty cases, all the administrative rules governing the legal profession in the state, and about 1,500 motions from the lower courts each year. 
The 1,500 petitions of certification are divided among the seven judges, who meet every other week in conference to discuss which cases they will take and to debate the cases they heard the previous week. The process is very democratic, Mr. Albin said, with each justice getting a chance to go first in presenting his or her opinion.
Once a cases is decided, the chief justice assigns the judge who will write the majority opinion, as well as who will write the dissenting opinion if it is a split vote. As it is the job of each judge to persuade fellow justices, Mr. Albin said the discussions are intense, but always collegial.
"I've never witnessed a single word uttered in anger," Mr. Albin said. 
Depending on the complexity of the case, it can take the justices from one to six months to issue an opinion. Since joining the bench in late September, Mr. Albin has written one opinion -- as the lone dissenter on a case of a man denied admission to a pre-trial intervention program based on previous arrests. In his opinion, Mr. Albin argued that the prior charges were either unsubstantiated or dismissed, and therefore should not be a factor in determining eligibility in the pre-trial program. 
Darren Gelber, a partner at the Wilentz firm, was not surprised by his former colleague's position.
"The first opinion he offered was a dissent," Mr. Gelber said. "That should tell you something about him.. 
Another member of the firm, Blair Zwillman, pointed to the role played by Mr. Albin -- on the court only about two weeks -- in the widely followed debate over the state Democratic Party's 11th-hour move to replace Robert G. Torricelli with Frank R. Lautenberg in last fall's Senate campaign .
"He's not taking a back seat to anybody," said Mr. Zwillman. "In the Lautenberg case, he took a leading role in the questioning. He's not timid and he's not intimidated."
Mr. Albin gained a reputation in his years in the courtroom as a tough adversary. In fact, he was asked to join the Wilentz firm after beating Warren Wilentz in an arson case while serving as an assistant prosecutor in Middlesex County.
"I was 28 years old, and Warren was one of the majestic figures of the law," said Mr. Albin, a graduate of Rutgers University and Cornell Law School. "I worked like the devil to prepare for that case, knowing I had to make up for what I lacked in experience with hard work.".
After joining the firm, Mr. Albin was taken under the wing of Mr. Wilentz, the brother of Robert Wilentz, a former Supreme Court Chief Justice, and son of the firm's founder, former Attorney General David Wilentz, who prosecuted Bruno Hauptmann in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case. Today, Mr. Albin calls Mr. Wilentz his "best friend, mentor and father figure." 
He took it particularly hard when Mr. Wilentz was paralyzed in an automobile collision last December. Despite his demanding court schedule, Mr. Albin has spent a good deal of time at the bedside of his 79-year-old mentor, who is being treated at the Kessler Institute in West Orange. His own father, Gerald Albin, died in 1980, just months after Mr. Albin met Mr. Wilentz.
Mr. Albin says his interest in public service was awakened when he was 8 years old and John F. Kennedy was president, and was further shaped by the working-class neighborhood in which he grew up in Queens and by helping his father in the pressroom of The New York Times. His empathy for the underdog developed in his years as an assistant prosecutor and as a criminal defense lawyer.
"I've had paraded before me the entire spectrum of human folly," said Mr. Albin. "People are frail, they have weaknesses and foibles. All this is part of the human condition. When you are exposed to so many, you tend to become less judgmental."
The highlight of his career as a defense attorney came in 1998, when he represented a doctor from Cyprus who had died after being shot by the police in Mount Vernon, New York, then taken to Mount Vernon Hospital. Mr. Albin spent six years living with both a brutality case against the Mount Vernon Police Department and a negligence case against the hospital. During the three days of jury deliberation, Mr. Albin admits the thought crossed his mind that "I might have brought the firm into an economically bad situation." But when the jury came back with guilty verdicts and awarded the family $17.5 million -- one of the largest in a federal civil rights case -- his self-doubt disappeared.
An avid reader of history and a born storyteller with strong opinions, Mr. Albin has had to watch what he says and with whom he talks with since joining the Supreme Court. 
"I've had to become a very boring, uninteresting person, even in expressing my personal opinion," said Mr. Albin, who, for instance, would not discuss his views on the death penalty or Roe v. Wade. "I have to be careful that people don't think I'd prejudge some issue that might come before the court."
While he does not view his service on the Supreme Court as a mandate to impose his values on the rest of the world, Mr. Albin does see it as a chance to shape the future.
"This job permits me to address the great legal issues that are confounding the law and society," he said. "I have the unique opportunity of being able to have an extraordinary impact on the development of the law. How many people have that opportunity?"

HEADLINE: On the Street, Looking for Work 

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: PALISADES PARK 

 BODY:
THEY gather along East Columbia Avenue near Route 46 some of them even before the warming sun comes up -- standing in doorways and in front of stores on these frigid, gray mornings, waiting for contractors to pick them up and take them to jobs in construction, painting or, when the weather dictates, shoveling snow. In the other months they can be found cutting grass or blowing leaves. 
 Eric Carreto, a 22-year-old Guatemalan, is one of thousands of day laborers in the state -- mostly Hispanic men in baseball caps or watch caps pulled down over their ears who emerge from crowded apartments every morning and gather at such places as Morris Street in Morristown or Warren and Blackwell Streets in Dover or Throckmorton Street in Freehold. 
 "I come by walking, by bus," Mr. Carreto, who fled the poverty and civil strife of Guatemala, explained in Morristown one recent morning. "I come for a better life." 
No one can say with any certainty how many there actually are. Barrie A. Peterson, associate director of the Institute on Work at Seton Hall University, who is one of the authors of a 2000 study on immigrant workers in New Jersey, estimated that of the 8 to 12 million undocumented people in the United States, about 400,000 of them live in New Jersey. Of that number, Mr. Peterson said, about 100,000 could be day laborers, "although this is a really wild guess."
In a country of immigrants, the sight of impoverished groups of men arouses sympathy in those who recall the plight of their own parents and grandparents. But in a landscape dotted with million-dollar homes, luxury cars and teenagers roaming upscale malls with cellular phones in hand, they also arouse anger and resentment. As recently as two years ago, two Mexican day workers who were picked up in Farmingville, on Long Island, by two men posing as contractors were driven to an abandoned factory and attacked with construction tools and a knife. 
More common, however, are complaints by merchants that the laborers block their doorways and intimidate customers. Residents say the men often litter and relieve themselves on their property.
"If you drive up in a pickup truck and you're surrounded by three dozen guys yelling, 'Me work! Me work! Me work!' -- a lot of people don't like that," said Howard J. Lewis, who owns Moore Hardware and Industrial Supply in Morristown. 
Mistrust on All Sides
For their part, local governments and police departments say there is little they can do, noting that anti-loitering ordinances have been struck down in case after case. Still there is a measure of mistrust and resentment on all sides. 
"Sometimes the police go around and stare you down and make you feel bad because you know they're making you feel little or small," said Santos Ruiz, a 20 -year-old Guatemalan who lives in Palisades Park.
To Daniel J. Tichenor, an assistant professor of political science at Rutgers, the hostility displayed toward this latest wave of immigrants is not surprising. 
"If you look at public opinion polls and editorials over the years, I think it's fair to say over the long haul Americans have always celebrated their immigrant past but have been ambivalent about the immigrant present and future." said Professor Tichenor, who wrote "Dividing Lines: The Politics of Immigration Control in America" (Princeton University Press, $22.95).
Moreover, since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, some polls show a decline of whatever sympathy for immigrants or support for mass immigration that once existed. 
In other regions of the country, some municipalities and counties have managed to set up alternate locations -- separate areas and hiring halls in buildings or trailers -- where workers and contractors can gather without causing congestion and where English courses, labor counseling and health services are also available. But many opponents have questioned the legality of the halls, since they would attract undocumented workers as well as legal immigrants. 
Still, Pablo Alvarado, national coordinator of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, based in Los Angeles, said sweeps of street corners by the Immigration and Naturalization Service were not the answer to a community's dilemma. 
"This is not an issue of immigration," Mr. Alvarado said. "This is an issue of public health and public safety."
In Nassau County, on Long Island, the executive Thomas R. Suozzi, said he felt that way when as mayor of Glen Cove he opened an indoor hiring hall for day laborers, the first on Long Island.
"The people in our community are not against new immigrants coming into the community," Mr. Suozzi said. "In fact, my father was an immigrant, and many in Glen Cove were immigrant families. What people are against are people who flout the laws of the community." 
Efforts in New Jersey to create similar sites have been spotty at best. Morristown has been debating the subject for several years. Dover's attempt has fallen through at least temporarily. Freehold has reluctantly provided a small area near its train station lot but little else. And Bergenfield has offered an area behind Borough Hall where men seeking workcan congregate. A Bergen County task force, commissioned to look for a site to get day laborers off the streets of Palisades Park, failed to do so in the mid-1990's, although the new county executive has indicated that he wanted to resume the search. 
Before 1990, Palisades Park -- a one-square-mile enclave of 18,000 people -- was rooted in a blue-collar ethos that was basically Italian American. But from 1990 to 2000, the population increased 17.5 percent, primarily though an influx of Koreans and Hispanics that gave rise to cultural stresses that the town has yet to resolve.
More than that, the surge of immigrants here reflects the larger picture in New Jersey, where the foreign-born population rose 53 percent from 1990 to 2000 and the number from Latin America doubled, from 324,875 to 634,084 -- making them the largest immigrant group in the state.
Santos Ruiz came to Palisades Park four years ago from a section of Guatemala where, he said, "the military would just kill and nobody knowing why they killed." Today he lives in an apartment here with three brothers, and he sends home a portion of his pay.
"I came here to work," Mr. Ruiz said through an interpreter at at the Palisades Park Library, where he was taking a class to learn English. "And then I send money back to my family, and that's how they can kind of stabilize their lives." 
Mr. Carreto, speaking at the offices of an advocacy group in Morristown called Wind of the Spirit where he, too, takes English language courses, said he showed up on Morris Street in Morristown five and six days a week for a year seeking work, but not long ago found a permanent job as a bus boy.
"I did painting, landscaping, carpentry, and roofing," Mr. Carreto said. "Sometimes I would stand two and three hours. If you go early, you find job. If you go late, you no find jobs." He added, "Better working in restaurant than on corner."
Valerie Massaro, a Leonia resident who organized an English class for day laborers here, said: "Many will work for three months for this company and then go on the street again. Some of them have had the same job for years."
Of course, picking up odd jobs presents other problems. Angel Patino, an organizer at the Wind of the Spirit Immigrant Resource Center in Morristown said workers regularly came in to complain of being cheated of wages. 
"We tell the day laborers to keep records," said Mr. Patino.
But this involves getting the name of the employer, plus an address or a phone number, which contractors are often reluctant to give.
"These people are in a desperate situation," he said of the workers. "They need some money to pay the rent and buy food. So they accept these conditions."
According to Kevin Smith, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Labor, said his agency received about 12,000 such complaints a year. But Mr. Smith said he could not estimate how many of these came from day laborers because the department does break down its statistics that way. Nor, for that matter, does it have the jurisdiction to check workers' immigration status.
"The federal government has reserved that right for itself," he said. "When we get into these investigations, our first concern is basically to recover the money due to the worker."
And when on a dangerous job, the workers are usually on their own. A laborer who fell from a ladder and seriously injured was dropped off by his employer at the side of a road on the outskirts of Morristown.
"He didn't even bring him inside the town," said Diana Mejia, a co-founder and executive director of Wind of the Spirit. "Somebody called me and we went to bring him to the hospital."
Mr. Peterson of the Institute on Work said that contrary to the accepted wisdom, even illegal immigrants benefited the economy. The study he helped to write, "Immigrant Workers in New Jersey: A Preliminary Assessment of Available Statistics, Issues and Policy Options," found that half of the state's undocumented workers paid millions of dollars into Social Security and unemployment insurance, even though they never get the benefits.
"They are making the prices of restaurant meals and landscaping services and light manufacturing less for everyone," Mr. Peterson said. "And we're exploiting them because their pay is pretty low and the employers in fact are not even paying them and when they do, there is very little likelihood unemployment insurance or workers compensation is being taken care of." 
'There've Been Complaints'
Mayor Sanford Farber of Palisades Park, while allowing that he appreciated the work ethic of day laborers and sympathized with their plight, said he was also the recipient of many complaints from residents.
"There've been complaints from parents saying my daughter and their friends had suggestive remarks made to them by these people standing in front of the buildings," Mayor Farber said. And he added, "I myself have observed people urinating on people's lawns."
One recent morning, almost 300 men, by one count, lined Columbia Avenue and Broad Avenue, the main thoroughfares here. 
"We're a very small town," he said. "It makes the town look very, very bad to have several hundred people standing on the streets."
By about 1992, day laborers became a visible presence in Palisades Park. As a feeder road for Route 46, Columbia Avenue was a convenient spot for the workers and contractors to hook up. In addition, it is accessible to workers who live in surrounding towns like Cliffside Park, Ridgefield, Fairview and Leonia as well as northern tier towns of Hudson County. 
In January 1993, the police began enforcing a 1972 loitering law that almost a year later was struck down as unconstitutional by a municipal court judge.
With that, the police began issuing traffic tickets to contractors, making it more difficult for workers and contractors to hook up. The town had already passed an ordinance limiting the number of people who could occupy a room in an apartment or boarding house.
To defuse the situation, Denis J. Johnston, director of the Immigrant Rights Program for the American Friends Service Committee, and the Rev. Richard Wittig, pastor of the Leonia United Methodist Church, called for the creation of an alternative location where the workers could gather , a compromise that was rejected by Mayor William Maresca of Palisades Park.
In November 1994 the workers finally got the ear of County Executive William P. Schuber, who conferred with a group of officials who had successfully set up a hiring hall in Montgomery County, Md.
Ellie Spiegel, a Leonia resident who was part of a group that visited the center in Montgomery County, said, "They had a great program that could serve as a model." 
CASA of Maryland, a non-profit community action and social services organization, had worked with Montgomery County officials in 1993 to secure state and county financing to buy and renovate a house in East Silver Spring. The CASA Employment and Training, Center, which now draws up to 300 workers a day, supplies lists of professional and unskilled laborers to registered employers. In addition, it offers workers English and computer classes, health services and assistance with housing.
"The solution is to be together, that everybody be involved," said Gustavo Torres, executive director of CASA of Maryland. "And it's very important that the workers be involved because if you make a decision without the workers, they are not going to buy into it."
In February 1995, Mr. Schuber formed a task force to find a location for such a hiring hall. But by 1997, the group -- made up of the county's department of human services, the mayors and other representatives from Palisades Park, Ridgefield, Cliffside Park and Fairview as well as several day laborers -- could not agree on a site, and Mr. Schuber disbanded the group. . 
"We just couldn't achieve consensus on that," said Mr. Schuber who is no longer the county executive, "and that was really one of my regrets."
The issue arose again last May when the decomposed body of a day laborer was discovered in a disabled truck in an area of warehouses in Palisades Park.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Schuber's successor, Dennis McNerney, said that the executive favored creating a central site, and that he wanted to move quickly on it.
"We're searching for that location right now," said the spokeswoman, Julie Roginsky.
Although she declined to say where the county was looking, one official knowledgeable about the subject said the search was again focusing on the parking lot of an athletic field in the Palisade Park section of Overpeck County Park about a mile from Columbia Avenue. 
'A Sense of Urgency'
"Mr. McNerney thinks there is a sense of urgency on this issue, especially because of the weather and because of this recent death that really focused attention on this issue and because he feels it's the right thing to do to protect the day laborers from being hit by cars or picked up by unsavory contractors," she said. "It will also alleviate a lot of the pressure these towns are facing."
Mayor Farber, though initially opposed to the idea, said he had changed his mind. 
"It's gotten out of hand, and something has to be done," he said. But, he added, he is only in favor, if the county picks up the expenses. Ms. Roginsky said she did not know about financing, but added, "The county would take some sort of lead."
To Mr. Alvarado of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, the protracted struggle in Bergen County is not unusual. "Some of these work centers are funded by local municipalities, some of them by general use funds; some use community development block grants; and some centers are run by private foundations; and, like in L.A., it's both private money and public money," he said. 
In Morristown, where the Hispanic population has doubled, to 5,000, in the last decade and amounts to a fourth of the population, the day laborers who line Morris Street each morning have contributed to the shock of rapid change in the three-square mile community. 
To be sure, the arrest of a Honduran day laborer in the murder and sexual abuse of a 10-year-old son of Guatemalan immigrants two years ago has contributed to the community's wary attitude. Officials in Morristown say they have not been successful in finding a neighborhood in which to locate a hiring hall. 
Paul Miller, executive director of Morristown One Community, a nonprofit agency whose aim is to bring together the diverse community, said the owner of an abandoned building on Spring Street pledged to donate the site if he and Wind of the Spirit could get the building demolished and get a prefabricated building put up in its place. But so far, the town council has seemed declined to set up a committee to explore the proposal.
"We're trying to be creative in solving challenges facing the community, and when we faced the council, everyone seemed to point out the challenges rather than how to make it work," said Mr. Miller. "It's a political hot potato; there's no doubt about that. It's an issue that touches us all differently."
If there is not a hiring hall in Freeehold, there are at least some picnic tables in an area off Throckmorton Street near the railroad station where day laborers gather. 
"It was a very good effort by the Freehold police and Hispanic affairs to get the word out," said Lesbia Marrero, program director of the Hispanic Women Resource Center Program, who worked with the officials. "The public responded very positively to the intervention." 
But Joseph Bellina, the borough administrator, says there are some drawbacks. "It's taxing on the police department to monitor this," said Mr. Bellina . "There's a litter issue as a result of them throwing coffee cups all over the place and public urination. This is something the borough has to deal with." 
One town -- Dover, in Morris County -- seemed to be dealing with the issue. A center opened its doors about a year ago in a back office of the Morris County Organization for Hispanic Affairs on Bassett Highway. Unfortunately, the center faltered, said Paul C. McDougall, the clerk and administrator in Dover, partly, he added, because the Organization for Hispanic Affiars did not have enough volunteers to work there. And, he said, contractors were reluctant to register at the center because of "tax issues." 
"I was also told the laborers weren't happy because the guy who was closest to the door was the one that got hired," Mr. McDougall said. "There wasn't that equal opportunity there as in the wide open on the corner."
Mayor Richard M. Newman said the town was exploring its options, but added: "I don't know what our next step is. It depends of how things go. There's been talk about buying a building, but I'm not buying a building on taxpayers' money."
In Bergenfield in Bergen County, the government and the police department have arranged for day laborers to meet behind the Borough Hall, where bathrooms are available.
"Here in Bergenfield, as the day laborer population grew there was a desire not to be hostile and to organize it," said the Rev. Stephen Giordano, pastor of the Clinton Avenue Reformed Church and president of the Bergen County Council of Churches.
As Mr. Giordano, who served on Mr. Schuber's task force, put it, "If we as communities don't create a positive and healthy alternative, then we have no right to crack down on day laborers."

HEADLINE: No-Smoking Signs Spread Slowly Across Africa 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: KAMPALA, Uganda, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
President Yoweri Museveni said recently that his prayers would be answered if a thousand major cigarette companies operated in Uganda instead of just one.
 That one, British American Tobacco, provides about one-sixteenth of Uganda's total tax revenue and provides work, either directly or indirectly, for more than half a million people in a country in need of every job it can get. The company's philanthropy benefits AIDS orphans and war victims. 
 But Phillip Karugaba, a Ugandan lawyer and leading antismoking activist, has a different view of the company, an integral part of the economy of East Africa since the days of British colonialism. "If we had 1,000 B.A.T.'s we wouldn't have any population left," said Mr. Karugaba, who is trying to help Africa catch up with the antismoking movements raging elsewhere. "B.A.T. is so powerful and has so much money that it is not considered an evil monster here. Not yet." 
British American Tobacco, which is based in London and has subsidiaries throughout Africa and the world, earned $1.5 billion on revenue of more than $18 billion in its last fiscal year, and boasted recently that its Africa divisions had never lost a lawsuit filed by the antismoking lobby. (Brown & Williamson of the United States, which the company owns, has been the division most besieged by lawsuits.) Lately, however, African judges and lawmakers have left the company on the defensive here, an area that has long been a smoker's paradise.
Smoking is still allowed on many domestic airlines in Africa. Smoke clouds the air in most restaurants and bars and buildings. Some hospitals here even allow patients to puff on a cigarette as they mend.
Generally, the more destitute a country the less likely that smoking is controlled. South Africa, with sub-Saharan Africa's strongest economy, leads the way when it comes to tobacco regulation. Uganda, which still relies heavily on foreign economic assistance, is far behind.
"Relative lack of tobacco legislation in many African countries continues to make African countries a target of multinational tobacco companies," a group of African health ministers said last fall in preparation for talks next month at the World Health Organization on strict global tobacco regulations.
British American Tobacco, the world's second-largest tobacco company after Philip Morris, and the numerous other tobacco companies that operate around the continent have fought to keep Africa a smoking zone. Slowly, however, no-smoking signs are gaining in popularity.
Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania are enacting laws to restrict smoking in public places. In Uganda, a High Court judge, at Mr. Karugaba's urging, recently ordered the country's National Environmental Management Authority to enforce such restrictions within a year. British American Tobacco executives asked if the company could take part in the first planning meeting, but the government said no.
Antismoking advocates here say their goal is to regulate tobacco, not outlaw it. They are receiving backing from an array of groups in the United States like the San Francisco Tobacco Free Coalition that have been taking on the tobacco industry for years.
In Uganda, the activists are currently sparring with British American Tobacco over the warning labels on cigarette packs. Mr. Karugaba is seeking a court order that would strengthen the severity of the warnings, which now read, in capital letters: "Ministry of Health warning: Cigarette smoking can be harmful to your health."
When that warning label was under consideration by the Ugandan government in the late 1980's, British American Tobacco told policy makers that it did not believe cigarette smoking was harmful. "We think it would only be fair to have a form of words which is not excessively strong," the company wrote in 1988 to the Ugandan government, which was just the sixth African country at the time, along with Libya, Kenya, Senegal, Sudan and Mauritius, to put labels on cigarettes.
Since then, the company has acknowledged the health effects of smoking, albeit in a carefully worded way. Mr. Karugaba wants explicit warnings on packs that identify the diseases that can afflict smokers. He holds up as a guide the warnings in Canada, which show gruesome photographs of suffering smokers.
In another telling sign that the antismoking movement in Africa has advanced, lawsuits filed by individual smokers are no longer anomalies. While British American Tobacco successfully challenged separate lawsuits filed by two smokers in Uganda in 2000, a Nairobi lawyer recently filed a suit that is still in its early stages against the company's Kenyan subsidiary, accusing it of selling products that caused his client, an elderly farmer who suffers from vascular disease, to lose a leg.
Henry Rugamba, a spokesman for British American Tobacco's Uganda subsidiary, acknowledged that the company had been forced to deal with "a couple of lawyers who have made tobacco their issue." Nonetheless, he said, "I don't feel under siege. I think it is healthy -- if I can use the word -- to raise the issues."
Worried about its image, the company has begun a public relations campaign. It recently hired Wafula Oguttu, an antismoking activist who is the editor of the Monitor, Uganda's independent newspaper, to lead community discussions on smoking. In addition, British American Tobacco has voluntarily withdrawn much of its advertising, although it still blankets Kampala's bars and nightclubs with promotions for its Sportsman and Benson & Hedges brands.
Most of all, though, the tobacco industry is relying on its many friends in government. Uganda's finance minister, Gerald Ssendaula, is a tobacco trader himself. He recently interceded in a tax dispute on behalf of a small rival to British American Tobacco that makes products distributed by his family.
Meanwhile, the minister of tourism, trade and industry, Moses Ali, has invited Ugandans to smoke as a form of patriotism. "Nobody is forced to smoke but if you do then we welcome you because we shall get taxes from you," he told reporters recently.
The biggest cheerleader of all for British American Tobacco, however, has been Mr. Museveni, who has described the company as a lifesaver for a country so destitute. One of Mr. Museveni's media advisers, John Nagenda, is on the company's board of directors. 
The president plays down the dangers of cancer among Africans, who Mr. Museveni says smoke but do not inhale. "We puff it out," he said last year. "That is how my father has smoked for the last 70 years and stayed alive. We look at the Europeans swallowing the smoke, then hear they have a lot of cancer in Europe. I'm not surprised. Why do they swallow the smoke?"
Even with such high-level endorsements, however, British American Tobacco has found its Uganda cigarette sales -- about a billion sticks a year -- on the decline, and not just because of the antismoking movement. Smugglers have been bringing in lower-cost cigarettes from Kenya that are made by the company's rivals, like Supermatch produced by Mastermind Tobacco Limited. Also, other expenses have made cigarettes, which cost less than $1 a pack here, more of a luxury. The spread of cellphones in Africa, for instance, has left many people with less disposable income for cigarettes.
As for the health effects of smoking, officials with British American Tobacco scoff at the notion that tobacco is anywhere near as serious as the many other challenges facing Africa.
"If you go down to the Ministry of Health, they have serious issues with AIDS, malaria and child malnutrition," Mr. Rugamba said. "You only have a million smokers in Uganda. It's hard to talk tobacco when people are dying of AIDS."
The company's target market, young males, seem to have a mixed view -- which may be a sign the antismoking movement is having an effect. "I know it's harmful but it's not as big a health hazard as people make it to be," said Jefferson Mwaura, a 20-year-old Kenyan smoker. "It makes you look cool and sophisticated."
Mr. Mwaura's twin brother, Geoffrey, thinks differently. "It's like knowingly killing yourself," he said.

HEADLINE: Refinancing's Extra Dividend: Cash 

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
AS home values have soared in recent years and interest rates have fallen to their lowest levels in decades, record numbers of homeowners have refinanced their mortgages. While homeowners refinance to reduce their monthly payments or shorten the term of their mortgages, many also cash out part of their equity. Such borrowers are using this cash to pay off credit card debt, finance college educations, modernize their properties, buy second homes or even take exotic trips.
 In just the last two years, more than 15 million mortgages were refinanced, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The refinancing amounted to nearly half of the $2.5 trillion of all mortgage debt outstanding. 
 The amount of equity taken out by homeowners nationwide who refinanced amounted to about $84 billion in 2001 and $90 billion in 2002, according to Frank Nothaft, chief economist for Freddie Mac, the mortgage loan buyer. In 2000, by comparison, only $20 billion in equity was taken out. 
Home equity for all families across the United States grew by about $500 billion last year, Mr. Nothaft said. This heady rise in home values coincided with exceptionally attractive interest rates. In recent weeks, fixed-rate 30-year mortgages, for instance, have fallen to 40-year lows of less than 6 percent and certain adjustable mortgages have fallen below 4 percent. A Freddie Mac analysis for 2002 indicated that the average refinanced mortgage had an interest rate about one and one-eighth percentage points lower than the original mortgage. 
This fortunate pairing of growth in home value and reduction in mortgage rates effectively pumped more that $274 billion into the economy in 2001 and 2002, accounting for 20 percent of the real growth in the nation's gross domestic product during that time, according to a recent study of mortgage refinancing commissioned by the Homeownership Alliance. The alliance is a national coalition that includes realtors, home builders, community bankers and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, two Congressionally chartered companies that buy home loans and repackage them as securities for investors or hold them in portfolios.
For individual homeowners, the combination of reduced interest rates and the increased value of their homes has resulted in welcome opportunities. Take the example of a young couple in Long Island, who, because the husband is an undercover policeman, spoke only on condition of not being named. Almost five years ago, they bought a home for just under $200,000, and today it is worth about $350,000.
Now they plan to repay the $146,000 remaining on their initial 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loan with its 7 percent interest rate by taking out a new 30-year mortgage for $196,000. The interest rate on the new mortgage is fixed at 5.875 percent. That will leave them with payments of $1,137 a month, about $100 more than before. But the refinancing will enable the couple to add central air-conditioning, upgrade the bathroom and modernize the kitchen.
A more rarefied level of financial sophistication is reflected in the refinancing moves of Steven Schnall, chief executive of the New York Mortgage Company. In 1994 he bought a three-bedroom condominium on the Upper East Side. Five years later when he and his wife, Sherri, were engaged, she sold her apartment and they used the proceeds to buy the smaller condo next door to his and then spent $100,000 to combine the two. 
In 2002, with the combined units appraised for more than twice the purchase price, Mr. Schnall took out an interest-only adjustable-rate second mortgage starting at 4 percent on which the monthly payment covers only the interest and none of the principal. At the end of the loan term, one year and renewable, the entire principal balance will be payable in full. 
The couple then used the proceeds of that loan to invest in several publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trusts, which paid distributions of 8 percent to 12 percent annually. Thanks to the spread between the interest rates that they paid on their mortgage and the REIT payments that they received, the Schnalls were able last year to cover both the second mortgage and the entire mortgage payment on a new second home in Bridgehampton. 
For Dolores and Oscar Ruiz, a working couple with a 2-year-old son, the focus was on paying off debt when they decided two years ago to refinance the $205,000 mortgage on their three-bedroom Cape in New Jersey to gain a 6.85 percent rate on their new 30-year loan, compared with 7.75 percent on the former loan. 
Homeowners who refinance are routinely advised to consider taking a 15-year mortgage to replace a 30-year mortgage, in order to pay off the loan in a much shorter time and save significantly on the amount of interest paid. 
The Ruizes briefly considered taking a 15-year loan, but finally decided that the 30-year loan would be the better choice, considering their income and debts, and they took out a new mortgage for about $265,000, based on the increase in the value of their house. Despite the lower interest rate on their new 30-year loan, the Ruizes now pay $400 a month more than the $1,815.50 a month they paid on their previous mortgage. Butthe extra $400 is much more manageable than the $3,500 a month they had been paying on their credit cards.
"We've managed to pay off the entire debt; we rarely use our credit cards; and we've put money away for expanding the house for when we have more children," Mrs. Ruiz said during a recent conversation. After adding that she and her husband are weighing several options for expanding the house, Mrs. Ruiz acknowledged that there is a good chance the couple will refinance again. She added, "Refinancing was the best thing we did."
MR. NOTHAFT, the Freddie Mac economist, said the decision to take a 30-year or 15-year fixed-rate mortgage usually depends on the borrowers' level of comfort, something economists cannot measure.
"A lot of people take comfort in paying off their mortgage in 15 years because they want the certainty of knowing that they'll own their house free and clear in retirement," he said, adding that borrowers who can handle the significantly higher payments on a 15-year loan, compared with 30 years, will end up saving a considerable amount of money.
But whatever the length or amount of the loan, Mr. Nothaft stressed that borrowers need to make thoughtful, prudent choices. One of the most prudent, he advised, is not to take all the equity out of one's house. One reason, he said, is that the equity in the average family's house represents one-half of the family's net worth. 
Many financial advisers can provide examples of cases where prudence was not in evidence. According to Jay Gelbein, a financial planner in Staten Island, a few years ago, a Staten Islander who earned a modest salary working for New York City began buying a particular dot-com stock, which eventually was worth approximately $5 million. His goal in life was to own a gold-tinted Jaguar, but he did not want to cash in any part of his soaring stock. Instead, he refinanced his family house, which was valued at about $600,000, to buy his dream car, which cost $160,000. Very soon after he bought the car, the Jaguar owner's stock drove off a cliff.
By the time the client came to Mr. Gelbein for advice, he was left with only his heavily mortgaged house and his car. But because his salary was not sufficient to afford the new mortgage payments, which had almost doubled to $4,000 a month, and because the bank was threatening foreclosure, the client had no alternative but to sell the Jaguar -- at a substantial loss, Mr. Gelbein said -- and to refinance his house. To do so, he had to pay off the existing loan by stretching out the repayments over a longer term.
A large majority of homeowners who refinance, of course, use their equity for purposes they consider more essential. For example, last summer Nassau County clients of Raymond D. Mignone, a financial planner in Little Neck, Queens, refinanced to take out $40,000 for their daughter's wedding. Other clients who refinanced last summer used $20,000 in equity to fly to Nepal for 10 days to celebrate their 30th anniversary.
Richard J. Russell, the president of the Richland Equity Resources Corporation, a Manhattan mortgage broker, told of a client who had lots of money but little judgment in handling it. In 1993 the client obtained a $1 million mortgage from Chase bank and bought a house in Manhattan in the East 90's. When it was appraised about 13 months ago, its value had soared to $5 million. Hearing that, the client decided to refinance the house and take out $2.5 million -- $1 million to pay debts and the remainder for reasons he was reluctant to discuss. 
But the biggest hurdle in the client's loan quest was that his financial history included a number of tax liens, which resulted in his having low credit scores. Those scores -- known by the acronym FICO for Fair, Isaac & Company, a financial services company in California that developed the mathematical model for determining the scores -- are taken into account in the majority of mortgage decisions.
ALTHOUGH the client's wife had $4 million in cash invested in securities, and had the documents to prove it, Mr. Russell said, several banks denied them the loan because of the applicant's low FICO scores. But when the same financial documents and credit scores were shown to Washington Mutual, it lent the applicant the $2.5 million -- whereupon he and his wife promptly flew to the south of France and bought a villa for $1.5 million. When Mr. Russell asked why, since their principal residence is still in Manhattan and since they rarely travel far from home, the husband said, "We just liked it; besides, it was a good buy." 
A client of Robert B. Walsh, a financial planner in Jersey City, had a small advertising agency in Westchester County that was profitable until the Sept. 11 attacks; after that, business fell off. But rather than close shop, he refinanced his mortgage and took out $65,000 to keep the ad agency going. Soon thereafter it occurred to him that real estate held possibilities for those willing to work hard, so he enrolled in a program to obtain his real estate license. Although the ad agency is now down to a one-man part-time shop, it is still in business, Mr. Walsh said, and the one-man real estate venture has been doing quite well.
James Van Metter, a financial planner who lives in Yonkers and has an office in nearby Bronxville, N.Y., refinanced the mortgage on his own home last year and took out an extra $25,000 in cash. Soon thereafter he and his family took a Christmas vacation in La Penita de Jaltemba, a small Mexican village near Puerto Vallarta. And when a real estate agent showed them some beach properties overlooking the Pacific Ocean, they bought three lots for a total of $14,000. 
"We plan to build a house on one lot," Mr. Van Metter said, "and maybe rent it out and even retire there some day. In the worst case, we'll hold it for five years or so and then sell it." 
Some equity taken out of refinanced mortgages is used in helping others. Mr. Russell of Richland Equity Resources told of a client in his 80's who recently financed his home in Nassau County and took out $200,000 in cash to buy a $160,000 co-op in Great Neck for his daughter, a single woman in her 50's who has anorexia and currently lives with her father. Unable to work, her only income is from Supplemental Security Income, which covers disabilities.
There are many such examples, according to Lewis J. Altfest, a financial planner in Manhattan. He cited a father on Long Island who refinanced his house to give his somewhat free-spending son and daughter-in-law a $500,000 down payment on a house priced at more than $2 million, and a father in Washington who refinanced his home to give his daughter and son-in-law a $50,000 down payment on a house in Queens.
While such generosity is not uncommon among families, several financial planners and mortgage brokers said that since the terrorist attacks, they had noticed a palpable change in what homeowners do with the money they take out when they refinance. 
"Generally speaking, since 9/11 more people are living for today," said Frank Sisco, a financial planner with the Financial Management Corporation in Harrison, N.Y. "With or without refinancing, they're buying vacation homes, saying, 'Let's live and enjoy ourselves now.' "
Gary Schatsky, a financial planner in Manhattan, said that after Sept. 11, "there was an increase in a sense of mortality," which resulted in such things as people spending for expensive vacations.
But others are more restrained. In fact, he added, one of his biggest challenges is trying to talk millionaire clients in their 70's into enjoying themselves, but rarely succeeding because they are restrained by "Depression-era mentalities."
Somewhat similarly, Peter Giammarinaro, a financial planner in Basking Ridge, N.J., said, "With so many people unemployed, they want to reduce their debt load."
Not everyone succeeds. "A lot of people say that they want to refinance so they can pay off their credit cards and other debt first thing," said G. Joseph Fava, a mortgage consultant with BDS Financial Services in White Plains. "But when you meet up with them a little later and ask how their debt-repayment plans were working out, they're likely to hesitate a minute, then say something like, 'I went to Atlantic City and lost a little.' " 
Debt repayment is not necessarily the only prudent use of equity, planners say. Mr. Nothaft said that economists would consider tuition or other educational costs "a human capital investment." 
Mortgage brokers and financial analysts say a growing number of refinancers are interested in buying rental properties. "I see a lot of people these days who are borrowing against their current property for the down payment on a new house," said Frank M. Craparo, president of Homestead Mortgage Services in New Rochelle, "and then not selling but renting."
Mr. Van Metter in Bronxville said one of his clients was refinancing his house, taking $100,000 out and holding it in abeyance until a rental property becomes available in nearby Eastchester. Another client, a lawyer in Hastings-on-Hudson, built a summer house near Rhinebeck about a year ago, and now he is thinking of using the equity in his Hastings house to buy or build another house near Rhinebeck, this one a rental property. 
The growth in house values that helped to fuel the refinancing boom has been a double-edged sword for homeowners wanting to move to a large house. The solution is sometimes to expand in place, using the proceeds of a refinancing. "Here the housing stock is so expensive that it's almost impossible to move up in house size," said Nan Bailey, a financial planner in Larchmont, "so homeowners build up and out."

Forget Diversity

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
'Diversity" must be a very, very good thing; President Bush used the word, or a variant of it, 10 times in his speech last month announcing that the administration would seek to have the Supreme Court declare the undergraduate admissions policies at the University of Michigan unconstitutional. "I strongly support diversity of all kinds," said the president, with his flair for hijacking the key words of his opponents, "including racial diversity in higher education." As the president knows very well, "diversity" is precisely what the University of Michigan says its admissions program is designed to ensure. The two sides disagree only about the acceptable means of attaining this supreme good. 
 What, exactly, is so great about diversity? After all, when the process formerly known as affirmative action was first established, in the 60's, the goal was to help black people overcome the historic legacy of discrimination. As President Johnson famously put it in 1965, it is not enough to "take a person who for years has been hobbled by chains, and liberate him, bring him to the starting line of a race and then say, 'You are free to compete with others."' The goal of affirmative action in employment, which Johnson mandated by an executive order to his Labor Department (and President Nixon continued), was not to create a "diverse" workplace but to overcome hiring practices that had traditionally excluded or disadvantaged blacks. That remains the rationale for the highly circumscribed workplace affirmative action programs of today. 
 But "affirmative action" carries an explicitly zero-sum connotation; if one group of individuals is being advantaged, another group is, of course, being disadvantaged. From the outset, affirmative action, unlike older policies designed to spur integration, was attacked for establishing invidious racial categories. Universities eager to boost black enrollment fell under suspicion for the same reason. And then came diversity. In 1978, Justice Lewis Powell declared in the Bakke case that universities could offer a "plus factor" to minority students -- not to overcome the legacy of discrimination but to ensure a diversity of viewpoints.
Diversity has proved a much hardier rationale for the plus factor than the leg-up metaphor of President Johnson's speech, and for a simple reason: its central message is "Everyone benefits equally." Encountering new people and new ideas is a core aspect of the college experience. In "The Shape of the River," a scholarly brief for affirmative action, William G. Bowen and Derek Bok cite survey data showing that both white and black graduates of elite universities attach great importance to the ability to get along and work effectively with people of different racial and cultural backgrounds and also attribute "a great deal" of their ability to do so to experiences in diverse settings in college. The University of Michigan has tried to take this claim one step further by conducting a study that purports to show that both white and minority students learn better in racially diverse classroom.
Well, really. Does that mean that George W. Bush would have improved on that famous C average if the Yale undergraduate population of the mid-60's had been, say, 12 percent minority rather than maybe 2 or 3 percent? Does that mean that grade inflation is really a dependent variable of diversity? The idea seems absurd on its face. What's more, while I wish I had attended a more diverse institution (I graduated from college in 1976, when affirmative action was young), it's pretty low on my wish list. And my impression from talking to students at two campuses of the University of California, and at the University of Texas Law School, is that for most white students diversity is a pleasant side benefit, like a nice library. It was, on the other hand, a tremendous boon to minority students, who otherwise would have attended less elite institutions.
The difference in the nature of the benefits is so obvious and overwhelming that I have trouble believing that people really mean what they say about diversity; the whole thing feels like an elaborate charade to keep us from knowing what we're doing. What's more, diversity has a kind of self-perpetuating genius. The old remedial idea of affirmative action implied a time limit, when all contestants would be ready to line up together at the starting line. But since diversity, by contrast, is a good for all, there's no earthly reason to ever stop awarding a plus factor to minority students.
But diversity, or rather, affirmative-action-as-diversity, is not good for all. In addition to the longstanding problem of disadvantaging some in order to advantage others, the diversity rationale also insultingly assumes that black students bring a black "point of view," Asians an Asian one and so on, thus reifying the very barriers of race and ethnicity that affirmative action is meant to erase. And why should racial and ethnic "points of view" outweigh those forged by class or culture? Why, as a professor recently suggested to me, shouldn't the presence of the R.O.T.C. on campus be seen as a means to ensure representation of a "military" point of view otherwise absent from elite universities? 
Diversity distractsus from a simple but painful truth, which is that persistent black educational failure (and Hispanic failure, to a lesser extent) has made it impossible for the most selective schools to become substantially integrated using their own traditional criteria of merit. The problem is minority access to elite institutions, not white access to minority students. And perhaps we should say that if an elaborate charade is the only way to guarantee such access, then we shouldn't make a fetish of transparency, or even honesty. Perhaps. But I wonder if eliminating that mechanism wouldn't force universities -- and the rest of us -- to do something about the educational failure that has made affirmative action necessary in the first place.

I do not agree that petitioner's admissions program violates the Constitution. For it must be remembered that, during most of the past 200 years, the Constitution, as interpreted by this Court, did not prohibit the most ingenious and pervasive forms of discrimination against the Negro. Now, when a State acts to remedy the effects of that legacy of discrimination, I cannot believe that this same Constitution stands as a barrier." From the separate opinion of Justice Thurgood Marshall in Regents of the U. of California v. Bakke (1978)

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Democrats' Tax Stance Is Hurting Their Cause

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
FOR all of the talk about class warfare, one difference in the Republican and Democratic positions on taxes has actually received too little attention. That difference may be one reason that President Bush and the Republicans seem to have won the recent tax wars.
 Republicans have spent much of the last three years arguing for permanent tax cuts. The bigger, the better, they say, and the sooner, the better. "If this tax relief is good for Americans three or five or seven years from now, it is even better for Americans today," Mr. Bush said during his State of the Union address last Tuesday. 
 Democrats point out that the benefits of the 2001 tax cut and the one proposed by the White House flow mainly to affluent taxpayers. Many also note that Mr. Bush's plans will create deficits, just as baby boomers are joining the Social Security rolls.
These are the political differences that everyone seems to understand. It is when Democrats offer their own detailed plans that they introduce the third difference. Trying to seem like both tax cutters and deficit hawks, they call for temporary cuts that give households a one-time break without badly damaging the federal budget.
The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, announced a plan in January that would send checks equal to $300 for each adult in a family and another $300 for each of the first two children. Senator Byron L. Dorgan of North Dakota has proposed rebate checks of $500 for individuals and $1,000 for married couples. 
Instinctively, however, many people seem to understand that a temporary tax cut is more like a gift than something that allows people to change their behavior.
When households got rebates in 1975 as part of President Gerald Ford's effort to help the economy, they spent about one-third of them, according to several studies. People behaved similarly in 2001, even though those rebates -- a Democratic idea -- were actually a down payment on a permanent tax reduction, said Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan. 
In the early 1980's, by contrast, people spent about 90 percent of the additional money that showed up in their regular paychecks from President Ronald Reagan's tax cut, according to Nicholas S. Souleles, an associate professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania.
Mr. Slemrod said, "The more persistent people think a tax cut is, the more likely they are to incorporate it into decisions about how well off they are."
As a result, the Democratic message seems more convoluted than even the White House statistics portraying its new tax cut as broad-based. Democrats criticize Mr. Bush's plan for doing little to help most families and then offer plans that might do even less. They call for economic stimulus and propose to distribute money in a way that is likely to leave it sitting in savings accounts.
More effective options do exist. Rather than muddling their arguments against tax cuts by calling for a set of their own, Democrats could simply say that now was not the time for another reduction. Sending the money directly to states, which are eliminating jobs and cutting programs to close deficits, would do far more to help the weak labor market than a batch of $500 checks. 
Or the Democrats could propose their own permanent tax cuts. Mr. Bush's plan costs $674 billion over the next 10 years and delivers an average annual reduction of $131 to the bottom 60 percent of households, as ranked by income. The next 20 percent get an average of $657 a year, according to Citizens for Tax Justice in Washington.
FOR the same price tag, the government could instead give every family, regardless of income, an annual tax cut of about $920. The argument for a reduction like this would be fairly simple, too. Including all kinds of taxes -- income, payroll, sales and others -- the bottom fifth of earners pay an effective tax rate of about 18 percent, while the top fifth pay 19 percent. Since the tax burden is shared, Democrats could argue that a cut also should be shared.
The globalization of the economy might offer an even stronger rationale for a plan like this. Freer trade has brought some big benefits, allowing a flood of affordable imports and increasing growth, but it has also caused wages to stagnate for millions of workers who were trained for jobs that no longer exist. Reducing everybody's taxes would allow these families to share the prosperity. The economy might also get a quick lift because people would be more likely to spend the money from a real tax cut than from a rebate.
Would these plans still leave the Democrats open to charges of class warfare? Of course. But they might help the party emerge from its defensive crouch, and they could bring forth a more productive debate about stimulus, deficits and taxes.

HEADLINE: Dream Nears Reality: Ease Up at the F.C.C. 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
MORE than five years after he began his career at the Federal Communications Commission as a lonely dissenter, Michael K. Powell is poised to fulfill a long-held vision by unshackling the nation's largest telephone companies and media giants from decades of regulation. 
 Mr. Powell, 39, now the agency's chairman, is in the final stages of negotiations with the four other commissioners on a broad overhaul of the byzantine telephone rules. If, as most expect, the commission adopts a version of the latest draft of the revisions at its Feb. 13 meeting, the new rules will favor the regional Bell operating companies and will hurt the small start-up local carriers and the ailing long-distance giants like AT&T and WorldCom. 
 By spring, Mr. Powell also intends to repeal or relax the ownership rules that have kept the biggest media conglomerates from growing larger. 
Mr. Powell and his supporters say the changes will encourage tremendous new investment and promote innovation and competition through a heavier reliance on market forces. 
But his detractors, including consumer groups and smaller companies, say the Powell agenda will simply make big companies bigger. By relaxing rules now, they assert, the government will stifle competition, reduce the diversity of media voices and play into the hands of the largest companies, which are trying to shut down their rivals.
Mr. Powell views the changes as imperative to help industries that have moved slowly in making the transformation from analog to digital communications.
"It's ketchup on bad meat," he says in describing the way the phone, cable and satellite industries use technologies that are rapidly becoming outdated.
He insists there will still be plenty of rules when he is finished. "I don't know what anybody is talking about when they say this is deregulation," he said. "We are talking about a paradigm of competition, but in a very regulatory way. This is not an Adam Smith market. This is industrial management."
But some officials say that he is moving too fast and that his revisions will retard years of slow progress that have barely begun to open uncompetitive markets.
At a recent Senate hearing, Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, urged the commission not to sweep aside the telephone rules. "You are supposed to promote competition," an exasperated Mr. Hollings said, lecturing Mr. Powell. "Just at the time that the Telecommunications Act is really beginning to work -- because of the delays of the Bell companies -- now you are goingto reward them and expand their monopoly."
As the debate plays out, Mr. Powell has found himself in an enviable position. This promises to be a seminal year in the agency's oversight of industries that produce one-sixth of the nation's output, and he has the political luxury of strong allies in the Republican-led Congress. In contrast with the Clinton administration, the current White House has played a minimal role in shaping telecom policy, leaving the toughest decisions to the F.C.C.
Siding with the largest telecom conglomerates, federal courts have made a sport out of striking down many regulations written by Mr. Powell's predecessors. 
And the meltdown of the telecom market, Mr. Powell says, has demonstrated the falsity of the idea that rigorous regulation leads to robust competition.
Still, for all the political, legal and economic forces in Mr. Powell's favor, the commission is hardly unified and has shown signs of wanting to temper his agenda. Its two Democrats have shown signs of taking a different view on many issues. And one of the panel's two Republicans has expressed reservations about the pace and scope of Mr. Powell's agenda.
Mr. Powell speaks with thoughtful confidence about his vision of reducing the role of government, and he has little doubt that he is on the right side. He says he wants to clean up "an ugly and messy" legacy of contradictory rules that have stifled markets.
"I've seen plenty of bubbles of competition that have blown up," he said last week, implicitly criticizing his predecessors, who tried to take credit for introducing competition into some markets -- like cable television or local phone service -- through regulation. "I don't think we've done anybody any good if it is a flash in the pan, and I can take credit for it and walk out of here and then it pops."
To Mr. Powell, the Wall Street woes of many telecom companies are Exhibit A of the failures of previous policy makers. "If the status quo is so compelling," he said, "how is it that innovators and incumbents are suffering?"
Among other things, the proposed changes would broadly exempt the Bell companies from being forced to let rivals have low-cost access to new equipment for high-speed Internet services -- a market with enormous potential.
Gregarious and personable, Mr. Powell approaches issues with academic intensity. A bit of a technogeek, he carries multiple gadgets on his belt, loves to play with the latest electronic devices and keeps up with the newest advances in cellphones and other techie toys. His original plan, to follow his father, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in a military career, ended abruptly in 1987, when he was nearly killed in a car accident in Germany. After a year of debilitating operations, he decided to pursue a career in law. Among Republicans, Mr. Powell is seen as a rising star who could be an attractive candidate for public office someday.
Like Ronald Reagan and William H. Rehnquist, Mr. Powell has evolved from naysayer to agenda setter. But now he faces his own set of dissenters. Moving from the role of dissenting commissioner to chairman has not been easy, but he says that even in his loneliest days, he never "tried to burn down the house" or "act subversively."
Asked if any commissioners are embarked on that kind of subversive path, he politely declined to comment.
Among lobbyists, lawmakers and telecom executives, one of the most interesting shows in town is on the eighth floor of the communications commission, where Mr. Powell's focus has been on finding votes among the four other commissioners.
Although there are three Republicans on the panel, one, Kevin J. Martin, has already outlined significant differences. Mr. Martin, 36, arrived at the commission last year from the White House, where he served as a senior adviser to President Bush on telecommunications issues after working on the Bush presidential campaign. His wife, Cathie Martin, is a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney. 
While professing faith in market forces, Mr. Martin has articulated a more pragmatic form of deregulation, which calls for the government to move cautiously in markets dominated by a few players.
Mr. Powell, by contrast, has asserted that deregulation "should not be like a dessert that you serve after people have fed on their vegetables and is a reward for the creation of competition." Rather, he said, deregulation is "a critical ingredient to facilitating competition." 
Just how their philosophical differences translate into policy differences is clear from a speech Mr. Martin made recently, creating a stir in the telephone industry. Implicitly contrasting himself with Mr. Powell, Mr. Martin said he favored a longer transition period to ensure stable markets. He also expressed support for a strong role for state regulators, a stance that would have the effect of preserving many existing rules. Finally, he seemed to be less far-reaching in cutting back some current rules that have given rival phone companies access to many of the networks and equipment of the regional Bell companies at low prices.
Meanwhile, a Democratic commissioner, Michael J. Copps, has begun to marshal opposition to any broad changes in the media ownership rules. Mr. Copps is a 62-year-old historian, a self-styled New Deal Democrat and former aide to Mr. Hollings, who is the ranking Democrat on the committee that oversees the commission and the most persistent Senate critic of Mr. Powell. Mr. Copps has helped lead an influential coalition of conservatives and liberals who fear the consequences of eliminating rules they say have fostered diversity and local input in broadcasting and prevented media companies from becoming too large. 
Mr. Copps has raised the profile of the media ownership issues through public hearings by the commission. Mr. Powell refused to hold more than one hearing -- set for Richmond, Va., later this month -- then agreed to attend one in New York set up by Mr. Copps. Mr. Powell will not, however, attend a hearing, arranged by Mr. Copps and others, to be held in Los Angeles, where the artistic community has voiced deep concerns about his plans.
The telephone rules the agency is preparing to overhaul in effect dictate how much the four Bell regionals must charge rivals for using their networks and equipment, a requirement imposed by the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The requirements have been hailed by consumer groups, long-distance carriers and smaller local phone companies for creating new competition. 
SUPPORTERS of the rules say Mr. Powell's plan could eliminate emerging competition for local service, further tightening the grip held by the four Bell companies.
John W. Mayo, dean of Georgetown University's business school, said that "any move by the Federal Communications Commission to make the rates, terms or availability" of the current network pricing scheme "less attractive at this point will not create more competition but will, rather, almost certainly -- and perversely -- spell the end of the development of local exchange competition." 
But to Mr. Powell, the rules have failed to live up to their promise. The Bells actually face powerful new competition for local service, he says, from wireless providers and cable companies. Rather than promote competition, he says, the regulations have enabled some companies to make use of the most valuable equipment to provide service to the most profitable consumers without having to bear any of the costs of serving the less profitable, and more needy, market sectors.
Mr. Powell and the Bell regionals have also criticized recent moves by some states to keep the rates low for using essential network elements. The states have made the rate reductions in response to the urgent pleas of companies under severe financial pressure, notably AT&T. Mr. Powell and his supporters say a change in the rules will stimulate the economy by encouraging the largest phone companies and their rivals to build more networks and spend more at equipment makers like Lucent, Corning, Cisco and Intel.
Mr. Powell, who joined the commission after working as chief of staff for Joel I. Klein when he headed the antitrust division at the Justice Department, is broadly dismissive of the predictions that his actions will simply permit entrenched monopolies to grow stronger.
But his critics say there are plenty of powerful examples of the failure of deregulation. They see the consolidation of the deregulated radio broadcasting industry, for instance, as the coal-mine canary. They also point to the cable industry, where by some measures rates have jumped at three times the rate of inflation since deregulation began in the 1990's.
Mr. Powell likewise rejects the idea that changing the ownership rules will result in less diversity and local input in broadcasting by pointing out that there have never been so many outlets and views on the airwaves. He has also draped his argument in the flag of the First Amendment, which he suggests ought to be a powerful constraint against government limits on media.
"The First Amendment means something to me," he said. "It's well and good to be concerned about Citizen Kane, but not at the consequence of returning to King George."

(Doug Mills/The New York Times)(pg. 1) Chart: "Rewriting the Rule Book"This is the most important year at the Federal Communications Commission since Congress adopted the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Michael K. Powell will lead the agency in rewriting many vital regulations. Here is when to expect major actions. FEBRUARYThe commission is preparing to revise the rules that, in effect, control how much the regional Bell companies must charge rivals for using various parts of their networks. The commission is expected to phase out old rules that have been favorable to rivals and adopt new ones that exempt the Bell regionals from making their equipment available at the lowest cost for high-speed Internet services. FEBRUARY AND SPRINGIn response to a series of court setbacks and legal requirements, the commission will issue its findings on a host of media ownership rules. Many rules under review are expected to be relaxed or eliminated in the spring. (The commission's new rules on cable companies are due out in February). The rules being reconsidered include bans on the following: *A cable company owning more than 30 percent of the national market.*A company owning a newspaper and broadcast station in the same area.*A company owning two television networks.*A network owning stations that broadcast to more than 35 percent of the nation's homes.*A broadcaster owning two television stations in the same market unless it has at least eight rivals.*A company owning more than eight radio stations in the same market. SPRINGThe commission will decide whether the high-speed Internet services offered by telephone companies must be heavily regulated, as other telephone services are, or less regulated, like the broadband services provided by cable companies. A determination that telephone broadband be less regulated may mean that the telephone companies would not have to open their high speed networks to rival Internet service providers. The commission is also considering whether to impose any new regulations on cable broadband services. (pg. 7) Chart: "Michael K.

HEADLINE: Keeping Saddam Hussein in a Box 

BYLINE:  By John J. Mearsheimer and Stephen M. Walt; John J. Mearsheimer is professor of political science at the University of Chicago. Stephen M. Walt is academic dean of Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.

 BODY:
The United States faces a clear choice on Iraq: containment or preventive war. President Bush insists that containment has failed and we must prepare for war. In fact, war is not necessary. Containment has worked in the past and can work in the future, even when dealing with Saddam Hussein. 
 The case for preventive war rests on the claim that Mr. Hussein is a reckless expansionist bent on dominating the Middle East. Indeed, he is often compared to Adolf Hitler, modern history's exemplar of serial aggression. The facts, however, tell a different story. 
 During the 30 years that Mr. Hussein has dominated Iraq, he has initiated two wars. Iraq invaded Iran in 1980, but only after Iran's revolutionary government tried to assassinate Iraqi officials, conducted repeated border raids and tried to topple Mr. Hussein by fomenting unrest within Iraq. His decision to attack was not reckless, because Iran was isolated and widely seen as militarily weak. The war proved costly, but it ended Iran's regional ambitions and kept Mr. Hussein in power. 
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 arose from a serious dispute over oil prices and war debts and occurred only after efforts to court Mr. Hussein led the first Bush administration unwittingly to signal that Washington would not oppose an attack. Containment did not fail the first time around -- it was never tried.
Thus, Mr. Hussein has gone to war when he was threatened and when he thought he had a window of opportunity. These considerations do not justify Iraq's actions, but they show that Mr. Hussein is hardly a reckless aggressor who cannot be contained. In fact, Iraq has never gone to war in the face of a clear deterrent threat. 
But what about the Iraqi regime's weapons of mass destruction? Those who reject containment point to Iraq's past use of chemical weapons against the Kurds and Iran. They also warn that he will eventually get nuclear weapons. According to President Bush, a nuclear arsenal would enable Mr. Hussein to "blackmail the world." And the real nightmare is that he will give chemical, biological or nuclear weapons to Al Qaeda.
These possibilities sound alarming, but the dangers they pose do not justify war. 
Mr. Hussein's use of poison gas was despicable, but it tells us nothing about what he might do against the United States or its allies. He could use chemical weapons against the Kurds and Iranians because they could not retaliate in kind. The United States, by contrast, can retaliate with overwhelming force, including weapons of mass destruction. This is why Mr. Hussein did not use chemical or biological weapons against American forces or Israel during the 1991 Persian Gulf war. Nor has he used such weapons since, even though the United States has bombed Iraq repeatedly over the past decade. 
The same logic explains why Mr. Hussein cannot blackmail us. Nuclear blackmail works only if the blackmailer's threat might actually be carried out. But if the intended target can retaliate in kind, carrying out the threat causes the blackmailer's own destruction. This is why the Soviet Union, which was far stronger than Iraq and led by men of equal ruthlessness, never tried blackmailing the United States.
Oddly enough, the Bush administration seems to understand that America is not vulnerable to nuclear blackmail. For example, Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, has written that Iraqi weapons of mass destruction "will be unusable because any attempt to use them will bring national obliteration." Similarly, President Bush declared last week in his State of the Union address that the United States "would not be blackmailed" by North Korea, which administration officials believe has nuclear weapons. If Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear arsenal is "unusable" and North Korea's weapons cannot be used for blackmail, why do the president and Ms. Rice favor war? 
But isn't the possibility that the Iraqi regime would give weapons of mass destruction to Al Qaeda reason enough to topple it? No -- unless the administration isn't telling us something. Advocates of preventive war have made Herculean efforts to uncover evidence of active cooperation between Iraq and Al Qaeda, and senior administration officials have put great pressure on American intelligence agencies to find convincing evidence. But these efforts have borne little fruit, and we should view the latest reports of alleged links with skepticism. No country should weave a case for war with such slender threads.
Given the deep antipathy between fundamentalists like Osama bin Laden and secular rulers like Saddam Hussein, the lack of evidence linking them is not surprising. But even if American pressure brings these unlikely bedfellows together, Mr. Hussein is not going to give Al Qaeda weapons of mass destruction. He would have little to gain and everything to lose since he could never be sure that American surveillance would not detect the handoff. If it did, the United States response would be swift and devastating.
The Iraqi dictator might believe he could slip Al Qaeda dangerous weapons covertly, but he would still have to worry that we would destroy him if we merely suspected that he had aided an attack on the United States. He need not be certain we would retaliate, he merely has to think that we might. 
Thus, logic and evidence suggest that Iraq can be contained, even if it possesses weapons of mass destruction. Moreover, Mr. Hussein's nuclear ambitions -- the ones that concern us most -- are unlikely to be realized in his lifetime, especially with inspections under way. Iraq has pursued nuclear weapons since the 1970's, but it has never produced a bomb. United Nations inspectors destroyed Iraq's nuclear program between 1991 and 1998, and Iraq has not rebuilt it. With an embargo in place and inspectors at work, Iraq is further from a nuclear capacity than at any time in recent memory. Again, why the rush to war? 
War may not be necessary to deny Iraq nuclear weapons, but it is likely to spur proliferation elsewhere. The Bush administration's contrasting approaches to Iraq and North Korea send a clear signal: we negotiate with states that have nuclear weapons, but we threaten states that don't. Iran and North Korea will be even more committed to having a nuclear deterrent after watching the American military conquer Iraq. Countries like Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia will then think about following suit. Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons will be difficult in any case, but overthrowing Mr. Hussein would make it harder.
Preventive war entails other costs as well. In addition to the lives lost, toppling Saddam Hussein would cost at least $50 billion to $100 billion, at a time when our economy is sluggish and huge budget deficits are predicted for years. Because the United States would have to occupy Iraq for years, the actual cost of this war would most likely be much larger. And because most of the world thinks war is a mistake, we would get little help from other countries. 
Finally, attacking Iraq would undermine the war on terrorism, diverting manpower, money and attention from the fight against Al Qaeda. Every dollar spent occupying Iraq is a dollar not spent dismantling terrorist networks abroad or improving security at home. Invasion and occupation would increase anti-Americanism in the Islamic world and help Osama bin Laden win more followers. Preventive war would also reinforce the growing perception that the United States is a bully, thereby jeopardizing the international unity necessary to defeat global terrorism. 
Although the Bush administration maintains that war is necessary, there is a better option. Today, Iraq is weakened, its pursuit of nuclear weapons has been frustrated, and any regional ambitions it may once have cherished have been thwarted. We should perpetuate this state of affairs by maintaining vigilant containment, a policy the rest of the world regards as preferable and effective. Saddam Hussein needs to remain in his box -- but we don't need a war to keep him there.

HEADLINE: Dealing With Aging ExecutivesWho Just Won't Quit 

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Karen W. Arenson, David Carr, Jonathan D. Glater, Mary Williams Walsh and Edward Wong also contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
WHEN CBS News pushed Don Hewitt, the legendary executive producer of "60 Minutes," out of his job last week at the age of 80, the incident seemed so extraordinary that it made headlines. On first glance, it was. Mr. Hewitt invented the news magazine and embodied the format at its best. Even at his age, he wangled an additional 18 months as head of "60 Minutes" out of CBS as well as a contract that will pay him until he is 90.
 But the thorny issue Mr. Hewitt's retirement plan raised -- how to ease older employees out the door -- confronts plenty of corporations these days. Age is a sensitive issue in the workplace. As retirement begins to look less appealing and often less feasible, many older but still vibrant Americans want to hang on to their jobs longer. Corporations, on the other hand, usually encourage workers to retire at 65 or younger because they generally cost more in wages and health benefits. 
 Neither the aging of the American work force nor the increasing longevity of workers has led corporations to adjust their thinking about how old is too old, employment experts said. Examples abound of well-known chairmen and chief executives working past 65 -- to name a few, Sanford I. Weill, of Citigroup, is 69; Maurice R. Greenberg, of the American International Group, is 77; Sumner M. Redstone, of Viacom is 79, and Warren E. Buffett, of Berkshire Hathaway, is 72.
Oddly enough, they are the exceptions for top-level executives; generally they can soldier on because they own large stakes in the company or, like Mr. Hewitt, exemplify a franchise. At the top executive level, big public companies almost uniformly enforce mandatory retirement policies, usually at age 65. To meet today's standards of corporate governance, directors spend far more time developing succession plans for senior managers and grooming replacements, management consultants said.
But federal law protects rank-and-file employees and most managers who have celebrated their 65th birthday -- they may work until they can no longer do their jobs. That makes deciding when to retire a more difficult and more personal decision for them, and often a touchy problem for companies. They handle it "badly or not at all," said Warren G. Bennis, a professor at the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California. "They usually have some very arbitrary, mandatory systems."
Professor Bennis, a co-author of "Geeks & Geezers" (Harvard Business School Press, 2002), said that the long standoff between CBS and Mr. Hewitt, who had vowed to run the show until he died, demonstrated how hard it can be to convince someone that his time is up.
"How does one know when they're over the hill?" said Professor Bennis, who is 78. "How do you create a social system where you can maintain the self-esteem of the person who is being asked to leave?"
Companies tend to offer money as an incentive, often sweetening or accelerating benefits, to usher employees into retirement. But many highly successful and highly paid people measure their self-worth by where they work, so they have to be pushed -- unless they are too big and powerful to oust.
DAYTON Ogden, co-chairman of Spencer Stuart, described a category of chief executives "who want to stay as long as they can and go out feet first." They, he added, tend to think that "nobody can really replace them." Or, he said, "they just love the platform so much that they do not want to retire from it." Mr. Ogden said that Mr. Weill at Citigroup was "sort of the poster child" for that group. Mr. Weill, who will turn 70 next month, has not said when he will retire.
Nor has Mr. Redstone at Viacom, which owns CBS. Mr. Greenberg, to the dismay of Wall Street, is also coy about his retirement plans, but he tried to assuage investors last week by saying that A.I.G.'s directors knew which executive would eventually succeed him.
Mr. Weill, Mr. Redstone and Mr. Greenberg declined to comment, their press representatives said.
Top executives like these seem inclined to see themselves as tenured professors, management consultants said. And university professors with tenure are among the best protected groups of professional employees: they are virtually guaranteed jobs for as long as they can do them. 
George M. Kranc celebrated his 83rd birthday yesterday, but has no plans to retire as a professor at City College of New York. He has been teaching electrical engineering for more than half a century -- and still teaches three courses a semester -- but does not feel burned out. 
"You're a little bit like an actor on the stage," he said. "An actor doesn't like to retire. People listen to you. It's fun." He plans to continue for as long as he is physically able. "It is very difficult for them to get rid of me, unless they can prove that I'm not carrying out my duties," he said. 
Those reviews, by peers, take place regularly at some universities. "It would be a good idea if all organizations did this," Professor Bennis of U.S.C. said, simply to check up on the competence and performance of older workers.
After a life of working, the idleness of retirement can be a problem for anyone and is even the subject of pop culture -- witness how hard it is for Jack Nicholson, as a retired actuary in the movie "About Schmidt," to deal with time on his hands. For the intense people who climb to the top of organizations, that phenomenon is even worse. Their identity is tightly wound to their jobs.
Sidney Harman, now 84, was in his early 60's and fresh from a stint as deputy commerce secretary when, instead of heading for the beach, he bought back the company he had started a quarter-century before. Well into his 80's, he has run Harman International Industries, which makes audio speakers and sound systems for cars.
In 1998, Mr. Harman handed off the chief executive title, but he remains executive chairman and the company's highest-paid officer. He signs off on its quarterly financial statements and, he said, he writes monthly status reports for the directors and keeps up with the changing tastes of music lovers. His hearing, he added, is fine and unaided.
"THE principal reason that I want to stay and that other people advanced in years want to stay is it is this very work that energizes me," he said. "Absent it, I think that life would be pretty damned ordinary."
His life clearly is not: Mr. Harman said that he watched the Super Bowl with President Bill Clinton at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, flew home to Los Angeles the next morning and went straight to work.
It is just that kind of schedule that many corporate directors cite as a reason to limit the age of chief executives. The job has become too rigorous for people over 65, they argue.
Generally, chief executives are younger and their tenures are shorter, according to data compiled by Spencer Stuart, the executive search firm. The average age of chief executives of the 300 biggest companies has fallen to 56, from 59 in 1980. More notably, Spencer Stuart found, only 27 percent of those chief executives were 60 or older last year, down from 48 percent in 1980, and 19 percent were under 50, up from just 6 percent in 1980.
"As this job has gotten to be so bloody difficult because of all the pressures cascading around the C.E.O., people are tending to get out earlier and focusing on grooming their successors at an early age," Mr. Ogden said. Still, he added, "in many cases, they're not exactly thrilled about getting out of the way."
Chief executives fall into one of the narrow categories of employees who are not protected by the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act, said Lawrence Z. Lorber, a partner in the Washington office of Proskauer Rose, a law firm. Except for "bona fide executives" and "high policy makers," employees cannot be made to retire at a certain age, Mr. Lorber said.
Elderly employees can be fired for poor job performance, but those cases can be tricky to prove, said Peter N. Hillman, a partner at Chadbourne & Parke in New York.
"When somebody's 77 you better be darn sure when you're the employer that you have a solid, objective case," Mr. Hillman said. It would have to rest on detailed records of performance problems and of chances given to the employee to improve, he said.
Intentionally or not, most big employers send the "it's time to go" signal by building their benefit programs around a retirement age of 65. Beyond that age, employees generally stop accruing pension or other retirement benefits, consultants said, but some continue working because they need the paychecks.
To avoid litigation, companies frequently try to entice managers to leave earlier than they had planned by offering better benefits than they have earned, said Philip Simshauser, vice president of the Center for Executive Options in New York, an international consulting service that is part of the Thomson Corporation. This practice, known as "bridging" people to their maximum benefits, might involve, say, adding three years of service and three years to an employee's age when computing outgoing benefits, Mr. Simshauser said.
Still, charges of age discrimination have risen sharply the last three years, especially among white men over 50, according to the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. All told, the commission received 19,921 accusations of age discrimination last year, up 41 percent from 14,141 filings in 1999.
Professor David Noer, who coaches executives and teaches management at Elon University in North Carolina, said there was a generation gap in attitudes about retirement.
Many people over 50 "have put all of their psychological eggs in the organizational basket," he said, adding that "who they are is where they work."
And what are you if you don't work there anymore? The unpleasant answer, he said, is "not much."
Workers in their 30's and 40's tend not to be seduced by organizations and have accepted that a career will include twists and turns, Professor Noer said. Their identities are tied more closely to what they do than to where they work.
"Society is much more tolerant of alternative careers," he said. "What people need to understand is there are a lot of ways you can be relevant to the world without staying at '60 Minutes' or in your current job."
Professor Noer said attitudes also vary by industry. Many doctors are working past normal retirement age, and a shortage of nurses has kept some working until they need to use their carts as walkers, he said. But in mainstream manufacturing and sales, youth is still prized, he said. 
The media industry, however, seems more willing to accommodate older people who have established their own franchises, he said.
IN the magazine business, it is not uncommon for one person, usually an editor, to embody a brand, as Helen Gurley Brown did at Cosmopolitan. That can make transitions all the more delicate. Such editors have significant leverage and can often stay past what the publication's owners would choose.
Ms. Brown was the first and most durable example of the celebrity editor. She took over Cosmopolitan in 1965 and supercharged it with a formula of sexy feminism for young women that exploded into the biggest newsstand seller in America. But more than 30 years later in 1996, it was still Ms. Brown, then in her 70's, who was producing a magazine for readers in their 20's. Ms. Brown, who still wears miniskirts and was recently taped by the "Today" show taking tango lessons at 80, was not ready to retire, but Hearst Magazines officials felt it was a good time to make a transition. (Hearst has no mandatory retirement policy.)
"Why would you?" Ms. Brown said. "It is pretty heady stuff to be paid and compensated for doing something that you get so much recognition for. Besides, if you retire yourself, if you volunteer, you don't get that nice package." Ms. Brown continues to help develop Cosmo magazines around the world.
Personal branding is harder to establish in other areas, but it's possible. Consider the airline industry. Although the Federal Aviation Administration requires commercial pilots to retire at 60, Herbert D. Kelleher, the 71-year-old founder of Southwest Airlines stayed on as chief executive until mid-2001. Always a larger-than-life character to many passengers, he is still chairman, and he continues to oversee the company's schedule and fleet planning, particularly picking out new routes for the expanding carrier. He is also leading Southwest's lobbying efforts on Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: AOL's Need: A New Vision 

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
WHEN AOL bought Time Warner two years ago, the company's chairman, Stephen M. Case, told investors he hoped AOL Time Warner would become the most valuable company in the world, surpassing even Microsoft and General Electric. Instead, the next year will determine just how much smaller AOL Time Warner will end up.
 AOL Time Warner must wriggle out of a financial straitjacket of heavy debt and stagnant profits in part by selling some of its assets. Instead of debating the company's growth potential, investors have begun to ponder what its many marquee businesses, including Warner Brothers and Time Inc., might fetch if the company were broken apart. 
 Some shareholders worry that Richard D. Parsons, who became chief executive eight months ago and will add the chairmanship in May, is largely untested in the media business. His genial, understated style has won the loyalty of the company's executives and board after a brutal two years, but some shareholders and management experts are waiting to see if he can win back investors' confidence in the company's future. 
"All of the mechanisms for running the company have to be wrapped around a new vision," said Noel M. Tichy, author of "The Cycle of Leadership: How Great Leaders Teach Their Companies to Win" (HarperBusiness, 2002). "If Parsons does not do this with alacrity, he will end up like C. Michael Armstrong," the former chief executive of AT&T.
Mr. Parsons's financial forecast to Wall Street last week did not do much to allay investors' concerns. The company announced a surprisingly large write-off of $45 billion, an accounting charge to mostly reflect the declining value of the AOL division. Then Mr. Parsons disappointed many analysts and investors with the company's 2003 targets. Many analysts said they expected an 8 percent increase in its operating profit, but Mr. Parsons said that it would be flat. 
In an interview on Thursday, Mr. Parsons said the company was on track to bolster its balance sheet and restart its growth. "We have got to fix AOL, and we have got to maintain the other businesses," he said. "It gets us to where we need to be in the time frame we have to get there." 
The company's disappointing prognosis for the year was simply realism, he said. Even AOL Time Warner's most robust businesses, like its magazine division and entertainment studios, are already the biggest companies in mature, slow-growing industries, he said. That is why the company needs to reduce its debts so it can once again invest in new markets domestically and abroad. 
Mr. Parsons has told investors he sees many ways to raise cash and pay off its debts without a slip in its investment-grade credit rating. But he has not spelled out any of them, wary of overpromising or tipping his hand. 
The task of reviving AOL Time Warner is the latest in a string of unexpected turns in Mr. Parsons's own career, which began as a lawyer and political aide. His only previous experience as a chief executive was turning around the Dime Savings Bank after it fell into regulatory trouble. And his only hands-on experience running a media business was his three years overseeing AOL Time Warner's film and music divisions.
It was an unlikely path to the daunting challenge he now faces.
"It's sort of like Casey Stengel in his first year at the Mets," said Gerard R. Roche, the senior chairman of Heidrick & Struggles, an executive search firm. "If you remember, they were a bunch of boobs and Casey asked, 'Can anyone here play this game?' With AOL, it's 'Can anyone here run this company?' "
THE release last week of AOL Time Warner's year-end financial statement was a rough start. Many analysts had hoped that Mr. Parsons would restore the company's credibility after a series of unpleasant surprises that have marred its performance since the merger. But they were startled by the news that Time Warner Cable, unlike some more cautious competitors, had recorded advertising fees from new networks all at once instead of more gradually over a period of years. Now that the company is no longer adding new networks to its cable systems, its growth is slowing sharply because those fees are expected to fall, to $50 million this year from $130 million in 2002. 
"This happened under his watch," said one institutional investor who has sold his stock.
A company spokesman said the accounting policies were always disclosed to analysts, and the drop-off would affect only one year. Mr. Parsons's supporters within the company add that, like most of the company's problems, the cable division's accounting policies were in place before he took over. After two years of spin, his supporters say, Mr. Parsons is at least telling the truth.
And Mr. Parsons has won accolades from the company's executives and shareholders for naming as his deputies two managers who are respected by Wall Street. Don Logan, the chairman of the media group, previously ran the company's Time Inc. magazine division. Jeff Bewkes, the chairman of the entertainment group, used to head its HBO unit. Both Time Inc. and HBO have been among AOL Time Warner's most consistent performers in recent years, and this year they are the only two units expected to deliver continued strong growth.
That Mr. Parsons's two deputies have shinier media industry credentials than his own does not bother him. "There is no doubt in my mind that in Messrs. Logan and Bewkes we have two of the best and most proven and most respected operating executives in the media and entertainment universe," he said, "I see my job as to make sure that we have the best team on the field."
But with about $27 billion in debt -- soon to grow to more than $29 billion and already over the limits set by credit information services for its current investment-grade credit rating -- Mr. Parsons must be an adroit financier as well as a manager.
Some analysts, mainly looking for a bottom after the relentless fall of its stock price, have begun speculating about the possible gains from sales of AOL Time Warner's disparate parts. 
Such calculations may not be comforting. 
IN the depths of a bear market, there are few companies lining up to pay top dollar for even the most prestigious media businesses. By some estimates, the break-up value of the company is not much more than the stock's current price. 
Their estimates range from $13 to $17 a share; AOL Time Warner closed on Friday at $11.66, a slide of almost 85 percent since the merger was announced. 
Tom Wolzien, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said that if all of the company's divisions were sold at estimated current market values, they might fetch a total of about $83.1 billion, shrinking to about $68.4 billion, or $13.49 a share, after accounting for debt and other adjustments.
Those estimates also do not account for the potential capital gains taxes, which would be "monumental," said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting analyst at Lehman Brothers. 
Almost no analyst or big investor suggests that the company should splinter itself. Most investors believe that businesses like entertainment studios, cable networks and cable systems are worth more together than apart. 
Selling the AOL division remains a popular fantasy among executives from the Time Warner side of the company who lost much of the value of their company stock after the merger, but company executives and investment bankers maintain it would be foolish to sell it at the bottom without trying to turn it around.
Still, AOL Time Warner's obligations are swelling. Mr. Parsons has said he expects the company's debts to rise over the next few months as it takes on new loans for the construction of its new headquarters at Columbus Circle and a $2.1 billion payment to buy Comcast's minority stake in a cable industry partnership. 
The additions would bring its total debts to at least $29 billion. Increasingly impatient credit rating agencies have said the company is already over the debt limits of its current investment-grade credit rating. A slip in its credit rating could make it more expensive for the company to borrow and further undercut its stock.
LAST week, Mr. Parsons pledged to whittle down the company's debts to less than 2.7 times its cash flow, or about $24.5 billion, by the end of the year. By the end of 2004, that figure would decline to $20 billion. These promises mean the company needs to raise about $4 billion this year and another $4 billion the next. And that is a tall order for a company expecting no increase in its overall profits and a major division, AOL, still in decline.
The company has already started to search for buyers for some of its units. In the last few months, it has said that it hopes to sell a minority stake in its cable division to the public for at least $2.1 billion, possibly splitting additional proceeds with Comcast, its partner in the venture. It has begun steps to sell its half interests in two cable channels, Comedy Central and Court TV, which analysts say might together fetch as much as $2 billion. It has also put on the block its three money-losing Atlanta sports teams -- the Braves, the Hawks and the Thrashers -- which analysts say could raise about $750 million. And most recently it began shopping its book publishing division, which investment bankers estimate is worth over $400 million.
Together, these sales might raise more than $5 billion, enough to meet Mr. Parsons's budget for this year, if not the next. But all these potential sales remain uncertain in the currently choppy economy and stock market. There are few bidders for half stakes in cable networks besides the other partners, and there are few media companies eager to expand their investments in the slow-growing book publishing business. And money-losing sports teams appeal to a very limited number of buyers. The cable offering, in particular, will depend on market conditions and the outcome of a possible war with Iraq. 
Leveraged buyout investors have plenty of cash to invest if AOL puts assets up for sale and some funds are already looking at the book division. But in an uncertain economic environment, they want businesses with steady cash flow. AOL Time Warner's music, film and book units all depend on hits, where profits are erratic.
In the conference call with investors last week, however, Mr. Parsons said he remained confident that the company had plenty of options to bolster its balance sheet, including using some of its operating profit. "It will come from diverse sources, but we are committed to reduce our debts," he said, elaborating only to say that management will weigh chances to sell unspecified assets if the prices are right. 
Last week, he noted, AOL Time Warner sold its 8 percent stake in the satellite company Hughes Electronics for about $800 million. AOL paid $1.5 billion for the stake in 1999.
In an interview, Mr. Parsons also defended the company's combination of businesses. Operating the businesses together offered "strategic and defensive advantages that are fairly easy to see," Mr. Parsons said. For example, owning Warner Brothers studios guaranteed HBO access to a library of movies while owning Time Warner Cable assured HBO of access to subscribers. 
The same holds for AOL, Mr. Parsons said. "The first thing we have to do is we have to fix it," Mr. Parsons said. "Do I believe that we can do that? Yes. Do I believe that once we do that it will not only benefit from being a part of the AOL Time Warner family but will also benefit the other parts of the family? Yes, I believe it will."
That vision might not seem inspirational enough to some still hoping for the kinds of returns they saw a decade ago. But Mr. Parsons said he was focusing on long-term results, not public opinion.

HEADLINE: Meet the New Davos Man 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
WHATEVER happened to Davos Man?
 The genus of globe-trotting capitalists, first identified by the Harvard political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, migrates each winter to this Alpine resort to swap ideas about the future of business and the world. 
 The Davos Men and Women were at it again last week at the World Economic Forum, picking their way through the snowdrifts in Bally loafers, elbowing each other aside for face time with Bill Clinton at his Super Bowl party and yakking on cellphones that resemble the headsets worn by sales clerks at the Gap. 
But something was missing in the thin mountain air this year. Once brimming with confidence, the corporate chieftains were unsteady, fearful of a future darkened by war and a global economy that has defied all attempts at revival. Used to being agents of change, they seemed hostage to events over which they have no control.
Little was said about globalization, unless one counts the sessions devoted to international terrorism, attacks on the world's information network and geopolitics (the polite word for war).
The star speakers were not technology evangelists like Bill Gates or Michael S. Dell but two retired generals, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Wesley K. Clark, the former NATO commander. Mr. Powell presented the United States government's case for attacking Saddam Hussein. General Clark explained what an invasion of Iraq might look like -- a campaign every bit as high-tech as the launch of Windows 2000.
The beating of war drums drowned out the jeers of the antiglobalization protesters, although they, too, tried to get with the program. No longer vilifying Starbucks or McDonald's, they hammered President Bush and handed out fake dollar bills with pictures of tanks on them.
The anti-American sentiment was as palpable inside the conference, leaving some normally ebullient Americans flummoxed. 
"I don't know what to make of it," said Scott G. McNealy, the chairman of Sun Microsystems. "I come to Europe a lot on business, and these issues don't come up in conversations. Maybe it's because we're so focused on doing business."
Iraq intruded mainly in the intangible but important area of business confidence. Companies do not, as a rule, invest in times of uncertainty. With the possibility of spiking oil prices, and with stock markets quavering after every warning from the White House, Mr. McNealy's customers are in no mood to place new orders for Sun's computer workstations.
Nor is there any sign that the anemic European or Japanese economies will pick up the slack for the United States. 
"We need some help from other people in the world," said Charles O. Holliday Jr., the chairman of DuPont.
Antiglobalization activists paint the prototypical Davos Man as a prophet of free trade -- faithful to no creed, beholden to no values save those of the global market. Multinational corporations, they say, are like stateless governments, callously playinghavoc in the third world.
In introducing Mr. Powell, the conference organizer, Klaus Schwab, paid homage to this power, noting that the chief executives in the audience make their own foreign policy. But as the business elite listened quietly to Mr. Powell, it was clear that for now, at least, the policy that matters emanates from Washington, not from the boardrooms of McDonald's or Microsoft.

HEADLINE: Who Has the Hot Rods? 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Colin Powell finally has the goods on the evil dictator.
 He has spy satellite photos of trucks pulling up to buildings in the outlaw regime when inspectors aren't around, lots of bustling activity around those metal rods for the nukes threatening civilization. 
 Mr. Powell has all the evidence he needs to convince the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday that we are justified in making a pre-emptive strike on North Korea. 
Only one hitch: President Bush doesn't want to attack North Korea; he wants to contain North Korea.
He doesn't want to contain Iraq, he told reporters on Friday, because "after September the 11th, the doctrine of containment just doesn't hold any water, as far as I'm concerned."
Except when it comes to North Korea, where Condoleezza Rice has proposed a tailored containment that can "check Kim Jong Il."
The Bush administration has made fuzzy evidence against Saddam Hussein sound scarier than it is, and scary evidence against Kim Jong Il sound fuzzier than it is.
All week the Bushies did Cirque du Soleil contortions to show that we need to drop 3,000 precision bombs and missiles on Saddam's fedora right away because he might someday hook up with Al Qaeda and might someday cook up nuclear weapons. Not wanting to deflect attention from savaging Saddam, the administration played ostrich on North Korea until Friday, when the Navy sent Rummy an S.O.S. for more forces to spook the spooky Kim Jong Il.
President Bush, during his press conference with Tony Blair, warned that Saddam had "weeks, not months" before facing U.S. wrath, even as Mohammed ElBaradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned that it would be "weeks and months" before North Korea could begin churning out nukes faster than the chocolates hurtling down Lucy's conveyor belt.
Rattling off the diameters of nuclear parts, Bush aides argued that Mr. ElBaradei was wrong to say that Iraq's aluminum tubes were for making rockets, not nukes. Meanwhile, they claimed that the satellite evidence of Pyongyang's nuclear fuel rod activity was no big deal.
Some Bush aides wanted to rush to declassify spy photos of Iraqi trucks but were in no hurry to show photos of those North Korean trucks pulling up to the Yongbyon nuclear complex.
Mr. Powell will use intercepted conversations to prove that Iraq is deceiving the U.N. Newsweek reports that the conversations consist of snippets like "Move that" and "Can you believe they missed that?" 
So Iraq, lying about nascent nukes, cannot stand. But North Korea, brazenly proliferating nukes, can?
Mr. Bush has a point: that Saddam might become a merchant of mass destruction to terrorists. North Korea is already one of the biggest dealers in the weapons bazaar, selling Scud parts to Yemen and missile technology to Pakistan and Iran.
The one-legged Qaeda man who seems straight out of "The Fugitive" is part of an evidence bag on Iraq that is highly circumstantial. Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi may have had something to do with the killing of the American diplomat Laurence Foley, but there is no proof that Mr. Zarqawi is working with the Iraqis. He may have left Baghdad two months before the murder.
The president was asked pointedly by a British reporter if there was a tie between Saddam and the 9/11 hijackers. He did not claim one.
Mr. Bush shouldn't reach for strained rationales. We're going to war against Saddam because we can. (If we go after Kim Jong Il, he could destroy Seoul.) We're going to war because conservatives will be happy only when they have a John Wayne ending to Desert Storm and make U.S. foreign policy less about realpolitik and more about muscularity and morality. We're going to war because we're a nation with a short attention span; we want to strike back at some enemy, and it is too hard to find Osama. (The Brits now say they and the U.S. knew Al Qaeda was working on a dirty bomb even before 9/11.)
No one will miss Saddam. But as the administration inflates Iraq, it should not deflate other threats: North Korea, Al Qaeda, the deficit, the freaked economy and the woeful failure to secure the ports, skies and borders of America from attack.
After Mr. Bush defenestrates Saddam and detangles Iraq's tribal chaos, Kim Jong Il and his six-pack of nukes will still be craving the American president's attention.

HEADLINE: The World; 
Iran Looks at a War With Iraq and Sees Its Own

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: TEHRAN 

 BODY:
AS Iranians contemplate an American-led war against Iraq, they have been forced to confront a demon from their past: their own war with Iraq never ended, either legally or psychologically. So it is profoundly disconcerting for Iranians to anticipate that their archenemy, the United States, may bring down Saddam Hussein after they could not.
 Fifteen years after the fighting stopped, Iran and Iraq have a cease-fire but no peace treaty or border demarcation. Both still hold prisoners of war. Iraq restricts Iranian pilgrims' visits to Najaf and Kerbala, the holiest shrines in Shiite Islam. And Iran has held on to Iraqi warplanes that Mr. Hussein sent for safekeeping while he fought to keep Kuwait in 1991. (He had the misimpression that Iran would send them back.) 
 More seriously, the psychological wounds have not healed. The war was fought largely on Iranian soil, sometimes with poison gas, and 16 of Iran's 24 provinces became targets of Iraqi bombs and missiles. The war crushed Iran's economy, sent legions of teenage "martyrs" to their deaths, killed at least 300,000 Iranians and wounded from 600,000 to 750,000.
From 1980, when Saddam Hussein attacked Iran, to 1988, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of Iran's revolution, told his soldiers that theirs was a holy war between Islam and blasphemy that would not end until Iraq too was an Islamic republic.
Then, one day in 1988, Tehran radio read a statement in the ayatollah's name stating that he would submit to God's will and accept a United Nations peace plan -- a decision, the statement said, that "was more deadly than taking poison."
The announcement was so sudden that officials did not have time to remove the war banners and paintings in every city and town. Ayatollah Khomeini promised to explain one day why he had made the decision, but he died first; his people still wonder.
That disconnect has prevented the wounds from healing and left a sense of unfinished business. "We haven't solved a single problem that we have with Saddam's regime," said Sadegh Zibakalam, a political scientist.
There is also a sense of betrayal; people wonder about the value of wartime sacrifice itself. "The words of that broadcast were so empty," said an Iranian government official, who heard the statement at a prison camp in northern Iraq. "All the soldiers cried. We cried so hard that even the Iraqi soldier watching us from the window cried with us."
The official, who endured beatings and electric shock from his Iraqi jailers, was not released until two years after the truce. And he, like many Iranians, was left with a deep ambivalence about the war's meaning. "I feel proud that I was able to defend my country," he said, "even if I have been cheated."
In that sentiment is a clue to how difficult it is now for Iranians, and for their ruling clerics, to face the prospect that the United States, the Great Satan they grew up with, will oust the tyrant that their holy war could not defeat. 
In fact, Iranians of all classes express terror, not simply at the prospect of an American military presence on their border, but at the likelihood of renewed warfare itself. In particular they fear that Mr. Hussein might lash out at Iran just to keep it from benefiting from the war, in much the same way he set Kuwait's oil fields afire when his armies retreated in 1991. 
Iran has already begun to build makeshift shelters on the border to house what it expects to be an influx of hundreds of thousands of refugees. They have experience with that kind of suffering too: the Soviet sweep into Afghanistan sent nearly two million Afghan refugees fleeing into Iran, bringing with them drugs, crime and unemployment in the same years that Iran was battling Iraq.
Iran itself is not prepared to mobilize, and no one is talking seriously here of asking a new generation to make sacrifices, should war come again. The population, many Iranians say, would simply not tolerate it. 
"My father was a revolutionary and spent the best years of his life from the age of 21 to 29 in war zones," said Amin Bozorgian, a 21-year-old student activist. "He was wounded by chemical weapons and has serious lung problems. He never talks about it. I feel like the bombs of the chemical weapons burst in our lives, and they keep on bursting. The government dragged a war that could have ended in two years into eight years. We're all somehow damaged by that war. And all the war talk now is like picking a scab and opening a wound."
Such feelings are widespread even though they run counter to the official view of the Islamic republic. For years after the war, the government campaigned to keep alive the cult of martyrdom and sacrifice, and even today the war is portrayed as an honorable effort. The Martyrs' Foundation, which gives subsidies to disabled veterans and the families of the war dead, continues to hang huge paintings of war heroes on main thoroughfares of cities, often near commercial billboards.
The United States has sent assurances to the Iranians through private channels that the installation of an American-led government in Baghdad is not part of a larger plot to encircle them, though some American analysts have said that the removal of Saddam Hussein would boost democratic forces in Iran.
On the other hand, some hard-liners here expect that the specter of attack from American forces next door might be the one thing that could unite Iran again against an external enemy. 
"We know that if America attacks, all the divisions in Iran will disappear," said Amir Mohebian, political editor of the conservative newspaper Resalaat. "You will see that after the first bullet the reformers will chant the most radical slogans against America. And politically, this would not be to our disadvantage."

HEADLINE: The World: A Calling to Heal; 
Getting Religion on AIDS

BYLINE:  By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AMERICA loves a moral crusade, which is precisely what President Bush offered the nation last week with the announcement that he wants to triple American spending on global AIDS, to $15 billion over the next five years.
 "We have a chance to achieve a more compassionate world for every citizen," Mr. Bush declared on Friday, elaborating on a plan unveiled in his State of the Union address. "America believes deeply that everybody has worth, everybody matters, everybody was created by the Almighty, and we're going to act on that belief and we'll act on that passion." 
 Suddenly, George Bush sounded more like Jimmy Carter than Ronald Reagan. 
It was a turnabout for a president who, in the eyes of many advocates for AIDS patients, has until now seemed to shut his eyes to the pandemic's horrors. But other Republican leaders, notably Senator Bill Frist, the new majority leader, had already embraced the global AIDS cause on humanitarian grounds. 
So had the Rev. Franklin Graham, who delivered the invocation at Mr. Bush's inauguration. Mr. Graham, who runs Samaritan's Purse, a Christian relief organization, said the other day that he sees it as his duty "as a follower of Jesus Christ" to "bring healing, to bring love, to bring compassion" to the sick and dying. 
"The administration isn't afraid of rock stars and student activists -- they are used to us," Bono, the Irish rock star and anti-AIDS crusader, said in an interview. "But they are nervous of soccer moms and church folk. Now when soccer moms and church folk start hanging around with rock stars and activists, then they really start paying attention."
The sheer numbers of Africa's AIDS epidemic are staggering -- 30 million people infected, including three million children under age 15 -- and even Mr. Bush's staunchest critics agree that his initiative represents what the economist Jeffrey D. Sachs calls a "historic breakthrough." 
To understand the magnitude of the plan, recall that in 1999 President Bill Clinton managed to persuade Congress to increase global AIDS spending from $125 million to just $225 million. Mr. Bush, however, has strong geopolitical, as well as moral, reasons to spend more. With the buildup to war in Iraq, he recognizes that he must show the world what America stands for, as well as what it stands against. "It's the notion of needing to deploy weapons of mass salvation, together with weapons of mass destruction," Professor Sachs said.
But for a conservative Republican administration, any initiative involving AIDS is tricky business. A moral battle, by definition, involves notions of right and wrong. And the same "church folk" who applaud Mr. Bush's compassion may also find themselves uneasy when confronted with its details. 
It is one thing to offer live-saving medicines to the dying, quite another to promote AIDS prevention, which involves discussions of multiple sex partners and condoms. This is, after all, the same administration that has insisted that AIDS prevention efforts in the United States stress abstinence until marriage and that banned aid to international family-planning programs if they happened to permit abortions. 
Mr. Bush avoided such controversies last June when, instead of offering the kind of far-reaching initiative announced last week, he proposed $500 million to prevent infected mothers in Africa and the Caribbean from passing the virus that causes AIDS on to their babies. 
Senator Richard J. Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who has long argued for more money to combat global AIDS, said he was surprised last week to see the White House abandon its focus on mother-to-child transmission, which doesn't involve issues of sexual behavior. 
"That was the safest course to follow," Mr. Durbin said. "It was not politically charged. It didn't involve any reference to gay sex or the use of condoms."
The new initiative almost certainly will. 
Aimed at 12 African nations, as well as Haiti and Guyana, its goal is to prevent seven million new infections, provide treatment and care for 10 million infected people and orphans, and offer anti-retroviral drugs for two million people. Slightly more than half the money will pay for drugs; 15 percent will pay for treatment and care; and the rest, White House officials say, will go toward prevention, including abstinence education, media campaigns and, yes, condom distribution.
In some respects, the initiative, modeled after a program developed in Uganda, dovetails neatly with Mr. Bush's conservative views. The Ugandan effort relies on what is known as the "ABC approach." The message is: First, abstain. If you can't abstain, be faithful. If you can't be faithful, use a condom. 
Edward C. Green, a medical anthropologist at Harvard School of Public Health, has followed the Ugandan program, which began in 1986. He offers the following statistics as evidence that "partner reduction," as he calls it, is the single most effective way of reducing the spread of AIDS.
At the peak of the Ugandan epidemic, in 1991, an estimated 21 percent of Ugandans were infected, as measured among pregnant women. By 1995, 95 percent of Ugandans from age 15 to 49 reported having either no sexual partners in the previous year or just one partner. 
By 2001, the infection rate had dropped to 6 percent -- a dip experts say reflects a reduction in high-risk behavior, but also the fact that large numbers of people had died. 
"The A-word, abstinence, has become a political lightning rod," said Professor Green, whose views have made him a hot property among conservatives in Washington these days. "As soon as my colleagues hear it, they say, 'This is the Bush administration moralizing.' I wish we didn't even have that word in our vocabulary."
Conservatives have another reason to like Mr. Bush's approach: the White House says religious groups and faith-based organizations will be eligible for some of the money. That pleases Mr. Graham, who notes that a good deal of medical work in Africa is already done by church-related hospitals and clinics. "The church," he says, "should be on the front row of this agenda." 
But this sets off alarms among some groups, including American Muslims, who were infuriated when Mr. Graham, more than once, denounced Islam as a "very evil and wicked religion." 
W E are in favor of increased spending on AIDS drugs for those who can't afford them," said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group. "But we would be greatly concerned if taxpayer money goes to a group headed by Franklin Graham, who has a long history of hostility toward Muslims and Islam." 
Before the program even begins, it will have to get past Congress. 
In the Senate, Dr. Frist and others are preparing to introduce legislation this week authorizing the initiative. Advocates, meanwhile, are plotting their next moves. But more important than the fight over details, they said, is the fact that the president is using the authority of his office to take up their cause.
"This is a moment where the president of the United States has drawn a line in the sand," Bono said. "If they want to paint the drugs red, white and blue, I don't care. And neither do the two million people who are about to go on them."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DIPLOMACY; 
Europe Loses Advocate With Powell's Iraq Shift

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, once viewed by Europeans as their special advocate in the Bush administration, has taken them aback with what many see as his conspicuous shift toward war with Iraq -- with or without Europe's cooperation. 
 As he has become the leading advocate of a wait-no-longer approach to removing President Saddam Hussein of Iraq from power, Mr. Powell has stopped being the figure Europeans were accustomed to seeing: a sort of un-Bush, certainly an un-Rumsfeld. 
 "They thought that to be in cahoots with Powell was to have a powerful voice in the Bush administration," Christoph Bertram, director of research for the German Foundation for Society and Politics, said of many in Europe's foreign policy establishments. 
Europeans still see Mr. Powell as a voice that articulates how they feel, even as he prepares to present intelligence evidence at the Security Council on Wednesday that Iraq is hiding weapons of mass destruction. But Mr. Powell has lately been showing impatience with the Germans and the French. He has called the United Nations weapons inspection regime virtually irrelevant. He has warned that the United States will proceed against Iraq even if Security Council refuses to pass a new resolution approving military action. 
Mr. Powell may still be regarded by many Europeans as the most widely respected figure in the Bush administration, one, for example, who did not dismiss the recalcitrant countries on this continent as "old Europe," as Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld did a week ago, provoking a great deal of both outraged and wry commentary here. 
At the same time, the Europeans have been surprised by what they see as his altered role, from Europe's sole senior administration voice in the White House to the administration's most prestigious and trusted advocate in Europe.
For much of the time since last fall, when the United States began pressing for military action against Iraq, Mr. Powell was, in the view of Europeans like the Germans and the French, a natural ally. He was, after all, the author of the Powell Doctrine, the post-Vietnam War idea that the United States should only go to war when its vital interests are at stake and overwhelming force can be exerted on the battlefield. 
The French in particular saw Mr. Powell as a friend for having pushed the administration down the road of multilateralism, reining in the impulse of figures epitomized by Mr. Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney. 
Mr. Powell was seen as responsible for getting the Iraq issue before the Security Council and for negotiating the resolution, unanimously approved by the 15-member Council, that created the arms inspection regime.
Even now that Mr. Powell has taken a conspicuously more hawkish stand, as reflected in his speech at the Davos World Economic Forum a week ago, he has not lost his standing as the American official closest to the European way of looking at things. 
When Europeans complain about the moves of the Bush administration that most upset them -- the rebuke to the Kyoto Treaty on the environment, for example, or the rejection of the International Criminal Court -- the name Powell is never mentioned among the names of officials who are less universally admired here: Mr. Rumsfeld, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz, or Richard Perle, chief of the Defense Policy Board, which advises the Pentagon.
"The loyal Mr. Powell no longer sees the Iraq matter as a question that is open," Mr. Bertram said. "At the same time, he can be trusted to bring into the discussion the implications for Europe of a war."
Mr. Powell's role in the debate, aside from keeping the White House informed of European leaders' political problems, represented two principles that are held as important in both halves of a Europe that is divided on the question of Iraq. 
First, Mr. Powell is seen as having recognized the European conviction that for the United States to have acted on its own would have grievously damaged the Atlantic alliance, enhanced their Lone Ranger, six-gun image of the United States and intensified anti-American feelings among the European public. 
In addition, by taking the Iraq matter to the United Nations, Mr. Powell chose what Europeans accepted as the sole course of action possible to give an eventual war against Iraq an aura of legitimacy. 
Essentially, European policy analysts say, only a Security Council resolution would enable some governments in Europe to justify to their own electorates joining the United States in a war. Put another way, Europeans are likely to recognize Iraq's noncompliance with United Nations resolutions as justifying war against Mr. Hussein; they are less likely to see Iraq's weapons programs alone as justifying that course of action. 
"There's only one way to use force, aside from the use of force in self-defense, and that is through the U.N., the Security Council," said Karl Kaiser, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations. "From the point of view of international order, that's the only way to do it. It gives it a very powerful legitimation." 
While Mr. Powell is still given credit for pressing the case for multilateralism, the gap has been growing between him and Europe's most recalcitrant countries, Germany and France, and there has been a personal element to that schism. 
On Jan. 20, for example, at a meeting of the Security Council called to discuss terrorism, Mr. Powell was said to be furious when the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin, who presided over the meeting, turned the discussion to Iraq and made a declaration about the need, in the French view, to give the United Nations inspections regime much more time.
When Mr. Powell said in a television interview that Mr. Villepin's gesture was "unfortunate," the French daily Le Figaro declared that to be "an elegant way of saying that he had been caught in a trap." 
The German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung put the matter this way: "Colin Powell, until now, the dutifully moderate secretary of state, has now given up all restraint and publicly shown anger at his French colleague, Dominique de Villepin, who tricked him at the United Nations." 
In an interview with The Financial Times in London a few days later, Mr. Powell said, "I have yet to hear from my European colleagues as to when they would be satisfied with respect to inspections." 
Mr. Powell added, "The issue is not inspectors; the issue is Iraq." 
When Mr. Powell went to the Davos forum in Switzerland last week to deliver a speech in which he said time was running out for Iraq, the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, was conspicuous by his absence. He chose just that moment to travel to four Middle Eastern countries, where he made several comments reiterating German opposition to military action. 
"From the point of view of Colin Powell, it must be an absurd comparison," the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel said in an editorial last week. "He takes the trouble to travel halfway around the world to spend two days in Switzerland and canvass support of the Iraq policy of his country. His colleague Joschka Fischer, however, despite being only an hour's flight away, decides instead at precisely this moment to start his own peace campaign, about which even optimists are unsure what it can achieve."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 6, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about European attitudes toward Secretary of State Colin L. Powell misidentified the site of an interview reported on Jan. 25 in The Financial Times, in which he expressed irritation with some European counterparts who wanted to give United Nations weapons inspectors in Iraq more time. It took place in Washington, not London.

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: THE PRESIDENT; 
Bush's Words to the Nation Mix Sadness and Resolve

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
President Bush rushed back to the White House today from Camp David to assume once more the role of comforter in chief, this time to a nation already jittery and divided over the prospect of war with Iraq.
 Mr. Bush was told of the breakup of the space shuttle Columbia within minutes of its happening by Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, who was watching the re-entry on television in his cabin at Camp David. Mr. Card, who also told Mr. Bush of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, called the White House situation room and NASA before informing the president. 
 Mr. Bush spoke to NASA's administrator, Sean O'Keefe, about 10:30 a.m., and then roared by motorcade back to Washington. From behind his desk in the Oval Office, he phoned the families of the seven astronauts who had been aboard the Columbia.
He told the families, who were silent and holding hands as they listened to him over a speakerphone in a conference room at the Kennedy Space Center, that there were millions of Americans praying for them and that he wished he could be there to hug and cry with and comfort them, a White House official said.
Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, returned to the White House from Camp David ahead of the president, and she coordinated phone calls to him from other world leaders who wanted to express condolences. They included Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel, whose nation had watched the shuttle closely because it carried the first Israeli to travel into space, Col. Ilan Ramon.
At 2 p.m., Mr. Bush spoke to the nation from the Cabinet Room with tears in his eyes, a break in his voice and a strong religious character to his remarks. He cited the "high and noble purpose" of space exploration and the "courage and daring and idealism" of the astronauts.
It was left to Mr. Bush to speak plainly what was already clear: "There are no survivors."
But he said the space program would go on. "Mankind is led into the darkness beyond our world by the inspiration of discovery and the longing to understand," he said.
He quoted the prophet Isaiah and paraphrased Scripture, saying, "The same Creator who names the stars also knows the names of the seven souls we mourn today."
The vivid and endlessly replayed television pictures of the orbiter tearing into pieces high above Texas not only revived memories of the loss of the Challenger. They also seemed sure to dominate the national consciousness for days or weeks just as Mr. Bush is stepping up his efforts to convince the country and the world that there is no choice but to force a quick and final showdown with Iraq.
The president made no reference to Iraq or anything else but the loss of the shuttle in his remarks. In mixing comfort and sadness with resolve, Mr. Bush struck a balance that presidential scholars and political consultants said he would have to maintain in the coming days and weeks as he juggles a critical moment in foreign policy with the aftermath of an unrelated tragedy.
"It serves as a reminder of the centrality of the presidency," said Fred Greenstein, a presidential scholar at Princeton. "He's got to rally the nation on Iraq. It seems to me possible that out of this could come a certain amount of inspiration."
In that sense, Mr. Bush's role today as spokesman for and healer to the nation intersected with his role as head of state. Among the foreign leaders who called to express condolences were President Jacques Chirac of France, who has sought to give United Nations weapons inspections in Iraq more time than Mr. Bush seems willing to allow, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whose support would be crucial to building broad international support for confronting Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Bush also spoke to President Vicente Fox of Mexico and Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada.
To the shocked country, Mr. Bush's role today recalled that played by President Ronald Reagan on the day the Challenger shuttle exploded in 1986. Mr. Reagan postponed the State of the Union address, which had been scheduled for that night, and spoke to the nation from the Oval Office. He likened the Challenger's crew to the courageous explorers of history and closed by declaring that they had "slipped the surly bonds of earth" to "touch the face of God."
Mr. Bush's task in comforting the country is made more difficult by the likelihood that he will soon be calling on a nation that is already coping with the aftermath of Sept. 11 and a weak economy to be ready to send its troops into battle.
Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian, said wartime presidents frequently must reassure the nation that setbacks accompany triumphs and that Mr. Bush was essentially doing that now.
"In foreign policy, Americans are affected more than anything else by the way the president frames the issues of war and peace," Mr. Beschloss said. "If a president says something is so important that we need to go to war, most Americans are emotionally inclined to accept that. The same thing happens when a president is trying to explain a national tragedy."

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: THE TRAUMA; 
Another Blow and More Loss for an Already Anxious Nation

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
For Texans awakened by the "boom-boom," it was the sound of the sky falling. For the clinical voice of NASA's Mission Control, it was a "contingency." For Americans already grappling with a confluence of threatening events, the instinctive reaction was, "What next?"
 Like the space shuttle Challenger disaster 17 years ago this week and the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the disintegration of the shuttle Columbia played out in real time before a nationwide television audience, sparking many of the same unsettled feelings. Only because the breakup began some 40 miles above the earth could the instinct to think of terrorism be repressed. 
 But to a nation still struggling with the aftermath of the most devastating terrorist attack in its history and the abiding threat of another, plus a sluggish economy, nuclear tension with North Korea and the prospect of war with Iraq, this morning's disaster was an especially harsh blow.
"The cause in which they died will continue," President Bush vowed in remarks to the nation from the White House this afternoon. "Mankind is led into the darkness beyond our world by the inspiration of discovery and the longing to understand. Our journey into space will go on." 
When the Challenger exploded on takeoff on Jan. 28, 1986, President Ronald Reagan sought to reassure schoolchildren captivated by the presence on the mission of Christa McAuliffe, who was to have been the first teacher in space.
"We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun," Mr. Reagan said, adding: "I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the faint-hearted. It belongs to the brave."
Mr. Bush will surely need to summon all the courage he can muster -- and more important, summon the nation's -- in the days and weeks ahead. For even as he tries to rally anxious Americans and doubting allies for a war, he will face a new, if predictable, challenge: public demands for answers and political demands for accountability.
This afternoon, the NASA administrator, Sean O'Keefe, pledged an immediate internal review of mission STS-107, as well as an outside inquiry by an independent "mishap investigation board." Mr. O'Keefe said relevant flight data in NASA's computers was already being secured.
The mourning will come first, of course.
At a briefing late this afternoon, NASA's shuttle program manager, Ron Dittemore, summed up the intensity of feeling after 113 shuttle flights that the public has come to take all but for granted. 
"It's more than a job," Mr. Dittemore said. "This is a passion for us. Human space flight is a passion. It's an emotional event. And when we work together, we work together as family members. And we treat each other much that way." He added: "We understand the risks that are involved in human space flight. And we know that these risks are manageable, but we also know that they're serious and can have deadly consequences."
Unlike the Challenger, which exploded over the ocean, the Columbia fell to earth this morning in fiery and potentially toxic bits over the cities and towns of Mr. Bush's home state, like a scene from "War of the Worlds." NASA spokesmen warned the public not to touch any debris but to report it instead to law enforcement authorities.
In a twist of nomenclature that would seem plausible only in fiction, a craft carrying Col. Ilan Ramon of the Israeli Air Force apparently broke up near an East Texas town called Palestine.
By late morning, NASA was lowering flags to half-staff, and by evening the Germany Embassy here was doing the same, despite the bitter disagreement with the United States over a possible war with Iraq.
Televisions that had been full of Saturday morning cartoons were alive with charts, drawings and the endless replays of the shuttle's shockingly wrong multiple vapor trails as it streaked at about 18 times the speed of sound toward a landing in Florida after a science mission. CNN reached out for a somber telephone interview with Walter Cronkite, the former CBS anchor who marked the first moon landing with an on air "Oh, boy!"
John Glenn, the first American to orbit the earth 41 years ago, and his wife, Annie, had just turned on their television to watch the landing. Mr. Glenn, who flew on the shuttle Discovery in 1998, said that when the scheduled landing time passed, he knew it was big trouble.
"I was as shocked as everyone else, you are not immune to that." The space program would go on, he said, but added: "It is so sad for the families."
Government officials said that there were no indications of terrorism and that the shuttle was out of range of surface-to-air missiles. Whatever the cause, there was no possibility of an emergency landing or ejection by the astronauts after the craft got in trouble at 200,000 feet, moving at 12,500 miles an hour.
In the initial aftermath of the Challenger disaster, the national and official mood was numbness. Only later did it become apparent that NASA had long had evidence of the very vulnerability that caused that accident, the O-rings on the shuttle's solid fuel rockets, which tended to become brittle and shrink in cold weather like that on the morning of the Challenger's ill-fated launching. Engineers had warned of the possibility just hours before the launching.
So, too, in the days after Sept. 11, 2001, there was national unity and great reluctance to question the government missteps or intelligence failures that might have left the nation vulnerable to such brutal attack. But those questions have since surfaced increasingly, and many remain unanswered.
But for the moment, today there was only shock.
Democratic leaders of the House of Representatives, meeting at a Pennsylvania resort to plan strategy for confronting President Bush on taxes, Medicare and the rest of his domestic agenda, instead began to pray.
"We thought that matters we were dealing with were of the greatest seriousness," said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader. "But it isn't of the greatest urgency for us to discuss them right now."

HEADLINE: Bush Budget Plan for '04 Has Higher Benefits for Many, Along With Deficits 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1 

 BODY:
The budget that President Bush sends to Congress on Monday would expand the military, create a major new social entitlement, energize the economy and, most likely, produce big deficits for the foreseeable future. 
 The $2.25 trillion plan would offer something for almost everybody. It would provide modest tax refunds up front and much bigger tax cuts down the road. It would give the elderly a permanent new right to government-paid prescription drugs. It would provide more money for the armed forces, for domestic security, for medical research and for foreign aid. 
 Not since the early days of Ronald Reagan's presidency has an administration harbored such bold ambitions and such a lack of concern about red ink. White House officials concede that deficits could top $300 billion this year and next, and the budget will probably not project a return to surpluses in the next five years. 
But as stark as that outlook will be, it will still leave out the costs for a long list of other measures.
White House officials said this week that they would propose an increase of roughly $16 billion for military spending in the 2004 fiscal year, but they also conceded that they might ask for additional billions in the months ahead even if the country does not fight a war with Iraq.
"It's possible," said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. "Why could it happen even if there is not a war? The history of defense spending has been one of surge and purge, where you waste money on the way up and on the way down. The president is trying to force the hard choice" to maintain steady growth, Mr. Daniels said.
If the country does goes to war, Mr. Bush plans to ask Congress for additional billions to cover those costs as well.
The president's budget will also leave out other big new liabilities linked to his tax plans. The budget will include Mr. Bush's proposal for tax-advantaged individual retirement programs. But the tax cuts will not show up in his budget, which lays out costs for the next five years, because contributions to the savings plans will not cut a taxpayer's current taxes. The tax cuts will only occur as people retire and start to withdraw the profits that accumulate, which will be tax free.
Nor will the budget include the huge costs of Mr. Bush's call to make his tax cuts from 2001 permanent. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that cost at $785 billion over 10 years, but almost none of those costs will show up until nearly the end of the decade.
Mr. Bush's Democratic opponents in Congress are already starting to attack the budget as "reckless" and "irresponsible," and House Democrats have calculated that the sum total of Mr. Bush's tax plans would add $1.7 trillion in debt by 2011.
But unlike many budgets in the past, which were torpedoed by opposition lawmakers, Mr. Bush's plan has a very strong chance of surviving largely intact. For the first time in years, Republicans control not only the White House but also both houses of Congress.
Having won control of both houses in November, Republicans say they will hew closely to Mr. Bush's line and press their advantage for everything it is worth.
"The president's budget will be one that, with very few exceptions, we have all been writing for the last six or eight years," said Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the House Budget Committee. "So this year, you're going to see real attention to the House version of special education, of transportation, of Medicare. They have consulted with us along the way."
Most of the real haggling will take place in the Senate, where Republicans have a paper-thin majority and where many moderate Republicans have their own misgivings about major elements of the president's tax cuts.
Even so, lawmakers and political analysts say the broad thrust of Mr. Bush's plan is likely to survive.
"People used to say that a president's budget was dead on arrival," said Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "That is certainly not the case now."
But having won the power to construct a budget with little interference, Republicans can also be attacked for the deficits that ensue -- and Democrats plan to make sure that they are.
"Now that they're in a position to impose their own budget, they control everything," said Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee. "The tragedy of it is that they're using their power to take off into the deficit swamp in a major way."
White House officials have already telegraphed the broad parameters of their budget. It would increase discretionary spending -- programs that are not locked in by standing legal obligations, as Social Security is, or that stem from interest payments on the national debt -- by about 4 percent, to about $790 billion.
Defense spending, excluding the possible costs of a war, would climb about $17 billion, or 4.4 percent, to $399 billion. Domestic security programs, from the Federal Bureau of Investigation to the Customs Service, would increase to $40 billion from $34 billion.
Administration officials say that nondefense discretionary spending, which includes education, housing, environmental programs and medical research, would climb by about 3 percent.
That would be slightly faster than the rate of inflation, which administration officials predict will remain well below 2 percent.
But Congressional Democrats say the plan squeezes all but a few favored government programs and forces many to fall behind. They note that a 4 percent increase in spending works out to an increase of about $30 billion. 
With defense and domestic security accounting for about $23 billion of that increase, Democrats say only $7 billion is left to spread around all other discretionary programs.
White House officials have been conservative about projecting tax revenues. Instead of assuming robust economic growth and a big rebound in revenues, they assume very modest growth and no increase in revenues.
Republican lawmakers and White House officials say the looming deficits pose little threat, because they are much smaller as a percentage of the total economy than the deficits under President Reagan or the first President Bush.
They also argue that the shortfalls so far are the result of the economic downturn, not Mr. Bush's 2001 tax cut, and say the best way to reduce deficits is to cut taxes and stimulate economic growth.
"A balanced budget is a priority for this president," Mr. Daniels said in an interview this week. "But it cannot be the only priority. Winning the war on terrorism and reinvigorating the economy are higher priorities."
Mr. Nussle, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the goal of a balanced budget was no longer the "holy grail" it once was.
"There is much more to being fiscally responsible than just some green-eyeshade version of balance," he said this week. "A growing economy is also a very important index."
These days, it is Democrats who are wringing their hands over deficits, although they often seem beleaguered.
"The Republicans will probably give us all of an hour to debate the budget on the floor, so we'll just have to appeal to the public," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. "We'll have to have press conferences and hearings of our own, and make sure that people understand the deficit isn't just an abstraction."
President Bush's biggest problem may be moderate Republicans. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has made it clear he is at most lukewarm about Mr. Bush's proposal to eliminate taxes on stock dividends and openly hostile to the administration's reported plan to offer prescription drug benefits only to people who sign up with health maintenance organizations.
With only a two-vote majority in the Senate, and not enough votes to block a Democratic filibuster, Mr. Bush does not have much room for dissent within his ranks.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 4, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about the 2004 federal budget referred incorrectly to the costs of making President Bush's 2001 tax cuts permanent. While most of those costs would occur after the plan's five-year span, the document indeed includes a 10-year estimate that puts the cost of the 2001 tax cuts at $588 billion. The accounting was not omitted from the budget.

HEADLINE: Greenwich Journal; 
In Racial Parable With Local Setting, Some See Reality, Others a Cartoon

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., Feb. 1 

 BODY:
An odd thing happened to David Brown on Wednesday night moments after he left a spirited discussion of race in this gilded suburb.
 Mr. Brown, who is 71 and black, was pulled over by the police almost as soon as he started up his white Volkswagen Beetle. As the patrolman was quick to point out, a taillight was broken. But would a white man have been stopped? He and everyone else who saw the stop wondered. Was this racial profiling? "It happens," said Mr. Brown, who is still undecided on just what to read into his experience. 
 The question took on particular resonance here because Showtime is running a new Spike Lee production set in Greenwich, "Good Fences," Sunday night at 8. More fable than documentary, the movie is a simultaneously probing and comic look at racism in affluent American society and the problems and afflictions of an emerging black elite.
The movie portrays the experience of Tom and Mabel Spader, an upwardly mobile black couple played by Danny Glover and Whoopi Goldberg, who move their family into one of Greenwich's finest homes in the 1970's, the moment Tom's legal career takes off. 
Far from perfect and desperate to get ahead, the Spaders are as obsessed with race as the people around them. They soon become part of a world in which race plays out in shadows and whispers; it is not characterized by the vicious strain of racism once more common in the South, but it is not the land of enlightenment, either.
As one might expect regarding a movie about diversity, reactions from the two dozen or so local residents who watched a preview Wednesday were all over the lot. Some saw something cartoonish that, they said, had no bearing on life in Greenwich. Others said it could have been their own story. Some said the movie was distasteful because the characters had bad values. Others said that was the point.
"It was like we all saw a different movie," said Brenda Stiers, the executive director of the Y.W.C.A., where the preview was shown.
In a town that many residents feel is unfairly picked on because of its wealth, about the only thing everyone agreed on was that the film could have been set anywhere affluent people live. The film's director, Ernest R. Dickerson, acknowledged as much by shooting much of the movie in Toronto for economic reasons.
"It's crystal-clear that the movie is not really set in Greenwich," said Dorothy Nins, a local pastor's wife who is black and heads a youth council. "It could have been any town in America with the same socioeconomic status. It's Rich White Town, U.S.A." 
Roy Lee, a retired chemistry teacher who moved to Greenwich in 1964, said he could relate to the fears of a black man moving to an overwhelmingly white suburb. He said his was the second African-American family to settle on his block. He, too, was concerned that his neighbors "saw us as possibly having more coming behind us, sort of an invasion of blacks." 
There has hardly been a mass influx of blacks into Greenwich, and those who have come have tended to be people like the singer Diana Ross or the New York Knick Allan Houston. Greenwich has just 1,107 blacks in a population of 61,101 people, according to the 2000 census. The number has dropped since the 1990 census, when 1,280 blacks were counted.
Still, residents say the town is more diverse than the sheer census numbers suggest. The town's two black churches draw a regular crowd, and the town recently hired a full-time affirmative action officer. Diversity programs are everywhere, and two guests who asked to take friends to the screening each took someone of a different race.
"Everyone gets along with everyone," said Jason Osborne, a senior at Greenwich High School whose father is the former head of the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter. 
That said, he allowed that there were remnants of a harsher time. This year, he said, a black security guard at his school broke up a fight between two white students. A friend of one of the students then called the guard a racial slur. "In my four years there," Mr. Osborne said, "that's the only time anything openly has happened."
Other audience members shared with one another instances that seemed lifted straight out of the movie, experiences in which life in suburban paradise had been less than perfect: mothers being mistaken for nannies and fathers for chauffeurs, and young drivers often getting a police "escort" to their door. 
"Do some of those things happen in Greenwich?" said Colleen Barnswell, a black civic leader who settled in Greenwich six years ago. "Yes. I have been mistaken for a housekeeper, and my husband has been stopped by the police. These things happen anywhere. The movie was not about Greenwich. It was about people trying to identify themselves and struggling with the definitions that others place on them."
The movie is clear about the keen pressure to assimilate, and the price the characters pay for submission.
The Spader children reflect opposite ends of the spectrum. "It was sort of interesting the way they showed the daughter embracing the white culture that she had grown up in and the son going back and wanting to go to an all-black college," said Rebecca Allen, a senior at Greenwich Academy who wanted to see the film in part because of her own mixed-race home. She will attend Williams College in the fall. 
Mr. Brown, the driver whose car was stopped after the screening, does not have major complaints about life in Greenwich. He installed his family here in 1955 and stayed put. But he conjured up the world that might have been. He said, "A lot of people are too young to remember that the United Nations was originally earmarked to be in Greenwich." He thinks it was just as much fear of difference that drove it away as anything that Manhattan had to offer.
Preston Foster, a black Greenwich high school teacher who said he grew up in the town's public housing, said he would have been content if Greenwich had simply created more housing for middle-income people. "There was an opportunity in Greenwich to create a middle class," Mr. Foster said. Now, he said, such homes are few and far between, even if the fences seem to be everywhere.

An article and a picture caption on Sunday about differing reactions among residents of Greenwich, Conn., who watched a preview of a Spike Lee film about racial profiling in the town gave an incorrect surname in some copies for an audience member, a Greenwich High School senior whose father formerly headed the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter. He is Jason Osborne, not Robinson.

HEADLINE: The Estate Next Door 

BYLINE:  By DEBRA WEST 

DATELINE: POCANTICO HILLS 

 BODY:
FOR several years now everyone in town has known that David Rockefeller planned to build a restaurant on 80 acres of the expansive Rockefeller family estate here. Though at first there was some grumbling about increased traffic, neighbors came to understand that the restaurant was necessary to finance a project more in keeping with Rockefeller tradition: an environmental education center.
 Then, in late December, the news broke that the restaurant was not all that would be built. Mr. Rockefeller, 87, the grandson of the oil magnate John D. Rockefeller, planned to sell 94 acres of his land to a housing developer to help pay for the restaurant and the environmental education center. 
 The proposed development caught Pocantico Hills residents, neighbors and even some of Mr. Rockefeller's own relatives by surprise. Now a group of concerned citizens is trying to prevent the sale of the property, hoping to persuade Mr. Rockefeller and the developer to call off their deal and let the land remain wild. 
 "I feel very responsible as a family member to listen to the community and to preserve open space," said Rachel P. Gumina, 42, a granddaughter of Nelson Rockefeller, who lives in Pocantico Hills and opposes the development. "Part of my family's heritage is to help preserve land here. Every acre you develop is one acre less for the children and the grandchildren."
 John D. Rockefeller began buying land in Pocantico Hills in the 1890's, creating a private estate that eventually encompassed more than 3,600 acres. The property runs largely uninterrupted through quiet forests, picturesque farmland and wide-open fields. It stretches from the Taconic Parkway to the banks of the Hudson River.
 "Pocantico Hills is a gorgeous place and it's not gorgeous by accident," the writer Ben Cheever said recently. "Pocantico is gorgeous because the Rockefeller family wanted it that way."
 Mr. Cheever, who lives in Pocantico Hills, helped to organize the opposition to the housing proposal after an article appeared on the front page of The New York Times about Mr. Rockefeller's plans. A community meeting on Jan. 24 drew close to 150 people, about half the population of the hamlet of Pocantico Hills. At the meeting, residents voiced concern not only about the housing proposal, but also about plans for a spa and hotel, which now appear to be postponed, its opponents said.
 "This land was not always open land; this beauty is not natural," Mr. Cheever told the standing-room only crowd that assembled in the Pocantico Hills firehouse for the Friday night meeting.
 The open land was restored by John D. Rockefeller, who bought and demolished farms and estates, rerouted railroad lines, relocated a college and stubbornly outlived reluctant property owners to amass one single landholding with seemingly endless vistas.
 "He wasnt just patient, he was extravagant," Mr. Cheever said. "He paid $700,000 in 1929 to buy the entire village of Eastview and then leveled its 42 houses. John D. Jr. continued the tradition and snapped up more land whenever it was available. He carried on the work his father had begun, making Pocantico look, as the old joke goes, the way the world would look if God had had money."
 About five years ago, David Rockefeller, the former president and chief executive officer of Chase Manhattan Bank, began planning to build a nonprofit organic farm and environmental education center on 80 acres of land that includes the family's stone barns. The Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, as the education center will be called, was intended to honor the memory of his late wife, Margaret, a co-founder of the American Farmland Trust, an organization that promotes farmland protection and environmentally sound farming. The center's goal is to promote environmentally and economically sustainable agriculture in the Hudson Valley.
 To finance the education aspect, Mr. Rockefeller decided to create an 80-seat organic restaurant to berun by the owners of the Blue Hill restaurant in Greenwich Village as well as a catering hall, a cafe that will sell homegrown produce and ome offices. The restaurant, to be called Blue Hill at Stone Barns, is expected to open in the fall.
 Originally the cost of the project was estimated at $10 million, said Peter Johnson, an associate of Mr. Rockefeller's and a trustee of the Stone Barns Restoration Corporation, the nonprofit corporation established to develop the project. Because the cost has ballooned to nearly $30 million, in part because the barns needed more extensive renovation than originally anticipated, Mr. Rockefeller decided to sell land on the northeast corner of the estate, to a housing developer, Michael Daly. Mr. Daly, the president of Forest City Daly Housing in New York, and a group of private investors hold an option to buy 94 acres abutting the Taconic State Parkway for $4.5 million.
 The property is zoned for one-acre development. But a representative of the developer, Patrick Fogarty, told community members in a meeting in late December that the plans include building only 30 houses, each between 8,000 and 9,000 square feet, to be sold for about $2 million a piece, said Pat Jones, a community organizer.
 Mr. Daly did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
 EVEN the Rockefellers, as it turns out, couldn't afford the expense of maintaining a 3,600-acre estate in taxheavy Westchester County. As early as the 1950's John D. Rockefeller Sr.'s heirs began discussing what do with the estate, said Mr. Johnson, who is a historian who has worked with the family for 27 years.
 Nelson Rockefeller, the former vice president and governor of New York, saw the property less as a private retreat than as a monument to his family's history. When he died in 1979, he left his one-third interest in the estate to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. As a result of that gift, Kykuit, the family home built by John D. Rockefeller Jr., is open to the public for tours.
 Then in 1983, the Rockefeller State Park was formed, with an initial gift of 750 acres from the family, and a promise of an additional 900 acres from John D. Rockefeller Sr.'s two surviving grandsons, David and Laurance S. Rockefeller.
 But even before the land was officially opened to the public, hikers, joggers and horse back riders were welcomed on the miles of carriage trails that wind through the estate.
 "One of the things the Rockefellers did was to actually encourage public use of the land," said John L. Hough, who lives on the Pleasantville side of the Rockefeller preserve and opposes the housing plan. "If they hadn't, if they had kept it all sealed off, there might not be such a fuss. Part of the legacy of John D. Rockefeller is that we all appreciate the open space that is here."
 Mr. Hough and the other members of the opposition group called Citizens Concerned About Pocantico Land Development fear that the housing deal represents a whittling away of the Rockefeller legacy.
 "Open space isn't lost all at once," said Mr. Hough, who works with the United Nations development programs. "It's lost one acre here and one acre there. Or, in this case, 100 acres here or there."
 But to call selling a 94-acre parcel of land an incremental undoing of the Rockefeller legacy is unfair and untrue, Mr. Johnson, David Rockefeller's associate, said. The history of the Rockefeller estate is very complex, he said.
 Neither David nor Laurance Rockefeller returned telephone calls seeking comment, but Mr. Johnson said that parcels of the estate have been soldoff before, some to the Hackley School in Tarrytown, some to the state to widen the Taconic Parkway, some to other family members to build homes.
 "In order to make something accessible to the public there are great costs," Mr. Johnson said. "The land with the stone barns was zoned residential. He had the right to develop it any way he wanted. He could have said, 'Hey, Im getting old, I want to sell that land and fund some great causes that I love.' He voluntarily sought a zoning change."
 The 80-acre Stone Barns parcel where the restaurant and education center will go is along Bedford Road, near the center of the preserve. It is zoned as an "open space resource district," which means commercial ventures can be operated upon it as long as the profits help finance open space. The land where the housing is planned has always been zoned for residential use.
 About 10 Rockefeller families live in Pocantico Hills, on land both inside and outside the private fenced estate, which includes Kykuit. At least three of them were at the meeting opposing development. The hamlet has only about 100 families in all and, at least until the restaurant opens on Bedford Road, no commercial development.
 ABOUT 20 miles from Midtown Manhattan, Pocantico Hills is a kind of company town, though the company that residents all seem to share an interest in is the Rockefeller family.
 The Rockefeller family has left its imprint on the hamlet's school, Pocantico Central School, said Peter M. Lisi, who is principal and superintendent of the kindergarten through eighth-grade school. John D. Rockefeller Jr., donated the land and paid for half of the construction of the original 1934 school building.
 "The family has certainly had a major impact on the quality of our life here," Mr. Lisi said.
 Classes use the Rockefeller Preserve as an extension of their schoolyard. Kindergartners and first graders study birds on the preserve; second graders raise pigs on David Rockefeller's Hudson Pines farm; fifth graders grow apples in the Rockefeller orchard and seventh graders study the life cycle of trout as they help restock the Pocantico River.
 The education center at the Stone Barns will only add to the school's curriculum and its relationship with the Rockefellers, Mr. Lisi said.
 "We've been able to have a pretty high level of input all along," he said. "They recently asked us to send them a plan for how often and when we would like to use the education center."
 On the other hand, Mr. Lisi worries that new housing built within the school district's boundaries could change the nature of his small school.
 "The size of a school matters," Mr. Lisi said. "We have 360 kids, an average of 17 kids per class. But if you add 30 or 50 homes that will change. A school with a staff of 50 is different from a school with a staff of 75. A school with eight buses is different from a school with 16 buses."
 At the community meeting, people expressed gratitude for all that the Rockefeller family has done for the region. They wondered why Mr. Rockefeller didn't turn to the community to ask for financial assistance, if the Stone Barns needed extra money. They said they could have helped find an environmental group to buy the land and maintain it as open space. More than 100 people signed a petition asking that the housing development be stopped and that a master plan be drawn up for all of the open land in Pocantico Hills. They intend to present the petitions at a Mount Pleasant Planning Board meeting on Feb. 6, at which the planning board is scheduled to discuss the realignment of lot lines in the 94-acre parcel slated for development.
 The developers have already hired Michael Klemens, a conservationist who works for the Wildlife Conservation Society (also known as the Bronx Zoo) to study the land that is slated for development, Mr. Johnson said. It is an action most developers would not take, said Mr. Johnson, and should signal to opponents that the development will be environmentally sensitive.
 Though 94 acres may seem small compared with the land that the Rockefellers have donated for public use, community organizers say that trying to stop this housing development in a development-crazed county is not nimby-ism. "This land is public, or has been treated as public for decades," Mr. Cheever said. "It isn't our backyard. It is Westchester's backyard, New York State's backyard. It is America's backyard."
 It is also, of course, the Rockefeller's backyard.

HEADLINE: Departing Security Official Issues Warning 

BYLINE:  By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
Richard A. Clarke, the blunt, sometimes abrasive White House adviser who raised the alarm about unconventional national security threats ranging from failed states to biological and computer terrorism for more than a decade, quietly resigned as President Bush's special adviser for cyberspace security on Friday.
 In an interview after his last day in office, Mr. Clarke warned that although the government had made considerable progress in defending its electronic infrastructure from computer attacks, the United States faced ever greater peril, given its growing dependence on the Internet. 
 "A sophisticated cyberattack may not result in massive deaths," he said. "But it could really hurt our economy and diminish our ability to respond to a crisis, especially if it is combined with a war, or a terrorist attack." 
Mr. Clarke said the attack last weekend by a computer bug known as the Sapphire worm showed the vulnerability of the United States' increasingly Internet-based economy. Though it was a relatively simple bug, he said, Sapphire, which has also been called Slammer, ravaged systems throughout the United States and overseas in just a few hours, shutting down some of the Bank of America's automated teller machines and Continental Airlines' online ticketing system, and denying access to the Internet to millions of personal computer owners.
"Don't assume that the damage done by hackers in the past is predictive of the future," Mr. Clarke said. "As Sept. 11 showed, as long as our vulnerabilities are large, some enemy will exploit them in a new and hugely damaging way." 
Before tackling the country's computer vulnerabilities, Mr. Clarke was in charge of the White House's counterterrorism office for President Bush and President Bill Clinton. He sometimes antagonized officials in federal agencies and even some White House colleagues by demanding more aggressive action against Islamic extremists like Osama bin Laden. Mr. Clarke, associates said, was an ardent proponent of military action not only against Mr. bin Laden, but also against the Taliban government of Afghanistan, which provided a home for him and his terrorist network, Al Qaeda.
After the Sept. 11 attacks, colleagues said, he played a critical role in the White House situation room, helping to ground the nation's airliners and to increase security at other vulnerable targets.
Mr. Clarke said the nation is safer today than before Sept. 11 because Al Qaeda's sanctuary in Afghanistan is gone and because Americans had rounded up hundreds of Qaeda operatives abroad and tightened aviation security overseas and domestically. 
"But we still don't have control of our borders, or sufficient control of terrorist money transfers," he said. "And we still don't know where all the potential sleeper cells are in the U.S."
At the same time, he said, he feared that civil rights might be eroding in the struggle against terrorism. "When we sacrifice our civil liberties and privacy rights, the terrorists win because they have gotten us to change the nature of our country," he said.
Despite having fought terrorism for more than 11 years, he said, "I have never seen one reason to infringe on privacy or civil liberties." 
Mr. Clarke said he was leaving his post now because "11 years in the White House and a total of 30 in government is more than enough," and because President Bush would soon unveil a new national strategy to protect the nation's information infrastructure, which Mr. Clarke and his team had drafted.
Associates said Mr. Clarke was becoming increasingly weary of battling a federal bureaucracy that was resistant to considering new issues like cyberterrorism as real threats.
Mr. Clarke dismissed reports that his bureaucratic opponents had blocked him from being offered a senior post in the new Department of Homeland Security. 
In a recent book, Anthony Lake, a national security adviser to President Clinton, called Mr. Clarke "a bulldog of a bureaucrat" and noted that his "bluntness toward those at his level" had not earned him "universal affection."
In response, Mr. Clarke said: "This was not a popularity contest. When you are working on life-and-death issues, you sometimes have to bring out the bulldozer."

HEADLINE: E-Commerce Report; 
Some Web merchants fill a void, and make a profit, by selling coffins and other funeral supplies online.

BYLINE:  By Bob Tedeschi 

 BODY:
WITH so many consumer purchases proving popular online -- whether books, concert tickets or prescription drugs -- the question was eventually bound to arise. Why not coffins? 
 Funeral industry executives and analysts say that consumers are increasingly interested in being able to shop online for their funeral needs and that some Web merchants are stepping up to serve them. 
 "When you visit casket dealers online, you can look at something over and over again," said Jay Kravetz, editor of Death Care Business, a trade publication. "You're not pressured -- you have time to look with relatives and friends. It's really easier online." 
And it can be cheaper, given that some funeral directors mark up their coffins as much as 300 percent over wholesale, knowing that most consumers are reluctant to haggle or shop around. 
On the Web, Funeral Depot, which sells funeral supplies both online and offline from its Hallandale Beach, Fla., store, is able to earn a profit of about 40 percent by charging double the wholesale price of its coffins -- and still significantly beating funeral homes' prices. The average price of Funeral Depot coffins sold online is about $1,500. 
"I'll offer the same coffin at a fraction of what a funeral home charges, deliver it overnight for free, and still make substantial profit and walk away the hero," said Dean Magliocca, president and owner of Funeral Depot. 
Mr. Magliocca is among the more successful online merchants of funeral supplies, with projected revenue this year of $1.5 million -- the bulk of it from his Web operation. It is a modest number, to be sure, but Mr. Magliocca is not complaining. "We're very pleased with our progress," he said. "It's taken us a little over three and a half years to get us where we're at, but we've finally perfected what we do, and we're starting to generate a lot of revenue with nice margins." 
At the time he started the Web operation, Mr. Magliocca had been selling only monuments and grave markers from his storefront. "I started to hear from families that they didn't have enough money to spend on markers because the coffins were $5,000," he recalled. "I found out it wasn't necessarily because of the wholesale costs." 
Mr. Magliocca, who started the online business "with about $400 worth of Web publishing software and a lot of elbow grease," offers nearly 300 different coffins, with prices ranging from $745 for an unsealed thin-metal box to $18,500 for a solid-bronze model that he says "looks like it belongs in space, not the ground." 
FuneralDepot.com also sells "theme" coffins made by White Light Inc., which are painted in various motifs, including an auto racing theme. For the whimsical there is a coffin done up like a special-delivery package and stamped "Return to Sender."
Mr. Magliocca sells coffins from all leading manufacturers, like Hillenbrand Industries' Batesville Casket Company and Matthews International's York Group. But he has to buy them from third parties because he says that none of the major manufacturers will sell their coffins directly to him, or to any online coffin merchant, for that matter. 
The problem, which has plagued manufacturers and online retailers in many industries, is referred to in business parlance as channel conflict. Manufacturers or their distributors either do not trust Net sellers to protect the image of their brands, or they do not want to upset their established resellers -- in this case, funeral homes -- by allowing online retailers to sell their wares at a discount. 
To work around this problem, Mr. Magliocca has set up a nationwide network of about 45 independent funeral homes that are authorized to sell coffins from well-known manufacturers and have agreed to ship orders on Funeral Depot's behalf. These funeral homes earn a small percentage of each of these sales -- business they would not have otherwise gotten -- and many have received referrals from FuneralDepot.com customers who call or send e-mail messages to ask the company to suggest funeral homes in various cities. 
Funeral Depot's arrangement with the independents has drawn legal fire from at least one manufacturer, Batesville, which says it has a lawsuit pending against Funeral Depot. While Batesville would not comment on the suit, a Funeral Depot lawyer said the case focused on whether the company could legally continue to use the Batesville name when offering Batesville coffins on FuneralDepot.com or link to images from the Batesville catalog that are shown on other Web sites.
Other online coffin sellers are coming up with their own work-arounds to secure brand-name merchandise. Kim Powers, president and founder of Memorial Concepts Online, which sells coffins and other funeral-related items on the Web, declined to say exactly where her company bought its coffins. 
Ms. Powers, whose three-year-old company is based in Ponca City, Okla., said Memorial Concepts was now profitable, despite the fact that she could not sell in her home state. In Oklahoma, as in nearly a dozen other states, the law prohibits anyone without a funeral director's license from selling a coffin -- critics say the policy is meant to protect the interests of funeral homes. 
Last year, Ms. Powers sued the state, arguing that the law violates, among other things, her right to economic liberty under the United States Constitution's "Privileges or Immunities" clause. 
In December, a Federal District Court in Oklahoma ruled against Ms. Powers, observing the longstanding practice of federal courts to defer to the judgment of state legislatures when the lawmakers regulate "nonfundamental rights," like those involving working conditions or the right to earn a living (as opposed to "fundamental rights," like the right to privacy). Ms. Powers and the organization that is representing her, the Institute for Justice, a libertarian advocacy group in Washington, are appealing the case to the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver. 
A similar case brought by the Institute for Justice on behalf of a non-Internet coffin seller in Tennessee could help Ms. Powers's cause. In that case, in which the plaintiff is challenging a law that is nearly identical to Oklahoma's, a Federal District Court struck down the Tennessee regulation, saying it served "no legitimate governmental purpose." Tennessee's attorney general has yet to decide whether to appeal to the United States Supreme Court.
Even though the Oklahoma law prevents Ms. Powers from selling coffins in the state and has cost the company time and money, she said the publicity had been helpful. "Our business has always been very good in other areas, like markers and monuments," she said. "But since we brought this case, our coffin business has more than quadrupled." 
While buying coffins online may be a way for consumers to save money, it may not necessarily be the best thing for the newly bereaved, according to Robert M. Fells, general counsel of the National Funeral Directors Association. 
Mr. Fells, who said his group was "just fine" with allowing independent coffin sellers to operate online, said grief counseling experts advised people to visit funeral homes in person to help select coffins or urns as a way to ease the grieving process. 
Yet, he said, "more and more, instead of going to the funeral home, people are saying, 'I don't need that -- I'll e-mail you.' "

HEADLINE: S.U.V. and Pickup Sales Are Likely to Grow 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Sport utility vehicles and pickups will maintain their growth in the American market as competition from Asia intensifies, auto executives said over the weekend as they gathered here for an annual conference with car dealers.
 Industry executives also defended their largest vehicles against a tide of recent questions raised by federal regulators and environmental advocates. 
 Controversy has not deterred competition in the lucrative market. The latest salvo came on Friday, when the chief of the Hyundai Motor Company, the Korean conglomerate that has made its name mostly in low-priced cars, said the company would probably enter the full-size sport utility market by 2007. Hyundai is also considering building its first pickup around the same time, as well as a new minivan, and is evaluating whether to start a luxury brand. 
"We are developing a full-size S.U.V. We think the market will continue to grow," the chief of Hyundai, D. J. Kim, said before the National Automobile Dealers Association meeting started on Saturday.
The new products would be part of Hyundai's goal of tripling American sales, to one million vehicles, by 2010.
While the Big Three dominated sport utility sales in the 1990's, Asian automakers, particularly Toyota, have lineups that today look more like the domestics. The next battleground appears to be the pickup. Last month, Nissan unveiled its first full-size pickup, the Titan, at the Detroit auto show, joining Toyota in a battle with Detroit automakers for one of its most lucrative markets.
"It should be clear that the truck segments are now coming under attack," Wolfgang Bernhard, the chief operating officer of the Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, said in a speech. "Anyone who believes pickups won't represent the next big product offensive of the imports is wrong," he added.
Top executives of General Motors and the Ford Motor Company defended the S.U.V., a cornerstone of their profitability, from recent campaigns against its effects on the nation's oil consumption by a range of groups, from religious leaders to the columnist Arianna Huffington. Automakers and car dealers said they saw no move away from such vehicles by consumers.
"S.U.V.'s are under a lot of scrutiny these days, and yet the S.U.V. buyer is a very loyal lot," said William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Ford. "We think the attacks are unfair, but we can't change that."
But Mr. Ford, in speeches on Friday and Saturday, said environmental responsibility, a low priority in most buyer surveys, would become an important measuring stick.
"Many are becoming impatient," he said, "with the social and environmental tradeoffs that have become associated with the automobile."
The S.U.V. has also been bruised of late on safety. G. Richard Wagoner Jr., chief of General Motors, took issue with recent comments by the Bush administration's top auto safety regulator, Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
In a speech last month, Dr. Runge, a former emergency room doctor, said he would not put one of his children in a sport utility that did not perform well on rollover tests.
"I didn't understand his choice of a vehicle for his teenage kids because I go exactly the opposite way," Mr. Wagoner said. 
The traffic safety agency is toughening its rollover testing, making it reflective more real-world driving conditions. The agency is also considering new tests and regulations aimed at making S.U.V.'s and pickups less dangerous when they collide with smaller vehicles.
On the economic front, Mr. Wagoner was upbeat, saying he expected an added 1.8 million vehicles in industrywide sales in the United States by the end of the decade. Last year, 16.8 million vehicles were sold.
"A new American auto boom is ours to loose," Mr. Wagoner told auto dealers. "Let's not screw it up."

HEADLINE: As Broadband Gains, The Internet's Snails, Like AOL, Fall Back 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
America Online now has some company in the Internet doghouse. Last week, the company said the number of subscribers to its flagship Internet service, by far the nation's largest, had fallen in the fourth quarter, the first decline in its history, further contributing to the woes of its parent, AOL Time Warner.
 But executives at the America Online division can at least find solace that its plight is shared by the other leading dial-up Internet access providers, EarthLink and Microsoft's MSN, which also have shrinking numbers of dial-up subscribers. 
 The problem is speed. Consumers have been dropping their slow dial-up services and switching to faster service, called broadband. AOL and the other dial-up leaders do offer broadband service, but the latest quarterly results show that consumers are shunning these offers, despite increased promotion. Rather, they are buying broadband services offered by cable and telephone companies. 
"People still look to the telcos and the cable guys first for broadband service," said Jed Kolko, who is an analyst with Forrester Research.
Final results are not in from every company, but it appears that broadband subscriptions in the United States increased to about 16 million at year's end from 10 million a year earlier, out of about 60 million total households online. The broadband offering by the three big dial-up players totals no more than 2 million subscribers.
A recent study by Nielsen/NetRating found that the number of people who connect to the Internet at home over dial-up connections had actually started to decline as broadband users increased by 59 percent over the last year. 
"We were surprised by the rapid acceleration of broadband adoption in the home," said Bob Visse, the director of marketing for MSN at Microsoft. 
At year's end, America Online, had 26.5 million subscribers, a loss of 176,000 from the previous quarter. For last year, it added only 1.2 million subscribers, far less than the 3.7 million it added in 2001. 
AOL said its marketing campaigns were less effective in the fourth quarter than it expected. As a result, the number of dial-up customers paying the full $23.90 monthly price increased only slightly.
But AOL reduced the number of customers that are offered free or discounted service as an attempt to keep them from canceling altogether.
At year's end, AOL had about 650,000 broadband subscribers, up only a handful in the fourth quarter, despite a new television campaign and heavy promotion on its own service.
Even more surprising, Microsoft, which thought it would capitalize on AOL's problems with a fancy new product and a $300 million multimedia blitzkrieg for its butterfly mascot, saw no growth in the quarter; it has nine million subscribers for its various MSN Internet services.
Microsoft said the total included a decrease in use for its narrowband Internet service and MSNTV service, formerly WebTV, offset by increases in its broadband service and its Hotmail extra-storage service (which offers a larger e-mail box). John G. Connors, the company's chief financial officer, told investors last month that the company would not meet its earlier goal for subscriber growth in the first half of this year.
EarthLink, the third-biggest Internet service provider, kept its subscriber count flat in the final quarter of last year, at 4.8 million. But that masked a reduction of 70,000 dial-up subscribers, offset by acquisitions that added 130,000 subscribers and the addition of 98,000 broadband subscribers. If it were not for acquisitions, EarthLink's dial-up subscriber count would have declined by 8 percent last year, Goldman, Sachs estimates.
"This is no surprise for us," said Charles G. Betty, EarthLink's chief executive. "We saw the narrowband market peak two years ago." Mr. Betty estimates that four million households got dial-up Internet access for the first time last year and that fewer than three million newcomers will enter the market this year.
He said that EarthLink was betting the market would split and that many customers would move to broadband service and many more would gravitate to lower-cost dial-up services. EarthLink has bought PeoplePC to compete with United Online's growing $9.95-a-month dial-up services.
America Online is still by far the leader in one important measure: profits. Last year it had Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $1.8 billion on sales of $9.1 billion. That is down from Ebitda of $2.3 billion in 2001, and this year the measure will decline again, analysts estimate. 
Still, EarthLink and MSN have never made a profit, although they both intend to soon. United Online, posted its first profit, of $1.5 million, in the third quarter. And even SBC Communications, the phone company with the most broadband subscriptions, is still losing money on them. (The cable companies do not report publicly on their broadband profitability.)
The other full-price dial-up services are also losing ground. SBC's dial-up service, mainly the venerable Prodigy service it had acquired, has fewer than half of the customers it did a year ago. And even a venture with Yahoo to add features to SBC's dial-up offering could not prevent the service from losing 150,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter alone. AT&T will no longer discuss how many subscribers it has for Worldnet, its dial-up Internet service provider, which had 1.4 million subscribers a year ago, according to ISP-Planet, a Web site.
The major telephone companies are all expanding their broadband subscriptions for what is called D.S.L. or digital subscriber line, service at an annual pace of more than a 50 percent. In the last quarter of 2002, SBC Communications added 245,000 subscribers, Verizon Communications added 148,000, and BellSouth added 97,000. 
The cable companies have been growing slightly slower because they have a greater share of the market, but most have yet to report their fourth-quarter results. 
Last week, AOL Time Warner said that Road Runner, the high-speed service of its cable systems, added 291,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter, more than any broadband service to report results so far. That leaves Time Warner cable with 2.6 million broadband data subscribers, or 24 percent of its total customers.
AOL, by contrast, sells broadband service to only 2.5 percent of its users.
"AOL, the world's largest Internet service provider, only has 650,000 subscribers, while Road Runner has 2.6 million -- go figure," said Michael W. Harris, the president of Kinetic Strategies, a consulting firm in Phoenix. AOL's strategy of charging $10 a month more for America Online's broadband service than for Road Runner does not appear to be working, he said. 
"Most people who are coming to broadband want the most speed at the lowest cost," he said, "and they are getting that from their cable companies."
In a conference call with investors last week, Richard D. Parsons, the chief executive of AOL Time Warner, said the company would redouble its effort to justify the price premium of the AOL broadband offering.
"While a number of people are getting AOL over broadband now, the product isn't really differentiated in a way that we would like," he said, noting that the company would soon introduce a new service with more features. "I don't think you are going to be able to look for clear indications of how the new broadband initiative is being taken up by consumers until midyear, because before you start throwing lots of marketing dollars after it, we want to put the product together -- we want to do some test marketing."
Microsoft, too, is looking to refashion its MSN service as a premium add-on for customers with broadband service from local companies. It spent $500 million to develop new features for MSN 8.0, like a software system to detect junk e-mail messages. But the advertising campaign to promote it did not stem a decline in customers for its dial-up service.
Microsoft said it was hobbled by a large number of defections among customers who had signed long-term contracts a few years ago in return for rebates of as much as $400. 
"Those customers are very price-sensitive, and they have been going to whatever offer is most attractive," said Mr. Visse, the marketing director.
Mr. Kolko, of Forrester Research, said that for all of Microsoft's advertising, it had not been able to establish itself in the fastest-growing part of the market.
"The butterfly doesn't tell people anything specifically about the broadband service," he said. 
As of the end of the third quarter, Microsoft had 500,000 broadband subscribers as part of a joint venture with Qwest Communications International. It also has a small number of additional subscribers through arrangements where it buys and resells D.S.L. lines from other phone companies. But Mr. Visse said these arrangements were not profitable and so it had not marketed them.
"We've decided that we will only grow this business if we can grow it profitably," Mr. Visse said. 
Mr. Betty, of EarthLink, however, questions how big the market will be for the add-on services that Microsoft and AOL are planning, given that they add $10 or $15 a month to the already high broadband bills.
"I'm not convinced that the market for a premium service is anything other than a very small market," he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 5, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article and a chart in Business Day on Monday about a decline in the number of dial-up subscribers to Internet services misstated the percentage change for two services from 2001 to 2002. The combined total of dial-up and high-speed subscribers for Earthlink rose by 3 percent, to 4.8 million; it was not unchanged. The number of dial-up customers for SBC-Prodigy declined by 22 percent, to 1.4 million, not by 61 percent.

HEADLINE: Shuttle's Effect On Economy May Be Small, Analysts Say 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The destruction of the space shuttle Columbia, which filled the airways and newspapers all weekend, adds to the list of bad news investors have absorbed recently, including the threat of a war with Iraq, a nuclear standoff with North Korea, declining consumer confidence and slowing corporate earnings growth.
 But unlike the other events, it does not appear that the shuttle tragedy should have a significant impact on consumer confidence or on financial markets, several analysts said yesterday. One reason is that the destruction of the shuttle has not been linked to anything, like terrorism, that would point to increased risk in the future. 
 Even before the latest round of bad news, several strategists and economists argued that investors should effectively ignore the possibility of a war with Iraq in their investment decisions, although they agreed that the war threat has been a drag on the economy and the stock market. 
Instead, they said, investors should concentrate on the economy and if they thought a rebound was likely this year, then it was a good time to buy stocks. Some analysts even said that the start of a war with Iraq would give the stock market a lift, as the fighting could end the uncertainty of what will happen and when.
"The only way this has an effect, to my view, is if it is tied into terrorism," James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, said yesterday, speaking of the shuttle's breakup as it re-entered the atmosphere on Saturday morning.
Douglas R. Cliggott, president of B& P Research, said, "It is clearly a huge personal tragedy for the seven families involved, but in terms of trying to map it into confidence and spending, I don't think it is going to register very high."
That does not mean that stocks of companies involved in the shuttle program will not fall as investors worry about what caused the breakup of the shuttle. But, analysts said, it will probably take a more direct link to a faulty part for a company's stock to face major selling. 
Boeing and Lockheed Martin, through an equal equity stake in United Space Alliance, are the main contractors for the shuttle program. There are more than 120 subcontractors, including Honeywell and Alliant Techsystems.
As for the overall stock market, it is already under pressure from the other bad news. The economy all but ground to a halt in the fourth quarter, when the gross domestic product inched up just 0.7 percent. Consumer confidence fell in January and is not far above the nine-year low it hit in October. And after a nice rally in the first trading days of the year that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up 6 percent, all three main market gauges are now down for the year, with the Dow off 3.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite index is down 1.1 percent.
"What is going to continue to weigh on the market is the poor fundamentals," said Jeffrey Applegate, an independent market strategist.
In January 1986, when the shuttle Challenger exploded on takeoff, the stock market was in the midst of a long rally that ended only with the 1987 crash. On the day of the Challenger explosion, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.2 percent while some stocks of companies linked to the shuttle program, including Morton Thiokol, which was the contractor that made the booster for the shuttle, fell sharply.
The analysts who say a war with Iraq should not diminish investors' focus on the stock market are not advising a headlong rush into equities. But they say stocks will be attractive if the economy revs up to a 3 percent pace in the first half of the year and a little higher in the second half.
Nor do analysts seem to favor so-called war plays, in part because they have been bought and sold already. Military and aerospace stocks are down 26 percent from the end of June, based on the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Defense Index, and did not get a significant lift last week after reports that President Bush would ask for a one-third increase in his military budget over the next six years.
"What investors should keep their eyes on is whether the economy gets traction," said Mr. Paulsen, of Wells Capital Management. "It's the economy that will determine the performance of the stock market this year. The war won't be there at the end of the year. The war will fade." His firm is recommending an asset allocation of 75 percent in stocks.
He predicts that the economy is going to grow steadily because it now getting a push from lower interest rates, increased government spending and a weaker dollar, which helps American exporters.
Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig, said, "If you have a long-term outlook, you are supposed to wager that the world works out O.K." But in the current environment, he said, "there is no appetite for risk and there is a ghoulish fascination with the myriad of things that could go wrong."
The current aversion to risk combined with taking a long-term view, he said, makes "this is a good time to buy stocks." He said he was "much more aggressive" in his investments right now.
Besides playing down the threat of a war on investor decisions, analysts argue that there are not many other alternatives this year, outside stocks, that offer a chance of acceptable returns.
Interest rates are so low that money market funds barely pay 1 percent. Bond market rates are higher, but if the economy does pick up speed and Congress and the White House can approve plans to stimulate the economy, interest rates will move higher, cutting into the returns from bonds as their prices fall.
Other havens, like gold, which hit a six-year high of $370 an ounce on Jan. 28, could fall once the uncertainty about the war with Iraq passed. That decline would pull down the price of gold company stocks, which as a group have jumped 25 percent since December.
While a threat of war should not divert investors from stocks, analysts still said that investors have to be prepared for all eventualities. "Investors more than ever should expect the unexpected," said Frederick B. Taylor, chief investment officer at the United States Trust Company.
This means that investors need to be more diversified than usual and more careful in their selections of stocks, he said. "I want companies," Mr. Taylor said, "where managements are able to adjust to uncertainties in uncertain times."
Mr. Cliggott, of B& P Research, put it this way: "An investor should still be extremely cautious. But not so much because of the uncertainty of the military and political situations. But because we have many months ahead of us of disappointing economic growth and disappointing earnings growth."

HEADLINE: U.S. Opposes Proposal to Limit Who May Give Legal Advice 

BYLINE:  By ADAM LIPTAK 

 BODY:
A proposal by the American Bar Association that would prohibit anyone but lawyers from giving advice about the law is drawing opposition from the federal government, which says it is intended to stifle competition and could subject real estate agents, income tax preparers, credit counselors and other laypeople to civil and criminal penalties. 
 The proposal, which will be discussed this week at the association's meeting in Seattle, would also prohibit nonlawyers from negotiating on behalf of others and "selecting, drafting or completing legal documents." The association will vote on the proposal in August. 
 The bar association's president, Alfred P. Carlton Jr., said that the proposal was intended to provide a simple and clear definition of what constitutes the practice of law. Mr. Carlton also said that it would encourage nonlawyers to provide services they now hesitate to offer, for fear of stepping over the line that now separates the practice of law and other businesses. 
"There is a chilling effect on those industries," he said, "because there is not, in most jurisdictions, a well-understood or bright-line definition of what is and is not the practice of law."
But the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice are concerned about the scope of the proposal and submitted objections in a letter to the bar association in December. In whatever states adopted it, the agencies said, the rule could subject tenants' associations, claims adjusters, tax preparers, real estate agents, investment bankers, business planners, hospitals, labor unions andothers to penalties.
In an interview, Thomas M. Gordon, a lawyer with Halt, a legal consumer advocacy group in Washington, gave an example of the definition's scope. "Dear Abby would be subject to prosecution every time she answered a reader's letter that dealt with a legal issue," Mr. Gordon said.
The bar association's own antitrust law section opposes the definition. Robert T. Joseph, the section's chairman, said the proposal would prevent credit counselors from helping consumers negotiate payment plans with their creditors or laypeople from helping immigrants fill out Immigration and Naturalization Service forms.
Mr. Joseph said the association should instead encourage open competition, by explaining to the public why lawyers provide superior services at reasonable prices.
Jerry Ellig, the deputy director of the office of policy planning for the trade commission, explained why the government made its unusual submission.
"We don't think it's good public policy to constrain competition in the absence of really strong evidence that the constraint has an offsetting benefit," Mr. Ellig said. "We haven't seen evidence of how consumers are more protected if an attorney is present."
Dudley Humphrey, a North Carolina lawyer who is a member of the bar association task force that drafted the proposal, said the government was making a power grab.
"Quite frankly," Mr. Humphrey said, "it proceeds from the F.T.C.'s desire to assert what jurisdiction it has over the legal profession."
Monte Davis, the president of the Claims Group in Austin, Tex., said his company was the subject of an investigation by Texas officials for practicing law without a license.
His company assists people making claims in class-action settlements involving defective hardboard siding. Under the bar association proposal, his group's nonlawyers would be barred from doing that. 
"It really scared the pants off of us," Mr. Davis said of the investigation.
The Texas investigation was eventually dropped after Mr. Davis filed a lawsuit over it, but he remains perplexed and wary. If companies like his did not assist consumers, he said, the class-action money would go unclaimed.
His lawyer, Peter Kennedy, said the local bar had no interest in competing for the work. "They didn't teach me how to identify Masonite siding in law school," Mr. Kennedy said, adding that he "didn't go to law school to go out in the Texas heat to look at siding."
The bar's central concern, though, is with real estate closings. State laws differ sharply on who may conduct them. About 10 states, mostly in the East, require that lawyers be present.
James R. Maher, the executive vice president of the American Land Title Association, said that more than 80 percent of real estate closings were conducted by lay specialists. "Attorneys are great if you need them," Mr. Maher said, "but the state should not provide monopoly protection in the guise of consumer protection."
Mr. Humphrey said the organized bar would not easily give up this fight.
"Real estate work has been the bread-and-butter work of lawyers," he said. "It's the thing that keeps the doors open and the lights turned on. Certain elements in the real estate community, to speak quite frankly, are increasingly pressing to drive down prices."
Part of the problem, experts on each side of the bar association proposal said, is the difficulty of defining what amounts to legal work.
Geoffrey C. Hazard Jr., who teaches legal ethics at the University of Pennsylvania, said the enterprise was a difficult one.
"There isn't too much trouble in defining law practice for lawyers appearing in courtrooms and before administrative agencies," Professor Hazard said. "The difficulty is that most of what lawyers do is office practice, and what they do in office practice is often about the same thing as lots of nonlawyer officials in companies and governments do."
He said the bar association "is going to have a lot of difficulty with a definition that is intelligent and meaningful but not overly broad."
"I just don't see how that can be done very well," he said.
The proposed definition is widely considered to be expansive when compared to the existing prohibitions on the unauthorized practice of law in almost every state.
"It's breathtakingly broad," said Steven Lubet, who teaches legal ethics at Northwestern University. "It doesn't include what most states call the ancillary professions exception."
The problem with the bar association proposal, Professor Lubet continued, is not only economic. "It really reflects the worst of the profession, which is to assume that lawyers own the law and legal discourse," he said. "It's antidemocratic. In a democracy, everyone has an interest in discussing the law. The content of the law, rights and remedies, is meant to be part of the public discourse."

HEADLINE: The Best of America 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Astronauts speeding in from outer space, 40 miles above the earth, 16 minutes from touchdown . . . 
 We don't pay much attention to our astronauts until calamity strikes. And yet the grief that accompanies the spectacular loss of these brave strangers, men and women with unfamiliar names like David M. Brown and Laurel Clark, is extraordinary. 
 The posthumous television images of the smiling, healthy, enthusiastic crew of the space shuttle Columbia touch feelings that are usually reserved for those much closer to us. They're very difficult to watch. 
For Americans, in some sense, it's like watching the loss of our better selves. The astronauts may not get a tremendous amount of attention under ordinary circumstances, but they are the last unspoiled American heroes. They have not been laid low by scandal, or exposed as phonies. They carry none of the taint of bad faith that clings so stubbornly to so many in politics, the world of business and the media. Their motives, as far as we can tell, are still pure. They have come to embody whatever remains of the American ideal.
Dr. Clark, a Navy flight surgeon, had been conducting life-science experiments aboard the Columbia. The experiments were part of a wide range of studies by the crew that were aimed at improving the health and safety of humans on Earth and in space.
At a time when much of the world is gripped by the oppressive fear of war and terror, the crew of the Columbia was devoting its considerable talent to work that was creative, cooperative and constructive. Theirs was a mission of peace.
Gen. Omar Bradley, a hero of World War II, delivered a speech in Boston in 1948 that is remarkably appropriate for the violent and chaotic world of 2003. "The world has achieved brilliance without wisdom," he said, "power without conscience. Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical midgets. We know more about war than we know of peace, more about killing than we know about living."
Americans in 2003 are not just struggling with forces that are wildly uncertain and dangerous. We're also struggling, on a variety of fronts, with doubts about the direction and the soundness of our national mission. There is a uniform commitment to fighting terror, but public support for an invasion of Iraq varies considerably from week to week. Bitter arguments are raging over civil rights, civil liberties and immigration policies. And there is nothing close to a consensus on the fairness of the nation's tax policies and social welfare programs.
Mixed with the anxiety over war and terror and the threat posed by a weak domestic economy is an underlying feeling that this great and powerful nation could -- as Jack Kennedy contended -- do better, that its ideals are still important and that you court real danger if you continue giving them short shrift.
When our attention is drawn to the astronauts, even in the midst of tragedy, we are pleased to see them as powerful symbols of the most admirable aspects of American life. They are not superhumans. Saturday showed that they're fragile like the rest of us. But they hold in trust for us the spirit of adventure and exploration and decency and accomplishment that is so important to our view of ourselves as Americans.
No one wants to look in the mirror and see something low or mean. The astronauts help save us from that.
President Bush praised the crew of the Columbia for its "service to all humanity." He said, "These astronauts knew the dangers and they faced them willingly, knowing they had a high and noble purpose in life."
That was not hyperbole, but the simple truth.
Some time will go by and the press of world events will cause the astronauts and all they represent to slip again from our consciousness, which is too bad. It would be so much better if this terrible tragedy could somehow prompt a renewed commitment to America's "high and noble" ideals and aspirations. One quick example: The nation's great wealth and good fortune could be used to build a sparkling new generation of schools to educate the millions upon millions of young people whose talents and energy will have to be called upon if the U.S. is to continue to flourish.
That is one way in which we could honor the astronauts whose lives -- and tragic deaths -- remind us of our own deeply held aspirations, our ideals, those aspects of ourselves that we admire most.

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: THE CHALLENGER; 
Lessons From Uneven Challenger Investigation Help Create Attitude Change

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The space agency's description tonight of a cascade of warning signals from the computers aboard the shuttle Columbia in the seven minutes before it disintegrated was striking for more than just the picture it painted of the last, fiery seconds of a doomed craft.
 It was exactly the kind of information that NASA withheld for more than two weeks after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger 17 years ago. And for months, the investigation into the causes of that disaster was a cat-and-mouse game that pitted the space agency against dissident engineers who began leaking information about a long history of design failures that were hushed up in the interest of keeping the space program's financing alive. 
 It is too early to tell how the Columbia investigation will turn out. NASA will certainly face months of scrutiny about what it knew about the weaknesses of the insulating tiles that protect the orbiter as it re-enters the atmosphere and the structural vulnerabilities of the shuttle fleet's oldest craft. 
But in the hours after the Columbia disaster on Saturday, according to Bush administration officials and experts familiar with changes in the space agency over the last few years, there was a recognition that NASA could not afford another cover-up, another scramble to hide ominous signals of impending disaster.
"There is a big attitude change," said Donald J. Kutyna, a retired four-star general in the Air Force who was a member of the commission that investigated the Challenger. Referring to the administrator of NASA,he said, "Sean O'Keefe has seen the damage the agency did to itself when it covered up what happened."
The change seemed apparent tonight as Ron D. Dittemore, the space shuttle program manager, led reporters through a chronology of events, compiled from the early trove of data transmitted from sensors aboard the Columbia, of a flight that began to go awry as it entered the airspace over California. 
As in the Challenger disaster, the warning signs are evident only in retrospect. As in that disaster, the crew apparently had no warning that the readings they were seeing were evidence of a far greater problem.
But it was not until the night of Feb. 14, 1986 -- 17 days after the Challenger disaster -- that NASA released a chronology of the rapid-fire events that had spun out of control. And back then, they did so after evidence was leaking out that agency officials knew there was tremendous danger in launching the Challenger in the frigid cold, and that a series of previous shuttle launchings had nearly ended in disaster.
Today, NASA described at length what it knew about troubles with its protective tiles, and what programs it had put in place to find and solve the problem. And officials vowed today to hold two news briefings a day to maintain the flow of information.
The tiles will undoubtedly be a major subject of investigation, along with the General Accounting Office's conclusion, in a report issued last week, that NASA has put "little emphasis on end results, product performance and cost control" when dealing with its contractors, who consume $12.7 billion a year, or 90 percent of the agency's budget.
In some ways, the Columbia investigation may prove more difficult than unraveling the mystery of Challenger.
Because the Challenger explosion took place 73 seconds after liftoff, there were telltale photographs that showed how the flight began to go awry less than a half-second after the engines ignited. Those photographs of mysterious puffs of smoke could be correlated to the sensor data and, eventually, to large chunks of the shuttle that were recovered from the ocean.
But the pictures of the Columbia are taken from a distance of 40 miles. Much more will have to be pieced together from the data received from sensors, some of which went dead. Others showed a significant increase in the temperature in the left wheel well. But Mr. Dittemore would draw no public conclusion tonight, saying, "I'm thinking the same thing you are thinking, but I can't go beyond that."
But the fact that he was thinking out loud is itself a change.
In the Apollo 1 disaster, the details of NASA's mistakes, which contributed to a flash fire in a cockpit that killed three heroes of the early space program, took months and years to come out. It was the cold war, and an admission of error seemed an admission of weakness.
In the Challenger case, NASA had been under great pressure to design a truck to the skies. Its claims about the economic efficiency of the shuttle depended on an aggressive schedule of launchings, upwards of 24 a year. Bad news about O-rings and burn-throughs and evidence of flights that nearly ended in calamity were suppressed. Now the shuttle schedule is more reasonable; the Columbia flight was delayed for two years.
But the pressures for faster-better-cheaper still exist, and there is little evidence that the agency is getting the best new scientific and engineering minds it attracted in the glory days of space exploration. Today, the number of NASA employees older than 60 is nearly three times greater than the number under 30. 
A General Accounting Office report published in January notes that in 2001, just as President Bush was coming to office, "NASA's shuttle work force had declined significantly in recent years to the point of reducing NASA's ability to safely support the shuttle program," and many of those who remained "showed signs of overwork and fatigue."
While the agency has begun to address the issues, the report indicated, "these challenges have not been mitigated."
The strategy the agency is following now is to extend the life of the shuttles to 2020 -- a strategy that may require significant review if it turns out that the Columbia's age, or some kind of structural failure, contributed to the disaster.
One major question is whether the panel of outsiders Mr. O'Keefe appointed on Saturday will have the mandate or the political heft to address those questions. That is the advantage of a presidential commission, like the one President Ronald Reagan appointed, run by former Secretary of State William P. Rogers. Even that commission was charged with whitewashing the worst news out of the Challenger disaster because Mr. Reagan made it clear he wanted NASA strengthened. But there is a risk, former members of the Challenger commission noted today, that any panel without presidential authority could end up ratifying the status quo.

 "All week, everyone talked about 'the game,' and it was the women's game," said Heidi Hullinger, a distance runner at Duke. "It shows that a big matchup can hold the interest of an entire university." 
 The 9,314 who bought tickets to Cameron's first sellout for women, and others who watched on national television, were rewarded with a tense, breathtaking match between Duke and Connecticut, No. 1 versus No. 2, the last undefeated teams in major college basketball, sneakered infantry on the battle lines of Title IX.
UConn took a 51-23 lead, then Duke woke up, whittling its deficit to 71-65 before losing, 77-65. The game reconfirmed that given equal opportunity, determined university support and suitable news media attention, women can provide competition every bit as engaging and remunerative as their counterparts on men's teams. These were women at their finest, demonstrating great skill, purposeful teamwork, the awakening of youth, a taut refusal to succumb.
"It proves there is a big fan base for women's sports, that it's not just a charity cause," Amelia Booth, a rower at Duke, said.
On the court, these were true student-athletes. Every player who completes her basketball eligibility at the two universities graduates, year after year. For too many men, college is a delusional steppingstone to the pros. For women, it's more often a chance to have an education.
And yet, this galvanizing moment was flecked with wariness. Title IX, the 1972 law that forbids gender discrimination at universities receiving federal funds, is under the threat of rollback by the Bush administration. There is growing fear among advocates of women's sports that opportunities may soon disappear, as UConn's 28-point lead nearly did.
It can only be hoped that UConn-Duke was a sign of what is to be enhanced, not diminished. As the Huskies rebuffed the Blue Devils, so did they rebuke the myth that women are not as interested in sports as men. There is no evidence of this. We know only that women have had many fewer decades in which to express their interest.
As USA Today recently noted, a federal court ruling in a Title IX case involving Brown University remarked that the larger number of men in athletics reflected historical discrimination, not lesser interest among women.
"Interest and ability rarely develop in a vacuum," the court noted. "They evolve as a function of opportunity and experience."
Athletes from Duke's track, crew and lacrosse squads helped to fill Cameron in a rah-rah sisterhood of support for the basketball team. It was a night to celebrate women, too long seen as the enemy, cleverly pitted by football against nonrevenue men's sports and made the scapegoat for dwindling men's teams in wrestling, gymnastics and swimming.
Women have become a convenient but misdirected target. Consider this about wrestling: According to the Coalition for Women and Girls in Education, 53 wrestling programs were cut from 1984 to 1988, during a period when Title IX enforcement was suspended by the United States Supreme Court, and 55 programs were pared over the next 12 years, after the law was restored. This suggests wrestling is a victim of market forces and opportune pruning, not women's intrusion.
Women are not forcing the curtailment of some men's teams. Rather, it is a failure of imagination and commitment by many universities and an unwillingness to confront the money pit of football. Football should receive favorable treatment because it brings in millions of dollars, its supporters argue. Yet, according to various surveys taken by women's groups, half to two-thirds of football teams operate in the red, meaning they don't even pay for themselves, much less other teams on campus.
There is no reason that universities need 85 football players on scholarship, when N.F.L. teams limit rosters to 53, even though they face yearly free-agent turnover in numbers similar to graduation. A reduction in 25 scholarships would save $750,000 to $800,000, estimates Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College, enough to pay for wrestling and another sport. Not coincidentally, Duke and UConn are universities at which the football tail does not wag the academic dog.
After Saturday's great escape, UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said he had never heard a crowd so loud as when Duke made its furious second-half charge. He had witnessed a mesmerizing contest, featuring the country's two best players. Alana Beard willed Duke back into the game, then Diana Taurasi countered with two important baskets for UConn. At the end, Taurasi pumped her fist at the Duke students who had taunted her, putting her thumb and little finger to her face, gesturing, "Give me a call."
"This Title IX stuff drives me nuts," Auriemma said. "Hopefully, people are watching and say, 'Why would you want to mess with anything that can be this good?' "

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: FLORIDA; 
Grief Is Mixed With Worries For Economy On Canaveral

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Feb. 2 

 BODY:
A day of worship turned into a day of mourning today as residents of this Space Coast region came to church to pray for the families of the Columbia crew and for their own livelihoods.
 At the Park Avenue Baptist Church in Titusville, the Rev. Richard Lord addressed a congregation of about 1,600 people with a message of unity. He told the worshipers that he had received condolences from church leaders as far away as Ireland. 
 "People all over the world are praying," Mr. Lord said. "God is going to carry us through this."
"We have lost the personal contact with astronauts and with some of the families," he said, but he added, "We have to stand together."
At the First Baptist Church of Merritt Island, the Rev. Curt Dodd pointed out that people here had a special link to the shuttle.
"I pray especially for the family members and the employees of NASA and the contractors involved with the space program," Mr. Dodd said in leading worshipers in prayer. "Many in this congregation have touched with their hands Columbia."
Beyond the emotional toll of the space shuttle loss, many church services touched on the potential for great economic loss for the region. "We are so dependent on the space program," the Rev. Ray Johnson of the First Baptist Church of Titusville told parishioners. "If you want to pray to protect your job, it is O.K. We pray in our weakness that our economic health will be vital."
Indeed, some people said that beyond the thoughts and prayers for the astronauts' families, they were also concerned about the possible economic effects caused by delays in future shuttle launches.
"There is no doubt there will be an impact on the economy," said Bob Hudson, 82, a former owner of The Star Advocate in Titusville, who attended a church service at the First United Methodist Church there. "We felt the impact after the Challenger," Mr. Hudson said of the 1986 explosion of that space shuttle. "We had a recession."
Karen Forester, executive housekeeper at the Holiday Inn in Titusville, said a big part of the hotel's business was from guests who came to watch shuttle launchings. "Most of our revenue is generated from shuttle launches, so if launches were postponed, it would have a huge impact on our business," she said.
At the Kennedy Space Center's visitors complex, thousands of Floridians and vacationers gathered, carrying flowers and heavy hearts. "I am feeling heartbroken," said Larry Kornweiss of Orlando. "I came over here this morning to pay my respects. Things like this bring people closer together. We should work as one and focus on each other."
Dave Sayles of nearby Merritt Island, wearing an American flag emblem on a blue shirt, showed up to play bagpipes at the site of the Astronauts Memorial Foundation, based at the space center. People wept as he played "Amazing Grace." "I just felt I had to do this," Mr. Sayles said, his voice quavering.
Dr. Stephen Feldman, president of the foundation, said a steady stream of mourners had visited the site since the early morning hours. "People are looking for a place to mourn and express their grief," he said.
Valerie Hesser of London, Ontario, sobbed as she looked at the names of the dead astronauts. "We have a daughter that wants to fly the shuttle," she said. "I feel for the families," she added, unable to speak further and hugging her family for support.
Ilyse Gerber of Orlando said he was drawn to the space center to express his grief and added that he wanted the space program to continue. "I hope the space program will move forward without batting an eye so the government can say we are strong."
Rick Schult, a geophysicist at Patrick Air Force Base near here, who had attended a service at St. Luke's Episcopal Church in Cape Canaveral, said he and his wife tried to explain the loss to their two young sons. It was the second such conversation since the Sept. 11 terror attacks, Mr. Schult said. "We just said that like the airplane that ran into the building, people die and sometimes bad things happen."
At the Prince of Peace Lutheran Church in Orlando, Dave Parsch, the pastor, prayed for the astronauts' families. "We ask God to wrap his arms around them," he said.
Some people said they attended the church services to honor the astronauts for their bravery.
"They were people who sacrificed themselves for the good of mankind," said Marlene Schmidt of Orlando. "They gave their lives to bring something back for us. They sacrificed themselves not only for America but the whole world."

HEADLINE: When a Mantra Against Taxes Starts to Seem Unspeakable 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

 BODY:
In this season of State of the State addresses and budget rollouts, the region's three governors have nothing good to say. They have no money, they will not find more soon, and they have to inflict pain just to keep their governments in business. 
 Govs. George E. Pataki of New York, James E. McGreevey of New Jersey and John G. Rowland of Connecticut are all suffering the damage from the Sept. 11 attack and the battering of the financial services industry, damage made worse by their states' heavy reliance on personal income taxes. 
 At the same time, all three governors have said they will not propose raising taxes.
How each fares under threat of fiscal calamity will tell much about the future of their parties -- Mr. Pataki and Mr. Rowland are Republicans, Mr. McGreevey is a Democrat -- and about public tolerance for higher taxes. At the least, they will be forced into a discussion that in recent years has frightened politicians even more than voters. That issue is whether, after a spree of tax-cutting in the 1990's, any governor can reverse direction, whether by force of personality or the political skill to make it appear that a tide of protest compelled it. 
Even while 41 states fell short of revenue projections in the last fiscal year, according to the National Governors Association, those nearest New York are more broke than most. The deficit that Mr. Pataki projects for the coming fiscal year is more than 10 percent of the state's current budget; Mr. McGreevey's is about 21 percent; and Mr. Rowland's is 15 percent. Nationwide, the average is 5 percent to 15 percent. 
But even since the last downturn, a decade ago, "there has been a shift in the climate," said Raymond C. Scheppach, the executive director of the governors association. "When I look at the '92 recession, they closed those gaps two-thirds by raising taxes and one-third by cutting spending. Now it looks like the reverse is happening."
In his budget address to the Legislature last week, Mr. Pataki said he refused to consider "job-killing taxes." Mr. McGreevey, who is to announce his budget plan tomorrow, still promises no increase in the income, sales or business taxes -- but last week made several proposals that would cut benefits and tax rebates to high earners. 
Mr. Rowland, who campaigned in 1994 on a promise to eliminate the income tax, startled people by agreeing in December to the "millionaire tax" he vetoed in the spring. Now he threatens to veto a Democratic plan extending the increases to incomes over $50,000. 
So far, the governors would rather shrink their governments. Mr. Pataki's plan cuts deeply into education and health care. Mr. Rowland has already laid off state workers and wants more concessions. Mr. McGreevey promises deeper cuts in government operations across the board, though some administration officials say privately that such reductions cannot come close to bridging the $5 billion budget gap that he projects. 
Mr. Pataki and Mr. Rowland, both running for re-election last year, were reluctant to mention either higher taxes or cuts in services -- which, their critics say, has made the recent reckoning that much tougher. 
"The state's budget gap really emerged last year, but it was papered over," said Frank J. Mauro, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute in Albany, a state tax research group. "The governor got through the election without having to talk about it."
Mr. Mauro said that when the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, estimated last summer that the state faced a shortfall of $8 billion to $10 billion in the 2004 fiscal year, administration officials quickly replied that the data was not fully researched. Mr. Bruno, a Republican, "turned out to be uncannily accurate," Mr. Mauro said: the governor's own estimate of next year's deficit is $9.3 billion. 
Mr. McGreevey, meanwhile, having taken office just last year, has had the comparative luxury of pleading poverty at every turn, and blaming his Republican predecessors. Now Republicans accuse the governor of painting doomsday situations to soften the climate for tax increases, and many Democrats as well say he might approve them if he can blame the Legislature.
But legislators, who are all up for re-election this year, are steering clear of the idea. And Mr. McGreevey, like Mr. Pataki, says the solution is not higher taxes but "cutting government to the bone, to its essentials," said his press secretary, Micah Rasmussen. 
"That's what the population wants, isn't it?" said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com, a national consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. "That's politically the most palatable approach, to cut." 
Public opinion surveys indicate, however, that voters can endorse a tax increase on very high incomes.
In a poll released Thursday by the University of Connecticut Center for Survey Research and Analysis, 78 percent of those surveyed said they supported the Rowland plan, raising the top bracket to 5.5 percent from 4.5 percent on income over $1 million.
A Quinnipiac University poll, released the same day, showed 58 percent of respondents in New Jersey approving higher income taxes on "the wealthy." The governor "doesn't need a poll to tell him he can get away with that," said Clay Richards, the assistant director of the poll. 
The Connecticut proposal and a similar plan circulating in New Jersey would raise no more than a few hundred million dollars a year, where billions are needed. And both states, already highly dependent on millionaires, have fewer than they did a few years ago.
"There are a lot of Republican governors advocating tax increases," said Michael Mazerov, a state tax analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. "If anything, it seems to me there are more Republican governors recommending tax increases than Democrats."
A few of Mr. Pataki's and Mr. McGreevey's proposals do in effect raise taxes. Governor Pataki wants to eliminate the sales tax exemption on clothing under $110. Mr. McGreevey does not rule out means-testing; last week he proposed an assets test for applicants for a state-subsidized program for prescription drugs and the elimination of property-tax rebates for households making more than $100,000 a year. And his "restructuring" -- he refused to call it an increase -- of the corporate business tax last year nearly doubled payments.

HEADLINE: Behind Walkout by Doctors, Chronic War With Lawyers 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
Mindy Cohen lives a reclusive life marked by fistfuls of painkillers and the drone of daytime television.
 A former school psychologist who lives in Randolph, Ms. Cohen, 47, has been largely bedbound since 1997, when doctors were forced to remove a portion of her thigh after a liposuction procedure went awry. The unceasing pain, the narcotic-induced fog and the crushing depression, she said, make mundane activities nearly impossible. 
 "I desperately miss being out in the world," said Ms. Cohen, who took part in a news conference last week featuring several medical malpractice victims. "I'm just a shell of a person." 
Dr. Elliot Kaplan, a thoracic surgeon in Morristown, endures a different sort of anguish, one brought on by what he and his colleagues describe as a malpractice insurance crisis in New Jersey. He was forced to stop working for a month after malpractice insurers in the state, calling his specialty a magnet for litigation, refused to issue him a policy. When he finally found one last January, his annual premium, $60,000, was 40 percent higher than the previous year's for just a third of the coverage.
With reimbursements from health maintenance organizations and Medicare holding steady or falling, Dr. Kaplan, 44, wonders how much longer he can keep working in New Jersey. "I'm very anxious because I love what I do," he said. "But if there are any more increases, I won't be able to remain in practice." 
The battle between physicians like Dr. Kaplan and lawyers representing patients like Ms. Cohen has been waged in fits and starts for decades. But it will escalate as never before when a one-day walkout on Monday by thousands of doctors across New Jersey leaves private practices shuttered and elective surgeries postponed.
The showdown follows similar strikes by doctors in West Virginia and Nevada that sought to limit what critics say is an explosion of sky-high jury awards that saddle doctors with the cost of turning malpractice victims into millionaires.
President Bush, too, has taken aim at what he describes as "frivolous lawsuits" and is pressing Congress to pass legislation that would limit malpractice awards.
In New Jersey, the war is being waged with sober statistics and emotional claims. Malpractice victims speak of botched procedures and lives destroyed while doctors recite stories of patients, and of lawyers, who are awarded millions of dollars they do not necessarily deserve.
Insurance experts and consumer advocacy groups say that focusing solely on huge awards further muddies a complex problem that requires more than just a $250,000 limit on pain-and-suffering awards, the goal sought by doctors in New Jersey. The entire insurance industry, these experts say, suffers from a chronic malady stemming from the way malpractice insurers invest their premiums, a business model that turns customers into cash machines during economic downturns.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners counters that insurance companies are prudent investors. A study by the association found that only a quarter of insurance companies' assets were invested in stocks in 2001.
The consumer groups say that the rush to cap awards ignores the problem of medical negligence in America, which accounts for 44,000 to 98,000 preventable deaths a year, according to a 1999 study by the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences. "The so-called crisis with medical malpractice is another symptom of a health care system that is broken and out of control," said Dena Mottola, acting director of the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group. "There's a lot of misinformation out there, but whether or not you agree with the numbers, until we fix the underlying problems, nothing will change."
For the moment, medical professionals in New Jersey are united in their belief that aggressive lawyers and greedy patients are to blame for the spike in premiums. Many doctors see their fight against large malpractice payouts as part of a noble stand against freewheeling litigation, an issue that riles many Americans. "It's more than just a medical problem, it's a societal problem," said Dr. Donald Allegra, an infectious-disease specialist in central New Jersey, who said he planned to treat only the most gravely ill patients on Monday. "I've never seen doctors so galvanized by an issue." 
But an unlikely coalition of trial lawyers and consumer watchdog groups say that doctors and insurers are overstating the problem of runaway malpractice payments. Although big headline-grabbing awards have increased, state figures show the overall number of malpractice cases dropped to 1,650 last year, from 1,780 in 1998, a 7 percent decrease that many attribute to a 1995 state law intended to weed out baseless lawsuits. And despite a shift toward bigger awards, the total amount of money paid out to patients rose only 2 percent, to $235 million in 2001, from $231 million in 1998. 
The two sides in the debate over caps disagree over whether they would have a real impact on rising premiums. A study by Medical Liability Monitor, a trade publication, found that premiums in the 25 states with award limits did not decline, although they did rise a little more slowly than in states without them. One exception was California, which has a $250,000 cap, and where premiums have grown only half as fast as the national average. But consumer advocates attribute that to legislation, adopted in 1988, that strictly regulates the insurance industry.
Still, a study commissioned by the Medical Society of New Jersey, which supports Monday's walkout, found that caps alone would reduce premiums by 7 percent. 
In aiming to reduce payouts for pain and suffering, the society is not seeking to limit monetary awards that help an injured patient pay for medical care and provide income lost as a result of a malpractice-related disability. But because such economic damages are partly based on a victim's salary at the time of the injury, consumer groups and lawyers say that the poor, the elderly, women and children tend to receive negligible payments. Their only recourse, the advocates say, is the pain-and-suffering category.
In recent years, such awards in New Jersey have averaged $300,000, Ms. Mottola said. "If you're poor and the victim of malpractice that leaves you disfigured or in chronic pain, you're not going to be living high on the hog with that kind of money," she said.
A medical society spokesman, John Shaffer, said that more and more people are treating the tort system like the lottery. In the late 1990's, one of the state's largest malpractice insurers, Princeton Insurance, reported three to four payments in excess of $1 million each year. Now the company pays out such amounts almost weekly, he said. "There's absolutely no formula for a jury to use when figuring out these awards," he said. "If you can make a jury feel bad for you, you can get $4 million."
Dr. Robert S. Rigolosi, president of the medical society, said that because of this, many doctors are leaving the state and some are retiring early. Countless others, Dr. Rigolosi said, are avoiding performing difficult procedures, a defensive strategy that effectively limits public access to health care.
"These jackpot awards are the problem," he said. "They're sacrificing the health care of millions of people in New Jersey."
The uproar over malpractice insurance rates is not new. Twice before, during recessions in the mid-1970's and mid-1980's, doctors were buffeted by soaring premiums. Although a handful of states addressed the problem, the issue faded away as the economy recovered, insurance company profits rose and premiums stabilized or fell.
Opponents of limits say that doctors, swayed by misinformation from insurers, have overlooked the connection between high premiums and the health of Wall Street. Because companies plow a portion of their premiums into the bond and stock markets, lower investment yields often lead to higher insurance rates.
In New Jersey, the down side of this industry cycle has been compounded by the insolvency of two large insurers and the decision by a third to withdraw from the malpractice market. "The doctors have misdiagnosed the illness and prescribed the wrong cure," said Bruce H. Stern, president of the Trial Lawyers Association of New Jersey. "The real problem is bad business decisions by malpractice insurance companies."
Others say the debate over rising malpractice rates ignores other factors, including sloppy health care and a system in New Jersey that critics say fails to deal with the handful of doctors who commit the lion's share of malpractice. Citing federal statistics, Public Citizen, a consumer group in Washington, said that fewer than 6 percent of all doctors in New Jersey accounted for 60 percent of the state's malpractice payments during the 1990's. Public Citizen and others contend that such "repeat offenders" often go unpunished by state regulators, contributing to the rise in premiums. 
Patients like Ms. Cohen say that pain-and-suffering awards also serve to make doctors more cautious. "It isn't a get-rich-quick scheme," she said. "It's about fairness for people who get harmed."

HEADLINE: WOMEN'S ATHLETICS; 
Staying Power Is Lingering Question

BYLINE:  By LENA WILLIAMS 

 BODY:
"No one ever said it was going to be easy," said Lynn Morgan, president and chief executive of the Women's United Soccer Association. "Leagues take time to establish themselves."
 The Women's National Basketball Association is six years old, and the W.U.S.A. is two years old. Now they appear to be at a crossroads, struggling with their evolution from single-entity ownership start-up operations to profitable enterprises. 
 Two W.N.B.A. teams have folded and two have relocated since the N.B.A., which owned and operated the league's teams, voted last October to allow individual ownership. The Miami Sol and the Portland Fire are gone, leaving two dozen players out of work. Next season, the Orlando Miracle will be playing at a casino in Uncasville, Conn., and the Utah Starzz will be playing in San Antonio. 
The players want a new collective bargaining agreement, a pay raise and free agency, and they have threatened to strike if they do not get what they consider a fair deal. W.N.B.A. officials met with the players union last Wednesday to discuss employment issues created by the league's contraction to 14 teams. But the players have voiced displeasure over the pace and the tenor of contract talks.
"A lot has been going on, and the players are certainly concerned about a number of changes over the past few months and how they will impact us," said Sonja Henning, president of the players association and a guard with the Seattle Storm. "The fact that it's now January and we haven't had a meaningful negotiation is also raising concerns."
The W.U.S.A. has its own problems. The league is trying to raise its profile and increase attendance, television ratings and revenue. To cut costs, the W.U.S.A. moved its headquarters from New York to Atlanta last year and streamlined its front office staff. Attendance was down by 15 percent in the second season. Television ratings were so low that the Turner network decided to stop broadcasting games after the first season. The league is in the second season of a two-year deal with Paxson Communications to broadcast games.
"It's no secret that in these times, most professional sports are struggling financially and you don't want to see anyone fold, from women's sports teams to hockey teams to baseball teams," said Tiffeny Milbrett, a forward with the New York Power and the league's most valuable player in 2001. "But you deal with realities, and we understand that the W.U.S.A. is a pioneer for women's sports around the world."
The challenges the W.N.B.A. and W.U.S.A. face have raised questions about the viability of women's summer sports leagues and single-ownership leagues. Neither the W.U.S.A. nor the W.N.B.A. has made a profit.
"The W.N.B.A. made one fundamental error that it has never recovered from by insisting teams play in N.B.A. cities," said Lawrence Gottesdiener, chairman and chief executive of the Northland Investment Corporation. Northland, a real-estate development firm, made a bid to take a W.N.B.A. franchise to Connecticut. Last week, the W.N.B.A. awarded the franchise to the Mohegan Sun casino.
"Those cities have access to myriad sports, including men's basketball," Gottesdiener said of N.B.A. cities. "The league has to go into markets that don't have access to men's pro sports."
But Val Ackerman, the W.N.B.A. president, and Morgan, of the W.U.S.A., said they would not necessarily do things differently if they were starting over.
"We would not have started the league under a different model," Ackerman said. "When we initiated the league we had the right start-up structure and right structure to incubate."
Most sports leagues lose money and most new sports leagues lose a lot of money, Ackerman said.
Morgan said that single-entity ownership "is the right way to go" for a start-up league.
"What you need to do during development is to control costs," she said. "You don't want renegade owners to be part of a start-up, making decisions that may not be in the best interests of the league."
The W.N.B.A. and the W.U.S.A. have exceeded their attendance projections -- 6,000 and 6,500 a game, respectively -- though attendance in each league slipped last season to about 8,500 fans in the W.N.B.A. and to about 6,900 in the W.U.S.A. 
The leagues' problems may be a reflection of the battle for fans and sponsors in a fluctuating economy. Nevertheless, advocates of women's sports worry that any signs of weakness could have a devastating effect on women's professional sports in the United States and abroad.
"Just as it's important for Major League Soccer to be successful for the good of the sport, it's equally important for the W.N.B.A. to be successful for the good of women's sports," Morgan said. "The W.N.B.A. is brave enough and wise enough to know that in order to take that next leap, they've got to make some changes."
Supporters of the W.N.B.A. and the W.U.S.A. say the leagues' troubles may be exaggerated.
There has been attendance erosion and small television ratings, but Milbrett said she thought there might be a simple explanation for the low television ratings for the eight-team W.U.S.A.
"People can't watch the games if they don't know where to find them on TV or when they are on," she said. "To increase the TV ratings, we've got to be able to market the games better and obtain an ideal time slot so we can attract the maximum amount of viewers from our demographic and from regular sports fans."
W.N.B.A. and W.U.S.A. supporters also point to the troubles of the highly promoted XFL, which was gone after one dismal season and millions of dollars in losses. Meanwhile, the the National Women's Football Association, a pro league, will be entering its third season in April.
The National Women's Basketball League, a pro league, begins its third season next week with W.N.B.A. stars like Sue Bird, Tina Thompson, Nikki McCray and Swin Cash. Its season ends in April, before W.N.B.A. training camps start.
Their problems notwithstanding, the W.N.B.A. and the W.U.S.A. are drawing interest from investors who want to acquire franchises. Northland and the Mohegan Sun casino both sought to obtain one of the three defunct W.N.B.A. teams. The rights to the Orlando franchise were sold to the Mohegan tribe, which owns and operates the casino.
Other cities have approached the league about investing in new franchises, league officials said.
That response has convinced Ackerman that the change in ownership direction has put the league on the right track. She said the W.N.B.A. would most likely be back to 16 teams by the 2004 season.
Ackerman said the change in ownership structure would benefit teams "in terms of long-term prospects."
"Teams will have revenue opportunities they didn't have under the original model in the form of expanded local sponsorships," she said.
W.N.B.A. players are scattered around the world and are only beginning to weigh in on the effect the restructuring may have on the league, their lives and livelihood. Pamela M. Wheeler, the union's director of operations, said the change made sense.
"It's indicative of what we believed or thought would happen: that the league would go into markets where it made sense for W.N.B.A. basketball and for the league to be successful," she said.
Henning, the Seattle guard, said the restructuring could give players greater flexibility to market themselves and allow for some form of free agency, issues that have been raised in contract talks.
"Individual owners paying salaries leads right into free agency," Henning said. "The same with marketing rights. With teams given greater opportunity to go out and market teams, players should have better opportunities to go out and recruit sponsors."
There may be difficult days ahead, but Ackerman sees a new day not only for the W.N.B.A. but also for women's sports in general.
"All leagues have to find their own way and restructuring is our way of finding ours," Ackerman said. "We here remain optimistic about the prospect for women's team sports. The interest continues to grow, particularly at the youth level. We're at the apex of our sport. And we still have the N.B.A. behind us."

HEADLINE: A Time of Mourning for Shattered Dreams; 
Israelis Grieve

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Israel is gripped with the horrendous news about the space shuttle Columbia, the six American astronauts killed and, of course, our own Ilan Ramon -- the first Israeli in space (front page, Feb. 2). 
Our deep involvement in the shuttle mission, through Colonel Ramon and the Tel Aviv University scientific experiments, was a tremendous source of pride in these dark times of terror and recession in Israel. 
 The tragedy was a psychic roller coaster ride, from the heights of pure exhilaration to the depths of shocked, disbelieving grief, all in a space of a few minutes. Israelis shared one collective thought: finally something good happens to us -- and then this! 
 Once again, the fates of America and Israel seem, somehow, to be woven together. We grieve for you -- and you, for us.

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: ISRAEL; 
After Sending an Experiment and a Hero Into Space, Israeli Students Grieve

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: QIRYAT MOTZKIN, Israel, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The experiment was envisioned as pure science -- how crystals grow in space -- but nothing in Israel is completely sealed off from politics.
 The students at the high school here decided to use cobalt and calcium for their experiment that was put aboard the space shuttle Columbia. Their crystals would be blue and white, the colors of the Israeli flag, an expression of their pride in their country and in its first astronaut, Col. Ilan Ramon. 
 Today, with the delicate crystals lost in white streaks across the blue Texas skies, the students searched for further meaning in the disaster.
"Maybe someone didn't want us to be happy," Dor Zafrir, a 16-year-old in torn jeans and work boots, said of Colonel Ramon's voyage. "No matter what we do, nothing comes up right." The voyage, he said, "was almost the only good thing in Israel."
Israel reeled today from the loss on Saturday of Colonel Ramon, who flew with six Americans aboard Columbia. Flags flew at half staff, and radio stations played the sorrowful ballads that are usually heard in the aftermath of attacks here.
At the beginning of his weekly cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon sent condolences to the United States. He spoke of Colonel Ramon as "a man who should not have been taken from us so suddenly, along with the hopes, dreams, history and future of all of us, to a place higher than we can realize."
With their hero's homecoming denied in the final minutes of his flight, many Israelis wrestled with a crushing disappointment, and with a more familiar sense of despair. In the newspaper Haaretz, Ari Shavit wrote of "this hope that keeps shattering, the hope of freeing ourselves from our gravitational destiny, of floating in some weightless normalcy in utter disregard of the gravity of our existence."
Students here are accustomed to that gravity. To reach school, they pass through a guarded steel fence, then walk by a memorial to graduates who have died fighting in the army.
Almost four years ago, this school in northern Israel selected about 35 of its students to compete in a NASA program to send high school experiments into space. The students gathered after classes for extra work in astrophysics, as they tried to dream up an experiment worthy of a trip into space. In the end, they wanted to know how crystals would grow if they were freed of gravity. 
NASA picked experiments from six high schools worldwide. Photographs of the Israelis' "chemical garden" sent back from Columbia told the students that their experiment had yielded an intriguing result. While on earth both materials fought gravity to grow upward, in space the calcium crystals grew in the shape of a sphere, while the cobalt "was all messed up, like spaghetti," said Pini Shekhper, 14. Pini and his friends were hoping that when they analyzed the crystals, they would find the reason. 
Today, after students here passed the memorial to fallen graduates and walked into the school's entrance hall, they saw flickering votive candles. The candles were set out beneath pictures cut from newspapers of Columbia's lost crew and of the stunned, aching expression of Colonel Ramon's wife, Rona, when she learned that her husband was not coming home. The colonel, 48, had four children, ages 14, 12, 9 and 5.
"From the heavens, he was supposed to emerge like some sort of messiah," read a poem laid before this memorial.
Members of the scientific team assembled in the office of the principal, Marga Segal. 
On a sheet of black paper, someone had scribbled the word "consolation" in white. The students had then contributed their comforting thoughts -- "for science," "national pride," "role model" and "hero." On a second, white sheet, the word "disaster" was written in black, along with others like "sadness," "injustice" and "sympathy with the families."
The students had met once with Colonel Ramon. "I had a lot of hopes for Ilan and the other astronauts," said Adar Moritz, 17. "It was a disaster for me."
The students were solemn about the shuttle's loss, but they could still tease each other, to bursts of laughter, about their sudden celebrity. At such moments, they seemed like young people anywhere.
But they are young people in Israel, and so they spoke about the national troubles from which the shuttle's voyage and their experiment had distracted them: the miserable economy, Israel's ethnic and religious divides, the conflict with the Palestinians. They spoke about a temptation to leave the country, about a choice between doing what is best for one's family and what is best for one's nation.
Ilana Zibenberg, 16, spoke of the many options that Americans have after high school. "We have to go to the army," she said. "In the army, we lose a lot of friends, mostly boys."
The students wondered if Israel, and Jews, were being singled out for suffering. Some noted that there was also a Jewish astronaut aboard the Challenger when it exploded in 1986.
Many Israelis talked today about coincidence, fate or God, about how a spacecraft carrying the first Israeli astronaut could break up over the town of Palestine, Tex. The journalist Arik Bechar captured this reaction in a column today in Maariv.
"Ilan Ramon fell victim to the same curse that has turned the Israelis into a paranoid people," he wrote. "And how can they be blamed? The representatives of 30 nations have already hitched a ride with the American space fleet, and all of them returned safely to Earth to be able to tell their grandchildren, when the day comes, that the tortured Earth looks much better from afar."
But, Mr. Bechar concluded, "history will remember Ilan Ramon not as the victim of a collective Jewish sin, but as another Israeli pioneer who fell before the camp."
Dor, who gathered members of the science team at his house Saturday night, said: "It makes you doubt your dreams. But you can't give up. Especially with our situation here in Israel, we can't afford to give up."

HEADLINE: Patents; 
The patent office gains ground in its quest to keep more of what it receives in fees from customers.

BYLINE:  By Sabra Chartrand 

 BODY:
AS the battle over the 2004 federal budget begins this week, many government agencies will argue that their piece of the fiscal pie should increase so they can reverse the nation's economic doldrums with increased productivity and new jobs. The Patent and Trademark Office is not shy about promoting itself as the source of many ideas for products and services. As such, it has argued for years that it should keep all the money it earns from customer fees, rather than watch as Congress diverts substantial chunks to other parts of government.
 It will not get that wish when President Bush announces his budget proposal this week. But last week, agency leaders wanted to talk about how pleased they were with the progress they say they have made -- the president's budget returns even more of the agency's money from fees than last year, holding back only about $100 million. 
 And they say that the administration has promised to end such diversions altogether. 
"We've been working with the administration and the secretary of commerce to get focus on the importance of the Patent and Trademark Office," said Jon W. Dudas, a Bush appointee who is deputy director of the agency. "In the last year, there's been a sea change."
If that is true, it is also because Congress succeeded in getting the agency to focus on its problems. In recent years, the time it takes to process a patent application -- the patent pending, or pendancy, period -- is now 25 months. Application backlogs are enormous, and questions about training and layoffs of patent examiners have led to concerns about the quality of patents being issued. Finally, Congress demanded that the agency address these problems. The result was a new plan.
"Congress has been very clear about where they want us to direct our energy, what expectations they have, and that's the reason for the strategic plan," Mr. Dudas said. "The status quo was not lumbering along. Pendancy was dramatically rising; backlogs were rising; questions of quality were rising." 
The agency hopes to be rewarded for good behavior. In the budget proposal, Mr. Dudas expects the agency to get back 40 percent more of what it considers its money than it received in the 2003 budget. The president's proposal will earmark $1.4 billion for the patent office, Mr. Dudas said. In 2003, the office lost $162 million of that money to other branches of government.
"This year it is slightly under $100 million," he said. "And this is at a time when we are potentially going to war and are exercising more fiscal discretion. So by all guesses, people would have expected that there would have been more fee diversion, and in fact, fee diversions have gone down by 40 percent."
Of course, Congress has to pass a budget, and that is another matter altogether. Congress often diverts money raised by fee-based agencies like the patent office from those agencies. Paradoxically, Congress is still struggling with the budget for the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1, forcing agencies like the patent office to operate on a continuing resolution for the 2002 budget. 
In addition, $201 million of the proposed $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2004 comes from an increase in customer fees that Congress has yet to approve.
"The president's budget presumes these fee increases," Mr. Dudas said in an interview in his office, overlooking the Potomac River. So the next order of business will be persuading Congress to change the fees.
It will be roughly a 15 to 20 percent fee increase for the average, run-of-the-mill application, Mr. Dudas said. Actual filing fees will drop, but new fees for research, examination, excessive claims and drawings will be added.
For example, inventors now submit an application with a roster of supporting "claims." The patent office cautions inventors that applications must "conclude with a claim or claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter that the applicant regards as the invention."
Claims "define the scope of the protection afforded by the patent" and are also used when "questions of infringement are judged by the courts," the agency says on its Web site. "More than one claim may be presented, provided they differ substantially from each other and are not unduly multiplied."
In recent years, an increasing number of computer-related and biotechnology patent applications have included hundreds if not thousands of claims. The agency has decided that such applications should be charged extra.
"If you have applicants with 5, or 10 or 5,000 claims paying the same amount, then someone is getting subsidized," Mr. Dudas explained. So with the fee increase comes a proposal to charge an extra $50 for each claim over 20. There will also be an extra charge for applications with more than 100 pages of drawings. The agency says it cannot manage without these new fees.
"Without the commitment we got from the Bush administration, and without the fee increases, we would see the status quo as continuing decline, as opposed to staying where we are right now," Mr. Dudas said. In fact, he added, without money to pay for the strategic plan, "by 2008, pendancy would be 46 and a half months on average" -- almost double the current average.
The agency hopes to use some of the money to move entirely from paper to electronic handling of patents and trademarks. The president's budget proposal will include $253 million to spend on information technology, the patent office says.
"We want end-to-end electronic processing on trademarks by the endof this year," Mr. Dudas said, "and end-to-end on patents by the end of fiscal year 2004."

HEADLINE: With Rise in Foreign Aid, Plans for a New Way to Give It 

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
When the Bush administration unveils its State Department budget for 2004 on Monday, it will call for the largest increase in foreignassistance in two decades. But more significantly, many experts say, it will introduce a new program that would begin overhauling the way America distributes aid to the poorest countries.
 Far more than in traditional aid programs, the new program, known as the Millennium Challenge Account, will demand that recipient states be accountable for the American tax dollars they spend. 
 Experts say the plan, which would operate in tandem with existing aid programs, reflects an ambitious effort by President Bush to place a Republican stamp on foreign aid, much as he has tried to do with federal education programs. 
In particular, the plan attempts to answer the longstanding conservative complaint that foreign aid has become global welfare: abused by corrupt regimes, squandered on ineffective projects and laxly monitored by liberal bureaucrats.
"The Millennium Challenge Account could be the leading wedge of change in the way we do foreign aid," said Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development, a poverty research group based in Washington. "It is an effort to make the business of aid much more businesslike."
Under the plan, the administration would give more aid to a smaller number of countries that can pass a rigorous set of "performance" criteria. To be eligible, countries would have to demonstrate a desire and ability to control corruption, defend political rights, invest in education and health care and promote free trade, among other things.
Recipients would sign multiyear "contracts" that could be canceled if the countries failed to show that they were improving the quality of life for their people and making political and economic reforms. The recipients would also be subject to financial audits, much like companies that get government business.
The program would be overseen by a government corporation of about 125 employees that would report to an executive board representing the Office of Management and Budget and the State and Treasury departments. Currently, most aid programs are administered by the United States Agency for International Development, a State Department unit widely reviled by Republicans as bureaucratic and inefficient.
The new plan, along with proposals by President Bush to increase spending to fight AIDS and reduce hunger overseas, would raise foreign assistance to more than $18 billion in the 2004 fiscal year, an increase of more than $2 billion, administration officials said. That would reverse a steady decline since the mid-1980's that has reduced foreign aid, based on 2002 dollars, to pre-World War II levels, experts said.
Coming at a time when the Bush administration has been criticized overseas for saber rattling against Iraq, the new programs could help show that the United States does not base its diplomacy entirely on military power, experts said. 
"There's no question this came out of a process after Sept. 11 in which President Bush and his advisers decided they needed to take some steps to exploit what can be called the soft power of the United States," Ms. Birdsall said. 
But the plan has also stirred concerns among some aid groups that Millennium Challenge will drain money from other State Department programs, including one intended to encourage democratic reforms in Middle Eastern countries. Few, if any, Middle Eastern countries will be eligible for Millennium Challenge money because of corruption, high income levels or lack of democratic rights, experts and administration officials said.
Aid groups have questioned the need for creating a new bureaucracy, which they say might lack expertise and be subject to political pressures from the White House.
"This has great potential for reform," said Mary E. McClymont, president and chief executive of InterAction, an umbrella organization for 160 aid groups. "But we hope the president will hold to his promise to make sure this is used to fight poverty. It should not become a diplomatic slush fund."
In general, however, the plan has won broad support, for one major reason: After watching Republicans slash at foreign aid budgets for many years, aid groups are relieved to see a conservative president embrace foreign aid with his own program. One result, they say, could be a bipartisan consensus behind foreign assistance for the first time since the cold war. 
"The big story is, the Bush administration has surprised us all and turned out to be a big promoter of aid, at least in rhetoric," said Scott B. Lasensky, an expert in foreign aid at the Council on Foreign Relations. "They've once believed foreign aid was money down a rat hole."
Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, said the amount proposed by Mr. Bush was still "woefully inadequate." But he called the plan "a constructive step because it targets additional aid to counties that are committed to ending corruption, reforming their economies and building democracy."
The president's budget will call for allocating $1.3 billion to Millennium Challenge in 2004, $2.6 billion in 2005 and $5 billion annually after that. Mr. Bush had pledged to spend $1.6 billion on the plan in 2004, but administration officials said they decided the program could not spend that much money in its first year. Officials say they do not intend to cut other foreign aid programs in 2004.
Under the administration's proposed criteria, fewer than a dozen countries would be eligible for money in 2004, officials said. A country would need to show per capita annual income below $1,435 and an ability to control corruption before being considered. Countries with higher income levels would be allowed to compete in 2005.
Applicants would have to perform well in as many as 16 categories, including civil liberties and political rights, immunization rates and primary education spending, credit ratings and deficit reduction.
Among the countries considered likely candidates for aid in the first year are Uganda, Mongolia, Bangladesh, Bolivia and Indonesia, administration officials and aid experts said.
Because the list is small, recipients would get much more than the typical foreign aid grant of today, which is about $50 million a year, a senior administration official said.
Although Republicans in Congress who have opposed foreign aid are likely to support the president's proposal, they may try to trim it to control the widening deficit.
"The challenge we'll have is with a Congress that is grappling with deficits," said Sam Stratman, spokesman for Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican who is chairman of the House International Relations Committee and a supporter of the aid program. "The president is going to have to make the case that this kind of foreign assistance enhances American security."

HEADLINE: In Albany, Letting the Heel-Digging Begin 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The parameters of the debate that will define state politics for the next several months have been set out in no uncertain terms: Gov. George E. Pataki would rather make deep cuts to core services like education and health care than raise taxes.
 Now begins the serious political maneuvering by a large cast of players: Democrats who control the State Assembly, Republicans who control the State Senate, union leaders, lobbyists and others in the villages, towns and cities where the proposed cuts hit home. The process will lead to the passage of a spending plan, though the route is likely to be difficult in a Statehouse plagued by dysfunction. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will address a joint legislative session on Monday, and will be the first person to visit the capital with a proverbial tin cup in hand since Mr. Pataki made his proposal last Wednesday. New York City faces harsh consequences if the budget proposed by Mr. Pataki -- a Republican, like the mayor -- passes in its current form.
The mayor is expected to press his case for more help in closing a $3.4 billion deficit in the city budget that takes effect on July 1. At the top of the wish list he will present to legislators: passage of a commuter tax that would give the city $1 billion in recurring money but is sure to incur the wrath of suburban lawmakers.
Other political leaders are meeting and planning their appeals for help. Unions are organizing protests and gearing up advertisements to pressure the governor.
"The governor has put out his budget and it is up to the Legislature to dispose of it," said Danny Donohue, the statewide president of the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents 265,000 workers in New York. "We will be taking ads, joining with social service and other groups, labor, religious, community groups, the Hunger Action Network, taxpayers groups. This budget scheme does not seem to help anybody."
Mr. Pataki holds most of the power over his $90.8 billion spending plan. And his reluctance to raise taxes on income has put both the Assembly Democrats and the Senate Republicans in a politically uncomfortable corner.
"The cuts the governor has proposed will be unacceptable to legislators of both parties, in both houses," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Democrat from Manhattan. "What legislator is going to want to return home and have every other classroom shut? Or see layoffs of teachers or getting rid of the art teacher or the music teacher?"
In recent interviews, lawmakers and others in both political parties said the pressure was already mounting from their constituents who want them to look for ways to restore the money for services the governor wants to cut, like prekindergarten classes and subsidized prescription drugs for the elderly.
On both sides of the aisle, legislators are accusing Governor Pataki of hypocrisy in insisting he will not raise "job killing" taxes while he proposes raising fees and surcharges. Among those would be fees on the sales of tires, a surcharge on hospital receipts, higher park fees and extra annual fees for nuclear power plant owners. The governor has also proposed removing a sales tax exemption on clothing. 
By framing the debate as a stark choice between taxes and jobs, the governor has put the onus of raising revenues on the lawmakers. And if they do not raise them, or find no other money to restore cuts, then the localities they represent will face steep local property tax increases to cover the costs, the lawmakers said.
The budget process traditionally involves legislators restoring spending that the governor proposed cutting. But the stakes are higher this year because of an $11.5 billion cumulative deficit, lower-than-expected tax collections and a stubborn national recession. 
"We all agree we want to get there," said Senator Nicholas A. Spano, a Republican from Westchester County. "How we get there will be the real challenge."
Democrats in the Assembly may be left with few negotiating tactics other than to delay and obstruct. Their goal is to save school aid, which the governor proposed cutting by $1.24 billion, including $218 million in spending for kindergarten and prekindergarten programs that were conceived by Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker, and are most desired in urban areas like New York City.
Mr. Silver can negotiate and join with Republican senators to pressure the governor. Though he opposes increasing income taxes, he said he would consider it as part of a broader package of revisions to Mr. Pataki's budget.
The situation is barely more comfortable for Republicans. Education is their priority, too. The governor authorized tuition increases of $1,200 a year at the state and city university systems and a 15-percent cut in base aid to community colleges. The governor cut about $1 million from a program that finances road and bridge construction, affecting Republicans in rural districts.
Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno has said that the Senate is examining the budget and trying to find new ways to pay for education and other programs.
Traditionally, the school aid numbers proposed by a governor are negotiated, several budget analysts said. "If it is unacceptable, then you've got to find ways of making it acceptable," said John McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Bruno. "And that is the challenge, not just for education but for other areas, though education is our No. 1 priority."
Perhaps the person who may be most able to influence the governor is not a legislator at all. It may be Dennis Rivera, the powerful president of the state health care union 1199/S.E.I.U. and an ally of the governor in his re-election campaign.
The union does not like the governor's budget. "We are going to do everything that we can to make our case to elected officials and the voters in the state of New York that the state should do a fair and responsible tax increase," said Jennifer Cunningham, the executive director of the union, "like a modest surcharge on the wealthiest New Yorkers, or a closing of corporate tax loopholes, before we look to make health care cuts of this magnitude." 
"We will talk to religious and community leaders across the state," she said. "We will make alliances with anyone who wants to work with us on this."

HEADLINE: As Reservists Are Called Up, Cities Bear Costs 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH 

 BODY:
As cities and towns across the country prepare for military reservists to be called up in the event of a war against Iraq, officials of New York City's Police and Fire Departments say they expect the impact on city services and budgets to be manageable.
 But Senator Charles E. Schumer said yesterday that the city was already paying $315,000 a week for the salaries of police and firefighter reservists who had been called to active duty. 
 The federal government eventually repays a portion of such costs, but in the meantime if more reservists are called up, the city may have to pay for additional overtime or hire new officers, firefighters and Emergency Medical Service workers, Mr. Schumer said. 
He said he planned today to ask the federal government to help pay any additional costs.
Citing the city's dire fiscal troubles and its need to remain vigilant against more terrorist attacks, Mr. Schumer said: "New York is being asked to do triple duty. We are dealing with economic problems caused by 9/11, we are dealing with security problems, and we are sending reservists overseas. And reservists are in the fire, police and E.M.T.'s in disproportionate numbers."
He said he he planned to write to the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, asking that they pay the cost of temporarily replacing police, firefighting and other emergency workers in the event of war.
There are 1,193 reservists among the city's 37,200 police officers, slightly more than 3 percent of the force, said the Police Department's chief spokesman, Michael P. O'Looney. Of those, 182 have been called up, he said. During the Persian Gulf war of 1991, 225 police reservists were called up, he added.
"At that level, it's something we can handle," Mr. O'Looney said. "But we are always concerned about a reduction in the size of the force."
Another law enforcement official, who would speak only on the condition that he not be identified, said that Police Department officials believed it was unlikely that any additional officer-reservists would be called up.
There are about 300 reservists among the city's 14,000 firefighters and E.M.S. workers, or about 2 percent of the total, said a Fire Department spokesman, Paul Iannizzotto.
"Even if all of them were called up, it would not affect staffing," Mr. Iannizzotto said. "We'd use overtime to fill in the blanks." 
According to a report prepared by Senator Schumer, the city, the state and Long Island are paying $375,000 a week in salaries to reservists who have been called up, a cost the report said could total $19 million by the end of the year.
If all area reservists are called up, New York City could pay as much as $120 million for their salaries without benefiting from their services, and the cost to Long Island could be $15 million, according to the report. If the city decided to compensate for half of that lost manpower by hiring new workers, the cost could be an additional $54 million.
Spokesmen for the unions representing the city's firefighters and police officers expressed some concern about the prospect of doing more with less.
"The ranks are already very thin, and a loss of manpower would just exacerbate that problem," said Albert W. O'Leary of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which represents New York's rank-and-file police officers. "Any further reduction will create a situation where crime is going to be allowed to flourish in some communities."
Peter L. Gorman, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, said, "If it's really just 300 reservists, I think the Fire Department can handle it with minimal difficulty."
Some reservists returned only a few months ago after being called up for duty following the attacks of 9/11, and some also served in the Persian Gulf war more than a decade ago.
Unlike that war, the looming conflict in Iraq could put a new strain on police, fire and emergency service workers, Senator Schumer said. Some people fear that a war in Iraq could make the United States a target for new terrorist attacks, just as staffing for domestic security is being taxed by call-ups.

HEADLINE: White House Letter; 
A President's Attention Is Turned Toward Space

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Bush had tears in his eyes on Saturday when he spoke the words that became the headline "The Columbia is lost" and vowed to the nation that America's journey into space would go on. In words that bore the strong religious stamp of Mr. Bush and his chief speechwriter, Michael Gerson, the president gave eloquent purpose to space exploration, saying that human beings were driven toward the darkness beyond their known world by "the inspiration of discovery and the longing to understand."
 But space program advocates and members of Congress said yesterday that Mr. Bush had until now shown little curiosity about NASA and its programs. He has never visited the Johnson Space Center in Houston, even as governor of Texas, and space advocates say he has largely delegated responsibility for NASA to Vice President Dick Cheney, who has close ties to Sean O'Keefe, the NASA administrator. 
 John H. Marburger III, Mr. Bush's science adviser, said he had not met with the president specifically about space exploration, and had instead spent large portions of his time on the technology of domestic defense. And although Mr. Bush spoke of the need for a strong NASA when he made stops near the Kennedy Space Center in Florida during the 2000 presidential campaign, he has made no major speeches about space during his time in the White House.
So far, space program advocates say, the president's major involvement in NASA has been to crack down on billions of dollars of cost overruns in the expansion of the International Space Station now orbiting Earth.
Why the lack of interest, if that is what it is? 
"There's no question that this president recognizes in the long term that the U.S. is not prepared to see China as the dominant power in space, and that is something that would happen if we allowed ourselves to continue to fall behind," said D. Allen Bromley, who was the White House science adviser to Mr. Bush's father. 
Nonetheless, Mr. Bromley said, "given the other pressures on this president, the problems of the economy, the problems of the international scene, he probably has had very little time or opportunity to really spend much time thinking about the future of the space program."
John M. Logsdon, the director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, agreed. "You can trace it to a personal judgment that of all the things he had to deal with, this was not that important and he left it to others," Mr. Logsdon said. "There's no evidence that it's been a high priority in his scheme of things."
In fact, said Howard E. McCurdy of American University, an expert on NASA management, the expectation has long been that Mr. Bush would announce a major new space initiative to finish the work his father had started. In 1989, the first President Bush stood on the steps of the Air and Space Museum in Washington and said the next goals of the space program were to go on to Mars and back to the moon. 
But Congress would not agree to finance the programs until the space station was paid for, in 2004, Mr. Bush's re-election year -- a politically opportune time for announcing a new space program to try to capture the imagination of Americans who have come to see rocket launchings as routine.
"We've been working on the vision thing," said Representative Tom DeLay, the new Republican majority leader, who represents Houston. The president, he added, "is totally committed to exploring space, but over this period of time he has been relying on O'Keefe."
Mr. Bush's relative silence, other space policy experts say, also reflects the unclear future of the space program itself since the days that John F. Kennedy framed it as a challenge to take on the Russians in a race to the moon, and Lyndon Johnson thrust it forward as a powerful element of his political agenda.
"The problem has been that we have not been able to reach anything like a national consensus on what the next step should be," Mr. Bromley said. "Many people felt, O.K., you've gotten to the moon, time to cut that off and spend the money on something different. No one since Kennedy has been as successful in making public the wonders that are available out there."
Mr. Bromley said that the obvious next steps of the program -- a manned space station on the moon and a manned flight to Mars -- would require enormous sacrifices at a time when Mr. Bush was already absorbed by the campaign against terrorism and now a sweeping investigation into what went wrong with the Columbia on Saturday morning.
"In the moon case, which would of course provide our great-grandchildren with a base for travel beyond the solar system, the question is cost," he said. "In going to Mars, the question has always been whether it was safe for astronauts to go outside the magnetic environment of Earth."
The experts say that Mr. Bush will now have to confront these questions sooner than he expected, and that in the coming months NASA will demand far more of his time. For now, Mr. Bush is about to make his first trip to the Johnson Space Center, for a memorial for the seven lost astronauts this Tuesday. 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 12, 2003

 CORRECTION:
The White House Letter column on Feb. 3, about President Bush's attitude toward space research, misspelled the given name of the science adviser to the first President Bush, who said that because of other pressing matters, the president has probably had little opportunity to think about the space program. He is D. Allan Bromley, not Allen.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times; 
For Old-School Coaches, the Troubling World of a New Era's Stars

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM C. RHODEN 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
THERE is no better place to begin the February push to March Madness than here in the desert at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. For nearly two decades, the Runnin' Rebels under Jerry Tarkanian became the hottest show in Las Vegas. U.N.L.V. won the national championship in 1990, but the basketball program was placed on probation twice and Tarkanian's legal battles with the National Collegiate Athletic Association were epic. 
 The program is only a shell of itself now, but it represents the continuing paradox of a semipro sports industry that constantly wrestles with its dual roles as an appendage of the university and the university's cash register. 
 On Saturday, U.N.L.V. was host to Wyoming in a crucial Mountain West Conference game. The Rebels are coached by Charlie Spoonhour, one of the deans of his profession and the seventh coach, including three interim replacements, since Tarkanian's stormy departure in 1992. Wyoming is coached by Steve McClain in his first Division I head-coaching job. 
The gap between Spoonhour, 63, and McClain, 40, is wide, but there is a point where their interests intersect.
There was a time in their careers when all the talk would have been about which lucky college program would be the beneficiary of a player like LeBron James, the 18-year-old high school phenom from Ohio. The conjecture would have been about which of the traditional giants -- say, Duke, North Carolina, Georgetown, Ohio State -- would get him.
But coaches, players and the news media talk about James as if he is the star of his own reality TV show. Much of the talk on Saturday centered on James's being declared ineligible for the rest of the season by the Ohio High School Athletic Association. His sin: he took two jerseys as gifts.
Spoonhour blamed the adults who offered the shirts in the first place. "Obviously, the kid made a mistake," he said, "but the adults being in the sporting goods business had to have some comprehension that what they were doing was wrong."
McClain said he felt bad for James. "You're telling me no kid has ever been given a jersey in a store?" McClain said. "He's the only kid that's ever happened to? He's being pulled out and singled out." 
Nearly every big-time high school recruit is probably getting something -- shoes, apparel, a meal here, a meal there. "This goes on all the time," Jason Straight, Wyoming's sophomore guard, said.
Straight, who is from Dunbar High School in Chicago, knows James and is also close to Tyson Chandler and Eddy Curry of the Chicago Bulls. He played with Curry on an Amateur Athletic Union team in 2000, when Curry was a high school senior. Chandler and Curry went straight to the N.B.A. from high school.
"In Eddy's group you had Kwame Brown, Tyson Chandler and a couple other high school studs," Straight said. "With LeBron, it's just LeBron; he's the No. 1 player in the country and he sticks out. There ain't nobody else who's going to be a top-five pick."
Spoonhour represents the slow, steady process that most of us were raised to respect. He was a high school coach beginning in 1961, then a college assistant and a junior college head coach. He began his head-coaching career at a four-year college in 1983 at Southwest Missouri State and built a reputation for doing a lot with a little. He coached at St. Louis from 1992 to 1999. He retired but came back to U.N.L.V. in 2001.
Spoonhour coached Larry Hughes at St. Louis. Hughes was all set to return for his sophomore season until he learned how high he would go in the N.B.A. draft. (He was eventually taken eighth over all.) Spoonhour couldn't tell him not to leave early.
The larger question is why LeBron James and other high school stars have struck such a nerve in recent years. For years young tennis players, baseball players and hockey players have gone from high school to professional careers. Why has this trend in basketball drawn so much attention?
There are a few reasons.
*The appearance of ambivalence toward education.
*An acute focus on the here and now.
*The fact that so many young African-American men have exploited the system and enjoyed wealth in a way that would never have been possible otherwise.
When Spoonhour began his college coaching career in 1968 and McClain began his in 1982, players were shackled to a system. You played high school basketball; if you were a great player, you sat back and waited for colleges to come in droves and recruit you. If you were an above-average-to-average player, you went where you could. You played three or four years of college and hoped to get drafted.
That order has been changed and challenged by players like James, who look at the system and reach conclusions that many of us find disturbing.
What troubles us is that when we look in the mirror we see LeBron James. Forget his race; forget his age. What disturbs an older generation is the clarity with which James and his generation have sized us up. For all of our lectures about getting an education, James's generation sees thousands upon thousands of unemployed workers, many with advanced degrees. They see workers who stay in one place for 25 to 30 years only to be downsized out of jobs.
"Everybody says a college education is a great thing -- it is, I have one," McClain said. "But that young man at 18 years old can make more money than I'll ever make."
LeBron James is not the end but the continuation of an evolution. Talented eighth-grade players are receiving mail from college coaches.
"They're already talking about two eighth graders wanting to go pro," McClain said. "We might all be the greatest evaluators in the country, but I'm not sure you can tell when a kid's an eighth grader that he's going to be able to play at Wyoming or Vegas. But yet, what have we done? We've started sending them mail."
There will be no reform in the system, and Spoonhour knows it. "I don't think there's anything you can do about it," he said. "There's not going to be a rule that says LeBron James has to go to school."
McClain is part of a cluster of coaches who will have to contend with a coming generation of LeBron Jameses. "We're as guilty as anybody because we've created little monsters," McClain said. "You can't create them and then go 'Well, it's wrong.' We created it, now we're going to have to live with it."

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: THE PRESIDENT; 
Powell Set to Appear at U.N. This Week as Scheduled

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
White House officials said today that the space shuttle disaster would not slow or alter President Bush's plans to confront Iraq and that Secretary of State Colin L. Powell would appear as scheduled before the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday to make the case for quick action to disarm Saddam Hussein.
 "The president views this as a tragedy that has touched the lives of the American people and as a reminder of the risks of space flight," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. "The president does not see it as connected to other events around the world." 
 Mr. Fleischer said the loss of the shuttle "does not have any impact or change on any of the president's responsibilities to keep the peace and protect American people from dangers around the world." 
Administration officials said Mr. Bush would go to Houston on Tuesday for a memorial service for the seven astronauts who were killed when the shuttle broke up on re-entry on Saturday morning. 
The officials said Mr. Bush was mindful of the emotional toll on the nation from the images of the shuttle tearing into pieces. But they said it would not deter him from doing what he believed necessary to deal with the threat posed by Mr. Hussein. And, they said, the president was confident that the nation could cope simultaneously with the possibility of war and a wrenching but apparently unrelated tragedy.
"We have responsibilities and the president has an obligation to protect the American people, and those responsibilities continue despite the tragedy all America has faced," said Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director.
Still, the loss of the shuttle dominated Mr. Bush's agenda today. It was the subject of the sermon he heard this morning at St. John's Episcopal Church, across Lafayette Park from the White House. It was the main topic of phone conversations he held with foreign leaders, including President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee of India and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain, a strong ally of Mr. Bush in taking a hard line against Iraq. 
The White House situation room, more typically in recent months the site of intensive meetings about terrorism and the prospect of war with Iraq, was largely given over today to coordinating the White House's response to the shuttle accident.
Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, updated Mr. Bush periodically about the efforts to find the cause of the accident.
The White House also continued to monitor the continuing diplomatic maneuvering about Iraq as well. 
Three days before Mr. Powell is set to present to the Security Council the administration's evidence that Mr. Hussein continues to stockpile weapons of mass destruction, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations reiterated that his country no longer had chemical or biological weapons. He added that Iraq would do its best to prove its assertion to United Nations weapons inspectors in the coming week.
"We are going to demonstrate whatever we have as evidence about all these remaining issues," the Iraqi ambassador, Mohammed Aldouri, told Fox News Sunday. "Iraq is clean."
In Baghdad, a senior Iraqi official, Maj. Gen. Hossam Mohammed Amin, told reporters that the evidence shown to the Security Council by Mr. Powell would probably be "fabricated space photos or aerial photos."
In London, Britain's defense secretary, Geoff Hoon, said he was confident that the Security Council would approve a new resolution authorizing the use of force against Iraq. Foreign ministers from nearly all of the 15 member nations of the Security Council have said they intend to be on hand for Mr. Powell's presentation. 
At least 11 of the Council's members signaled last week that they would like to give the weapons inspectors more time before considering whether to give their explicit backing to an invasion led by the United States. 
Mr. Bush said on Friday that the United States believed Security Council Resolution 1441 provided the authorization necessary to begin military action against Iraq and that the United States would not be held back by lack of a second resolution should it decide on war.
Asked about Mr. Bush's frame of mind regarding Iraq in the aftermath of the shuttle accident, Mr. Bartlett said the president had made clear in his State of the Union address last week that he believed the United States could handle whatever challenges were thrown at it, domestic and foreign.
"There are many developments that happen during a presidency and to our country at the same time," Mr. Bartlett said. "We as a country, and this administration, have shown that we are equal to the task of responding to these challenges with the necessary resolve and confidence."
Mr. Bartlett said the shuttle tragedy would not change Mr. Bush's view of how to deal with Iraq any more than it would change his economic policy. "They're not related," he said.
Attending church this morning, Mr. Bush heard a sermon by the Rev. Luis Leon, who said that for many people the loss of the shuttle felt like "more than we can stomach." 
Father Leon referred to reports that some Iraqis had called the shuttle's loss God's way of getting back at the United States. He called such sentiments "hokum" and "garbage" and said the pain of accident was the price the nation paid for pushing the boundaries of knowledge. Mr. Bush made no public remarks.

HEADLINE: Korea Is Trying to Mend Fences 

BYLINE:  ByDON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
For Jeffrey D. Jones, a possible role as an adviser on foreign business to Roh Moo Hyun after Mr. Roh's inauguration as president on Feb. 25 offers no risk of conflicting loyalties.
 "I'm always on the side of free enterprise," Mr. Jones, a former president of the American Chamber of Commerce here, said today. "I'll always take a win-win situation." 
 The fact that the Roh transition team may be considering offering him a post -- a widely drawn inference here after Mr. Jones dined with Mr. Roh and later with one of Mr. Roh's economic advisers -- underlines a major concern for the incoming Roh administration: keeping the confidence and goodwill of foreign investors and businesspeople at a time of surging anti-American sentiment here.
Mr. Roh himself has been part of the problem, foreign businesspeople here say, because of the way he sharply criticized the United States-Korean relationship before and during his election campaign. Many Koreans have also bridled at the Bush administration's handling of nuclear tensions with North Korea and at the growing likelihood of military action against Iraq.
The result has been anti-American demonstrations, a spectacle that makes investors recoil. "Korea has been a world-class place to invest in," said Martin Pichinson, chief executive of Sherwood Partners, a consulting firm in Los Angeles and San Francisco. "They've recently destroyed it. You have a new leader speaking against the United States."
Since his election, Mr. Roh and his advisers have been trying to tone down their comments and have reached out to people like Mr. Jones to calm the waters. Mr. Roh "is interested in how foreign businesspeople feel about Korea," Mr. Jones said. "He wants to do the right thing for the economy. He thinks it's important for the government to continue attracting foreign investment."
While Mr. Roh may make headway with foreign businesspeople in Seoul, Mr. Pichinson said, it is less clear whether distant investors with little firsthand knowledge of the country will take much comfort from Mr. Roh's change of tack. "Korea has created an unstable zone," he said, and for now, he said, his advice to investors is to "do nothing" in the country.
Others are evidently adopting the same stance. Mr. Jones acknowledged that there had been "a drop in the number of people who want to come to Korea and see what's going on."
The decline is difficult to quantify, though new foreign direct investment in plants, factories and land offers some guidance. Such investment peaked at $15.7 billion in 2000, a year when a large number of struggling companies laid low by the 1997 financial crisis were finally sold or merged. The figure fell to $11.9 billion in 2001 and just $9.1 billion in 2002. 
"Burning U.S. flags and holding signs saying, 'Don't Attack Iraq' has given the impression that South Koreans are opposed to the war on terrorism," said Lee Shin Bom, a former conservative member of the National Assembly who recently returned from two years' research at the University of California at Irvine. "I am worried about the possible negative effect on U.S. investment."
Foreign executives are also concerned about a proliferation of regulations and about ingrained attitudes that make doing business here difficult under any circumstances.
Asked by a businessman whether South Korea would ever completely stop closing itself off, Mr. Roh said: "We have developed strong resistance in our national sentiment. We will try to open up to introduce advanced regulations."
William Oberlin, who succeeded Mr. Jones as president of the American Chamber of Commerce on Jan. 1, listed what he called major challenges in fields ranging from the import of pharmaceuticals and motor vehicles to battling labor and tax problems. Another top priority, he said, would be to develop a strategy for bringing about a bilateral investment treaty by the United States and South Korea.
The two countries have been talking about such a treaty for years, but according to Mr. Jones, the talks are snagged on a local-content quota for movie theaters that the South Korean film industry is desperate to retain.
Mr. Oberlin, president of Boeing Korea, and Mr. Jones, a partner at Kim & Chang, one of Seoul's most prestigious law firms, both attended a meeting in Hawaii last month of the Korea-U.S. Business Council, which discussed bilateral problems and concluded that South Korea needed to make itself "much friendlier to foreigners through deregulation, a fair competition system and adoption of global standards."
In addition to his pledges to reform the chaebol, the big conglomerates that have dominated Korean economic life for decades, and to address the complex regulatory system, Mr. Roh has sought to establish common cause with a foreign business community anxious for reassurances.
"You and the Korean people today are in the same boat named Korea, and are sailing to a common destiny," Mr. Roh told foreign business representatives and diplomats at a recent breakfast conference in Seoul. "I will try to be a good captain of the ship you are aboard, so that the passengers will be comfortable and will revisit the ship in the future as well."
But there is still the sense that South Koreans, who are often suspicious of foreign influence in the most tranquil of times, will now find more reasons to reject foreign influence and foreign products.
"A small contingent probably is anti-American," said Tami Overby, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce here. "It's Koreans expressing their desire for independence. Unfortunately, it's making people nervous."

HEADLINE: Some Deaths Resonate, Others Pass Unnoticed 

BYLINE:  By ERICA GOODE 

 BODY:
It was familiar. The silence from the sky, the sober faces of NASA officials, the presidential words of sympathy, the grimly upbeat relatives, uncles, sisters, mothers schooled to temper grief with an acceptance of risk. There would be funerals. An investigation. Speeches to Congress, lengthy reports.
It was familiar, and that was tragic -- "a heartbreaker," as one woman in San Francisco put it -- but it was also home ground, scripted territory mercifully free from the murky uncertainties of biological and nuclear threat, imminent combat, terrorists with bombs in their shoes. 
 Americans know how to mourn heroes lost in space. They have done it before. 
 It was familiar. But it was also different; different, for example, from the faceless deaths of people whose lives end on the highway, in bathtubs, in hospital beds, in the deserts of Afghanistan.
The astronauts' deaths were vivid, unexpected, the bearers of symbolic weight. They represented, said Dr. Daniel Gilbert, a psychologist at Harvard, something greater than the simple loss of life. They were personal, involving, in the language of researchers who study death's effects on the public, "identified" rather than "statistical" victims.
Familiarity and difference shape human perception. They determine what is attended to and what is ignored, what stirs us and what leaves us indifferent, what comforts us and what makes us afraid.
At the most basic cellular level, the human organism is hard-wired to respond to change and to habituate to what is repetitive or continuing.
The eye notices movement, the ear an alteration in volume, the nose an unfamiliar odor. Dripping faucets, persistent smells, static scenes fade into the background.
This capacity to adapt, experts say, means that, after a while, it is possible to forget that, 170 miles above the ground, seven people are hurtling through space in the equivalent of a souped-up tin can.
Shuttles go up and come down.
"You don't remember the launch, you don't know who's on it and for the most part, people are definitely not thinking about its return," said Karen Brown Dunlap, the dean and president-elect of the Poynter Institute for media studies in St. Petersburg, Fla.
Or, as President Bush put it, "In an age when spaceflight has come to seem almost routine, it is easy to overlook the dangers of travel by rocket."
Adaptation also explains why neither the power of a liftoff to awe nor an explosion to shock will ever again be as intense as in earlier decades. Why, mingled with sadness and loss, there is a sense that we know what this is about and that it may, in some way, be preferable to disasters we have not yet experienced and know little of. "The first time the shuttle blows up, part of our reaction is, 'I had no idea this could happen,' " Dr. Gilbert said. "The second time it doesn't draw quite the same response."
In his 1997 book, "Into Thin Air," Jon Krakauer describes a similar acclimatization to the sight of long-dead human bodies on Mount Everest. "The first body had left me badly shaken for several hours," Mr. Krakauer wrote. "The shock of encountering the second wore off almost immediately."
Yet if familiarity modulated the public's response, difference ensured that that response was substantial.
How people judge the significance of a death depends on its context, said Dr. George Loewenstein, a professor of psychology and economics at Carnegie Mellon University.
The point of reference is important.
Tell people that seven Americans died on the highway in a single evening -- or that 50,000 die that way each year -- and it will barely register. Tell them that seven teenagers died in a single car on a specific road and they will gather at memorial services, give money, write letters to city officials.
"We care as much about proportions as we do about absolute numbers," Dr. Loewenstein said.
Few go into space. Fewer still die there.
Death that comes unexpectedly, that occurs in startling circumstances, that claims people with names we recognize, receives more notice. Loss means more when it is has a name.
Humans evolved to interact in small groups, to mourn their relatives and neighbors on the Saharan plain, not the abstract victims of heart disease or the people who perished in a massacre thousands of miles away.
Research subjects, invited to share the profits of a coin toss with contestants who incorrectly called heads or tails, give away more when the loser who will benefit is identified, even if only by a number, than when the loser remains anonymous, Dr. Loewenstein and his colleagues have found.
Charities count on this unconscious emotional bond: people are less likely to save children as a group than they are to save a particular child.
Yet emotions, developed to enhance the species' survival, keeping early humans one step in front of hungry lions, sometimes mislead in the modern world, Dr. Loewenstein argues.
Reason dictates that statistics matter, that the deaths of tens of thousands merit more attention -- and more resources -- than the deaths of a few.
But to reach this conclusion requires a certain detachment, a cool evaluation after a gut-level response.
In the era of the sound bite and the human interest story, of endless airtime waiting to be filled, that assessment often does not take place.
Symbols compel a response, while substance is frequently ignored. Sympathy flows to those portrayed as the saddest, the bravest, the most beloved. The masses, though their need may be larger, fend for themselves.
"Our emotional reactions to events are badly mistuned," Dr. Loewenstein said.
Still, rationality is unlikely ever to replace symbolic heft. Tragedy will never be defined solely by number.
Perhaps that is not all bad. 
"When somebody dies in a bathtub accident, it is the loss of a human being, but not the loss of something symbolically very important to us," Dr. Gilbert said. "Astronauts symbolize to us everything that's good and noble in ourselves and our aspirations and our nation. Can the loss of seven astronauts be equated to the loss of seven other people?"
His answer, and that of millions of Americans on Saturday, was, "Not really."

HEADLINE: FASHION WEEK PREVIEW; 
Fashion Has a Story, And Plans to Shout It

BYLINE:  By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
An analyst for Bear Stearns, say, making his way home to Cos Cob or Scarsdale through Grand Central Terminal any night next week, might find his thoughts temporarily digressing from the solemn news surrounding fourth-quarter earnings. Distraction will come from images of young women blown up to many times their already Brobdingnagian size.Vogue magazine will install a giant screen in Vanderbilt Hall for the duration of Fashion Week, to deliver continual runway footage from the fall 2003 shows in Bryant Park to the 500,000 commuters every day. 
 "This is about taking the fashion industry to the people," Vogue's publisher, Thomas A. Florio, said. "The models will look as though they are walking through the logo of Vogue." 
 Although little on the world stage might suggest that the mass appetite for style news is growing, the monthlong collections that begin with the New York shows on Friday are the focus of unusually aggressive media attention.
Besides Vogue's Grand Central project, the magazine is producing five one-hour specials drawing from runway news, which will be shown over the coming months on syndicated television. In conjunction with Fashion Week, 600,000 of Time magazine's most affluent subscribers will receive a special style and design supplement along with the newsweekly next Monday. The special issue will be distributed twice a year; the first features Heidi Klum on the cover. 
The motive behind Time's venture is to attract more luxury-goods advertisers to the weekly, Taylor Gray, an associate publisher, said. "Obviously the environment for this isn't as good as it was two years ago," Mr. Gray said, "but the hope is to develop relationships with these advertisers and lay the groundwork for when times are better."
Meanwhile, the Metro Channel's popular "Full Frontal Fashion" series, which already features saturation coverage of the New York shows, will travel for the first time to Milan and Paris for the European collections. Beginning in April, "Full Frontal Fashion" will expand beyond its New York City base to become a weekly program on the WE cable channel, with Ali Landry as host, which reaches 50 million viewers. 
WE has made a weekly commitment to style coverage, the network's president, Martin von Ruden, said, "because companies like Revlon and L'Oreal expressed specific interest in fashion coverage on WE."
Perhaps in a sour economy, purveyors of clothes, beauty products and other comparative frivolities find they need to advertise more assertively, rather than less so. 
Finally, as the ultimate captive audience for fashion and beauty marketers, the industry professionals attending the collections will find themselves besieged by even more coverage. The Time supplement will be distributed at Bryant Park, along with a gossip-filled daily magazine produced for showgoers by Us magazine, which made a successful debut last fall during the spring collections. Buyers and editors will also receive another publication, The Daily, produced by Seventh on Sixth, the official presenters of the New York shows.
Fern Mallis, director of Seventh on Sixth, said The Daily had little trouble finding advertisers. The paper will appear six times during Fashion Week with 101 pages of advertising from companies like Conde Nast, Redkin, Avon and Sony, she said. 
"We've got thousands of people sitting and waiting for shows to start for 20 minutes to an hour with nothing," Ms. Mallis added. "We can give them something to do. This industry has a million stories."

HEADLINE: FASHION WEEK PREVIEW; 
Catwalks in Search of a Rebel

BYLINE:  By GUY TREBAY 

 BODY:
The Jacobs one typically finds on the fashion pages is Marc and not Jane. But if ever there were a moment to invoke the celebrated urban theorist out of her usual context, this is the time. Old buildings need new uses, Ms. Jacobs once observed in her classic "Death and Life of Great American Cities." The sentiment has a certain aptness as the creaking global house of fashion prepares this Friday to begin a monthlong open-house during fashion weeks in New York, London, Paris and Milan. 
 Fashion has been troubled for some time and for a variety of reasons. These include the economy (consumer confidence recently fell to a nine-year low in a survey by the Conference Board); an aging population of brand-name designers; the rarely remarked failure of American fashion schools to field effective farm teams or introduce new design stars; and the reality that fewer corporations control more brands. 
 There is another factor. Fashion may have been hurt by its own success. Credibility is no easier to measure in fashion than hip-hop, but it's a commodity crucial to each. Whether one talks in terms of tipping points, the anatomy of buzz or the network of mysterious "influentials" who motivate culture (and who are the subject of a new book of that name by Ed Keller and Jon Berry), it is clear that a growing sense exists in the industry that fashion may have lost some of its essence -- loopiness, daring, whimsy, frivolity, experimentation and an affection for risk -- by venturing so deeply into the mainstream. 
This is not just a matter of young and independent designers feeling, as Marylou Luther, a consultant to the Fashion Group International, recently said, "shut out, burned out" or afraid of being fed alive to corporate machines. It is that, by the time automobile manufacturers start franchising fashion weeks in Bangkok and New Delhi, or record labels start marketing import compilations titled Fashion Week, or "Full Frontal Fashion" goes international, a certain alienation sets in at the grass roots.
"When was the last time anyone saw wit in fashion?" Ms. Luther asked recently. The question is easily answered: February 2000, when Miguel Adrover sent scraps of Quentin Crisp's mattress onto the runway in the form of a ladylike coat. 
Yet it could be that those developments will prove good, by providing a backdrop of staid institutions -- the old structures of Ms. Jacobs's formulation -- against which a nascent fashion counterculture can react. 
"We're coming out of a period of too much luxury," said Norma Kamali, a designer who has maintained a wary relationship with the mainstream throughout her 34-year career. "There was too much of everything, and now a lot of that is going to fall away and be devastated by the economy and probably by a war. It's a very hard time for the industry, of course, but it's also a perfect time for new designers to come in."
Tyros will be be well represented during New York's Fashion Week, with showings by media darlings like Zac Posen, 22, and Esteban Cortazar, 20; by Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, both 24, of Proenza Schouler; by Thomas Vasseur, 28, and Gaba Esquivel, 29, of Vasseur Esquivel; and by Richie Rich and Traver Rains, the former club kids whose Heatherette, after three seasons, is practically the establishment. 
"Everything in the business is about branding yourself," Mr. Rich said last week at a silver-walled East Village studio where the transgendered model Amanda Lepore sipped coffee as a cutter prepared dress patterns for Ms. Lepore to wear in a show that takes its inspiration from the 1978 cinematic gold mine, "Eyes of Laura Mars." "I don't want to have to worry about the future of fashion," Mr. Rich added. "I'm more interested in being free, pushing it, creating nonsense but in a structured way."
Youth, of course, is no valid criterion for assessing value. The surprises of the coming week may arise from seasoned designers hidden in plain sight. "There is a lot of pressure to find a brand new really young exciting designer and build them up," said Mary Gehlhar, the fashion director for Gen Art, the nonprofit organization founded 10 years ago to showcase new talents in the arts. "Just throwing someone in the spotlight isn't what will make them last." 
Among the names often cited as potential comers by those knowledgeable about the industry -- Liz Collins, Alice Roi, Maria Cornejo, Alvin Valley, Jess Holzworth, Benjamin Cho, Daphne Gutierrez and Nicole Noselli of Bruce, Hanii Yoon and Gene Kang of Y & Kei -- most barely register except to the fashion adept. This may be a good thing.
"We always used to feel we had to go to Europe for wonderful new designs," said Beth Buccini, the owner with Sarah Easley, of Kirna Zabete, the adventurous SoHo retailer. "Now, in the past couple seasons, we've been feeling sincerely that there's a lot of homegrown talent around." 
Fashion Week may demonstrate how tough times work with Darwinian efficiency, culling the herd and changing the overall landscape, as new designers edge back into those retail spaces they could never afford when the economy was fat. "We've all read the stories," Ms. Buccini said. "We've watched Miguel Adrover and what he went through. Designers don't commit now unless they feel they've got it all. In a climate like this, you've got to really want it bad."

HEADLINE: Gun Industry Ex-Official Describes Bond of Silence 

BYLINE:  By FOX BUTTERFIELD 

 BODY:
In the first case of a gun industry whistle-blower, a former senior firearms industry executive said in an affidavit filed in court in San Diego yesterday that gun manufacturers had long known that some of their dealers corruptly sold guns to criminals but pressured one another into remaining silent for fear of legal liability.
 The affidavit, by Robert A. Ricker, a former chief lobbyist and executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council, then the main gun industry trade organization, was filed in California Superior Court in support of claims by 12 California cities and counties suing the gun makers and their wholesalers and retail dealers. 
 The cities, led by Los Angeles and San Francisco, contend that the gun industry has maintained a distribution system that allows many guns to fall into the hands of criminals and juveniles, creating a public nuisance and violating a California law on unfair business practices. 
A copy of Mr. Ricker's declaration, filed under seal, was made available to The New York Times. 
Mr. Ricker, a moderate in an industry dominated by hard-liners, lost his post as executive director of the American Shooting Sports Council in 1999 after attending a White House meeting with President Bill Clinton to discuss preventing more school shootings like the one at Columbine High School in Colorado.
The meeting was opposed by the National Rifle Association, and Mr. Ricker said in his affidavit that pressure from the rifle association led the gun industry to disband his organization in favor of the more conservative National Shooting Sports Foundation.
Several lawyers for the gun companies, including Lawrence G. Keane, general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, now the main gun industry trade group, said they had not yet seen Mr. Ricker's affidavit and therefore could not comment. 
In their defense, the gun makers have insisted they do not know what happens to their guns after they leave the factory, since they are sold to wholesalers and in turn to retail dealers.
But Mr. Ricker, who has been working for more than two decades in the gun industry, including a stint as a lawyer for the N.R.A., said the gun makers had long known that "the diversion of firearms from legal channels of commerce to the black market" takes place "principally at the distributor/dealer level."
"Corrupt dealers" make it easy for criminals and juveniles to buy guns, Mr. Ricker said, by allowing practices like "straw sales," in which an individual buys a gun on behalf of someone who is prohibited from purchasing a gun because of a criminal conviction or his age. 
"Leaders in the industry have long known that greater industry action to prevent illegal transactions is possible," Mr. Ricker said, particularly through a network of manufacturers' representatives who stay in close touch with dealers. But industry officials have "resisted taking constructive voluntary action," he said, and have "sought to silence others within the industry." 
This has resulted in a "see-no-evil, hear-no-evil approach," Mr. Ricker said, and encouraged "a culture of evasion of firearms laws and regulations."
The gun makers became sufficiently concerned about their potential liability, Mr. Ricker said, that they convened annual meetings from 1992 through 1997, which he attended. A major subject was whether it would be good to take voluntary action to better control the distribution of guns. 
But, Mr. Ricker said, "the prevailing view was that if the industry took action voluntarily, it would be an admission of responsibility for the problem." Eventually, some of the lawyers decided that even holding the meetings was "dangerous" and they were stopped, Mr. Ricker said.
Dennis A. Henigan, legal director for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said of Mr. Ricker's affidavit, "The consummate insider has now exposed the dirty little secret of the gun industry -- that is, the underground market is supplied by corrupt gun dealers, and the industry punishes anyone who tries to stop it."
Mr. Henigan is a co-counsel in the lawsuit by the California cities, which also include Oakland, Sacramento and Los Angeles County. 
In a telephone interview from his home in suburban Washington, Mr. Ricker said he had recently served as an expert witness for the gun industry in a related lawsuit, brought by Cincinnati. He said he also still served as a consultant to some gun companies. 
But Mr. Ricker said someone in the gun industry needed to speak up about bad dealers because "we've got a bunch of right-wing wackos at the N.R.A. controlling everything."
Left to their own, Mr. Ricker said, many industry executives "would be more than willing to sit down and negotiate a settlement" with the cities about weeding out unscrupulous dealers.
In his affidavit, Mr. Ricker also appeared to undercut another of the gun makers' most common defenses: that because they only sell to federally licensed dealers, they are fully obeying the law and the rest of the job of enforcing the law can be handled by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
Mr. Ricker said in the affidavit that the idea that all dealers operate legally because they have a license is a "fiction." He added that "the firearms industry has long known that A.T.F. is hampered" by its shortage of personnel and loopholes in the gun laws. For example, he said, the bureau can inspect a dealer only once a year as a result of a law supported by the rifle association.

HEADLINE: Richard C. Lee, 86, Mayor Who Revitalized New Haven 

BYLINE:  By PAUL von ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Richard C. Lee, the former mayor of New Haven whose urban renewal programs in the 1950's and 1960's earned national recognition and created a template for decades of future city revitalization projects, died on Sunday. He was 86.
 Mr. Lee had suffered from diabetes and heart disease and was living most recently in a continuing care center near here. 
 Mr. Lee, whose formal schooling ended when he graduated from Hillhouse High School in New Haven in 1934, was an intuitive, street-smart politician with a keen eye for public relations. He became the driving force behind many of the city's largest building projects.
As mayor from 1954 to 1970, Mr. Lee, a Democrat, leveraged hundreds of millions of dollars from the state and federal governments to raze blighted city neighborhoods, feats documented in national magazines and newspapers.
Under his leadership, a shopping center and a sports and music coliseum were built downtown, and a path was cleared for the construction of the Interstate highways that put his city at the crossroads of southern New England. 
"More than any American mayor in that era, he made the best possible use of the federal and state laws that were then available for rebuilding a center city and improving the lives of its people," said Joel Cogen, executive director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, an organization that Mr. Lee founded in 1966. 
"He had the vision to see that there were many things that the cities and towns could do better together than they could do separately," Mr. Cogen added. "He had the leadership skills to bring them together and make it happen."
Richard Charles Lee was born on March, 12, 1916. He grew up in a cold-water apartment in the working-class Newhallville neighborhood. His father, Frederick, worked at the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.
After high school, Mr. Lee took a job as a reporter with The New Haven Journal-Courier after bluffing his way through an interview.
"The newspaper editor asked Lee if he could type," said Raymond Wolfinger, a political science professor at the University of California at Berkeley who spent a year working at City Hall near Mayor Lee in 1957 and 1958. "He said yes, which was a complete lie. But that was a Friday, and between Friday and Monday he borrowed a typewriter and taught himself typing."
At 21 he became a member of the Democratic Party. Soon he was elected an alderman and helped draft the first budget for the city's Planning Commission. After winning three more terms and, in 1943, after a medical discharge from the Army because of ulcers, Mr. Lee was hired by Yale University, first to handle its wartime news digest and later to head its public relations bureau. It was there that he learned to connect with people from every walk of life.
"Dick was always perfectly comfortable with people who had greater educations than he," said Robert A. Dahl, a Sterling professor of political science emeritus at Yale and author of a 1963 book, "Who Governs? Democracy and Power in the American City," which documented the changes Mr. Lee was making in New Haven. "You never felt that he was manipulating you. He was, probably, but he was always listening."
Mr. Lee is survived by his wife, Ellen Griffin Lee; two daughters, Sarah A. Lee and Tara Lee Croke; and a son, David Lee.
After two failed mayoral campaigns -- the second of which he lost by two votes -- Mr. Lee beat the Republican mayor in 1954 and kept the job for 16 years, still a New Haven record. But New Haven was a city that was losing its industrial job base and whose inner city was expanding because of an influx of Southern blacks. 
One of his first actions was to convene a committee of residents to come up with ways to reinvent New Haven, a northeastern city that despite Mr. Lee's emphasis on redevelopment has continued to struggle with more than its share of poverty and unemployment. 
"We are taking the town out of the 18th century and projecting it into the 21st," he once told his constituents. And if Mayor Lee was anything, his friends said, he was a pragmatist who knew who to get to know and how to get things done. 
In 1957, John F. Kennedy, then in the Senate, traveled to New Haven to campaign for Mr. Lee. To shore up New Haven's large Italian electorate, the mayor brought in Rocky Marciano, the boxer. He won that election by a two-to-one margin.
By the end of the 1950's, New Haven was receiving far more federal aid per capita than any other city in in the county, Professor Wolfinger said.

HEADLINE: 'A Sea of Fire,' or Worse? 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The North Korean nuclear crisis is far more perilous than many people realize.
 The White House, wanting to keep the focus on Iraq, did not even bother to tell us that satellite images show North Korea apparently taking steps toward reprocessing plutonium. It was left to my Times colleague David (Scoop) Sanger to alert the public a few days ago. 
 Can you imagine if it were Iraq that had been spotted moving nuclear fuel around? The news that the Pentagon is reinforcing its preparedness on the Korean Peninsula suggests that it doesn't believe the White House lullabies either. 
When North Korea has reprocessed its plutonium and built five more nuclear weapons, probably by summer, it'll try to pressure us into a new package deal. To understand how dangerous the Korean Peninsula could become, consider one worst-case scenario:
Feb. 14: The C.I.A. confirms that North Korea is reprocessing plutonium, making a pre-emptive U.S. military strike more difficult because of the risk of radiation leakage.
Feb. 15: "This is not a crisis," the White House declares.
March 17: North Korea announces that it will resume missile tests. Stocks plunge in Tokyo and Seoul.
March 26: North Korea test-fires a two-stage Taepodong 2 missile. It soars over Japan, knocking 9 percent off the Tokyo stock market. C.I.A. analysts warn that a three-stage version of the Taepodong 2 could reach the U.S. mainland. 
March 27: "This is not a major crisis," the White House declares.
April 7: On the birthday of the late Great Leader Kim Il Sung, North Korea resumes construction of a nuclear reactor in Taechon that will be capable of producing plutonium for 44 warheads annually.
May 1: The U.N. Security Council approves sanctions. Without Chinese enforcement they mean little.
June 29: North Korea completes reprocessing, and the plutonium is dispersed to be made into warheads.
July 10: North Korea tests a nuclear device. Stocks tumble worldwide, leading a big Japanese bank to the edge of bankruptcy.
July 12: North Korea formally declares itself a nuclear state, proudly asserting that the "Korean Bomb" will be used on behalf of all Koreans to combat Japanese and American aggressors. Stocks plunge worldwide, triggering a Japanese banking crisis and a global recession.
July 13: "This is not a monumental crisis," the White House says.
July 15: Tokyo's mayor, Shintaro Ishihara, launches a campaign for prime minister on a platform of building nuclear weapons.
July 20: With its plutonium safely hidden, North Korea begins to pressure the U.S. to negotiate a package solution to the crisis. Its troops spray machine-gun fire across the DMZ. South Korean and Japanese stock markets fall 7 percent.
Aug. 1: A sealed vial of anthrax is found in an Osaka subway car. No one is hurt, but some commentators suggest it is a message from North Korea to the U.S.: "You'd better talk tous." 
Aug. 5: Iranian and Libyan nuclear buyers are spotted shopping in Pyongyang.
Aug. 6: "We shouldn't exaggerate this crisis," the White House says. "As we've said from the beginning, we're always ready to sit down with North Korea and talk."
Aug. 13: Donald Rumsfeld offers three military options to President Bush. The minimal one calls for a cruise missile strike on North Korea's known nuclear facilities (but because the plutonium has been reprocessed and the warheads hidden, we cannot take out its nuclear arsenal). The maximal one also destroys the North's air defense system and much of its artillery.
Aug. 16: Intelligence intercepts suggest that North Korea will respond to even a minimal U.S. military strike by launching conventional missiles at Japan, and to a broader strike by turning Seoul into "a sea of fire." The C.I.A. warns that if the North finds itself losing a conventional war, it will use chemical, biological and possibly nuclear weapons against Japan and U.S. forces in South Korea. All sides brace for a new Korean war, which the C.I.A. estimates could kill one million people.
Aug. 17: Colin Powell is told by President Bush: "If only we'd listened to you two years ago about the need to engage North Korea! Even this February, if only we had started negotiations. I'm sorry, Colin, we blew it." Then Mr. Powell wakes up and realizes he was dreaming.

HEADLINE: Some Breaks in the Budget For Causes Small and Large 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
At a time of scarce dollars and widespread needs, Edie Mesick plowed through Gov. George E. Pataki's budget proposals last week, prepared to find little assistance for the anti-hunger group she runs and its nutrition program to help needy people get food stamps.
 To her surprise, Ms. Mesick found that Mr. Pataki not only spared her program but also doubled its support to $2 million this year. 
 "We're just plain thrilled," said Ms. Mesick, executive director of the Nutrition Consortium of New York State. "I certainly recognize that there are competing needs, so I don't take anything for granted."
The money for the nutrition program was just one of the unexpected allocations for causes large and small sprinkled throughout Mr. Pataki's three-volume budget last week. Overshadowed by his cuts in education and health care, they included proposals to expand nutrition and day care programs, buy more medicine for AIDS and H.I.V. patients, create tax breaks for high tech businesses and reward residents restoring historic homes in struggling areas.
Mr. Pataki also called for spending at least $80 million on housing and services for residents of adult homes for the mentally ill, as part of a larger effort to overhaul a long-neglected system that has come under recent criticism. 
Most of his proposals were modest in cost, amounting to mere pocket change in a $90.8 billion budget. But in a year when nearly everything else was being scaled back, the budget additions surprised no one more than the special interest groups who had lobbied for them.
"We went through the motions, but to tell you the truth, we didn't expect this to be the year," one longtime lobbyist confided. 
Gay rights advocates found themselves in the unusual position of hearing that they might get more money than they had requested. More than 40 groups had lobbied for a $20 million increase in a program that supplies medicine to AIDS and H.I.V. patients; Mr. Pataki proposed a $49.8 million increase. 
"I can't remember the last time this happened," Ronald Johnson, associate executive director of Gay Men's Health Crisis, said. "It's a bittersweet victory because there are some horrendous cuts in the budget."
The numbers in a governor's budget always provide a road map to his priorities for all to see. In Mr. Pataki's case, it is jobs and the economy, law enforcement and the environment, among other things. 
In less obvious ways, the decisions about who gets what in the budget -- and who is left out -- also reflect a myriad of political factors such as campaign promises, closed-door lobbying, and the opinions of influential aides, legislators and contributors.
"In good years and bad years, there's always good and bad in the budget," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a veteran of 28 state budgets. "It's bare-knuckled politics, that's what it is. There's a whole host of influences on the governor and his staff."
For instance, Mr. Pataki, who ran for re-election last fall, had more reason to care about AIDS financing this year after receiving a key endorsement from the Empire State Pride Agenda, the state's largest gay rights group. Joe Tarver, the group's spokesman, said it raised the issue of AIDS funds with Mr. Pataki in a 2001 meeting. "There was no direct commitment," he said, "but it's always been sort of a subtext."
Mr. Pataki also proposed an income tax credit of up to $50,000 for homeowners who fix up historic properties in distressed areas, after two dozen preservation groups pushed for it through an e-mail and letter-writing campaign last fall. They argued that renovations would mean money for local economies, tapping into one of the governor's favorite themes: economic development.
"This is not about giving money away to preservation, but about generating local economic recovery," said Daniel Mackay of the Preservation League of New York State.
Similarly, the governor proposed tax incentives for small companies that provide high-tech jobs to resuscitate the upstate economy.
In tough times, though, even political alliances may not offer protection. Mr. Pataki has benefited repeatedly from the support of a powerful coalition of health care workers and hospitals led by Dennis Rivera, the president of the 1199/S.E.I.U. union. In 2000 and again last year, Mr. Pataki and the Legislature adopted health care programs that included government subsidies for the health care industry and salary increases for workers. 
This year, Mr. Pataki's budget, while preserving the salary increases, calls for cutting Medicaid funds by more than $1 billion and reinstating an assessment on hospital revenues and home care services. A spokeswoman for Mr. Rivera said the industry would be devastated.
The governor's budget decisions may also reflect more personal interests. Mr. Pataki, an avid outdoorsman, spared environmental programs from drastic cutbacks, even as he proposed a $2.25 fee on new tire purchases, which would raise about $44 million a year for cleaning tire dumps and a tire recycling program. 
Brian Nickerson, director of the Michaelian Institute of Public Policy at Pace University, said that new money for programs -- no matter how small -- can effectively carve out pockets of good will for Mr. Pataki in a difficult year.
"It's actually a really good public relations strategy," he said. "It makes the governor look like a champion if he's able to give even small increments to special areas in times of doom and gloom."
Others said the governor's budget created a system of winners and losers dictated by politics rather than policy.
"When you find these tiny bits of good news, it's not because anyone's made a principled decision to help the aged or infirm," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky. "It's because somebody has a politically powerful protector."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Doctors Hold Back Services In Insurance Protest 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
The doctor was out for patients all across New Jersey today as thousands of physicians stayed away from their offices and hospitals to protest what they consider to be ruinous increases in malpractice insurance rates.
 What had been planned as a one- or two-day protest threatened to stretch on, as organizers of the effort -- the largest of several job actions undertaken by doctors around the country in the past year -- urged physicians to keep refusing to provide most nonemergency care until state officials met their demands for limits on jury awards. 
 "We will continue to see emergency cases, we will continue to do deliveries of pregnant women," said Dr. Robert Rigolosi, president of the Medical Society of New Jersey, "but elective cases will not be seen, routine office visits will not be done, routine mammographies will not be done. They will not be done until we can get some meaningful tort reforms." 
Dr. Rigolosi estimated that 70 percent of the state's 22,000 physicians took part. The doctors sought to keep the tone of their protest muted, out of respect for the space shuttle astronauts, but its message of defiance was as clear as the sign carried by a doctor at Christ Hospital in Jersey City: "When your water breaks, call your lawyer."
Doctors managed to respond to emergencies and see seriously ill patients as well as attend rallies at hospitals around the state, where they heard sympathetic legislators promise action on their demand for a limit of $250,000 on pain and suffering awards in malpractice cases. The doctors say they do not want limits on reimbursement for economic losses -- compensation for lost future earnings, essentially -- that result from a doctor's actions.
Today's rallies were a prelude to a march on the State House on Tuesday morning, just two hours before Gov. James E. McGreevey is to deliver his annual budget address. There, organizers said, thousands of doctors will continue their attacks on Mr. McGreevey and other Democrats for refusing to support their legislation, and to hear from doctors from other states, who, Dr. Rigolosi said, will warn them against ending their job action too soon.
There have been similar, limited walkouts in a number of states, including West Virginia, Florida and Nevada. 
The doctors say that sharp increases in malpractice insurance premiums result from excessive jury awards for the pain and suffering claims of patients. The trial lawyers who bring those suits say the increases are a result of insurance companies' efforts to make up their investment losses in the financial markets.
One of the day's largest rallies was at the Shore Medical Center in Neptune, where 800 people, mostly doctors in green surgical garb or white lab coats, denounced the trial lawyers and heard stories of doctors being forced to leave the state in search of lower premiums. Several hundred doctors also rallied at St. Francis Medical Center here in Trenton, where Assemblyman Eric Munoz, a surgeon, said, "If we don't get tort reform now -- well, this is politics, and we'll play politics."
Although several of the day's demonstrations were boisterous -- the police had to separate doctors and a malpractice lawyer in front of the Jersey City courthouse this morning -- medical society leaders said they wanted to keep the events low-key out of respect for the Columbia disaster. In several cities, prayers replaced angry chanting, and many doctors in Bergen County lined up to donate blood after a rally at the Paramus community blood center.
"We had two colleagues on that shuttle, and the president said today was to be a day of mourning, so we wanted to tone it down a little, " said Dan Strechay, a spokesman for the medical society. "But tomorrow we'regoing to be in Trenton, and it's going to be political."
A check of several hospitals found a surge in emergency room admissions today -- as many as two or three times the normal number -- as patients who could not see their own doctors turned to the hospitals. The law requires a report from hospitals when essential emergency services are going unmet, and Dr. Clifton R. Lacy, commissioner of health and senior services, said that no hospital had done so by late afternoon. 
He warned doctors, however, that they could face disciplinary charges if they shirk their responsibilities to patients.
"The Board of Medical Examiners have told me that they take this very seriously, and so do I," Dr. Lacy said. "I believe that a work stoppage adds nothing productive and potentially creates problems of patient access to care."
Governor McGreevey's chief of staff, Jamie Fox, has been dismissive of the doctors. On a New Jersey Network news program on Sunday, he said: "On Monday, they'll be striking. On Tuesday, they're going to march on the State House. And on Wednesday, they're going to play golf."
The doctors recognize that they are attempting a complicated political calculus by trying to win the public to their cause and direct anger toward Trenton. Many doctors believe they can win a popularity contest with lawyers, but some also conceded today that they might anger their patients. 
"We are concerned that pushing hard risks a backlash," said Dr. Jack Tohme, president of the Valley Hospital medical staff in Ridgewood, "but there's no question our cause is just."
Joanna and Led Mendoza, who were waiting to see a doctor for Mrs. Mendoza's nausea and cough in the overcrowded emergency waiting room at Christ Hospital in Jersey City, had no sympathy for the doctors.
"She's in tremendous pain," Mr. Mendoza said. "They should feel the pain of what people are suffering."
Bruce H. Stern, president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of New Jersey, also criticized the doctors.
"They think this $250,000 cap for noneconomic damages is fair?" Mr. Stern said in an interview. "Will you tell me that $250,000 is all someone who was made blind is entitled to? Or the woman who had an unnecessary double mastectomy?"
Mr. Stern said the problem should be shifted to the insurers, by placing limits on their premiums.
Dr. Lacy, the health commissioner, said the doctors' focus on limiting certain jury awards was too narrow. He said the McGreevey administration favored having the state subsidize insurance premiums for the most heavily affected specialties, such as neurosurgery and obstetrics.

HEADLINE: January Auto Sales Fall 2% As Analysts See Tough Year 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Auto sales dropped 2 percent in January from a year earlier, carmakers reported today, signaling what many analysts say will be a tough year for the industry. Consumers are expected to benefit, though, from a wave of new products, particularly from foreign automakers like Nissan Motor, and cheaper prices because of the competition. 
 Ford sales were up 4 percent, while G.M. sales fell 2 percent and Chrysler sales fell 12 percent. Sales were also down sharply from December as Detroit and particularly General Motors stepped back from lavish end-of-the-year incentives. 
 Analysts said the numbers would have been worse had they not been propped up by sales to fleets, which are less profitable for automakers. One of the most popular vehicles last month was the Buick Century, a staple of rental car fleets; its sales rose 174 percent. 
Product plans disclosed by automakers in the last few days indicated that the industry was ranging widely in its efforts to lure customers.
Ford Motor executives said the company planned to produce fuel-efficient hybrid vehicles for several of its global brands this decade. Ford has already said it will sell a hybrid version of the Escape sport utility, but executives said the company might also build a hybrid Ford sedan and offer hybrid vehicles from the company's Volvo and Mazda units. 
General Motors, meanwhile, said that it would make a pickup version of its Hummer H2 sport utility next year. The company also surprised analysts by announcing that it had four new minivans in the works, though two are replacements of existing models. Minivans have been losing market share. 
Ford executives said the Escape hybrid would be available by the end of the year, as previously announced, but only to government or corporate fleet customers. The general public will have to wait until the middle of next year. Ford said it expected annual sales of 20,000 to 30,000 Escape hybrids. 
Hybrids supplement the internal combustion engine with electric power. While only 150,000 hybrid vehicles have been sold by Toyota Motor and Honda Motor since the late 1990's, they are increasingly figuring in the industry's product lineups. 
General Motors plans to enter the market in 2005 with a hybrid version of the Saturn Vue sport utility; Chrysler, a unit of DaimlerChrysler, plans to produce a small number of hybrid versions of its Dodge Ram pickup.
"Ford's decision signals that the race is on to be the industry leader in clean-car technology," said Daniel Becker, director of the Sierra Club's program on global warming and energy. 
Chris Theodore, vice president for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury product development, said the company had designed its Escape hybrid system to be easily adaptable to other models. 
"You can plug and play almost -- that's a bit of an exaggeration -- but you can transfer the basic module to other vehicles," he said. 
A hybrid car is not to be confused with the hydrogen cars that President Bush promoted as the automotive technology of the future in his State of the Union address. 
All of the major automakers are working on cars powered by hydrogen fuel cells, which generate electricity through chemical reactions, but they are considered to be years away from mass production. 
"Fuel cells, there is a time factor involved," said Prabhakar Patil, the chief engineer on Ford's Escape hybrid project. "In my estimation, mass production, 100,000 units or higher, is not going to happen for at least another 15 years. Hybrids are ready."
Mr. Patil added that the development of fuel-cell vehicles would be aided by production of hybrids, because both use electric drive systems. 
The Escape will operate much like the existing Toyota Prius. An electric motor will power the vehicle at low speeds, and the gas engine, generally, will take over at 20 miles per hour or more. The vehicle will also use a technology that traps energy used in braking. Ford says that it will get close to 40 miles per gallon in city driving, where the hybrid system is most effective. City mileage in current Escape models ranges from 18 to 23 m.p.g. 
Automakers reported that sales of sport utilities, pickups and minivans -- the crucial profit center for the auto industry -- were sluggish last month. 
Over all, Toyota sales fell 6 percent and Volkswagen sales fell 16 percent, while Honda sales rose 6 percent and Nissan was up 1 percent. 
"It was an O.K. month," said Paul Ballew, the chief industry sales analyst for G.M. "If it were to persist over a quarter, then I would become concerned."
Bill Hopkins, a G.M. dealer in Marianna, Fla., a rural area about 65 miles west of Tallahassee, said the balky economy and tensions in the Middle East had weighed on buyers. 
"It's the uncertainty of the times," he said. And, he added, it was cold last month -- as low as the single digits in his area. With that kind of cold in Florida, Mr. Hopkins said, "we can't function."

Liftoff Damage Is Focus Of Space Shuttle Inquiry
NASA investigators said that a piece of insulation that broke off from the shuttle's external fuel tank 80 seconds after liftoff was now a prime suspect in the series of failures that destroyed the shuttle Columbia 16 days later. A1

As early as 1997, a senior NASA engineer warned that hardened foam peeling away from the external fuel tank on the Columbia shuttle had caused "significant damage" to the ceramic tiles protecting the vehicle from re-entry temperatures. A1

Ronald D. Dittemore, manager of the space shuttle program, went to great lengths to emphasize his personal responsibility for the decisions made and the paths of action chosen since the Columbia's takeoff as he presided over his third press conference since the Columbia broke apart over Texas on Saturday morning.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: DOMESTIC DEFENSE; 
Ridge Says Request for Homeland Security Is Enough

BYLINE:  By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
The Bush administration said today that its first complete budget for the Department of Homeland Security, calling for a 7.4 percent increase in spending on domestic security programs, reflected its full support for the department. That assertion immediately came under attack from Congressional Democrats who said the new superagency was being dangerously underfinanced.
 The sharply different assessments of the adequacy of the department's $36.2 billion spending request suggested that the issue of domestic security spending could dominate budget negotiations this year in Congress and become a major issue in next year's presidential campaign. 
 "The president has requested a budget which reflects his continuing and very clear commitment to standing behind the priorities and the mission for the new department," said Tom Ridge, who was sworn in last month as the first secretary of homeland security. "We're building a foundation." 
But Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who has been designated by fellow Senate Democrats as a spokesman on domestic security, said in an interview that the budget was clearly inadequate and reflected the "quirky notion of the White House that you can improve homeland security without spending the dollars. It makes no sense."
The department went into business two weeks ago and will eventually consolidate 22 federal agencies, including the Customs Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Secret Service and the Border Patrol, and more than 170,000 employees.
The White House budget sharply increases spending on a handful of the agencies and programs that are being incorporated into the new department, especially the Coast Guard, which would receive an extra $600 million next year, much of it directed to overhaul the aging fleet.
Spending for programs labeled "information analysis and infrastructure protection," including the department's intelligence division, would more than triple, to $829 million next year.
But spending among agencies elsewhere in the department would increase far more modestly, and some domestic security programs face budget cuts in the new fiscal year. Overall spending for border and transportation security would drop by about 1.5 percent, to $18.1 billion, in part reflecting the one-time start-up costs this year of the Transportation Security Administration.
Budget specialists in and out of government say that the spending figures for domestic security programs -- and for the new department -- are difficult to analyze, since so many of the programs did not exist before the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and have been created within so many different agencies of the federal government.
But according to the figures released today by the White House, the budget for all domestic defense programs, including those within the Pentagon and the Department of Health and Human Services, would increase by about 10 percent next year, to $41.3 billion, a figure that includes the budget of the Homeland Security Department.
Several private analysts said that the budget requested by the White House reflected only a modest increase in spending on the domestic war on terrorism.
"It's largely flat," said Steven M. Kosiak of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. "To be fair to the administration, it's not clear that the kind of massive increases we had seen over the last couple of years would be necessary again next year, but it does raise concerns about whether there will have to be a trade-off between domestic security and other government priorities."
At a news conference today to discuss the spending request, Mr. Ridge acknowledged that the budget would not satisfy some Democratic lawmakers and other critics of the Bush administration who have called for a far larger budget for his agency.
But he suggested that a sharper increase next year would not necessarily improve the department's performance, especially not in the first months of the its existence.
"We have to be very, very focused on outcomes," Mr. Ridge said. "Some people in this town might think you construct a 10-story building by starting on the 10th floor. This is a long, difficult, challenging process. We're building a foundation, and this budget gives us a chance to move up and do just that."
In a study released last month by the Brookings Institution, a panel that included members of the Clinton administration recommended a total domestic security budget of $45 billion next year, almost $4 billion more than the Bush administration.
Mr. Schumer said an initial Democratic analysis of the White House budget showed that the administration was engaged in accounting gimmickry, and that spending for some crucial domestic security programs was actually being cut.
He said the Democratic analysis showed that, with inflation factored in, spending on customs and border protection would increase by only $52 million next year, a 1 percent increase. "There's almost a schizophrenia," he said. "This White House will spend almost anything we need to support the war on terrorism overseas, but they will actually spend fewer dollars than last year on homeland security."
Mr. Schumer said that he believed that the domestic security budget would be "one of the two or three major issues on the Hill this year" and would be seized on by Democrats who are seeking the party's presidential nomination next year.
Several of the early Democratic candidates for the White House, including Senators Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and John Edwards of North Carolina, have repeatedly accused the Bush administration of failing to devote enough money to domestic security programs.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Feb. 4 about an appearance by President Bush at the National Institutes of Health Vaccine Research Center in Bethesda, Md., gave an erroneous identification from the White House for the specimen he examined under a microscope. It was human kidney cells modified with fragments of the Ebola virus, not Ebola cells. A reader's letter reported the error soon after publication; this correction awaited confirmation from the National Institutes of Health, which delayed its response.

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: FLORIDA; 
A Region Where Fortunes Rise and Fall With NASA

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Workers here in the Space Coast region of central Florida returned to their jobs today for the first time since the shuttle disaster, with many worrying how it would affect the local economy even as they mourned the loss of the Columbia's crew.
 Nearly everyone here recalls the slump that followed the destruction of the shuttle Challenger 17 years ago. Shuttle launchings were suspended for more than two years, leading to mass layoffs and business closings, and many fear that may happen again. 
 "A lot of people who worked at the Space Center during Challenger lost their jobs and their homes," said Melissa Fortier-Sherbin, who is on the board of the Titusville Chamber of Commerce. "Every family I knew felt some sort of impact. My mom's business had to close, and my father lost his job after a while. He worked for the company that made the O-rings." 
The Kennedy Space Center is the pride of the Space Coast region, about 40 miles east of Orlando, and its economic mainstay. People here listen for the sonic booms when they know a shuttle is scheduled to come home. And they count on the launchings and landings to support the local economy.
About 15,000 people work at the Kennedy Space Center, with only about 1,600 of them NASA employees, according to the agency's public affairs department. Contractors and subcontractors employ the bulk of the work force, with relatively high-paying, stable jobs. These businesses would suffer a huge blow from a weakened space program, and so would the local tourism industry.
"We are keenly aware that after the Challenger tragedy that two to three years had an impact," said Sam Gutierrez, a spokesman for Space Gateway Support, which provides services like road maintenance to the space center. "We hope that does not occur again."
Economists and tourism experts say it is too soon to know how the economic landscape may change, but they note that the longer NASA suspends regular shuttle launchings, the more difficult it will be.
"A lot of people will be unemployed if the shuttles are grounded for a long period of time," said Antonio Jorge, economics professor at Florida International University. Some businesses diversified and sought other customers after the Challenger disaster, but nothing can completely replace the space program in the region.
"If it's going to be grounded for years, it will be a major disaster for the area," Professor Jorge said.
Florida has one of the strongest economies in the nation. While the job market in most of the country has continued to worsen over the last year, Florida's has improved. Its unemployment rate fell to 5.3 percent in December from 6 percent a year earlier, according to the Labor Department. In that period Florida gained 64,300 jobs, more than any other state.
The state's economy has been buoyed in part by a robust health-care industry serving its many elderly citizens. And because Florida's manufacturing base is relatively small, it has been less affected by the layoffs and plant closings that haunt other states. But the area around Cape Canaveral has not fared quite so well as the rest of the state.
It lost about 1.9 percent of its jobs between December 2001 and December 2002, making its economy look more like the rest of the country's, according to the Florida Agency for Workforce Innovation. Like Orlando's, the region'stourism business fell off after the 2001 terrorism attacks and was slow to recover.
The average income in Brevard County, which includes Cape Canaveral, is about $32,800, the Economic Development Commission of the Florida Space Coast has reported. So the evaporation of 100 jobs would total about $3.3 million in lost wages. By some estimates, as much as $61 million -- 1 percent of the county's estimated $6.1 billion annual payroll -- could disappear in a significant layoff, the commission said.
Gov. Jeb Bush acknowledged today that there would be "some negative impact" on the local economy and added that he had told NASA officials that the communities around the Kennedy Space Center could not afford a two-and-a-half year hiatus of the space program.
"They are very cognizant of that," Governor Bush said, speaking to reporters at Apopka Elementary School in Apopka near Orlando. "The state is prepared to do whatever it can to deal with a slowdown if it happens, including job-training programs," Mr. Bush added.
Some experts say that because many businesses diversified after the Challenger loss, the area is better prepared to absorb a NASA-related downturn. 
"The economy was much more dependent on the space program then than it is now," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, an economic consulting firm in West Chester, Pa. "It's still the largest employer there, but unless NASA shuts down and doesn't conduct any more activity, it shouldn't be a big problem out there."
That is little comfort to Brenda Mulberry, whose business depends on tourists who come to see the space shuttle launchings. 
"We'll be busy for now and then we'll drop like a brick," said Ms. Mulberry, owner of Space Shirts, a company that prints space-related apparel and is two miles south of the space center gate. "I'm worried because I have seven employees, and I don't want to lay them off."
Ms. Mulberry's concerns were echoed by people in bars, restaurants and cafes throughout the region.
"Most people here are involved in the space program," said Sara McCandless, manager, Dunkin' Donuts in nearby Titusville. "They're remembering what happened last time and are scared that's going to happen again."
Paul Salisbury, owner of Paul's Smokehouse Restaurant & Lounge in Titusville, is worried, too. His business is just a few miles from the space center, and offers a clear view of shuttle launchings. Mr. Salisbury estimates that two thirds of his business comes from tourists and NASA-related employees.
The local business "pays the bills" Mr. Salisbury said, and the tourist business provides his profits. "We have a full house during any launch, and a buildup up two weeks in advance," Ms. Salisbury said. "If we don't continue to launch, it has a direct effect on our business."

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN, Feb. 2 

 BODY:
The bodies are gone, but blood still stains the wooden floors at 7 Graham Road. For two weeks now, dozens of mourners have come here to weep and leave flowers in memory of the nine gay men who were killed in an attack on the massage parlor.
 The massacre was front-page news and the story is now well known: on Jan. 20, killers believed to be looking for two gay prostitutes involved in a drug deal entered the massage parlor and shot everyone inside, execution style, even though they could not find the prostitutes they were looking for. Some of the men had their throats slit and their hands bound with tape. 
 What is less commonly known is how gay people here rallied to speed the investigation and to help the families of the dead. Within hours of the killings, the Triangle Project, which counsels gay and lesbian clients, was passing along tips to the police and extending its counseling hours.
The killings of the men -- who were all white and were mostly in their 20's -- have outraged this city known for its tolerance and diversity. Cape Town, the lovely, mountain-ringed city on the southernmost tip of the continent, has even been marketed in recent years to gay tourists from Europe and the United States who flock here for the beautiful scenery and lively night life.
Many of the young men killed were runaways who worked as prostitutes in the white house on Graham Road in Sea Point, a seaside neighborhood that has been increasingly plagued with drugs and crime. Initially, advocates for gay people feared that the victims would be ignored because of their jobs in the sex industry and because the killing was linked to the drug trade. 
But that has not happened. Good Hope Metropolitan Community Church, which ministers to a predominantly gay congregation, has raised money to cover funeral costs for one of the victims, whose family was struggling to pay for his burial. 
The Lesbian and Gay Equality Project, which works for social and economic equality, has put the police sketches of two suspects on its Web site. Hundreds of people, including local politicians in the governing African National Congress, attended memorial services around the city to honor the dead.
"I was surprised by the extent of the response," said Evert Knoesen, national director of the Lesbian and Gay Equality Project. "It was overwhelming. 
"I think men in the gay community are able to understand the difficulties faced by young gay men in a society where poverty is rife and are far more sympathetic to the plight of sex workers generally," he said. "I think people did identify this as an attack on the gay community. People want this thing to be cleared up. They want to know that it's safe to be out there."
The police have worked hard on the investigation and have opened channels of communication, handing the cellphone numbers of senior officials to advocacy and service organizations. Leaders in local government have promised to fight crime more aggressively in the Sea Point community.
"The police have been so receptive to us," said Glenn de Swardt, the manager of clinical services at the Triangle Project. "These guys were sex workers, but they also have partners. They also have mothers. They also have friends. People have really come together around this."
No one has been arrested yet and the police are still struggling to sort out exactly what happened. Investigators are looking for two suspects -- one white and one mixed-race -- between the ages of 25 and 35. The police have said the killings seem to have occurred when the angry killers could not find the drug-dealing prostitutes they were looking for. But detectives are investigating additional leads, which they refuse to discuss.
Relatives of the owner of the massage parlor, Aubrey Otgaar, are maintaining hope that the killers will be caught and put to justice. They are still mourning Mr. Otgaar, who was 56 and, they say, refused to allow drugs to be used in his business.
Mr. Otgaar's relatives said they were wary of politicians getting involved in the memorial services, but they welcomed the outpouring of support from other people.
"It surprised us, how people from all walks of life came out to support us," said Cheryl Cunningham, Mr. Otgaar's sister.
Lauren Cunningham, Mr. Otgaar's niece, said she was particularly touched by the flowers that were tucked in the white picket fence outside the massage parlor on Graham Road. "People came every day," she said. "There was always someone interested in watering the flowers."

From Fuel Cell Cars to Slaughterhouse Inspection: Where the Money Goes

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Department of State
The State Department budget includes substantial increases for treating AIDS, rebuilding Afghanistan and assisting poor countries that institute economic and political reforms. 
 But it pays for many of those increases by trimming other programs, including development aid to countries in Central Europe and Latin America. Over all, the plan calls for an increase of $2.9 billion, or 11 percent, for international affairs, to $28.5 billion, State Department officials said. 
 The budget includes four new initiatives: $1.3 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account, for poor countries that fight corruption and encourage economic and political freedoms; $450 million to combat AIDS, particularly in Africa and the Caribbean; $200 million in emergency food assistance; and $145 million to encourage democratic institutions in Arab countries.
The administration, which has been criticized for failing to invest more heavily in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, included at least $500 million for such programs, including $150 million to equip a national army there. 
To help pay for the new programs, assistance to the independent states of the former Soviet Union, for example, would fall to $576 million from $755 million. Russia alone would lose $75 million under the plan. 
The budget would also cut money for international peacekeeping operations, to $550 million from $725 million. And it eliminates $25 million in annual aid to Iraqi opposition groups, underscoring the administration's confidence that President Saddam Hussein will be removed by October, when the 2004 fiscal year begins.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: White Plains: Home Prices Rise In Westchester 

BYLINE:  By Stacy Albin (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 Despite a troubled economy, prices for existing homes rose sharply last year in Westchester and Putnam Counties. 
In Westchester, the average cost of a single-family home rose to $525,000, up about 17 percent from the previous year, according to the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, a realty group. In Putnam, homes sold for an average of $305,000, up about 21 percent. P. Gilbert Mercurio, the chief executive officer of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, said that demand remained high because of a limited stock and because the houses were less than one hour's commuting distance from Manhattan.

Insiders' Insider, for the Best Seats
 Fashion has its share of master puppeteers, adept at pulling the strings that jerk events into motion. One of the most skillful is Pierre Rougier, a publicist whose nod assures insiders tickets to the hottest shows of Fashion Week, which opens in New York on Friday. 
 Mr. Rougier represents Nicolas Ghesquiere, the designer for Balenciaga, who presents his fall collection on Feb. 13 at an undisclosed location. About 200 guests are expected to rub flanks and strain in unison for a front-row glimpse of Asia Argento, the actress who is Mr. Ghesquiere's friend and sometime muse, or Nicole Kidman, whom the designer has also dressed. Neither Ms. Argento nor Ms. Kidman has confirmed attendance. 
Another of Mr. Rougier's clients, Proenza Schouler, will show on Feb. 12 at the National Arts Club. The club admits 120 guests, compared with 1,000 or more accommodated by the largest of the tents at Bryant Park, the official setting for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, leaving hundreds of others out in the cold. Will some be miffed? You bet. "Shows with limited seating create a kerfuffle about who's in and who's out," said Sally Singer, an editor at Vogue, who counts herself on the in-list.
Such tactics are calculated "to drive people crazy," said Fern Mallis, executive director of Seventh on Sixth, which produces Fashion Week. Another source of her ire is the scheduling of the Proenza Schouler show at 5 p.m., a slot reserved by Ms. Mallis for a Seventh Avenue veteran, Donald Deal. "Proenza will just have to move," Ms. Mallis said. "Why not? They haven't sent out their tickets." Mr. Rougier said he would not move the show. 
He never intended to gum up the calendar, Mr. Rougier said, or send the uninvited to their analysts to work through feelings of rejection. He conceded that limiting the size of shows creates a "certain furor." Not that he is gloating. The glare of the spotlight has Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, the designers for Proenza Schouler, feeling "quite stressed," Mr. Hernandez said. "We are feeling the pressure to develop a fashion signature," he said, adding that the collection will "play with the idea of contradiction, showing matte fabrics versus shiny, and layering cashmere and a lot of classic fabrics." 
Classicism tweaked with whimsy is also the signature of Palmer Jones, a line designed by 24-year-old identical twins, Kathryn and Lindy, who are both former design assistants to Ralph Lauren. Their presentation on Sunday at Christie's in Rockefeller Center will be built on tailored pieces leavened with wit -- as in a blue velvet jacket embroidered with magpies toting Swarovski crystals in their beaks. 
Theirs is a playful but polished style that, for Ms. Singer of Vogue, signals a return to elegance. "In this economy people want value for money," Ms. Singer said. "That means good tailoring in a dress you can wear a few years."
Influential retailers will also scrutinize the collections for signs of a ladylike silhouette. "I'm looking for elegance, but with a little bit of punch," said Linda Dresner, who caters to an upscale clientele. Referring to last year's surfeit of bondage and paramilitary influence, Jeffrey Kalinksy of Jeffrey New York chimed in: "I'm hoping to see something less aggressive. Show me something with a bunch of buckles on it, and I could care less."

Ryder Chosen by Jacobs
Was it only three months ago that Winona Ryder mesmerized Americans at her shoplifting trial, in part because of the chic Marc Jacobs outfits she sometimes wore to court? One person who noticed was Mr. Jacobs, among fashion's leading provocateurs, who has cast Ms. Ryder in his spring advertising campaign. 
Ms. Ryder was convicted of stealing $5,560 worth of goods from Saks Fifth Avenue, including a Marc Jacobs sweater priced at $760. 
Yesterday, Mr. Jacobs was quoted by Women's Wear Daily asserting that he was inspired to use Ms. Ryder "because I thought she looked so beautiful in all these pictures that we've seen recently," both at the trial and elsewhere. The ads, photographed by Juergen Teller, show the actress lounging in a posh hotel room clad in a white robe and pale pumps by Mr. Jacobs, one of the designer's handbags propped at her feet.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 8, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Front Row column of the Fashion page on Tuesday about preparations for New York Fashion Week referred incorrectly to the twins who design the Palmer Jones line. Only one, Kathryn Jones, was formerly an assistant to Ralph Lauren; her sister, Lindy Jones, was not.
The report also misstated the sisters' ages. They are 38, not 24.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS; 
Projection of Economy Takes a Cautious View

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Compared with President Bush's nearly euphoric budget two years ago, the one the president put forward today was a splash of cold water.
 The White House's economic outlook, which provides a crucial basis for its budget projections, assumes that growth this year will be uninspiring, that unemployment will barely decline either this year or next and that tax revenues will be nearly stagnant. 
 The outlook is in some ways more cautious than those of private economists. Between that caution and the impact of Mr. Bush's big tax-cutting proposals, the White House predicted today that the federal government would run up an accumulated deficit of $1.08 trillion by the end of 2008. 
That is a stunning deterioration from just two years ago, when President Bush predicted a $5.6 trillion surplus over 10 years. But by not using overly optimistic assumptions to make the long-run numbers look better, Mr. Bush won some praise for candor.
"At a stroke, the new White House budget forecasts have shifted from utterly implausible to realistic," said Ian Shepherdson, a senior economist at High-Frequency Economics, a forecasting and consulting firm.
Other analysts disagree, noting that the administration provided only a five-year projection for the budget as a whole and that some of Mr. Bush's tax cuts will not affect the budget until several years later.
The budget does not include extra money for a possible war in Iraq, though White House officials restated today that Mr. Bush would immediately ask for extra money in a supplemental appropriation if a war did take place. Indeed, the White House budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., said last Thursday that the administration might ask for more military money even if there was no war in Iraq.
The budget also leaves out the cost of changing the alternative minimum tax, something that Mr. Bush has not formally proposed but that Republicans and Democrats agree is needed to prevent millions of families from facing sharply higher taxes in the years ahead as their higher incomes qualify them for the tax. 
A change in the alternative minimum tax could cost about $500 billion over the next 10 years, some analysts say.
In the past, overly optimistic assumptions about economic growth have often been an important tool for budgetary mischief because they allow a president to assume the existence of more tax revenue and avoid making painful trade-offs among favored goals.
The economic assumptions this year are not especially optimistic.
The budget assumes that economic growth will be 2.9 percent this year, weak for a country coming out of a recession but in line with private forecasts. Growth is projected to climb to 3.6 percent in 2004, which is slightly more optimistic than the Congressional Budget Office but in line with private forecasts. 
The White House was even more cautious in predicting tax revenues, which it said would decline slightly in 2003 and climb only modestly in 2004.
The budget assumes that unemployment, which is stuck at 6 percent, will remain at 5.9 percent this year and drop only slowly after that. Even at the end of five years, the administration estimated, joblessness would still be 5.1 percent, well above the low levels reached at the peak of the last economic boom.
The predicted upshot is that the federal deficit will hit a record of $304 billion in 2003 and climb to $307 billion in 2004. Though the deficit would decline after that, it would still be $190 billion in 2008. 
The contrast with two years ago could not be starker. Then, as now, President Bush was proposing big tax cuts to stimulate the economy. But in 2001, Mr. Bush assumed that the good times of the late 1990's would continue more or less uninterrupted and that the government faced a future of surpluses as far as the eye could see.
Mr. Bush's current budget implies a significant gamble.
Though White House officials are loath to draw comparisons, the combination of tax cuts and spending increases and projected deficits are at least as radical as those of President Ronald Reagan's 1981 "riverboat gamble," the budget characterization immortalized by Senator Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, then the Republican majority leader.
What few lawmakers or administration officials like to discuss, however, is that skyrocketing deficits forced Mr. Reagan to swallow tax increases a few years later. The first President Bush, in a decision that many Republicans still regret, felt compelled to agree to further tax increases as the deficit set records in the early 1990's.
White House officials say times have changed. Today's deficits, they say, are still less than 3 percent of gross domestic product, in contrast to 5 percent under President Reagan and 6 percent in the last year of the first Bush presidency.
 Looked at another way, they say, the deficits are easily affordable. Interest payments on the national debt make up only 8 percent of government spending. In the heyday of deficits, they were about 15 percent.
But administration officials have doggedly refused to answer the question of how big a deficit has to be before it ceases to become manageable and starts to become alarming.
"I don't know," Mr. Daniels, the budget director, said today. "All I can say is that if you look at history and you take in the context, we're not there now, or close."

HEADLINE: Mattel's Profit Is Up by 35%, Led by Sales Of Barbies 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: EL SEGUNDO, Calif., Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Mattel Inc., the world's largest toymaker, said today that its fourth-quarter profit rose 35 percent after the company reduced costs and increased sales of Barbie dolls in the United States for the first time in at least two years.
 Net income climbed to $186.1 million, or 42 cents a share, from $138 million, or 31 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales increased 6.9 percent, to $1.67 billion. 
 Barbie sales in the United States climbed 9 percent, led by new products like Barbie as Rapunzel and My Scene Barbie dolls. Robert Eckert, Mattel's chief executive, is extending Mattel's traditional lines by introducing variations like the new Barbies and Chicken Dance Elmo. He is also expanding Mattel's sales outside the United States and has widened margins by reducing inventory and paring packaging costs.
"They are doing a lot of things to make operations more efficient," said Mark Greenberg, the manager of the Invesco Leisure Fund, which holds Mattel shares. "Toys aren't a high-growth business."
Excluding $25.4 million in pretax costs to settle suits tied to the 1999 purchase of the Learning Company, Mattel said it would have earned $190.3 million, or 43 cents a share. On that basis, Mattel was expected to earn 38 cents a share, according to Thomson First Call.
Shares of Mattel, based in El Segundo, rose $1.03, or 5.2 percent, to $21.03.
Mr. Eckert said he expected the retail environment that led to store closings and the reorganization of companies like Kmart to continue this year. Retailers' holiday sales at stores open at least a year showed the smallest gains in about three decades as consumers concerned about the economy pared spending.
Mattel will stop giving earnings forecasts, Mr. Eckert said on a conference call with investors, after reiterating the company's goal of increasing profit by at least 10 percent.
"The whole area around guidance has become a matter of principle for me," he said.
Coca-Cola and the McDonald's have also said they will stop providing forecasts so that they can concentrate on longer-term objectives to enhance growth.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE AGENDA; 
Laying Out 'Big Ideas,' Not Balancing Ledger

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
When all the proposals are tallied in the budget President Bush submitted today, they amount to the most ambitious changes in government operations that any president has put forward in decades.
 Beyond its scope, the budget differs from those of other recent presidents in two important ways. Nowhere does Mr. Bush make balancing the budget an important goal. And he makes no claim that the era of big government is over, or even nearing an end. 
 "This is a president of big projects and big ideas," his budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., said today. 
Contrast that with the assertion of Mr. Bush's father in his inaugural address in 1989 that "we have more will than wallet."
Paying no heed to the notion of a balanced budget, Mr. Bush advocates deep tax cuts on top of the large ones enacted two years ago. By contrast, when big deficits began to appear after President Ronald Reagan drove tax cuts through Congress in 1981, Mr. Reagan approved offsetting tax increases.
Mr. Bush proposes adding a Medicare entitlement, prescription drug coverage. But he also proposes enticing retirees into private insurance plans, a big step that other Republican presidents have surely dreamed of but never taken. He also wants to change Medicaid so that many poor people, including some in nursing homes, will no longer be guaranteed benefits.
The president proposes doubling spending next year for domestic security, including new money for the largest new federal department since the Defense Department was created after World War II. Military spending would rise sharply over the next five years. Much of the new money would be spent for disputable initiatives like a missile defense system and futuristic ships.
All this does not take account of the billions of dollars that would be needed to fight a war against Iraq. And it does not assume any big changes in Social Security, despite the president's call in his State of the Union address last week to make Social Security more like a private pension.
Except for the first two years of Bill Clinton's presidency, this is the first time in more than 20 years that a budget has been submitted for a fiscal year in which both houses of Congress will be controlled by the president's party.
No doubt, that will be an advantage for Mr. Bush. No one is saying this budget is dead on arrival, the term given to most of the budgets offered by Mr. Bush's three most recent predecessors, who generally faced at least one house of Congress controlled by the opposition party.
In his first two years in the White House, when he did have a Democratic Congress, Mr. Clinton failed miserably when he tried to push a few ambitious measures, most notably his plan for universal health insurance. Congress, it was widely said at the time, could not deal with such an extensive undertaking.
Partly as a consequence, Republicans won the House and Senate in the 1994 elections. For the rest of his presidency, Mr. Clinton limited his budget requests to bite-size pieces like encouraging schoolchildren to wear uniforms and cracking down on deadbeat fathers.
This downsizing of presidential ambition proved to be popular politically, and Mr. Clinton was re-elected with ease.
Of course, it is impossible to say whether Mr. Bush will be thwarted by Congressional overload. If the country goes to war, Congress might be too distracted to deal with his bold plans. Or the distraction could mean that some proposals that are not particularly popular could slip through without much attention being paid.
The early line is that Congress will initially balk at the president's spending priorities -- large spending increases for the military, domestic security and veterans and not much new money for anything else -- but eventually adopt the priorities more or less intact.
Taxes are another matter. Some form of tax reduction will probably be adopted. And it will probably be sufficiently like what the president proposed that he can call it the Bush tax cut when he runs for re-election next year.
But the centerpiece of his proposal, an elimination of the income tax for individuals on most stock dividends, has been received with little enthusiasm in Congress. Interviews with a range of lawmakers found none willing to say they thought that this was the best way to use the $364 billion that Mr. Bush wants to allot for the cut.
It is too early to gauge the Congressional response to plans disclosed late last week for new forms of savings accounts in which money would accumulate tax-free and be available for withdrawal without penalty. 
The details of the president's Medicare proposal have not been completed. But even without prescription drug coverage, Medicare is, along with Social Security, the most popular government program ever devised. Any president who tries to dismantle it is taking a huge risk.
Mr. Bush apparently has no intention of pushing any time soon for one of his boldest plans -- allowing workers to use part of their Social Security taxes to set up private investment accounts. That would cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the first few years alone, and the new budget has no money set aside for the next five years.
Mr. Daniels said this morning, "A balanced federal budget remains a high priority for this president." But unlike the submissions of recent predecessors, this budget describes no plans to reach that goal.
In all the years when large deficits were a fact of life, Republican politicians and conservative economists could advocate a balanced budget with no hope that the goal would be reached but confident that steps in that direction would lead to less government spending.
But when surpluses began to appear in the late 1990's, these politicians and economists became less enamored of the concept of balance, and Mr. Bush apparently was no exception.
"It is wrong to build surpluses, because these surpluses lead to higher spending," said John F. Cogan, a top budget official in the Reagan and first Bush administrations who is now an economist at the Hoover Institution. "Governments cannot hang onto money."
Representative Jim Nussle, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee, made a similar point. The goal of a balanced budget, Mr. Nussle said, is no longer the "holy grail" that it once was.

HEADLINE: Mr. Bloomberg Goes to Albany, Hat in Hand, and Gets Shrug 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg came here today to make one of the most important presentations of his 13 months in office, calling on New York State to help save New York City at the time of its worst fiscal crisis since the 1970's.
 But if the mayor was hoping for any promises, he came away disappointed. 
 In their own ways, each of the three powers that control state government reacted coolly to Mr. Bloomberg's pitch, made during a joint legislative hearing and later in private meetings with lawmakers.
Republicans in the Senate made it clear that they remained adamantlyopposed to the mayor's central request, the reimposition of a commuter tax. So did Gov. George E. Pataki, the mayor's friend and ally. And while Assembly Democrats said they would support some form of commuter tax, they took the mayor to task for being too soft on the governor in his fight for more help for the city. 
Mr. Bloomberg, for his part, praised Governor Pataki at every turn, even as he complained that the state budget that the governor proposed last week would hurt New York City. 
He said that the governor's budget would force 44,000 of New York City's 4-year-olds from their prekindergarten classes, eliminate 1,900 teaching jobs and add to the crushing amount the city spends on health care. He also said that the city had already been counting on much of the aid that the governor pledged to get for the city from state-controlled authorities, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Battery Park City Authority.
Even when questioned by the joint committee of the Assembly and the Senate, Mayor Bloomberg refrained from putting a dollar figure on how much money Mr. Pataki's budget would cost his city. Some budget monitors have said that Mr. Pataki's budget proposal could cost New York City as much as $2 billion, a figure the governor disputed today at a news conference in which he defended his budget plan. 
After Mr. Bloomberg finished testifying, reporters asked why he did not criticize Mr. Pataki.
"I'd rather have this governor as governor than anybody else," he said.
He proclaims himself optimistic that he will reach a resolution: "I think we'll work something out."
For mayors of New York City, the trip up the Hudson to testify about the state budget is an annual rite of winter. But with the city and state facing such serious projected deficits -- $3.4 billion next year for the city, and $9.3 billion for the state (cumulatively $11.5 billion over two years) -- it was an especially critical trip this year.
Now that Mayor Bloomberg has cut city spending by $2.6 billion and raised property taxes by 18.5 percent, he is counting on the state to close much of the remaining gap by imposing a commuter tax, giving more education aid, and allowing new tolls, among other things.
Some lawmakers held out hope that, while the mayor's new proposal to alter the income tax and raise the rate to 2.7 percent would not fly in Albany, there might be support for a return to the 0.45 percent tax on commuters to the city, which was repealed in 1999.
But the politics of the day were unusual. Mr. Bloomberg, a Democrat turned Republican, got perhaps his warmest welcome from Democrats in the Assembly, who said they supported some form of commuter tax and that they would fight the governor's plan to cut aid to city schools, welfare and health care.
But Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver complained that Mr. Bloomberg was not a forceful enough advocate for the city. Mr. Silver, a Democrat who represents Lower Manhattan, said the mayor had missed an opportunity by failing to get commitments of help from Governor Pataki before he was re-elected in November.
"I think it's time for him to say: 'If this money isn't there, it is clearly removed by the governor of this state. Period,' " Mr. Silver said after meeting with the mayor.
He went on to mimic, with some accuracy, the mayor's standard response to questions about state aid for the city.
"It should not be, 'Well, this document, that's a negotiating document, right now doesn't contain it, but I'm hopeful that the governor and the majority leader with the speaker in the end will provide the resources so that we can continue to educate children,' " he said.
The mayor got a cooler reception from the Republican-controlled Senate on the commuter tax, even has he continued to make the case that New York State, New Jersey, Yonkers and many other places tax commuters at the same rate as residents. The mayor's budget relies on $1 billion in revenues from changing the laws so that income taxes are based on where an employee works, not where he lives. 
During the joint legislative hearing, Mr. Bloomberg sparred over the commuter tax with State Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Nassau County Republican whom the mayor took on his private plane to Greece last year. Mr. Skelos protested that taxes were already high in the suburbs, and said no one was trying to tax reverse commuters who live in the city or the city residents who flock to Hamptons beaches each summer.
Mr. Bloomberg -- who said his proposal was not a commuter tax but was instead "tax reform" -- said New York State taxpayers had already bailed out Nassau County, which ran into budget troubles even before the recession began. And he said city Hamptonites do pay taxes.
"We do pay, when we go out to the Hamptons, part of the local taxes," the mayor said. "We pay property taxes in the Hamptons -- probably property taxes, if I read what the price of real estate is in the Hamptons, that generate a lot more revenue for the local municipalities out there than the services they have to provide."' 
The mayor met later over sandwiches and popcorn with the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, a strong opponent of the tax. When the meeting ended, Mr. Bruno sounded almost as if he was leaving the door open to the tax, saying, "We're not getting into the specifics of what may be acceptable or not."
But a top aide to Mr. Bruno said afterward that he was just being polite, and that in his view the commuter tax was a "nonstarter." And while Senate Republicans from New York City said they would support some form of commuter tax, as did some Senate Democrats, they conceded it would be hard to reimpose.
Governor Pataki, at a news conference, protested that his budget provided "a net fiscal benefit for the city in excess of a billion dollars." But that figure included federal aid and aid from state-controlled authorities, which Mayor Bloomberg said was already counted in his budget. An analysis by the State Senate's finance staff estimated that the governor's budget proposal would net the city $81 million. 
The governor also disputed the mayor's contention that his Medicaid proposals would cost the city money. Mr. Bloomberg said it would cost the city $250 million next year. Governor Pataki said that the proposal would net the city $40 million.
When the governor was asked about the commuter tax, he reiterated his position that new taxes would have a negative impact on the economy. "I just think that at this very sensitive time, from an economic standpoint, we would be damaging our ability to create jobs," he said.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE MILITARY; 
Despite Bush's Vow, Spending on High-Tech Weapons Remains at Low Level

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
President Bush's Department of Defense budget for 2004, at $379.9 billion, would increase spending across the board, with the biggest increases going to higher pay, a new aircraft carrier and new fighter jets.
 The budget does not include money for military action against Iraq or for the campaign against terrorism, but it does provide for sharp increases for the administration's missile defense program. 
 For nearly two years, the Bush administration has said that this budget, which would increase military spending by 4.2 percent, would transform the Pentagon by moving money from outmoded cold war armaments into high-tech weaponry. While the budget identifies about $25 billion in what the administration terms transformational programs, the bulk would go to traditional armaments, some decades old and others still in development. 
Since money for any military action requires a separate Congressional appropriation, Mr. Bush's 2004 budget covers only ongoing programs. For soldiers, it calls for a $10 billion increase for housing, health programs and raises of 2 percent to 6.25 percent.
Big increases are also requested in shipbuilding, a $12 billion line item that calls for the construction of seven vessels, including three destroyers and a carrier. Recent budgets have financed five ships annually, but the Bush administration says seven vessels must be built each year to maintain a 300-ship fleet.
The Air Force received support for its top priority, the F/A-22, a fighter jet that costs $200 million a plane and has been in development for more than 10 years. Cost overruns for the F/A-22 have been measured in hundreds of millions of dollars, leading to speculation that the program might be cut. But $5.2 billion is requested to build the first 22 of a planned 267-jet fleet.
There were also no cuts in the program for the V-22 Osprey, an aircraft being designed for the Marines that takes off like a helicopter but flies like an airplane. Although marines have been killed in test flights, the Osprey remains the service's No. 1 request. The Army is receiving a variety of vehicles to replace heavily armored tanks, including the Stryker armored vehicle, which was also thought to face cuts.
"We believe that this is a good deal for the taxpayer," Dov S. Zakheim, the Pentagon comptroller, said in a briefing. "We are spending significant portions of our budget on transformation. Our program is balanced, and it is executable."
Critics said that for all the talk by Mr. Zakheim and the administration about transformation, the budget moves only slightly in that direction.
"They are calling things transformational that have been in the works for 10 to 15 years," said Christopher Hellman, an analyst at the Center for Defense Information, which studies the Pentagon budget. " 'Transformation' has become a buzzword. But I do not see a fundamental shifting of resources away from traditional priorities to new ones."
Charles Pena, director of defense policy studies at the Cato Institute, a free-market research group, said the budget was large enough to provide for both traditional armaments as well as more futuristic items. 
"It's huge," Mr. Pena said of the budget. "The Defense Department is going to be given a carte blanche, and defense transformation is pretty much out the window. We may see some transforming stuff, but it will not take place at the expense of anything in the pipeline."
At more than $1 billion a day, the United States' military budget would be larger than the combined military spending of the next 11 nations. Mr. Zakheim took pains to point out that the 2004 military budget would represent 16.6 percent of all federal spending, compared with 27.3 percent in the late 1980's.
A total of $9.1 billion is requested for the missile defense program. A Pentagon handout said this was for 10 land-based interceptor missiles to provide "modest capability against North Korean missiles." No other country was mentioned. The Pentagon handout said that another 10 land-based missiles, along with 20 sea-based missiles, would be added in 2005, adding "modest capability against Middle East threats."
Missile defense is among the biggest of the $25 billion in budget items identified as transformational. Others are a long-range strike aircraft, unmanned submarines, aerial drones and improved communication and informational technologies.

HEADLINE: The Imbalanced Budget 

 BODY:
The $2.23 trillion budget unveiled by the Bush administration yesterday is the furthest thing from a fiscally conservative document. It shifts taxes from today's citizens to those of the future. Rather than truly giving state governments the power to be flexible, it sticks them with the responsibility for delivering the bad news to poor people who will be denied a health care safety net. The gargantuan defense budget is bloated with money for old-style weaponry needed only by defense contractors and military empire builders.
 President Bush's underlying budget philosophy can be seen in the contrast of two alarmingly aggressive proposals. In one, the administration invites states to slash Medicaid programs for many of the poor. It cynically eases the burden of deficit-ridden governors by offering them an initial budget sweetener along with the undoubtedly tempting management "freedom" to make severe cutbacks in health care benefits on their own. 
 Meanwhile, the White House would significantly enlarge the amount of investment income that could be permanently sheltered from taxes in savings and retirement accounts. This is a switch that would benefit mainly higher-bracket Americans who have the surplus income to save more than current Individual Retirement Account programs allow. Since current workers might withdraw money from their existing I.R.A.'s, pay taxes and put the money in these more flexible accounts, the plan could create a one-time increase in tax revenue now, in return for sharply diminished revenue in the future. That's typical of so much of this administration's party-now-pay-later attitude toward the government's finances.
Mr. Bush's theory is that the new savings accounts, along with an accelerated series of income tax cuts and this year's proposal for dramatically reducing the tax on dividends, will create growth that will stimulate new waves of revenue into the Treasury. But the administration dropped any budget forecast beyond five years -- the point at which the full force of all its policies will be felt, for better or for worse. Meanwhile, the new fiscal year's budget includes a record deficit of $307 billion, with the total red ink adding up to more than $1 trillion over the next five years. The Concord Coalition, the watchdog group that helped prod the budget toward balance in the 90's, is warning politicians in their tax-cutting frenzy that "deficits merely shift the tax burden toward the future." Besides that, it will shift it downward to the states, which are left to struggle with the sluggish economy and the demands of anti-terrorism preparations without the necessary increase in federal assistance.
The president's budget offers the nation the biggest military buildup since the cold-war years of Ronald Reagan, including more than $9 billion for the still unproved missile defense program. All the resolute campaign talk of finally cutting pork and defense boondoggles has gone by the wayside amid the dual drumbeats of homeland security bureaucracy and an invasion of Iraq. Yet the cost of that war is not even provided for in the budget, and the money for homeland security is heavily tilted toward capital spending for projects like overhauling the Coast Guard fleet, while other aspects of emergency preparedness, like border patrol and customs, are virtually ignored.
The administration is clearly intent on using the war on terrorism and the return to deficit budgeting to dish up a wish list of policy initiatives for the new Republican-controlled Congress. When it comes to Mr. Bush's 10-year, $400 billion Medicare reform proposal, even his party's moderates question whether the president should force the elderly to choose between the popular traditional fee-for-service care and prescription drug aid.
Mr. Bush has included some commendable nods to the compassionate side of compassionate conservatism, notably the increase in AIDS assistance for Africa. But over all, this budget is an act of buck-passing and procrastination as much as accounting.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: CONGRESS; 
For Republicans, Praise for President's Budget Is Selective

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
The Democrats had stockpiled red ink to dramatize the record deficits in President Bush's 2004 budget, and within hours of its release the printers on Capitol Hill were churning out crimson charts and the incendiary statements.
 "The most fiscally damaging budget in U.S. history," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. "President Bush is leading the most fiscally irresponsible administration in history," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, calling the proposal "a budget-busting epic disaster." 
 But the volume of the Democratic blasts was in inverse proportion to the party's power because the Republicans who now control both houses of Congress plan to use the administration's spending plan as the foundation for next year's government. Although some acknowledged that not all of the 62 proposed tax cuts or credits in the plan would be approved, party leaders gave the weighty budget books a warmer reception than any submission has received in years. 
"In this budget, President Bush charts a straightforward course for peace and prosperity for America," said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee. "That includes defeating terrorism, creating jobs and dealing with looming shortfalls in entitlement spending."
Nonetheless, the Republicans seemed to acknowledge tacitly that even they may find it difficult to vote for each and every tax cut demanded by the administration if the result is an unending prospect of deficits. Having spent years accusing Democrats of driving the government into the poorhouse, many Republicans confined their praise to the president's ceilings on spending, without mentioning the deficits at all.
Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Republican leader, took pains to note that spending grew by about 4 percent, the same as the average American paycheck. But Dr. Frist's statement did not mention the record $307 billion deficit for 2004, an amount that would grow to $2.1 trillion over 10 years if all of the administration's tax cuts were enacted.
None of the Republican leaders who spoke today made a firm commitment to passing all of those proposed tax cuts, aware that a newly influential group of moderate Republicans will not go along with the full package.
The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, called the budget an "excellent starting point," but he declined to say that he would pursue every tax cut in the plan. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert said in a statement that the plan was a "common-sense budget," and that it recognized that economic growth was necessary to restore balance. But other Republicans clearly felt obliged to address the huge gap between revenues and spending that Mr. Bush called for.
"The biggest challenge we will face is controlling spending while meeting all of these needs," said Representative Jim Nussle of Iowa, chairman of the House Budget Committee, who in previous years had singed Democrats for deficit spending. Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio said some of the cutbacks in the budget would hurt his constituents.
"Certainly there are many programs, including some important to Ohio, which take a hit," Mr. Voinovich said.
Among the most closely watched members of Congress on budgetary issues are a group of moderate Senate Republicans who may determine the future of the tax proposals, and one of them -- Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine -- made it clear that she was uncomfortable by the large number of minuses in the budget books.
"We must exercise prudence and caution," Senator Snowe said, "and balance the near term need for tax cuts to help stimulate the economy and new spending to meet pressing priorities, against the long-term goal of maintaining fiscal responsibility and balancing the budget."
The Democrats, however, dispensed with the moderates' caution and issued some of the strongest criticisms to date of the administration's plans. They expressed incredulity at the limits on spending for domestic security, education and health care, with Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts calling it a "ripoff for the rich" that starved vital domestic programs.
Several Democrats noted that the $5.6 trillion surplus of two years ago had evaporated, replaced by a $2.1 trillion deficit over 10 years that Mr. Daschle called "the worst fiscal collapse in our history."
Though Republicans said the proposed deficits were mild by historical standards, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the ranking Democrat on the budget committee, said the deficits would be worsened by the retirement of the baby-boom generation in about a dozen years.
"I think this budget is breathtaking in its lack of fiscal responsibility," Mr. Conrad said. "It's one thing to have tax cuts at a time of economic weakness to give lift to the economy -- that makes sense, that I would support even if we were in deficit -- but what the president is proposing is huge tax cuts beyond the time of projected economic weakness, at times he's forecasting strong economic growth. He is digging a hole that is very, very deep for this country."

HEADLINE: A Tax Code Not Intended For Amateurs 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
With nearly all the tax forms, interest statements and income reports now delivered to tens of millions of American mailboxes, the annual dread of spending a lot of time and money compiling a tax return is back with a vengeance.
 It was not always so. Not so long ago, Washington managed to hack through much of the underbrush of the tax code in an overhaul that President Ronald Reagan signed into law in 1986. But in the years after, lawmakers started adding dozens of provisions to the individual and corporate income tax systems, contributing to their complexity and helping the tax preparation industry grow into an even larger business. 
 It is no wonder that many Americans turn to professionals to prepare their returns. This year's instruction manual for the federal government's individual income tax adds up to 126 pages, a far cry from the 56 pages needed in 1987, after the revision took effect. 
In short, said Warren B. Rudman, who voted for the 1986 tax law as a Republican senator from New Hampshire, "you have a nice wool blanket looking like a patchwork quilt again."
The system is complicated enough that trying to abolish a tax can add new headaches. President Bush's apparently simple plan to end individual taxes on dividends, for example, is in fact quite complicated, said Brenda K. Schafer, senior tax research coordinator at H&R Block. "When you look at it deeper," she said, "you find out that not all dividends are excludable."
Seventeen years after the tax code was overhauled, why has this crippling complexity returned? The reasons are almost entirely political, said Joel B. Slemrod, director of the Office of Tax Policy Research at the University of Michigan. Raising taxes so that more money could be spent had become taboo in Washington, so politicians had to find another way to cater to their constituencies. Tax changes -- in the form of credits, subsidies, deductions and refunds -- were the answer.
Others take the argument further. "The tax system," said C. Eugene Steuerle, who coordinated the Treasury Department's tax reform group from 1984 to 1986 and is now president of the National Tax Association, "has become the vehicle of choice for influencing economic policy, the distribution of the tax burden, the state of the economy, the social welfare of families, and almost anything else you want to mention."
Democrats, Mr. Steuerle added, found that they could achieve social goals using the tax code. In doing so, they were taking a page from the playbook of Republicans, who had long used the tax system to encourage business investment.
"What's different today," he asserted, "is that the tax breaks in the tax system are much more oriented toward social expenditures than they are toward business-type incentives."
In the 1990's, after Republicans had led the charge to push down tax rates at the top, the Democrats ushered in larger credits and new subsidies to help working and middle-class families with the costs of child care and education. Other provisions were also added to the code.
"Some of these were for such strange things as building school buildings, which are hardly things one thinks of as going to the tax system to do," Mr. Steuerle said. "But they did it anyway."
Besides avoiding the political criticism associated with sharply increasing spending, using the tax system as a way of achieving policy goals had another advantage. Where the budgeted cost of spending programs made headlines every year, Professor Slemrod said, few people stopped to sum up the cost of tax credits and the like. "A lot of these things don't get the same kind of scrutiny they would get if they were stand-alone expenditure programs."
Yet using the income tax system to promote social policy goals does not always work, especially when changes are aimed at low-income people, said Fred T. Goldberg Jr., a former I.R.S. commissioner who is now a partner of the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom in Washington. "When you have a world where 30 to 40 percent of the people don't pay an income tax," Mr. Goldberg said, "it's not a tool that's very precisely targeted to the folks you might want to pay attention to."
Fiddling with taxes on businesses can also have harmful consequences, Mr. Goldberg said. "It is a direct path from complexity to corporate tax shelters."
And when it comes time to file a return, complexity hurts taxpayers, and the Internal Revenue Service, directly. "The system is just in some ways out of control," Mr. Steuerle maintained. "The resources aren't there for the I.R.S., and taxpayers can't deal with it."
The cost to taxpayers, in time and frustration, may even outweigh the beneficial effects of some new rules, suggested Pamela F. Olson, the assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax policy. Overlapping or inconsistent provisions in the tax code have added to the complexity, she said, and made errors on returns more likely. 
Elements of the tax code can have unintended consequences that will punish future taxpayers, as well. As a result, some provisions of the tax system need revision, the experts said, either in the very near future or within a few years.
The most obvious offender, Mr. Rudman said, is the alternative minimum tax. The rule voids most itemized deductions and credits for filers who might otherwise have paid less tax, instead imposing one of two flat rates on their incomes. It also takes on the form of double taxation because people required to compute their taxes that way cannot deduct state and local income taxes from their federal obligation. And it is growing fast.
About 1.3 million people paid the alternative minimum tax in 2000. Unless the law is changed, Professor Slemrod estimates, about 35 million people could fall under its embrace within a decade.
Mr. Steuerle called the tax a "monster" that is "about to envelop almost every middle-income family with children in the country." The applicability of the tax is growing so quickly, he said, "that if you look at the Bush tax cuts in 2001, they really did very little for people in the upper-middle-income ranges because so many of them get hit with the A.M.T."
Fixing that problem would require hundreds of billions of dollars in additional revenue or borrowing in the next few years.
And yet another expensive tax twist needs to be addressed soon: the strange plan for the estate tax.
The estate tax rate is to fall to zero in 2010 from 45 percent in 2009, then return to 55 percent in 2011. The amount exempt will also drop, to $1 million in 2011 from $3.5 million in 2009.
To the astute estate planner, dying in 2010 might seem like an excellent idea. "That is just way too morbid, to think about what the incentives would be," Professor Slemrod said. "A rational Congress would certainly deal with that well before 2009."
Other provisions of the 10-year tax plan that became law in 2001 are also giving tax preparers headaches. "It's difficult to remember what's what -- what takes effect in 2001 versus 2002," Ms. Schafer of H&R Block said. "Only to us, to tax professionals, is that something we're really concerned with."
These problems, and many others, might be dealt with in a single stroke if the nation moved to a radically different tax system, like a flat tax that imposes a uniform rate on wage income above a certain threshold, or a national sales tax. The latter idea has been advocated by R. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers; the Treasury Department has been researching several similar options.
Mr. Rudman said he would not necessarily support either proposal. Nonetheless, he acknowledged, "either a flat tax, which in my view has a lot of problems with it, or a value-added tax, which probably has a lot fewer problems, is the only way you're going to get rid of the complexities in this code."
A national sales tax would be an especially hard sell, said Jack F. Kemp, the former lawmaker who helped lead the 1986 tax overhaul through the House as a Republican from New York. He said that it would be hard to make the tax fair to low-income families, and that it would be too easy, once established, to raise the rate. "Realistically, they're never going to get rid of the income tax," he said.
The political obstacles to any all-encompassing change, even if the income tax remains at the system's core, could be insurmountable. Mr. Rudman said he doubted that popular tax breaks like the personal income tax deduction for mortgage interest (worth $300 billion to homeowners in 2000) and the corporate deduction for employees' health insurance (worth $99 billion) could be eliminated.
In addition, Professor Slemrod said, a simpler system could be harder on low-income people. "There's a trade-off of progressivity and the cost the tax system imposes," he said. Though a flat tax might convey some economic gains, he said, the social value of a progressive tax system might also be substantial.
So, true simplification may be a long way off, despite the proposals being floated in Washington. In pursuing their economic agenda, Mr. Steuerle said, Republicans have "actually proposed more complication in the midst of their proposals for simplification."
Even a radical restructuring is unlikely to take the form of a "pure" income or sales tax.
"Once you start cluttering up the system," Mr. Rudman said, "you're back to where you started." Even with a supposedly flat income tax, he added, "it's no longer flat, it's slightly hilly."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR STANDOFF; 
U.S. Bombers on Alert to Deploy As Warning to the North Koreans

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has put 24 long-range bombers on alert for possible deployment within range of North Korea, both to deter "opportunism" at a moment when Washington is focused on Iraq and to give President Bush military options if diplomacy fails to halt North Korea's effort to produce nuclear weapons, officials said today.
 The White House insisted today that Mr. Bush was still committed to a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Any decision to bolster the considerable American military presence near North Korea was simply what Ari Fleischer, the president's spokesman, called making "certain our contingencies are viable." 
 Mr. Rumsfeld, who Pentagon officials emphasized had not yet made a decision to send the bombers, was acting on a request for additional forces from Adm. Thomas B. Fargo, the Pacific commander, who concluded that North Korea's race to produce a nuclear weapon had significantly worsened the risks on the Korean Peninsula. 
"This puts them on a short string," said a senior Pentagon official, who explained that the aircraft and crews were now ready to move out within a set number of hours should they receive the final deployment order. 
The additional bomber force, which would be sent to Guam from bases in the United States along with surveillance planes, brings a potent capability to the region should Mr. Bush decide that he cannot allow North Korea to begin reprocessing its nuclear fuel into weapons.
The Pentagon's new alert status came as the International Atomic Energy Agency said it would meet on Feb. 12, in an emergency session, to declare North Korea in breach of its commitments under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and refer the issue to the United Nations Security Council. Administration officials said today that they would seek a resolution there condemning North Korea, but that they would not take the next step -- asking for economic sanctions or isolation of the country. 
At the same time, administration officials, in private briefings to members of Congress, have confirmed that North Korea appears to be moving spent nuclear spent-fuel rods that have been in storage since 1994.
If reprocessed into plutonium, those rods would provide the raw material for upwards of a half dozen weapons -- about one a month once the reprocessing plant is in full operation, experts say. That gives Mr. Bush a window of what one senior official said today was "a few weeks to a few months to decide if he wants to do something about Yongbyon," the nuclear complex, before the plutonium production is under way, and any military strike would risk spreading radioactive pollution around the Korean Peninsula. 
Both White House and Pentagon officials insisted there were no current plans to attack the Yongbyon nuclear facility, the center of North Korea's plutonium project. 
But the forward deployment to Guam would cut the bombers' flying time to the Korean Peninsula, and consideration of the move suggests that the Pentagon and the White House are concerned that they may need more power on short notice, even as many forces ordinarily based in the Pacific have been sent to the Middle East. 
"We are clearly engaged in a discussion about what is appropriate should we find ourselves engaged in executing a military operation in Iraq," said one senior Defense Department official. "We want to make sure we have sufficient forces in place in the Korean Peninsula area to deter any opportunism."
The dozen B-52 bombers and another dozen B-1 bombers could certainly help the 37,000 American troops defending South Korea deter an attack from North Korea across the demilitarized zone. But American commanders in South Korea have long argued they already have sufficient forces to deter such an attack, or at least hold their ground until reinforcements could arrive. 
There was no discussion, senior Pentagon officials said, about significant additions to American troops now based in South Korea.
The White House has never publicly discussed the possibility of attacking the reprocessing plant, and Mr. Bush has repeatedly said the United States "has no intention of invading North Korea." 
But that is a carefully formulated statement, leaving open the possibility that a North Korean move to produce weapons could force Mr. Bush to consider the advice of several leading Republican national security experts, who have argued that Mr. Bush cannot permit North Korea to have a significant nuclear arsenal.
"It's fair to say that there is a broad assumption in the administration now that Kim Jong Il is out to produce his weapons as fast as he can," said one senior official involved in the debate, referring to the North Korean leader. "We hope they can be dissuaded by diplomacy, pressure from us and from China and from Russia. But there are no guarantees any of that will work." 
Admiral Fargo is considering repositioning some jet fighters already under his jurisdiction within the Pacific Command to bases closer to the Korean Peninsula, Pentagon officials said. The bombers under consideration would be a large addition to the Pacific Command arsenal. 
Each B-1 bomber can carry up to two dozen one-ton, satellite-guided bombs. The payload of the giant B-52 is 70,000 pounds of bombs and missiles.
In addition, the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, now off the coast of Japan, remains available to Admiral Fargo. However, even before the current crisis with North Korea, the Kitty Hawk had been mentioned as the likely candidate should a fifth aircraft carrier be assigned to waters off Iraq. In that event, officials said, the Carl Vinson, now on the West Coast, would sail across the Pacific to take the place of the Kitty Hawk so that one aircraft carrier would always be in the region.
"It is standard practice for us to review our defensive posture for existing security commitments when U.S. forces are preparing for potential operations elsewhere in the world," said Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman on Asia-Pacific issues. "Such planning could result in the movement of forces, but only as a prudent measure to ensure that we maintain our ability to rapidly respond to contingencies if needed."
Thus, the Pentagon is challenged with how to balance several competing interests.
The military must continue carrying out deployments to Iraq -- including thousands of marines based in California who otherwise await orders for contingencies throughout the Pacific -- while making sure that other forces are put into place to deter North Korea.
Yet those new deployments must be crafted so they do not increase tensions in the region while diplomacy is given a chance.
"It's a very, very fine line," said one administration official.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE OVERVIEW; 
Bush's $2.2 Trillion Budget Proposes Record Deficits

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3 

 BODY:
President Bush sent Congress a $2.23 trillion budget today -- with record deficits -- that would speed up billions of dollars in income tax cuts, provide huge increases for the Pentagon and offer a modest jump in spending for NASA.
 Mr. Bush's budget forecasts a deficit of $304 billion in the current fiscal year, and projects a deficit of $307 billion for the 2004 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Over the next five years the total projected deficit would be more than $1 trillion, a potentially problematic number for Mr. Bush, who as a presidential candidate vowed that he could both cut taxes and eliminate the national debt. 
 In his budget message to Congress, the president said his budget reflected his most urgent national priorities: "Winning the war against terrorism, securing the homeland and generating long-term economic growth." 
The budget included no projection of the cost of any war with Iraq, which administration officials have said could be as low as $50 billion and as high as $200 billion. If there is a conflict, officials said, Mr. Bush would ask Congress for the money as an emergency supplement.
The budget calls for cuts in a wide range of domestic spending, including trims in Justice Department programs on juvenile delinquency and tribal courts and a halt in financing for the hiring of police officers. Money for a public housing program and aid to rural schools also would be cut. Over time, government-financed child care and children's health insurance would be reduced.
Democrats immediately attacked the White House for the deficits and what they called the most fiscally irresponsible budget in decades.
"The president's budget is worse than a bad movie that no one wants to see twice," Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, said in a statement distributed by his office. "It's a budget-busting epic disaster."
Administration officials just as quickly dismissed such concerns. 
"A balanced budget is a high priority for this administration," said Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, in a briefing for reporters today. "It is not the top or the only priority." 
The president's top priority, Mr. Daniels said, was protecting the country from terrorist attack. As a reflection of that, he said, the administration was requesting $41 billion for domestic security and $380 billion for defense, an increase of 4.2 percent beyond what was already the biggest military buildup since the administration of Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Bush, in his budget message to Congress, attributed the deficits to the costs of the campaign against terrorism, calling it "a war we did not choose" and a recession that started in early 2001. "My administration firmly believes in controlling the deficit and reducing it as the economy strengthens and our national security interests are met," he said. 
Mr. Daniels asserted that the $300 billion deficit, representing 2.7 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, was not large enough in percentage terms to cause trouble or to raise interest rates -- an assertion that Democrats and some budget analysts called outrageous.
"Mitch Daniels has proved once again that he is first and foremost a political operative and not a budget director," said Robert Greenstein, the executive director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. "I can think of few budget directors in recent history who would have made such astounding statements."
Mr. Greenstein said that the current deficits, while relatively small, were a threat to the near future, when a tidal wave of retiring baby boomers will tax the ailing Medicare and Social Security systems. 
Mr. Bush's budget, a five-inch stack of five paperback volumes weighing more than 13 pounds, also details his proposals for increases in education and AIDS programs. It is filled with cheerful pictures of children lining up for school lunches and of a newkindergarten in Afghanistan supported by the Agency for International Development, prompting Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, to brand it a press release.
"What Congress received today is pure P.R. with color pictures of little children and brave soldiers designed to distract the American public from the truth," Mr. Rangel said. 
The truth, Mr. Rangel said, was that the president's proposed $670 billion economic package, which proposes the elimination of the tax individuals pay on stock dividends as well as the acceleration of planned income tax cuts, was running up the debt for a future generation to pay.
Mr. Bush's budget sets aside $400 billion over the next 10 years to overhaul Medicare, and offers a photograph of the president framed by a large backdrop of a "Strengthening Medicare" sign from a recent event. But the budget offers no significant new details on how Mr. Bush will change the program. 
It also does not answer the fundamental question, which administration officials have so far declined to answer, of whether the elderly will have to leave their fee-for-service Medicare plans for health maintenance organizations to get insurance coverage for prescription drugs.
The NASA budget, normally little noticed by people outside of aeronautics, drew intense attention today. The president proposed that NASA financing should grow by nearly $500 million to $15.5 billion, an increase that White House officials said was in place before the space shuttle Columbia ripped apart on Saturday. Financing for the space shuttle program, which included four orbiters until the loss of Columbia, would increase to $3.9 billion from $3.2 billion.
Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said it was too soon to say whether Mr. Bush would ask Congress for more money to build another shuttle. But Mr. Daniels said that Mr. Bush's budget made it clear that the president was committed to moving forward in space.
"If there is a lesson in the last couple of days, I suppose it is another sad example that more money alone can't always avoid very sad setbacks," Mr. Daniels said.
NASA did come under fiscal scrutiny in the budget for the cost of the International Space Station now orbiting Earth. In a volume of the budget titled "Performance and Management Assessments," NASA was taken to task for billions of dollars in cost overruns for the station and given a rating of "Results Not Demonstrated" for the program. 
"This assessment indicates that the space station program has improved cost controls but also indicates that it is still too early to tell whether management reforms will continue to be successful," the report said.
The performance assessment volume is new this year, and is part of a Bush management initiative that tries to make government more cost-effective. The book rates major government programs, giving them grades like "effective," "moderately effective" and "adequate," with "ineffective" as the worst.
Eleven programs received "ineffective" ratings, among them Even Start, a literacy program that provides federal grants to states for adult and early childhood education for low-income families. 
"National evaluations show the program to have no impact on the children and parents served by Even Start," the report said. None of three studies have found, the report said, "that either children or parents who received services made greater school readiness gains or educational gains than those who did not receive Even Start services."
The budget recommended continued financing for children and parents already in the program, and proposed cutting its budget from $250 million in 2002 to $175 million in 2004.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE OUTLAYS; 
From Fuel Cell Cars to Slaughterhouse Inspection: Where the Money Goes

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

 BODY:
Departments of Energy, Interior and Environment
The administration would spend $30.4 billion on environmental and natural resources programs in 2004, an increase of 4 percent over last year's figure of $29.4 billion. But Wesley Warren, an environmental economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, noted that it was less than the $31.1 billion enacted in 2002. 
 President Bush's programs for energy and environment-related matters reflect somewhat contradictory goals. Some of them try to push the country toward less dependence on foreign oil, by encouraging drilling for oil in Alaska and researching technologies for hydrogen-powered fuel-cell cars. But the budget for research and development into energy-saving technologies would drop to $588 million in 2004 from $660 million in 2002. 
 Similarly, while the budget would extend tax credits for energy-saving cars, it also would extend deductions for bigger sport-utility vehicles.
The budget relies on $2.4 billion in revenue from leasing tracts in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil companies beginning in 2005. But the Senate has not approved drilling there, and six Republicans said last week that they opposed it, leaving its approval in doubt.
The proposed budget for the Environmental Protection Agency is $7.63 billion, a $10 million increase from last year's request but a reduction from $8.1 billion in 2002. The decrease is chiefly the result of cuts in clean-water programs.
The E.P.A. budget sets aside $7.7 million for the president's Clear Skies program to fight air pollution from power plants by 2015, and includes a $150 million increase to hasten the cleanup of Superfund sites. This increase should allow for the cleanup of 10 to 15 new sites, the administration said.
President Bush's request for $10.7 billion for the Interior Department is the largest in department history. It includes $699 million to reduce underbrush and combat forest fires. But environmental groups said it cut money for land acquisition and did not keep pace with national parks' maintenance needs. KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

HEADLINE: In Piedmont, a New Landscape for Barolo 

BYLINE:  By ERIC ASIMOV 

DATELINE: BAROLO, Italy 

 BODY:
WINTER in Piedmont is an unchanging tableau of mists rising over rolling hills faded to pale shades of green, brown and straw. Switchback roads climb past ancient farmhouses, toward hilltop towns crowned by castles. Everywhere, crisscrossing the bowl-shaped valleys, are vineyards. Though they seem bare in January, no more than masses of gnarled wood in various stages of pruning, it's easy to see the regional hierarchy of vines. The cooler areas, where the snow lingers the longest, are planted with lesser grapes, like dolcetto and barbera. The choice areas, where the snow has melted in the warmth of the sunshine, are reserved for nebbiolo, the great grape of Barolo.
 Despite the placid countryside, Piedmont has been bitterly divided for the last few decades between those who have sought to preserve traditional methods of making Barolo and innovators who have adapted new technology and methods in an effort to build new markets for their wines. 
 The division is part of a philosophical debate that has resounded all over the winemaking world, wherever critical praise, connoisseurship and status-seeking have stoked the demand for high-priced bottles. The debate has been heard in Bordeaux, where old-line producers express resentment over wines that they feel are tailored to the influential tastes of the wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr. It's echoed in Spain, in California and in Tuscany, where inky, concentrated wines of great potency have inspired both hosannas and complaints that once-singular wine styles are becoming homogenized. 
But here in Piedmont, where winemakers practically trip over one another daily in brightly lighted trattorias or espresso bars, the debate has special resonance. Unlike pinot noir and chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon and merlot, grapes that have produced great wines around the world, nebbiolo refuses to flourish anywhere but in this corner of northwestern Italy, almost within the embrace of France. Barolo, produced here in the hilly heart of the Langhe region, is known for power derived from tannins rather than from concentrated fruit flavors. In its youth, classic Barolo was austere and unyielding, but as it aged the tannins turned graceful and elegant, releasing gorgeous, earthy flavors often described as tar, licorice, truffles, violets and roses. 
While no one doubted the allure of classic Barolo, it was still largely unknown outside Italy in the 1960's and 70's. What's more, only a small amount of great Barolo was produced each year. More of it was overpoweringly tannic, even oxidized.
"The best Barolo is not easy to begin with," said Angelo Gaja, the superstar winemaker who joined his father's wine business in Barbaresco, just east of here, in 1962. "The idea of the so-called new-style wines was to see if it was possible to reach new consumers and have a big success."
The urge to make Barolo more modern set off a debate that was not merely about wine but about issues of culture, identity and heritage. And yet, while winemakers in other areas almost glory in their intransigence, the winemakers of Barolo in the last few years have moved ever so slowly toward reconciliation. Perhaps it's the great good feelings spawned by an unprecedented succession of great vintages from 1995 through 2001. Or maybe it's the growing market for Barolo, with production rising sharply from about 6.2 million bottles in 1996 to about 8.2 million in 2000. But the urgency that once split Barolo into warring camps seems to be gradually melting.
"Modern and traditional wines started coming together in '98 and '99," said Aldo Vaira at his plain modern winery in Vergne, a hillside hamlet overlooking the sloping rooftops of the little town of Barolo. Mr. Vaira, whose Barolos are taut with tannin yet as fragrant as Burgundies, calls himself a modern traditionalist. "Before, it was almost religious; you were either a modernist or a traditionalist," he said. "Now, good sense is prevailing. We are listening to the wines rather than to the fashions."
For years you could start a fight in Barolo merely by uttering a word like barrique, the widely used French term for the small oak barrels adopted by the modernists, or botti, the big traditional barrels that were branded by some as the source of unclean wines. But nowadays, in little Barolo towns like Serralunga d'Alba, La Morra and Castiglione Falletto, everybody is speaking the same language. In the chill of the cellars, whether surrounded by nut-brown 10,000-liter botti, or sleek, pale barriques that hold 225 liters, they cite the importance of reducing grape yields and of making balanced, elegant wines rather than fat, showy wines intended to impress critics at tastings. It may be no more than talk -- but the vocabulary of what's acceptable has changed. 
The big Barolo debate gathered strength in the 1980's as a cultural revolution swept the region. Until the middle of the 20th century, winemakers customarily sold their wine in bulk to restaurants or merchants who bottled it themselves. Only a few people, like Bartolo Mascarello and Giacomo Conterno, bottled wines from their own grapes. It was difficult work -- winemaking had not yet been anointed a lifestyle -- and many young people forsook agriculture for the factories of Turin or Milan.
In the 1970's and 80's, the bottom dropped out of the local economy, leaving many growers with nowhere to sell their grapes. Some decided to make and bottle their own wines, giving rise to a new generation of Barolo makers. Seeking new markets for their wines, many of them began to examine, and adapt, methods used to make the fruity, approachable wines that the rest of the world found so appealing.
Using temperature-controlled tanks, they shortened fermentation times, reducing the period in which the grape juice was in contact with tannin-bearing skins and seeds. To compensate, they aged the wine in the small oak barriques. These wines gained structure not from firm grape tannins but from more supple oak tannins. If the barriques were made of new oak, the wine gained distinct vanilla flavors, too. 
"One of the things that helped us was to go out in the world to see what kinds of wines were really valued," said Marco Parusso, whose family started to bottle its own wines in the mid-1980's under his father's name, Armando Parusso. 
Mr. Parusso, whose wines have been highly praised by Mr. Parker and other critics, is a flag-bearer of the modern style, devoted to barriques. "Purity comes from new wood," he said over a lunch of salt cod with capers and braised capon at a little restaurant in the center of Monforte d'Alba. "You need good technology and an open mind."
Such talk is still heresy to the ardent traditionalists, who feel that what the rest of the world wants in wine is irrelevant to the making of Barolo. No winemaker is more wrapped in traditionalism than Bartolo Mascarello, 77. Sitting behind a desk in the study of his modest house in Barolo, he repeats the mantra that sums up his position: "No barrique, no California, no cabernet, no chardonnay, no wines with made-up names." 
"I'm loyal to the traditions of my father and grandfather," he said, caressing a bottle of 1989 Mascarello with slender fingers curled with arthritis. "I don't want to lose them to make wine as they make it in Australia and Chile and Sicily."
Mr. Mascarello's time may have come again. After years in the critical wilderness, eclipsed by the modernists, his '98 Barolo was awarded the highest rating in the 2003 edition of the influential Gambero Rosso guide to Italian wines. Many in Piedmont view this as the guide's effort to call new attention to traditional styles after years of championing the modernists.
Mr. Mascarello has handed over the winemaking reins to his steadfast daughter, Maria-Teresa, who can't help expressing some bitterness at the direction in which the modernists have taken Barolo. "We were criticized and attacked by people who wanted to promote barriques," she recounted. "The press would speak well of them and attack us as people who couldn't keep up with the times, who made dirty wines from filthy wood. Now, they want to make wines like us."
Once started, the words tumble out: "Now, it's trendy to talk about terroir, but they have barriques, roto-fermenters and other things. Where's the identity?"
Without a doubt it's in the wine. At an osteria in La Morra, she opened a magnum of '64 Mascarello, an unforgettable wine full of signature aromas of tar, truffles and tobacco and yet as fresh as a wine 30 years younger. It went beautifully with local delicacies like tajarin, a delicate egg pasta drizzled with minced pork and veal, and juicy wild boar with oregano. 
The Mascarellos and Mr. Parusso today represent the extremes in Barolo making, but most producers have staked out positions in the middle. The succession of fine vintages and the critical acclaim in the last decade have all served to make winemaking in the Piedmont a profitable business, at least judging from the number of Barolo producers who are building stylish new additions to their wineries.
"Different interpretations in making Barolo have helped enormously in making Barolo known," said Mr. Gaja, who is building a hotel in an old castle across the street from his winery in Barbaresco.
At Rocche dei Manzoni in Monforte d'Alba, Valentino Migliorini is constructing a veritable temple to his wines, complete with marble, murals, niches, archways and columns. Luciano Sandrone in Barolo has just completed a spacious new winery near the renowned Cannubi vineyard, while Enrico Scavino, whose family owns the Paolo Scavino winery, is in the middle of a major expansion, practically taking apart a hill to install a cellar within. Each of these producers makes Barolos that might be considered the best of both worlds, using combinations of new and old techniques to achieve wines of great purity and balance.
Perhaps nothing indicates the recent changes in Barolo as much as the sight of a cathedral-like structure rising over an old castle, which is to be the new winery and visitor center of Famiglia Anselma. Made of old bricks, oak beams and building stones recovered from crumbling structures all over Piedmont, the winery will be the first in the region to offer the sort of guided tours and conference amenities that are taken for granted in the Napa Valley.
"We looked at wineries all over California for ideas," said Maurizio Anselma, whose parents, Renato and Giovanna, acquired prime land in the Barolo territory at a time in the 1980's when land could be had for a pittance. "The future is total transparency between consumer and producer."
Mr. Anselma, who is 24, tends to speak in mystical terms of his vision of Barolo, of creating a winery that, like Dickens's ghosts, epitomizes Barolo's past, present and future. His mother, Giovanna, who oversees the family's vineyards, takes care of practical concerns. She hears the jargon about cutting yields and shakes her head.
"Yields are a concept that people don't understand," she said. "They don't know whether a vine is suited for five bunches or for two, so they're afraid and cut it back to two. It's like having a Ferrari and only going 30 miles per hour."
Perhaps no winemaker in Piedmont, or in all of Italy, can match the success or prescience of Mr. Gaja. Yet, though he has been branded the foremost modernist in Piedmont, he has never completely abandoned the techniques of his father. Mr. Gaja ferments his wines for up to 30 days, the old-fashioned way, rather than the five-day fermentations of the new wave, and, though he uses barriques for the first year of aging -- only one-third of them new -- he finishes the wines in big botti, some 60 years old.
"I don't agree there is a coming back to the old style," he said, typically provocative. "The old style is different than it was 30 years ago. Now, there is a wider spectrum, and it is quite good."

HEADLINE: G.E. Buying British Consumer Loan Operation 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Abbey National, a big British bank, said today that it had agreed to sell most of its consumer lending division to General Electric of the United States for $1.4 billion in cash, to focus on providing consumers with checking and saving accounts, credit cards and mortgages.
 The division, known as First National, makes subprime mortgage loans and home improvement loans and finances large consumer purchases. First National also makes car loans and sells liability insurance, but those operations were not part of the sale. Abbey National said it was considering its options for those businesses. 
 Since Luqman Arnold took charge as Abbey National's chief executive in October, the bank has been reviewing its operations, aiming to step back from riskier businesses like corporate lending and bond underwriting. The bank is set to provide an update on that process, including further write-downs on some of those businesses, when it reports its 2002 financial results Feb. 26.
Most analysts expect Abbey National to continue selling or closing peripheral and underperforming businesses, a process some see as preparation for an outright sale of the bank to a rival. 
"Luqman wants to restructure the bank, and then maybe sell it," said Ben Ritchie of Aberdeen Asset Management. 
Mr. Ritchie expects all the units not directly related to retail banking to go on the block. That includes the car-loan and liability insurance operations of First National, the ones General Electric did not agree to buy; a portfolio of investments, including some junk bonds; railroad and aircraft leasing arms; and a project finance division. 
But a quick sale or merger of Abbey National with a rival is unlikely, analysts said, even though the bank was approached in recent months by the National Australia Bank and the Bank of Ireland; both were rebuffed. The analysts say that to try to ensure he got the best terms for his shareholders, Mr. Arnold would want to fix Abbey's problems before he considers any deal. The problems stem mainly from a heady expansion into high-risk lending during the bull market. 
Moreover, a combination with any of the large British banks, like the merger the Lloyd TSB Group proposed in 2001, would probably run afoul of regulators, analysts said. Antitrust officials blocked the Lloyd deal because they judged that the combined banks would have too large a share of the market for checking and saving accounts and wield too much power in lending to small businesses. Abbey National has no plans now to scale back in either area. 
Abbey National shares fell 2.2 percent today, to $:4.09 ($6.74) in London trading. General Electric shares fell 60 cents, to $23.05.
For General Electric, the purchase of First National expands its reach into familiar territory at a time when concerns about consumer credit in Britain are reaching a fever pitch. Most analysts now acknowledge that the housing market is experiencing a bubble fueled by very low interest rates, and consumers have gone on spending prolifically even as the overall economy has begun to slow. 
"One would rightly be concerned about credit risk," said David Hochstim of Bear, Stearns & Company. "But these are businesses that G.E. has a lot of familiarity with." 
Since entering the European consumer finance market in 1990, the company's GE Consumer Finance unit has branched into three areas: car loans, home mortgages and private-label credit cards. The company has made several acquisitions, including the iGroup, a home mortgage broker, in 2001, and Time Retail Finance, which provides in-store financing for large consumer purchases, in 2002. 
"The acquisition of First National is right in our sweet spot," said Ivan Royle, a G.E. spokesman. 
G.E. is paying $:218 million ($359 million) more for the First National businesses than the units' net tangible assets are worth, a price most analysts considered fair. G.E. could also owe a further $:42 million if First National meets certain performance targets. For the first half of 2002, First National's profits fell 13 percent, to $:54 million, compared with $:62 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Cost-Cutting Lets Daimler Post Profit 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Reaping the benefits of a stringent cost-cutting at its troubled Chrysler division, DaimlerChrysler of Germany said today that it had swung from a net loss to a profit in the fourth quarter and for all of 2002.
 While Daimler's results provided fresh evidence of stabilization at its Chrysler division in the United States, they still fell somewhat short of the expectations of industry analysts. The company also deflated shareholders by announcing a 50 percent increase in its dividend, rather than the doubling that many investors had expected. 
 DaimlerChrysler's shares slumped 4.25 percent in Frankfurt trading. The company's American depository receipts fell 88 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $30.61 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
"You could say it was a mild disappointment," said Thomas C. Aney, an automobile analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein. "But the only really hard number here is the dividend."
Mr. Aney noted that DaimlerChrysler had reported results for the entire group, which also makes trucks and buses and sells financial services, and did not break out figures for individual divisions, making the performance of the Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz divisions difficult to assess beyond general trends.
Still, he and other analysts said the company had clearly put Chrysler on the road to recovery. The process was painful, involving 26,000 layoffs and the closing of six factories. But Chrysler has stuck by a forecast that it will turn an operating profit of at least 2 billion euros this year.
"They've been able to show the numbers so far," Mr. Aney said. "It's a really good achievement on the part of management."
For the fourth quarter, DaimlerChrysler, which is based in Stuttgart, reported net income of 168 million euros ($181 million), in contrast to a net loss of 39 million euros a year earlier.
For all of 2002, the company reported net income of 4.72 billion euros ($5.1 billion), in contrast to a loss of 662 million euros in 2001.
Net profit for 2002 was bolstered by one-time gains that totaled roughly $1 billion for the year.
In contrast, the losses in 2001 included more than $2.6 billion in extraordinary charges, primarily related to the overhaul of Chrysler.
The challenge for the company will be sustaining Chrysler's recovery in a fiercely competitive American market that has been darkened by economic weakness and fears of a war. Auto sales dropped 2 percent in the United States in January, while Chrysler sales tumbled by 12 percent.
Analysts said Chrysler, like other carmakers, relied on costly incentives to pump up sales in the fourth quarter of 2002. Chrysler plans to introduce several new models this year.
"The acid test is still to come," said Graeme Maxton, an analyst at Autopolis, a consulting firm in London. "You're moving into a market in which the industry, as a rule, will be horribly unprofitable."
DaimlerChrysler's luxury line, Mercedes-Benz, has buoyed the company in the United States, reporting a 3.7 percent rise in sales last month. Sales of the E-class sedan jumped 42 percent. But the rise of the euro versus the dollar will make the cars more expensive in the United States.
Mercedes also faces headwinds at home. The German economy is on the brink of a recession, as consumers refuse to spend. While Mercedes remains a gilded brand, BMW has cultivated a younger, sportier image that it believes will allow it to leapfrog Mercedes as the world's biggest luxury carmaker.
"Mercedes has done quite well, given the exchange rate," Mr. Maxton said. "The problem is that its two key markets are slowing."
DaimlerChrysler gave Dieter Zetsche, the German head of Chrysler, a strong vote of confidence last week, extending his contract for five years. The move was part of a shake-up of its management board that will leave the company with only one American on its core senior executive team.
Gary C. Valade, a former Chrysler executive in charge of worldwide purchasing, will step down from his post at DaimlerChrysler at the end of this year. Two German executives, Klaus Mangold and Manfred Bischoff, will also leave the board. The lone American on the 11-member committee will be Thomas W. Sidlik, who heads purchasing in the United States and will assume Mr. Valade's duties.
A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, Thomas Frohlich, insisted that the changes did not foretell an even greater German domination of the company. He noted that the chairman, Jurgen Schrempp, has said he could see an American taking over from Mr. Zetsche at Chrysler.
Given the thorny challenges ahead, it is not clear investors are all that concerned about the nationality of the top management. 
"You can take two views of it," Mr. Maxton said. "One, that this was a takeover wrongly advertised as a merger. Or two, that Germans are simply better at running car companies than Americans."

HEADLINE: Pataki's Budget Would Cut City's Prekindergarten Programs 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
Six years ago, in flusher economic times, Gov. George E. Pataki signed off on an ambitious plan to offer prekindergarten to all of New York State's 4-year-olds by 2002.
 Though it missed that deadline and has withheld much of the promised money for the program, the state has nudged closer each year to meeting its goal: nearly 60,000 children are now enrolled in prekindergarten programs financed by the plan, including 44,000 in New York City. But Mr. Pataki's new budget would eliminate universal prekindergarten financing, potentially wiping out hundreds of programs. In the city, it would curtail or shutter programs in middle-class and poor neighborhoods alike. 
 Faced with an $11.5 billion budget gap, Mr. Pataki wants to slash the state education budget by $1.2 billion, including the entire $204 million allotment for prekindergarten. About $145 million of that goes to New York City, whose public prekindergarten programs are run both by schools and by nonprofit groups. 
Parents and educators say prekindergarten has become indispensable as academic standards rise and children are expected to pass standardized tests by the third grade. Many prekindergarten students in the city come from immigrant families, and the programs help them learn English. 
"People still think of prekindergarten centers as cute little optional places," said Janice McGuire, executive director of the Hudson Guild, a community group in Chelsea that runs a combined day care and prekindergarten program for 165 children. "But it's not nonessential to get kids speaking English before they enter kindergarten."
Though the state aid pays for only 2 1/2 hours of prekindergarten a day, Hudson Guild's program runs from 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., using a combination of Head Start, day care, universal prekindergarten and other financial aid. If Hudson Guild lost its $300,000 in state prekindergarten money -- roughly 20 percent of its program budget -- the program would keep running but many children could no longer stay all day, Ms. McGuire said. 
The cut would be more dire for prekindergarten programs that operate in schools, many of which depend entirely on state aid. Those programs could close altogether, said Nancy Kolben, the executive director of Child Care Inc., a referral agency. 
State prekindergarten aid has helped Hudson Guild hire a curriculum specialist, put computers in every classroom and take students on field trips. The local school district, District 2, helps with lesson planning, letting the program know how to prepare children for kindergarten. 
Though the atmosphere is more playful than academic, each class has a reading lesson every day and practices writing and counting. Students also cook, sing, dance, do puzzles and art projects and conduct science experiments. 
One teacher, Iris VanLeuvan, is teaching lessons on Antarctica this month; next month will be dinosaurs.
"The assumption these days is that children will start school with some academic skills," Ms. McGuire said, "and if they don't get it here, I don't know where they're going to get it."
Before the state began paying for universal prekindergarten in 1997, New York City provided only limited programs for 4-year-olds, and only in its poorest school districts. The state-financed program has grown from 14,000 city students in 1998 to 44,000 today -- about 40 percent of the city's 110,000 4-year-olds, Ms. Kolben said.
Since many schools do not have room for prekindergarten classes, about 70 percent of the programs operate out of community centers like Hudson Guild. Parents can also use the money to subsidize tuition at private nursery schools.
Mr. Pataki's budget would also cut the entire $89 million that New York City receives from the state for class-size reduction in kindergarten through third grade. Since 1997, the money has allowed city schools to lower class size to 20 in kindergarten and 25 in first through third grades. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said the cut will require 1,900 teachers to be reassigned or laid off. 
Ms. Kolben said the prekindergarten cut could affect an additional 3,300 teachers in school and community-based programs. She said studies suggest that children who attend prekindergarten are 50 percent less likely to need special education and 25 percent less likely to be held back in third grade. 
Beverly Berry, whose youngest son attends the prekindergarten program at Public School 37 in Springfield Gardens, Queens, said prekindergarten was especially important to working parents who would otherwise have to leave their 4-year-olds with baby sitters. 
"It's someplace where the kids can learn instead of watching TV or playing in someone's house," she said. "At the baby sitter's, they wouldn't be sitting down and learning the A B C's."

 BODY:
The pressures weakening the commercial property market here were illustrated by the largest lease negotiated last year.
 PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting concern, agreed to take 300,000 square feet at a prime downtown tower, 125 High Street. But starting in October, it will vacate 400,000 square feet in three nearby buildings. This leaves the office market with 100,000 square feet more space available than was occupied, a phenomenon called net negative absorption. This comes as 13 buildings, with a total of 3.7 million square feet of space, were completed in 2002 or are under construction. 
 This deal makes sense for the tenant, which recently sold parts of the company and trimmed staff to about 2,150 from 2,600, a 17 percent cut in its Boston jobs. The new quarters are walking distance from most clients and offer extensive services for rent in the range of $40 a square foot annually, compared with the mid-$80's for comparable space at the market peak two years ago. 
"We're very happy to lock in these rents for the next 12 years," said Michael J. Costello, the PricewaterhouseCoopers managing partner here.
But for the Boston area's commercial real estate market, this deal adds to the combination of space returning to the market, historic high vacancies and falling rents that have created the fastest, most severe market contraction on record, according to industry professionals.
In the region's 146-million-square-foot office market, the availability of space to lease or sublease was 22.3 percent by the end of the fourth quarter of 2002 versus 5.5 percent at the end of 2000, according to figures from Spaulding & Slye Colliers, a real estate services concern based in Boston and Washington. In the suburbs, office availability is the highest on record, 27 percent, versus 6.4 percent in 2000, and has climbed above 30 percent in some submarkets.
In the prime suburban location at the intersection of Route 128 and the Massachusetts Turnpike, 27 percent of the office space and 43.7 percent of the research and development space is available. In the strongest urban markets, Boston and Cambridge, the office availability is 15.9 percent and 22.1 percent, respectively, versus 4.5 percent and 4.8 percent in 2000. In Cambridge, a haven for high technology and life science companies, availability for research and development space is 26.5 percent, up from zero in 2000. Across the region, annual office asking rents now average about $28 a square foot, compared with $46 two years ago.
More startling still, 2002 ended with the eighth consecutive quarter of net negative absorption, leaving the region with a net decline of three million square feet in occupancy during the year. That added to the total stock of available office space, now 32.6 million square feet, according to Spaulding & Slye Colliers. 
The rising vacancies come amid layoffs by an array of businesses. By December, unemployment in Boston had doubled to 5.1 percent from 2.4 percent in December 2000, according to Elliot Winer, chief economist of the state Department of Employment and Training. 
"We're in a real estate recession," said William F. McCall, president of McCall & Almy, real estate advisers. "Unlike any other downturn since the 1940's, this wasn't caused by an excess of office supply but by contracting demand among companies that leased space anticipating growth and have had layoffs instead."
During the wrenching recession of the early 1990's, the region was awash with property foreclosures and bank failures, and unemployment hit 9.6 percent. But the availability rate rose only to 16.9 percent over all, 16.2 percent in Boston, 12.6 percent in Cambridge and 18.5 percent in the suburbs. Furthermore, 1991 was the only year with net negative absorption.
Now after eight negative quarters here, there is about 25 million square feet of available Class A and B offices in the Boston region, said Mr. McCall, who predicts another 2.5 million square feet of net negative absorption in 2003.
To return to a healthy commercial property market, the region should have 10 million to 13 million square feet available. "Since the market normally absorbs about three million square feet a year, and by 2004 there will be about 14 million square feet to absorb, we won't see a real rebound until 2008 or 2009," Mr. McCall said.
Raymond G. Torto, managing director of Torto Wheaton Research, a unit of CB Richard Ellis, has a similar outlook. "The economic sectors that were engines of growth in the 1990's -- law, finance, business services -- are announcing layoffs and imploding," he said.
Statewide in 2002, financial services lost about 3,000 jobs; in 1993, the first year of the recovery, it gained 3,200 jobs. Also last year, jobs fell 6 percent in high-technology manufacturing and 7.9 percent in business services. Unfortunately, the growth sectors -- health care at 1.4 percent and private education at 2.9 percent -- lease only about 2 percent of Boston's offices. The contracting financial, law and professional service firms lease about 68 percent.
In stark contrast to the bleak rental market, investors leery of the securities markets and lured by low interest rates are buying owner-occupied Boston office buildings at high prices and at an accelerating pace, said Jeffrey B. Swartz, principal director of capital markets for Spaulding & Slye Colliers. Of the owner-occupied buildings valued at more than $10 million that he tracks, three million square feet were sold last year in transactions valued at $425 million versus 1.5 million square feet and $175 million in 2001. To catch this wave, John Hancock is marketing its entire Boston portfolio, valued about $1 billion.
But there can be a downside to such corporate sales. "The sellers will consolidate space, eliminate jobs or move them elsewhere," said Stephen D. Lynch, managing director of Insignia/ESG here. For instance, on Dec. 26, MetLife sold a 560,000-square-foot building at 501 Boylston Street in the Back Bay section that it had entirely occupied for $122 million to Beacon Capital Partners. Starting in 2004, MetLife will lease only 200,000 square feet for five years, a relatively short term.
In the suburbs, such sales since 2000 by hard-hit high-technology and telecommunications companies like Lucent Technologies and 3Com have been followed by job cuts, said William Barrack, a principal at Spaulding & Slye Colliers. Last month the military contractor Raytheon, which has cut 942 jobs since 2000, sold the 360,000-square-foot Lexington, Mass., headquarters it had occupied since 1961 to move to a new 150,000-square-foot headquarters in Waltham, Mass.
Especially in Boston, "investors are missing the real estate fundamentals," Mr. McCall said.
"The rents don't support the prices they're paying," he said. "Without demand, rents will fall further, and most companies have enough space they already lease but don't use to grow 10 percent without new leases.
Over all, rents are still sliding. In Boston, Fidelity Investments, a unit of FMR and a major owner and tenant, is subleasing for $17.50 a square foot space it had rented in the mid-$40's. In suburban Billerica, Bull HN Information Systems is subleasing 70,000 square feet for zero rent, asking only for operating expenses, estimated at $8 a square foot, according to Peter Stavropulos, a company spokesman.
But the Boston market has a bright side. Some longtime tenants are renewing leases at strong rents rather than bargain hunting, noted Mr. Lynch of Insignia.
In Cambridge last year, the life sciences company Novartis leased 800,000 square feet of lab space to relocate its world research headquarters here, an investment of approximately $1 billion.
"That's a great statement of faith in the long-term fundamentals of this economy," said Joseph W. Haley, a real estate specialist with the law firm of Goodwin Procter who describes himself as an optimist. "But real estate grows when business grows and business is depressed, state revenues are depressed and major firms are still cutting jobs. The best hope for real over the next year or two is stabilization."

Shares Retreat as Investors Await U.N. Speech by Powell

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Increasingly anxious about a possible war with Iraq, investors unloaded stocks yesterday, collecting profits from two days of increases.
 Analysts said there was little reason to buy ahead of an address today before the United Nations by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. 
 "I just don't see anything right now that is going to improve investors' psychology about the market," said Richard A. Dickson, senior market strategist at Lowry's Research Reports in Palm Beach, Fla. "There is just so much uncertainty going on with the potential for war with Iraq." 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 96.53 points, or 1.2 percent, at 8,013.29. The Dow's loss wiped out more than half of the 164.69 points gained in the last two sessions after three weeks of heavy selling.
The broader market also retreated. The Nasdaq composite index fell 17.64 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,306.15. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 12.12 points, or 1.4 percent, to 848.20.
Wall Street was focused on Mr. Powell's appearance today before the Security Council, when he is expected to discuss new intelligence information on Iraq. Investors are worried that a war with Iraq would further undermine a sluggish economy, in which earnings continue to languish.
"Investors want to be told that all is clear in the world, and it is safe to get back into the markets, which, unfortunately, is not something investors can look forward to," said Jack Caffrey, equities strategist at J. P. Morgan Private Bank.
While the market historically lifts after military action begins, some analysts are skeptical that will happen this time.
"What if it is not quick and easy?" Mr. Dickson said.
Shares in Cisco Systems, the networking giant, declined 28 cents, to $13.20, ahead of its quarterly earnings. After the market closed, Cisco reported second-quarter profits that exceeded analysts' expectations by 2 cents a share. Still, shares fell in after-hours trading.
The American International Group, the commercial insurer, fell $3.63, to $51.70, after the company announced that it had increased its reserves to $3.5 billion, resulting in an after-tax charge of $1.8 billion.
And Oxford Health Plans, the provider of managed care, fell $2.18, to $32, on a downgrade from Salomon Smith Barney.
Gainers included the drugstore chain CVS, which rose $1.21, to $24.55, after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' forecasts by 2 cents a share and 2002 profits that were 3 cents a share greater than anticipated.

Treasury Prices Increase
(By Reuters) -- Treasury prices rose yesterday as the threat of war and a stock market slump sent investors running for bonds.
In a market torn between growing talk of war and the prospect of fresh government debt, a slide in stocks tipped the balance in favor of bonds.
"Our market seems to be very dependent on what stocks do, so any time there's some war worries, we go up a little," said Drew Forbes, head of government trading at Daiwa Securities. "We're just going to waffle around here until we get some sort of resolution." 
The price of a 10-year Treasury note rose 19/32, to 100 20/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.93 percent, from 4 percent on Monday.
The 30-year bond climbed 25/32, to 108 31/32. Its yield fell to 4.79 percent, from 4.84 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: DEFICITS; 
States' Budget Gaps Widen Nearly 50% in Two Months

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: DENVER, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Estimates of state budget deficits for the current fiscal year have grown by nearly 50 percent in two months, creating the worst fiscal outlook for states since World War II and prompting nearly half of them to consider raising taxes, a new survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures shows.
 The report calls the budget gaps "unprecedented," and says those projected for next year are even wider. 
 "Things are very, very bad for the states," the conference's president, State Senator Angela Monson of Oklahoma, said today in presenting the findings at a news conference in Washington. "Most legislators are seeing things now they cannot relate to. There has been nothing like this in recent history." 
The survey found that by the end of January, 36 states were projecting a combined budget gap of $25.7 billion for the current fiscal year, which for most ends on June 30, compared with projections of $17.5 billion in a November survey. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia reported no shortfalls; Tennessee provided no information for the latest survey by the nonpartisan conference, based here in Denver.
The outlook is even worse for the 2004 fiscal year. The survey found that 36 states, including some that did not expect a deficit for 2003, were cumulatively projecting that under current plans, revenue next year would fall short of spending by $68.5 billion -- a total likely to rise, because 11 other states and the District of Columbia said they had not yet made estimates. Only Arkansas, New Mexico and Wyoming predicted no shortfalls for 2004.
California has the bleakest outlook by far, with a projected gap of $26.1 billion in 2004, from $8.5 billion this fiscal year. New York is next, with a shortfall projected to grow to $9.3 billion from $2.5 billion, followed by New Jersey, $4.6 billion from $1.1 billion; Texas, $3.7 billion from $1.7 billion; and Illinois, $3.5 billion from $592 million.
The report blames the national economy's sluggishness, stock-market declines, downturns in both manufacturing and high-technology industries, and rising health care costs.
But Senator Monson said the federal government deserved some of the blame as well, for creating a new round of unfunded mandates -- programs that the government requires of the states but does not finance -- in domestic security, education and other areas. Ms. Monson estimated that the new mandates were costing states $25 billion, on top of the cost of old ones, like Medicaid, that are growing more expensive each year.
Twenty-four states are looking at new taxes to help close their budget gaps. Missouri is considering a tax surcharge on high-income earners. Gov. Kenny Guinn of Nevada has proposed new taxes on cigarettes, liquor, slot machines and gross business receipts. Idaho is one of six states considering an increase in sales taxes.
The deficits are also forcing states to cut programs, large and small. In the current fiscal year, the survey found, 9 states have reduced spending on elementary and secondary education, 13 on higher education, 13 on Medicaid benefits, and 9 on prison systems. Twenty-nine states have adopted cuts in every program.

HEADLINE: The Doctor Is Out in New Jersey 

 BODY:
The spectacle of thousands of physicians hitting the bricks this week in New Jersey is a sobering measure of doctors' fury at the rising costs of malpractice insurance. But their proposed solution of a $250,000 cap on pain-and-suffering litigation is far too simplistic a prescription as the doctors attempt to pressure the state government for a quick fix.
 The physicians have been careful to limit their strike to non-emergency care, and they have legitimate concerns about malpractice premiums, which have been spiking upward, reaching more than $100,000 for some specialists. They blame trial lawyers for obtaining "jackpot" awards of millions of dollars in non-economic damages from sympathetic juries. The trial lawyers, already demonized by President Bush in his demand for tight tort reform, insist the basic problem is that the insurance industry is allowed to compensate for heavy investment losses with carte blanche premium hikes on all doctors, good and bad. 
 Tort reform alone is hardly the answer, although it is worth considering as part of a package of other more critical changes. The insurance industry should be required to present the same sort of detailed justification for malpractice increases as is now required for auto insurance hikes. Right now, even reformers with the best intentions are short of information. Is a tiny minority of inept doctors responsible for more than half the malpractice problem, as lawyers contend? If so, attention should be directed at them rather than the legal system. Tort reform would be a solution only if the real problem is routinely excessive jury awards and a flood of nuisance claims, as doctors and insurers insist but the lawyers deny.
The state needs a commission to look beyond the rival propaganda. Clear information and honest compromise are needed in New Jersey, not some narrow demand wielded on a picket sign by physicians taking to the streets.

HEADLINE: Some Trades in S.&P. Futures Are Canceled After Odd Surge 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
More than $170 million in futures trades in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index were canceled late yesterday after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange concluded that a sudden spike that sent prices up almost 12 percent within seconds had occurred for no good reason.
 But many other trades that were well above market prices were allowed to stand, providing a windfall for some traders and significant losses for others. 
 Eric Wolff, the exchange's managing director for regulatory affairs, said it was not clear what had set off the move. "The rumors that somebody did something phenomenally stupid are probably wrong," he said. "It does not look like an idiot with a single order caused this event." 
Instead, he said, after the market began to move, many "buy stop" orders were activated. Such orders are typically entered by traders who short the market and want to cut their losses if prices begin to rally.
The big move began at 4:07:12 p.m., Eastern time, seven minutes after the New York Stock Exchange closed for the day with substantial losses but with a late rally that trimmed the decline. The big move ended 43 seconds later.
The action took place in trading in so-called mini contracts for the S.& P. 500, which are one-fifth the size of normal contracts and are intended to appeal to smaller investors. Each contract is worth 50 times the S.& P. index, or about $42,000 at current prices.
Within seconds, the price of the contract shot up from 847 to 948 and then fell back to 848. But the price of the larger S.& P. 500 contracts, which normally trade in tandem with the smaller ones, never rose above 854.
The exchange determined that all trades more than 6 points above 854 were clearly erroneous. So it canceled trades for about 4,000 contracts at prices of 860.25 and above.
But it allowed to stand trades for 398 contracts executed at prices above 854. Those contracts, valued at about $17 million, provided immediate gains for the sellers because the contract ended the day at 849.25.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Interpublic is making some headway with its financial problems as a deadline approaches.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AS a deadline nears for renegotiating loan agreements with banks, the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York seems to be making some progress in addressing its financial problems. The troubled agency company has received bids in the sale of a large division and is cutting costs through a merger of two of its agencies.
 In addition, talks with the banks appear to be going smoothly, with negotiations to amend Interpublic's credit agreements expected to be completed by Monday's deadline. 
 But in keeping with the recent pattern of one step forward and one or two back, the stock of Interpublic fell almost 7 percent yesterday. Shares dropped on a gloomy prognosis from an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities, Fred Searby, who reduced by 5.3 percent his estimates for earnings per share this year and downgraded his rating for Interpublic to underweight from neutral. 
In addition, Mr. Searby warned that there was an "excessive risk" of further declines in the price of Interpublic shares, which have plunged almost 66 percent from their 52-week high in April 2002. The stock has been under siege as the agency company, which owns units like Campbell-Ewald, Initiative Media and the McCann-Erickson World Group, has suffered through months of revenue shortfalls, reports of accounting irregularities and repeated reductions in earnings estimates, along with cuts in its debt ratings and the announcement of a formal inquiry into its finances by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Interpublic closed yesterday at $11.74, falling 87 cents, or 6.9 percent.
Interpublic executives shrugged off the report because, they said, it echoed the cautionary words already uttered by most analysts who follow Madison Avenue. The executives, needless to say, preferred to look ahead to what they described as more encouraging developments.
One involves the sale of the division, a research company known as the NFO WorldGroup, which Interpublic acquired almost three years ago for more than $600 million. Last month, Interpublic hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to "explore strategic alternatives" for NFO, which is corporate parlance for hanging a for-sale sign on the division. (Goldman, Sachs is also shopping the loss-plagued Octagon Motor Sports unit of Interpublic.)
Interpublic and Goldman, Sachs say they are pleased with the four bids received so far, estimated at up to $575 million, and a deal to sell NFO could be concluded in as soon as a week or two.
Executives who were briefed on the discussions confirmed reports by Reuters and the online edition of the trade publication Adweek that the bidders included three British companies: the Aegis Group, United Business Media and the WPP Group; WPP was the runner-up for NFO when it was sold in spring 2000.
The fourth bidder is "masked," as one executive said, adopting a mock cloak-and-dagger tone of voice.
In addition, the pending merger -- in which the New York office of Lowe & Partners Worldwide would absorb Bozell in New York -- seems to be progressing, subject to the usual caveat that the defections of major clients or talented executives could derail or spoil it.
The clients of Bozell "will move with us to Lowe," the chief executive at Bozell, Tom Bernardin, wrote in a memorandum to the agency's more than 350 employees. An exception is Bank of America, with estimated billings of $170 million out of Bozell's estimated total of more than $800 million.
Because Lowe works for a Bank of America competitor, HSBC, the Bank of America assignment "will be moving to another IPG agency," Mr. Bernardin wrote, referring to Interpublic by its stock-ticker symbol, as so many employees still do.
Adweek reported this week that the Bank of America account might be shifted to two other Interpublic agencies in New York, Deutsch and Gotham. Deutsch has a small direct-marketing assignment from a Bank of America rival, J. P. Morgan Chase, but that potential conflict would be relatively easy to resolve.
J. P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America -- along with HSBC -- are also among the many banks with which Interpublic is negotiating to amend its major credit agreements. The other banks include Bank of New York, Bank One, the Citibank unit of Citigroup, Fleet, ING, SunTrust and Wachovia.
The date to complete the negotiations, originally Jan. 15, was extended to Monday. In the meantime, Interpublic has agreed to take no dividend action as the talks continue and to limit its cash acquisitions.
Interpublic has $2.9 billion in debt and, as The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday, faces the possibility of refinancing a large convertible bond due in December, which could further reduce earnings.
Interpublic recently sent letters to clients, in response to concerned questions from a handful of them, that were intended to offer reassurance on issues like its liquidity and the strength of its balance sheet.
Interpublic is not the only troubled agency company that is seeking to sell assets. The Cordiant Communications Group in London confirmed yesterday what it declined to discuss last week, saying it was in "preliminary discussions regarding the possible sale of a stake in certain of its Australian operations."
Newspapers in Australia reported that Cordiant, which has been hurt by client defections and steep financial losses, was trying to sell its Australian holdings, including George Patterson Bates in Sydney, the largest agency in Australia, to Pacific Equity Partners.
Cordiant said that because the discussions were preliminary, "it is too early to state whether or not this will lead to a transaction." 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 6, 2003

 CORRECTION:
The Advertising column in Business Day yesterday about financial problems at the Interpublic Group of Companies misattributed an opinion about four bids that have been made for Interpublic's NFO WorldGroup division. Neither Interpublic nor its outside adviser, Goldman, Sachs & Company, commented on the offers. They did not say they were pleased with the bids.

HEADLINE: U.S. Factory Orders Increased 0.4% in December 

BYLINE:  By Dow Jones/AP

 BODY:
Demand for manufacturers' products increased in December, the Commerce Department said yesterday, with factory orders rising 0.4 percent over November, when orders fell 0.8 percent.
 Stronger demand for computers and household appliances more than offset weaker demand for cars and other transportation equipment. 
 "This is especially encouraging because, after all, manufacturing has been the hardest hit in the last couple of years," said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank, "and its recovery is thought to be central to an improving set of economic conditions in general." 
December's performance was slightly better than the 0.3 percent increase analysts were expecting.
For all of 2002, orders to American factories dropped 0.8 percent, which was an improvement over the 7.4 percent decline for 2001. Shipments, a barometer of demand, fell 1.1 percent last year, compared with a 5.5 percent drop for 2001.
Orders for all transportation products fell 2.7 percent in December after rising 0.7 percent in November, the agency said. That decline was led by a drop in orders for cars, which fell 9.6 percent in December.
But orders for computers increased 25.3 percent in December, after a 10.6 percent decline in November.
For household appliances, orders rose 10.6 percent in December, after a 6.6 percent decline. And, orders for nondurable goods, like food and clothes, rose 1.1 percent, in contrast to a dip of 0.4 percent in November.
In another report released yesterday, the placement firm of Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. said that job cuts announced by corporations in January increased 42 percent from December, led by the retail, commodities and transportation sectors.
Announced job cuts for January totaled 132,222, Challenger said, compared with 92,917 in December.
The cuts were led by the retail sector, which had 44,087 announced layoffs, followed by commodities, with 10,241, and transportation, with 9,958. Telecommunications companies, which shed jobs for much of last year, showed some improvement, with cuts falling to 7,265 -- the second lowest level in 25 months.
The report said that in the last six months companies announced plans to cut 746,781 workers -- a figure larger than the annual totals for 12 of the last 14 years.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NUCLEAR STANDOFF; 
U.S. Official Says North Korea Could Sell Bomb Material

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
A senior Bush administration official warned today that North Korea, if allowed to reprocess spent nuclear fuel rods, could sell some of that fissile material to terrorists and other enemies of the United States who are seeking to build nuclear weapons.
 The official, Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage, told senators on Capitol Hill that North Korea's recent moves toward restarting a plutonium reprocessing facilitycould enable the country to build four to six new nuclear weapons within months. 
 But Mr. Armitage also predicted that North Korea, which is struggling to feed its people, would have sufficient bomb-grade plutonium to sell or trade to "a nonstate actor or a rogue state." 
"I believe that the arms race in North Korea pales next to the possibility of proliferation, which is our major fear, from North Korea -- that she would pass on fissile material and other nuclear technology to either transnational actors or to rogue states," Mr. Armitage said.
Mr. Armitage also confirmed to the senators that Pakistan had helped North Korea develop its nuclear weapons program, saying technology transfers between the two countries had gone "both ways."
He declined to provide details, however, saying Pakistan had assured the administration that such transfers had ended.
Administration officials have in the past been willing to acknowledge only in private that North Korea provided missile technology to Pakistan in exchange for assistance in enriching uranium for weapons.
Mr. Armitage's warnings about the threat of North Korean proliferation came just five days after American officials reported that spy satellites over North Korea had detected what appeared to be trucks moving some of the country's stockpile of 8,000 spent fuel rods out of storage at the Yongbyon nuclear complex. 
Intelligence officials have concluded that North Korea, which is thought to have one or two nuclear weapons now, could begin producing bomb-grade plutonium from the rods by late March. 
The possibility that North Korea could soon begin selling the raw materials for nuclear weapons, while Iraq's ability to produce those materials remains in doubt, prompted questions from both Republican and Democratic senators about why the Bush administration felt the urgent need to use military force to disarm Iraq. 
Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, asked whether North Korea's potential capacity to sell raw materials for nuclear bombs to terrorists made it "far more dangerous" than Iraq. 
Mr. Armitage replied that "it's quite a different situation in Iraq," saying that Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president, wanted to "intimidate, dominate and attack" his neighbors. 
"We're not quite sure that's the motivation of Kim Jong Il," the North Korean leader, Mr. Armitage said. "I think he wants to use it for economic benefits -- sell, barter, whatever."
The Bush administration has said that it is committed to a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis and has no plans to attack North Korea. 
But on Monday, the secretary of defense, Donald H. Rumsfeld, put 24 long-range bombers on alert for possible deployment to the Pacific. The move appeared to be intended to deter aggressive moves by North Korea in the event American goes to war in Iraq, as well as to give President Bush military options if diplomacy fails. 
The commander of United States forces in South Korea also announced today that 2,900 American soldiers might be held past the end of their tours here to ensure that all units remained "at 100 percent" strength. 
But the commander, Gen. Leon LaPorte, denied that the move was a device for adding to the 37,000 troops already in Korea. He promised to consult with South Korean military officials if more troops were needed "to ensure deterrence and preserve the peace of the Korean peninsula."
North Korea condemned the Pentagon's moves today, accusing the United States of plotting "to dominate the Korean peninsula." But the harsh oratory was not accompanied by any sign of movement or buildup of North Korean units above the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
Still, North Korea's party newspaper heightened concerns by advising the country's 1.8 million reservists to rally around the North Korean leader. North Korea has approximately 1.1 million full-time troops.
While the Pentagon's moves seemed to leave open the option of military action against North Korea, Mr. Armitage repeatedly emphasized today that the administration was prepared to hold direct, one-on-one talks with North Korea, provided its neighbors -- Russia, China, South Korea and Japan -- assisted in resolving the crisis. 
"We're going to have to have direct talks with the North Koreans, there's no question about it," Mr. Armitage said.

HEADLINE: Governor's Cutbacks Anger Advocates for the Arts and Health Care 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Gov. James E. McGreevey offered some sympathy today as he doled out the bad news, saying his budget would hurt programs he supported and bring pain to constituents he would like to help. But cuts in spending on the arts and health care left advocates for those programs feeling singled out and abandoned.
 "We're just going to see more people without health insurance coming to us for help," said Julane Miller-Armbrister, chief executive of the Plainfield Health Clinic outside Elizabeth. The governor's budget would exclude some low-income earners from state-subsidized health care. 
 "This is going to threaten every arts group in the state," said Jeffrey Woodward, managing director of the McCarter Theater Center and chairman of Art Pride New Jersey, an advocacy group.
"Nine-eleven meant no growth in our funding, so we had to lay people off," said Victor Davson, director of the Aljira Center for Contemporary Art in Newark. "So this comes as a second blow, and I don't know how many hits we can take."
There was no scarcity today of advocates to complain that the cuts affecting their projects were pointless or unfair. 
One of the reductions would save $76 million by lowering the household income eligibility for medical care subsidies under the Family Care Plan. The current income cutoff is $36,200 for a family of four; the governor wants to reduce that to $24,073. 
Ms. Miller-Armbrister said she could not guess how many people the cuts in eligibility would affect. But she said she expected to see many of them before long. 
"In allocating scarce resources, if you take from one pot, something has to come from somewhere else," Ms. Miller-Armbrister said. "So the people who will no longer be eligible to pay for care under the Family Care Program will end up in hospital emergency rooms, or else they'll come to us."
While health care for low-income families was cut, the Arts Council of New Jersey saw the $18 million annual appropriation it distributes to more than 200 groups disappear entirely, "suspended" as the governor put it. 
"Zeroes out" was the phrase offered by Lawrence P. Goldman, president and chief executive of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, which has been getting $1.4 million a year from the state toward an annual budget of $24 million. 
Mr. Goldman said the state money was crucial in raising money for the center. He then made the argument heard again and again from shaken arts directors around the state today: that the $18 million in annual state arts funding generates many times that amount in revenue -- $1 billion, according to recent Rutgers University study cited by several people. 
Arts programs draw people to the state who spend money, advocates say, on restaurants, travel , arts-related development and even baby sitters. 
Mr. Goldman said he had made that argument to Mr. McGreevey on Monday, when he and other representatives of the New Jersey arts community got the news from Mr. McGreevey himself.
The governor said that other state expenditures that also have economic consequences are being cut as well, Mr. Goldman said. Arts spending is less than one-tenth of one percent of the state budget, Mr. Goldman countered.
In all, Mr. McGreevey, a Democrat, told the Legislature, the proposed budget eliminates more than 109 programs for a savings of $300 million in a budget of $23.7 billion.
An additional cut was the $10 million allocation for the New Jersey Cultural Trust, a program to help arts organizations build endowments that was started by former Gov. Christie Whitman.
Also affected was the African Grove Institute for the Arts in Newark, which supports arts of the African diaspora. The institute recently received a $15,000 grant toward a budget of about $175,000, a grant that may not soon be repeated. Victor Walker, the director, said state arts funding was also under the knife in Missouri and California, two states where he hoped to establish programs.
The only answer, he said, was for arts groups to learn to be self-supporting.
"You can no longer rely on public funds," Mr. Walker said. "We are preaching that all over the country."
But Mr. Goldman said the battle of the budget had just begun.
"We are a creative bunch in the arts, and you can be sure well mount a creative campaign to restore those funds," Mr. Goldman said. "We didn't build the sixth largest arts center in the country in Newark by being shy."

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Adds $3.5 Billion To Reserves 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Facing an upsurge in potential liability claims, the American International Group increased its reserves by $3.5 billion yesterday in a move that could have reverberations across the insurance industry and in Washington, where Republican lawmakers are eager to restrain liability lawsuits. 
 The increase in A.I.G.'s reserves far exceeds increases by other insurers in recent years. Because A.I.G. has a reputation for careful management under its longtime chief executive Maurice R. Greenberg, its increase is regarded as a bellwether for what may be a wave of reserve increases across the insurance industry. 
 "If Hank Greenberg is getting hit with unexpected liability claims, the competition is also being hit with them," said Andrew Barile, an insurance consultant in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. 
Ira Zuckerman, an analyst for Nutmeg Securities in Fairfield, Conn., said: "Industrywide, you're probably going to see tens of billions of dollars in increases in reserves." Mr. Zuckerman also predicted that some companies would not be able to raise the capital they need and would collapse. "Some guys are not going to make it," he said.
A.I.G., with nearly $60 billion in capital, is in no danger of foundering in a sea of rising claims for injuries and financial losses on the policies it sells to corporate customers. With prices for coverage continuing to rise steeply, the company is expected to show a substantial profit when it reports 2002 earnings next week.
Nonetheless, investors signaled their distaste by pushing A.I.G.'s share price down to $51.70, a drop of 6.6 percent. The stock has been languishing after a high of about $100 two years ago, as investors have become concerned about returns in A.I.G.'s big domestic life insurance business. Earnings in that segment have been depressed, as they have throughout the life insurance industry, by poor investment returns in a broad market slump. Share prices of other insurers, both in the United States and Europe, dropped yesterday as well. 
Mr. Greenberg said that most of the unexpected costs requiring the increase in reserves came from corporate claims resulting from lawsuits over injuries, accusations of mismanagement by executives as in the Enron debacle, improper financial transactions, faulty products and medical malpractice. All those coverages, he said, "are suffering grievously from the tort system we have in this country today," and costing insurers more.
But analysts said a major part of the problem for A.I.G. and the rest of the industry was not liability lawsuits, but a decade of price cutting that was affecting their bottom lines. The trend may be even worse for the rest of the industry because A.I.G. very publicly refused to sell some coverage at prices it thought were unprofitable and was believed to have done a better job of estimating costs than rivals have.
Nevertheless, Mr. Greenberg took the opportunity in a conference call yesterday with analysts and investors to say that the insurance industry was joining forces with President Bush in his campaign against what Mr. Bush says is a plague of abusive liability lawsuits.
Disturbed by lawsuits that he contends mainly enrich lawyers, Mr. Greenberg said he met with half a dozen senators and administration officials last week about limiting the basis for suits and capping awards to plaintiffs. He said he planned to return to Washington today. 
"Both sides of the aisle are more convinced than I've seen in previous years that something must be done," he said.
Mr. Greenberg, who has been running A.I.G. more than 35 years, is not against leveraging the political influence he has amassed in Washington. Shortly after the World Trade Center attacks, he began campaigning to have the federal government, rather than insurers, pay most of the losses in a major terrorist attack. And last November, Congress passed a bill that would do just that.
A.I.G.'s reserve increase yesterday was for expected claims for coverage from 1997 to 2001, based partly on the trend in claims already received and trends in lawsuits. Mr. Greenberg said in the conference call that the frequency of claims received seemed to be leveling off in 2002. But that did not diminish his zeal for making changes to a legal system that he regards as one with chronic problems.
The big upswing in commercial insurance prices has been clear since the terror attacks, when the industry lost $50 billion. Last year, the price of some of A.I.G.'s liability policies jumped an average of nearly 90 percent, according to Mr. Greenberg. "And that is on top of significant rate increases in 2001," he said.
Over the last year, several of A.I.G.'s rivals have made big additions to their reserves for asbestos claims, most recently Travelers and Ace, the big Bermuda company. Some have set aside extra amounts for other kinds of claims, most notably the St. Paul Companies, which added more than $900 million for expected medical malpractice claims. But none have matched the scale and range of coverages involved in A.I.G.'s increase.
Mr. Greenberg said A.I.G. was not heavily burdened by asbestos claims because much of that coverage was sold in the 1960's and 1970's, when A.I.G. was just beginning to move toward the first rank of insurers.
As companies bolster their reserves they take money from their accumulated profits or capital and deduct the potential expenses from their current earnings. In A.I.G.'s case, the after-tax charge to earnings in the final quarter of last year will be $1.8 billion. 
With reduced capital, the companies come under closer scrutiny by rating agencies and regulators. When the capital falls below certain minimums rating agencies cut ratings, making it harder to sell coverage. Ultimately, regulators can seize control of companies in hopes of halting operations before an insurer runs out of money to make good on claims.
A.I.G. said that even with the increase in reserves, its capital grew in the last quarter of 2002.
Even so, as a result of the reserve increase -- with $700 million of it to come from coverage bought from other carriers and known as reinsurance -- Fitch Ratings said it was reviewing some of the company's financial ratings. But Standard & Poor's immediately reaffirmed A.I.G.'s AAA rating, the highest possible. While Moody's Investors Service affirmed its highest rating on A.I.G.'s long-term debt, it shifted its outlook to negative from stable and said it was reviewing some of its other ratings on the company. 
Last week, Mr. Greenberg, who is 77, caused a stir on Wall Street when, responding to a question about the company's succession plan, he replied that his successor was someone inside the company and added, "The board knows who it is, and the individual knows who it is." The company insisted then that he had said nothing new and turned aside suggestions today that Mr. Greenberg had been trying to reassure investors in advance of the disclosures on reserves.

HEADLINE: Law Firms Merge Or Close, Caught In Economy's Vise 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Law firms, commonly seen as islands of security and stability to their employees, are proving vulnerable to the turbulence in the economy.
 Squeezed between their clients and their own lawyers' wage demands in tough times, some firms are collapsing under the pressure. Big corporate clients are battling to keep costs down, while the firms' costs for lawyers, staff and technology are rising. At the same time, partners are often unwilling to accept declining pay, and they defect. 
 "There are more firms working on radically restructuring," said Lisa Smith, who leads the merger and consolidation practice at the consulting firm Hildebrandt International. She said her business was busier than ever advising law firms trying to avoid collapse, adding that there had recently been a number of desperate "last-ditch efforts" at mergers intended to stave off law firm implosions. "We're seeing a rash of them right now," she said.
The most spectacular collapse came last week, when partners at Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison, a prominent San Francisco Bay Area firm, decided to wind down the firm's business. On Monday, Skjerven Morrill, a 67-lawyer firm in San Jose, Calif., specializing in intellectual property law, announced that it would dissolve.
In December, Hill & Barlow, a 107-year-old Boston law firm, said it would dissolve after a group of real estate partners indicated that they planned to defect. 
This is not the first time that lucrative work for big companies and investment banks has dried up. But gradual changes in the practice of law have made law firms more vulnerable today than they have been in years, according to lawyers and their consultants. Many firms have become highly specialized and do not have, for example, the bankruptcy business to carry them until the economy picks up again.
Law firms' problems generally become evident early in the year as partners learn how much money they made the previous year and how much they will probably make in the coming year. If both figures are declining, some partners invariably begin to look for greener pastures; several partners jumped ship from Brobeck over the last year after the firm's decline became apparent during 2002.
"They'll jump for money," said Ward Bower, a principal at Altman Weil, a consulting firm that advises law firms. "Twenty years ago, they wouldn't. That injects volatility into the marketplace."
At Hill & Barlow, a group of real estate lawyers announced their intention late last year to join another firm, said Robert A. Bertsche, a former partner. "There have been times when one department has been stronger and another department has been weaker," he said, but partners would remain loyal. "They were different times. And maybe they were different people."
When partners defect, Mr. Bower said, the firm still faces leasing and personnel costs, but with fewer lawyers to bring in revenue, squeezing profits. The weak economy has the same effect, driving down compensation and leading more partners to abandon ship, Mr. Bower said. 
Firms that relied heavily on slipping sectors of the economy -- technology companies, in Brobeck's case -- have found the climate particularly harsh. Brobeck shed nearly a third of its lawyers last year, before deciding last week to cease operating as a single firm.
Conventional wisdom held that law firms could weather economic downturns by relying on business lines like bankruptcy and civil litigation that tend to increase in bad times. But in the late 1990's, not all firms kept their staffs or their clientele balanced, leaving them without bankruptcy lawyers to subsidize the stock-offering gurus whose work is now less in demand.
"The countercyclical practices for the most part are not evenly distributed," Mr. Bower said. Firms with big bankruptcy practices, like Weil, Gotshal & Manges of New York -- which is representing Enron, among others -- are very busy. But other firms with little bankruptcy expertise are experiencing a tough year, he said.
Law firms generally carry more debt today as well. Brobeck, for example, is reported to have had tens of millions of dollars in debt, and that obligation was a significant factor in the decision to wind down, partners said last week.
In statements, Brobeck's lawyers also attributed the firm's demise to the failure of merger negotiations with a larger firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, which has big offices in New York, Philadelphia and Washington. 
Such merger efforts are more often evidence of a firm introuble than the cause of its difficulties, Ms. Smith, the consultant, said.
A more likely culprit is the steady increase in law firms' costs. The prices of long-term leases have increased, and some firms, like Brobeck, planned on space for many more lawyers than they have. Brobeck shrank to about 500 lawyers last week from 900 lawyers in 2000. In addition, the cost of computers and other technology used by firms has doubled every three years since 1983, Mr. Bower said. And salaries for associates and for support staff soared in the late 1990's.
The legal industry also continues to consolidate, creating more and more huge firms with 1,000 or more lawyers. Such firms have offices in more locations, making it easier to serve multinational clients, said Steven M. Polan, whose 45-person New York firm of Kalkines, Arky, Zall & Bernstein recently combined with Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, a 285-lawyer firm based in Los Angeles. 
"We were thinking bigger and thinking about being able to practice on a national platform," Mr. Polan said. "A 45-person law firm was not a size that seemed to be a growing presence in the marketplace."
Larger firms generally mean higher billable rates to their clients because law firm combinations do not yield economies of scale, Mr. Bower said. Overhead costs do not decline after such mergers, he said. 
Nevertheless, merger activity among law firms has continued. Although the number of mergers declined in 2002 from 2001, the size of the merging firms increased. Hildebrandt reported 53 law firm mergers in 2002, down from 82 the previous year but up sharply from the mid-1990's; there were just 11 such mergers in 1997.
"By contrast to the corporate world, law firm mergers have been pretty consistently high and at a much higher level than they have been in the past," Ms. Smith, the consultant, said. "It's starting to have a real impact on the shape of the legal market in some cities."

HEADLINE: A Ticking Clock on North Korea 

 BODY:
North Korea's rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program is the most urgent threat facing America today. Yet the administration, intent on dealing with Iraq first, has been reluctant to give diplomacy with North Korea the priority it warrants. Yesterday's reaffirmation by Washington that it recognizes the need for direct talks with North Korea is fine, but not good enough. Those talks will probably never take place unless the administration drops its preconditions. 
 The North has said it will talk about ending its nuclear ambitions as part of a broader discussion encompassing guarantees of its security and desperately needed economic help. Washington is willing to discuss those issues later, but for now only wants to hear how North Korea intends to end its nuclear projects. Pyongyang also prefers to deal with Washington alone, while the Bush administration wants other countries involved. By the time the two sides agree on the ground rules, North Korea could already have multiplied by three or fourfold the two nuclear weapons it is now suspected of having. If the administration wants to deal from its own maximum strength, it should talk now. 
 While the White House frets about the appearance of rewarding North Korean misconduct with unconditional talks and worries about temporarily shifting the spotlight off Saddam Hussein, North Korea seems to be getting ready to build bombs on a very fast timetable. It could have an additional five or six by July. Punishing past duplicity and focusing on one crisis at a time are sound diplomatic precepts. But this crisis is far too pressing for such niceties to stand in the way of the best remaining chance for a peaceful solution. 
Negotiating with Pyongyang is a predictably frustrating experience. But passing up the chance for diplomacy would risk two far more unpleasant options. Washington would either have to accept a North Korea with plenty of nuclear bombs to brandish and leftover plutonium to sell to the highest bidder, or face the possibility of a new Korean War.
In the absence of active diplomacy, the Pentagon's decision to put 24 long-range bombers on alert for possible transfer to bases closer to Asia may do more harm than good. The intended message is twofold. Washington wants to signal North Korea that even as the United States mobilizes forces for imminent war with Iraq, it is still able to act in Northeast Asia. 
The other message is more menacing. While the administration has assured North Korea it has no intention of invading, it has left open the possibility of a pre-emptive air attack on North Korean nuclear plants. Alerting the long-range bombers sharpens that warning. Unfortunately, it does so in a way that could heighten tensions in an already alarmed region. 
Unconditional negotiations with Pyongyang do not oblige Washington to hand out any rewards to North Korea before that country agrees to a verifiable plan for permanently ending its nuclear weapons ambitions. Negotiating the precise linkage and sequence of these elements is exactly what the two countries need to talk about. They should start doing so now.

HEADLINE: Moscow Journal; 
Capitalism Spawns a New Leisure Class: Mall Rats

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
They come on free shuttle buses and flock together in the food court. They play video games for hours in the Soyuz computer store. They are Moscow mall rats.
 The "rats" -- and their habitat -- are still rarities in Moscow. The first mall -- a gaudy tomb of luxury stores that appeared in 1997 underneath a central public square -- was more a museum than a place to shop. Later, a Turkish retailer began opening malls in Moscow's thickly settled suburbs. 
 Now, the Russian capital has 21 malls, one for every 500,000 people, fewer even than in Warsaw, a city one-fifth the size, according to the Moscow office of Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate consultancy. 
But the word is spreading that the mall is the place to be. Benches, tree-lined alleyways and food courts are becoming cold-weather alternatives to traditional hangouts -- city parks and the Old Arbat street. In the gray slush of Saturday, teenagers jammed into shuttle buses that run to a new mall in southwestern Moscow. In other neighborhoods, they walked or hitched rides from their parents.
"It's a great place to come and have a rest from my parents," said Anvyar Ilyasov, 16, standing with a cluster of boys at a Sony PlayStation in an electronics store in the Mega mall in southwest Moscow. "My friends told me about it."
In Soviet times, of course, those parents shopped in drab department stores where almost all items were behind glass and lines predominated. Understandably, they were skeptical of malls at first, thinking they were only for rich people. Indeed, after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the older generation switched to outdoor markets, where even in winter clothes flutter on canvas sales stalls and cabbages are hawked out of the backs of trucks. 
"People have this impression about malls, they are afraid to walk in," said Stanislav V. Tishenko, a manager at a new Moscow mall. 
But the economy is growing, wages -- particularly in Moscow -- are rising, and the outdoor markets are closing -- 167 now, down one-third since 1999. Last month, the city authorities closed two of the most popular outdoor markets.
"If that happened five years ago, there would have been a mutiny," said Mariya Volkenshtein, a sociologist at Validata Market Research in Moscow. Malls, she said, are "becoming normal for everyone."
The teenagers remember little or nothing of Soviet shopping agony. Their faces go blank when asked about lines. Instead of the no-frills consumption of their parents' day, young Russians today are surrounded by capitalism at its most raw. 
They feast on American culture, but scorn American politics. Aleksei Shulenin, dressed in a knit hat pulled down over his ears, a Nike shirt and baggy jeans, looked as if he had been plucked from thehalls of an American high school. He spoke admiringly of American music and movies. 
"Americans think they can do anything," he said between bites of a burrito bought at the nearby Mexican fast food restaurant. "Americans believe whatever their government tells them."
But there are other forms of quiet flattery. The word shopping has made its way into the Moscow vernacular. One of the larger malls that opened last year calls itself WayMart, just one letter off from the giant American retailer. The mall's management says the likeness is pure coincidence.
What Moscow malls lack in number they make up for in size. Mega is Eastern Europe's biggest mall, though still smaller than most American malls. It contains an indoor skating rink, and has had 1.5 million visitors since it opened last month, said Olga Starichenko, the mall's spokeswoman. 
Mallgoers, according to Mega's marketing surveys, are ages 25 to 45. Most are at the upper end of Moscow's midwage earners, which means they take home monthly salaries of $300 to $400. Muscovites earn more than double the Russian average wage.
Some of the high-schoolers have taken after-school jobs, something unheard of for their parents. Christina Khlystalova, 16, said she earned extra spending money by handing out advertising leaflets outside subway stops, much to the chagrin of her mother, a hairdresser.
"It's easy to find work in Moscow now," said Yevgeniya Kostomarova, who works at a computer store to supplement her finances. "You have to show some initiative, but you can advance without personal connections to the boss."
Almost all the teenage mall-rovers claimed to be from middle-class families, but few could agree on a definition. A group of friends in a mall on Kashirskoye Shosse in southeastern Moscow said their middle-class parents owned foreign luxury cars, like BMW's. Out of a group of five, three had cellphones, every one had an e-mail address, and the girls had nose piercings. Mr. Ilyasov, on the other hand, said his parents could not afford to buy a car.
It is too early to tell if shopping habits will turn around completely. Russians have traditionally traveled to the center of Moscow to shop. Now, as more buy cars, the new malls are reversing the flow, luring people out to the city's edges, much like shopping patterns in the United States. 
At the mall on Kashirskoye Shosse, Ms. Khlystalova and her two girlfriends talked about their lives over hamburgers and French fries. There is really nothing special in a mall, they agreed. 
"It's a place we go when we're bored," Ms. Khlystalova said.

HEADLINE: The Iraqis' Use of Poison Gas 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "A War Crime or an Act of War?," by Stephen C. Pelletiere (Op-Ed, Jan. 31): 
 In 1988, as a staff member working for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I documented Iraqi chemical weapons attacks on 49 Kurdish villages in Dihok Province along Iraq's border with Turkey. 
These attacks began on Aug. 25, 1988, five days after the Iran-Iraq war ended, and were specifically targeted on civilians. 
As a result of the committee's report, the Senate unanimously approved comprehensive sanctions on Iraq.
Between March 1987 and August 1988, Iraq made extensive use of chemical weapons against Kurdish villages as part of a campaign aimed at depopulating rural Kurdistan. These attacks have been well documented by human rights groups, forensic investigators and the Kurds themselves. Many occurred in places far from the front line in the Iran-Iraq war. 
The Kurdish survivors of the Halabja attack all blame Iraq, and many report seeing Iraqi markings on the low-flying aircraft that delivered the lethal gas. While the most deadly, the Halabja attack was one of between 60 and 180 such attacks that took thousands of civilian lives.

The lawsuit on behalf of six black car owners accuses the company of unfairly rerouting credit applications from black consumers to its regional headquarters rather than processing them in an automated, colorblind computer program. Those customers were denied loans, the suit said. It also said that black customers who were in good standing had their vehicles repossessed without warning.

HEADLINE: On a Mission To Shine A Spotlight On Genocide; 
Samantha Power's Mind Leaps From Bosnia to Iraq

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
By her own definition Samantha Power is a child of Bosnia. Not literally: born in Ireland in 1970, she came to the United States when she was 9. With her billowy red hair and long-legged stride, she exudes a purposeful all-American energy that is far from the bleakness of the Balkans.
 But Bosnia is where she came of age, she says, just as a generation before hers was marked by Vietnam, and another was defined by World War II. 
 "Our view of American power was born" in Bosnia, said Ms. Power, author of "A Problem From Hell," about American responses to genocide in the last century that has prompted new debates about the moral responsibilities that go with American power. 
She came to Bosnia in 1993, joining the swarms of freelance reporters drawn to the unfolding war.
The story there was shocking -- a widening arc of atrocities against victims targeted not for what they had done, but for who they were -- all taking place on a continent where genocide was never supposed to happen again. But more shocking for this 23-year-old, one year out of Yale University, was that the American government seemed unwilling to stop it. 
The final blow came in Srebrenica, a doomed town that had been designated a "safe haven" by the United Nations and its international peacekeepers, where in July 1995 an estimated 7,000 Muslim men and boys were massacred by Bosnian Serbs. 
Ms. Power then realized that newspaper articles -- however grisly, however accurate -- do not change policy. She left the region in anger and frustration. "It wasn't about me, Samantha," she said. "It was about impotence." Ms. Power's response was to embark on what was to become a 610-page book, with a title borrowed from the phrase once uttered by Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state. She began as a reporter, and ended up with a mission. 
There is an intensity in just about everything Ms. Power does, including the way she speaks. She weaves ideas together so fast that sometimes she has to jot down what she has just said, to remind herself how she made the leap from one subject to another.
She grew up with sports -- her mother was an Irish squash champion -- and her first ambition was to be a sports broadcaster. 
Returning to the United States in the mid-1990's Ms. Power was struck by this country's rediscovery of the horrors of the Holocaust, through books, films and newly opened museums. The words "never again" had become a political commonplace. But to her ears, they seemed a mockery of the policy failures she had witnessed in Bosnia.
When she went looking for books to explain this discrepancy, she could not find any, so she decided to write one herself. 
"It was a totally innocent book," she said. "This was not a graduate-school thesis. I just wanted to find out the answer to the question: What was the American response and why?"
Her friends in this period described her obsession as "all genocide, all the time." A die-hard Red Sox fan (is there any other kind?) who attended 45 games last season, she found herself at a party talking to her idol, the pitcher Pedro Martinez. Only later did she realize that she hadn't let him get a word in, as she bombarded him with accounts of Rwanda and Bosnia.
The book has been praised for its mix of scholarship and journalism. It starts with an account of a futile effort by Henry Morgenthau, then the United States ambassador to Turkey, to persuade Washington to stop the killing of Armenians by the Ottoman Turks in 1915 and moves on to the compelling and little-known story of Raphael Lemkin, a Jewish linguist from Poland whose family was killed in the Holocaust and who waged an obsessive battle to put genocide -- a word he coined -- on the international agenda.
But the crux of "A Problem From Hell" is an account of how American foreign policy -- despite the Holocaust -- stayed largely silent in the face of the atrocities in Cambodia, Iraq, Bosnia and most recently and dramatically in Rwanda. The United States pushed for the withdrawal of United Nations troops from Rwanda as the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis got under way.
In the case of Bosnia, the United States did take action -- albeit belatedly, and through NATO -- and later in Kosovo led NATO in a bombing campaign to force the Serbs to stop their atrocities against the rebellious ethnic Albanians there.
Ms. Power, now 32, wrote the book in five years, traveling to the Balkans and other site of genocide and managing to graduate from Harvard Law School in 1999. In 2001 her first publisher, Random House, dropped the book when, by her account, she refused to make it "more personal, more polemical." New Republic/Basic Books published the work last spring.
By the time "A Problem From Hell" came out, its analysis of Washington's paralysis in the face of genocide seemed like an echo from the past. The terrorist attacks of September 2001 had reshaped the world and made national security the overriding foreign policy priority.
"Someone said the other day that genocide is so 1990's," Ms. Power said in a borrowed office in New York, where the United Nations Security Council was wrangling over the United States' apparent intention to wage war against Iraq. "There is a way in which nonintervention now seems to be a moot point."
While the Bush administration is ready to intervene in Iraq in the name of national security, there is no indication that humanitarian intervention, as cited in Kosovo by the Clinton administration, is still a feature of American policy.
And yet Ms. Power's book, which has been nominated for several prizes, has stirred debate in foreign policy circles as diplomats and experts deal with the question of when and how American power, military and diplomatic, should be deployed on behalf of humanitarian goals. 
Richard Holbrooke, the former United Nations ambassador and architect of the Dayton accords that ended the Bosnian war, has declared it a "breakthrough book"; he has distributed copies around the foreign policy circuit, including one to the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
"It is not about moralism as foreign policy, it is about moral values in foreign policy," Mr. Holbrooke said. He likened Ms. Power to Maude Gonne, the fiery Irish nationalist who was W. B. Yeats's longtime love and muse. (Ms. Power was recently featured in an magazine advertisement for the luxury car Infiniti promoting a book about projects and people trying to change the world. Ms. Power said she hesitated before appearing in the ad, but went ahead on the theory that it would put her theories "into the mainstream.")
Ms. Power bridles at critics who interpret the book as a simplistic call for military intervention in cases of humanitarian crises. Her point, she said, is not that the United States failed to intervene in Cambodia, Iraq or Rwanda, but that it failed to do anything at all.
"If you think of foreign policy as a toolbox, there are a whole range of options -- you can convene allies, impose economic sanctions, expel ambassadors, jam hate radio," she said. "There is always something you can do, but if you look at most of these cases, you see that the toolbox stays closed even when the violations are bad, really bad, even when they are in the red zone."
In the case of Rwanda, for instance, genocide never came up at any cabinet meeting, and the word was banned at the State Department. "Be careful," said one document found by Ms. Power. "Legal at State was worried about this yesterday -- Genocide finding could commit (the U.S. Government) to actually 'do something.' "
Ms. Power now teaches at the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard University. A colleague there, Michael Ignatieff, said her book "has had a big echo." He said, "it raises such disturbing questions about how bureaucracies advertently and inadvertently conspire to deny evil, and to construe themselves to be helpless against evil." 
Everyone, Ms. Power included, agrees that humanitarian intervention is never simple. By its very definition, it implies a violation of another country's sovereignty, which can have a destabilizing effect and lead to unintended consequences; for instance, intervention did not stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, where the Albanians have pushed out most Serbs, Roma and Gorani, a Muslim minority.
Politics and history must be taken into account: after the Vietnam War, Americans had no stomach for any involvement in Cambodia, no matter how horrible the crimes of the Pol Pot regime. Many attribute Washington's passivity to the genocide in Rwanda in April 1994 to the public's horrified response to the botched humanitarian mission in Somalia the year before.
Anthony Lake, who was President Clinton's national security adviser, now admits that the United States failed in Rwanda. "It was a failure of the international community, and we are the leaders of that community," he said, adding that he hopes Ms. Power's book will stimulate debate about how best to intervene in humanitarian crises, including the largely unnoticed civil war in Southern Sudan, which by his estimate has cost two million lives.
In The London Review of Books, Ms. Power's book was cited as an example of how humanitarian intervention as embraced by American liberals helped lay the groundwork for the Bush administration's policy of pre-emptive intervention, as now foreseen for Iraq. "Having supported unilateralist intervention outside the U.N. framework during the 1990's, liberals and progressives are simply unable to make a credible case against Bush today," wrote Stephen Holmes, a professor at New York University.
But Ms. Power questions the legitimacy of the Bush administration's approach. "Because it adheres to international law in such a selective way, it lacks the legitimacy to stand as the military guardian of human rights," she said. "A unilateral attack would make Iraq a more humane place, but the world a more dangerous place." 
Ms. Power argues that Iraq exemplifies America's failure to recognize that responding to genocide is in the national interest. In 1989, she noted, the United States doubled its aid budget to Iraq, months after Saddam Hussein had used chemical weapons against his Kurdish citizens, as well as against Iranian soldiers.
Such policies lead to the credibility gap that she said the United States is facing today as it tries to convince world public opinion of its motives for a pending invasion of Iraq.
"You can't allow these kinds of crimes to go unnoticed, and not have them come back and reflect on us," she said.

 HIGHLIGHTS

ANOTHER HAT -- Kevin Spacey, left, appeared poised yesterday to take a leading position with the financially troubled Old Vic Theater in London. British press reports said Mr. Spacey, 43, the Academy Award-winning American actor who has maintained a close association with the theater since he appeared there in 1998 in "The Iceman Cometh" by Eugene O'Neill, could be named to a top administrative post today at a fund-raising event. The appointment was said to have the support of the theater's chairman, Sir Elton John. The 180-year-old, 1,000-seat theater is in need of millions of dollars in renovations to ensure its survival. Mr. Spacey has raised money for the theater and regularly attends its board meetings.

CURTAINS -- At the entrance of the United Nations Security Council chamber, a baby blue curtain has been placed over a ruglike copy of "Guernica," Pablo Picasso's powerful antiwar painting. Picasso's depiction of the horrors of war, given by the estate of Nelson A. Rockefeller, who donated the money for the United Nations compound, hung at a site where it often provided a background to televised interviews with ambassadors and other officials. On Jan. 27, when Hans Blix, the chief United Nations chemical and biological weapons inspector, was to appear, microphones were repositioned to accommodate expanded press coverage, diplomats discussing peace were placed in front of Picasso's image. Speaking of the blue curtain and member flags that now decorate the area, Fred Eckhard, press secretary of the United Nations, said, "It is an appropriate background for the cameras."

ALL THIS JAZZ -- The music may be old, but the band is young. The New York Youth Symphony's new ensemble, Jazz Band Classic, for musicians from 12 to 22 years old in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, will make its debut at 2 p.m. Sunday at Aaron Davis Hall, at 135th Street and Convent Avenue on the City College campus in Hamilton Heights. Modeled after the big bands of the 1930's and 40's and directed by the trombonist Ryan Keberle, the band will be joined by the renowned saxophonist Jimmy Heath, right.

PORTRAIT OF THE ARTISTS -- From behind the art come the faces that are the focus of the exhibition that opens on Friday at the Smithsonian Institution's International Gallery in Washington. These faces belong to artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Alexander Calder, Chuck Close, Salvador Dali, Helen Frankenthaler, Jackson Pollock and John Singer Sargent. The photographs were taken by people like Zaida Ben-Yusuf and Alice Boughton, who were early members of Alfred Stieglitz's circle, and by latter-day photographers like Robert Mapplethorpe and Arnold Newman. Organized by the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery last year in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of ARTnews magazine, this who's who of the art world consists of 100 photographs from its pages, as well as some previously unpublished images. "Portrait of the Art Word: A Century of ARTnews Photographs" continues through April 6.

FOLLOW-UP -- A French waiter accused of stealing more than 200 paintings and art objects worth more than a billion dollars from museums in four European countries testified yesterday in a Swiss court that his first theft, in 1995, was prompted by the beauty of a woman in an 18th-century German painting valued at $2,100, the BBC reported. "I was fascinated by her beauty, by the qualities of the woman on the painting and by her eyes," the waiter, Stephane Breitwieser, 32, said of the work by Christian Wilhelm Dietrich. Much of what Mr. Breitwieser allegedly stole was cut up and thrown into a French canal by his mother after his arrest.

WINNING COMPANY -- Winston Churchill will be there. So will Albert Einstein, Marie Curie (above right), Ernest Hemingway and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. All of them figure in "Cultures of Creativity: The Centennial Exhibition of the Nobel Prize." After an international tour that included Stockholm, Oslo, Tokyo and Seoul, this exhibition about the honors in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, economics and peace that have been awarded to 700 people since the first prize in 1901 will open on Friday for a run through May 11 at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. Artifacts like test tubes, a typewriter, eyeglasses and an ear of corn that figure in stories of the prizewinners are part of the exhibition, along with video productions and other displays that bring to life individual creativity and the cities, universities and laboratories where they lived and worked.

FOOTNOTES

GOODBYE AND HELLO -- "Oklahoma!" will close on Feb. 23, earlier than expected. The Broadway revival of the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, directed by Trevor Nunn and a critical and popular hit at the Royal National Theater in London in 1998, opened in New York last spring to mixed reviews and will have recouped only about 60 percent of its $6.5 million cost. A national tour is planned; production officials had no comment on reports that the tour would be a non-Equity undertaking. . . . The Almeida Theater will return to action at its refurbished home in the Islington section of London on Oct. 23 with the British premiere of Neil LaBute's play "The Mercy Seat." Directed by Michael Attenborough, the Almeida's artistic director, the play will run through Dec. 6. First seen last November in New York in an MCC production at the Acorn Theater, the play deals with a married man and his mistress on the morning after the terrorist destruction of the World Trade Center.

HEADLINE: U.S. Delays Suing Europe Over Ban on Modified Food 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
With war looming in Iraq, the Bush administration has decided against antagonizing its European allies and has postponed filing a case against the European Union for its ban on genetically modified food, according to a senior administration official.
 "There is no point in testing Europeans on food while they are being tested on Iraq," said a senior White House official who asked not to be identified. 
 Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, had said that the administration would decide soon whether to sue the Europeans for what he called their "immoral" opposition to genetically modified food. He said that stand was leading to starvation in the developing world. 
A cabinet meeting to consider the suit was canceled this week as European agricultural officials descended on Washington to argue for patience. 
Even so, the conflict will resurface soon. Mr. Zoellick has said he believes that genetically modified food could help alleviate hunger -- as well as open markets for American farmers -- and wants the European opposition to be confronted so that developing nations accept food from genetically modified crops. 
But the heated rhetoric of a few weeks ago, when Mr. Zoellick accused the Europeans of having a Luddite attitude against biotechnology, was muted this week as both sides stressed the importance of lifting the ban. 
The question is when. 
Ann M. Veneman, the United States agriculture secretary, has said that "our patience is just running out." 
Franz Fischler, the European Union's farm commissioner, said that he met with Ms. Veneman and told her the problem would be resolved within three or four months. 
"We do not have a fundamental opposition to genetically modified food," said Mr. Fischler at a press conference today. "We are in the final phases of passing our laws in Parliament and we would strongly advise not to start an action that would disrupt that."
Experts agree that the United States could win a case at the World Trade Organization and force a lifting of the four-year-old ban.
At the same time, they agree that the ultimate resolution of this case will rest on labeling -- not opposing notions of science -- and that it promises to pit European ideas of proper regulation against American notions about free and unfettered trade.
European consumers have for years questioned the safety of genetically modified food out of fear that those modifications may have unknown, and unintended, consequences for human health. 
They are demanding labels that identify which food has been genetically modified and has passed rigorous testing. The agricultural establishment in the United States is just as strongly opposed, saying that once the food has passed tests there is no need to distinguish it with label that could be seen as a warning.
"That implies that there is something wrong with genetically modified food," said Elsa Murano, the Agriculture Department's undersecretary for food safety. "It would be another kind of trade barrier."
Industry also complains of the cost. "Labeling is a sham," said Mary Kay Thatcher, lobbyist for American Farm Bureau, a powerful agricultural group. "It would be so expensive, it would shut down our exports."
Margaret Beckett, the British minister in charge of food and the environment, said both sides of the argument had to understand the serious cultural differences underlying the disagreement. 
After the deaths in Europe from mad cow disease and the subsequent killing of herds infected by foot and mouth disease, European consumers are wary of any food that is not clearly labeled and easily traced.
"Extravagant claims are sometimes made on either side of the argument," she said. "Whether we like it or not, there is an expectation of traceability and labeling of all kinds of products among European consumers. You are not going to convince them that GM products should be an exception to what is the norm."
While European nations agree on the need for labeling in the face of deep consumer fears, American lawmakers have had a more mixed record.
Although it took 12 years of lobbying by farmers, chefs and environmentalists, the agriculture department last year created an official organic label to show consumers what produce has been raised without conventional pesticides or fertilizers, antibiotics or growth hormones. The food is growing in popularity -- it is a $4 billion industry -- and public response was overwhelmingly in favor of the new label. 
As industry feared, the cost of the label has proved prohibitive for some of the smallest farmers -- averaging $5,000 each year -- and the paperwork is time-consuming. Federal officials believe that the process could be streamlined over the years.
In last year's farm bill, Congress included a provision opposed by much of agribusiness that required that all meat, fish and produce be labeled with its country of origin within two years. 
Already, Canada has complained that the new country of origin labeling will restrict its trade with the United States, especially in meat. In a study released last month, Canadian officials complained of the cost and suggested that the new provision should be withdrawn.
That is unlikely until the European ban on genetically modified food is lifted and the issue of labeling is confronted head on. 
Trade and agricultural experts predict that in the end a compromise may have to be reached among competing interests within the United States as well as between the Europeans and the Americans.
"The United States is not monolithic," said John Audley of Carnegie Endowment. "Business groups may have to yield on labeling while activists will have to yield on allowing genetically modified food to be sold and let consumers decide what they want."

HEADLINE: Council Speaker Says State And U.S. Owe City Billions 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN

 BODY:
Even as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg stuck to his nonconfrontational budget negotiating tactics, Council Speaker Gifford Miller took a decidedly tougher approach yesterday, accusing both Gov. George E. Pataki and President Bush of cheating New York City out of billions of dollars.
 "Mr. President and Governor Pataki, something's got to give," Mr. Miller said, "because so far, the citizens of New York City have been doing all the giving." 
 In an address to elected officials and labor and business leaders at City Hall, Mr. Miller said it was time for the governor and the president to pick up their portion of the bill for New York City's deficit. The speaker said the state and federal governments do not fairly share revenue and are as much to blame for the city's economic slide as the World Trade Center attack. 
"Our city's relations with the state and federal governments are fundamentally unfair," he said. "We are overtaxed and we are underserved. And we are fed up."
In the 40-minute speech, Mr. Miller urged that Washington release $3 billion to New York City for Sept. 11 disaster relief. 
"Why shouldn't New York get this assistance, when we have been bombed by Al Qaeda?" he said. "All New York City wants is what other local governments were granted in the past."
Mr. Miller also called on Albany to allow the city the authority to impose a $1 billion commuter tax.
"Twenty cities currently have some form of commuter tax, including Yonkers," he said. "The state imposes its own commuter tax. Why should we be treated differently? Let New York City decide its own fate."
While Mr. Miller was equally critical of Albany and Washington, he had pointed words for Mr. Pataki and the budget he proposed last week. One by one, Mr. Miller took apart the governor's plans.
"Take his proposal for a transit fare increase," Mr. Miller said. "The governor likes to pretend it isn't a tax. But what else do you call it, governor, when you take money from the pockets of working people?" 
Of the proposed tuition increase at State University of New York and City University campuses, he said: "Making it harder for people to get a college education doesn't just kill jobs. Governor, it kills hope and opportunity."
Mr. Miller, who is expected to run for mayor in the future, possibly against Mr. Bloomberg, announced the start of Fair Share, a new civic pride campaign. He said the idea was to get New Yorkers to press Washington and Albany for help, through rallies, phone calls and letters.
Betsy Gotbaum, the city's public advocate and also a possible mayoral candidate, said Mr. Gifford's message was one that Mayor Bloomberg should be making. "He said to Albany and to Washington, 'Don't tell New York City to drop dead.' "
The city comptroller, William J. Thompson Jr., who has also been included in a short list of possible mayoral candidates, agreed. "I think all of us would like to see the mayor fight for New York City, fight for its people," he said. "The mayor prefers a very different style."
At a news conference in Queens, Mr. Bloomberg insisted that there was no design behind his and Mr. Miller's divergent styles.
"There is no coordinated effort between the speaker and I to play good cop, bad cop," Mr. Bloomberg said. "There is a coordinated effort between the two of us to get the resources this city needs."

HEADLINE: Yazoo Boondoggle 

 BODY:
Every so often something comes along to remind us of Congress's immense capacity for self-indulgence at the expense of sound public policy. This time it's the Yazoo Pump, a senseless (and expensive) project buried in the Senate version of a huge appropriations bill now headed to a House-Senate conference. Our hope is that fiscal conservatives among the House conferees will kill it. Failing that, it will be up to Christie Whitman, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to do so. This project is yet another instance of the destructive relationship between the Army Corps of Engineers and its pork-loving paymasters in Congress that, over the years, has produced one environmental disaster after another. 
 The Yazoo Pump is billed as a flood control project by its two Senate champions, Trent Lott and Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who say it's essential to the farm economy in the Mississippi Delta. The corps would build the world's largest pump, costing $181 million, which would drain 200,000 acres of wetlands and hardwood forest so that a relatively small number of soybean farmers who already drink liberally from the public trough can plant more crops. 
 The project, which has languished on the drawing boards since 1941, has provoked opposition from not only the usual environmental and taxpayer groups but also the Office of Management and Budget, Mrs. Whitman's E.P.A. and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Nevertheless, more than 60 senators with eyes on their own pet projects agreed to include it in the appropriations bill.
The budgetary argument against it is a no-brainer. An E.P.A. study found that the agricultural benefits of the project would amount to a measly $25.6 million, one-sixth the cost. The environmental arguments are also persuasive. The pump would damage two wildlife refuges and parts of a national forest, squandering investments the public has already made in these useful projects. By destroying wetlands, which filter out nitrogen and phosphorus, the project would also increase pollution loads in the lower Mississippi, adding to the environmental degradation of the Gulf of Mexico.
The administration's new budget contains nothing for the project. But the White House must still persuade the House conferees to block it in committee. If that fails, the White House must back Mrs. Whitman. She detests the project, but it will be easier for her to say no to Congress if she has the president's support.

HEADLINE: Nothing Like Big Deficits To Hearten BondTraders 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Only two years ago, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, voiced his fears that the government was in danger of building up such big budget surpluses that the Treasury market could dry up. Washington might have no choice, he warned, but to put its extra money into buying up corporate stocks and bonds.
 Never mind. With the Bush administration now forecasting deficits into the foreseeable future, there is no need to invent a life-support system for the $3 trillion Treasury market. The budget released Monday projects a record deficit, in nominal terms, of about $304 billion in the current fiscal year, followed by a $307 billion gap for fiscal year 2004, which begins Oct. 1. 
 "It looks like we are going to be in business for a long time," said James R. Capra, president of Capra Asset Management in Rye, N.Y., who two years ago was thinking of revamping his company so he could survive the shrinking Treasury market. 
Of course, there is something reassuring in all this for the many traders of Treasury securities who no longer have to worry about finding another line of work. While deficits may make them worry about higher interest rates, a world without a Treasury market was a far more unpleasant prospect.
"The market is much more comfortable now than it was in the reverse," said James Keller, executive vice president for government bond trading at Pimco, a big asset management firm. "The increase in debt is something we are all comfortable with because it has been the norm."
For bond investors, however, the ultimate threat is that big government borrowing, by putting upward pressure on interest rates, reduces the value of Treasury securities they already own. At the same time, though, new investors could earn greater returns from higher rates.
Whether deficits actually do push rates higher will be one of the hotly debated political issues this year, with the Bush administration denying it and Democrats swearing to it. Most economists, while acknowledging the complexity of the issue, see the deficit as one of several factors that certainly can weigh on interest rates.
Today the Treasury is scheduled to outline changes in its borrowing strategies, including the revival of defunct maturities. Quarterly issuance of 2-year to 10-year Treasury notes, which are used to borrow new money and to roll over maturing debt, has already more than doubled, to $121 billion, since the spring of 2001.
Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates, is betting on the return of the Treasury's three-year note, which was last issued in 1998. He predicts that by the end of the year the Treasury will also be auctioning eight new five-year notes a year, double the current pace.
But do not expect the venerable 30-year bond to return anytime soon. When Peter R. Fisher, the under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, eliminated the 30-year bond in October 2001, he said he expected budget surpluses to return soon, which made borrowing for 30 years too costly. But reviving the 30-year bond now would be seen by many as an official acknowledgment that deficits are here to stay well into the future.
The Bush administration has been working hard for months to combat the idea that larger budget deficits will push interest rates higher. R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, dismisses the connection between deficits and interest rates whenever he gets a chance. Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, repeated the assertion again when the president's budget was released. And, in fact, interest rates have remained near their lowest levels in more than 40 years despite the return of deficits.
That may be in part because the government's borrowing needs are relatively modest as a share of the overall economy. This year's and next year's deficits are expected to reach only about 2.8 percent and 2.7 percent of the gross domestic product, the Bush administration projects, well below the most recent peak of 5.1 percent, in 1985. Moreover, the economy is so weak that few private companies are out competing with the government to borrow money. 
Many economists, however, argue that the return of deficits will push interest rates higher if the Bush administration fails to convince investors that they will shrink rapidly as the economy returns to stronger growth in the years ahead.
"You need a significant downward trend in deficits as the economy expands," said John Lipsky, chief economist at J. P. Morgan. "Without this there will be an impact on interest rates."
Despite the debate over interest rates, many individual and professional investors are likely to be happy. There is no threat now that the world will lose its risk-free safe harbor in times of geopolitical and military uncertainty, including the approach of a possible war with Iraq.
The Treasury market will also continue to be deep and liquid, with so many bonds floating around that trades can be executed at narrow spreads without a hitch. That will maintain its role as the benchmark for a whole host of other interest rates -- including mortgage rates and corporate borrowing -- and obviate the need for traders to look to the swaps market and blue chip corporate bonds to judge the proper pricing of non-Treasury bonds and notes. The Treasury market will also continue to be the vehicle for hedging risk taken in other fixed-income markets.
The deficits could also lead to some hiring in a part of the fixed- income market that has shrunk a lot in recent years.
"The personnel in the Treasury business is down because of the consolidation of the business and the shrinking of the Treasury market," said Thomas Connor, head of Treasuries, agencies and swaps at J. P. Morgan.
What made a diminished Treasury market possible two years ago was that even with the first tax cut, the surpluses could have continued long enough -- less than five more years -- to become larger than the amount of government bonds and notes maturing each year, meaning that the government had no need to borrow to operate.
This prospect led Treasury officials to eliminate some popular securities, reduce the issuance of others and even buy back $67.5 billion in old debt. In response to the rapidly growing surpluses of the time, Paul H. O'Neill, then Treasury secretary, said he was looking into ways to keep the market alive because government bonds were such a critical benchmark for global interest rates.
Since then the return to deficits has been swifter than expected -- even by the many bond traders who had little confidence in the government to restrain tax cutting, spending or both. After four years of annual surpluses, peaking at just over $236 billion in 2000, deficits returned, primarily because the economy's weakness and the end of the stock market bubble caused revenues to shrink even as Washington was going ahead with President Bush's first big tax cut, which is expected to drain about $1.35 trillion from the government's coffers over 10 years. Add to that increased military spending, a rise in domestic spending, particularly for domestic defense, and the president's decision to seek another big 10-year tax cut of about $670 billion, which is included in his new budget.
The current deficit projections could wind up moving higher. The president's budget does not include money for a war with Iraq, which could cost from $50 billion to $200 billion, according to the administration's own estimates. And the White House's growth and revenue forecasts could be too optimistic.
The return of higher deficits and a large supply of new Treasury securities "is good for the bond business," Mr. Capra said. But "that does not mean that it is good for the country."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Short-Lived Surplus"Not long ago, Washington expected to annual budget surpluses for the rest of decade, wiping out the governments debt. But a combination of a weak economy, higher spending and lower taxes has pushed the budget back into the red for the foreseeable future. The deficits, though, are projected to be considerably smaller as a share of the overall economy than in the 1980's and early 1990's. Graph tracks budget surplus/deficit from 1999 through 2008 (current projections and projections made in 2000) Graph tracks surplus/deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product (actual and projected) from 1983 through 2008.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE TAX AGENCY; 
Budget Gives I.R.S. More Money to Investigate Tax Cheats

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
President Bush's budget would increase by a third or more the number of audits of taxpayers suspected of hiding income received from their businesses, partnerships, investments and offshore accounts.
 The administration identified five areas to which more resources would be devoted to stem tax cheating: abusive corporate tax shelters, unreported income among higher-income taxpayers, failure by employers to turn over taxes withheld from paychecks or even to withhold them, misuse of trusts and offshore accounts to hide income, and "tax denial" schemes that are based on claims that the tax code does not apply to most Americans. 
 The proposal is a first step toward reversing a long decline in enforcement of the tax laws. It could bring in billions of dollars owed to the government and would also help the states, which rely on Internal Revenue Service enforcement much more than on their own audits. 
But the proposal for I.R.S. financing falls far short of what Charles O. Rossotti, the last I.R.S. commissioner, said in November that the service needed to enforce the tax laws adequately.
Under the Bush plan the I.R.S. would get an additional $133 million for these audits and other law enforcement work in these five areas. Over all the I.R.S. would receive $10.4 billion, a 5.25 percent increase, but still less per tax return, after adjusting for inflation than it got five years ago. Law enforcement, which includes audits, takes up almost 40 percent of the I.R.S. budget.
The additional money would "target the real problem areas in a fair and evenhanded manner, restoring confidence in the tax system for hard-working taxpayers," said Pamela Olson, assistant treasury secretary for tax policy. 
"At the same time the I.R.S. goes after those who cheat," Ms. Olson added, "the I.R.S. must provide better service to law-abiding taxpayers and respect every taxpayer's rights. It can and it must do both."
But according to the formula Mr. Rossotti recommended in his final report to the I.R.S. Oversight Board, the agency would need an overall increase of more than 7 percent, as opposed to the 5.25 percent proposed by President Bush, to start closing the law enforcement gap.
Over the last five years, demands on the I.R.S. have grown in several ways. Congress has made the tax code far more complex, while at the same time imposing complicated new procedures to protect the rights of taxpayers. A growing number of promoters now teach people to exploit those procedures to thwart audits and the collection of taxes, according to Mr. Bush's budget. Congress also ordered better service to cooperative taxpayers. Without extra money to handle these duties, the I.R.S. diverted money from audits, which in turn lowered the risks of cheaters being caught.
The Treasury Department did not detail how much of the extra money would be applied to each of the five areas of cheating. It said only that with $133 million more it could increase audits of individuals who make more than $100,000 from 125,000 last year to 166,000 next year, a one-third increase, at a cost of about $3,200 per audit. For some tax dodges the number of audits would increase by more than a third; for others, the figure would be less.
The department also proposed tougher rules to make both promoters of tax shelters and the companies that buy them keep more records and make more disclosures.
The use of artificial losses in foreign currency transactions to make capital gains vanish is one of the most popular tax dodges. So are corporate transactions that inflate interest deductions. Entrepreneurs who place their business in a trust, because promoters persuaded them that it will make profits immune from taxes, are another area covered by the budget proposal. 
The extra money would also increase audits of those who buy into the growing number of fraudulent schemes asserting that it is legal to stop paying taxes if one uses a "pure trust," renounces his Social Security number or declares himself a sovereign citizen or a citizen of the state in which he lives (but not the United States). Another fraud, known as the 861 position, asserts that wages paid by American-owned companies are exempt from tax. None of these claims have been upheld by any judge anywhere, but the Treasury Department has acknowledged that the frauds have flourished in recent years.
Promoters of these schemes often cite as evidence that taxes need not be paid the statements of those senators and representatives who in the last five years have described the I.R.S. in terms like "rogue agency" run by "jackbooted thugs" and other remarks that the promoters twist into assertions that the I.R.S. is not a legitimate agency of the government.
This year the vast majority of tax cheats the I.R.S. identifies will get away without paying. Mr. Rossotti's report showed that the I.R.S. has only enough money to pursue about a fifth of individual cheats.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: CONGRESS; 
House Raises Questions on Dividend Taxes and Deficit

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
House Republicans, President Bush's strongest base of loyalty in Congress, were skeptical today about his plans for eliminating most taxes on dividends and for running large deficits in the foreseeable future.
 Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he still did not entirely understand Mr. Bush's plan and noted several times that the tax-writing committee would discuss alternatives over the next two months. 
 "We want to hear the pros, we want to hear the cons, we want to hear the alternatives," Mr. Thomas said at the outset of a hearing at which the only witness was John W. Snow, President Bush's new Treasury secretary. 
Mr. Thomas did not criticize the president's $674 billion plan directly, but he did not offer any endorsements either.
"I understand it a little better but I don't understand it in its entirety," Mr. Thomas told reporters after the hearing, referring to the proposal on eliminating federal taxes on most stock dividends. "It's very complicated. You want to understand the interactions of changes that are not entirely predicated on the removal of double taxation of dividends."
House Republicans have a much stronger grip on power than their counterparts in the Senate, who have a tiny majority and who are much more willing to compromise with Democrats as a result. 
But at two hearings today, the Republicans' normal solidarity showed at least modest cracks that could mean bad news for the White House. 
Mr. Snow, who made his first appearance before Congress as Treasury secretary, came under heated, if predictable, attacks from Democrats who repeatedly confronted him with his own past statements about the dangers of government deficits.
The White House's budget proposal for 2004, which includes a huge array of tax cuts, projects a record deficit this year of $307 billion and an accumulated deficit of $1.1 trillion by the end of 2008.
Mr. Snow showed few signs of being rattled, saying that times had changed since he had campaigned for deficit reduction in the mid-1990's. "The circumstances of then were different from the circumstances now," Mr. Snow said.
But at a separate hearing of the House Budget Committee, two House Republicans told the White House budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., that they were nervous about elements of Mr. Bush's plans. 
"I must say, this is a tough pill to swallow," Representative Gil Gutknecht, Republican of Minnesota, told Mr. Daniels. "It's very difficult for us to justify borrowing an extra billion -- oh, I'm sorry, an extra trillion, or two trillion, whatever the number is, from our grandchildren -- in order to say yes to all these national priorities." 
Representative Edward Schrock, Republican of Virginia, told Mr. Daniels that he liked some, but by no means all, of the president's tax proposals. "We need to hold the line on spending," he added.
Republicans appear most uncertain about Mr. Bush's plan to eliminate most taxes on stock dividends, a move that would cost the Treasury about $300 billion over 10 years. Though many tax experts agree with the administration that dividend taxes amount to "double taxation" of corporate profits -- once at the corporate level and again at the shareholder level -- the costs and the complexity of the administration plan has rattled many otherwise loyal Republicans.
Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, told Mr. Snow today that she was worried the proposal would have the side effect of discouraging companies from using tax credits for research and development and might discourage people from putting money into retirement plans that can lower taxes.
Mr. Thomas echoed those views. "That is exactly my point about fully understanding the impact," he said after the Ways and Means Committee hearing.
Democrats, almost unanimously opposed to Mr. Bush's tax-cutting plan, essentially focused their attack on Mr. Snow's apparent reversal from his past campaigns on reducing the deficit.
Citing an interview that Mr. Snow gave The Richmond Times-Dispatch in 1995, in which he said reducing the deficit would lower interest rates and "bring major economic benefits," Democrats demanded that he explain himself now.
Mr. Snow, refusing to budge from the White House script, said today's deficits were much smaller as a percentage of the total economy than they had been in the past.
Democrats responded that the projected deficit this year was 2.7 percent of the gross domestic product, a higher percentage than it was when Mr. Snow was speaking in 1995.
"You just throw away your precautions of seven years ago," said Representative Sander Levin, Democrat of Michigan. "The question I want to ask is, are you really totally confident that your concerns about the deficit in 1995 are irrelevant?"
Mr. Snow did not answer the question directly, but the answer seemed to amount to a "yes."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Cisco Sees No Upturn Soon for Technology Spending

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
Cisco Systems Inc., the largest maker of Internet network equipment, reported today that its sales held steady last quarter amid a continued technology downturn. But, in remarks that suggest an upturn is not imminent, Cisco's chief executive said customers had grown even more cautious about spending. 
 The chief executive, John T. Chambers, said that corporate executives seem to be holding tighter to their purse strings and that geopolitical uncertainty has had a "dampening effect" on the economy. 
 Cisco is hearing "even more conservative attitudes from executives than we heard a quarter ago," Mr. Chambers said in a conference call with Wall Street analysts to report fiscal second-quarter earnings. Mr. Chambers said that he was optimistic about the long-term outlook for Cisco, but that he was "a little more cautious than last quarter" about the company's near-term prospects. 
As business leaders look for signs indicating when the economy will show some vigor, Cisco's anecdotal evidence suggests continued weakness not just in the technology sector but in numerous businesses where Cisco sells nearly $20 billion a year in networking equipment.
Cisco reported second-quarter earnings that were essentially in line with its projections and with the estimates of Wall Street analysts. Sales were $4.71 billion, down from $4.8 billion in both the first quarter and in the second quarter of last year. 
Earnings were 15 cents a share pro forma, a figure that excludes costs related to acquisitions. That compares with 9 cents a share in the period a year earlier.
Wall Street analysts were expecting earnings of 13 cents a share.
The company projected that its revenue for the third quarter, which ends April 26, should be flat to down 2 percent to 3 percent.
Industry analysts, as well as Cisco, said one cause for optimism was the company's gross margin, a closely watched measure that calculates sales minus the cost of producing goods. Cisco had second-quarter gross margins of 70.4 percent, a strong figure generally speaking, and among Cisco's better performances. In the previous quarter, the company's gross margin was 69.3 percent. 
Larry R. Carter, the chief financial officer, attributed the higher gross margins to cost savings, notably lower component costs and greater manufacturing efficiencies. He said that he expected gross margins to fall next quarter to 68 to 70 percent, in part because it is a slower season for the company. 
Barry Jaruzelski, who oversees the global technology practice for Booz Allen Hamilton, a consulting company, said Cisco appeared to be holding its own "in spite of this hellacious environment." He added, however, that Cisco faces several challenges before it can return to being a major growth business, let alone the juggernaut that it was during the Internet boom. 
"They're executing within a nasty environment and sustaining their financials," Mr. Jaruzelski said. He added, "this is an execution story, not a growth story; they are living within their means."
Several industry analysts said that Cisco needed to continue to break into new markets to supplement its core businesses of selling routers and switches, the basic equipment that corporations use to build computer networks. 
David Willis, an analyst with Meta Group, said those markets were mature and did not offer Cisco much chance for growth unless the company took market share from competitors.
Mr. Chambers, who has said that he is focusing Cisco on new businesses, elaborated during the call with analysts. He said the company was spending 40 percent of its research and development on emerging areas, including technology used for wireless communications, computer security and storage, and transmitting voice over data lines.
Mr. Chambers also addressed the issue of dividends, which the company does not pay. He said Cisco did not have a "religious position on dividends" and would continue to monitor the issue in light of President Bush's proposal to cut taxes on dividends. But Mr. Chambers noted that shareholders last November defeated by an overwhelming margin a proposal to disburse dividends.
Shares of Cisco declined 28 cents, to end regular trading at $13.20. They fell about 5 cents in after-hours trading.

HEADLINE: American Asks Unions for $1.8 Billion in Cuts 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 4 

 BODY:
American Airlines asked its unions and other workers today for $1.8 billion in annual cost cuts, in what it called a last resort to turn the airline around.
 The president of the airline, Gerard J. Arpey, said that the unions were aware of the magnitude of the financial problems and that, while the airline's liquidity was good, the talks "can't take forever." 
 American's parent company, the AMR Corporation, recently reported a net loss of $3.5 billion in 2002, the worst shortfall in aviation history. 
Mr. Arpey, at the company's headquarters in Fort Worth, declined to name any date that a bankruptcy filing would become inevitable if the talks had not achieved results by then. He also declined to comment on a bankruptcy process, and said meetings with the unions were expected to go on continuously. 
American said in a news release that the cuts would come from wages, benefits and work rules. 
American proposed $660 million a year in concessions from pilots, $340 million from flight attendants, $620 million from employees represented by the Transport Workers Union, and $80 million from ticket agents and representatives. 
Management and related staff would give up $100 million, on top of more than $200 million in annual management-related cuts the airline says it has secured to date. 
American said it had evaluated labor costs at some competitors to help determine how much it would ask from each group. 
United Airlines and US Airways Group have both asked for hefty concessions from workers. US Airways said Monday that it had secured $1.9 billion in overall annual savings. United's five labor unions have agreed to temporary pay cuts to help the airline reorganize and meet its financing agreements. 
American said it would also cut costs by closing 2 of 10 domestic reservations offices, affecting about 910 jobs in Norfolk, Va., and Las Vegas. 
The pilots' union at American, the Allied Pilots Association, said today that it was committed to helping the airline but was reserving judgment on the cost-cutting initiative. 
"What we have to do in the next few days is get a better understanding of how the numbers were arrived at," a union spokesman, Gregg Overman, said. 
The Association of Professional Flight Attendants said on its Web site that it wanted management to substantiate the need for cost savings and that meetings were set for Friday to explain how the $1.8 billion figure was reached. 
American has already identified $2 billion in annual savings. But the airline said today that it needed to cut expenses by twice that amount to keep its business afloat as competition from low-cost carriers reduces profits and market share. 
The risk that American will soon follow United Airlines, a division of the UAL Corporation, and US Airways into bankruptcy proceedings has risen considerably, analysts have said, as American burns through $5 million a day. 
Shares of AMR fell 8 cents, to $2.87.

HEADLINE: Toyota to Build Assembly Plant in Texas 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON with MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
Toyota Motor said today that its profits nearly doubled in the last quarter of 2002 and announced that it would build a new assembly plant in Texas to challenge the Big Three automakers in areas where they traditionally dominate.
 Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, plans to invest $800 million in the new factory in San Antonio. It expects to produce 150,000 Tundra pickup trucks a year when the plant opens in 2006. 
 Toyota already plans to open a plant in Mexico by 2005 to supplement the four other factories it operates in the United States and Canada. 
The planned expansion in North America, where Toyota sold a record 1.76 million cars last year, will help offset stagnant demand in Japan. New-car sales at home fell to a 20-year low in 2002 as rising unemployment and sliding wages push consumers toward smaller, cheaper cars. This shift has cut into sales of Toyota's broader lineup of full-size sedans. 
Thanks to Toyota's strong performance overseas, though, the growing challenge at home has not dented the company's overall performance. Toyota earned a better-than-expected 216 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in the October-to-December period, a 94 percent improvement from the period last year, the company said. Sales grew 13.2 percent, thanks to solid demand in Europe and the United States. 
Toyota's announcement of a new plant in Texas is the third new assembly plant to be announced or under construction in the United States, with all of them in the South. A Nissan plant will open in late May in Canton, Miss., producing a full-size pickup truck called the Titan, and a large sport utility vehicle. Nissan introduced the Titan at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January, and plans to show pictures of the S.U.V. to journalists at the Chicago Auto Show next week. Hyundai is building an assembly plant in Montgomery, Ala., that will build the next generation of its Sonata midsize car as well as the Santa Fe S.U.V. It will open in 2004.
The Toyota factory in San Antonio would be the most southerly of any American auto plant, posing some potential logistical challenges for the company, which relies on just-in-time delivery of components and keeps little inventory on hand at its factories. But Toyota officials said they could supply the plant from both the United States and Mexico, where a number of auto parts suppliers have factories. Among them is Delphi, the largest automotive manufacturing employer in Mexico, which counts Toyota as a major customer.
Company officials also noted that having opened assembly plants in Kentucky, Indiana and Canada over the last 15 years, along with engine plants in West Virginia and a soon-to-open engine plant in Alabama, the company already has experience in building a factory from scratch. 
Toyota, which holds more than 10 percent of the United States market, expects sales in America this year to decline only marginally, despite growing fears of an industrywide slowdown that could be set off by a war in Iraq or strikes by the United Auto Workers. "There are many if's," said Shin Kanada, a Toyota director. "But we can safely say the impact on our sales should be minor." 
Past experience may bear out Mr. Kanada's optimism. During the Persian Gulf war a decade ago, car sales in the United States fell more than 20 percent. Yet sales for Japanese automakers were relatively stable as consumers sought more fuel-efficient cars. Toyota and other Japanese carmakers may also benefit if labor talks slow production at General Motors, Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler. 
"If the talks between the Big Three and the U.A.W. get bogged down, Japanese automakers could be the unintended beneficiaries and walk away with the prize of higher market shares," said Noriyuki Matsushima, an analyst with Nikko Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo. 
The potential strife in America, where Toyota earns an estimated three-quarters of its profits, has put the focus back on the Japanese market, which is far less profitable. Toyota's share in Japan grew more than half a percentage point, to 43.6 percent, in the last quarter of the year as sales jumped 7.8 percent. 
Though Toyota's Corolla and Ist hatchback were among the top 10 best-selling cars last year, the Fit from Honda took top honors, displacing the Corolla for the first time in three decades. Rather than just chase rivals that are strong in the compact car market, Toyota is trying to emphasize its larger cars. Three of Toyota's minivans -- the Noa, Estima and Voxy -- were also in the top 10 last year. 
Though surveys show that Honda's StepWagon, another minivan, is the most sought-after car in Japan, Toyota is winning more customers because its broader lineup of cars includes hybrid models and a growing number of sports cars. The company is also overcoming its image as a maker of sturdy, but plain, cars. 
"I always felt Toyota's cars were the best quality, but did not have attractive designs," said Tomoya Senda, a businessman who stopped into a Toyota dealership in the Hatchobori business district to look at a Wish minivan for his wife. "But they enormously improved their designs, so they have nothing to fear from the competition."

HEADLINE: Young, Jobless, Hopeless 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
You see them in many parts of the city, hanging out on frigid street corners, skylarking at the malls or bowling alleys, hustling for money wherever they can, drifting in some cases into the devastating clutches of drug-selling, gang membership, prostitution and worse. 
 In Chicago there are nearly 100,000 young people, ages 16 to 24, who are out of work, out of school and all but out of hope. In New York City there are more than 200,000. Nationwide, according to a new study by a team from Northeastern University in Boston, the figure is a staggering 5.5 million and growing. 
 This army of undereducated, jobless young people, disconnected in most instances from society's mainstream, is restless and unhappy, and poses a severe long-term threat to the nation's well-being on many fronts. 
Audrey Roberts, a 17-year-old who just recently landed a job at a fast-food restaurant on Chicago's West Side, talked to me about some of the experiences she and her out-of-work friends have had to endure.
"The stuff you hear about on the news," she said, "that's our everyday life. I've seen girls get raped, beaten up. I saw a boy get his head blown away. That happened right in front of me. I said, 'Oh my God!' I just stood there."
The shooting was over a dice game that was being played one afternoon by boys who had nothing better to do with their time, she said.
It's an article of faith among politicians and members of the media that the recession we continue to experience is a mild one. But it has hit broad sections of the nation's young people with a ferocity that has left many of them stunned.
"I don't think I can take it much longer," said Angjell Brackins, a 19-year-old South Side resident. "I get up in the morning. I take a bath. I put on my clothes. I go outside."
She has tried for months to find a job, she said, filling out application after application, to no avail. "I'll do any kind of work if they'll just hire me. It doesn't matter, as long as it's a job." 
The report from Northeastern, titled "Left Behind in the Labor Market," found that joblessness among out-of-school youths between 16 and 24 had surged by 12 percent since the year 2000. Washington's mindless response to this burgeoning crisis has been to slash -- and in some cases eliminate -- the few struggling programs aimed at bolstering youth employment and training.
Education and career decisions made during the late teens and early 20's are crucial to the lifetime employment and earnings prospects of an individual. Those who do not do well during this period seldom catch up to the rest of the population.
"Our ability to generate family stability and safe communities is strongly influenced by this," said Dr. Andrew Sum, director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern and the lead author of the study. 
When you have 5 1/2 million young people wandering around without diplomas, without jobs and without prospects, you might as well hand them T-shirts to wear that say "We're Trouble."
Without help, they will not become part of a skilled work force. And they will become a drain on the nation's resources. One way or another, the rest of us will end up supporting them. 
"It's just heartbreaking," said Jack Wuest, who runs the Alternative Schools Network in Chicago, which commissioned the study. "These kids need a fair shake and they're not getting it."
The Bush administration, committed to a war with Iraq and obsessed with tax cuts for the wealthy, has no interest in these youngsters. And very few others in a position to help are willing to go to bat for them.
In a long series of conversations with young unemployed and undereducated Chicagoans, I did not hear much of anything in the way of aspirations. Whether boys or girls, men or women, those who were interviewed seemed for the most part already defeated. They did not talk about finding the perfect job. They did not talk about being in love and eventually marrying and raising a family. They did not express a desire to someday own their own home.
There was, to tell the truth, a remarkable absence of positive comments and emotions of any kind. There was a widespread sense of frustration, and some anger. But mostly there was just sadness.

Treasury to Add Auctions To Meet U.S. Budget Needs

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department said yesterday that it was reviving the three-year note, increasing quarterly sales of five-year notes and considering shifting to monthly five-year note auctions to cover rising budget deficits, which are projected to reach record levels this year and next year.
 The Treasury also said the government would bump up against its ceiling for issuing new debt around Feb. 20, another sign of rising red ink. If no increase in the current $6.4 trillion debt ceiling is approved by then, the Treasury said it could use "stopgap devices, some costly" to keep borrowing until the beginning of April. 
 "Prompt action by Congress to raise the debt ceiling is necessary to ensure success in our efforts to combat terrorism, continue the economic recovery and maintain the soundness of federal government securities," the Treasury Department statement on the debt limit said. 
Winning approval of debt ceiling increases from Congress has been difficult in the past, in part because it is an opportunity for grandstanding and hard bargaining. The last increase, approved in June, came more than six months after the first warning from the department and after the government used a variety of stopgap measures and delayed an auction. With Republicans in control of Congress and the threat of war with Iraq, the path might be easier.
In the quarterly auctions scheduled for next week, the Treasury plans to sell $24 billion in new five-year notes and $18 billion in new 10-year notes. That is the largest total for a quarterly auction since 1996.
Treasury prices rallied immediately after the announcement, pushing yields, which move in the opposite direction, lower. But yields began rising later in the morning as the stock market advanced, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell spoke to the United Nations Security Council, and, possibly, the expected increases in Treasury issuance began to weigh on the market.
In late trading, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note was at 3.99 percent, up from 3.93 percent on Tuesday. The price fell 19/32 , to 1001/32 . The yield on the Treasury's two-year note climbed to 1.70 percent yesterday from 1.67 percent on Tuesday.
In a briefing for reporters, Peter R. Fisher, the under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, wrestled with the tough political issue that comes with the rise in deficits: Will they push interest rates higher? He said no, pointing to data the Treasury prepared that shows that the Treasury market is a relatively small portion of the total credit market.
But many economists do agree that rising deficits, in some circumstances, can push interest rates higher.
In the fiscal 2004 budget announced on Monday, the Bush administration projected that the budget deficit this year would be a record $304.2 billion, and would widen to $307.4 billion in fiscal 2004, which begins Oct. 1.
Because the projections of borrowing needs are based on current law and not the new deficit projection, Treasury did not say exactly how it would handle the added borrowing in the future. But all the changes announced yesterday give it flexibility to respond to higher borrowing requirements, Mr. Fisher said.
The first auction of the revived three-year note will be in May and will then occur quarterly, for now. The Treasury did not say how large the three-year auction would be. The outside committee that advises the Treasury on borrowing, however, has recommended an auction of $20 billion. 
Besides giving the Treasury capacity for additional borrowing, the new three-year note would allow a reduction in the current borrowing in two-year notes and Treasury bills. The last auction for a three-year Treasury note was in May 1998.
The additional four auctions of five-year notes will be what are called reopenings of existing five-year notes. For example, after the five-year note sale at the May auction, more of that same note will be sold a month later, making it actually a four-year, 11-month note.
In the future, in addition to the shift to monthly auctions of five-year notes, the Treasury is also considering reopening 10-year notes as a way to increase borrowing.
Another change is an increase in the amount of inflation-protected securities the Treasury sells, but that may not be until next year.

HEADLINE: Growth and Employment in Services Rose Modestly Last Month 

BYLINE:  By Dow Jones/AP 

 BODY:
The service sector grew at a slightly stronger pace in January than in December, a private industry group said yesterday, amid the first increase in services hiring in nearly two years. 
 The group, the Institute for Supply Management, reported that its nonmanufacturing index for January rose to 54.5 from a downward-revised 54.2 reported for December. Readings above 50 in the nonmanufacturing index, which is made up mostly of services, indicate increases in activity and prices. 
 Economists had expected the index to hold essentially steady at 54.0. 
The services report followed the institute's manufacturing report on Monday, which showed expansion there at a slightly slower pace. 
Ralph G. Kauffman, director of the services survey, said: "In January, nonmanufacturing business activity increased for the 12th consecutive month. The reported growth indicates a slightly faster rate of expansion than reported in December."
Employment in services grew for the first time since February 2001, a break with the trend in manufacturing. The nonmanufacturing employment index was 50.3 for January, pointing to a growing pace of hiring over December's unrevised figure of 46.9. Prices for services also continued to rise, with that index reading 57.0 for January, after an upward-revised 55.3 in December. 
The institute said that respondents to the survey, even with the generally upbeat tone of the January report, remainedcautious. Some noted a very modest pickup in demand, while others said clients continued to hold off on committing themselves to new capital spending projects. 
Federal Reserve officials have said they are taking a wait-and-see approach to the matter of economic recovery, adding that much of the current uncertainty is linked to the threat of war with Iraq, among other things. A Fed governor, Ben S. Bernanke, indicated on Monday that he expected that once the uncertainty lifted, the economy was likely to start growing, perhaps in the second half of the year.

HEADLINE: Warning on Hitting Debt Ceiling Of $6.4 Trillion Around Feb. 20 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department warned today that the government would hit its $6.4 trillion debt ceiling around Feb. 20, and it urged Congress to increase the authority to borrow.
 The request was made as deficit projections have continued to increase. The move is likely to set off a battle, with Democrats' seizing the opportunity to accuse President Bush and his party of flawed fiscal policy. 
 Congress is still grappling with fiscal issues from last year. The House passed another stopgap spending measure tonight as senior lawmakers said negotiations were progressing on a huge spending bill that would clean up the unfinished business.
The new bill, which faces a Senate vote, will keep agencies running through Feb. 20. 
Members of the Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate said they hoped to wrap up by that date a $391 billion measure that would finally give most agencies a fixed revenue stream for the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. Military spending bills were the only such measures to pass last year.
"We are closing in on this," Representative C. W. Bill Young, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said as the House voted tonight.
Lawmakers said they were narrowing differences over Medicare payments, farm aid, education and other issues. They said they hoped to keep as low as possible an across-the-board spending cut instituted by the Senate to cover extra initiatives.
Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that if Congress could not complete the overall spending bill by next week, it should just pass a measure financing agencies at the 2002 level through the rest of the year.
"Finish it now or forget it," Mr. Stevens said.
Such an approach would pose a hardship to agencies that are anticipating increases but would appeal to fiscal conservatives who want to hold down spending.
Mr. Young predicted that lawmakers were not going to be happy with the final product. 
"I don't think any of us is going to like it," he said.

Hiring Hits Worst Slump In U.S. in Almost 20 Years
The economy has fallen into its worst hiring slump in almost 20 years, and many executives say they remain unsure when it will end. More than two million jobs have been lost since March 2001. About one million people appear to have dropped out of the labor force since last summer, the government reports.
 The surge in discouraged workers is the most significant since the months after the Sept. 11 attacks. It suggests that the pain of joblessness has worsened even though the unemployment rate, which counts only people looking for work, held steady. Page A1.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Military manpower and leadership are pluses, but battles are hard to predict.

BYLINE:  By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger is the Bendheim professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University and a co-editor of The Journal of the European Economic Association. E-mail:akrueger@princeton.edu.

 BODY:
DONALD H. RUMSFELD, the defense secretary, and his top generals are vigorously debating the number of troops to deploy in the event of a second Persian Gulf war. Coalition forces numbered 795,000 in the 1991 war. Mr. Rumsfeld has argued that far fewer American troops -- no more than 100,000 -- are needed to defeat Saddam Hussein's armies this time around because of the revolution in military technology and Iraq's weakened state, while the military brass is not so sure, and prefers at least 250,000. 
 News reports say they have agreed to split the difference and put around 175,000 troops in the region, with 100,000 or more reinforcements available if needed. 
 What does it take to produce a military victory? 
A crucial concept in economics is the production function: certain inputs must be combined to produce desired outputs. This idea has been applied to military battles by Ralph Rotte of the University of Technology in Aachen, Germany, and Christoph Schmidt, president of the Rhine-Westphalia Institute for Economic Research in Essen, Germany. Their study, "On the Production of Victory: Empirical Determinants of Battlefield Success in Modern War," turns up some provocative findings.
Using data from the Army Concepts Analysis Agency, Professors Rotte and Schmidt classify 625 battles according to whether they were won or lost by the attackers. They construct a statistical model, known as a probit equation, to determine which factors make victory more likely. Both objective factors, like the size of the forces, and subjective ones, like troop morale and leadership skills, are used to predict victory. Battles spanning a long sweep of history, from 1600 to 1973, are studied to allow for changes in military technology. 
They find that outnumbering one's opponent is a significant determinant of victory -- and that the advantage from having more troops is virtually as strong since the start of World War II as it was from 1600 to 1849, despite changes in technology.
As in many industries, however, there are "declining marginal returns" from manpower. That is, having an additional 10,000 soldiers helps an attacking army less if it already had twice as many troops as the defending army than it would if both sides had been close to parity. 
Of course, the downside of a larger deployment is that more troops are in harm's way. In addition, research by Joshua D. Angrist of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and John H. Johnson IV of the University of Illinois finds that deployment disrupts family life; soldiers deployed in the gulf war in 1991 were more likely to become divorced than those not deployed.
Although the relative number of troops is a determinantof victory, Professors Rotte and Schmidt find that troop morale and leaders' tactical skills are even more important. Because morale and leadership skills are judged ex post facto by military experts who have the benefit of knowing which side won, they are wary about ascribing too much weight to these factors. 
In most battles neither side has a clear technological advantage. When there is a difference, the professors find that having the technological edge does not raise the likelihood of victory. Having superior intelligence and the element of surprise, by contrast, count toward victory.
Consider Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo. With 68,000 men, Napoleon faced the Duke of Wellington with a combined English and Prussian force of 137,000. French intelligence underestimated the Prussians' fighting abilities, and Napoleon was surprised by their swift appearance on the battlefield. The Rotte-Schmidt statistical model gives Napoleon only an 18 percent chance of prevailing. They calculate that had the Prussians not arrived, leaving Napoleon to face Wellington's 66,000 men alone, his chances would have risen, but to just 26 percent. The reason for the long odds is that the duke was rated a superior leader at that stage of their careers; had the advantage been reversed, Napoleon would have been predicted to prevail. 
So leadership, morale, troop size and intelligence have historically counted for more than technology. Do these conclusions apply to 21st-century conflicts?
There are limits. The prism of history may distort judgments of morale and leadership. Moreover, armies facing an overwhelming opponent may have avoided conflict, leaving only a select sample of battles where the outcome was uncertain. And it is certainly possible that the latest weaponry -- including precision-guided munitions, stealth bombers, thermal imaging, compound armor and drones -- give far more of a technological edge than the innovation of mobile infantry combat gave Napoleon. 
Still, the statistics reinforce doubts many defense scholars have about the latest "revolution in military affairs." Stephen D. Biddle of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, for example, cogently argues that technology was only a part of the reason for the decisive victory in 1991; skilled manpower and technology enabled coalition forces to exploit monumental Iraqi mistakes, which may not recur in another invasion. Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution notes that despite superior technology, America lost in Vietnam and Somalia. 
The generals who study past battles have probably drawn the same conclusions through intuition that Professors Rotte and Schmidt draw from statistics. That may explain their insistence on a large force.
So one other conclusion is worth emphasizing: victory is hard to predict. The factors that Professors Rotte and Schmidt identified improve the prediction of which side won by only around 25 percent over random guesses. It is wise to recall Napoleon's assessment on the eve of Waterloo: "I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad soldiers; we will settle the matter by lunchtime."

HEADLINE: HIRING IN NATION HITS WORST SLUMP IN NEARLY 20 YEARS 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
The economy has fallen into its worst hiring slump in almost 20 years, and many business executives say they remain unsure when it will end.
 The employment decline has become even worse than it was at a comparable point in the so-called jobless recovery of the early 1990's, according to recently revised statistics from the Labor Department. The economy has lost more than two million jobs, a drop of 1.5 percent, since the most recent recession began in March 2001, as layoffs have continued despite the resumption of economic growth more than a year ago. The decline was 1.3 percent at the same point in the business cycle a decade ago. 
 About one million people appear to have dropped out of the labor force since last summer, neither working nor looking for a job, according to government figures. 
The surge in discouraged workers is the most significant since the months immediately after the recession's start. This suggests that the pain of joblessness has worsened even though the official unemployment rate, which counts only people looking for work, held steady at 6 percent in December.
"Last year," said Tom Koehn, 50, who lost his job at a machinery maker in South Bend, Ind., in May, "I heard a lot of people say, 'Come back after the first of the year; if the economy picks up, we might hire some people.' But so far, I haven't found anybody who's hiring."
The shortage of jobs has also slowed wage growth so that only workers in the most affluent groups are still gaining ground on inflation, ending a six-year streak of broad increases in buying power.
Manufacturers of durable goods like computers, furniture and steel have made the deepest cuts, with one of every nine jobs in these industries eliminated since early 2001. Airlines, brokerage firms and makers of clothing and textiles have also each cut at least a tenth of their work forces. Government agencies have been among the few employers that continue to expand, although many states are now laying off employees to close budget deficits.
Executives say they have been disappointed too many times by the halting growth of the last year to begin hiring workers in significant numbers. While the government is likely to report tomorrow that the economy added some jobs in January, many executives are still waiting to be convinced that business has regained a solid footing after the collapse of the bubble of the late 1990's. 
The possibility of a war with Iraq and an increase in oil prices offers another reason for hesitation, they say. Many companies have also used new technologies and management techniques to produce more with the same number of employees.
"This is what I call the new reality," said Robert M. Dutkowsky, the chief executive of J. D. Edwards, a software maker in Denver that has kept its work force at 5,000 people for the last few years. "The environment we're operating in is what it's going to be like for a while."
In his State of the Union address last week, President Bush called the improvement of the job market his "first goal" for the coming year and asked Congress to pass a $670 billion, 10-year tax cut.
"We must have an economy that grows fast enough to employ every man and woman who seeks a job," Mr. Bush said. "With unemployment rising, our nation needs more small businesses to open, more companies to invest and expand, more employers to put up the sign that says, 'Help Wanted.' "
Most economists say that the tax plan and another $4 billion in help for the jobless would have only a small effect on the economy this year.
The number of companies cutting jobs has spiked since November, with AOL Time Warner, Boeing, Dow Jones, Eastman Kodak, Goodyear, J. C. Penney, McDonald's, Merrill Lynch, Sara Lee, and Verizon all announcing new layoffs. Barring a sustained rise in oil prices, however, the cuts appear likely to taper off in the coming months as the economy continues its slow recovery, most forecasters say.
The bigger problem seems to be the unwillingness of companies to hire new workers. In December, the number of help-wanted advertisements in newspapers across the country fell to the lowest level in almost 40 years, according to the Conference Board, a research group in New York.
"There isn't the confidence level in business today that we need for growth," said Cinda Hallman, chief executive of the Spherion Corporation, a staffing company based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that places almost 400,000 people in jobs, down from 600,000 three years ago. "There's uncertainty. Companies are being much more cautious than they used to be."
The labor market entered the 2001 recession tighter than it had been in 30 years, with the jobless rate falling below 4 percent in late 2000. Even at 6 percent -- its level in December, the most recent reading -- it remains lower than it was during the aftermath of most other recessions.
But the reluctance of companies to hire is causing pain in ways that the jobless rate does not measure.
An unusually large number of today's unemployed have been out of work for months, including Mr. Koehn, the South Bend manufacturing worker, who lost his job last spring. Almost 1.9 million people still looking for work have been unemployed for at least six months, triple the number of two years ago.
"There are a lot of people out there who aren't used to asking for help who need some help," said Mr. Koehn, who plans on applying to convenience stores if he has not found other work before his jobless benefits expire in mid-February. "It's a tough pill to swallow when people say, 'Oh, you still haven't found work,' and you know you've been looking."
Many other people seem to have stopped looking. Since June, the number of adults not in the labor force has jumped by more than one million, to 72.4 million, according to the Labor Department. Many are retired, still in school or raising children, but the sharp change suggests that a growing number have become too frustrated to continue applying.
"I went out and pounded the pavement faithfully," said Theresa H. Washington, who lost her $60,000-a-year electrician's job more than a year ago at a Cleveland steel mill closed by the LTV Corporation. "I did the whole nine yards in terms of looking for work, and I never had an interview.
"There is no job market right now," Ms. Washington, 47, added. She estimated that she had applied to more than 50 companies.
In May, she enrolled in a community college and is studying to become a counselor to people addicted to alcohol or drugs, a job that will pay about $40,000 a year. Until she finishes the program in May 2004, she and her two children will rely on extended jobless benefits of about $370 a week, a local health care clinic, a food bank and help from friends and family, she said.
"It's been a complete change in lifestyle," she added.
The prolonged jobs slump has also taken away much of the bargaining power that workers had in the 1990's. 
Qualcomm, the technology company based in San Diego, receives 200 resumes a day, up almost 25 percent from a year ago, and the applicants are generally more qualified than in the past, said Daniel Sullivan, executive vice president for human resources.
At 7-Eleven stores, employee turnover remains high, but it has fallen in the last year. "One of our biggest challenges was getting people," said James W. Keyes, 7-Eleven's chief executive. Now, he said, "it's much, much easier to both recruit and retain employees."
With little need for companies to compete for workers, wage growth has ground almost to a halt, after inflation takes its bite, for people in the bottom of the income distribution. That is a sharp reversal from the late 1990's, when low unemployment and increases in the minimum wage allowed low-income workers to receive bigger proportional raises than those in the middle.
Workers at the 20th percentile of earners made $8.31 an hourat the end of last year, up only 1.1 percent from a year earlier, according to an analysis of government data by the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal group in Washington. Over the same span, inflation was about 2.2 percent.
The median worker -- the one falling squarely in the middle of the distribution -- received a 2.1 percent raise over the same span, to $13.36. The top third of earners received increases of about 2.7 percent. 
In the late 1990's and 2000, workers near the bottom were receiving annual raises of more than 4 percent, slightly better than the increases for those at the median or for most of those near the top.
The economy has shown signs of picking up in recent weeks, including a survey of service-sector managers released yesterday that showed their business improved in January. But the hints of recovery are difficult to distinguish from ones that proved false in the last year or so, executives say. Many companies still have more stores and factories than they can profitably use, and little need to add new workers.
The effects of the bubble of the late 90's in the stock market and business investment will eventually wear off, but the recent increases in corporate efficiency appear to have created a long-term change in the level of economic growth needed for an improving job market. The economy advanced 2.8 percent from the end of 2001 to the end of last year, which was once a growth rate capable of generating demand for tens of thousands of new workers a month. Yet payrolls still declined significantly, as companies used both new technologies and strategies forced on them by an increasingly competitive economy to produce more goods and services with fewer people.
In the last few years, for example, Applebee's, the restaurant chain based in Overland Park, Kan., has centralized its purchasing of food to save costs and begun varying the pay of its workers more than it had been, in order to retain the most productive ones. The steps have allowed its sales to grow faster than its employment, said Lloyd L. Hill, the chief executive.
"It's not brain surgery," Mr. Hill said. "We just recognized we had to do better."
BASF, the world's largest chemical company, spent $4 billion investing in new plants and equipment in the United States in the last five years. Like many companies, it will turn to its new machines to increase production.
"Now," said Klaus Peter Lobbe, who runs BASF's North American operations, "comes the time to make the assets sweat."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Growth Without Jobs"The 1990-91 recession, which began in July 1990 and continued for three quarters, was deeper than the 2001 recession. But in the recent recovery, even more jobs have been lost than during the so-called jobless recovery of the early 1990's. And lately more people have stayed unemployed or left the work force than in the comparable period a decade earlier.

HEADLINE: Health Insurance for All (and Meaning It) 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Forcing all Americans to buy health coverage would not drive down coverage. As the laws of economics tell, increase the demand, and the prices will go up. 
 Ted Halstead's plan (Op-Ed, Jan. 31) would force millions of Americans who have made a choice about their needs to buy coverage they may or may not need. 
 In addition, his suggestion that Americans would get better care from the insurance companies once everyone was forced to buy it flies in the face of experience.
If Mr. Halstead's insurance companies want "young and relatively healthy Americans" to buy health insurance, they should focus on lowering the price rather than forcing the government to cover its shortfalls.

HEADLINE: Guilty Plea Due Today In Big United Way Theft 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
A former vice president for finance at the United Way in Lansing, Mich., will plead guilty in a federal court today, her lawyer said yesterday, in the largest embezzlement ever at a United Way. 
 Brian P. Morley, the lawyer for the defendant, Jacquelyn Allen-MacGregor, said she had spent the money -- $1.9 million -- on her passion, quarter horses. 
 Daniel Y. Mekaru, the assistant United States attorney handling the case in Grand Rapids, would not comment on details of the plea agreement.
But Mr. Morley said Ms. Allen-MacGregor, who resigned from her post in November, had agreed to plead guilty to charges of stealing roughly half a million dollars through the forging of checks. 
Officials of the Lansing charity, the Capital Area United Way, say she actually took almost four times that amount over the last seven years, which is as far back as its banks have retained certain records that could account for any missing money.
Mr. Morley said Ms. Allen-MacGregor, who faces up to 10 years in prison on each of two counts, would not oppose the charity's efforts to recoup that full amount by seizing and selling her assets, which include interests in some 70 quarter horses.
"She loves horses," Mr. Morley said in explaining her motivation. "She has told me her dream day would be to be in the barn from 7 a.m. until 7 p.m."
Ms. Allen-MacGregor embezzled even more than William Aramony, former president of the United Way of America, whose $1.2 million fraud sent him to prison for seven years and dealt a crippling blow to the national organization.
In an interview in Lansing last Thursday, Tom Chirgwin, regional president of Comerica Bank, who became chairman of the Capital Area United Way just as the scandal there broke several weeks ago, said of Ms. Allen-MacGregor, "She stole from the 55,000 people who were donors, but worse than that, she stole from 120,000 people who get assistance from the agencies we support."
Ms. Allen-MacGregor, who worked for the United Way for 20 years, did not need to be a criminal mastermind to succeed in the theft. She simply wrote checks to herself, forging the signatures of the required co-signers and destroying the canceled checks when the bank mailed them back. No one noticed this, because she also kept the organization's books. Letters from the United Way's auditor suggest that she covered up the losses by inflating the reported amount of pledges that were unfulfilled.
"This was so basic," said David Brower, controller at Michigan State University, who is on an independent committee advising the United Way about methods of improving financial oversight. "This wasn't an elaborate scheme. This was a case of anorganization with a small number of staff members putting too much trust in an individual."
Bob Berning, who amid the scandal resigned on Monday as president of the Capital Area United Way, blamed the organization's auditor, Maner, Costerisan & Ellis, for failing to uncover the theft.
But Maner bristles at the suggestion that it is at fault.
"This went on prior to our being engaged in 1999, and when you have fraud going on a long time, it's hard to find because it has become the norm," said Bruce J. Dunn, the partner responsible for overseeing audits of the organization.
A letter dated May 17, 2001, that accompanied the firm's second audit suggests that the United Way had continued to allow Ms. Allen-MacGregor to reconcile the bank statements on checks she had written, a practice that Maner had warned against a year earlier.
Mr. Berning, who worked for the Capital Area United Way for 23 years, said he or R. Paul McConaughy, the organization's senior vice president, had "reviewed" bank reconciliations.
"It is unclear to me why the recommendation was repeated after the 2000 audit," he said, "since I believe reconciliation reviews were being done."
But Mr. Brower, the member of the committee of financial advisers to the organization, said that was not so.
"Someone was given responsibility for that," he said, "but they weren't doing it."
Ms. Allen-MacGregor's scheme would have been much harder to get away with had someone else reconciled the bank statements, since it relied heavily on her ability to remove the checks she had written to herself and destroy them. Since the scandal broke, an accounting firm has begun doing reconciliation.
Mr. Berning noted that Maner did not attach a letter with recommendations to its latest audit, covering 2001, "which we understood to be a clean bill of health."
Mr. Dunn, the Maner partner, said no such conclusion should be drawn. In that Maner audit, the standard letter that accompanies every audit noted that the firm had had to make 14 adjustments to the United Way's journal entries concerning pledges payable and receivable. It wrote that those adjustments "did have a significant effect on the Capital Area United Way Inc.'s financial reporting process."
Every United Way must estimate what percentage of pledges made to it will not be honored, and experts on nonprofit accounting say those estimates are the most difficult to make and the most open to abuse. The Lansing charity's pledge losses had increased in recent years, but the leadership believed that this was attributable to the economic downturn and corporate consolidation.
Instead, Ms. Allen-MacGregor was hiding her crime by adding the amounts she was stealing to pledge losses.
She left the organization on Nov. 15. The United Way said she had resigned for reasons unrelated to her crime, but Mr. Morley, her lawyer, said she had been asked to leave. "It's my understanding it was more of a quit-or-be-fired situation," he said.
In December, Cathy Adcock-Davis succeeded Ms. Allen-MacGregor and stumbled onto the loss while familiarizing herself with the United Way's finances.
"It was Dec. 17," Mr. Berning said, "at about 2 minutes to 12. Cathy came into my office with three checks, and they were all made out to Jackie Allen-MacGregor. My heart just went to my feet."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 8, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about embezzlement charges against Jacquelyn Allen-MacGregor, a former officer of the United Way in Lansing, Mich., referred incorrectly to a recommendation made in letters from the organization's auditor and in some copies, because of an editing error, misstated a comment by David Brower, a financial adviser, about the advice. The auditor advised that someone review Ms. Allen-MacGregor's reconciliation of bank statements -- not that someone other than she reconcile them. Mr. Brower said the recommendation had not been followed; he did not say it had been.
In some copies the article misstated the title of Tom Chirgwin, the new chairman of the organization. He is a regional president of Comerica Bank, not the president.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
An intelligence breakthrough in the last several weeks made it possible for Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to set forth the first evidence of what he said was a well developed cell of Al Qaeda operating out of Baghdad that was responsible for the assassination of the American diplomat Laurence Foley last October.
 The breakthrough was the work of a coalition of intelligence services from the United States, Britain, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, according to a senior official from one of the coalition countries. 
 The Qaeda network based in Iraq has operated for the last eight months under the supervision of Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian of Palestinian origin who is also a veteran of the Afghan war against the former Soviet Union, Mr. Powell said. 
Critical information about the network emerged from interrogations of captured cell members conducted under unspecified circumstances of psychological pressure, the coalition official said. But a lucky break also figured prominently -- a satellite phone conversation gave away the location of a Qaeda operative, Mr. Zarqawi's deputy, driving out of Iraq. 
Until about three weeks ago, Mr. Powell was said to be reluctant to go before the Security Council with a case connecting Al Qaeda with the Iraqi leadership. "Colin did not want to be accused of fabricating or stretching the truth," a coalition official said. 
That all changed, the official said, when the interrogation of Mr. Zarqawi's deputy began to yield the first detailed account of the network's operations in Iraq, the Middle East and Europe. 
The network was planning terrorist attacks in a half dozen European countries, Mr. Powell said, adding that recent police raids in France and Britain, where one police officer was killed, stem from the disruption of the Iraq-based network. About 116 operatives have been connected to it, he said. 
When all the shards of intelligence came together today, along with new information on Iraq's secret programs to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, Mr. Powell's presentation was a more detailed and well-documented bill of particulars than many had expected. 
Mr. Powell said that after Mr. Zarqawi fought against the Soviets, he returned to Afghanistan at the peak of Mr. bin Laden's influence in 2000 and ran a training camp. His leg injury during the allied military campaign in 2001 may have been serious enough for amputation by the time he reached Baghdad. 
An expert in poisons and chemical weapons, Mr. Zarqawi is believed to have been providing training to the extremist group Ansar al-Islam. The group is based in northeastern Iraq in territory that is neither under the control of the Baghdad regime nor the main Kurdish groups that have divided up most of northern Iraq. 
Soon after Mr. Zarqawi arrived, Mr. Powell said, "nearly two dozen extremists converged on Baghdad and established a base of operations there."
He continued, "These Al Qaeda affiliates, based in Baghdad, now coordinate the movement of people, money and supplies into and throughout Iraq for his network, and they are now operating freely in the capital for more than eight months." 
Coalition officials said that no group could operate in this manner without deep engagement with Iraq's ubiquitous intelligence services. 
Mr. Powell withheld some critical details today, like the discovery by the intelligence agencies that a member of the royal family in Qatar, an important ally providing air bases and a command headquarters for the American military, operated a safe house for Mr. Zarqawi when he transited the country going in and out of Afghanistan.
The Qatari royal family member was Abdul Karim al-Thani, the coalition official said. The official added that Mr. al-Thani provided Qatari passports and more than $1 million in a special bank account to finance the network.
Mr. al-Thani, who has no government position, is, according to officials in the gulf, a deeply religious member of the royal family who has provided charitable support for militant causes for years and has denied knowing that his contributions went toward terrorist operations. 
Private support from prominent Qataris to Al Qaeda is a sensitive issue that is said to infuriate George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence. After the Sept. 11 attacks, another senior Qaeda operative, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who may have been the principal planner of the assault on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, was said by Saudi intelligence officials to have spent two weeks in late 2001 hiding in Qatar, with the help of prominent patrons, after he escaped from Kuwait. 
But with Qatar providing the United States military with its most significant air operations center for action against Iraq, the Pentagon has cautioned against a strong diplomatic response from Washington, American and coalition officials say. 
The issue of whether Al Qaeda's terror network is linked with Iraq had been a contentious part of the debate over the justification for war. Some experts have sought to undermine the Bush administration's rationale for war by asking how a war against Iraq relates to the Sept. 11 terror attacks. The administration's theory is that the threat from Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction could merge with the large-scale terror tactics of Al Qaeda to pose an unacceptable threat.
The unraveling of the Qaeda story in Iraq, still under way, took on some of the drama of an espionage thriller when, following the murder of Mr. Foley, the Qaeda deputy to Mr. Zarqawi suffered a lapse of communications discipline, a coalition official said. As he drove across northern Iraq to the Turkish and Syrian frontiers, he could not resist using his satellite phone to call Mr. Foley's murderers to congratulate them and to tell them he was on his way to meet with them. 
"The captured assassin says his cell received money and weapons from Zarqawi for that murder," Mr. Powell said. In December, Jordan said it had two men in custody who had confessed to killing Mr. Foley on the instructions of Mr. Zarqawi. 
Western intelligence is withholding the name of the captured Zarqawi deputy. However, they swiftly detected the satellite phone signal and tracked the operative to Syria and then into Turkey, where he was arrested and transported to one of the interrogation centers that the C.I.A. is operating in the region.
The decision to identify Mr. Zarqawi, still at large in Iraq, as the leader of a Qaeda cell will put his life in jeopardy because Mr. Hussein has insisted that Baghdad has no links with Osama bin Laden's network. 
"A half hour after Powell mentioned his name, I'll wager he disappears or is killed," said a coalition official, recalling the death in Baghdad in 2001 of the Palestinian terrorist Abu Nidal, after intelligence reports suggested than he might be activating his own terrorist network.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: 9/11 Aid For Nonprofit Groups 

BYLINE:  By David W. Chen (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 Two groups announced yesterday that they would provide emergency loans of as much as $25,000 and other financial aid for nonprofit organizations hurt by the September 2001 terror attack. 
The groups, the United Way of New York City and Seedco, a community development organization, said they would provide $9.5 million in loans and technical assistance to nonprofit groups in Lower Manhattan and other neighborhoods financially hobbled by the attack. The groups said the aid, including longer-term loans of up to $500,000, would be provided at below-market interest rates over the next three years. Information is available at (212) 473-0255.

HEADLINE: French Bank Says It Will Seek Acquisitionsin Western U.S. 

BYLINE:  By KERRY SHAW 

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
The chairman of BNP Paribas, Michel Pebereau, said today that the bank would seek to make acquisitions in the Western United States as he ruled out a possible merger with a rival French bank, Societe Generale.
 Speculation about BNP's next step has been rife since December, when Credit Agricole and Credit Lyonnais agreed to merge in a deal that would vault the new bank past BNP as France's largest. 
 A spokeswoman for BNP, Carine Laru, would not comment on which banks BNP might be looking at, but did say that the company was focusing on its already significant interest in the region. 
"One has to have a policy that is opportunistic and disciplined at the same time," she said.
Indeed, there is little urgency for the bank to do a deal immediately. BNP has remained relatively unscathed by the market slump, weak underwriting and economic slowdown that have roiled most big European banks. BNP today reported a 20 percent decline in fourth-quarter earnings, to 696 million euros ($758 million) from 866 million euros. Revenue fell 4.5 percent, to 4.2 billion euros. And corporate and investment banking earnings fell sharply.
But the results exceeded analysts' forecasts, bolstered by a strong performance in retail banking, both at home and abroad. In trading in Paris, shares of BNP Paribas rose nearly 4 percent today, to 38.03 euros ($41.39) a share.
BNP already has a strong presence on the West Coast of the United States. It became the fifth-largest bank in California after buying United California Bank from Japan for $2.4 billion last year. BNP then merged that business with its BancWest unit, bringing its total of West Coast customers to 1.5 million. 
Philippe Ricarte, an analyst with KBC Securities France, praised BNP's strategy of giving autonomy to its managers in the United States. 
"I think the American market is mature enough to not need intervention from French banks," he said. "That's not bad politics, and so far that has been their strategy."
BNP also repeated today that it might counter Credit Agricole's bid to buy Credit Lyonnais, France's sixth-largest bank, for 56 euros a share. BNP has until the middle of this month to decide. 
"The decisions regarding the 16.2 percent holding in Credit Lyonnais, acquired for an average share price of 54.7 euros, will be taken at the appropriate time," BNP said.

HEADLINE: Putin Meets Pakistani, Ending Long Breach 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
Ending a 30-year diplomatic estrangement, the presidents of Pakistan and Russia met in the Kremlin today and pledged a fresh start to relations after decades of alliances with each other's sworn enemies.
 But the reconciliation was tempered by the Kremlin's announcement that President Vladimir V. Putin had telephoned the prime minister of Pakistan's still-bitter enemy, India, apparently to reassure him that today's meeting would not affect their close ties. 
 Mr. Putin and Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, signed a handful of diplomatic and cultural accords at today's two-hour session, which ran more than twice its scheduled length. Mr. Putin hinted that the two nations would sign new economic agreements on Thursday. 
They also discussed the Iraq crisis, and Mr. Putin said afterward that the two had agreed that the United Nations Security Council "should play a central coordinating role in resolving international problems." 
While both men said that increasing trade was a primary goal of their meeting, terrorism is clearly the force that has driven the warming in their relations. Pakistan and Russia have found themselves allied with the United States in the effort to curb terrorism in central and south Asia, on Russia's southern flank, and Mr. Putin called today for the two nations' law-enforcement agencies to cooperate more closely on terrorism issues. 
General Musharraf addressed a major Russian concern by acknowledging in an interview that fighters from Russia's separatist Chechen republic had been allied with the Taliban in Afghanistan, and that representatives of Chechen guerrillas would not find sanctuary in Pakistan. 
"We will not permit anybody who organizes terrorist acts to visit Pakistan," he said in an interview in the Moscow daily Izvestia. "That does not apply to Chechens alone." 
Today's discussions were also said to have centered on Pakistan's dispute with India over Kashmir, the India-controlled region claimed by both nations. Mr. Putin was reported to have urged General Musharraf again to stanch the flow of Islamic guerrillas over the so-called line of control, the shaky cease-fire zone separating Pakistan and disputed Kashmiri territory held by India. 
Russia and Pakistan have not been friendly for years. But judging by the quips the two men exchanged today, things went well. Mr. Putin said he was not surprised the meeting ran well past its scheduled end. "The last visit of a Pakistani president to our country took place 33 years ago," he said. "We have a vast agenda to discuss."
For his part, General Musharraf -- who scrapes bottom in some Pakistani opinion polls -- feigned jealousy over Mr. Putin's status as something close to an idol among the Russian masses. A chart-busting song last year by a pop singing group of Russian women, titled "Someone Like Putin," extolled Mr. Putin as a model Russian male. 
"I want a man like Putin, who doesn't drink, a man like Putin who wouldn't hurt me," the lyrics wailed. 
"No one sings pop songs about me," General Musharraf lamented as talks between the two men began. 
Mr. Putin replied, "I have to put up with everything."

Pressing Case, Powell, Presents Evidence to U.N.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, pressing the American case for a possible war to disarm Iraq, presented photographs, intercepts of conversations between Iraqi military officers and information from defectors aimed at proving that Saddam Hussein poses an imminent danger to the world. A1

A significant intelligence breakthrough in the last several weeks made it possible for Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to set forth the first evidence of what he said was a well developed cell of Al Qaeda operating out of Baghdad that was responsible for the assassination last October of the American diplomat Laurence Foley. A1

To persuade allied nations that Mr. Hussein is trying to deceive United Nations weapon inspectors, the Bush administration applied a tried and true strategy: it sought to overwhelm the critics with evidence. A1

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Choice Says He's No Harvey Pitt 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
William H. Donaldson, President Bush's latest choice to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, won broad bipartisan support today at a confirmation hearing after repeatedly assuring lawmakers that he would be significantly different from his predecessor.
 Democratic and Republican lawmakers said after the hearing that they expected him to be confirmed soon to succeed Harvey L. Pitt, who announced his resignation three months ago but has continued to lead the commission during one of its busiest periods. 
 Mr. Donaldson told the Senate Banking Committee that his first priority would be to work with his colleagues to find a candidate quickly to head the new accounting oversight board and that he would begin looking for one on his first day on the job. He said his primary role would be to restore investor confidence in markets shattered by an Internet bubble, weak earnings, corporate scandals, terrorism and the prospect of war. 
"Just as the war on terrorism cannot be won overnight, neither can investor confidence be completely restored so quickly," Mr. Donaldson said. "Corporate America, Wall Street and their professional stewards -- lawyers, accountants, corporate and financial managers, and financial regulators -- still have much work to do."
"The S.E.C. has been through a very trying time," he said. "The recent scandals have depleted their morale and taxed their resources like never before. If confirmed, I will work closely with the agency staff to enhance their sense of dedication and pride and restore the stature of this agency." 
Mr. Donaldson struck a noncontroversial stance on a variety of important regulatory issues, declining to disclose his views on the details of an array of items under consideration by the commission and other regulatory organizations.
He said, for instance, that he supported accurate accounting of stock options given to executives. But he did not say how that should be done. He said he was committed to continuing the commission's consideration of whether it should regulate hedge funds more tightly. But he did not say what sort of regulation might be needed. 
He said it was important for the agency to continue investigating conflicts of interest on Wall Street involving the commercial and investment banking arms of major firms, as well as conflicts involving stock analysts who report on companies that are also their firm's clients. But he did not suggest any new steps the commission should take after a recent $1 billion settlement it reached with the nation's biggest brokerage firms.
Once critical of a regulation that requires companies to share significant information with investors on a nondiscriminatory basis, he said today that he supported the rule, known as Regulation FD, and would not propose changing it.
During his tenure, Mr. Pitt seemed haunted by his predecessor, Arthur Levitt, and determined not to follow in his footsteps. Mr. Pitt said at the outset of his term that he would seek to be less confrontational than Mr. Levitt, and privately he was critical of a number of regulations Mr. Levitt adopted.
Today, in turn, Mr. Donaldson sought to distinguish himself from Mr. Pitt, promising to restore morale at the S.E.C., in recent times a deeply demoralized agency. Time and again during the nearly three-hour hearing, he implicitly and explicitly committed himself to being different from Mr. Pitt and to avoiding his missteps. 
Pressed gently by both Republicans and Democrats, Mr. Donaldson pledged that he would be independent of his former ties on Wall Street. He vowed to fight aggressively for a large budget for the agency. He promised that he would not meet with executives of companies under investigation. And he promised to work closely with all his fellow commissioners in selecting a new head of the accounting oversight board, a decision that Mr. Pitt fumbled, ultimately leading to his resignation.
Mr. Donaldson was a studied contrast to Mr. Pitt in other ways. He appeared both more politically polished and less interested in the minutiae of securities regulations than Mr. Pitt, who came to the commission after a career as a highly successful Wall Street lawyer.
In the fall of 2001, at the outset of his tenure, Mr. Pitt told a prominent group of accountants that he had once represented in private practice that he planned to reduce what he saw as the hostile tone of the agency toward the profession. In contrast, Mr. Donaldson was urged today to be particularly aggressive.
"Now is the time for you to put some fear in people," said Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. "Even as you come out of Wall Street, people need to understand you are not one of them now."
"I surely understand the independence of this agency," Mr. Donaldson replied. "I also understand my independence, no matter where I come from."
He deflected a handful of questions raised primarily by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, the ranking Democrat on the committee, about his tenure as head of the New York Stock Exchange and, later, as the top executive at Aetna. In the 1990's, while he was at the stock exchange, a series of improper trading activities occurred.
Also during that time, Mr. Donaldson waged an unsuccessful battle with Richard C. Breeden, the S.E.C. chairman, seeking to induce the agency to permit foreign companies with different and sometimes lower accounting standards to list their shares on the exchange.
Mr. Donaldson said he had urged an end to some abusive trading practices and was unaware of others that were later uncovered. He said he sought to have the foreign companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange because he wanted to give American investors interested in the foreign companies the protections afforded under United States laws.
He defended the $19 million in compensation he received as chief executive at Aetna for 13 months by noting that the company's board devised a series of objectives that he had satisfied.
"My compensation was strongly aligned with shareholder interests," he said.

HEADLINE: Taking Steps TowardGoal Of No Tax For Investors 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 

 BODY:
Piece by piece, President Bush's new tax proposals would go a long way toward achieving a goal cherished by many of his top advisers: eliminating taxes on investment income.
 White House officials insist that their proposals are not part of a comprehensive plan to push through a fundamental overhaul of the tax system. The goal, they say, is simply to encourage savings and eliminate obstacles to investment. 
 The intent of the proposed tax-free savings accounts, Pamela F. Olson, the assistant secretary of the Treasury in charge of tax policy, said when the plans were presented last week is to "make saving simple for everyone and for every purpose." 
But experts say the myriad changes would do much more by shielding the vast bulk of most individuals' investment income. "It's a comprehensive tax shelter," said Alan J. Auerbach, a tax expert at the University of California at Berkeley. "It's huge, but the costs don't show up in the budget as being huge."
President Bush personally unveiled the White House proposal to eliminate taxes on most corporate dividends, a move that would cost the Treasury $300 billion over 10 years. That would be the first big step in making investment income tax-free.
But more important, in the view of many experts, is Mr. Bush's even newer but much less trumpeted proposal to revamp and expand the nation's laws on tax-advantaged individual retirement accounts.
Under that proposal, a married couple with two children would be able to put up to $45,000 a year into a class of individual retirement and savings accounts. They would still have to pay taxes when they earned the income, but they would never have to pay taxes on any of the money that accumulated in their accounts after that.
The new retirement plans would shield much more than income from stock dividends. They would also shelter interest from bank certificates of deposit and corporate bonds, and they would eliminate taxes on profits from all kinds of investments held in the new accounts.
"This proposal is simply a Trojan horse to get us to the point where we don't tax investment income," said Representative Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota, who has studied retirement issues for years.
At least as envisioned thus far, people would even be able to take home-equity loans on their houses, deduct their payments of mortgage interest and put the money in a "retirement savings account" or a "lifetime savings account," where it could earn tax-free profits indefinitely.
The costs to the Treasury would be minimal for the next few years, but they could be huge over the long run as investment income built up and remained tax-free forever.
Administration officials have not provided any long-term price tag for the new retirement proposals. Because people will be encouraged to move money from the current individual retirement accounts to the newer plans, the Bush administration estimates that the measure will actually generate an additional $15 billion in tax revenue over the next five years. But after 15 or 20 years, experts say, the new plans would reduce tax revenues by many times that much money every year.
The political prospects for the administration's plans remain far from clear. Congressional Democrats are adamantly opposed to the dividend tax proposal, and many Republicans are uncomfortable with it as well.
The retirement plan, announced late last week, is so new that Republicans are just beginning to digest the ideas. Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said on Tuesday that he would take up the retirement proposals only after dealing with Mr. Bush's original economic package, which includes the dividend tax cut.
The retirement plan has already received support from lobbyists for the securities industry, which sees rich new opportunities for marketing new individual retirement plans and selling the securities to go in them.
But insurance companies are expected to fight the idea because the new plans would undermine the tax advantages that many life insurance policies offer in sheltering the investment income that builds up from premium payments.
States and city governments may fight both the dividend and the retirement proposals because both measures would diminish the tax advantage that municipal bonds have long enjoyed over corporate bonds and stocks.
On the other hand, the popular appeal of Mr. Bush's proposals could trump much of the resistance. Though only a tiny percentage of taxpayers receive more than a few hundred dollars a year in taxable stock dividends, millions of people could be attracted to the saving and retirement plans.
Each individual would be allowed to contribute up to $7,500 a year from earnings, and each couple could contribute $15,000, into a retirement savings account.
The "lifetime savings accounts" would be even more alluring. Each individual in a family could contribute up to $7,500 a year from any source. So a family of four could put aside $30,000, and the family would be free to withdraw money for any purpose at any time.
The lifetime accounts could even be used as checking accounts, used to pay daily expenses but also accumulating tax-free interest.
If approved by Congress, all of this would go a long way toward reaching a broad goal of senior White House advisers, which is to move from today's complex tax system to a much simpler system based on either a flat-rate income tax or a consumption tax, a form of sales tax.
Investment income would inherently be excluded from taxation under a system dominated by a consumption tax. A flat-tax system would not necessarily exclude investment income from taxation, though most of the proposals offered in the past have proposed just that. In any event, a flat-tax system that eliminated most deductions would apply a much lower tax rate than the one imposed at present.
The big difference between Mr. Bush's current proposals and most of the academic plans for a radical tax overhaul is that the bigger plans would eliminate tax breaks like the mortgage interest deduction. Mr. Bush's proposals end the taxation on much, if not most, investment income, but they do not offset that with any new tax on currently protected items like home borrowing, charitable contributions and state taxes. 
R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, is a fan of fundamental tax overhaul and has written extensively about how a consumption tax could work. But he said the new proposals were not yet part of a broader plan.
"The president is a pretty straight shooter," Mr. Hubbard remarked last month. "If he wanted fundamental tax reform right now, he would have said so."

HEADLINE: Delta to Alter Check-In, Using More Machines 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN STELLIN 

 BODY:
Seeking to eliminate at least one of the lines passengers have to endure at the airport, Delta Air Lines announced a plan yesterday to modify its procedures at 81 airports in hopes of ensuring that most customers do not have to wait more than two minutes to check in, even at peak times.
 Delta plans to spend up to $30 million this year to redesign itsairport lobbies, adding more than 400 self-service check-in machines to the 400 it now has and reassigning customer service agents to roles directing passengers to the fastest check-in alternative and helping those who need additional assistance. 
 Delta also plans to install phone banks in airport lobbies that will connect customers who have complicated requests to telephone reservations agents, who the airline says can typically handle ticketing changes much faster than agents at the airport. Customers who use the phones will be able to obtain boarding passes from a printer near the phone bank. 
"The whole airport will look dramatically different than it does today," said Rob Maruster, director of airport strategy and service for Delta, which has been testing its lobby concept for the last several months at LaGuardia Airport in New York.
The initiative was first reported yesterday in USA Today. In a sense, Delta is playing catch-up with some competitors, which have already made a big push to install self-service technology. Continental Airlines, for instance, currently has 683 automated check-in machines in 113 airports, and last year more than 60 percent of its domestic passengers took advantage of this option.
Other airlines at the forefront of this trend include Northwest, which has 643 self-service check-in units in 145 airports; American, with 613 machines in 77 airports, and Alaska Airlines, with 379 machines at 74 airports. All three carriers report that about 40 percent of their fliers take advantage of self-service check-in, compared with 25 percent for Delta, which aims to increase that to 50 percent by year's end.
In addition to the self-service check-in machines at airports, Delta, Northwest, American, Alaska and US Airways also allow passengers to check in online and to print boarding passes from a home or office computer, in some cases up to 30 hours before a flight. That option has been slower to catch on with travelers, though several airlines have begun promoting Web check-in through advertising campaigns.
Across the industry, the push toward self-service is being encouraged by a number of factors, not least the need to cut costs in hard economic times. A Delta spokesman, John Kennedy, acknowledged that the airport changes were part of plans to reduce costs $2.5 billion by 2005. Delta has also announced that it will eliminate 7,000 to 8,000 jobs throughout the company, and Mr. Kennedy said, "Certainly, these initiatives have taken into consideration that overall head count."
Although these changes may suggest less personal attention at the airport, so far there does not seem to be much objection from customers, perhaps because the technology offers the prospect of a faster check-in process at a time when security procedures are taking more time. And with the new Transportation Security Administration increasingly requiring passengers to have boarding passes, not just e-ticket receipts, before passing through security, the airlines have moved to provide self-service alternatives to fliers. 
Still, airlines stress that customer service agents are not disappearing and that passengers who want more attention can find it. "Rather than a traditional ticket agent waiting for a customer to come to them, you'll see more employees in front of the counter taking a more proactive role before the customer even tries to get in a line," said Richard Cordell, Delta's senior vice president for airport customer service.

Executive Pay Cuts
ATLANTA, Feb. 5 (Bloomberg News) -- Delta will cut pay 8 percent for most executives and 10 percent for its chief executive, Leo F. Mullin, and its president, Frederick W. Reid, on March 1, the company said in a memo to United States employees.
Delta may also lower employee wages to be competitive with carriers that have filed for bankruptcy protection, Mr. Mullin said today at a Goldman, Sachs transportation conference. The memo, sent on Tuesday, said pay cuts were not being considered this year for nonunion workers.
Mr. Mullin said wage rates would need to be competitive with those at United Airlines and US Airways, which are reorganizing under bankruptcy protection. "Delta cannot be a high-wage payer vis-a-vis other airlines," Mr. Mullin said at the conference, "and expect also to survive outside of bankruptcy so there will be some further work on that."

HEADLINE: Getting Rich Off Human Cargo: The Grim Details 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Four centuries of trading in slaves, as many as 13 million Africans, left a legacy of horrifying cruelty, but it also tied three continents together in a complex and systematic commercial enterprise that fattened coffers on both sides of the Atlantic.
 Now, fresh details of the lucrative business that entwined Europe, America and Africa are being shown in "Captive Passage," an exhibition that opened this week at the Anacostia Museum and Center for African American History and Culture in Washington. Using hundreds of items -- books, charts, maps, drawings, shipping manifests -- culled from several collections, as well as two films, the exhibition shows the slave trade as a gruesomely efficient enterprise that was integral to the economies of many countries. 
 "Captive Passage: The Transatlantic Slave Trade and the Making of the Americas" was organized by the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Va., with support from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Rockefeller Foundation. After its stop in Washington, the exhibition is to travel to other American cities, including New York. 
John B. Hightower, president of the Mariners' Museum, said he had been inspired to take a new look at his museum's vast maritime collection after seeing a similar exhibition in Liverpool, England, once a main port serving the slave trade.
"The forced migration of millions of enslaved Africans has not been told in sufficient detail," Mr. Hightower said. "Nor has it been given the visceral impact it needs, and we are trying to do that."
"Most other exhibits have shown the conditions of slavery," he continued, "but this really focuses on slave trade as a remarkable and grim economic engine that went on for 400 years."
Nearly every Western European country trafficked in slaves, sending ships to Africa with guns, ammunition, rum and other goods to be traded for humans. Thousands of ships plied the Atlantic, transporting captured men, women and children to the Americas in deplorable conditions. The ship captains sold their human cargo to eager American slave traders. They were often respected men like the New York merchant Philip Livingston, who signed the Declaration of Independence and gave money to Yale University.
Slavers returned to their home ports with material that enslaved Africans had produced in Caribbean cane fields and on sprawling plantations in the American South. Europeans needed sugar for coffee and tea, tobacco for smoking, cotton for clothes and tropical hardwood to make furniture. Cotton was among the raw materials imported from the New World to enable European factories and mills to turn out the goods to purchase more Africans with.
The exhibition is "telling a story of critical importance," said Steven Newsome, who directs the Anacostia Museum, part of the Smithsonian Institution. "There is no question that the labor of enslaved Africans was crucial to the rapid development of the Americas, laying the foundation for its fantastic wealth and prominence in the world economy."
The slave trade was underway by the early 1500's, when Europeans had made contact with African slave traders to obtain labor for their colonial outposts. England, Spain, France, the Netherlands and Denmark, among other nations, filled their treasuries with this money. Stock companies, shareholders and insurers all saw the slave trade as an entirely honorable business, the exhibition emphasizes.
The tentacles of this traffic extended to resource-poor Rhode Island, which by the 1740's had developed a large export business in rum, importing the necessary molasses and sugar from the West Indies. To ensure that the islands' plantation system was supplied with slave labor, Rhode Island's ships were sent to import African slaves.
By the end of the 17th century, England's Royal African Company alone had exchanged cloth, beads, iron and rum for 175,000 captured Africans, according to a companion book to the exhibition published by the Smithsonian and the Mariners' Museum. 
Intent on maximizing their profits, slavers almost literally stacked Africans in their ships. In "Revelations of a Slave Smuggler," an 1860 book on view, Richard Drake described loading a boat so completely that not only was the hold crammed, but 50 slaves were also "tied around the mast and rails" so that "every available foot of space had been covered with black flesh."
The wretched conditions the shackled captives endured during the "Middle Passage" across the Atlantic are portrayed in one of the films that are part of the exhibition. In these ships, the lives of slaves were claimed by lack of sanitation, smallpox and other diseases, and despair that drove some to suicide during voyages that typically lasted between 30 and 50 days. "Tight packing" (an actual technical term, as opposed to "loose packing"), shown in a French artist's pen-and-ink drawing from 1784, allowed disease to spread rapidly. But the slavers were satisfied if enough slaves survived to make them a high profit. 
The exhibition, whose opening coincides with Black History Month, remains at the Anacostia Museum (1901 Fort Place SE, Washington) through Aug. 21.

HEADLINE: THEATER GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show. + means discounted tickets were at the TheaterDevelopment Fund's TKTS booth for performances last Friday and Saturday nights. ++ means tickets were at the booth for last Friday night only.

Broadway

* "LA BOHEME." Baz Luhrmann's rapturous reimagining of Puccini's opera of love in a garret turns out to be both the coolest and the warmest show in town, an enchanted mixture of self-conscious artistry and emotional richness. Opera purists should know that this production is no slice of wiseguy revisionism. What Mr. Luhrmann and his extraordinary production designer, Catherine Martin, have done is to find the visual equivalent for the sensual beauty and vigor of the score. The stars of this "Boheme" may be as pretty as Calvin Klein models, but their voices for the most part match their faces. And while Mr. Luhrmann and Ms. Martin have brought a defiantly stagy sense of theatricality to the cinema with films like "Romeo and Juliet" and "Moulin Rouge," they have reversed the equation with "La Boheme," bringing to the theater a seductive cinematic flow. The three rotating sets of principals are, to a person, sexy, vital and utterly committed to the moment (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $41.25 to $101.25; a limited number of $20 rush tickets are available at the box office two hours before the performance (Ben Brantley).

* "TARTUFFE." The look of love beams like a laser from the eyes of Brian Bedford in this handsome, absorbing revival of Moliere's comedy from the Roundabout Theater Company. As the fatuous Orgon, the bourgeois gentilhomme who takes the serpent named Tartuffe (Henry Goodman) into the bosom of his family, the truly wondrous Mr. Bedford presents a beatific study in denial, a man whose midlife crisis takes the form of a besotted pursuit of spiritual enlightenment. While guilty of a few instances of forced comic shtick, Mr. Goodman, who suggests John Barrymore being sinister, cannily plays the religious charlatan Tartuffe as a Svengali who has thoroughly and contemptuously hypnotized his victim. The rest of the agreeable cast, which includes J. Smith-Cameron and Kathryn Meisle, isn't on the same virtuosic level. But John Lee Beatty's period sets are exceedingly good looking. Mr. Bedford and Mr. Goodman turn out to be the most arrestingly odd couple on Broadway this season (2:15). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $65 (Brantley).

Off Broadway

*+ "BEDBOUND." Words are oxygen for the breath-starved characters in Enda Walsh's whiskey shot of a play. For the seedy father and sickly daughter who are the sole inhabitants of this brusque, exciting new drama, language has become nothing short of a basic biological function. As they work their frantic, fumbling ways through narratives of their lives, these unlikely, reluctant bedmates sometimes choke and gag on the words that spew and sputter out of them like blood from a freshly opened vein. But as the girl makes clear, silence equals panic; words are all that keeps them alive. "Bedbound" sent happy shivers through London critics when it opened at the Royal Court Theater there last year, and the New York production, directed by Mr. Walsh, doesn't disappoint. Acted with mesmerizing energy and precision by Brian F. O'Byrne and Jenna Lamia, "Bedbound" emerges as a genuine and bracing original among the already well-stocked shelves of word-drunk Irish plays (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, (212) 727-2737. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $40 (Brantley).

++ "COMEDIANS." Few sights are more painful for an audience than a stand-up comic who can't get a laugh. Yet Trevor Griffiths's 1975 play, which has been given an intense and earnest revival by the New Group, insists that you experience that pain as a succession of would-be professional comics disastrously try out their routines. The show asks you to consider coldly what you might normally laugh at and why. As one of the play's characters puts it in all sincerity: "Comedy is medicine." And this story of a night class for comedians holds a mirror up to theatergoers and asks them to confront the sick souls therein. As such plays can be, it is intelligent, daring and, in the long run, less abrasive than tedious, like a jittery lecture at high volume. This despite the presence of a talent-rich, hard-working ensemble led by Jim Dale, Raul Esparza and David McCallum (2:45). Acorn, 410 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35 to $50 (Brantley).

"COOKIN' AT THE COOKERY." When the blues singer Alberta Hunter died in 1984, she had been working until her last few months. In a remarkable coda to a remarkable life, she had come out of a self-imposed retirement from the stage -- two decades in which she worked as a licensed practical nurse on Roosevelt Island -- to perform at the Cookery in Greenwich Village. It was a six-week gig that turned into an indefinitely extended one. That was in 1977, when she was 82. This is the starting point for Marion J. Caffey's feel-good pocket musical for two lively actresses and a stoic four-man band. It isn't terribly dramatic or even melodramatic, but it is staged with clever economy, and it has a worthy subject and a heart of gold. The music, of course, is terrific, and the performances of Ann Duquesnay and Debra Walton are full of warmth and verve (1:55). Theater 3, 311 West 43rd Street, (212) 279-4200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Bruce Weber).

"JULIUS CAESAR." Like a lot of intelligent people, Shakespeare was amazed at the paradox of political speech: that it is demonstrably misleading and that people believe it anyway. This is the bizarre trope of human nature that "Julius Caesar" deals with especially. And because politics is never without purveyors of egregious, self-serving lies, the play is perpetually relevant. Though it doesn't have the psychological depth of "Hamlet," it can really make you outraged. Outrage appears to be very much on the mind of the director, Karin Coonrod, whose "Caesar" reads as a protest against the Republican oligarchy in Washington. From the opening scenes in this modern-dress production, the director uses the costuming and manner of her actors to evoke the contemporary American nexus of conservative political power among the government, the military and the corporate elite. It's an overall approach that attenuates the grand debate over the future of Rome, making the usurping senators seem like gossip mongers in the halls of Enron; from the outset, this is a conspiracy more venal than noble. And it serves the show well at first as sly, wicked satire. Ultimately, however, the diminishment of the characters for partisan purposes doesn't serve the play, and the production descends into bombastic melodrama (2:00). Lucille Lortell Theater, 121 Christopher Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7:30; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 (Weber).

* "PANIC! (HOW TO BE HAPPY!)" Every winter the director Richard Foreman reassembles his idea of the interior of the human mind in ornate, puzzlelike dream houses of sets. And every winter pilgrims of the avant-garde show up for a dose of senses-scrambling spectacle, much as other people attend the Christmas show at Radio City Music Hall. As usual, Mr. Foreman portrays existence as a slapstick farce of exasperation. Pleasure-free human eroticism is given comically literal-minded representation here, in ways that suggest the work of an overzealous sex education teacher. The impeccably precise principal players, dressed up like the cast of a nightmare version of "The Pirates of Penzance," move and speak with the mannered zeal of automatons in search of their inner humanity. That Mr. Foreman continues to extract such joyous showmanship from his premise that life is futile remains one of the miracles of contemporary New York theater (1:15). Ontological Theater at St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 533-4650. Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $20; $15 student tickets available with valid identification (Brantley).

* "SHANGHAI MOON." Lady Sylvia Allington, the heroine of Charles Busch's happy, cockeyed new melodrama, may have an aristocratic title, but what makes her so appealing is that the lady is unmistakably a broad. This highly perfumed tale of East-meets-West romance, directed by Carl Andress, distills the essence of the broads who roamed the silver screen in the early talkies: scrappy, straight-talking dames like Barbara Stanwyck and Jean Harlow. That in "Shanghai Moon" the broad is embodied by a man is almost beside the point. Mr. Busch, who achieved mainstream fame as the author of "The Tale of the Allergist's Wife," shapes his Hollywood spoofs with a sweet fizziness that transcends camp. And this production -- which also stars Becky Ann Baker, Daniel Gerroll and the silky B. D. Wong as Sylvia's forbidden lover -- suggests a smart but affectionate fan's notes, written in bright crayon with lots of exclamation points (1:30). Greenwich House, 27 Barrow Street, (212) 633-9632. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 7 p.m. Tickets: $35; $45 beginning Tuesday (Brantley).

+ "TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE." Two well-cast and thoughtful actors, Jon Tenney and Alvin Epstein, fill the roles of callow young man and wise old man, respectively, in this adaptation of the sentimental best seller by Mitch Albom about a dying man's wisdom. They manage to do what Mr. Albom never did: infuse these two people with human qualities. But they still can't make the play anything but a maudlin, manipulative tear-jerker with the subtlety of a children's bedtime story and a complete absence of tension and conflict, which, from an audience perspective, keeps Morrie alive much longer than it has to (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, West Village, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $65 (Weber).

* "TWELFTH NIGHT" AND "UNCLE VANYA." A very winning pair of losers dominates these compelling, exotically twinned productions from the Donmar Warehouse of London, bringing new refinement to the popular art of disgruntledness. As embodied by Simon Russell Beale, perhaps the greatest stage actor of his generation, the ambitionless title character of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" and the ambition-riddled Malvolio of Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" unearth provocatively mixed layers of comedy and tragedy from what it means to be unlucky in love. Mr. Russell Beale is by no means the only reason to visit the plays, which run in repertory through March 9. The productions offer New York audiences a rare chance to see a first-rate ensemble -- which also features Emily Watson, Helen McCrory and Mark Strong -- working fluently in two entirely different theatrical idioms. With this "Vanya" and "Twelfth Night," among the most coveted tickets in London last year, the director Sam Mendes (who recently stepped down as the Donmar's artistic director) has shaped a valedictory ode to the varied possibilities of interpreting classics. The "Vanya" is a goosebump-making triumph of in-the-moment naturalism, with superb performances from everyone involved. If the pleasures of this "Twelfth Night" are more fitful, with a production that sacrifices authentic feeling to conceptual stylishness, there's a gratifying boldness in its very differences (2:45 each). Brooklyn Academy of Music, Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 7:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $30 to $75 (Brantley).

"THE WINTERS TALE." This was one of Shakespeare's last plays, and beginning with the title it overflows with the signals of resignation, accrued wisdom and compassion that attend age and experience. Consider its remarkably forgiving attitude toward Leontes, king of Sicilia, whose anomalous and tragically misguided fit of jealousy causes the deaths of his wife, Hermione, and their young son, Mamillius. Leontes earns redemption with 16 years of penitent grief, and the play rewards him by bringing Hermione back to life and returning to them their daughter, Perdita, also presumed dead. In Barry Edelstein's stirring new production, with David Straithairn in fine anguished form as Leontes, the world of the play is contemporary, post-9/11, and the idea of going on after a loss, after an inexplicable tragic occurrence, is paramount. Indeed, this Sicilia might well be New York City. The king's courtiers and their ladies seem to inhabit the roomy, spare downtown lofts of TriBeCa. The comic sections of the play, set across the sea in Bohemia, are less successful in this production -- among other reasons because Mr. Straithairn isn't in them -- but the closing scenes, back where the play begins, is a tableau that is tugged between joy and melancholy, one that looks, to an experienced, sagacious Elizabethan playwright -- not to mention many contemporary New Yorkers -- like life (3:00). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, (212) 677-4210. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $35-$50 (Weber).

Last Chance

+ "CLASS MOTHERS '68." Priscilla Lopez displays so much versatility in this one-woman play by Eric H. Weinberger that, oddly, a sort of audience fatigue takes hold midway through. The play, set in 1968, involves the planning for a silly show that some parents are staging for their graduating high school seniors. Ms. Lopez, a Tony Award winner for "A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine," portrays six mothers without intermission, and by mom No. 4 you begin to feel all mothered-out. At last, though, we meet Myrna, the sixth mother and the master planner of the parents' show, and her touchingly manic energy cancels out many of the earlier flaws (1:45). Clurman, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. Tonight at 8 p.m.; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $45 (Neil Genzlinger).

HEADLINE: FILM REVIEW; 
Ever-So-Clever Games of Love That End as Expected

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT 

 BODY:
I'll say this much for "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days": it is a little better than the two other recent high-concept romantic comedies based in New York, "Two Weeks Notice" and "Maid in Manhattan." This is largely because the writing is a bit sharper and the two stars, Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson, have a prickly, hot-and-cold chemistry. The screenplay is by Kristen Buckley and Brian Regan, who wrote "102 Dalmations," and Burr Steers, who wrote and directed "Igby Goes Down."
 An expert in the higher mathematics of the movie industry might come up with an equation to show how the treacly gruesomeness of "Dalmations" divided by the scabrous brilliance of "Igby" might yield the intermittently beguiling averageness of this movie, which opens nationwide today. The answer might lie in the smooth, ingratiating style of the director, Donald Petrie, who also did "Miss Congeniality" and "Mystic Pizza." 
 Ms. Hudson, who has been charming but not terribly exciting in movies like "Almost Famous" and "Dr. T and the Women," at last shows that she has inherited something more than blond good looks from her mother, Goldie Hawn. She has a similar knack for screwball sexiness, often ricocheting from bombshell to dingbat and back again in the course of a single scene. For his part, Mr. McConaughey steps into the role of comic foil with gentlemanly aplomb. You don't believe this scrubbed and gleaming pair are really the love-struck and ambitious young Manhattan professionals they are pretending to be, but for the most part the pretending is reasonably enjoyable to watch.
Ms. Hudson plays Andie Anderson, who writes how-to columns for a glossy women's magazine called Composure. A journalism school graduate, Andie yearns to write about more substantialtopics than shoes, orgasms and yoga, but her editor (a deliciously feline Bebe Neuwirth, who should have been given more to do) is no more interested in seriousness than the filmmakers themselves. Observing the romantic woes of a hapless co-worker (Kathryn Hahn), Andie decides to write the article that gives the movie its title. She will snare an eligible man and then, through a combination of clinginess, neediness and borderline psychotic behavior, drive him away.
Unknown to Andie, her designated mark, Ben Barry (Mr. McConaughey), has his own professional reasons for hanging around. His advertising firm is going after a big jewelry account, which he and his buddies want to wrest from a rival all-female creative team. To prove he can sell diamonds to women, Ben, an updated swinging bachelor from a Rock Hudson-Doris Day picture, must sell himself to one. His boss (Robert Klein, who has even less screen time than Ms. Neuwirth) gives Ben 10 days to make an eligible woman fall in love with him. So he and Andie, at clever cross-purposes, begin a cynical relationship, which almost too late turns into the real thing.
After this elaborate and promising setup, "How to Lose a Guy" manages to come up with a number of not terribly inspired but nonetheless well-executed funny bits. After her initial seduction of Ben, Andie turns into a needy, weepy, manipulative monster, sending him off to buy her a soda in the final seconds of a close Knicks game, sniffling over the rack of lamb Ben has prepared for their second date and giving his penis an embarrassing nickname. Ms. Hudson mugs and minces her way through these scenes with delighted shamelessness, and Mr. McConaughey makes a fine show of swallowing his exasperation.
If the movie provides no new insight into the contrasting behavior of men and women or the perils of postmodern urban dating, falling well shy of the not-too-high standard set by "Sex and the City" on both fronts, it does have its tart, fizzy moments. It also has the usual montages set to mediocre pop songs, and its soft, lovey-dovey passages feel particularly lazy. Of course, you know where it will all end, and the last 20 minutes, during which all of the picture's comic effervescence dissipates, might have been compressed or dispensed with altogether. After Andie and Ben perform a tuneless, furious duet of "You're So Vain" in front of a stunned and silent Marvin Hamlisch, there is a long, dreary stretch leading up to the obligatory boy-chases-girl-to-the-airport-as-she's-about-to-leave-town-forever sequence.
The chase gets as far as the middle of the Manhattan Bridge, and it is always nice when a movie set in New York appears to have actually been filmed here, rather than somewhere in Canada. The neighborhood locations and tourist sights are well chosen, though the light in the earnest, kissy scenes appears to have been imported from Hawaii. Even the most golden-hued New Yorkers never quite achieve the honey-dipped dewiness that Mr. McConaughey and Ms. Hudson occasionally display.
But they're movie stars, of course, and this is a romantic fantasy of New York in which the advertising and magazine industries are untouched by any hint of recession, the Knicks are in the N.B.A. finals and the Cinema Village, in reality one of the last holdouts of international avant-gardist film culture, is showing a chick flick marathon. This bit, which sets up an amusing fistfight between Ben and a sentimental giant, is a little piece of auto-homage on the part of the filmmakers. The marquee advertises "Sleepless in Seattle" (whose executive producer, Lynda Obst, also produced this movie), and Mr. Petrie's own "Mystic Pizza."
"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some discreet sexual references and scenes and some profanity.

HEADLINE: DRIVING; 
A Wagon Like Dad's, But Now I'm in Front

BYLINE:  By KIMBERLY STEVENS

 BODY:
FOR Steve Barnes, the search for the Brady-Bunch-mobile of his dreams became an all-consuming passion. After months of surfing the Web and culling through car magazines and newspaper advertisements, he decided to take the ultimate step and hire a private detective to find the elusive 1971 Dodge Monaco station wagon he was looking for.
 "I knew I needed professional help," he said. "It sounds wacky, but I really wanted to find that particular make and model, and I wasn't getting anywhere on my own." Mr. Barnes, 41, a mail carrier from Littleton, Colo., was shocked when just a few weeks later the detective presented him with a list of owners all over the United States. 
 After paying the detective $250, he bought a wagon, which was in mint condition, in Florida for $8,000. He and his wife, Cathi, drive it around town regularly, he said, and there's always enough room for their three English sheepdogs. 
"Some people have a midlife crisis and buy Porsche convertibles," Mr. Barnes said. "I went the other way."
He is not alone. In the cult of the station wagon, owners and enthusiasts often go to great lengths to find the wagons they grew up with, had their first dates in or owned in the years when they were starting their families.
For Mr. Barnes, it wasn't actually a desire to duplicate the car that appeared on "The Brady Bunch" (though it was the same model), but a quest for the car that got away. When he was 10, his father almost bought a bright white '71 Monaco wagon for $5,000 but at the last moment decided against it. "I remember playing with my brother in that car on the lot," he said. "We thought it was ours. I guess that car has been on my mind ever since."
And after all, didn't everyone have a station wagon? Classic models started gaining popularity in the 50's. By 1959, 17 percent of the cars produced in the United States were station wagons, according to Stationwagon.com, and their popularity held in the 60's and early 70's. The station wagon was synonymous with the postwar economic boom, large happy families and good times. Ozzie and Harriet whipped around the block in a brand new Pontiac wagon in their first season.
Then, when the gasoline crisis hit in 1974, station wagons lost some of their appeal. Manufacturer after manufacturer dropped them from product lines, and in a few more years minivans and sport utility vehicles began filling their old niche. By the 1990's, even station wagons from the 70's had mostly been driven into the ground and junked. Just when many boomers were looking for the vehicles that they associated with the happy days of childhood, those wagons had become rare.
That made the cars eligible to become collectibles, and gradually they did. They began appearing at auctions; clubs and Web sites sprang up; devotees held shows and meets. 
"Those wagons are classics," said Chris Winfrey, a 41-year-old history teacher from St. Louis who searched for months on the Internet before finding his 1966 Mercury Colony Park wagon. He bought it for $2,000 three years ago. "Just 10 years ago you'd have to pay a junkyard to come take it off your hands," he said, but now "things have turned around very quickly and the values are beginning to rise." 
Mr. Winfrey's wagon passion, like Mr. Barnes's, has a nostalgic connection. As a teenager he drove his grandfather's dark blue 1966 Pontiac Catalina wagon. "It was the ultimate party wagon as a teen," he said. "I could cram 15 friends in it and just cruise around town."
Rekindling happy memories is probably the best reason to buy an old station wagon, according to Richard Lentinello, editor of Hemmings Motor News. "No one should buy a station wagon for investment purposes, or they'll get burned," he said. "These cars were mass-produced, and they were just everyday cars that people took for granted. They've been used and abused." Values are rising because there are so few in good condition, he said, but the typical suburban station wagon will always stay at the bottom end of the ladder for serious car collectors.
The most prominent exception may be the woody wagons, which had wooden panels on the sides. The original station wagons go back to the turn of the 20th century. They were called depot hacks and were designed to transport luggage and passengers to and from train stations. Typically, they had partial wooden construction, a legacy of the horse-drawn wagons they replaced. From the 1930's to the 1950's, some station wagons made for family use had genuine wooden panels reminiscent of the utilitarian depot hacks, and they are the woodies many older Americans now fondly remember. (Later imitators had fake wood painted on, or even decals akin to adhesive shelf paper.)
According to Ken McDaniel, the president of the American Station Wagon Owners Association, a woody from the late 1940's, in mint condition, can fetch as much as $75,000.
Rob Kneen, 50, the owner of a travel agency in Mentor, Ohio, was motivated in his two-year search for a woody by fond memories of his mother driving a 1949 Ford woody (original cost, $1,300). He tracked down the same wagon in rural Tennessee about five years ago and paid $30,000 for it. A father and son team had meticulously restored it. Now, Mr. Kneen and his wife drive it in the summer and often have tailgate picnics, which attract a lot of attention.
His parents' woody wasn't always luxurious to ride in, he remembers. "Sometimes it smelled like rotten wood, because my parents never had a garage, so the car sat out in the harsh Midwestern winters, exposed to the elements," he said. "We had bees that actually would drill holes in the wood and make little nests in the car. I remember sitting in the back seat swatting at bees."
David Lee, a heavy-equipment mechanic from Fontana, Calif., said he has been searching for a 1959 two-door Ford Country Sedan for the last 20 years. "It was the car my parents owned when I was born," he said. His most recent buy was a 1959 Ford Edsel Villager. "There was this urban legend going around about a station wagon in mint condition that was sealed in the back of a truck in Riverside, Calif.," he said, chuckling. "It took me a year by word of mouth to find out that it was a true story, and I now own the car."
DAVE ZAPPONE, a 35-year-old actor, drives a 1977 Buick Estate Wagon that he has managed to get into two films: "Before Night Falls" and "Hysterical Blindness," an HBO movie. He also owns three Estate Wagons from other years, which he stores. He recently bought an eight-track tape player on eBay and put it in the 1977 model as a period accessory. His fondness for the cars goes back to high school, he said, when he inherited his family's 1976 Estate Wagon. "I remember I got teased a lot for driving the thing," he said. "Station wagons got no respect, but it was part of my identity."
The respect factor has changed. Mr. Kneen, who owns the woody, said what he liked most about driving a station wagon today was the warm response he got from strangers. He also owns a 1964 Oldsmobile station wagon, the same model as one he drove in high school. "It was a great date car," he said, pointing out that there is quite a bit of room to roll around in the front seat of a classic wagon. "Of course, in those days it was all G-rated activity," he added.
"I remember what it felt like to eat French fries in that car with my friends," he said. "It often all comes rushing back when I'm driving that car."
"I think we live in challenging times," he continued. "When people see me driving the wagon, they stop and smile and wave, and it clearly brings it all back for them as well."

HEADLINE: Britain and the Continent Part Ways on Rates; 
European Bank Opts To Leave Things Unchanged for Now

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
As Europe's political leaders part ways over whether to support an American attack on Iraq, the threat of war has put the European Central Bank into another kind of muddle.
 The bank said today that it would not lower interest rates, despite the shadow that a looming war is casting over the Continent's economy and despite the euro's recent rise in value against the dollar. 
 The global outlook is so murky, said the bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, that lowering rates now might not have the desired effect on economic activity. "We were afraid that if one were to cut at this moment, this would be a drop which would drown in a sea of uncertainties," he said. 
Mr. Duisenberg signaled that the bank would be open to reducing rates once the outlook became clearer.
The strengthening of Europe's common currency and the continuing economic weakness of Germany and some of its neighbors has renewed pressure on the bank to ease its monetary policy. But the bank seems hesitant to act yet, given the unpredictability of events in the Persian Gulf and the role that Europe might play in them.
"You have to consider various alternatives," Mr. Duisenberg said at a briefing here. "If there is a war, how long will it last? What will the repercussions be? We all, of course, keep thinking about it."
The one clear trend has been a flow of investment from the dollar to the euro. The euro, used by 12 of the 15 members of the European Union, rose to $1.083 today, resuming a climb that was interrupted briefly by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's speech at the United Nations on Wednesday.
Currency experts said the dollar was weak now because Mr. Powell had apparently not rallied the support of France, Germany and other countries for military action against Iraq. Some said that the euro was taking over the dollar's historic role as a refuge for investors in turbulent times.
Mr. Duisenberg alluded to this shift, which he described as a change in the "value judgments" made about the two currencies. "In the past, when there was geopolitical uncertainty, the dollar was the safe haven for the world," Mr. Duisenberg said. "Now it weighs on the dollar, rather than boosts it."
He noted that the euro was still trading slightly below its average value in 2000 and 2001, when it was used only in financial transactions; it began circulating publicly in January 2002. He insisted that the euro had not reached a level where it would pose a threat to exporters by making their goods too expensive abroad.
Analysts said the dollar would weaken further relative to the euro, particularly if the United States failed to muster support for its Iraq campaign and proceeded without a United Nations mandate.
"Compare the situation to 12 years ago, when Germany paid a large part of the cost of the gulf war," said Carsten Fritsch, a currency analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "If the U.S. fails to build a broad-based coalition, it will have to finance this war by itself."
Mr. Fritsch predicted that the euro would rise to $1.10 in the next few weeks, and could settle at about $1.18 as the federal deficit grows larger.
Such predictions do not comfort officials in Germany, where exports account for what little economic growth there is. The German economics minister, Wolfgang Clement, called for a rate cut to bolster commerce.
With his term as president winding down, Mr. Duisenberg is eager for clarity in more than economic matters. He expressed frustration at the fresh legal troubles of his designated successor, Jean-Claude Trichet. 
On Wednesday, a French prosecutor recommended that Mr. Trichet, the governor of the French central bank, be given a 10-month suspended jail sentence for his role in a state bailout of Credit Lyonnais, a major French bank. Mr. Trichet is on trial in Paris along with nine other defendants on charges of helping Credit Lyonnais publish false financial statements in 1992, when he was a French Treasury official. The bank's reports that year seriously understated losses.
Legal experts said a conviction would disqualify Mr. Trichet from taking the helm of the European Central Bank. The panel of judges hearing the case is expected to deliberate for several weeks after hearings are scheduled to conclude next Wednesday before handing down a verdict.
"I regret that this process is dragging on for such a long time," Mr. Duisenberg said. "That's never good -- not for a person, not for the institutions he represents, not for the issues that he and I are concerned about."

HEADLINE: Ericsson Names Head of Lock Company as Its Next Chief 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Ericsson, the struggling maker of telecommunications equipment, appointed an executive with no telecommunications experience today to succeed Kurt Hellstroem, its president and chief executive.
 The executive, Carl-Henric Svanberg, 50, is the chief executive of Assa Abloy, a Swedish lock manufacturer. He will assume his new duties at Ericsson's annual meeting on April 8, the company said. Mr. Hellstroem, 59, will stay until the end of the year to help smooth the transition, and then retire. 
 Ericsson's fortunes have deteriorated under Mr. Hellstroem's leadership despite a sweeping cost-cutting program meant to get the company, which is based in Stockholm, back into profitability this year. But executives said the management change was part of an orderly succession plan, not a reflection of Mr. Hellstroem's stewardship.
Analysts had been expecting Mr. Hellstroem to depart this year because he will turn 60 in December, the company's usual retirement age, but few expected the announcement so soon.
Michael Treschow, Ericsson's chairman, said in an interview that Mr. Hellstroem had approached him in October about retiring sometime this year, as his contract permits. "We discussed the timing and decided that the shareholders meeting would be the right time to make the change," Mr. Treschow said.
Finding a replacement was less simple. Mr. Treschow said that the Ericsson board initially wanted to appoint an internal candidate, but did not find one with the right combination of experience and expertise. So the directors turned to Mr. Svanberg, who had won the admiration of peers by building Assa Abloy into the world's largest lock maker through acquisitions.
The powerful Wallenberg family, whose holding company, Investor, owns 5 percent of Ericsson and holds 38 percent of its voting rights, also had a hand in selecting Mr. Svanberg. Marcus Wallenberg, the chief executive of Investor, said today through a spokesman, "We believe Carl is a good choice."
Other investors, who have become increasingly frustrated with Ericsson's performance, welcomed the change by bidding up the company's nonvoting Class B shares 4 percent, to 6.15 Swedish kronor (73 American cents) in Stockholm. Ericsson's American depository receipts, which represent 10 Class B shares each, rose 7.6 percent, to close at $7.23 in New York.
Analysts said Mr. Svanberg had the right combination of salesmanship and leadership to steer Ericsson through what is proving to be a long and painful slump in telecommunications.
He is making a personal commitment to the company, investing 100 million kronor ($11.8 million) in Class B stock.
Most of Ericsson's major customers, typically mobile phone operators and large corporations, are delaying purchases of network equipment while they wait out the economic downturn. And consumers who buy Ericsson's phone handsets have been slow to trade in old models for newer ones with advanced digital features like the ability to download video clips from the Internet.
In contrast to Mr. Hellstroem, who often found himself on the defensive when he fielded questions from analysts and reporters, Mr. Svanberg is known as a more affable executive, analysts said.
"Ericsson has impeccable technological know-how and an enviable customer base," Per Lindberg of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein said. "What it has lacked is a clear, transparent communication style, which is what Mr. Svanberg will bring to the company."
Other analysts wondered whether Mr. Svanberg's experience at Assa Abloy, which was created through a 1994 merger of Mr. Svanberg's former employer, Securitas of Sweden, and Metra of Finland, has prepared him for the challenges he will face at Ericsson.
That merger placed Mr. Svanberg in charge of the combined companies. During his tenure, sales grew sixfold, to 25.4 billion kronor ($3 billion), mainly through acquisitions. Assa Abloy reported today that pretax profit jumped 17 percent in the fourth quarter to 547 million kronor ($65 million).
In contrast, Ericsson has been retrenching. Despite its cost-cutting efforts, including laying off nearly half its workers, Ericsson lost 8.3 billion kronor ($970 million) in the fourth quarter, more than twice the figure recorded in the period a year earlier.
Mr. Treschow said that Mr. Svanberg would have to make stemming the losses his first order of business. "Carl's marching order is to continue our ambition of returning to profit," Mr. Treschow said.
Thomas Langer, an analyst with WestLB Panmure, said that while the appointment of Mr. Svanberg was a positive step, further management changes were necessary.
"Simply relying on the old guard will not do," Mr. Langer said. "It will be important to see a string of changes."
Mr. Hellstroem's departure from Ericsson will end a 19-year career at the company. He became president in 1999 and chief executive in 2001.
Mr. Svanberg will be Ericsson's fourthchief executive in five years. Noting that he would like to see more stability in Ericsson's top management position, Mr. Treschow said that given his age, Mr. Svanberg could conceivably lead the company through the next decade.
"He is a long-term solution," Mr. Treschow said.

HEADLINE: Sales at Retailers Last Month Were at Low End of Forecasts 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Retailers posted January sales today at the low end of expectations, but some of the biggest names, including Wal-Mart Stores, nudged up profit forecasts as they kept costs down.
 January is traditionally a lackluster month for retailers, which turn to clearance sales to get rid of leftover holiday merchandise and to make room for spring clothing. But many stores kept inventories lean before the holidays, leaving less merchandise to discount, bad for bargain hunters but good for profits. 
 Over all, sales in January increased 1 percent, Goldman, Sachs & Company reported, after a 0.9 percent increase in December. The increase in January 2002 was 3.4 percent. 
Sears, Roebuck, the largest department store chain, bucked the trend by forecasting first-quarter profit far below Wall Street estimates. Its sales at stores open at least a year -- a crucial measure of retail health known as same-store sales -- dropped 8 percent in January.
"It's really a tale of two cities," said Bill Dreher, a retail analyst with WR Hambrecht, "where the winners like Wal-Mart and Target are able to survive and thrive, almost, in this environment, while some of the laggards, like Sears and BJ's, are struggling to find their place in the retail sector."
Wal-Mart, the discount retailer, said its sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.3 percent in January, although that was at the low end of the company's 2 percent to 4 percent forecast. Still, Wal-Mart said it expected earnings for the year ended Jan. 31 would be about $1.80, slightly higher than the average of analysts' estimates of $1.78 a share reported by Thomson First Call. 
"It looked like their sales were at the low end of the range so they must be getting better margins than expected," said James Luke, who manages BB&T Asset Management's large-cap growth fund.
The J. C. Penney Company also raised its quarterly earnings forecast, even as its January sales fell a worse-than-expected 3.8 percent. The company expects to earn at least 65 cents a share in the fourth quarter. Analysts on average were looking for a profit of 63 cents a share, according to First Call.
Gap Inc., the owner of the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains, also predicted that quarterly earnings would top analysts' expectations as its January sales at stores open at least a year increased 16 percent. 
The Gap said it now expected to earn 23 cents to 29 cents a share in the fourth quarter, aided by a lower tax rate. Analysts had expected earnings of 16 cents a share, according to First Call. 
Target, the discount chain, said its January sales dipped 0.4 percent, below its expectations. 
"Although our sales momentum is relatively weak, our financial performance for 2002 remains on track," Target said, pointing to strong gross margins and higher profits in its credit card operations.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Fall, With 2 Indexes at Their Lowest Since October

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A tepid productivity report gave investors more reasons to sell yesterday, sending shares moderately lower and carrying the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to levels not seen in nearly four months.
 Analysts said trading was uneven as investors made short-term bets on whether or when the United States would wage war on Iraq. Tensions with North Korea also put pressure on the market. 
 "It's been sloppy and choppy in the last few sessions as speculative trading entered the fray," said Bryan Piskorowski, market commentator at Prudential Securities. "The lackluster productivity figures are definitely not a step in the right direction." 
"There's a massive wait-and-see mentality here, not only on Wall Street but Main Street as well," Mr. Piskorowski added. 
The Dow fell 55.88 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 7,929.30, for a three-day loss of 180 points. The average is at the lowest level since Oct. 14, when it finished at 7,877.40. 
The broader market finished mixed. The S.& P. 500 dropped 5.44 points, or 0.6 percent, to 838.15, the lowest since Oct. 11, when it closed at 835.32. The Nasdaq index inched up 0.23 point, or 0.02 percent, to 1,301.73. 
Two economic reports, particularly one showing sluggish productivity, added to the market's foul mood as investors also kept watch over the situation with Iraq. 
The Labor Department reported that companies' productivity fell at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in the final quarter of 2002, the weakest showing in more than a year. Economists predicted a 0.7 percent rise. 
The department also reported that new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week by a seasonally adjusted 11,000 to 391,000. That was a turnaround from the previous week when claims rose by 19,000, suggesting the pace of layoffs may be stabilizing though employment remained sluggish. 
Analysts say investors remain hesitant to commit themselves to stocks because of concerns about a war with Iraq; that reluctance has fed steep declines in the last three weeks. But they add that the market could see some short-term rallies based mostly on bargain hunting and generally positive earnings news. 
Yesterday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the uncertainty over Iraq would be brought to a conclusion "within weeks." 
A. C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates, said, "it's only the uncertainties of the Iraqi confrontation that are currently bedeviling the markets," said citing recent data showing improvements in profits, as well as the manufacturing and service sectors. 
"Should that be a short-term affair and successful business," Mr. Moore said, "there could be a very strong lift to stocks from current levels." 
Shares in Agilent Technologies slid $4.06, or 24.9 percent, to $12.26 after warning that losses in its latest fiscal quarter would be greater than its previous forecast and Wall Street's estimates. 
Shares in PepsiCo, the soft drink maker, fell 86 cents, to $40.22, after it reported fourth-quarter income that met analysts' expectations. 
Allstate dropped $2.37, to $32.02, despite reporting fourth-quarter operating income that topped expectations by 10 cents a share. 
Other gainers included Gap, the owner of the Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains, which rose 55 cents, to $15.53, after it posted January sales that were above expectations; it also raised its earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2003. 
In the bond market yesterday, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 14/32 , to 100 15/32 , and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.95 percent, from 3.99 percent on Wednesday. 
The 30-year bond climbed 24/32 , to 108 21/32 . Its yield fell to 4.81 percent, from 4.86 percent.

HEADLINE: Productivity Fell in Quarter But Rose Sharply in 2002 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Companies stopped becoming more efficient in the final three months of last year as a slowing economy caught many by surprise, according to government figures released yesterday. The productivity gain for all of 2002 was still the best in more than 50 years, however.
 The report helped send stocks lower as investors worried that corporate America's profit slump would continue, analysts said. 
 The productivity decline suggested that the exceptionally rapid gains of the last two years would probably not be sustained, confirming the predictions of some economists. But most emphasized that the report probably overstated the slowdown and that companies found themselves temporarily unable to keep costs from rising more quicklythan revenue when the economy weakened late last year. 
"In the fourth quarter, demand just dried up," said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at the Wachovia Corporation. "Businesses were unable to immediately react."
Productivity -- the amount that the average worker produces in one hour -- fell at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in the nonfarm business sector during the final three months of 2002, the first decline since early 2001. It grew 4.7 percent over the year, according to the Labor Department, as companies cut workers while increasing output.
A numerical blip may also have played a role in the fourth-quarter decline, analysts said. The Labor Department report showed a rapid rise in the number of hours worked by the self-employed, even as the economy was slowing. Many economists predicted that the government would eventually revise the data, lowering the number of hours worked and thus raising productivity.
"The one-quarter swing is partly a statistical artifact," said Richard B. Berner, the chief domestic economist at Morgan Stanley. "The surprising thing to me is still that productivity has been as strong as it has been."
New technologies and business strategies will probably help productivity grow more quickly in coming years than it did from the mid-1970's to the mid-90's, when it increased about 1.4 percent a year, analysts say. That slowdown caused great concern among economists and policy makers and was seen as a chief reason that wages stagnated. 
But productivity growth accelerated to slightly more than 2 percent a year in the late 1990's, allowing both corporate profits and wages to rise as companies were able to produce goods more efficiently. 
Economists credit improved technology, increased spending on it by businesses and new management techniques intended to compete in an increasingly globalized and deregulated economy.
"When it all comes out, we will have considerably slower growth of productivity than we did in the late 90's," said Dale W. Jorgenson, a Harvard economist. "But I'm still very sanguine."
Productivity gains improve a society's standard of living by allowing it to choose between more goods and more leisure, although the benefits can flow unevenly across the population. During the last two years, the ability of companies to increase output while cutting jobs has helped create the worst employment decline in almost 20 years.
Even the Federal Reserve is trying to become efficient, announcing yesterday the layoff of 400 workers.
The Labor Department also reported yesterday that the number of people filing for jobless benefits was little changed last week. A surge in layoffs during late 2002 seems to be ebbing, but few companies are adding to their payrolls.
First-time claims for unemployment insurance fell to 391,000, from 402,000 the previous week. The number of people receiving jobless benefits rose to 3.35 million from 3.3 million. 
Average labor costs, including salary and benefits, increased at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter, according to the productivity report, but many analysts said they expected that number to be revised as well. For the full year, labor costs fell 1.7 percent, the biggest decline on record, according to Salomon Smith Barney.
The Labor Department will release its monthly jobs report for January this morning. Economists expect that employment will have grown by about 60,000 to 80,000 jobs, after having fallen by more than two million since March 2001, and that the unemployment rate will remain at about 6 percent.

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: THE BUILDERS; 
At NASA Assembly Plant, Workers Fear the Loss of a Shuttle Will Also Mean the Loss of Jobs

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
On the front lawn of the NASA plant on this city's eastern edge lies a 133-foot-long Saturn V rocket booster, minted from the same production line that put Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon.
 Not far away are the seven rhododendrons planted for the crew of the space shuttle Challenger, and the wilting flowers and balloons and handwritten notes stuck into the chain-link fence in memory of the Columbia astronauts. 
 In good times and bad for more than 40 years, this plant, the Michoud Assembly Facility, has been tied to the country's space program.
Public scrutiny of the factory has waned since NASA officials backed away Wednesday from the theory that insulation foam from the external fuel tanks produced here could have caused the Columbia's destruction on Saturday. But that came as bittersweet news, because NASA is still coping with a mystery, and the longer the investigation into loss of the Columbia, the greater the uncertainty over jobs and paychecks at Michoud. 
Though the plant is owned by NASA, it is the Lockheed Martin Corporation that operates it and employs its 2,000 workers.
"I called my supervisors and found out they had reassigned people," said Vickie Schmersahl, who has been a maintenance worker at the plant for 19 years but is home on medical leave. "They're going to try real hard not to lay people off. But I found out the plant is extremely somber, extremely quiet."
Despite the inquiry's change of direction, NASA officials continued looking into production here today, roaming through parts of the plant used for mixing polyurethane foam insulation and spraying it onto the exterior of the external tanks. Those areas are shut down now; the 200 people who worked in them have been sent for training, temporarily reassigned or asked to take vacation.
"Certainly the length of the investigation will have an impact on what happens here," said Marion LaNasa, a company spokesman. "The best scenario will be a very rapid solution to the problem, one that will ensure we will fly again soon, but that sounds a bit optimistic."
Mr. LaNasa said that aside from halting insulation production, NASA had not asked the company to stop or slow work on the 154-foot tanks. But, he added, it has offered no reassurances for the future.
The plant's sole purpose is to produce the $43 million external tanks. They are assembled here in a 20-story building, then shipped by barge to the shuttle launching pad at Cape Canaveral, Fla. Each shuttle flight requires a new tank, and 15 tanks are in various stages of production.
The factory sprawls across an 843-acre property that in antebellum days was the site of a French sugar refinery. It is just down the road from a Folger's Coffee plant and 20 minutes northeast of the French Quarter.
Lockheed Martin's presence here makes it the fourth-largest manufacturing employer in the state, said Loren Scott, a professor emeritus of economics at Louisiana State University. But the number of jobs was once much higher, before layoffs resulting from cost-cutting and production slowdowns in recent years.
Two years ago, NASA asked Lockheed Martin to deliver six external tanks a year, rather than eight. As a result, 15 percent of the work force was cut last year.
That could be mild compared with what might happen if NASA again halted shuttle launchings, which it did for nearly three years after the Challenger disaster in 1986.
The Challenger blew up above Florida in January of that year, and by December Lockheed Martin had pared 1,000 people from a work force of 4,800.
Because the work is specialized and pays relatively well, Professor Loren said, any layoffs have a heavy effect on the local economy. Stores, restaurants and other businesses rely on the workers' paychecks, and he estimated that for every job lost at the plant, two more people would lose their jobs at local businesses.
Some people might find jobs at a nearby Northrop Grumman shipyard that last July won a lucrative Coast Guard contract, Professor Loren said. But the country is also undergoing its worst hiring slump in nearly 20 years.
In Slidell, a nearby city where many plant workers live, Bob Smith, who owns Slidell Hardware, wrung his hands over the future. "The Challenger hurt us badly, but this may be worse," Mr. Smith said. "Everything is already so darn slow."
The uncertainty at Michoud also raises questions about $4 million in federal money that Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, has been trying to win for the plant. Ms. Landrieu put the money into an omnibus spending bill passed by the Senate last month. The bill's final version is now being hammered out by a committee of Senate and House members.
An advocacy group, Taxpayers for Common Sense, has attacked the proposed financing because it is earmarked for a site run by a specific company, said Keith Ashdown, the group's vice president for policy.
But for the anxious workers here, that kind of political wrangling seems almost beside the point. 
"I feel very stressed about this whole situation," said Elaine Nita, a 43-year-old receptionist at the plant. "None of us know anything about our jobs. It's just natural to be worried about our livelihood."

HEADLINE: F.B.I. Recruits Chinese Students in U.S. 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is recruiting Chinese students at American universities to gain insight into what it says is an intensified effort by the Chinese government to obtain militarily useful technologies in the United States, according to law enforcement officials.
 A senior F.B.I. official said the program was aimed at students and scholars because they were sometimes tapped by the Chinese government to collect information, particularly in nuclear physics and disciplines that could be used to advance military communications, missile tracking and battlefield command and control. 
 The effort, which the official said had been going on for six months and entailed paying students from China, comes as the F.B.I. seeks to revitalize its battered reputation as a counterintelligence unit in the aftermath of terrorist attacks. 
It reflects the complex, evolving economic relationship between China and the United States, particularly in the area of technology. 
China consumes billions of dollars a year in American technology products, and Chinese scholars and entrepreneurs increasingly are the business partners of Americans, making it a serious challenge to discern which technology transfers are legitimate and which constitute a national security threat.
Policy experts say the Chinese government wants to acquire more advanced military technology, particularly in communications.
One F.B.I. official involved with the recruiting of students said there were students acting as agents for the Chinese government -- or who might be tapped to do so -- who could lend insight into the specific technologies being sought. 
He said students were being paid for providing information, but would not say how much.
"We're not interested in kids taking history or English 101," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "We want lists of students in the nuclear physics program."
The official said the F.B.I. was trying to identify people with access to the directives of the Chinese government who "can tell us where they're focusing their efforts." 
He added that the F.B.I. field offices were also looking for people who "if they go home, or when they go home, would be in a position to assist us."
A second F.B.I. official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bureau was making the effort in part because the government was seeing "a more focused, more directed and more prioritized collection effort" to obtain American technology. He said the Chinese were seeking nuclear weapons technology, and advanced military technology to be used for missile systems and electronic warfare.
In a statement responding to questions, the Chinese government said the idea that it was "collecting military, scientific and technological intelligence in the U.S. is sheer fabrication and not worthy of comment."
The two senior F.B.I. officials said most of the tens of thousands of Chinese students and thousands of scholars visiting the United States for conferences and exchanges were not involved in any organized effort to procure technology. 
Further, the officials said much of the technology sought by the Chinese government was not necessarily proprietary, but public information of the type that could easily be found at a university library.
There is nothing new to the assertion that Beijing is directing an effort to obtain advanced technology. Some China scholars are skeptical that the effort has intensified, as the F.B.I. contends.
James Mulvenon, a China scholar with the Rand Corporation, said there was no evidence that the Chinese were involved in some new "vacuum cleaner campaign of technology." Still, he and several other scholars said there was value in government efforts to develop intelligence through Chinese students.
"We need to know more about the linkages between the Chinese military, Chinese government and Chinese industry," Mr. Mulvenon said. One way to go about it, he said, "is to actually talk to the people most strongly wooed by this apparatus -- by the Chinese industry, government and military."
Mr. Mulvenon said his research indicated that for the 2001-02 school year, 63,211 Chinese students were in American degree programs. They represent 11 percent of all foreign students in the United States. 
One challenge for the F.B.I., China scholars said, is finding students who already work for the Chinese government, or may do so, to act as sources of information.
"There's a massive Chinese presence in this country," said Nicholas Lardy, a scholar at the Brookings Institution. "To separate those who are here legitimately from those with a government mandate to get a hold of proprietary technology is very difficult."
Richard Bush, also a Brookings Institution scholar, said that he was not familiar with the F.B.I. program, but that the bureau "has not a very good reputation" in terms of counterintelligence, "so one would have to be cautious that this approach is going to be effective." 
He added that the F.B.I. would have to worry about Chinese students "being turned" by the Chinese government and the F.B.I. then "being fed bad information."
A scholar who has discussed the program with the F.B.I., speaking on condition of anonymity, said that in the last year "there has been a very strongly renewed effort" by the F.B.I. to monitor and recruit Chinese students. He said it was "part and parcel of the effort" by the F.B.I. and the Immigration and Naturalization Service "to track all foreign students." 
But he said that in the case of the Chinese, the F.B.I. was approaching students in nuclear physics, aerodynamics, engineering related to missiles or space satellites, nanotechnology, and disciplines related to supercomputers and encryption.
He said the F.B.I., in an effort to establish ties with students, had organized meetings with Chinese student groups on some campuses, seeking to recruit translators.
The F.B.I. official involved in recruiting students said those being sought may or may not already be working for the Chinese government or military. 
The official said the Chinese military might seek to recruit a student to send over scientific information, sometimes seemingly very basic. The Chinese government will tell the student, "get on the university system and e-mail us everything about widgets," the official said. "It's open-source information," he said, but the student "has still done something."
Henry Tang, the co-chairman of the Committee of 100, a Chinese-American institute in Washington, said that whether to cooperate with the F.B.I. "is the decision of the individual student." 
But Mr. Tang, who said he was not familiar with the recruiting program, said he worried about a policy and statements from the F.B.I. that could unfairly cast aspersions on tens of thousands of Chinese students, and Chinese-Americans more generally.

HEADLINE: AMF, Bowling Giant, Is Said to Seek Buyer 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
Bowling for dollars, anyone?
 AMF Bowling Worldwide, the world's largest bowling company, is planning to put itself up for sale, executives close to the company said yesterday. AMF has hired Greenhill & Company to approach possible buyers, the executives said, and it hopes to raise as much as $700 million in cash and the assumption of debt. 
 The sale would represent a new chapter in the tumultuous life of AMF, which was founded as American Machine and Foundry. At one time or another in its century-long history, it has made Harley-Davidson motorcycles, Ben Hogan golf clubs and Hatteras yachts. 
Last March, AMF, based in Richmond, Va., emerged from bankruptcy protection after a disastrous series of bowling-alley acquisitions when the business was owned by the investment bank Goldman, Sachs.
AMF's current owners -- mostly vulture investors that bought the company's debt for cents on the dollar and are hardly considered natural long-term investors in the business -- are now looking to profit. The company's board is expected to decide whether to proceed with the sale plan in the next several weeks, the executives said.
AMF's four largest investors -- Farallon Capital; Angelo, Gordon & Company; Satellite Asset Management; and Oaktree Capital Management -- are pushing for the sale, the executives said.
The company is without a permanent leader. In December, its chief executive, Roland Smith, resigned to become chief executive of the American Golf Corporation and National Golf Properties. George W. Vieth Jr., an AMF board member, was appointed interim chief executive.
Merrell Wreden, a spokesman for AMF, did not return calls seeking comment yesterday.
The sale suggests a pattern that could emerge over the next several years as investors that speculated in the debt of bankrupt companies seek to unwind their positions. 
It remains unclear how attractive AMF will prove to be to buyers. Under Goldman, Sachs, AMF went on a spending spree, buying bowling centers nationwide in an effort to create a true national chain. It is about double the size of its closest rival, Brunswick.
But some analysts question whether the strategy is still practical. "The jury is out on whether a national bowling chain is viable," said Sandy Hansell, a consultant and broker for the bowling industry in Southfield, Mich. "The markets vary too much to be standardized. You have different people looking for different recreation in each region."
And the bowling craze of the mid-1990's -- with "extreme bowling" nights complete with disco music and black lights -- may or may not be returning.
Goldman, Sachs learned that the hard way. Goldman bought AMF in 1996 for $380 million and $1 billion of debt with a plan to take the company public to finance a rapid expansion in the United States and China. AMF would make money two ways: by operating a chain of bowling centers and by selling the equipment to outfit new ones.
But while AMF was buying alleys and trying to run them more efficiently, league bowling, the lifeblood of the bowling business, was dying. And in the summer of 1998, the Asian economic crisis spread and deepened, wiping out demand for capital-intensive leisure activities like bowling. AMF lost $125 million in 1998, widening to $200 million by the time the debt-burdened company filed for Chapter 11 protection in July 2001. 
While business has returned and AMF has reduced its debt to $450 million from $1.2 billion, it is hardly the growth business investors expected it to be. It remains unclear who will emerge to buy AMF, which has 385 bowling centers in the United States and more than 100 abroad. Analysts said the most likely buyers would be leveraged-buyout firms and so-called location-based entertainment companies that run theme park chains. Because AMF has cash flow of about $125 million a year, analysts expect that buyout firms could afford to spend $600 million to $700 million and still make a tidy profit.
Some analysts say that a buyer could try to break up the business, splitting the chain of bowling centers and its equipment-making arm. AMF manufactures equipment like automatic pinspotters, scoring equipment, bowling-center furniture, bowling pins, special lanes, ball returns and spare parts. It also sells products like bowling balls, bags and shoes.
Indeed, the automatic pinspotter -- developed by an inventor named Fred Schmidt, who was hired by AMF in 1938 to perfect it -- revolutionized the bowling industry when it was introduced at the ABC National Championship in Buffalo in 1946 and it made AMF a leader in the industry.
A buyer could also try to split up the bowling-alley chain, Mr. Hansell said, and sell groups of bowling centers piecemeal to regional competitors.

HEADLINE: LOSS OF THE SHUTTLE: THE NEXT CREW; 
A Shuttle Leader Is Ready 'to Go Fly Again'

BYLINE:  By JIM YARDLEY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
A veteran of three space shuttle missions, Eileen Collins carried her 2-year-old son downstairs on Saturday morning, expecting a routine landing of the Columbia when she flipped on NASA's television channel. She listened as Mission Control lost contact and watched in agony as the shuttle vanished from the radar system and into oblivion.
 She found some toys for her son and hurriedly began making telephone calls. She was grateful the boy was too young to realize what had happened. "He was going, 'shuttle, shuttle,' " she said. 
 Hours later, she rushed to the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, desperate to help learn what destroyed the Columbia. A former chief of the Astronaut Safety Branch and an Air Force colonel, she volunteered for the team that was forming to investigate the accident. But her offer was politely refused because she has another job that will require all of her energy and attentions. 
Colonel Collins is next in space.
"My job now is to make sure my crew is ready to fly," she said.
Barring an unforeseen change, Colonel Collins, 46, will be the commander of the next shuttle mission, on board the Atlantis.
The mission was scheduled for March 1 but has since been temporarily delayed.
The mission is significant not only because of planned repairs to the space station, but more importantly because the Atlantis is scheduled to deliver to the station a new team of astronauts and retrieve the team currently orbiting. This week, a Russian cargo spaceship delivered to the team enough provisions to last well into summer. 
Before Saturday morning, many Americans may have lost interest in shuttle missions, but the nation will probably be closely monitoring the fate of the Atlantis. It does not seem too hyperbolic to say that the future of NASA, and the nation's continued commitment to manned space travel, depends on a successful and safe mission, should the Atlantis go forward at all.
For Colonel Collins, an affable, seemingly unflappable woman, the mission is only her latest role in space history. In 1995, she became first woman to pilot a shuttle. Then in July 1999, she became the first woman to be a shuttle commander. On that trip, she rode the Columbia and was credited with coolly handling a series of technical malfunctions that arose.
Asked if she felt even a twinge of fear after the loss of the Columbia, Colonel Collins, whom NASA made available for a 15-minute interview this afternoon, leaned forward in her bright blue NASA jumpsuit, unblinking, and thought for just a moment.
"I would have to say no," she said. "I want to go fly again. I am very mentally ready to go fly again." 
Then, pausing, noting that she wanted to be precise, she added, "I am mentally ready to go fly again when the shuttle is cleared to fly."
NASA officials have yet to announce a new schedule for the Atlantis, but Colonel Collins said she believed the likelihood of a March launch was practically nil. She said the timing would depend on the investigation and how long it takes to find out what problem left Columbia doomed. She said the delay may stretch past this summer, into fall or even winter.
No one has told her when the mission will be rescheduled. She says she knows only that she wants to lead it.
"I want to support the needs of the space program," she said. "If my crew stays, if my missions stays in the current sequence, then I am just thrilled to be onboard the next shuttle mission."
The fact that Colonel Collins finds herself thrust into such a role brings satisfaction, and validation, for those women who remember how slowly NASA once warmed to the notion of women in space. Of the nation's 160 former astronauts, 10 were women. The numbers have risen among the active astronaut corps, with 23 women out of 115 active astronauts.
"I think its fantastic what she's doing," said Bernice Steadman, a former president of the International Women's Air and Space Museum in Cleveland, who once aspired to be an astronaut. "She is such a role model. She's not flamboyant. She's down to earth and easy to talk with. I have nothing but the highest regard for her."
Colonel Collins's sex will probably heighten the attention surrounding the Atlantis mission. "I think it's important for women, women in the space program," Colonel Collins said. "I think it's important that young women see they have role models and see they can be astronauts. It took me awhile to learn that."
As commander, Colonel Collins oversees a crew of three other astronauts, all men. This does not include the three astronauts the Atlantis will deliver to the space station. The Atlantis crew, known as STS-114, began training at the Johnson Space Center in February 2002. After the fatal explosion of the Challenger in 1986, NASA rearranged its shuttle schedule. Colonel Collins, though, believes her crew will be next in space because it is trained to make critical repairs to the space station and to deliver important spare parts.
For the past week, Colonel Collins has suspended training. Two of her crew members are among the astronauts assigned to support the grieving Columbia families. 
Colonel Collins, who knew all seven of the astronauts aboard the Columbia, said that next week she and the fourth crew member would resume maintenance training while their two peers would continue to help the families. Asked about the renewed debate over the necessity and wisdom of continuing manned space flight, Colonel Collins flushed slightly, saying she did not want to say something heated that she might regret.
"I believe in human exploration," she said. "I believe we need to go into earth's orbit. We need to go back to the moon and build a space station. We need to go to Mars and build a space station."
She even envisioned a distant future in which space travel might be necessary for the continued existence of the human race, should resources be diminished on earth.
Colonel Collins, a native of Elmira, N.Y., earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics and economics from Syracuse University. She earned graduate degrees from Stanford University and from Webster University. She was an Air Force pilot and instructor as well as an assistant professor at the Air Force Academy.
NASA selected her for the astronaut program in January 1990.
Her experience with NASA is broad, as she has held a variety of administrative posts in the astronaut office and the shuttle program. In all, she has logged over 537 hours in space in three shuttle missions. Asked why she left the Air Force for NASA, Colonel Collins said: "I love to fly. I believe in the mission of the space program."
As yet, Colonel Collins said she had not held a meeting of her Atlantis crew since the Columbia disaster. She also knows she needs to have a long talk with her 7-year-old daughter. 
Colonel Collins said she pulled her daughter aside in December, realizing that she was old enough to understand the risks of her mother's mission and that she might hear things at school that would alarm her.
She said she told her daughter about the Challenger explosion and that she wanted her to understand that the shuttle had been fixed. Now, though, she realizes that the shuttle again needs fixing. She said she trusts NASA to eventually find the problem and to make the shuttles safe for space. 
And that, she said, is what she plans to tell her daughter.
"I'll tell her I wouldn't fly if it's unsafe," she said. "I know it's going to be safe to fly."

HEADLINE: Immigration to Israel Reaches 13-Year Low 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Feb. 6 

 BODY:
Immigration to Israel in 2002 was the lowest in 13 years, the Central Bureau of Statistics said today.
 Immigration officials explaining the drop said the potential pool of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union is dwindling, although security concerns also appear to be keeping some people from settling in Israel. 
 Scores of immigrants have been among the hundreds of Israelis killed in the last 28 months of Israeli-Palestinian fighting.
The statistics bureau said 33,000 people immigrated to Israel in 2002, or about 10,000 fewer than in 2001.
In the past decade, the vast majority of newcomers to Israel were Jews from the former Soviet republics. That was also true in 2002, but the influx decreased from the previous year. At the same time, migration from Argentina tripled, fueled by the severe economic troubles.
The number of French Jews arriving in Israel doubled from the year before, and migration from the United States increased by 23 percent.
