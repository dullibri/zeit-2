A New Bank Hopes to Grow In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Not many financial institutions in the nation can boast of making fewer bad loans than the tiny Community Capital Bank of Brooklyn.
"At this point, we are among the most liquid and safe banks in New York," said Lyndon Comstock, its 40-year-old chairman. 
 Mr. Comstock was being facetious. Actually, the bank hasn't made any bad loans, in large part because it hasn't made any loans at all yet. It formally opens tomorrow.
That this might seem like an inopportune time for most entrepreneurs to establish a bank is beside the point: Mr. Comstock first envisioned it 12 years ago; since then, the demand for his type of lending institution has, if anything, increased.
"We are the first bank in New York City to adopt as its main purpose to do community lending on a safe and profitable basis," Mr. Comstock said. "From the point of view of need, it's certainly as great as ever in terms of housing development and of financing small business."
Enlightened self-interest, coupled with legislative prodding for lenders to address the credit needs of their local communities, has led some urban banks to put their depositors' money where their mouths are. But several others have all but abandoned poor neighborhoods -- closing branches or diverting deposits to invest in out-of-town or overseas ventures hat may be even more risky but also are potentially more profitable. The city's Department of Consumer Affairs recently accused some banks of increasing their customer fees, in part to compensate for loan losses.
Also, some institutions that began as neighborhood banks pursued more generic marketing strategies or, at least, less distinct identities as they grew. (In the last decade, the Brooklyn Savings Bank merged with Metropolitan Savings, which became Crossland -- a multistate bank, still based in Brooklyn.)
In addition, money for community development has become tighter because of the recession (the previous tenant at Community Capital's office at 111 Livingston Street in downtown Brooklyn was a brokerage firm) and because of failures and imprudent lending practices by banks and savings and loan associations across the country.
Mr. Comstock, who comes from a Midwest banking family, was first struck by the need for a lender like Community Capital when, while studying for a master's degree in business administration at the University of California at Berkeley, he helped organize affordable-housing cooperatives. His inspiration was the South Shore Bank of Chicago, which helped engineer a neighborhood revival. Mr. Comstock worked at more traditional banks before he began to organize Community Capital full time five years ago this month.
Community Capital Bank is small, so far, with $7 million in assets. Nearly all of that was raised from 248 shareholders. About two-thirds of the bank's $6 million in stock was sold to institutions -- with about half of this from corporations, labor unions and nonprofit organizations, and the rest from religious groups.
Among the biggest shareholders are the Educational and Cultural Fund of the Electrical Industry, the Metropolitan Life Foundation and Ecumenical Development Cooperative Society. Others include J. P. Morgan & Company, the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, the American Express Company, the Brooklyn Union Gas Company and Time Warner.
"We don't have the resources, experience and skills needed to extend credit to small businesses and to make home mortgage loans in New York," said Michael E. Patterson, executive vice president of J. P. Morgan, whose clients are far-flung and which bought $250,000 of the bank's stock. "For us, it is a way to participate importantly, though indirectly, in financing community development."
Community Capital was chartered as a business, not as a charity. It plans to offer consumers competitive interest rates on deposits, which are federally insured up to $100,000, and on other services. Similarly, it will charge market rates on loans and be guided by what Mr. Comstock regards as "Rule No. 1 of lending: know your borrower."
What distinguishes Community Capital, though, is its willingness -- indeed, its very mission -- to lend money for affordable housing and for business development in New York City's low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Consequently, the bank hopes to attract deposits from like-minded institutions and individuals in the region and beyond.
Given the composition and the commitment of the bank's shareholders and directors, Mr. Comstock said, its social agenda is likely to endure. "I can't imagine our board approving a shift into financing oil rigs," he said.

HEADLINE: Morris County Sees Taxes Rise As Values Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MORRISTOWN, N.J., Jan. 4

 BODY:
After a 10-year boom in construction and property values, the taxable worth of real estate is dropping in Morris County, all but guaranteeing higher property taxes for homeowners.
After soaring alongside the economy in the 1980's, Morris County's ratables -- the taxable value of its land and buildings and the foundation of its local budgets -- have declined by $2 billion to about $42 billion for the 1991 tax year, officials said. 
 Successful challenges to assessments on commercial properties, including offices, apartments, hotels and a golf course, have added millions of dollars to the decline and shifted a higher proportion of the county's property tax bill to homeowners, already angry about all taxes in the county.
 
Stormy Future for Local Budgets
 Worried elected officials, in turn, have countered with the county's biggest recent number of layoffs in hopes of minimizing the tax increase as they draft the county's estimated $151 million budget for 1991.
If the decline in the tax base deepens in coming months -- and sagging home prices and a soaring number of challenges to property assessments suggest it will -- officials fear stormy years ahead for county, school and municipal budgets, with rising taxes on homeowners and steadily shrinking school, local and county services.
Officials here also believe that Gov. Jim Florio's promise of property-tax relief is doomed this year by the declining tax base.
Morris's $2 billion drop has startled county officials.
"The 80's had them escalating so high that reality has set in," Robert Natoli, the county treasurer, said of property values.
Bud Struble, head of the County Board of Taxation, said, "For the first time in memory, we're going the other way -- real value is coming down." Real, or market, value is a critical part of assessed value.
Fretful about voter animosity over property taxes, Morris's governing body, the Board of Freeholders, has already laid off 34 county workers, the biggest single dismissal they can remember; left 20 vacant jobs unfilled, and used up all but $270,000 of a $2 million surplus in the 1990 budget to keep county spending and taxes down.
 
Paying More for Lost Value
 But unless other cuts are made -- and officials call it unlikely -- the county's property taxes will go up. The chief cause is lost value in the tax base.
At this point, the county's new estimated property tax rate is 27.3 cents for each $100 of assessed value, up 1.8 cents over 1990's rate. Of that total, 1.1 cents stems from the lower tax base. Higher government costs account for the other seven-tenths of a cent.
Eliminating that seven-tenths of a cent from the increase would mean $3 million more in cuts, said Thomas Markt, Morris's Director of Budget Operations.
"I don't think there's any way we can reduce it," Mr. Markt said.
Eliminating the 1.1 cent rise caused by the tax-base loss would require a $5.5 million budget cut. "There's no way for us to offset that," he said.
 
7.1 Percent Estimated Rise
 On a home assessed at $200,000, the total proposed county-tax increase would be $36, to $546, a 7.1-percent rise. Of the increase, the tax base accounts for $22 and increased expenses, $14.
The county-tax rate is one of the three elements in a typical property tax bill, and usually the smallest. The tax base is also used for school and municipal budgets, which account for 75 to 80 percent of each property-tax bill. Assessed values are growing in some of Morris's 39 towns and declining in others. Officials expect an impact on some municipal and school budgets, but the degree is unclear.
Mr. Struble, head of Morris's tax board, said three factors had combined to cut the tax base: sagging sales and prices of private homes; sharp reductions in assessments on commercial and industrial properties in Morris County by the New Jersey Tax Court, and a plunge in new construction.
 
Anger and Appeals Rise
 The slumping real-estate market has cut deeply into Morris's revenues from the state's real-estate transfer tax on all property sales. After peaking at $5.3 million in 1986, this tax revenue fell to and $3.6 million in 1990.
Taxpayer anger over property assessments is rising sharply, both in Morris and the rest of New Jersey.
Morris's tax board received 3,140 challenges to home assessments in 1990, triple the annual rate in the 1980's, Mr. Struble, of the tax board, said. "We lowered very few assessments," he said. "This board is pretty tight with money."
The picture is the same at the state's Tax Court, which hears appeals of commercial assessments of more than $750,000.
Between last July 1 and Dec. 31, the court received 4,500 new challenges to assessments statewide, up 40 percent over the same six-month period in 1989, the court's clerk, Wesley LaBar, said.
 
Less Income, LowerTaxes
 "This was the highest rate of filings we've ever had," Mr. LaBar said.
Since 1987, the number of commercial-assessment challenges statewide has grown by 250 percent, he said. Unlike residential appeals, which are based on comparing assessments of similar homes, commercial challenges can be brought if rental or other income from the property has fallen.
In his office here, Mr. Struble is still sifting through scores of recently lowered commercial assessments and calculating the tax credits due owners.
State officials say that Governor Florio's promise of property-tax relief will be met, mainly because the state has assumed county costs for welfare and mental hospitals and imposed a toughened ceiling on municipal spending and county tax increases.
"I expect county tax rates to drop," said Barry Skokowski, director of the state's Division of Local Government Services, which oversees county and municipal budgets.
Morris officials say the state's changes are included in the new budget and property taxes will still go up.
"In another four or five months, we'll see if all his talk about property-tax relief will be a reality," Mr. Struble said of Governor Florio. "We're going to know soon and I think you're going to see some more marching."

Remarks by Hussein to Troops on Kuwait

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a televised speech by President Saddam Hussein today as translated by The Associated Press from a transcript distributed by the Iraqi News Agency:
 Every year, on the 6th of January, we celebrate Army Day, the anniversary of the army of the nation in the great Iraq. We also reflect on the past, look at our present and project into the future . . . and the pride, sovereignty, liberation and victory that satisfies God that is awaiting us in a world whose lands are infested with scorpions, snakes, hypocrisy and oppression, and its oceans and seas filled with . . . sharks waiting for their prey. . . . This day has become a blessed occasion for Arabs in this phase as it has become a synonym of a glory illuminating the struggle of our kinfolk, the heroes of the stone in dear Palestine.
What a great pride it is, dear comrades in arms, that we belong to a march crowned with glory and satisfying God. . . . In this struggle that you are leading, you are fighting against social and economic oppression, against discrimination . . . , against the oppression pacticed by foreign powers . . . , against double standards, corruption and hegemony.
For these reasons, the battle in which you are locked today is the mother of all battles.
Let no one be deceived. The battle against the tyranny represented by the United States and the slogans of hegemony it is raising on the international and regional level and against the forces of infidelity so they be ousted from our holy lands is not expected to be a short one.
In one battle you had prepared a historical opportunity for which our forefathers had longed and died without witnessing it. That was the return of Kuwait to its Iraqi motherland -- a reality, not a wish or a claim, that made it the 19th province of the treasured political map of Iraq for the present and future times.
It is indeed a source of great pride to accomplish more than one goal in a single showdown. Together with the heroes of stones you have transformed the possibility of ousting the invaders into a tangible and visible reality. Our rendezvous with victory is very near, God willing.
Praise be to God, we are fortunate that this army has . . . grown to accomplish all its goals and take on the enemy within the borders of the homeland with all that has been placed at its disposal by the sons of this homeland. . . . A battle of such scope requires great sacrifices both in qualtity and quantity irrespective of the foreseen and unforeseen consequences, which will no doubt please the friend and anger the enemy.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Votes Backing Use of Force Are Predicted in Congress

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
The likelihood of formal Congressional support for an attack on Iraq increased sharply yesterday when the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, said the House would vote on the issue this week and would probably "narrowly" support a decision by President Bush to use force.
Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, said he thought the Senate would also support a resolution authorizing the use of force after Jan. 15 if the question could be brought to a vote and was not thwarted by a filibuster. 
 The Administration, which had previously treated anything less than overwhelming Congressional votes as likely to send a message of weakness to Iraq, shifted its stance and welcomed the prospect of action on Capitol Hill.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, appearing later on the same television interview program as Mr. Foley and Mr. Dole, the ABC News feature "This Week," said a vote by the 60-40 margin Mr. Dole predicted would be "helpful" to the Administration.
 
No Meeting With Hussein
 Mr. Baker, who left yesterday for Europe and a meeting on Wednesday in Geneva with Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Foreign Minister, reiterated the Administration's insistence that he would not go on to Baghdad to meet President Saddam Hussein. He said any such meeting would allow Iraq to "manipulate the deadline" set by the United Nations.
Congressional leaders in both houses now expect to begin debate on the issue on Thursday, the day after the Geneva meeting, and to vote before the Jan. 15 deadline approved by the United Nations Security Council on Nov. 29. The United Nations resolution authorized members "to use all necessary means" to expel Iraq from Kuwait if it had not withdrawn by the 15th.
The House is expected to vote on Friday -- not merely on a proposal comparable to the United Nations action but on one or more contrary resolutions, like a call for continued reliance on economic sanctions, a policy Mr. Foley said he personally favored for the time being.
The shape of those alternatives is still to be worked out among House leaders, supporters of various positions and the Foreign Affairs Committee, which was formally constituted on Thursday, earlier than most committees, so it could deal with this issue. As recently as Friday, House leaders had not expected to act this quickly, but pressure from foes of using force, in both Houses but especially in the Senate, has advanced the timetable.
 
Amendments May Be Sought
 In the Senate a vote will probably come later than Friday, but Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said he expected the Senate could dispose of the issue "prior to the 15th." Mr. Mitchell also said that he himself opposed "a U.N. type resolution," allowing the use of force at some unspecified time.
Mr. Mitchell, interviewed on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," did not offer any estimate on how votes in the Senate would go, or say just which proposals would be voted on. He said that "the rules permit unlimited amendments, so I expect you'll see any number of resolutions offered as amendments."
Mr. Dole called on President Bush to ask Congress to approve a resolution comparable to the United Nations declaration. He said, "In my view, if we could ever get it to a vote in the Senate -- because there we have unlimited debate, you'd have to shut off debate, that takes 60 votes -- but if we could get it to a vote, I think it would pass with a bipartisan majority." Later Mr. Dole offered a "ballpark estimate" that 60 senators would support such a resolution, and 40 would oppose it.
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, said he believed the Senate was more closely divided than Mr. Dole believed it was. "I think it would be a close vote," he said. "I don't know which way it would go." But he said in an interview that he thought a "strong appeal to the Senate by President Bush" would probably insure passage.
 
Baker Welcomes Debate
 Secretary Baker said "the President has not wanted to ask for such a resolution unless the leadership of the Congress could assure him that such a resolution would be forthcoming, because your hand would be weakened if it were not forthcoming." But he added that Mr. Bush had not ruled out asking for a resolution and said, "We, frankly, are welcoming the fact that there will be a debate in the Congress."
He also said that in his meeting with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, he would not be negotiating, but only telling him that Iraq had two options -- to withdraw from Kuwait, or "they, in all probability, will have force used against them to eject them from Kuwait."
He said that to reinforce the point, he would be carrying a letter from President Bush to Mr. Hussein making those points emphatically. A senior Administration official who declined to be identified by name said more bluntly that the letter's purpose was to "hand over something tangible that Saddam Hussein will have to read in case Tariq Aziz doesn't have the nerve to repeat our message word for word."

Search for Piece of Past Offers Lesson for Future

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LYNDON, Vt., Jan. 3

 BODY:
Ruth McCarty and her colleagues on the Lyndon Bicentennial Commission have looked everywhere. They have looked in attics and basements, bank vaults and file cabinets. And still no time capsule.
The first, and perhaps only, mention of the elusive capsule appears in a 1891 newspaper article about festivities commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Town of Lyndon. Mrs. McCarty discovered it two years ago. 
 "Lyndon's first centennial celebration has come and gone," begins the article in the July 10, 1891, issue of The Vermont Journal, a local weekly. "And due arrangements for the observance of the second have been made by procuring an iron box in which the proceedings of the first are to be sealed and remain unopened til July 4, 1991."
No mention was made of the box in the rival Lyndonville Journal that week.
Mrs. McCarty, a Lyndon native who spent 40 years in Connecticut before returning to this northeastern corner of Vermont in 1983, set out to find the iron box.
"We've looked in the town vault," she said. "We've looked in the bank vault. We've looked in the library. Nothing."
It occurred to her that in 1891 the secretary of the Lyndon Centennial Committee, Walter Ranger, was also headmaster of the public high school. So she called the school.
"They said they had a 2-foot-by-3-foot steel box with an inch of concrete on top," she recalled. "It was in the museum at the institute. Richard Boera from the state college went up with me. We certainly had our hopes up. But when we opened it, the box was empty. People said there had been papers in it, but we can't find them."
There are many other explanations for the box's disappearance. In 1891, Isaac Sanborn, the Town Clerk, had his office in his home. After he died, the house was sold and the town records were cleaned out. Fires in 1894 and 1924 destroyed most of the buildings on Depot Street, a main thoroughfare.
And then, Mrs. McCarty acknowledged, the box may never have been buried at all. "It might have been written up for the paper before the celebration," she said. "It rained very hard that day and several events had to be canceled."
The town that would be described in those lost papers was a very different place from the Lyndon of 1991. Then as now, the town consisted of four villages: Lyndonville, Lyndon Corners, Lyndon Center and East Lyndon. In those days Lyndon was smaller (population 2,619, as against 4,923 now), though it was a thriving railroad center and better off economically than now.
The Passumpsic Railroad was the largest employer in the area. The railroad bought a large tract of land near the river and created Lyndonville as a planned community for railroad workers. There were parks and shops and all the houses had to be two stories high.
Revival meetings in the downtown park, the Grove, drew as many as 10,000 people. Most came on the four passenger trains that ran through town each day.
Times are harder now. The machine tool companies that replaced the railroad as the area's major employer are in decline.
Even so, the town is planning a big celebration this summer, beginning with fireworks and a house tour on July 4 and ending in September with a horse showing featuring the Vermont-bred Morgan horse. Iron box or no, there will also be plenty of parades and pageants.
Lyndon was once on the itinerary of the Chautauqua lecture circuit run out of Boston, and in its honor the town has scheduled three days of speeches and music in early August.
One other item is on the agenda: burial of a new time capsule.
Brian Bona, president of the Chamber of Commerce, said the committee in charge of the 1991 time capsule had not decided what to put in it, or where to put it. "It would be nice for people in the future to know who contributed what to the town," Mr. Bona said. "You tend to take things for granted, forgetting that somebody had to have made it that way."
But he is certain of one thing: "We're going to be sure the location is recorded this time. We'll leave copies in the town offices, the bank, the library. We're not going to lose it again."

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Statement on Bank of New England

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement issued this evening by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regarding its takeover of the Bank of New England Corporation's three main subsidiary banks:
The F.D.I.C. board of directors today established three new full-service banks to assume all deposits and most other liabilities and assets of Bank of New England N.A., Boston; Connecticut Bank and Trust Company N.A., Hartford, and Maine National Bank, Portland, Me. 
 The new institutions -- New Bank of New England N.A.; New Connecticut Bank and Trust Company N.A., and New Maine National Bank -- were chartered by the Comptroller of the Currency today and are owned entirely by the F.D.I.C. The action took place after the Comptroller of the Currency had closed the banks and appointed the F.D.I.C. receiver. The F.D.I.C. has agreed to provide assistance to facilitate their acquisition in the near future by qualified institutions.
 
'Business as Usual'
 "We have two active bidders and other well-qualified bidders might apply," F.D.I.C. Chairman L. William Seidman said. "We expect to announce a transaction soon. In the meantime, it's business as usual."
All offices of the three closed banks will open for business as usual on Monday, Jan. 7, 1991, as offices of the new banks. Full banking services will continue to be available to all deposit and loan customers and at the same hours of operation as in the past. As part of the F.D.I.C.'s program to maintain uninterrupted service to the closed banks' customers, depositors continue to have access to their funds by checks or automated teller machines.
The Federal Reserve System is prepared, in accordance with customary arrangements, to meet any unusual liquidity needs of the banks.
 
Deposits Transferred
 All deposits of Bank of New England N.A.; Connecticut Bank and Trust Company N.A., and Maine National Bank, including those in excess of the $100,000 insurance limit, were transferred to the new banks and thus are fully protected by these transactions. Federal funds sold to the banks, liabilities to trade creditors and employees and foreign-exchange, interest-rate swap and other qualified financial contracts will be transferred to the bridge banks.
Other nonsubordinated creditors will share "pro rata" with the F.D.I.C. in the receivership estates of the banks. The new banks did not assume any of the liabilities of the parent holding company, the Bank of New England Corporation, or its creditors.
The board decided it was necessary to protect all depositors because of financial conditions in the region. As part of the transaction, the F.D.I.C. infused $750 million of capital into the banks.
Bank of New England has total assets of approximately $13.9 billion and total deposits of approximately $9.1 billion. Connecticut Bank and Trust Company has total assets of approximately $7.1 billion and total deposits of approximately $6.8 billion. Maine National Bank has total assets of approximately $1 billion and deposits of $930 million.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Alter Student Lending To Skirt Banks

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
The Bush Administration is considering major changes in the student loan program that would increase direct lending by the Federal Government and sharply curtail the role of commercial banks, which now lend more than $12 billion a year to college students.
The proposal, part of President Bush's budget request for 1992 and fiercely opposed by the banking industry, is intended to simplify the student loan program. 
 Under the proposal, students would deal exclusively with their colleges. The Government would give colleges money to create a fund from which they would lend to students. Supporters of the plan say the Government would save at least $1 billion a year because it would no longer have to pay the "special allowance" that banks now get as an inducement to offer low-interest loans to student borrowers.
 
Simplifying Enforcement
 The savings could then be used to provide more aid to the neediest college students, in keeping with Mr. Bush's pledge to be "the education President," Administration officials said.
The Guaranteed Student Loan Program is the largest source of Federal aid to college students, and the budget proposal does not envision any major change in the program's overall spending level, $5.38 billion in the current fiscal year. A student now typically borrows from a bank, which often sells the loan to some other bank or financial institution. Repayment is guaranteed by a state agency, which is reinsured by the Federal Government. The Government pays if borrowers default.
Federal officials say it would be much easier for the Government to audit 8,000 schools than to police the current system, in which more than 10,000 lenders and 54 state guarantee agencies have at least $52 billion in loans outstanding to 12 million students.
Student loan defaults, which have been rising in recent years, cost the Government $2 billion last year. While the new proposal would not solve the problem of loan defaults, Administration officials say it could produce savings by eliminating a layer of middlemen.
Education officials say the proposed arrangement would eliminate subsidies to banks totaling more than $1 billion a year. As a financial incentive for banks to make low-interest loans to students, the Government pays lenders a special allowance so that their annual rate of return on new loans is 3.25 percentage points above the interest rate for three-month Treasury bills. The Government also pays the lenders all the interest on guaranteed loans while students are enrolled in school.
 
'Cottage Industry of Middlemen'
 Mr. Bush plans to submit his budget request to lawmakers on Feb. 4., for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The effective date for changes in the student aid program would be set by Congress. An Administration official helping prepare the budget said the proposals on higher education would "eliminate the need for the cottage industry of middlemen and intermediaries that makes the current system of guaranteed student loans so blasted complex."
The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said recently that it could not audit the financial statements of the student loan program. Assistant Comptroller General Donald H. Chapin said the program did not have adequate internal controls or accounting procedures to insure the reliability of its financial records.
The Administration proposal has been endorsed by some college officials but is opposed by banks, which have been deeply involved in the student loan program for 25 years and would lose a line of business. Bank officers say they do not want to lose any source of potential profits while many banks are experiencing financial difficulties.
John E. Dean, counsel to the Consumer Bankers Association, which represents more than 700 banks and other financial institutions, said the proposal would make the program more complex.
 "Loans will still have to be serviced," he said. "Somebody will have to make aggressive collection efforts against delinquent borrowers. If the banks don't do it, who will? The Government would have to audit and supervise those organizations."
The Bush proposal is timely for two reasons. Congress must re-examine and reauthorize all higher education programs this year because the legal mandate for student aid, last renewed in 1986, is expiring.
Second, the 1990 budget agreement significantly changed Federal accounting rules. Under the old rules, Federal loan guarantees seemed to cost the Government much less than direct Government loans because they did not show up immediately as cash outlays, as direct loans do. Only much later, when borrowers defaulted and the Government had to pay the sums owed to banks and other lenders were the costs charged to Government accounts.
Under the new rules, the complete cost of Federal loan guarantees, based on an estimate of future defaults, must be recognized in the year when the loans are made. Administration officials said the new rules would eliminate the bias that used to make loan guarantees seem cheaper to the Government. As a result, they said, Congress may be more willing to replace loan guarantees with direct loans to students.
 
Simpler for Students
 Thomas A. Butts, director of the Washington office of the University of Michigan, agreed with Administration officials that direct loans would be much simpler than guaranteed loans for students and colleges alike.
"The current procedures for obtaining, disbursing and collecting guaranteed loans are very complicated and costly, highly subsidized and bureaucratic," he said. "At present, we have a student loan program designed for lenders, not for students. The complexity of the program is one reason for defaults. Students with loans from several lenders, insured by different guarantee agencies, may not know whom to pay and may not realize they can defer repayment in certain circumstances."
Mr. Dean, the lawyer for the Consumer Bankers Association, said that under current law "banks bear some of the risk of default because they may lose insurance coverage if they do not comply with a complex set of Federal rules requiring 13 separate contacts, by mail and phone, with delinquent borrowers." The Administration proposal "would shift that some of that risk from private lenders to the Federal Government," he said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
IRAQI WARNS ARMY TO PREPARE ITSELF FOR MAJOR BATTLE

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Three days before his Foreign Minister is to meet Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in Geneva to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis, President Saddam Hussein told his armed forces today that they were prepared to go to war to keep Kuwait a part of Iraq.
"You are now prepared for one historic battle after the return of the branch Kuwait to the root," Mr. Hussein said over the state-run television and radio. "The return of Kuwait is a fact and not a claim. It is the 19th province on the maps of Iraq, with its long history in the present and future." 
 Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and the emirate's fate is the central issue that Mr. Baker will bring up with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in Geneva on Wednesday. President Bush and Mr. Baker have insisted that Mr. Baker will warn Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadline imposed by the United Nations Security Council or face eviction by American-led military forces in the Persian Gulf.
 
American 'Tyranny'
 In his speech today, commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Iraqi Army, Mr. Hussein said he was preparing the nation for a great battle to liberate Palestine and defeat American "tyranny" in the Middle East.
[Such efforts to tie the gulf crisis to the Palestinian question were flatly rejected again today by Washington. Mr. Baker, arriving in London, said he could not support a French proposal because it linked Iraq's pullout from Kuwait to a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Mr. Baker also for the first time left open the possibility of meeting the Iraqi leader in a third country. Page A11.]
An Iraqi familiar with official thinking said Mr. Hussein's hard line today was in response to a radio address by Mr. Bush on Saturday.
 
Little Hope for Geneva
 The Bush address seemed to rule out the possibility that the Geneva talks could have diplomatic content beyond a restatement of the United Nations resolutions calling for Iraq's withdrawal and Mr. Bush's determination to go to war to enforce them. Baghdad is preparing itself for the failure of the Geneva meeting, the Iraqi said.
Mr. Hussein told the more than a million men he has under arms that they were facing a long and costly war whose aims would be to hold Kuwait, to drive foreign forces out of Saudi Arabia and to create a Palestinian homeland by confronting Israel. "The battle for the liberation of Palestine will not be a short one if we are serious about it," he said, "and we don't believe that the sacrifices will be small."
The tone of Mr. Hussein's speech today, near the eve of the critical meeting on Wednesday between Mr. Aziz and Mr. Baker, was viewed by Western and other foreign diplomats as an attempt to project Iraq's military and political determination and to keep up the pressure on the diplomatic process.
"This was not a direct speech to the West," said a diplomatic mission chief whose Government is part of the military alliance confronting Iraq. "This was a speech really for the army, for Iraqis and for the Arab nation."
 
Iraqi Sees No Compromise
 Iraqis said that Mr. Hussein was preparing his country's 17 million people for the possibility of war and that a number of Iraqi Government officials thought the prospect of war had grown because there was no narrowing of the gap between Iraq's position and the unconditional demand by the United Nations that the hundreds of thousands of Iraqi forces in Kuwait leave in 10 days.
Iraq does not intend to honor the Jan. 15 deadline set by the Security Council, the Iraqi familiar with official thinking said.
In this tense period of brinkmanship, Government officials here said there was a conscious effort in all public statements to convey an unwavering Iraqi resolve to go to war if necessary, while signaling through diplomatic contacts that Iraq is willing to make "sacrifices," or concessions, on Kuwait in a high-level dialogue on all regional disputes between Mr. Baker and Mr. Hussein in Baghdad.
On Friday, President Bush ruled out any mission by Mr. Baker to Baghdad, but Iraqi officials are said to be focused on arranging such a dialogue at the Geneva talks in a way that would effectively prolong the Jan. 15 deadline.
 
A Mixed Signal?
 Even as Mr. Hussein spoke in absolute terms about Kuwait, foreign diplomats taking official soundings in Iraq's Foreign Ministry continued to receive signals that Iraq's position on Kuwait was not absolute. In official contacts, those diplomats have been referred to a statement issued on Dec. 17 by the ruling Revolutionary Command Council stating Iraq's "belief" that Kuwait was part of Iraq and that this belief could never be shaken.
That statement also said: "We want peace. We want dialogue for peace. We respect legitimacy, and we want the international law to be applied on the causes of the Arab nation."
Foreign diplomats who heard Mr. Hussein's speech today reported a mixed reaction. An Eastern European ambassador said he was "disappointed" because he had been hoping that Mr. Hussein would make reference to the prospect of a diplomatic resolution.
Another chief of mission pointed out that Mr. Hussein had not personally criticized Mr. Bush, as he has in recent speeches.
For his part, Mr. Hussein seemed intent on building morale in his armed forces at a time when popular sentiment against the war was rampant in many part of this heavily policed society.
 
A Small Pay Raise
 Last week, Mr. Hussein moved to lift military morale by decreeing a pay raise of 50 dinars for every enlisted man and officer. He moved after complaints that transportation costs to and from the front for reservists going home on weekends was eating up military salaries.
The average Iraqi soldier makes about 100 dinars a month. That amount translates to $322 at the official central bank rate, but soaring inflation has degraded the dinar's value so that the purchasing power of 100 dinars has sunk to about $20.
Iraqis who have been called up to active duty report that absenteeism is running 20 percent or more at regional military centers, where reactivated soliders must report daily. Transportation costs for such duty can run as high as 40 dinars a day, quickly outrunning military salaries and leading to widespread grumbling.
At the same time, Mr. Hussein's full mobilization of his society is regarded as an impressive achievement by a number of foreign analysts, who say the Iraqis are capable of enduring great hardships if called on to do so by the leadership.
In rallying his armed forces today, Mr. Hussein said the battle that Iraq faced was a battle that must consolidate several objectives.
"It cannot be a battle that could be divided into several causes," he said. "On the contrary, this could cause confusion, which will divide the ranks, because if we fight divided battles, the forces working against us could probably neutralize our efforts."
 
'Battle Against Tyranny'
 "But if we fight the battle as one battle," he continued, "a battle that includes and embraces all the objectives of the Arabs at this particular phase, then this is the advantage of the great battle which we will fight."
He said the "battle against tyranny represented by the American Administration" to get "the forces of atheism to leave the holy land of Muslims" and to secure "the liberation of Palestine is not expected to be a short one."
Mr. Hussein said Iraq possessed advantages in any war, and he referred to "facilities of strategic nature that could not be imagined elsewhere -- flow and speed in communications, mobilization and military logisitics" as integral to Iraq's military strengths. His reference to strategic facilities echoed earlier references to Iraq's medium-range ballistic missiles.
Iraq in recent weeks has test-fired several modified Scud-B missiles, which its forces used extensively in the last stages of the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980's to terrorize Iranian cities. Iran also fired Scud-B missiles at Iraq.
Last month, returning Iraqi reservists trained in rocketry were said to have been immediately deployed to their units. While Iraq possesses several dozen mobile launchers for the modified Scud-B missiles, the rocket forces have erected about fixed launch sites in the western Iraqi desert for Scud-B missiles, whose ballistic warheads could reach targets in Syria and Israel.
 
'Miserable Coffins'
 Mr. Hussein praised the military leadership he has streamlined in preparation for further military action. In November the Iraqi President named a new armed forces chief of staff, and last month he named a new Defense Minister, both veterans of the successful final campaigns of the eight-year war against Iran.
"The mother of battles will also be conducted under experienced, cohesive military leadership," Mr. Hussein said. "These are the advantages of the battle."
In a commemorative issue today, Iraq's state-run newspaper, Al Jumhouriya, exceeded the bellicose tenor of Mr. Hussein's speech with an editorial that said, "Saddam Hussein's army will trample under the feet of its heroes the heads of Bush's soldiers, crush their bones and send them to America wrapped in miserable coffins."

U.N. Mission Discussed
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (Special to the New York Times) -- During their meeting at Camp David on Saturday, President Bush and the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, discussed the possibility that Mr. Perez de Cuellar might go to Baghdad if the meeting between Mr. Baker and Mr, Aziz in Geneva produced no results, an Administration official said tonight.
The United States would not stand in the way of such a trip, but would not encourage it either, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Mr. Perez de Cuellar raised the idea of traveling to Baghdad during a discussion with Mr. Bush about Mr. Baker's scheduled meeting on Wednesday with Foreign Minister Aziz, the official said.
 
Israeli Sees War Threat
 JERUSALEM, Jan. 6 (REUTERS) -- Foreign Minister David Levy said today that President Hussein's statement that his army was ready for the "mother of battles" to hold Kuwait and liberate Palestine amounted to a declaration of war.
Mr. Levy made the comment as hundreds of foreigners fearing that a gulf war might spread to Israel flew home, nine days ahead of the United Nations deadline for Iraq to pull out or be forced out.
Mr. Levy said Israel was not declaring war on Iraq but would deal a serious blow to Baghdad if it attacked Israel. Mr. Hussein has said Tel Aviv would be Iraq's first target if was attacked by the forces in the gulf.

HEADLINE: A Success Story Turn Sour in New England

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
In only a year, the Bank of New England was transformed from a regional banking powerhouse into a ward of the state, waiting for Federal regulators to choose how and when they will sell it.
While the weakening of the New England economy undoubtedly hurt, the last year has made clear that the company's most severe problems were the result of its own mistakes. It lent an astounding 36.7 percent of its total loans for risky commercial real estate projects, far more than neighboring banks, and it failed to adequately manage subsidiary banks and reduce costs. 
 By the time a new management team headed by Lawrence K. Fish was installed early last year, it was too late. Like a leaky boat that fills with water faster than it can be bailed out, bad loans kept emerging faster than the company could solve its problems by slashing its payroll and selling subsidiaries.
"There were just too many bad loans," said Mr. Fish, who will continue as chairman despite yesterday's Federal takeover of three of the Bank of New England Corporation's banking subsidiaries: Bank of New England, Connecticut Bank and Trust, and Maine National Bank.
"It was a classic lesson in the failure to diversify risk," Mr. Fish said. "The Bank of New England lent too much, too agressively, too quickly, for a number of years."
 
Growth Through Acquisitions
 For years, the company profited from the booming economy in New England and a series of acquisitions that greatly increased its size. In 1985, the Bank of New England acquired large banks in Connecticut, Maine and Rhode Island, vaulting in a single year from a $22 billion Massachusetts company to a large regional concern that for a time in 1989 was the nation's 18th-largest banking company.
When the problems came to light, the blame fell largely on Walter J. Connolly Jr., who, as chairman, had led the acquistion binge and then pushed the company further into the real estate business in the last half of the 1980's.
Loans for commercial real estate were especially attractive when the local economy was strong because they produced the high profits needed to pay for expensive acquisitions. But by September 1990, with the New England economy soured, almost half the loans the company had made for construction projects, and nearly 20 percent of its mortgage loans for commercial projects, were delinquent. The company holds $3.3 billion of loans that are seriously delinquent or in such trouble that payments are not expected when due.
 
Huge Loss Reported
 The lending problems emerged about a year ago when the company stunned Wall Street and its shareholders by announcing a $1.23 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 1989. The loss resulted from a Federal bank examination, the first of several reviews of lending at New England banks.
The quality of the Bank of New England's loans was so poor, and the record-keeping so inadequate, regulators found, that they "read the riot act" to the bank's management, one of its directors said at the time.
Although the loss announced a year ago left the company with a very small capitial cushion to absorb additional losses, banking regulators did not move immediately to close the company. Instead, they gave it time to solve its problems by cutting payroll, selling businesses and reorganizing activities.
Regulators had hoped that the still-solid consumer branch networks of the Bank of New England, which is based in Boston and is the largest bank in the state, and of Connecticut Bank and Trust, based in Hartford and the second-largest bank in that state, would be enough to pull the company through its troubles.
 
Talk of Bond Swap
 But fresh infusions of capital, a key part of the survival plan, were slow to come. Proposals by bondholders of the Bank of New England Corporation to exchange their bonds for stock were actively discussed in the past week but not completed.
As bad loans mounted, the company set aside reserves for loan losses, causing a steady stream of losses amounting to about $650 million in 1990, on top of the $1.23 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 1989.
Mr. Fish said that as the problems intensified in the last few months, other banks, insurance companies and wealthy people became even more reluctant to lend for real estate projects, and Bank of New England's losses grew as it had a hard time salvaging its bad loans by arranging refinancings or partial payments.
"Late last week, they came to Washington and said, 'We just can't push this rock up the hill any longer,' " Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency, said in an interview last night.
On Friday, the company announced that it would lose up to $450 million in the fourth quarter, mostly as a result of losses on its delinquent real estate loans.
The fourth-quarter loss would have left the company insolvent, a condition that did not inspire confidence in the fate of its subsidiary banks. As withdrawals increased on Friday and Saturday to as much as three times their normal level, regulators and Bank of New England executives agreed it was time for a new strategy.
Three of the corporation's banks were declared insolvent; they will reopen today as new banks, owned by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The banks' books will be open for examination by potential buyers, while shareholders and bondholders will be left to fight over the scraps of assets, estimated to be worth about $50 million.

HEADLINE: BUSH MAY CALL OFF FEBRUARY MEETING WITH SOVIET CHIEF

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
In the clearest sign of newly emerging problems in Soviet-American relations, President Bush is on the verge of postponing a summit meeting scheduled for Moscow in February because of differences over arms control and uncertainty in the Persian Gulf, Administration officials said tonight.
"We have been going over the prospects for the summit thoroughly in the last few days and there is now a strong possibility that there may not be a meeting in Moscow next month," said an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The official said the Soviet Union has not been formally notified of a decision to cancel the meeting between Mr. Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. "But they won't be surprised when it happens, and I don't think they'll be too grief-stricken either," the official said. Word that the summit meeting might be canceled was first reported tonight by the Cable News Network.
 
Vehicle for Arms Treaty
 The summit was scheduled as the vehicle for Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush to sign a new treaty that would cut long-range nuclear weapons. But an official said tonight that work on that treaty was proceeding more slowly than had been anticipated, and that there have been significant disputes between the countries over another treaty cutting conventional arms in Europe. That treaty was signed in Paris last November.
Senior officials said last week that Congress had made it clear that the conventional arms treaty should not be submitted for approval until those problems had been cleared up, and they said that it would not be possible to proceed to the second treaty on nuclear weapons until the disputes over conventional arms were resolved.
Officials said tonight that the situation was uncertain enough that it made the summit meeting seem like a bad idea. "In addition, the uncertainties about the situation in the gulf also led us to reconsider the schedule," an official said.
 
U.S.-Soviet Differences
 Soviet and American differences over the conventional arms treaty center on American charges that the Soviet Union has evaded counting and verification rules in the treaty.
Senior American officials say that a resurgence of Soviet military influence is behind the Soviet actions, and some also say that political turmoil in Moscow is to blame for the unexpected difficulties in completing negotiations on technical issues in the nuclear arms treaty, including verification and encoding provisions.
Although senior officials at the White House and State Department said last week that they generally accepted Mr. Gorbachev's assurances that he wanted to clear up both treaties and that Soviet foreign policy would not change dramatically, the difficulties in arms control were a dramatic sign of how Soviet internal politics could affect relations between the superpowers.
The officials acknowledged that for the first time since Mr. Bush took office, indeed perhaps since Mr. Gorbachev himself came to power in 1985, the forward momentum in Soviet-American affairs is now slowing.
 Even without any change in Soviet foreign policy, officials said, a crackdown on political activity in the Soviet Union could make the way Moscow handles its internal affairs a negative force in Soviet-American relations, just as it was during the cold war.
Citing the Soviet military's current occupation of a printing plant in Latvia, a senior policy maker said, "There is no question that some of these strong-arm tactics, if they continue, are going to cause problems in the U.S.-Soviet relationship."
 
Bush-Gorbachev Ties
 That, officials said, could could make it harder for Mr. Bush to maintain the warm relationship with Mr. Gorbachev that is so central to Soviet-American relations. Not only would that pose difficulties for a President who relies on his personal contacts, but it comes at a bad time: Mr. Gorbachev's cooperation in the Persian Gulf has been pivotal to Mr. Bush's ability to build and hold together the coalition against Iraq.
As Mr. Gorbachev works to bring order to his country, such considerations will require Washington to strike what a senior official called a "fine balance" between self-interest, like insuring Soviet cooperation in the Persian Gulf, and broader principles like freedom of political expression.
"Everything that Gorbachev does he is bound to say is designed to help promote the reform process, and I don't doubt that's what he means," another official said. "But even if you don't intend things to happen, there are consequences of relying on the old forms of government. It's one thing if there are ethnic pogroms and you have to stop killing. It's something else if you are denying people the right to express themselves politically."
 
Crackdown in China
 Mr. Bush faced this problem after the crackdown on political dissent in China. He made two hotly debated overtures to the Chinese in hopes of improving relations with Beijing, a policy that White House officials have admitted was a failure.
There are differences among American officials over how much Mr. Gorbachev is threatened and how far he would go in exercising his powers. But there is a consensus that the Soviet political situation is likely to worsen as economic conditions worsen and the component republics assert themselves.
Administration officials said they did not know exactly how strong Mr. Gorbachev's position was and could not predict his next moves with confidence. Some officials said they would not be surprised if Mr. Gorbachev imposed martial law or some less dramatic form of "presidential rule" selectively in areas where separatist movements or ethnic tensions are particularly strong. "But we do not expect anything like a nationwide imposition of martial law," an official said.
 
Warning by Shevardnadze
 Although the Administration has been concerned for some time about a drift back to strict central control in the Soviet Union, the resignation of Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze sharply increased their worries. On Dec. 22, Mr. Bush noted Mr. Shevardnadze's warnings of impending dictatorship and added, "Obviously, people are concerned about, are wondering about the concerns raised and expressed by Mr. Shevardnadze."
The President said he would watch Soviet policy "very closely" but took comfort in Moscow's assurances that its foreign policy would not change. "I will continue to work with this new and very encouraging bilateral relationship, work to enhance that in every way possible," he said.
The next week, after meetings in Washington and Moscow, American officials said they were convinced that Mr. Gorbachev remained fully in charge of Soviet foreign policy, at least for the time being. Since Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation, a senior official said: "For the most part, we have not seen any real change in Soviet foreign policy. But the one area where we are having a problem is in arms control, where there clearly is a resurgence of the military's influence."
 
Arms-Control Problems
 Administration officials generally said the Soviet military was responsible for the disputes between the Soviet Union and the United States over the newly signed treaty on conventional weapons in Europe.
The United States has said the Soviet Union's figures on the size of its forces are too low, that Moscow has improperly moved some weapons out of the area covered by the treaty and that the Soviet military has arbitrarily reassigned other weapons to the navy to avoid having them covered.
But there was some division about whether the military was responsible for the problems involving the proposed treaty reducing long-range nuclear weapons, which center on technical issues, like the coding of signals to missiles and the flight testing of some rockets, that are proving harder to resolve than initially anticipated.
As a result, the signing of that document by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, an event that once seemed almost routine, is now something of a test of the state of Soviet-American relations.
To some degree, the Bush Administration is where it was two years ago: trying to decide how much to support Mr. Gorbachev.
 
'A Fundamental Struggle'
 "To the extent that Gorbachev has done things that were in our interest, we wanted to pursue them," an official said. "Now we're watching a fundamental struggle and we don't know what's going to come out. But in the end we're not going to be the arbiters of success there, and we have to pursue policies beneficial to our broader concerns. That means our position is to be supportive of Gorbachev, but specifically with the idea this is a guy who helped bring about reform and we want to see that reform process go forward."
The United States also has been groping for ways to prepare for the possibility that Mr. Gorbachev's personal authority -- indeed that of the Moscow Government in general -- could be reduced.
At the urging of Soviet visitors and American experts on the Soviet Union, Washington has quietly moved to expand its contacts outside the Kremlin, officials said. This requires a tricky diplomatic formula.
Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d have met with the heads of the Baltic republics, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, which the United States does not recognize as Soviet territory.
 
Lower Level Contacts
 But officials from the republics of Armenia, Kazakhstan, the Ukraine, Russia and Byelorussia were received at a lower level, by Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, and by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, to avoid alienating Mr. Gorbachev or inflaming Soviet tensions.
Mr. Bush arranged a quick and ostensibly impromptu meeting with Boris N. Yeltsin, when he was at the White House last year before his election as President of the huge Russian republic.
The Administration has also tried to extend assistance to republic, regional and city governments in the Soviet Union on matters like banking regulation, economic reform and court systems.
"But that really is just conceptual so far," an official said. "It is difficult to arrange, and the money for these kinds of programs is in Moscow, not outlying areas."
But there is little the United States can do in these areas, officials said, because it has no realistic alternative to the central authorities who control the Soviet economy, the Soviet military and, especially, the Soviet nuclear arsenal.

HEADLINE: Turning Disease Into Political Cause: First AIDS, and Now Breast Cancer

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Women with breast cancer are taking a lesson from AIDS advocacy groups and using political action to urge the Federal and state governments to pay more attention to their disease.
"They showed us how to get through to the Government," said Shiela Swanson, a breast cancer patient in the Bay Area who helped organize an advocacy group called Y-Me. "They took on an archaic system and turned it around while we have been quietly dying." 
 In cities like San Francisco, Dallas, Washington, Berkeley, Calif., and Cambridge, Mass., breast cancer advocacy groups have recently been formed to press demands for more action on the disease, which strikes one in 11 American women and kills almost a third of its victims.
The groups are lobbying for more money for research, broader insurance coverage for mammograms and experimental treatments and the resumption of stalled studies into the possible dietary or environmental roots of breast cancer. The groups have been particularly successful on the state level in requiring insurance companies to pay for mammograms.
 
Lessons From AIDS
 Organizers of the groups say they were inspired by the effectiveness of advocates for people with AIDS, but experts in health policy note other factors.
The incidence of breast cancer is increasing and beginning to touch the lives of women and men in the huge baby boom generation. And the Federal Government, in the midst of a debate over how to allocate scarce research money to various diseases, has recently conceded that women have not been properly represented in biomedical research.
But the lessons of AIDS provide the immediate impetus for the growing activism around breast cancer. Until the AIDS epidemic, advocates for people with a certain disease had never had such a broad influence on public policy. Advocates for people with AIDS have forced an overhaul in the way AIDS drugs are tested, released and financed and have successfully lobbied the Government for billions of dollars for research, treatment and education at a time of fiscal restraint. In fact, the Government spends nearly as much each year on AIDS research as it does on all cancers combined.
"They have scored incredible coups," said Marguerite Donoghue, a lobbyist for the National Coalition of Cancer Research. "They've left all of us saying, 'Boy, let's learn from their techniques.' "
 
'Perfectly Appropriate'
 The techniques of the breast cancer groups have so far been focused on lobbying for legislation, with only a smattering of street actions similar to those of Act-Up, a radical AIDS organization. With a largely moderate approach and a focus more on prevention and possible cures than on drug trials, the new groups have not antagonized Government researchers and have won tentative praise.
Dr. Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute, said in a telephone interview that he welcomed the new advocacy as a means of prying more money from Congress to be spent on a wide variety of worthy research projects. "It is perfectly appropriate and in my opinion helpful to have concerned women focus on the problem," Dr. Broder said.
Although the breast cancer groups say they are not competing with AIDS organizations for money and attention, they point out the disparity in Government spending on the diseases: $1.1 billion in federally financed AIDS research in the 1990 fiscal year, for a disease that killed more than 23,000 last year, versus $77 million for breast cancer, which killed more than 43,000 Americans that year.
Federal health officials say the comparison is specious because AIDS is a contagious disease and because the death toll from it is likely to surpass that from breast cancer in years to come.
In addition, Federal officials note that breast cancer receives more Government money than any other cancer, including lung cancer, which claims 142,000 lives each year. And millions of dollars more is spent each year on basic research on cancer in general.
Over all, with adjustments for inflation, the Federal Government is spending 4.6 percent less for cancer research than it did in 1980, Ms. Donoghue said. The National Cancer Institute did not itemize spending for individual forms of cancer until recently, so no similar comparison can be made about spending on breast cancer.
 
Success in Congress
 The militancy around breast cancer comes as Federal lawmakers are calling attention to broad inequities regarding women's health. Last spring, at the urging of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, studied the performance of the National Institutes of Health and found that the nation's principal source of money for biomedical research was largely excluding women from its studies.
About the same time, the Caucus for Women's Issues proposed more than a dozen bills on health issues. The 101st Congress passed two of them: an extension of Medicare to cover mammograms for women over 65 years old and the establishment of a $30 million screening program for breast and cervical cancer in poor communities, where women die of these diseases in disproportionate numbers.
Representative Mary Rose Oakar, an Ohio Democrat who sponsored many of the breast cancer bills, said the comparison to AIDS spending was a powerful way to convert other lawmakers to her cause but must be broached gingerly.
"You make the pitch that if we can do it to AIDS we can do it for women," Ms. Oakar said. "But you can't buy into the right-wing philosophy that there shouldn't be AIDS research. We shouldn't be pitting breast cancer against AIDS. We should be pitting it against 'Star Wars.' "
Ms. Oakar said she has also made progress in Congress by seeking the help of lawmakers whose wives have had breast cancer. "There are at least 10 of them," she said. "And when it hits your family, boy, do attitudes change."
 
Effects of the Baby Boom
 The power of breast cancer as a issue, experts in health policy say, comes in part from demographics. As a result of the baby boom, there are more and more women in their 40's, who at that age are facing an array of health problems, including breast cancer.
"The women politicized in the 70's are talking about their own health when they talk about breast cancer," said Andrea Camp, an aide to Representative Patricia Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat who is co-chairwoman of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues.
Also, Ms. Camp and others said, breast cancer is an issue that cuts across the political spectrum and creates a consensus that has never been reached on over abortion, the primary women's health issue of recent decades.
Among the groups pressing for more attention are the Women's Cancer Resource Center in Berkeley, which was founded by lesbians, and the Komen Foundation for Breast Cancer in Dallas, a bastion of rich and socially prominent Republican women.
The Komen Foundation shepherded bills through the Texas Legislature in 1987 and 1989 that forced insurance companies to reimburse the cost of mammograms for all women age 35 and over and required doctors to tell women of all the alternative treatments for their breast tumors. Twenty-five states have now followed Texas's lead on some form of insurance coverage for mammograms.
 
Roots of Inspiration
 Since the 1960's, interest in women's health issues has been driven by feminists, who urged women to take control of medical decisions previously reserved for physicians.
It was this movement that inspired the gay community in the early days of AIDS. "Most people have no awareness that that is where our roots are," said Eric Rofes, the executive director of the Shanti Project, an AIDS service organization in San Francisco.
These days the inspiration is flowing in the opposite direction.
When Elenore Pred founded Breast Cancer Action here, she turned to the AIDS organizations for help. She prepared for political action by attending seminars at the International AIDS Conference here last spring and learned the vocabulary of drug research and regulation by meeting with the staff of the publication AIDS Treatment News.
"AIDS has created a terrible, wonderful model for us all," she said.
AIDS activism is also the template for the Women's Community Cancer Project in Cambridge, a group that recently demonstrated in Boston at a conference on breast diseases. "We see a parallel situation, also deadly, where people have gotten somewhere by taking this kind of action," said Ellen Crowley Overlan, a leader of the group.
A few of the more politically radical women are imitating Act-Up,, which has disrupted medical meetings and Roman Catholic Masses and which plasters its slogan, "Silence Equals Death," on buildings. A few months ago, a billboard appeared on Valencia Street, the main artery of San Francisco's lesbian community, reading: "Thirty women dead from breast cancer every hour. Marked for death by the National Cancer Institute."
At the same time, advocates for breast cancer patients are pressing their cause in Congress, where a bill to set Federal standards for mammography is pending; in the courts, where women are suing insurance companies for not covering experimental treatments, and in mainstream women's organizations, which are taking a fresh look at health issues.
"Almost every woman in the country has lost someone dear to her due to the neglect of the health-care establishment," said Carolin Head, an official with the American Association of University Women, whose 135,000 members voted last year for the first time to endorse legislation on women's health issues.
"More and more women will be engaged in political action around these issues in the 1990's," Ms. Head said. "That's my crystal ball."

HEADLINE: Rhode Island Announces Bank Withdrawal Plan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Jan. 6

 BODY:
Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun of Rhode Island has announced emergency withdrawal plans for residents left without money after he ordered 45 banks and credit unions to close last week.
Mr. Sundlun shut the institutions last week after their private insurer, the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation, turned to the state for protection. About 300,000 accounts containing $1.7 billion were frozen. 
 On Saturday, the Governor announced a plan to help depositors in "dire economic need."
"These regulations are designed to give depositors enough money to meet their immediate needs for essentials," he said. "In addition, there will be access to safety-deposit boxes at these institutions by appointment."
To qualify for emergency treatment, depositors must show imminent foreclosure on or eviction from a principal residence; need for necessary, non-elective medical treatment; maintenance of medical insurance; need of food or heating oil, or imminent termination of a utility.
The Governor's office said applications for emergency withdrawals would be available atabout 11 A.M. Monday at various institutions that remain open, including Fleet National Bank, Hospital Trust, Citizens Bank, Old Stone Bank and Eastland Bank. Checks will be mailed to depositors who qualify.
The Governor said 22 credit unions would reopen on Monday.
The credit unions are the Allied Aftermarket Employees Credit Union, Bostitch Employees Credit Union, Cottrell Employees Credit Union, Coventry Teachers Credit Union, Cumberland School Employees Credit Union, East Bay Industrial Credit Union, East Providence Teachers Credit Union, Federal Products Credit Union, Journal Employees Credit Union, Kent County Memorial Hospital Credit Union, Newport Columbian Credit Union, North Providence Teachers Credit Union, Pawtucket Credit Union, Providence Postal Employees Credit Union, Providence Veterans Administration Hospital Credit Union, Rhode Island State Employees Credit Union, St. Anthony's Credit Union, Vapro Credit Union, Warwick Columbus Credit Union, Warwick Postal Employees Credit Union, Westerly Credit Union and Woonsocket Postal Employees Credit Union.

HEADLINE: U.S. Hardens Trade Stance With Japan

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
The Bush Administration has turned more truculent in its economic relations with Tokyo, reflecting both frustration over Japanese trading policies and unease over a wave of Japanese investments in the United States.
Three Cabinet departments -- Interior, Justice and Treasury -- have recently taken steps that strike at Japan. That the White House has not slapped the wrists of those responsible for these steps, which go against the previous positions of the Bush Administration, is widely seen in Washington as tacit approval of the more aggressive approach. 
 Some officials say the Administration's willingness to get tough stems from Japan's refusal to support an effort by the United States and other food-exporting countries to force the European Community to end agricultural subsidies. That dispute led to the collapse of global trade talks in Brussels last month.
 
Expecting Difficult Year
 "By ducking the issue, Japan gave evidence to those in this country looking for evidence that Japan is not a force for liberalization of world trade," said S. Linn Williams, the deputy United States trade representative.
Mr. Williams, who said he anticipated a difficult year on trade matters with Japan, is leading a negotiating team that will go to Tokyo next week for trade talks.
At that session, the United States is hoping to pin down what steps the Japanese are taking to make good on promises they made last year, in trade talks that ended with a meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
Some Congressional staff members suggested that the newly tough talk could be intended to head off an expected drive in the 102d Congress to enact punitive legislation on foreign investment and trade.
"There's a hard search for new ways for the United States to get tough," said Kevin L. Kearns, former staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is now at the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington research group. "Legislation will begin to take shape that could have a life and momentum of its own."
Some economists link the toughness with the weakening economy. "Whenever you see jobs lost and economic misery rising, these are times when foreigner-bashing activities go up," said Shafiqul Islam, of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
In the most publicized action by Cabinet officials, the Interior Department is trying to prevent the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company from retaining the right to do business in Yosemite National Park. By acquiring MCA Inc. for almost $6.6 billion, Matshushita also bought an MCA subsiary, the Yosemite and Curry Company, that operates park concessions.
 
Profits Flowing Abroad
 Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., who pointedly tells reporters he does not drive a Japanese car, has raised the possibility of trying to cancel the concessions contract, which expires in 1993. In criticizing the low fees such concession contracts provide the Government, Mr. Lujan expressed displeasure that profits from the Yosemite operations would soon flow to a foreign company.
On another front, the Justice Department has said it is preparing to file a civil antitrust lawsuit to block the acquisition of Semi-Gas Systems, an American semiconductor equipment company, by Nippon Sanso K.K. of Japan. That announcement came despite President Bush's finding last year that the deal posed no threat to national security.
Semi-Gas, a unit of Hercules Inc. in Wilmington, Del., makes gas cabinets used in semiconductor production. Its acquisition by the Japanese has been sharply criticized in Congress. The Assistant Attorney General, James F. Rill, said the acquisition would substantially increase the "dominant position" of Semi-Gas Systems in the United States market.
 
Possible Legal Sanctions
 And in another indication of a tougher attitude on trade, the Treasury Department is considering supporting the Fair Trade in Financial Services Act, which failed to became law in the waning hours of Congress last year. Should this occur, it would mark the first time the Administration had supported legislation permitting discretionary sanctions against a country that allowed American companies fewer investment opportunities than its companies enjoyed in the United States.
The bill, sponsored by the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, would empower Federal banking regulators to deny applications by foreign banks for branches if the Treasury Secretary determined that equivalent competitive opportunities were not available in the foreign bank's home market.
A recent Treasury study found that Japanese banks now conduct more than 25 percent of the lending in California, while foreign banks' share of total lending in Japan actually fell to 1.7 percent at the end of last year, from 3.5 percent in 1983.
 
A Shift in Position
 The Justice and Interior complaints about Japanese investments are a sharp contrast to previously expressed positions of the Bush and Reagan Administrations, which generally found that virtually any foreign acquisition was acceptable.
"The actions are clearly motivated not only by concern over foreign investment but by displeasure with Japan's grudging contribution in the gulf crisis and the perception of trade unfairness," said Bradley R. Larschan, general counsel of the Association for International Investment.
In the Tokyo trade talks next week, the American focus will be persuading Japan to make good on pledges to stiffen enforcement against monopoly practices. But Washington is up against powerful Japanese business groups that fiercely oppose any change.
"We feel strongly that adequate enforcement would go a long way to open up the Japanese market," said Mr. Williams, the deputy trade representative.
 
Making Fines Higher
 One issue is the fines that would be imposed on Japanese companies caught in restraint of trade. These fines, which the Bush Administration says are too low, amount to only 2 percent of the sales affected by the illegal monopoly practices. In the United States, the fine is 50 percent of affected sales.
While the United States and Japan have made some progress on trade -- Japanese markets in wood products, telecommunications and other sectors have been opened somewhat -- trade tensions remain high.
"There are still American industries that find it more difficult to sell in Japan than market forces would justify," said Mr. Williams, who practiced law in Japan before joining the trade office two years ago.
While the total Japanese investment in the United States was valued at $75.8 billion by the Commerce Department through last year's third quarter -- well below the $121.6 billion of Britain -- Mr. Larschan of the investment association said the perception of unfairness in Japan reflects how little foreign investment has been made there. Commerce Department figures show that in 1989, American investment in Japan was $19.3 billion.
"There is a growing sense of unease among some of the staunchest defenders of international investment freedom that Japan does not play fair and that something has to be done about it," Mr. Larschan noted.
 
Punitive Legislation
 One possible result is that Congress might enact punitive legislation. Mr. Larschan predicted that the legislative initiatives would develop along four main tracks: stronger efforts to bar investments affecting perceived national and economic security; more attention on foreign influence in the political process; a focus on foreign-owned companies' payment of United States taxes, and measures involving specific industries.
Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Telecommunications subcommittee, has proposed, for example, that foreign owernship of American cable television systems be restricted.
Under a 1988 law that established procedures for national security review of foreign direct investment, President Bush has blocked only one foreign takeover -- a Chinese company's efforts to acquire Mamco Manufacturing Inc. in Seattle, which supplies aircraft components.
Although the 1988 law has temporarily lapsed, the President is reviewing one Japanese proposal that has stirred controversy here -- the takeover by Fanuc, the Japanese robot and machine-tool company, of the Moore Specialty Tool Company of Bridgeport, Conn. Moore makes precision tools that are used to build casings for the fissionable parts of nuclear weapons.

HEADLINE: A Champion of the Sweet Tooth Is Closed

BYLINE: By ROBERT E. TOMASSON

 BODY:
Another New York landmark closed up shop yesterday. As the last prune Danishes, coffee cakes and Rigo Jancsi chocolate cakes went over the counter, customers shook their heads sadly, as if they were losing a member of the family with the death of Grossinger's Home Bakery.
The closing of a small, worn shop -- only 14 feet wide and 50 feet long -- after 55 years was hardly a ripple in the city's sea of economic troubles. In some ways, it could be considered a sign of economic vitality, since the store on Columbus Avenue at 75th Street will soon be joined with five vacant stores on either side of it into a glistening department store selling jeans and designer sweatsuits. 
 But for thousands of customers like Nancy Franco and Richard Mendelsohn the closing means the end of a habit or a link to childhood memories. For the neighborhood, it is a loss of smells and tastes and heritage, the sort of social landmark that defined a community for three generations.
Ms. Franco is 31 years old now, married,and lives around the corner on 75th Street. After growing up in the neighborhood, the family moved to the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
Her grandmother, Florence Ditchik, 86, never moved away. Ms. Franco moved back after being married, and now lives in the same building as her grandmother. And she came back to the bakery.
"The sugar doughnuts," she said, a warm grin spreading across her face. "They were something, coming in as a kid."
Mr. Mendelsohn has been stopping by Grossinger's for 25 years and on its last day bought a birthday cake that he will freeze until his birthday next week."I'd come in here and argue with your mother," Mr. Mendelsohn said gesturing to the owner, Herb Grossinger. "She kept trying to tell me that day-old prune Danish was better than fresh, 'like good wine,' she'd say.
"I'd say, 'I'm buying Danish, not wine,' " Mr. Mendelsohn said.
"Well actually, some older people do say that day-old prune Danish does have some medicinal qualities," the 51-year-old owner said, quite ready to sustain the singular theory of his mother, Isabella.
Isabella Grossinger died in August 1983, and much of the neighborhood mourned. She was 75, lived above the store and was dressed in her blue uniform, ready for work, when she died.
"That was when the phone in the bakery also rang upstairs, so we could take orders anytime," remembered her son.
It was also a time that Mr. Grossinger described as when "families lived together, ate together and had Grossinger desserts to gether." The customers still come in, he said, but habits for sweets have changed. The rent is $5,000 a month and with the lease up next month, the building owner said he was not interested in keeping the bakery in the midst of an assemblage of property that is geared more toward the kind of upscale boutiques and restaurants that clog Columbus Avenue now than the family businesses that lined the street when the store opened.
"The profit margin is narrower and narrower," Mr. Grossinger said.
But with transformation perhaps being more a trait of New York than demise, Grossinger's will live on in more ways than one. Several blocks north on Columbus Avenue is Grossinger's Uptown Shommer Shabbos Bakery. The main difference from the 75th Street bakery -- aside from memories -- is that it is kosher and therefore closed on Saturdays.
The bakery on 86th Street was started in 1946 by Jerry Stefanas, a baker employed by Ernest Grossinger, Herb's father, who died in 1972. The bakery, with a Greek flavor, sold only wholesale. The Grossingers bought it in 1981, started selling retail, and became kosher in 1988.
And Grossinger's will continue to place one product especially in some of the city's most expensive restaurants, albeit under a pseudonym.
"We wanted a very fancy dessert, but with a French soud, not Grossinger's," the owner said. Thus was born bombe glace, a praline ice-cream cake layered with hazelnut meringue, a dish that merits mention in many restaurant reviews.
One of the proudest, unverifiable and emphatic claims of the Grossinger's Home Bakery is that it is the home of the ice-cream cake.
Ernest Grossinger came to the United States in 1914 and Isabella Grossinger in 1929. In 1930 the first cousins with the same surname -- neither any relation to the Grossingers of Catskills fame -- were married and the bakery came into being.
Mr. Grossinger said he believed his store was one of the last Hungarian bakeries on the West Side. Most are on the East Side, including Budapest Pastry at 207 East 84th Street and the Rigo Hungarian Viennese Pastry at 314 East 78th Street, providing mounds of caloric evidence that the sweet tooth may have been hereditary in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
"It's depressing," Elizabeth Grossinger, 15, the daughter of the owner, said of the closing. "This is where my dad grew up, living upstairs working down here," she said, adding proudly that she has been working in the store "since I was 8."

When America Gave A Poor Account of Itself

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
If anyone can find comfort in the economic pains of the present from the recollection of miseries past, "After the Crash" should provide it. Tonight's chapter of "The American Experience," at 9 on Channels 13 and 49 and at 10:30 on Channel 21, tells of the bitter years 1930 to 1932, when hunger, homelessness and hopelessness spread through the land, and the United States seemed close to revolution.
The hourlong documentary supplements the evocative newsreels and photographs that have become hallmarks of this series with firsthand descriptions of the tough times that were burned into survivors' memories. Rural areas and big cities were hit equally hard. A drought in the summer of 1930 brought ruin to the Cotton Belt. 
 "The ground busted open," says a woman who grew up in Arkansas. In Detroit, a quarter of a million people found themselves out of work.
Federal relief programs were almost nonexistent. The narrator, Jason Robards, recalls that President Herbert Hoover, whose appearances here confirm his uncharismatic reputation, counted on private charity and local governments to manage a situation that had become unmanageable. He did not speak of points of light: Self-reliance was his theme; direct aid from Washington was not. In the South, the Red Cross worked through the plantation owners who had always controlled sharecroppers' lives. In the North, evictions led to the spread of shantytowns. Desperation bred an anger that was worked on by Communist organizers.
The painful pictures bring back such events as a march on an Arkansas grocery store by several hundred starving farmers, who managed to obtain $2.50 worth of food apiece, and big demonstrations and clashes with the police by automobile workers in Detroit. At what came to be known as the massacre at River Rouge, four workers were killed in a march on the Ford plant in Dearborn.
 "After the Crash" has a powerful account of the 1932 journey to Washington by thousands of World War I veterans demanding the bonus that had been promised to them for the future. We see grim families passing wearily in front of the Capitol in what they called a death march. Congress did not respond. Troops were called in -- "two rival armies of Americans" confronted each other, says the narrator -- and soon Gen. Douglas MacArthur, exceeding White House orders, demolished the veterans' shanties. A woman says, "America didn't give a good account of itself that night."
The program ends with poignant pictures of the defeated veterans on their way home, American flags still unfurled, though no longer flying, and a slow-motion scene of President Hoover in his losing 1932 campaign for re-election. He seems to be fading out of history, along with his faith in private charity and self-reliance.
 
After the Crash
 
Written by Steve Fayer; produced by Eric Neudel for "The American Experience"; Henry Hampton, executive producer; Jason Robards, narrator. At 9 tonight on Channels 13 and 49; at 10:30 P.M. on Channel 21.

HEADLINE: Challenges and Rewards of Filming in New York

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Deep in the winter of New York's discontent, when film making in the Big Apple has nearly come to a standstill because of cold weather and the lingering effects of a labor dispute, a hardy band of film makers is fighting gridlock, inflationary costs, chill winds and the wail of sirens to shoot an entire movie in New York City, about a quintessential New York theme: a slumlord who gets his comeuppance.
The movie, a gritty comedy, is called "The Super," and not only has its shooting schedule been a street-smart tour of the East Village, Harlem and Bushwick in Brooklyn, but it also stars some quintessential New York actors. They include Joe Pesci, celebrated recently for playing the volatile wise guy Tommy DeVito in Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas" as well as a bumbling burglar in "Home Alone," and Vincent Gardenia, best remembered for his role as Cher's father, the plumber, in "Moonstruck." The film also features Ruben Blades, who appeared in "Mo' Better Blues," "The Two Jakes" and "The Milagro Beanfield War." 
 The story of the production's New York odyssey since filming began on Oct. 29 sums up the joys and the nightmares of movie making in Gotham, and vividly demonstrates not only why producers often feel compelled to bring their productions to town, but also, paradoxically, why they often feel like fleeing from the city in terror. "New York is a character itself in this movie," said Charles Gordon, the film's producer, who also produced the Oscar-nominated "Field of Dreams." "What kind of character, I'm not all that sure."
 
A Game of Cards
 In "The Super" Mr. Pesci plays another of his not-very-nice guys: Lou Kritski, a Scrooge-like landlord whose transgressions against his tenants are so egregious that he has been sentenced by the court to live in one of his own decrepit tenements. Mr. Gardenia plays Big Lou, Kritski's world-class bigot of a father, while Mr. Blades plays Marlon, a street hustler-tenant who raises his rent money by beating the incarcerated landlord at three-card monte.
"The Super" is shooting in New York with the blessing of both the film unions and the movie's distributor, 20th Century Fox, because Mr. Gordon signed the last feature-film contract with a local of the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians, which merged with the International Alliance of Theater Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators last Oct. 1. Everyone in the movie industry refers to them as "Nabet" and "Iatse" or "I.A."
 Currently the contracts between Local 52 of the International Alliance and the major Hollywood film producers have expired, and the producers have promised to steer films away from New York City until an agreement is reached. The union has said it will work in good faith with producers until a new contract can be agreed upon, as it has done many times before when contracts have expired.
Until agreement is reached, five major producers have declared what amounts to a boycott on film making in New York. The five are Columbia Pictures, the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation, Paramount Pictures, Warner Brothers, MGM-United Artists and Orion Pictures, which participates as a distributor.
Only two big-budget feature films are currently shooting in New York City: "The Super" and Woody Allen's new, untitled film, which started production Nov. 19; it will be distributed by Orion. Several television productions, covered under different union contracts, are also shooting.
 
City's Third-Largest Industry
 According to Patrick Pleven, an assistant director of the Mayor's Office for Film, Theater and Broadcasting, it is hard to tell whether the dearth of film making simply reflects the conditions of New York's normal slow season, or whether the boycott is taking effect. At stake is the employment of nearly 3,500 workers who toil on more than 100 New York film productions yearly as well as the future of the city's third-largest industry, behind tourism and fashion.
"I haven't heard of any specific films that have been turned away," said Mr. Pleven, "but at this time we would usually be hearing of a lot more films that would be in the pipeline. It seems peculiar to me that more projects are not on the drawing board."
Mr. Gordon, producer of "The Super," said he had every intention of shooting in New York again. "I haven't had any pressure placed on me about bringing future projects here," he said. One of his planned films, "The Gossip Columnist," "really has a New York feeling, to me," Mr. Gordon said. "I'd fight to shoot it here."
Still, it is not easy to film in New York City. "It's 15 percent more expensive," he said, estimating that the movie will cost between $15 million and $20 million by the time it is released in August. Aside from the premium pay to members of the International Alliance of Theater Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators during night and weekend shooting, "when we hire extras, they're all under SAG," he said, referring to the Screen Actors Guild. Less costly non-SAG actors can be hired in many non-New York locations.
In addition, "the traffic and congestion is terrible," he said. "You can waste three hours just getting to a new location across town, and that costs money."
 
No Other City Like It
 In the end, though, Mr. Gordon said shooting in New York "was worth the extra trouble."
"You come here for the look," he said. "The authenticity of that vertical orientation. The bleakness, the grayness. You can't get it anywhere else."
Rod Daniel, the film's director, agreed. "I insisted on New York," he said. " 'The Super' is a tightly balled, character-oriented, in-your-face comedy, and it was perfect for the city. There's a lot of energy in the air, a sense of danger and excitement. It's never boring. And that works its way right up onto the screen. We wanted to flaunt the film's New Yorkiness."
And, he added, there have been moments when New York was positively magical. One of them occurred when Mr. Pesci, Mr. Gardenia and Mr. Blades were standing on a grimy asphalt roof on 10th Street between Avenue A and First Avenue. To the north glowed the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building, and, only a few blocks away, the festive clock lights of the Consolidated Edison Company Building shone brightly.
The cameras began to roll; Mr. Daniel called "Action!" and Mr. Pesci began saying his lines to Mr. Gardenia, enacting a scene of rooftop confrontation between father and son. "It's my building, remember?" Mr. Pesci said angrily. "You gave it to me. I'm gonna run it the way I think it should be run!"
After Mr. Daniel said "Cut," Mr. Pesci talked about Kritski, the slumlord. "My character, he's the Archie Bunker of the 90's," said the actor, who says his name "PEH-shee," giving it "the good Veronese pronunciation," as he put it.
"Kritski abuses every minority in his sights," Mr. Pesci continued. "But he's honest, and that's what I like about him. I love to play a guy with passion. And I do like comedy. Lou Kritski is so obnoxious and absurd he's funny."
 
Good Timing of Background Noise
 Funny Kritski may be, but Mr. Pesci's movie tour of New York has not always been a laugh riot. "You always run into police sirens, and screeching ambulances," he said. "As soon as you hear the words 'roll sound,' 'speed,' and 'action' -- well, right on cue, some siren goes on."
Then there was the time Mr. Pesci was walking down Nostrand Avenue in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, preparing for a scene, when a man in the crowd nearby had his throat cut in an argument outside a methadone clinic. "I was walking past him just as he got his throat slit," Mr. Pesci said, "and the guy -- well, he was running around trying to hold his head on."
There have been other, less life-threatening difficulties. For example, the principal exteriors on East 11th Street were a bit too upscale for the look needed for Lou Kritski's slum building. Rather than relocate in a more rundown neighborhood, the director decided that the street should be "dressed down," as set designers say.
So, the community was enlisted in spray-painting on more graffiti; false fronts were constructed; windows were cinder-blocked; razor-wire accents were carefully placed, and the buildings were sprayed with a dirt-and-water mixture to enhance their grittiness. The block will be given a $50,000 restoration when the film making is done.
"I think it's a delight to shoot in New York, and I wish I could do it more often," said Mr. Gardenia, sitting meditatively during a moment between scenes. "After all, I live here." Mr. Gardenia has a house in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and is a landlord himself. "I have a tenant in the upstairs apartment," he said. "I'm a nice landlord. I am definitely not Big Lou."
"I've only been able to do three movies in New York," said Mr. Gardenia, naming "Death Wish," "Little Murders" and "Moonstruck." "It's a privilege to shoot here once in a while. I hope New York movies don't become an endangered species."

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
The Letter

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: MONTREAL

 BODY:
The most historic document of George Bush's Presidency is now in the pocket of his Secretary of State, who is en route to Geneva to deliver it personally to his Iraqi counterpart. It is the letter of final warning to Saddam Hussein.
The letter serves two purposes. First is to make certain that our position is transmitted without conditional shading by the Iraqi dictator's nervous underling. Second is to make plain that no new Yalta is in the works -- no secret assurance that gives the aggressor a way to claim a victory and marshal his forces for a day when he has his nuclear "equalizer." 
 The condition is already being offered by President Mitterrand of France: in essence, "swap Kuwait for Israel." France offers a deal linking a withdrawal from Kuwait to the same face-saver Saddam Hussein proposed after we called his bluff: a promise to try to force the Israelis to give up their security to Palestinian irredentists. Everyone knows that belated pitch is a phony: Saddam Hussein grabbed Kuwait for the money, not for the Palestinians.
The French fig leaf of linkage would guarantee the survival of the Saddam regime, justify the rape of Kuwait and invite other dictators to plunder their neighbors under cover of a jihad. Not even other Arab leaders want that; they know that a deal crowning the butcher of Baghdad with saviorhood would increase his momentum and whet his appetite.
That is why it is vital to define our mission in the gulf: not only to get Iraq to withdraw from what is left of Kuwait, our "stated" goal, but to remove the cancer of aggression before it metastasizes.
Mr. Bush remembers that shameful period of offering trade credits "to bring Iraq into the family of peaceful nations." He ruefully told the interviewer David Frost: "We had Congressmen that went over and came back and talked to me, and they said, wait a minute. . . ."
Waiting a few months led to Kuwait; waiting a few years would lead to nuclear blackmail. Mr. Bush now understands "the worse price to pay tomorrow" and can at last say with conviction that there has been "nothing of this moral importance since World War II." In that same interview, when Mr. Frost asked about "the final sanction" of massive air attack, the President did not join the chorus of mockers of this lower-casualty option: "Without trying to sound bellicose, he would not have air cover of any kind, should there be some conflagration. None, none at all. So, we have awesome air power there . . ."
In his letter, Mr. Bush should sound coldly bellicose. One hopes it will draw on his radio address last weekend and go something like this:
"Dear President Hussein: Withdraw from Kuwait unconditionally and totally before the U.N. January 15 deadline or condemn your nation to terrible consequences. No compromise will be offered; no linkage to any other subject will be tolerated; no oral representations by anyone can modify in any way the choice I put before you today: withdrawal or war.
"Total withdrawal by the deadline date," the letter ought to say, "will avert the world's massive military response to your aggression, but economic sanctions will continue, and the possibility of more forceful action will exist, until you (1) stop all development of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, and destroy such installations under world supervision, agreeing to on-site inspections and (2) make restitution for money and property stolen from Kuwait and its citizens and resident workers; pay reparations to families of those killed by your unprovoked aggression; make whole those countries impoverished by the influx of refugees; agree to turn over to an international tribunal those charged with war crimes."
A final paragraph is necessary to prevent this letter from becoming a device for delay. The good thing about a letter is its ability to demolish ambiguity; the danger is that it invites a reply asking for clarifications and amendations -- designed to prevent action until war would be costlier or the Mitterrand tactic prevailed.
"Signify your acceptance of these terms by withdrawing totally by the deadline date, and with a letter before that date agreeing to inspection, restitution, reparations, and cooperation in bringing to justice those guilty of war crimes. Failure to respond on time will be treated as your rejection of this final offer to spare your forces from destruction."
This letter should be neither an appeal to reason nor a plea for peace. It should be an unmistakable ultimatum. In Churchill's phrase, "The constabulary of the world is at hand"; the criminal must retreat.

HEADLINE: Let's Talk About Reparations for Slavery;
Sliced Too Fine

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Fine Distinctions for the White House" (editorial, Dec. 19), you suggest that the Bush Administration's effort to separate race-based scholarships paid for with Federal funds from those that are subsidized by other sources illustrates a politically successful, legally defensible and constitutionally appropriate way of making controversial policy choices.
Whatever the political expediency and legality of fudging scholarship support for minority students in this manner, to suggest that the finesse of an accountant can shield all Government policy choices ignores, at the least, the constraints of the First Amendment in other contexts.
Now pending in the United States Supreme Court, for example, is a case challenging the Bush Administration's attempt to employ the very shield you support in defense of a gag rule on professional speech. In Rust v. Sullivan (in which I am counsel of record for the petitioners), the Bush Administration seeks to draw a sharp division between Federal and private funds for domestic family planning. It is defending the censorship of abortion information, counseling and referral in Title X-funded family-planning clinics.
But as Anna Quindlen stated in "Banning the A-Word" (column, Nov. 1), this defense merely spits in the face of the law. Indeed, what she described as the Government's "demand that doctors like Irving Rust trade free speech and professional responsibility for scarce Federal funds" is not immunized from public condemnation or constitutional scrutiny because Dr. Rust remains theoretically free to give information about abortion to his low-income patients with non-Federal funds, outside the Federal Title X program.
Universities too, like not-for-profit health clinics, have to scramble to pool resources from both governmental and private donors in order to provide critical services and opportunities to economically disadvantaged communities. The razor blade approach to Federal policy reflected by the Administration's "compromise" on race-based college scholarships and endorsed by your editorial evidences a callous disregard for this reality, as well as for the power of the Government purse. In the free speech context, however, this approach fails completely to save Government censorship from crossing the constitutional line.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS TAKING OVER A GROUP OF BANKS TO HEAD OFF A RUN

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Acting to avert a run on one of the nation's largest banking companies, the Federal Government today seized the Bank of New England and two affiliated banks and said it would protect all depositors until the banks could be sold.
The rescue is likely to cost taxpayers at least $2.3 billion, making it one of the costliest bailouts in history. 
 On Friday, the Bank of New England Corporation, which is based in Boston, announced a large loss for the fourth quarter, which left it without reserves to absorb future losses. The other banks taken over today, also owned by the corporation, are the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company and the Maine National Bank.
 
Withdrawals by Depositors
 Government officials said the seizure was prompted by the withdrawal of more than $1 billion on Friday and Saturday at branches of the Bank of New England and Connecticut Bank and Trust. Officials of the parent company said less than $1 billion had been withdrawn.
"The management had already come to us and asked for some Government assistance," Robert L. Clarke, the Comptroller of the Currency, said in a telephone interview tonight. "We decided that the most positive thing we could do for the region was to get the situation stabilized."
The Bank of New England, the third-largest bank in the region and the 33d-largest in the nation, had been in growing distress as the New England real estate market worsened. Developers of office buildings, hotels, shopping malls and condominiums could not meet their loan payments.
"There were just too many bad loans," said Lawrence K. Fish, who became chairman of the Bank of New England Corporation in early 1990. "It was a classic lesson in the failure to diversify risk. The Bank of New England lent too much, too aggressively, too quickly for a number of years."
 
'Too Big to Fail'
 A far smaller bank owned by the Bank of New England Corporation, the Bank of New England Trust Company of West Palm Beach, Fla., was not taken over by the Government.
At a news conference here this evening, L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said the Government had decided over the weekend to inject $750 million immediately into two banks owned by Bank of New England.
Mr. Seidman said regulators had decided to protect all deposits, including those over $100,000, although the F.D.I.C. is not obliged to do so. That decision is a clear demonstration of the Government's "too big to fail" approach in dealing with large problem banks -- stepping in to avoid the ripple effect that the failure of a large bank would have throughout the economy.
"It was clear to us that to protect the stability of the system, we should protect all depositors," Mr. Seidman said. He said more than $2 billion on deposit at banks owned by Bank of New England, out of a total of $16.8 billion on deposit, was in accounts larger than $100,000.
Asked what had caused the Bank of New England's difficulties, Mr. Seidman said, "They made loans that could not be collected."
The Government's expense in dealing with the Bank of New England had been anticipated in the F.D.I.C.'s estimate that the its bank insurance fund would lose $4 billion in 1990. The fund is at the weakest level since its creation in 1934, and Mr. Seidman has estimated that it could lose another $5 billion in 1991 as the nation's banking problems worsen.
The Bank of New England's failure is the largest since the 1989 collapse of Mcorp, based in Dallas, and the 1988 collapse of the First Republicbank Corporation, also of Dallas. The Government has estimated that Mcorp's failure will ultimately cost taxpayers $2.5 billion and the failure of First Republic at least $1.6 billion, and possibly much more.
As in those cases, the Government created a "bridge" bank that it will control. The bridge bank will own the Bank of New England until it can be sold to a financially healthy institution.
Government officials tonight would not name the banking companies with which they are negotiating the sale of the Bank of New England. Mr. Seidman said he expected the Government would soon disclose the identities of two banks that are bidding. Both are believed to be financially strong domestic banking companies situated outside New England.
The BancOne Corporation, of Columbus, Ohio, which many banking experts had named as a possible buyer, has not yet talked to Federal regulators, its chairman, John B. McCoy, said today.
Mr. Seidman also said other bids might be made.
"Our greatest interest is having a buyer who has the ability to take these institutions and who pays us the best price," he said. In past large collapses, the acquiring bank has often received the right to return poor assets to the Government, adding substantially to the cost to the Government of the bailout.
Mr. Seidman said the banking company's management had agreed to stay on while a buyer was sought.
"This management was not the cause of the bank's failure, in our opinion," he said. "We have no evidence of any fraud at this time."
 
Risky Real Estate Loans
 While the weakening of the New England economy undoubtedly hurt the company, the last year has made clear that its most severe problems were the result of its own mistakes. It lent an astounding 36.7 percent of total loans for risky commercial real estate projects -- far more than neighboring banks -- and it failed to manage the activities of its subsidiary banks adequately to reduce operating costs.
When Mr. Fish and his management team were installed early last year, it was already too late.
Mr. Seidman estimated that the bank would eventually have to declare $3 billion to $6 billion of its $22 billion of assets worthless.
Of the $750 million made available, Mr. Seidman said about $500 million would be given to the Bank of New England and about $250 million to Connecticut Bank and Trust, based in Hartford. Maine National is based in Portland.
The decision to stand behind all deposits is a sharp contrast to the F.D.I.C.'s handling late last year of the collapse of the Freedom National Bank of New York, in Harlem, one of the nation's largest minority-owned institutions.
After Freedom National collapsed, regulators decided they would make good only 50 cents of each $1 for all accounts larger than $100,000. That decision was strongly criticized by some lawmakers and community officials.
 
Bank Proposal Rejected
 In creating a Government-owned bank, regulators rejected a proposal by the Bank of New England's bondholders to provide the company another $706 million of capital by converting bonds into stock, plus another $100 million of new equity capital from the sale of securities to bondholders and stockholders in the company.
"I think our plan would have been the least costly for the F.D.I.C., but they decided that they did not have the luxury of time to consider it," said Wilbur L. Ross, Jr., a managing director at Rothschild Inc., which is representing a group of bondholders.
One banking official who insisted on anonymity said the creation of Goverment-owned banks to replace the Bank of New England units creates even more pressure on the Government to find a new buyer quickly.
"With a Government-owned bridge bank, you have a situation where loans are not being made, officers are busy looking for new jobs and the franchise value is evaporating daily," the official said.
"I'm not surprised they protected every dollar at the Bank of New England," said Bert Ely, a banking and savings industry consultant. "Markets are too nervous right now about banks. There are too many uncertainties out there right now."
Problems in the New England economy, and particularly its real estate markets, have in recent months led to growing problems at many regional banks and savings associations. Last week the Governor of Rhode Island shut down 45 credit unions and banks that had been insured by a private insurer that said it might not be solvent.
Twelve of the credit unions are expected to reopen Monday with Federal insurance. The others remain closed, with considerable uncertainty as to whether their customers will receive 100 cents for each dollar deposited.
Federal officials have been eager to keep the problems at the Bank of New England from spreading to other banking companies in the region. Some of them have also suffered losses from bad real estate loans, but are not in such dire straits as the Bank of New England.
If the F.D.I.C. had insisted that large uninsured depositors bear part of the cost of the bank's problems, large depositors might quickly withdraw money from other banks in New England, including the Bank of Boston, the Shawmut Bank and Fleet/Norstar Financial Group.
Mr. Seidman said that today's decision did not establish a precedent for other problem banks in the region that might require Federal assistance.
"They will be handled on a case-by-case basis," he said.
Because the Bank of New England has such a high level of delinquent loans, analysts assume that any potential buyer would not want to buy all $17 billion of loans outstanding. On Friday, the Bank of New England Corporation said it had $3.3 billion of assets -- primarily loans -- that were not earning interest or were so troubled that the bank did not expect payment on time.
 
Strong Buyer Needed
 No large bank has ever survived as an independent company with such a large amount of its loans failing to pay interest.
Some analysts say the bank's $17 billion in loans could be worth only 75 cents on the dollar. A buyer would be loath to acquire the bad loans, and history shows that borrowers who are financially squeezed feel less obligation to repay a debt owed the F.D.I.C. than a debt owed to a bank with which they might want to do business in the future.
In talks about the acquisition of the Bank of New England, Government regulators have made it clear that the acquiring banking company must have above-average financial strength, so that it would make the necessary investment in the Bank of New England and still have capital equal to about 5 percent of its assets.
But even with a new bank investing perhaps several hundred million dollrs in the Bank of New England, the F.D.I.C. would experience a major loss, primarily from the need to take the Bank of New England's bad loans, which no buyer would accept.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 8, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about the Government's seizure of the Bank of New England misstated the source of the $2.3 billion that is the expected cost of bailing out the institution and two affiliated banks. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's bank insurance fund, which is financed by banks themselves, will be responsible for the cost; it will not be covered by taxpayer funds.

HEADLINE: With a New Hybrid Government, Weicker Is Facing a Budget Crisis

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 6

 BODY:
An unfamiliar hybrid form of state government is shaping up here, charged with the job, beginning this week, of addressing a budget crisis that is equally unfamiliar in its severity. At the center ring in both cases is Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
Mr. Weicker, a former Republican United States Senator, was elected Governor in November as an independent -- only the fifth independent governor in the United States since the turn of the century. On Wednesday he will take command in the face of a worsening economy and a budget with deficits that have grown deeper since the election. Projected sales-tax revenues and corporate tax collections have been dropping every month, with no end in sight. 
 Against such a backdrop -- and with Mr. Weicker maintaining an almost monk-like silence about his plans -- his appointments and nominations for administration posts, drawn from three parties, have fallen from the sky like pieces of an unfinished jigsaw puzzle.
Lawmakers, other state officials and news reporters comb off-the-cuff comments by Mr. Weicker and his aides for hidden meaning, especially for clues to whether he will decide that the state should tax the wages of its workers. Connecticut is one of only 10 states that does not tax earned income.
"Every action, every statement, will be watched and interpreted over and over again," said Jonathan Pelto, the political director of the state's Democratic Party, which controls both chambers of the General Assembly.
Mr. Weicker's nominees to head state agencies are subject to approval by the General Assembly. If all the Governor's choices made so far are approved, Democrats, Republicans and members of Mr. Weicker's fledgling third party, called the Connecticut Party, will be sprinkled across the executive branch in what Mr. Weicker insists is complete disregard for the two-party rules of the past.
He is impatient with those who have not grasped the implications of the new political era in Hartford. He bristles when asked the party association of his nominees and appointees. He argues that politicians and reporters who persist in using what he calls archaic standards to assess his administration are missing the point.
He has declined to be interviewed about his inauguration or his plans and hopes for his administration. When a reporter assigned to write a profile of the Governor-elect approached him after a recent news conference at the Capitol and asked how him how he would describe his management style, Mr. Weicker refused to give a direct reply.
 
'Enough Speculation'
 "I'm not going to describe it," he said. "You guys have done enough speculation, so from now on I think I'll just do it. Then you can report after I've done it, rather than speculate on what can or can't be done."
What Mr. Weicker has done so far is to name a Democrat, William J. Cibes Jr. to head the budget arm of the state government, the Office of Policy and Management. It has been run by Democrats for the last 15 years.
Social-service agencies that supervise the welfare system -- the largest spending category in the $7 billion budget -- would also continue to be led by Democrats.
In contrast, the Department of Economic Development, which seeks to bolster Connecticut's business climate, would be led by a Republican. And control over the Department of Banking would go to a friend from Mr. Weicker's days at Yale University, Henry S. Scherer Jr., whose party affiliations are no help at all in assembling the puzzle. Mr. Scherer has been both a Republican and a Democrat over the years.
Presiding over the State Senate will be a member of Mr. Weicker's Connecticut Party, Lieut. Gov.-elect Eunice S. Groark, a former Republican from Hartford.
 
Former Opponents Appointed
 Of the 10 people Mr. Weicker has nominated to cabinet-level positions, four are vanquished political opponents, including two Republicans and one Democrat who were early candidates for governor last year. Mr. Weicker chose another Democrat, Gloria Schaffer, who challenged him for his Senate seat in 1976, to be Commissioner of Consumer Protection.
The Governor's private staff, which is not subject to legislative approval, is made up mostly of Republicans.
The director of Mr. Weicker's transition team, Peter W. Gold, has said the common denominator of the evolving administration is managerial excellence. No attempt is being made to have a perfect balance of Democrats or Republicans, but neither is such a balance being avoided, Mr. Gold said. He and other staff members say that when Mr. Weicker interviews a prospective manager, he does not even inquire about party affiliation.
 
Record as a Maverick
 All of which leads many of those trying to track Mr. Weicker's real direction to the question of his personality. At 6 feet 6 inches, 59-year-old Mr. Weicker is physically imposing. He has an air of authority -- some call it arrogance -- that can make him seem even larger, especially when one considers his history as a Senate maverick who flouted party lines and left a trail of gored oxen in Washington for nearly two decades.
Invited once to testify before the Republican National Committee about what its national platform should be, Senator Weicker, then a Republican, took the stand and announced that having a platform at all was foolishness because no one cared about or ever read such documents. He then sat down.
In November Mr. Weicker discomfited both the Democrats and Republicans with his third-party campaign. He defeated the Republican nominee, John G. Rowland, by about 33,000 votes, and the Democrat, Bruce A. Morrison, by more than 230,000.
As Governor, Mr. Weicker's personal power will be magnified, politicians say, by the fact that his administration will have no party cohesion to bind its members, who may find they have little in common beyond owing their jobs to the boss. Those who have worked for Mr. Weicker say he has always been an exacting, hands-on manager who knows precisely the way he wants things done.
 
Doing Things 'His Way'
 "He wants it done right: his way," said Hank Harper, who ran Senator Weicker's Connecticut offices from 1971 until his retirement in 1989. "If you can understand that, then he's not a difficult man to work for. If you can't appreciate that, I can imagine somebody would have a lot of trouble."
In government and out, much of the speculation and anxiety about what Mr. Weicker will or will not do concerns Connecticut's troubled budget, especially whether he will propose or accept a state income tax on wages in the legislative session that begins on Wednesday. The state already taxes so-called unearned income -- stock and bond dividends and interest.
The most recent Comptroller's office report projects a $670 million gap for the year ending June 30 and a $1.5 billion shortfall in the year after that in a budget of just over $7 billion. Unemployment edged to 5.2 percent in November, compared with 4.1 percent a year ago.
Mr. Weicker has said that he does not want to borrow money to bridge the deficit and that imposing a new wage tax during an economic downturn could make the downturn worse. But his nominee for Budget Director, Mr. Cibes, openly favors an income tax and ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic Party's nomination as governor last year on just such a platform. Mr. Cibes has said that all such decisions now rest with Mr. Weicker.
How Mr. Weicker makes up his mind on an issue depends on the question at hand, past and present staff members say -- a characteristic that once again sheds only limited light on his administration's possible course.
"He'd listen to both supportive views and dissenting opinions, then make up his own mind," said Richard F. Benson, who was director of Senator Weicker's Hartford office from 1977 until last year, when the office closed after Mr. Weicker's 1988 re-election defeat to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat.
"Very rarely would he just announce, 'Here's the deal, here's how I'm going to vote,' " Mr. Benson said. "Except for some things, where he was just going headstrong into it and that was it."

HEADLINE: Bernard Hellring Is Dead at 74; Battled to Improve Varied Laws

BYLINE: By PETER B. FLINT

 BODY:
Bernard Hellring, a leader in efforts to simplify and standardize state and national laws, particularly in business affairs, legislative apportionment and divorce, died on Friday in Orange, N.J. He was 74 years old and lived in South Orange, N.J.
He died of a heart attack on his way to visit a client, a family spokesman said. 
 Mr. Hellring, a dedicated fighter for right as he saw it, was, for more than 30 years, a New Jersey Commissioner on Uniform State Laws. He helped draft many model statutes in business transactions, trial practices, labor relations and estates, for the state and also for the nation, in conferences with counterparts from other states.
He also led efforts to change New Jersey divorce laws and codify them in the state's so-called no-fault divorce law of 1971, and he helped chart the 1985 Congressional re-apportionment of the state. He was the founder and senior partner of a leading Newark law firm, now called Hellring Lindeman Goldstein & Siegal.
 Bernard Hellring was the son of an Austrian merchant whose family brought him to this country at the age of 3. He grew up in Newark, attended public schools there and earned a bachelor's degree at Lafayette College.
He earned a law degree at Harvard University in 1939 and was later a member of the board of overseers for the university's law school, a president of the Harvard Law School Association of New Jersey and a national vice chairman of the law school's scholarship committee.
In World War II, he served in the Washington Office of Scientific Research and Development. He was later a longtime adviser to the American Law Institute and special counsel to the New Jersey Commissioner of Conservation and Economic Development.
Surviving are his wife of 42 years, the former Sally Horner; two daughters who are both lawyers, Margaret, of South Orange, and Heidi, of Millburn, N.J., and four grandchildren.

Buick Rebate Plan

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., Jan. 7

 BODY:
The Buick division of the General Motors Corporation extended customer rebates for most 1990 and 1991 Buick models through April 7. The rebates, which range from $250 to $2,000, had been set to expire today. Buick said it had changed the existing rebate schedule by lowering the rebate on its Reatta personal-luxury car to $2,000, from $3,000, and by raising interest rates by a percentage point on most G.M.A.C. financing plans. The rebates cover all models except the Park Avenue, Park Avenue Ultra and Estate Wagon.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold and Silver Prices Jump As Commodity Funds Buy

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The futures prices of gold and silver soared yesterday amid heightened fear of a war in the Persian Gulf. But dealers stressed that the price rises were more reflective of buying by commodity futures funds than of significant demand for the actual metal.
At the close of trading on the Commodity Exchange in New York, the largest gold and silver futures market, the nearest active delivery contract, for February, was settled at $396.20 an ounce, up $9 on the day. Dealers quoted a cash price for gold of $394.10, up $9.20 an ounce. 
 The active March Comex silver delivery jumped 13.3 cents an ounce, to $4.34. Dealers quoted a cash silver price of $4.288 an ounce, up 13.3 cents.
At the New York Mercantile Exchange, the spot platinum delivery contract, for January, rose $4.20 an ounce, to $413.90. The far more active April contract was up $2.70, to $417.10.
 
'Expect Increased Volatility'
 "As the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for Iraq to quit Kuwait draws near, we can expect increased volatility in all markets," said William B. O'Neill, senior strategist at Merrill Lynch Futures. "But in order for a sustained advance in the precious metals to occur, there has to be a significant increase in the demand for physical metal. We have not seen any significant demand in physical bullion of late."
Mr. O'Neill said much of the strength in silver was a result of the buying of futures contracts by commodity funds. The funds were somewhat less aggressive in buying gold futures. "And every time the precious metals rally, for whatever reason, the producers consistently sell into the rallies," Mr. O'Neill said.
The relative lack of demand for actual gold and silver bullion also comes at a time when many investors are avoiding the battered stock market and when interest rates on other investments are declining. The fact that gold is now trading at the levels that prevailed when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 has not been lost on investors. Silver is selling well below its level of Aug. 2.
 
Platinum Prices Lag
 While the Persian Gulf crisis roils the gold and silver market, the price of platinum, a far rarer metal, has lagged. One reason, oddly, is that the same rise in oil prices that buoys gold has a mostly negative impact on platinum. As oil prices rise, demand tends to decline, along with the use of platinum by refiners.
One of platinum's main uses is as a catalyst in the refining of crude oil into heating oils and gasoline. Platinum is also used as a catalyst to upgrade the octanes of gasoline and other fuels.
Also, increases in energy prices hurt the economy and reuce demand for cars and trucks. Platinum is widely used in catalytic converters, the anti-pollution devices required on automobiles in the United States and a number of other countries.

HEADLINE: '90 Diamond Sales Up 2%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Sales of rough uncut diamonds rose 2 percent last year, to $4.17 billion, from $4.09 billion in 1989, the De Beers diamond cartel reported today.
De Beers's marketing arm, the Central Selling Organization, called 1990 "a year of consolidation" and called the sales satisfactory. But when adjusted for inflation, which ran at about a 6 percent annual rate in the United States and higher in some other leading consumer nations, diamond sales fell.
Sales dropped 32 percent in the second half of the year from the robust first half because of the international economic climate and the Persian Gulf crisis, the organization said.
Officials for what is formally known as De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. said the outlook was uncertain because of the continuing Middle East turmoil, which has undermined consumer confidence by pushing oil prices, and thus inflation, higher.
In 1989, sales fell 2 percent, after gains of 35 percent in 1988 and 19 percent in 1987.
The Central Selling Organization markets 80 percent of the world's diaproduction, about 100 million carats a year.

HEADLINE: Military's Role Raises U.S. Hopes for Better Ties

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
United States officials praised the Haitian Army yesterday for blocking a coup attempt by a supporter of the former Duvalier dictatorship, saying its defense of the civilian Government would bolster American efforts to improve ties with Haiti's military.
A senior Administration official said Roger Lafontant, leader of the feared Tontons Macoute militia under Duvalier rule, had miscalculated in thinking that the army would support his bid to take power and thus prevent the inauguration on Feb. 7 of the President-elect, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
 Father Aristide was elected on Dec. 16 on a platform promising sweeping economic and social change, rankling some army officers and other members of the traditional Haitian elite.
When Dr. Lafontant's forces seized the National Palace and took the Provisional President, Ertha Pascal-Trouillot, hostage early yesterday, the army commander, Gen. Herard Abraham, appeared on the national television to denounce the coup attempt.
 
General 'the Unsung Hero'
 General Abraham pledged that he would defend the Constitution, and army troops stormed the palace to arrest Dr. Lafontant, a former Interior Minister, and several other plotters.
A senior American official said Mr. Lafontant's strategy "was based on a delusion."
"He was operating like this was Haiti 5 or 10 years ago," the official said. "General Abraham is the unsung hero. His action cemented a bond between Aristide and the army. This leaves no doubt that the army is loyal to the electoral process."
The official said American and Venezuelan diplomats telephoned General Abraham and other officers pledging their support for the civilian Government and urging them to intervene to defend Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot. But he said the army did not need convincing.
Before yesterday's action, the army had shown an ambivalent attitude toward Dr. Lafontant. Officers backed a decision by the National Electoral Commission to disqualify his candidacy in the last presidential election, but they would not act on a warrant for his arrest even when he vowed that Father Aristide would never take power.
 
Americans as Mediators
 The official said the coup attempt could prove to be a blessing for Father Aristide by exposing and removing his main enemy. Now that the army has taken Dr. Lafontant prisoner, his Tontons Macoute, the militia that long terrorized the population in defense of the Duvalier family dictatorship, is thought to lack a central leader.
For the last several months, Bernard W. Aronson, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs; Alvin P. Adams Jr., the United States Ambassador to Haiti, and Pentagon officials in Port-au-Prince have tried to convince the military that its defense of the electoral process was in its own interests. Serving as informal mediators, Mr. Aronson and Mr. Adams called a meeting with Father Aristide only hours after his Dec. 16 election victory to urge that he work with the military and private sector.
At that meeting, Father Aristide pledged to moderate his polemics and seek reconciliation with the military. As a proponent of liberation theology, Father Aristide has advocated justice for victims of the 29-year Duvalier dictatorship, a restructuring of the economy to benefit the poor, and a struggle to root out corruption.
 
Increased Aid Studied
 Since the December election, Defense and State Department officials have begun to study ways to increase aid to Haiti, now about $50 million a year. After three years of granting virtually no aid to the military, the Pentagon is considering sending the Haitian Army medical supplies and giving it advice and financing for a civic action program of bridge and road building.
Last year, Congress blocked an Administration proposal to send the army $500,000 in medical and other nonweapons aid based on an assessment that the army was a force halting democracy. The senior official said yesterday's action might help convince Congress that the army merited help.
The White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said yesterday, "We applaud the efforts of the Haitian military and police authorities in restoring the legitimate authority in Haiti,"
Robert I. Rotberg, president of Lafayette College and an expert on Haiti, said of the failed coup: "This is an extraordinarily encouraging development. This is the first time in Haiti's dark and checkered history when the army has intervened to put democracy on its rightful track. The U.S. and the military seem to be cooperating in order to do what is right for Haiti."

HEADLINE: 'Recyclable' Claims Are Debated

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Alarmed by the spread of state laws regulating the use of environmental claims like "recyclable," many large consumer products companies are seeking national standards.
The companies, some of which have already had to alter such claims, particularly want a rule that enables them to assert that their products can be recycled, even if recycling operations do not exist. Environmental groups, which say such assertions are misleading in the absence of actual recycling, are expected to oppose such a rule. 
 Officials from many states, as well as environmental groups, are also calling for Federal action on environmental claims, although they are likely to seek tougher standards than the manufacturers.
 
Washington May Be Easier
 The companies may expect a more sympathetic hearing from Federal regulators than from state officials. While some states have enacted laws containing specific requirements for using terms like "recycled," an official of the Federal Trade Commission said the agency was likely to favor more general guidelines.
Barry Cutler, the director of the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection, described the industry action as "an important first step" in reaching agreement on the claims. He said the agency was unlikely to pass "a hard and fast rule" defining each term but might issue general guidelines for how each is used.
At issue is whether manufacturers can seek a marketing advantage for their products by labeling them as "recycled" or "degradable" and what the standards should be for using those terms. The Mobil Corporation was sued by seven states last year for saying that its Hefty trash bags were degradable.
The states charged that the claim was false advertising because the chemical additive in the bags was active only in sunlight and most of the discarded bags are buried in landfills. The company agreed to drop the term, but is still contesting fines.
To prevent consumer confusion, four states, including New York, recent enacted laws on the use of environmentally related terms. For example, Rhode Island's law, the first to go into effect, allows a product to be labeled "recyclable" only if there are collection systems and processing plants available to 75 percent of the population.
In practice, that would mean only aluminum cans and plastic soda bottles could carry the label in most states, said Victor A. Bell, director of Rhode Island's Office of Environmental Coordination.
 
National Guidelines Sought
 Last March, the National Association of Attorneys General called on the F.T.C. and the Environmental Protection Agency to "develop uniform national guidelines" for environmental claims. More recently, a group of 10 state attorneys general who investigated environmental marketing practices called for the Federal Government to "enact a comprehensive regulatory scheme" for these practices.
Manufacturers have increasingly sought to use assertions of environmental friendliness to gain a competitive advantage with concerned consumers. Three-quarters of consumers surveyed last June by Gerstman & Meyers, a package design firm, said they would pay as much as 5 percent more for products with an environmental advantage.
 
Shift by Heinz
 Last year, when the H. J. Heinz Company announced that it would change the composition of its flexible ketchup bottle, it printed the term "recyclable" prominently on the label of prototype bottles. Since then the company has pulled back to review the use of that term.
"The word recyclable will not be on the front label" when the new bottle arrives on grocers' shelves in April, a spokesman said. Instead, a more complex label on the back will explain that the bottle can be recycled with large soda bottles made of the same plastic material.
In addition to New York and Rhode Island, New Hampshire and California have adopted regulations governing the use of environmental claims. Although all are similar, each has differences in detail, which could pose serious problems for companies that market products nationwide. For example, California requires that products labeled "recycled" must contain at least 10 percent by weight of material recovered from trash; New York specifies different minimums for different products.
As a result, a group 24 companies and trade associations, including Procter & Gamble, Kraft Foods, the National Retail Federation and the National Food Processors Association, have been working for the last few months to draft guidelines for the use of the terms "recyclable," "compostable," "refillable and re-usable," and "recycled." They may also include "degradable."
 
F.T.C. Action Sought
 The group plans to submit the proposed rules to the F.T.C. later this month in the hope that the agency will adopt them as a national standard. If the agency does so, the rules would not necessarily pre-empt state laws, but the manufacturers think Federal leadership will discourage states from proceeding independently.
"The common goal of the task force is uniform national guidelines," said Glenn Gamber, who is director of program management at the food processors association. He said the group also wants to "take the steam out of the urge of individual states to regulate these terms."
Mr. Gamber said the most contentious issue was likely to be the use of the word "recyclable." Because virtually everything is recyclable in a laboratory setting, many environmentalists have objected to the use of the claim for materials not being recycled in commercial quantities.
The Consumer Affairs Office in New York City charged the makers of drink boxes with false advertising for saying that the packages are as easy to recycle as a newspaper. The city and the manufacturers are negotiating a settlement. Although the drink boxes are being recycled in small demonstration projects, none are available to city residents.
 
'An Education Value'
 Mr. Gamber said the industry view is that telling customers that a package or product can be recycled "has an education value" that may spur the development of municipal or privately owned recycling operations.
But Allen Hershkowitz, a solid-waste expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, "The earth does not benefit from symbolic gestures." Unless a product is actually being recycled, he said, it becomes part of the solid-waste problem regardless of the words printed on it.
There has been growing pressure from environmental groups, industry and different levels of government to bring some uniformity to what has become known as "green marketing."
A recent report by the group of 10 state attorneys general said that environmental claims should be as specific as possible and refer only to disposal options currently available. "Unfortunately," the report added, "attempts to take advantage of consumer interest in the environment have led to a growing number of environmental claims that are trivial, confusing or even misleading."
 
Ruling on 'Reusable' Label
 Under New York's rules, a product or package can be labeled "re-usable" only if it can be re-used a minimum of five times. The "recycled" label can be used only if the package contains materials that had previously been used by consumers, and the percentage of recycled material must be displayed.
Mr. Gamber said the industry group favors environmental messages more complete than a single word or symbol. "Our materials use statements like 'recyclable in communities where facilities exist,' or 'this package contains 25 percent recycled fiber,' " Mr. Gamber said. "We do not like the naked use of words."
Mr. Gamber said that forcing companies to comply with a patchwork of local labeling laws would destroy economies of scale and lead to higher prices. Mr. Bell said he expected that states would follow the F.T.C.'s leadership if the agency issued guidelines on environmental claims. "We would be happy to go along," he said. "It does not make sense to have 50 different regulations."

Fear on Wall Street toppled stock prices yesterday and brought the decline in the Dow Jones industrial average in just the first four trading days of this year to an ominous 111 points, or 4.2 percent.
Yesterday alone the blue-chip average -- representing the nest egg of millions of investors either directly or through pension funds -- tumbled 43.32 points, to 2,522.77. 
 Although activity remained sluggish, the market's weakness spread to 1,219, or 60 percent, of the 2,001 Big Board stocks traded yesterday.
Computer-activated program selling accounted for a third of the loss, Birinyi Associates said.
Crude oil prices, which had finally seemed to be on the way down in response to what seemed like signs of peace only a few days ago, soared an astounding $2.75 a barrel, to $27.65.
Gold prices, always sensitive to trouble, shot ahead more than $9 an ounce, to $394.10, lifting gold shares sharply.
Bank stocks, badly shaken by the Government takeover of the Bank of New England, almost universally lost ground, several by $1 or more, as investors worried which bank would be the next to make unwelcome news.
While the nation's financial woes seemed the biggest fear, the crisis in the Persian Gulf never seemed more important than now.
Picking up an Associated Press dispatch from Nicosia, Cyprus, a Dow Jones news ticker headline said, "P.L.O. rejects Shamir offer for peace talks."
From Phoenix, Reuters quoted Vice President Dan Quayle as telling farmers that if force was used, it would be "quick, massive and decisive."
Michael Metz, chief market analyst for the investment house of Oppenheimer & Company, said, "You had a combination of fear that interest rates would go higher because the Fed has run its course in easing monetary policy and fears of further banking stress dramatized by the forced reorganization of the Bank of New England, all of which was compounded by fears that the outbreak of hostilities was imminent."
He specifically mentioned the P.L.O. report and referred to what he called the "extremely bellicose" speech on Sunday by Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein.
Noting that the market was down on "very low" volume, the Oppenheimer executive said he considered this "an ominous indication of the unwillingness of investors to commit funds even at these bargain levels."
One trader said he had advised a number of important clients to wait a while before moving into the market in the expectation that it would continue dropping.
Short-sellers, who sell borrowed stock and hope to replace it later with shares bought for less, were big participants yesterday in many of the big-capitalization issues, from Schlumberger and Disney to I.B.M. and many of the drug stocks, like American Home Products and Eli Lilly.
American Home slumped 1 5/8, to 47 3/4; Lilly 2, to 69 1/4; Johnson & Johnson 2 1/8, to 66 5/8, and Merck 2 1/4, to 83. Among those dropping $1 or more were Forest Lab, SmithKline, Syntex, Upjohn, Warner-Lambert, Cyanamid, Bristol-Myers, Marion Merrill, Medtronic, Millipore and Schering-Plough.
Merrill Lynch prompted a selloff in the group last week after saying that investors were holding too much.
In spite of widespread front-page treatment of the Bank of New England's troubles, trading in banking stocks was not heavy enough to make the top 10 active list of either the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, which runs the over-the-counter market.
But Wells Fargo fell 1 3/4, to 54; Manufacturers Hanover 1 1/8, to 20 1/8; Bankers Trust 1 1/4, to 42 3/4; U.S. Bancorp 1 1/8, to 19 3/8; Bankamerica 7/8, to 25 1/8 and J.P. Morgan 5/8, to 42 1/4. On Nasdaq, Banks of Iowa fell 3 3/4, to 67 1/2, and Trustco Bank 2 1/2, to 28 1/4.
Nervous traders moved into the market from the opening bell, pushing the Dow down close to 30 points in the first few minutes. The Dow then began building until about 11 A.M., when a steady flow of discouraging news coupled with the steady upturn in the price of crude sent the market heading back downward.
In top spot among the Big Board actives was Student Loan Marketing, a federally chartered company that buys such loans from banks. It slid 2 3/8, to 45 3/4, on 1.97 million shares after The New York Times said the Government was considering student-loan changes to reduce the role of banks. Fannie Mae fell 1 3/8, to 33 1/4, and Freddie Mac 1 7/8, to 47 1/8. Both are quasi-governmental agencies.
Among the gold issues, Newmont Mining rose 3 1/2, to 41 3/4; Newmont Gold 3 1/2, to 42 3/8; ASA Ltd. 2 5/8, to 47 3/8; Battle Mountain 1 1/8, to 8, and Homestake Mining 1 1/8, to 18 7/8.

HEADLINE: Czechoslovakia Gets $1.8 Billion I.M.F. Loan

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund announced a $1.8 billion loan to Czechoslovakia today, its biggest loan yet to one of the new democracies in Eastern Europe, to support its radical overhaul from Communism into a market economy.
Part of the loan is also intended to help Czechoslovakia deal with changes that the Soviet Union has just put into effect in its financial relations with former satellites in which the oil they buy must now be paid for with hard currency at world prices. 
 Formerly they acquired the oil atsubsidized prices in return for bartered goods. The change is expected nearly to triple what Czechoslovaks pay for their oil.
 
A Seal of Approval
 The I.M.F. has made the money available less than four months after Czechoslovakia rejoined the 155-nation lending agency and the World Bank, its sister organization. It had been an early member of the 45-year-old organization but was asked to leave during the cold war in 1954.
The loan is important not only because of its size but also because it represents an international seal of approval of a country's economic policies, which thus unlocks loans from other organizations.
Hundreds of millions of additional dollars are expected now to flow to Czechoslovakia from the European Community and the World Bank.
The I.M.F. makes loans to help countries balance their accounts with other nations and to finance essential imports. The World Bank makes longer term loans, usually 10 to 15 years, for specific projects such as dams and port facilities, and also to strengthen a country's economic sectors.
The bank is currently negotiating with Czechoslovakia for loans to improve banking and telecommunications and to help it speed the process of selling off state-owned industry.
Poland and Hungary, older members of the I.M.F., have already qualified for both I.M.F. and World Bank loans. Bulgaria, which joined the I.M.F. at the same time as Czechoslovakia, is still negotiating for its first loan.
The Czechoslovak economic changes borrow heavily from those begun in Poland a year ago. Poland borrowed $780 million from the I.M.F. last February, and Hungary $228 million last March.
Czechoslovakia's economic program, worked out with the I.M.F., includes removing price controls on 85 percent of goods sold, closing inefficent state-owned enterprises, establishing commercial banks and making the Czechoslovak crown convertible.

HEADLINE: THE CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasuries Drop Sharply

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
A big jump in the price of oil and other commodities -- a byproduct of a weekend of growing tensions over the Middle East -- hurt the credit markets yesterday, as prices of Treasury securities fell sharply and interest rates rose.
The decline, the second in succession, left bond yields more than 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, above their level late Thursday. 
 Developments in the Persian Gulf crisis provided clear excuses to sell securities. But traders said auctions today and tomorrow, when the Treasury will sell around $15 billion of new medium- and long-term securities, were also a big factor. With the threat of war building, dealers said interest rates needed to move higher for the new issues to be sold successfully.
 
Fear of Inflation
 If war breaks out, market participants said, they expect oil prices to skyrocket and intensify inflation fears. Rising inflation, or the mere threat of it, is anathema to fixed-income investors because it erodes the value of their securities.
"The big part of this downtrade has to do with the supply," one government-bond trader said. "That fact is being masked by the other news."
Still, the fast-approaching Jan. 15 deadline for Saddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait took its toll.
"If you knew how the situation would be resolved, you would be buying most fixed-income assets because the economic fundamentals are so bad," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "But right now, the markets are dealing in a kind of uncertainty they are not used to."
War fears and the coming new supply of long-term securities pushed up bond yields, but short-term interest rates were steady, helped by the Federal takeover of the Bank of New England as well as the continued prospect of a further easing in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve.
 
Big Demand for Bills
 Investor reaction to the Bank of New England move and the unsettled Middle East situation was easily seen in the results of yesterday's weekly auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills, analysts said. Non-competitive bids, a good proxy of demand from small investors, were a record $1.9 billion for the $10 billion worth of three-month bills sold. While not a record, non-competitive bids for the six-month bills were heavy, at $1.4 billion.
At the auction, three-month bills sold at an average discount rate of 6.52 percent, unchanged from a week earlier. Bids on the six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 6.51 percent, up slightly from 6.48 percent last week.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered late yesterday at a price of 104 25/32, down more than 1 1/4 points, or more than $12.50 for each $1,000 face amount, to yield 8.31 percent. It was the largest one-day decline for the issue in three months. At the end of Friday's sell-off, the closely watched issue was offered at a price to yield 8.20 percent.
The drop in Treasury note prices was not so severe. By late in the day, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 18/32, down 19/32, to yield 8.11 percent. But prices of the 7 1/4 percent two-year notes dipped by just 1/ 32, to 100 1/8, to yield 7.18 percent.
 
Higher Yields Seen
 Despite the big upward movement in long-term yields over the last two days, analysts said that yields might have to move higher in order to insure that the auction of nearly $7 billion worth of 30-year and 39 1/4-year bonds for the Resolution Funding Corporation goes well.
"We are starting to build in a war premium and a supply premium," said Peter Bass, managing director at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc., "but I don't think it is all there yet."
Late yesterday the 30-year Refcorp bonds to be sold today were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.59 percent.
Tomorrow the Treasury is expected sell $8.5 billion of new seven-year notes. Those securities were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 8.02 percent.
 
Heavy Corporate Borrowing
 Issuance of new corporate debt remained heavy yesterday, as companies fearing an outbreak of war came to market to price new securities.
Among the issuers was the General Electric Credit Corporation, which priced $250 million of four-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Kidder, Peabody & Company.
The 8 1/4 percent notes, which mature Jan. 15, 1995, were priced at $99.24 to yield 8.273 percent, 66.50 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 5/8 percent four-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for corporate bonds, dealers said that accounts wishing to sell outstanding bonds of a number of New England banks, including Hartford National and the Bank of Boston, found few buyers.
"Quoted bids on those banks are down about 10 points" from Friday, one corporate trader said, "but I don't know of any trades that were made. A lot was offered, but there were no real bids."
With the sharp drop in Treasury prices, most corporate bond prices fell by about 3/4 of a point, dealers said.
Activity in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds was quite light, market participants said. Prices of most widely quoted issues slipped by about 1/4 point.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.352	96.709	Discounted Rate	6.52%	6.51%	Coupon Yield	6.72%	6.82%	High Price	98.357	96.714	Discounted Rate	6.50%	6.50%	Coupon Yield	6.70%	6.81%	Low Price	98.349	96.704	Discounted Rate	6.53%	6.52%	Coupon Yield	6.73%	6.84%	Accepted at low price	60%	53%	Total applied for	$28,222,350	$29,204,630	Accepted	$10,032,550	$10,011,890	N.Y. applied for	$25,414,090	$25,996,340	N.Y. accepted	$7,920,090	$8,630,420	Noncompetitive	$1,927,400	$1,475,155

HEADLINE: A New Record For Bond Rater

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The number of corporate credit ratings lowered by the Standard & Poor's Corporation in 1990 nearly doubled, shattering the record set in 1989, Standard & Poor's chief rating officer said yesterday.
Branding the fast-track 1980's "a decade of lost opportunities," Leo C. O'Neill, president of the Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, warned of more painful times to come unless bond issuers put their financial houses in order.
"This year will be a critical test to determine whether the decade-long deterioration of credit quality in the 1980's continues," Mr. O'Neill said in a speech in Manhattan.
In the latest indication of the nation's deepening economic problems, S.& P. reported that the total of 768 downgrades in corporate long-term ratings in 1990 was quadruple the number of upgrades, and nearly double 1989's record number of 419 downgrades.
Ratings by S.& P. and Moody's Investors Service, the other major rating service, are used to help investors weigh the riskiness of new bond issues and have an enormous influence on the amount of interest a bond issuer must pay. The ratings are considered an important gauge of a company's fiscal soundness.

HEADLINE: Profits, and Problems, for Recycler

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHNSONVILLE, S.C.

 BODY:
Long before the recent spate of announcements of recycling plans by producers and users of plastic, Wellman Inc. was quietly demonstrating that a large, profitable business could be built using waste plastic as a raw material.
But Wellman's plant here also stands as noisy testimony that recycling is much harder and more expensive than many would-be participants might expect. Wellman has invested millions of dollars and years of trial and error, yet finds itself forced to scramble for new sources of waste plastic, to invent new technology for processing the increasingly mixed stream of plastic it receives, and to find new ways to market the polyester, nylon and other products it makes from the recycled material.
 
Flakes to Fluff to Fiber
 Each day at this sprawling plant in the flat marshlands of eastern South Carolina, an hour's drive from the Atlantic coast, bottles, photographic film and industrial waste undergo a deafening transition from refuse into fibers, which will mainly become carpeting and stuffing for furniture, bedding and sports garments. The waste is transformed into small flakes, then cotton-candy-like fluff, then sleek filament, and finally crinkled fiber. 
 Wellman, which has its bare-bones corporate headquarters in Shrewsbury, N.J., earned $50.2 million, on sales of $623.4 million, in the first nine months of last year. Nearly half of the revenues come from lines that rely on plastic wastes.
The company has long been the nation's largest consumer of waste plastic, but played down that fact until it decided to sell shares to the public two years ago. "We were afraid that our customers wouldn't like it," said Thomas M. Duff, Wellman's president and chief executive.
Wellman's plunge into plastic recycling began here in 1964 when the company, then a family-owned wool processor, wanted to branch into fiber production. Unable to afford the machinery that the Du Ponts, Dows and Monsantos of the world used to create long chains of plastic molecules known as polymers, the company began buying polymerized plastic wastes from major manufacturers to use as a raw material.
Wellman added plastic soda bottles to its stream of materials in 1979, and then photographic and X-ray film waste. The technology used to do the job is a changing patchwork that Wellman jealously guards.
"They visit us often, but they never let me visit their plant," said Jose Fernandes, project manager for the Center for Plastic Recycling Research of Rutgers University. The center's efforts to develop a public recycling technology have been incorporated in Day Products Inc.'s year-old plant in Bridgeport, N.J., south of Philadelphia, which was constructed by Day's parent, the Philadelphia engineering firm Day & Zimmermann.
 
Rival With a Taste for Bottles
 The new plant is the first to rival Wellman's Johnsonville operation in its appetite for soda bottles, although smaller processors also recycle bottles. Indeed, the expansion plans of Day and other rivals may eventually plunge Wellman into bidding wars for its raw material that could trim its cost advantage over fiber producers that use raw chemicals.
That battle could become especially ferocious if the Coca-Cola Company and Pepsico Inc. proceed with their recently announced plans to recycle soda bottles. Environmentalists favor such action, because the plastic would be repeatedly reused instead of ending up in a product like carpeting that would become waste when worn out.
Mr. Duff branded the cola companies' announcement as a public relations stunt that would prove too costly to pursue. He points to the collapse of the Dow Chemical Company's joint venture with Domtar Inc. of Montreal to recycle polyethylene terephthalate, or PET bottle plastic. Dow pulled out of the venture after assessing the operation of a pilot plant for a year; Mr. Duff said Dow's move demonstrated the big hurdles facing even the richest would-be recyclers.
 
A Recycling Jumble
 Still, Wellman concedes that any technological advantage it enjoys may be short-lived. The company is rushing to finish a production line capable of handling a wider range of plastics, because the curbside recycling programs that are the newest supply of waste rarely produce the relatively pure stream of PET plastic derived from collections in the nine states and three Canadian provinces that have bottle-deposit laws.
Wellman has a growing business recycling high-density polyethylene, or HDPE, the plastic used in milk cartons and detergent bottles. But it has no current use for lightweight polystyrene, like the "clamshells" used in packing; polyvinyl chloride, widely used in plumbing components, and other plastics, not to mention a variety of other wastes that confused or indifferent homeowners often leave out for curbside collection. The company also has to contend with continual changes in the materials and adhesives used in caps and labels.
"There's lots of room for materials-handling improvements," said Calvin Hughes, vice president in charge of operations for the plastics business here. "The next plant will be considerably different than the new line we haven't finished yet."
 
'Competing With Landfills'
 In order to grab more plastic, Wellman has made a number of aggressive strategic moves. In 1989, it entered a joint venture with Browning-Ferris Industries, the nation's second-largest waste collector, to promote the inclusion of plastic recycling in curbside programs. Last year, it bought New England CRInc., a builder and operator of plants that automate the separation of trash collected from homes and businesses.
"This gets us into the business of competing with landfills," Mr. Duff said. "That's not great, but we'll get some money out of it, and it will guarantee our supply."
At the other end of the line, Mr. Duff wants to acquire a company that will allow Wellman to sell valuable finished products made from the HDPE plastic the company now sells to other manufacturers. That might seem difficult, given the $415 million in debt it took on in the $554 million acquisition of Fiber Industries from the Hoechst Celanese Corporation in 1989, but Mr. Duff is unfazed.
"We have already paid off $100 million of that debt," Mr. Duff said. "We have shown that when properly run, we are a fairly good cash machine."
 
Acquired From Family
 That ability was first tested when the Narragansett Capital Corporation of Providence, R.I., acquired Wellman from the Wellman family in a leveraged buyout with the current management; Narragansett has since sold its interest in the company. Putting behind them the family's infighting and a period of underinvestment, the managers were able to improve efficiency sharply, Mr. Duff said. Now, the company is benefiting from the production expertise it acquired with Fiber Industries.
"They were a lot more sophisticated than us in process controls," Mr. Duff said. "Ours had become more art than science as we grew."
Wellman thinks the day is coming when some customers will advertise their use of "environmentally friendly" fibers made from waste plastic. For now, though, everyone figures that most consumers do not want to know that their rug or pillow used to be trash, so Wellman generally keeps quiet about who buys its products even as it seeks to generate more attention to its role as a recycler.
 
Overly Enthusiastic Investors
 Despite Wellman's secrecy about its processes and its customer base, investors have heard enough to get excited -- at times overexcited -- by the company's prospects. Investors realized that as more and more states mandated plastic-recycling programs, the company would find it easier to secure the raw materials it needs. That drove up its stock price.
But securing a supply is only one challenge. "Some investors lost track of the fact that we are a fiber company, along with the risks that go into that," Mr. Duff said.
They were surprised when the company's earnings reflected a decline in domestic fiber prices as the economy weakened and as production declined at a Wellman plant in Ireland because of growing import competition in textiles in Europe. Wellman also felt the impact of rising oil prices, since it uses chemicals in its Fiber Industries plants that make fine-grade polyester. As a result, Wellman's stock fell last year from more than $33 in May to a low of $12.875 in mid-October. [The shares closed Monday at $17.75 each on the New York Stock Exchange, down 50 cents.]
 
Taking Market Share
 Some analysts say the fourth quarter may produce a loss and earnings next year will be relatively flat, but that does not mean they are sour on Wellman. The strategy has been to follow the pricing lead of the industry giants, notably Du Pont and Hoechst Celanese, in order to keep production going at close to full tilt.
"Their basic story is still true: they are the low-cost producer in all their businesses and they are taking market share," said Patrick McVeigh, who follows the company for the Franklin Research and Development Corporation, a Boston-based investment adviser.
The Fiber Industries acquisition brought Wellman the Fortrel brand name and 660 million pounds of new capacity, about 150 percent more than existing operations. Wellman's long-run plan is to replace with waste plastic about 25 percent of the 700 million pounds of chemicals Fiber Industries uses annually as raw materials. But the immediate impact of the deal was to make the company look more like a typical fiber producer.

HEADLINE: Sacramento Journal;
At Capitol, Raining Out a Swearing In

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Jan. 7

 BODY:
In the fifth year of drought here, Cali fornia's new Governor, Pete Wilson, thanked God for the chill rain that forced his inauguration indoors today and turned one swearing-in ceremony into two.
What was to have been an oath-taking on the west steps of the Capitol instead became two back-to-back ceremonies, one before television cameras and lawmakers in the cozy Rotunda and one for the public in the convention center across the street. The ceremony, the centerpiece of five days of parties, had to be duplicated because the television cameras could not be moved from the Capitol, where the public could not sit. 
 At both, the new Republican Governor received White House greetings from President Bush's chief of staff, John H. Sununu, took the oath of office from California Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and promised to replace "remedial" programs with "preventative" ones to solve the state's social problems.
Mr. Wilson acknowledged the financial crisis facing the most populous state, a budget shortage conservatively estimated at $6 billion over the next 18 months. "Can new programs be undertaken when existing programs seem inescapably threatened by the budget crisis?" he asked.
The Governor answered affirmatively, saying: "Now, more than ever, to lead is to choose. And the choice California must make is to give increasing attention and resources to the conditions that shape our children's lives and California's future."
The nasty work for Mr. Wilson begins almost immediately, with the State of the State message on Wednesday and the presentation of a budget on Thursday; both are expected to be austere. But until then California's 36th Governor, who is 57 years old, decided to kick up his heels.
The celebrations here cost $2 million, all of it from private donations and ticket sales, officials said.
The big event on Saturday was a fiesta for 1,400 of Mr. Wilson's supporters from San Diego, catered by his favorite hometown restaurant, El Indio. Men in dark suits and women in fur jackets dined on burritos, vats of guacamole and mass-produced margaritas that one guest said tasted like salty lime Kool-Aid.
Then on Sunday came a night of entertainment for 6,000. Wayne Newton topped the bill, along with Charlton Heston, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and the Kingston Trio. Mr. Newton is a high school chum of Gayle Wilson, the Governor's wife.
The Wilsons are known for their sing-along parties, and the citizens of Sacramento are hopeful that they will move the spritely doings here.
There has been much cranky reminiscence this week about Governors who spurned the city. Edmund G. Brown remained tied to the San Francisco social scene. His son, Jerry, slept on the floor and hung out with monks. Ronald Reagan continued to worship at a church in Bel Air, and his wife kept appointments at a Los Angeles hairdresser. And George Deukmejian, Mr. Wilson predecessor, was more or less invisible.
If the inaugural events were typical, all signs point to lively times here. Mr. Wilson's friends arrived in high spirits, tossing beach balls on the airport tarmac and chanting, "Hail, hail, Pete and Gayle." Mr. Wilson was full of amiable one-liners, introducing one of his guests, the San Diego Chicken, as "your chickenship."
The rain put a brief damper on the festivities today and spread chaos through the capital and its environs. Bellmen at the Hyatt Hotel had to rush to a discount store this morning to buy 100 umbrellas for unprepared guests.
Maintenance workers, meanwhile, raced through the puddles, moving potted fig trees from the Capitol steps to the Rotunda. And inside, glum choir members from a nearby high school shivered in the dank hallway and were forced to wear ski jackets over their white puff-sleeved gowns.
But, Mr. Wilson, was for the moment undaunted. "We will not suffer the future," he said. "We will shape it. We will not simply grow. We will manage our growth. We will not passively experience change. We will make change."

HEADLINE: World Lending Shift Is Noted

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: BASEL, Switzerland, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Banks in large industrialized countries cut their lending to Eastern Europe and the third world and lent more to developed nations in the first half of 1990, the Bank for International Settlements said today.
Overall lending to countries outside their area by the banks fell $23 billion, or 3.5 percent, to $633 billion, the bank said in a report.
The Bank for International Settlements, the central bank to the world's central banks, said total loans to Eastern Europe shrank by $5.1 billion, reflecting a rapid deterioration in the credit standing of some Eastern European countries.
Loans to Latin America fell by a record $22.8 billion, or 13 percent, in the first half of last year, with all large debtor countries sharing in the contraction.
The largest change was a drop of $12.7 billion, or 21 percent, in loans to Mexico after the Brady Plan took effect, relieving $48.5 billion in debt.
Under the plan, named after Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady of the United States, banks exchanged outstanding loans to Mexico for bonds issued by the Mexican Government at a 35 percent discount.

HEADLINE: Oil Jumps By $2.75, To $27.65

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Tough talk about the Persian Gulf, and the approach of a deadline that oil traders are calling "D-Day," helped to push oil prices sharply higher yesterday.
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for delivery next month closed up $2.75, or 11 percent, at $27.65 a barrel. 
 Heating oil also jumped, driven by cold weather and war fears. It rose 7.87 cents a gallon, to 76.17 cents. The move is equivalent to $3.31 a barrel.
Unleaded gasoline was up 7.01 cents a gallon, to 71.63 cents.
"As we approach D-Day, the tension level is increasing," said Christian D. Gohler at Merrill Lynch Futures in New York.
 
Cooling Down
 The market, which rose after the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and has fluctuated wildly since, had been falling and has been somewhat less volatile in recent days. Since Christmas Eve, the biggest move had been a drop of $1.95, on Jan. 2.
Yesterday, the spark for the price rise, traders said, was a statement by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d ruling out an extension of the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait "or be forced out." Over the weekend, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq publicly told his country to prepare for war, adding to traders' nervousness.
But forces internal to the market added to the price rise, Mr. Gohler said. As the price passed $26 a barrel, participants who were "short," or had purchased contracts requiring them to deliver oil they do not actually have, decided to cover those positions by buying contracts for delivery of oil, he said, and when they jumped in on the buying side, the price rose yet higher.
 
Changing Attitudes
 Many investors who had bought short positions have now switched and gone "long," buying contracts for future delivery at a fixed price, he said.
Peter C. Beutel, an analyst at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J., said a marked change in attitude had occurred since Friday, when prices had closed below $25 for the first time since August. "On Friday, we had a market you couldn't convince that there would be a war, no matter what you said," Mr. Beutel said. "It seems right now, there's an overwhelming sentiment that a war seems more inevitable."
Exactly what a war would mean to prices is not clear, he said, since many experts have predicted that the Iraqis cannot seriously interfere with Saudi oil exports, and damage to Iraqi or Kuwaiti fields is of no short-term importance to world oil markets.
As Mr. Beutel put it, "We've proven we can live without Iraq's and Kuwait's oil."
"But psychologically," he added, "the perception is that this could turn much nastier than people thought."
Mr. Gohler said some market participants had concluded that in case of war there would be a brief price "spike," but then the United States would open its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, pushing prices back down.
 
The Fear Is Back
 At the Geldermann Energy Group in New York, another trader, Harvey W. Abrahams, agreed that yesterday's oil price rise was in part because "we got the fear of war pushed back into the market." But he said other factors were present.
The closing price on Friday, $24.90 a barrel, was too low, he said, and would have been higher if the market had not been forced to close early because of a severed telephone cable that affected lines to the Mercantile Exchange. The market had fallen on Friday on news that the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, would meet Mr. Baker in Geneva tomorrow.
"The market never really had time to adjust to that news or figure out what it meant," Mr. Abrahams said. "It probably would have come back."
Despite the growing urgency of the Persian Gulf situation, the market may yet decline. Marcie J. Thornberry, a trader at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., also in New York, said moves this sudden were often followed by reverses. "But in the next two weeks, the trend is up," she said.
"It's definitely a rumor-driven market; whatever news comes in, it will jump up or down pretty easily," she said.

HEADLINE: Democrats Open Battle On Blame for Recession

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats began their campaign today to blame the Bush Administration for the recession.
As the first witnesses at one of the first legislative hearings of the 102d Congress, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, called three unemployed workers who are middle age and middle class. The three were recently laid off from lifelong jobs and have been unable to find other suitable work. 
 With them as props, Senator Kennedy, no longer a Presidential prospect but still a leading spokesman for the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, opened the session by declaring, "The Bush Administration has no antirecession program, no strategy to preserve jobs or relieve the suffering of those who have lost work, home, savings or businesses."
Then, the Massachusetts Senator added, "It is time for the Administration to get as serious about fighting this recession as they are about fighting in the Persian Gulf."
 
No Television Coverage
 The witnesses, one from Massachusetts, one from Indiana and the third from Wisconsin, presented compelling testimony about how they were struggling to make ends meet after plants closed and they lost what they had thought were secure jobs.
But their stories did not reach the daytime television audience that Senator Kennedy clearly wished they would. C-Span, the cable network that regularly carries Congressional hearings, instead showed the hearing about ethics charges against five Senators who were linked to Charles H. Keating Jr. on one channel and a book review program on the other.
While the unemployed workers were at the witness table, other Democratic Senators also weighed in against the Republicans. Senator Paul Simon of Illinois said, "The great legacy of the Reagan Administration is that we have forgotten too many Americans."
And Paul Wellstone, the new Senator from Minnesota at his first legislative hearing, said he hoped the country would "move from the politics of private interests in the 80's to the politics of public interests in the 90's."
 
Liberal Economists Testify
 The only Republican at the hearing, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, sympathized with the plight of the witnesses but said it was "difficult to know indeed what we can do."
After the unemployed workers, Senator Kennedy called as witnesses two prominent liberal economists, a union president, the former Labor Secretary in the Carter Administration and an expert on women's issues. The title of the hearing was "The Recession and the Work Force."
Senator Kennedy promised that his committee would consider a variety of legislation this year in the areas of education, medical care and childhood poverty, but he did not address how the new programs would be financed.
The two economists, John Kenneth Galbraith of Harvard University and Robert Eisner of Northwestern University, recommended bold new spending programs to stimulate the economy, create jobs and meet national problems like bridges and highways in disrepair. "The duration of the recession and the prospect of recovery depend extensively on what we do about it," Mr. Galbraith said.
Mr. Galbraith said the country should abandon the idea of balancing the budget as long as the recession persists, but he indicated that higher personal and corporate income taxes were necessary to meet some of the additional cost of his proposals.
Mr. Eisner has attacked for years the notion that the Federal deficit and debt were serious problems, and he did so again today.
Lynn Williams, president of the United Steelworkers of America, urged Congress to extend unemployment benefits and approve new programs to create jobs and train workers.
Ray Marshall, Labor Secretary in the Carter Administration and now a professor of economics and public affairs at the University of Texas, suggested steps to improve the skills of the American work force.
Heidi Hartmann, director of the Institute for Women's Policy Research, said that women would be disproportionately hurt by the recession because they were more likely to be employed part time and were less likely to be eligible for unemployment benefits.

Semiconductor Outlook Is Mixed

BYLINE: By Andrew Pollack

 BODY:
WITH the nation probably in a recession and the semiconductor industry's closely watched barometer at one of its lowest levels in years, now might not seem the time to buy semiconductor stocks. But a few analysts say there are bargains to be had.
The industry's barometer, the book-to-bill ratio, fell to 0.90 for November. That meant that for every $100 of shipments, the industry received only $90 in new orders, a sign that business is headed downward. Except for a brief period in 1989, the index has not been that low since the broad electronics industry slump in the mid-1980's. The index touched 0.64 in December 1984. 
 Still, there are signs of life. Some analysts say that the bad news has already been discounted and that investors will begin to buy stocks on the expectation that the bad times will end later in 1991.
"We're looking for the industry to have a pretty good year in '92," said James L. Barlage of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York. "The stocks will respond to that prospect."
Semiconductor stocks underperformed the market through much of the second half of 1990, but in the last few weeks, some have risen strongly.
One sign of hope is that there is an industry shortage in the main type of chip used to store information in computers -- dynamic random access memory chips. In the last few weeks, supplies of one type of this chip, one-megabit D-RAM's, have tightened and prices have risen, seeming to suggest that demand in the computer industry is healthier than expected. This could be good news for Texas Instruments Inc. and Micron Technology Inc., the two American companies heavily dependent on D-RAM sales. But most analysts say the shortage is temporary.
Not everyone agrees, however, that now is the time to buy semiconductor stocks. Some say the companies will report poor results for the fourth quarter of 1990.
Millard H. Phelps of Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco says business -- and the stocks -- will get worse before getting better. "The industry has not experienced the effects of the recession yet," he said.
While semiconductor stocks often move as a group, the differences among companies is becoming more important.
The Intel Corporation is considered the industry's premier company, and its stock is frequently recommended. That is because it has a monopoly on supply of the 386 microprocessor, the brains of many advanced personal computers.
Despite that monopoly, some analysts have reservations about the short-term outlook for Intel's stock. Michael A. Gumport, semiconductor analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York, said the supply of 386 chips seems to be shifting from a shortage last year to a surplus, and prices are starting to weaken.
Mr. Gumport, who gives Intel a neutral rating, also said the company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., faced for the first time the prospect of competition from companies selling their own chips that imitate the 386 and the 387, a companion chip that does high-speed mathematics. In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Intel stock closed at $38.375 a share,down 37.5 cents. It traded as high as $52 last year and as low as $28.
Mr. Gumport said he favored three stocks that have unique stories. One is Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which looks as if it will be the first company with a chip that imitates the Intel 386. Advanced Micro closed at $5 a share on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, down 12.5 cents. It traded as high as $11.375 last year and as low as $3.625.
Mr. Gumport also likes Texas Instruments, which stands to reap a huge stream of patent royalties from Japanese companies. It finished at $37.375 a share on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, up 37.5 cents, and traded in a range between $44 and $22.50 last year. Among smaller companies, Mr. Gumport likes Xilinx, which specializes in chips that users can program themselves.
Mr. Barlage of Smith Barney still favors Intel as well as Advanced Micro Devices. He also recommends the National Semiconductor Corporation, which has been plagued by losses but is redirecting its product line toward products with higher profit margins.
Mr. Barlage said that the market had "overly discounted" National's woes and that the stock could go to $9 a share. The stock closed at $4.25 a share on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, down 12.5 cents. It traded as low as $3 last year, and reached a high of $8.875.
Mr. Phelps of Hambrecht & Quist recommends the Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, a smaller company with a broad product line. He also likes Cirrus Logic, which designs and sells special-purpose circuits for disk drives and other devices.
Mr. Phelps removed his buy recommendation on Intel a few weeks ago for the first time in two years because he fears the recession will reduce demand for its microprocessors. But "from the long-term standpoint, it's still a strong story," he said.

HEADLINE: Insurance Limit On Bank Funds Seems In Doubt

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The decision on Sunday to protect all depositors in a bailout of one of the nation's largest bank companies will make a move to limit deposit insurance less likely, Government officials and lawmakers said today.
With the nation's banking industry facing declining earnings and increasing turmoil, they said any move to reduce insurance coverage now would only undermine confidence in many banks. 
 Officials and analysts said the decision to forestall panic by protecting all customer deposits, no matter how large, at the Bank of New England and two affiliated banks, as well as to keep the institutions open, would have a profound impact on the shape of legislation being prepared to overhaul the program that protects deposits.
"It is going to drive legislation for more early intervention by the regulators," said Charles E. Schumer, a member of the House Banking Committee, reflecting the views of several of his colleagues. "It is also going to break the momentum toward reducing insurance coverage."
As Washington pondered the ramifications of the bailout, the BankAmerica Corporation said today that it was interested in acquiring the three banks of the parent Bank of New England Corporation and that it had begun talking with Federal regulators before the weekend rescue. [Page D8.]
Lawrence White, an economist at New York University, said that before the weekend's events "no one in Washington was talking about runs."
"They were talking about market discipline," he said, adding that the situation in New England "could change that."
The Bush Administration has already signaled its intention to retain the present limit on insurance coverage at $100,000 for an account, but to restrict the number of accounts entitled to protection and limit the protection on deposits held by large institutions like pension funds.
Bank deposits are covered by the bank insurance fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That is the agency that on Sunday officially took over the Bank of New England, the third-largest banking company in the region and the 33d-largest in the nation, and the two other affiliated banks -- the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company and the Maine National Bank. The fund, which is expected to post record losses for 1990 and 1991, will be responsible for covering the expected $2.3 billion cost of the bailout.
The three banks reopened smoothly today, with few signs of depositor concern, as the New Bank of New England; the New Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, based in Hartford, and the New Maine National Bank, based in Portland.
The parent Bank of New England Corporation, meanwhile, filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in Federal court in Boston, under which the remaining assets will be liquidated. The parent's smallest unit, the Bank of New England Trust Company in West Palm Beach, Fla., which was not taken over, will be sold as part of its parent's liquidation.
On Capitol Hill, some representatives said today that the handling of the Bank of New England would force closer scrutiny of the regulators themselves on whether they could have averted the growing problems at the bank and within the industry.
 
Photographs of Lines
 "With the nation facing growing problems in the banking industry, the Bank of New England case offers the banking committee an excellent opportunity to determine in detail how Federal regulation is being carried out," said Henry B. Gonzalez, the House Banking Committee chairman. "This case may well offer important guidelines as the Congress moves forward on deposit insurance and regulatory reform."
A Congressional aide said that some bankers in New England had complained about the way the bank's closing was handled. One complaint was that the F.D.I.C. had waited too long to close the bank, resulting in photographs of lines of anxious depositors withdrawing their funds on Friday after the bank announced that it expected a large fourth-quarter loss. That led to heavy withdrawals at a few other banks today, the aide said. The aide declined to name those institutions that had called the Congressional office.
Some analysts had been saying for months that the Bank of New England should be closed because of its growing problems with nonperforming real estate loans. Regulators acted on Sunday, when it became clear that the failure to act could have created a panic today.
The bank insurance fund, created in response to the bank panics of the Great Depression, could become insolvent if the economy worsens or a few large banks fail. Including the $2.3 billion estimated cost to rescue the Bank of New England and the two other banks, the insurance fund is expected to post losses last year and this year of more than $9 billion, leaving it with about $4 billion.
 
'We Want to Have Our Cake'
 In preparing a plan to shore up the fund, which it is expected to be announced later this month, the Bush Administration is facing a considerable dilemma. It wants to place further restrictions on the number of bank accounts being protected to impose more discipline on the industry, but it is aware that limitations could encourage runs on banks.
"We want to have our cake and eat it too," said L. William Seidman, the chairman of the F.D.I.C. and a proponent of some limitations on the number of accounts protected.
Measures to limit the number of accounts protected have been introduced in the House.
Mr. Seidman said today in an interview that regulators had considered several other approaches over the weekend for handling the situation at the Bank of New England, but that the staffs of the F.D.I.C. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates the nation's nationally chartered banks, had recommended the plan to take over and sell the banks as the least costly alternative.
He said officials had discussed one plan to leave uninsured depositors unprotected and another to issue an announcement saying that the Government would protect all depositors without taking over the banks. A third rejected plan would have paid all depositors but closed the institutions.
The decision to protect all depositors, however, and the swiftness of the Government's moves over the weekend served as a reminder of the powerful role that psychological forces play in the lives of banks.
 
Backdrop of Bad News
 After the report Friday morning that the banking company expected a fourth-quarter loss of up to $450 million, which would essentially wipe out its reserves to cover future loan losses, many of the branches of the Bank of New England and the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company began to experience heavy withdrawals. Federal regulators have put the withdrawals on Friday and Saturday at about $1 billion, but bank officials, while conceding that volume of withdrawals was dangerously high, say it was closer to $20 million.
The financial report was issued against a backdrop of steadily distressing news in New England. Last Tuesday, the Governor of Rhode Island closed 45 credit unions and banks whose depositors had been insured by a private company that said it might not be solvent. Twenty-two of the smaller credit unions were to reopen today with Federal insurance. There have also been reports of some Massachusetts credit unions that are not insured by the Federal Government were experiencing high withdrawals.
"An important part of the phenomenon at Bank of New England was that even fully insured depositors, those with below $100,000 in their accounts, were pulling their funds," Professor White said. "Even my mother is nervous, but I keep telling her to keep her money where it is."
Responding to the shaky state of the banks, Mr. Seidman spent his day being ushered from one television program to another and sat through a stream of interviews with reporters.
"I'm trying to tell people that there's no reason for panic," Mr. Seidman said.
He also said, as he has before, that about 170 other bank failures are expected this year, "but none at this time of the size of the Bank of New England."

HEADLINE: The Transition to F.D.I.C. Control Is Said to Go Smoothly

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
When officials at the Bank of New England sent out for pizza late Sunday night, they ordered some for officials of the bank's new owners, too -- the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
That was just one of the novel situations facing officers of the bank, the region's third largest, which was placed in receivership by the F.D.I.C. on Sunday. Today the officers were trying to figure out such elementary questions as who has the authority to make decisions or what were their legal lending limits, an interesting proposition for a bank that has just failed. 
 But Tim McNamar, vice chairman of what the F.D.I.C. has renamed the New Bank of New England, said Federal regulators who had arrived Sunday night had been highly professional, helping to get the legal questions unsnarled so the bank could continue operating today.
"We got the A team," Mr. McNamar said. "This was not your stereotype of them padlocking the doors and seizing the books. They made it very clear they wanted the bank to function smoothly."
In fact, the Federal regulators were polite and discreet, and kept out of sight of customers, said James Dorsey, the spokesman for the bank, which has its corporate headquarters here in Boston.
 
Board Appointed
 The agency did appoint a new five-member board for the bank, made up of agency officials. But because the F.D.I.C. decided to leave current management in place while negotiating to sell its three component banks in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine, the number of Federal officers dispatched to oversee operations was relatively small, said David Barr, a spokesman for the F.D.I.C. in Washington. This is the first time regulators have left a management in place in such a situation.
So far, Mr. Barr said, the agency has sent 46 officials to the main office and computer center of the Bank of New England in Boston, 40 to the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company in Hartford and 25 to the Maine National Bank in Portland. These officials include investigators, accountants, office managers and claims personnel.
But Mr. Barr said the F.D.I.C. had deliberately decided not to send its personnel into every branch of the Bank of New England, and was letting the bank's management, headed by the chairman, Lawrence K. Fish, stay in place pending a negotiated sale. Mr. Fish took over only in March, and Mr. Barr said he and his managers "weren't the root of the problem."
"They were doing everything in their power to turn it around," Mr. Barr said. "They just ran out of time." The bank's huge portfolio of bad real estate loans worsened as the region's economy slipped further into a slump.
Mr. Dorsey, the bank's spokesman, said that a number of large corporate customers who had pulled their accounts out of the Bank of New England late last week, contributing to a run, had returned today to redeposit their money. The Government put the size of the run at $1 billion, while the bank said it was only about $20 million. But Mr. Dorsey declined to name any of the companies, citing confidentiality rules.
At tellers' windows today, the evidence of the public's reaction to the F.D.I.C. takeover was mixed. Linda Arena, a 25-year-old office administrator, arrived at the Copley Square branch of the Bank of New England at 7 A.M., an hour before the bank opened, to close out a $1,100 money market account she had opened last year.
"My husband kept saying: 'Why did you put your money in the Bank of New England? It's going to close,' " Ms. Arena explained. "So this morning when he heard the news on the radio, he was, like, 'Told you so.' "
 
A $100,000 Withdrawal
 At the bank's headquarters office on State Street, in Boston's financial district, a woman in a full-length black mink coat withdrew a $100,000 certificate of deposit. The woman, who would identify herself only as an administrator for the Boston School Department, said, "Given the events, there was no question in my mind what to do."
"We saw Rhode Island," the woman added, referring to the closing of 45 banks and credit unions in Rhode Island last week by Gov. Bruce Sundlun after questions were raised about the solvency of the private insurance fund that backed them.
But others were more optimistic. James Shannon, a 32-year-old finance executive, stopped at the bank's Copley Place branch on his way to work this morning just to peer in the glass doors. He said he had a certificate of deposit at the bank but was not worried. "It's insured," he said. "I don't want to break it; it's a good rate."
"This morning my wife said, 'Did you hear about the Bank of New England being taken over?' " Mr. Shannon related. "I said, 'No. Did you know we have money there?' "
Mr. Barr, the F.D.I.C. spokesman, said that the Federal agency would appoint two senior officials to supervise the Bank of New England, but that they have not been selected yet. In addition, he said, the F.D.I.C. wanted to appoint a new board made up of local citizens to take over from the five-member panel just installed by the agency.
Many of the F.D.I.C. officials being sent to the three banks that made up the Bank of England were drawn from a new F.D.I.C. office in Franklin, Mass., near the Rhode Island border.

HEADLINE: BankAmerica Shows Interest in Failed Units

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The BankAmerica Corporation said yesterday that it was interested in acquiring the three failed banks of the Bank of New England Corporation and "is in discussion" with the F.D.I.C., which took control of the banks on Sunday.
The opportunity to acquire the largest branch network in New England was attractive enough for BankAmerica, based in San Francisco, that it began talking with Federal regulators about an acquisition before the three banks were put under Government control. 
 But while BankAmerica has an early start in analyzing the Bank of New England units in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine, it is not likely to be the only bidder. Government regulators said two unidentified American banking companies from outside New England had discussed the possibility of acquiring the banks before Sunday and more interested buyers would probably step forward.
 
Interest by Banc One Seen
 The Banc One Corporation, often mentioned as a prime candidate because it is the most strongly capitalized large banking company in the country and has a history of successfully acquiring other banks, also said yesterday that it was interested.
John Russell, a senior vice president at Banc One, said the Columbus, Ohio, company had not received a detailed package describing the failed banks' business, "but when we do, we will certainly look at it."
Thomas Brown, a banking analyst at Paine Webber, said that "because of its economic problems, New England would be low on the list of regions where I would want to own a banking franchise." But he added that "with enough Government assistance, the Bank of New England units should look very attractive." The failed banks' 310 branches and the $16.8 billion of deposits they hold are the most attractive part of the business, he said.
According to one banking representative who has already talked with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation about buying the Bank of New England units, bankers will insist that the F.D.I.C. keep the worst loans and give the acquiring bank the right to return other loans that prove to be bad. The amount of loans that might be returned and the length of time that they may be returned will be important points in the negotiations between bankers and the F.D.I.C.
Because the New England economy is still weakening, a representative of one bank said buyers might insist on a three- or four-year period for deciding which loans they would accept. In Texas, the review period was two years at most and only months for some small institutions.
 
Consumer Banking Strategy
 For BankAmerica, the nation's No. 2 banking company, a move to acquire the New England banking units is a reminder of its commitment to develop a consumer banking business that reaches far beyond California. Flush with profits that totaled $1.1 billion last year and are expected to be even greater this year, BankAmerica has spent more than $400 million to acquire 193 branches in Arizona and Oregon in the last year.
Richard Rosenberg, the chairman. said late last year that BankAmerica's strategy was to concentrate on the Western United States, but added that the company was mindful of the intangible value of its name in other parts of the country.
Mr. Brown of Paine Webber said the success Banc One and the NCNB Corporation, based in Charlotte, N.C., had had with large acquisitions in Texas reminds bankers of the opportunity they may be missing. "But this has been a year of tremendous pain and uncertainty for banks, and a lot of them will shy away from the opportunity," he said.
Federal regulators are expected to insist that any buyer be in strong financial condition and not too vulnerable to problems with bad loans of its own making. But some analysts say the Government's willingness to hold the bad loans will mean the acquisition might not require the buyer to provide much more than $500 million or $600 million of capital.
A recent study by the First Manhattan Consulting Group showed that "the retail franchise, especially the branch franchise, is the most valuable part of commercial banking," said James M. McCormick, president of the consulting firm. He estimated that the branches and the business they generate account for about $80 billion, or 47 percent of the value of banking companies, but require only $30 billion, or 14 percent, of the capital banks hold.
For some banking companies that have the strength for expansion, the opportunity comes when they are preoccupied with other purchases. Officials at Norwest, based in Minneapolis, and PNC Financial, based in Pittsburgh, two strong regional companies also mentioned as potential bidders, said they were not interested in the Bank of New England and would concentrate on opportunities closer to home.
Because other New England banks like the Bank of Boston, Shawmut and Fleet/Norstar also face loan problems, though not comparable to Bank of New England's, analysts do not expect them to bid.
Large New York banks would undoubtedly like to expand into New England, but may be constrained, analysts said, by the fact that some, like Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and Chemical Banking, are below or barely above the minimum capital standards set by regulators and have had problems with bad loans.
Other potential buyers mentioned by analysts include National City of Cleveland; NCNB and First Union of Charlotte, N.C.; Corestates Financial of Philadelphia; Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh and Wells Fargo of San Francisco. All those companies declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Mosbacher On Recession

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 7

 BODY:
The recession in the United States will be short and mild, with rising exports to Latin America helping to blunt its effects, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said today.
Mosbacher, in Detroit for a press preview of the North American International Auto Show, said the American trade deficit had been on its way to falling below $100 billion before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Since then, principally because of high oil and gasoline prices, the deficit has remained at the $100 billion annual mark.
But exports, Mosbacher said, "will be the engine that pulls out of this downturn or recession or whatever."
Although there are signs that Europe and Asia are beginning to feel the effects of the United States recession, countries in Latin America and South America will be ready to buy new United States exports, the secretary said.
"There's burgeoning demand as the economies in Mexico and Latin America increase," he said. "If the recession, down period, is as short and shallow as it should be, then it will be so overseas."

HEADLINE: Jet Workers' Last Hopes Dashed by Announcement

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS, Jan. 7

 BODY:
It was cold and icy outside when Cassell Williams got the telephone call bearing the news that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had canceled plans to build a new Navy attack plane. He knew the announcement meant that about 1,500 members of his union would get layoff notices in the next few days.
"I was shocked because I didn't think they could scrap a program that was at this stage," said Mr. Williams, the president of District 837 of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the largest union at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation. "I thought they could overcome the problems they had." 
 In Fort Worth, where several thousand workers at the General Dynamics Corporation plant will soon be dismissed, the reaction was the same.
 
'A Lot of Shocked People'
 "The gut feeling in the factory up until at least this afternoon was that the Defense Department was trying to salvage the program," said Jim Bricker, president of Local 900 of the Federated Independent Texas Unions. "There are going to be a lot of shocked people."
But Michael L. Hester, chief of human resources at the General Dynamics plant, was optimistic that many workers would be able to find jobs in Fort Worth, or nearby, where the economy has been growing for the last three years.
"We feel confident that many of these people who desire to stay in the local area will come out equal, hopefully, to what they had when they left us," he said.
Mr. Williams and others were not as optimistic for the future of the workers in St. Louis, still reeling from the layoffs of more than 4,000 McDonnell Douglas workers last summer. The city's economy is dependent on military spending and the automotive industry, both of which have been hurt by the nation's economic slowdown.
One McDonnell Douglas worker said he did not expect to lose his own job. Nevertheless, he said, "we're all worrying about tomorrow, with or without the project."
Workers officially learned of the Pentagon's cancellation of the A-12 program at about 6 P.M., when John F. McDonnell, the company's chairman and chief executive, announced the decision over loudspeakers. But local television and radio stations had already been reporting the move for about two hours, and friends and relatives of company workers had been calling the plant with the news.
Terry Lloyd, a structural mechanic who has worked for McDonnell Douglas since 1986, tried to find a reason for hope. In an interview during his lunch break tonight, he said, "Personally, it's not as bad for me, because I'm not married."
But when asked what he would do next, he replied: "Good question. I only have a high school education. I make $35,000 a year now. Any job I take, maybe I'll get $20,000."
The dismissals at both companies will be based on seniority. Mr. Lloyd said his starting date had fallen just short of the deadline set by McDonnell Douglas for the layoffs.
"They're going and laying off people who are actually making airplanes," he said. "I don't understand why they do that."
In Fort Worth, Mr. Bricker said, "I've got some people who are senior in age, but not senior in time."
He added: "We had three brand new hires who came in today who had transferred from the engineering department. They probably will get notices tomorrow."

HEADLINE: For Contemporary Music, Times Are Hard

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
For the contemporary music world, which has for decades been a vital part of New York City's musical life, the 1990's are shaping up as a bleak time.
The small but dedicated audience for new music has been shrinking just as several of the city's most prominent new-music ensembles -- among them, the Group for Contemporary Music, Speculum Musicae and Parnassus -- have been hit by reductions in government, corporate and foundation funds. Indeed, some groups have been told that their grants are to be further reduced or eliminated next season. 
 Similar financial strains have shaken arts programs of all kinds. But these pressures are particularly hard for the new-music groups to sustain because as their income from grants and ticket sales has been falling, the cost of presenting concerts has been rising.
Many of the ensembles have started cutting back on their New York performances. William Hellermann, who edits the Calendar for New Music and performs with the Downtown Ensemble, said that his publication's concert listings were down by 20 percent from last year.
 
Biggest Worry: Audience Lag
 What worries the musicians most is that some financing agencies are starting to take audience size into consideration when making grants. Anthony Korf of the Parnassus ensemble, which is performing tonight at Merkin Concert Hall, said that when the New York State Council on the Arts cut Parnassus' grant to $9,000 from $11,000 this year, he was told that the cut had been made because his audience had dwindled. When the council made emergency cuts this fall, the grant was whittled to $7,000.
"In the past, the council has expressed concern about the size of our audiences," said Mr. Korf. "But you can't apply market economy values to something like contemporary music. On a per-capita basis, the funding for new music has always been absurdly high. But the value of Parnassus and groups like us is not how many people we entertain in a night. It's that we are helping composers who are living and writing today, and who need the outlet."
Among the composers the 17-year-old ensemble has championed over the years are Donald Martino, Mario Davidovsky, Gunther Schuller and Jonathan Harvey. Tonight's program includes works by Milton Babbitt, Charles Wuorinen and Miriam Gideon, alongside one 20th-century throwback, a Prokofiev song cycle, offered as a centenary tribute.
"For years," Mr. Korf added, "people who play in Parnassus and other groups have taken pay cuts and contributed their own money to be part of this, because they believe in the music."
 
'Paying More Attention'
 Mary Hays, the executive director of the New York State Council on the Arts, said that the size of a group's audience had always been among the factors the council considered. "But we have been paying more attention to it as times have gotten hard," she said. "Groups that have been around for many years have had time to do some marketing and to have made an effort to develop an audience. That's a very difficult thing with the contemporary arts, and we have had some difficult choices to make."
Several directors said that budget constraints were forcing them to program works that require fewer players. One ensemble, the 29-year-old Group for Contemporary Music, suffered a 60 percent cut in its grant income in 1990, and is giving only one concert this season, a program of string quartets. The group has decided to concentrate on recordings instead of concerts. Another ensemble, the 13-year-old Musical Elements, is in the second season of what its director says is a sabbatical.
Whether they specialize in the rigorous, atonal Uptown styles, or in the freewheeling experimentalism of the Downtown schools, the musicians in these ensembles seem to agree on one point: Although they are willing to broaden their programming, they insist that they will not abandon their chosen repertories in the hope of attracting larger audiences or to please potential contributors.
 
Commerce and Trends
 "I'm not sure the problem is completely economic," Mr. Korf of Parnassus said. "Things have gotten more commercialized. People tend to be wowed by trendiness, which is unfortunate. But just because we don't do Minimalism, or aleatoric works, or some of the derivative works that are called neo-Romantic, does not mean that we are a stuffy academic group. We play music that we find wonderful and expressive and rewarding. We have to figure out ways to get people to experience that."
Patricia Spencer, a flutist in the Da Capo Chamber Players, said that her ensemble had lost one of its principal fund sources this year, and would probably lose another next year.
"We'll be looking for additional funds, and making more grant applications than we used to," said Ms. Spencer, whose group is celebrating its 20th anniversary this season, "but we might also have to change our activities. That might mean playing lower-profile concerts in New York, or concentrating more on recordings. But we don't expect these problems to affect our repertory. I doubt that anyone who plays in a contemporary- music group ever expected to earn a lot of money. We play it because it's what we love."
Andrew Berger, the director of the concert division at the Hebrew Arts School, which runs Merkin Concert Hall, keeps tabs on the new-music groups that play there, and has a hand in programming the school's own Music Today series. When Gerard Schwarz stepped down last season as director of Music Today, Mr. Berger undertook a study of the series and found that the sentiments Ms. Spencer expressed were fairly common.
 
More Pay Elsewhere
 "What surprised us were the musicians," Mr. Berger said. "These are some of the busiest freelancers in New York, and we weren't sure whether they were in it because of Gerry, or because it was just another gig. What we found was that if they weren't playing in Music Today, they would probably be making more money elsewhere. But they said that they consider this some of the most interesting and exciting music they have a chance to play."
Mr. Berger added, however, that the audiences for both Music Today and the other ensembles that rent Merkin Concert Hall had shrunk considerably in recent years. One group that performs there, the 20-year-old Speculum Musicae, is addressing the problem by offering discount tickets to college and conservatory students. Others say they have not yet found a solution.
Several musicians noted that there was an excitement in the contemporary music world in the 1960's and the 1970's that had largely disappeared. But most of those interviewed about the audience problem said that they considered the public education system was at least partly to blame for failing to give students a grounding in cultural literacy, or even a sense that the arts are of value. Others said the lack of broad interest in contemporary classical music had deeper roots.
"The real problem," said Mr. Wuorinen, who was a founder of the Group for Contemporary Music, "is that we have reached the stage, under the impulse of cultural populism, where we are incapable of measuring or acknowledging artistic merit except in terms of commercial success. We don't distinguish between the committed, passionate audience and the trend-seeking yuppie audience. We just count bodies and measure sales.
"I'm convinced that this is the result of cultural attitudes that started in the late 1960's. People no longer perceive that there are levels of high art and low art, which we move up and down among according to our needs. In fact, the existence of a hierarchy of values is denied, and one sees it argued that pop singing and opera singing are equivalent. When that drumbeat has been sounded for 20 years, it's going to have an effect."
 
More Competition for Funds
 Most of the groups that reported substantial cuts in government support said that they had been sustained by grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Mary Flagler Carey Charitable Trust, the J. M. Kaplan Fund, the Jerome Foundation and Meet the Composer, all of which have maintained sizable contemporary-music programs. But as government financing evaporates, more groups are finding themselves scrambling for money from the same limited pool of patrons.
"The funding situation for small groups is bordering on the disastrous," Mr. Hellermann of the Downtown Ensemble said. "In the past, we were able to raise money by going around to corporations and small foundations and getting $200 or $500 here and there. But that has dried up."
Groups are finding that larger foundations that have not supported new music in the past are not inclined to start now. "I have been writing to lots of foundations and finding that many of them want a broader appeal and greater national visibility than we can give them," said Amy Roberts Frawley, Speculum Musicae's administrative director.
"The fund-raising climate has always been difficult," said Robert Beaser, a director of Musical Elements and the composer in residence of the American Composers Orchestra. "But doing contemporary music is different from doing standard repertory. Nobody does it to get rich. We do it to generate new works, to play the music really well, to make the repertory happen. If those things are important to you, you do it for your whole life. It's a cause more than anything else. So I think we'll be able to muddle through, one way or another."

HEADLINE: Technology Transcends the Borders of Nations

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"M.I.T. Deal with Japan Stirs Fear on Competition" (front page, Dec. 19) presents a somewhat distorted picture of international scientific and economic trade. 
 When President John F. Kennedy asked me to go to Japan in 1962 to open cooperative scientific ventures, I was surprised to see how good Japanese technology was. It was technically excellent. Much later, in 1979, as president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co-founder of the M.I.T. Media Lab with Prof. Nicholas Negroponte, I returned to Japan. The technical excellence I had found in 1962 had been transformed into industrial achievement in areas that the United States was clearly -- and shortsightedly -- abandoning.
This was particularly true in communications and entertainment media. I personally remember the chief executive officer of RCA deciding to discontinue further development of videocassette recorders for reasons of short-term costs. And the Ampex Company had to license its VCR to Sony because it did not have the funds to market it. The Japanese industrialists in 1979 did not fear competition. They were used to fierce competition in Japan and anticipated it from the United States.
The Media Lab, the focus of your article, started operations five years ago. Since then, industry has supplied an average of 80 percent of the research funds; Japanese industry has supplied 14 percent. Much of the technology we exploit comes from Japan. The idea to approach Nihon University came in 1986 from a Congressionally mandated United States-Japan committee for promoting trade expansion. The agreement with Nihon and Chiyoji Misawa provided M.I.T. permanent endowment funds of $10 million, which yield about $500,000 a year for the Media Lab's academic program, faculty and students.
The Media Lab has become an international center of creativity in media arts and sciences in the United States, from computerized learning for elementary school students to computer-generated holograms and intelligent pianos.
The Japanese contributions to the M.I.T. Media Lab helped make it possible for American scientists to compete, indeed lead, in these fields. The digital high definition television referred to in "U.S. Makes Gains in Race to Develop Advanced TV" (front page, Dec. 21) was pioneered at the M.I.T. Media Lab, which played an important part in its development.
As for your headline, do Americans really fear competition and free enterprise? Is an export of a United States product automatically good, but an export of a United States idea automatically bad? Should ideas and information be paid for? And what is the nationality of a product or idea? Sony manufactures televisions in California, and Zenith manufactures televisions in Mexico. Does that make a Sony set more "American"?
We have to get beyond the old way of thinking in economics, just as we have in arms control and disarmament. We need an informed debate in the nation and the world, reflecting the subtleties and complexities of international life, trade, economics and how the United States supports scientific and technological research that drives our economy. We need to understand the complexities of the balance of trade of money and ideas.
Your article does not deal in these subtleties and complexities. Indeed, your tone calls your fairness into question. Contrary to what you say, M.I.T. requires that all research done under the agreement is to be freely published, without restrictions.
I note that when United States automobile companies make extensive efforts to replicate the production environment of Japanese car makers, the United States news media do not protest.

Rating Lowered For Nynex Unit

 BODY:
The rating on about $2.3 billion in New England Telephone and Telegraph Company long-term debt has been lowered to Aa-2, from Aa-1, Moody's Investors Service announced yesterday. New England Telephone is a unit of the Nynex Corporation.
Analysts at the rating agency said the telephone company's weakened operating performance and debt protection measurements were unlikely to return soon to their levels of the 1980's because of severe weakness in the New England economy and growing competitive pressures.
Moody's said it thought the New England economy would remain weak at least in the near term.

HEADLINE: Soviet Woes Tarnish Once-Shining Space Efforts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
THE Soviet Union's space program, the largest and most active in the world, is starting to crack under the crushing weight of political and economic troubles.
Signs of stress abound. The Soviet space shuttle, which was triumphantly unveiled two years ago, has yet to carry astronauts into space. Delays in its flight schedule have upset plans for the winged ship to save the abandoned Salyut 7 space station, whose flaming debris will blaze to Earth in the next few weeks. 
 Over all, rocket launchings are at historic lows for a variety of technical and economic reasons.
And the mainstay of the Soviet program, the 100-foot-long Mir space station, has suffered repeated cuts in plans for expansion and habitation. After declaring a new era in which the manned outpost orbiting Earth was to begin a "permanent" space presence, embarrassed Soviet officials in 1988 were forced to leave Mir empty for four months. More recently, three-man crews have been reduced to two.
"The program is going through a major retrenchment," said James E. Oberg, a Houston-based expert on the Soviet space program who is the author of "Red Star in Orbit."
So hungry is the program for cash that it is offering to sell space nuclear reactors for generating power in orbit -- devices that were once top secret. The United States Government is negotiating to buy one. But the Soviet Union's overall push to market space-related goods and services around the world has largely washed out, proving to be far more difficult than originally envisioned.
Looming ahead is the specter of rebellious republics seceding from the union, threatening to fragment the far-flung space enterprise.
"Rather than having one big space program they may have a lot of little ones," said John E. Pike, a space analyst with the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. He noted that the Russian republic recently launched its own communication satellite and intends to operate it independent of the central Soviet Government.
Perhaps most painfully, long-range Soviet planning is now in turmoil, jeopardizing such envisioned projects as a bold series of scientific probes, satellites that would convert sunlight into electricity for use on Earth and what had long been the holy grail of Soviet space aspirations -- a manned voyage to Mars.
"There are so many changes going on in the Soviet Union that it's impossible to see how it's going to sort itself out," said Marcia S. Smith, a space specialist at the Library of Congress.
To be sure, parts of the Soviet program are still vigorous, especially those linked to the military. Western experts note that recent overall rates of rocket launchings, while at historic lows, still surpass those of any other nation. Last year the Soviet Union launched at least 75 rockets that carried payloads into orbit. That represented more than two-thirds of such global activity. In the 1980's, the Soviet Union frequently launched more than 100 large rockets a year. The recent reductions, analysts say, have as much to do with the rising life span of Soviet satellites as the economic pressures on the overall space program.
Still, for a nation that inaugurated the space age with the flight of Sputnik in 1957, lofted the first man into orbit and achieved a host of other firsts, the sudden reversals have come as a shock.
Nikolai N. Ponomarev-Stepnoi, deputy director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow, recently lamented that a factory to make space reactors "is now being converted for the manufacture of automatic systems for producing, of all things, milk cartons."
 
Budget Cuts Take Toll
 The Soviet space program is a vast, secretive enterprise that was formed in the cauldron of the cold war. For decades its successes dazzled the world and were the envy of space-faring nations. Although there are exceptions, its triumphs have tended to come from application of brute strength rather than cutting-edge technology. For instance, its rocket engines tend to be reliable monsters rather than the small, temperamental, high-temperature, high-pressure ones often used in the West.
What has recently started to fracture the program are cuts in funds, especially for manned operations. Mr. Oberg, the Houston analyst, said the program had suffered 10 percent reductions two years in a row.
Nowhere are the effects more noticeable then in the Soviet shuttle program, which got off to a spectacular start in November 1988 with the maiden flight of the winged, re-usable Buran, whose name means snowstorm or blizzard. That flight was unmanned. But Soviet officials confidently predicted that the craft would soon be carrying astronauts into space at least once a year, with the rate eventually rising to as many as four flights a year.
So far, there have been no follow-up flights, and some experts have suggested that chronic problems in the country's economy may keep it that way.
"The question is not when but if it will ever fly again," said Mr. Oberg, the Houston analyst, who recently visited Soviet space centers. He added that the shuttle was seen by much of the Soviet public as a "white elephant."
"It's one of the most vulnerable programs in terms of cutbacks," Mr. Oberg said in an interview.
A prominent victim of the shuttle is Salyut 7. Buran was to rendezvous with the 40-ton abandoned space station and, according to Soviet press reports, bring it back to Earth. At the least, American experts say, large parts of the outpost would have been returned for study. But the derelict station is now expected to crash through the atmosphere in a rain of fiery debris, some of which may strike Earth's surface.
 
A Leap and Then a Crawl
 The space program's most visible element, Mir, is also in trouble, and not simply because of crew cutbacks. Its construction is stymied. The Salyut space stations were simple cylinders about the size of a house trailer. Mir, or "peace" in Russian, when flung aloft in February 1986, marked an architectural leap forward. Although basically a large cylinder, it also had a central hub with five docking ports from which four large research modules, each a pressurized cylinder as big as the core itself, were to be fastened. The extra port was for the Soyuz craft that transports Soviet astronauts to and from the station.
According to plan, all four large add-ons should have been in place and functioning by 1990, with as many as six astronauts in the roomy complex at work on experiments meant to advance the frontiers of science. Instead, only two of the modules have been added and only two Soviet astronauts now routinely occupy Mir. The problems, analysts say, are planning lapses, equipment failures and intense budget pressures that have halted progress and sown confusion.
"They've thrown out the map," said Mr. Oberg, the Houston analyst. The emerging strategy, he said, is to sell as much space as possible aboard Mir to foreign astronauts, as the Soviets did recently by taking a Japanese reporter aloft for $12 million. Expansion of the outpost in space is much harder to justify given the collapse of the economy on the ground, he added.
 
From Pride to Embarrassment
 "With chronic shortages of soap and antibiotics, the issue of space flight is almost embarrassing," Mr. Oberg said.
The Soviet plan to rescue its space program with revenue from foreign sales has been disappointing, Western experts say. The sales blitz started around 1987 as slick brochures and eager managers offered everything from launching services and communication satellites to space photographs and rocket engines.
"Soviet successes have been modest, partly due to business inexperience and partly due to Western technology transfer restrictions," Nicholas L. Johnson, an expert on the Soviet space program at Teledyne Brown Engineering in Colorado Springs who is the author of "Soviet Year in Space," noted in his most recent report. For instance, the technology restrictions have kept Western satellites from being sent into space atop Soviet rockets, an operation that could be quite lucrative.
 
Political Turmoil and Uncertainty
 The trouble has been compounded by jurisdictional warfare within the Soviet space establishment over who should lead the commercial effort as well as the nation's general political turmoil and the West's uncertainly concerning who will be running the country in six months.
 "No one knows, including those in the Soviet Union, what direction the civilian program will take," said Ms. Smith of the Library of Congress. "They have a hard time getting money even for projects that have high priority. The whole bureaucracy is up in the air, which makes it all the more confusing. Over all, the program is in for some very tough times."

HEADLINE: Selling Out the Baltics

BYLINE: By Tunne Kelam and Mari-Ann Rikken; Tunne Kelam is chairman of the Congress of Estonia. Mari-Ann Rikken is vice president of the Estonian-American National Council Inc.

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Va.

 BODY:
George Bush has drawn a line in the sand in the Middle East but is putting his head in the sand in Europe. While America rushes to war in the Middle East, allegedly to defend the sovereignty of a small nation against aggression by a larger neighbor, the Administration has expressed only its "concern" about the Soviet Union sending troops into the Baltic states.
Mr. Bush must make it clear to Mikhail Gorbachev that even a creeping crackdown by the Soviets would mean an end to U.S. aid -- including the recent food credits. 
 This is all familiar terrain for the Soviet leadership, which historically has sought to synchronize power grabs with dramatic world events. Thus, as President Bush seeks a worldwide consensus -- seemingly at any price -- to support U.S. military action against Iraq, the Soviet Union, hypocritically bemoaning Saddam Hussein's moves in Kuwait, is preparing for a vicious crackdown against three small nations.
Once again -- as the Soviet Union flies in tens of thousands of troops to round up a few thousand young boys who refuse to serve in the Red Army, closes down independent publications and prepares an economic blockade -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania seem destined to end up a tragic footnote to larger events of history. This is precisely what happened in June 1940, when Moscow invaded the Baltic states while the world's attention was riveted on the collapse of France.
The same principle should apply to the Baltics as to Kuwait. The West has never recognized the Soviet takeover of the Baltics. Fifty years of supportive messages from Washington to Baltic diplomatic representatives have sustained Baltic hopes for the restoration of freedom.
Now that there are real chances as well as legal grounds for regaining freedom, however, the U.S. is not living up to its promises. Instead of supporting peaceful, democratic movements in the Soviet Union, the Bush Administration seems committed to saving the last colonial empire, placing its hopes on democratizing a Soviet system led by a dictator.
It is truly ominous and ironic that the U.S. appears ready to support a new Soviet dictatorship in the hopes of promoting freedom, rule of law and free competition. Wishfully thinking that a dictatorship may be able and willing to reform itself, the world's leading democracy seems ready to sanction Soviet use of martial law and terror to save perestroika.
The U.S. should stick to its principles. There is a lesson in the events of 1917 to 1920, a period when the superpowers first tried to save the Russian empire, ignoring the national democratic movements. When it became clear that the Czar's empire couldn't be saved, the West finally changed its policies and recognized the states that had liberated themselves.
If Western support consists only of lip service at this crucial moment, the West will have to take responsibility for any desperate moves on the part of the Baltic peoples who are not only being pushed toward extinction by Soviet imperialistic policies but are now being pressured by Soviet paratroopers and economic collapse.
The development of new Lebanons in Eastern Europe can still be prevented by restraining the terror apparatus of the Soviet Union and reaffirming unequivocally the rights of the Baltic nations to independence.
We are facing a crucial test not only for the survival of the Baltic nations but also for the principles of American foreign policy. Lasting world peace and stability cannot be achieved by applying principles of justice and law unequally. Safeguarding the vital interests of the Baltic nations does not require 350,000 U.S. troops. It requires only a firm stand on a principle held for 50 years.
While President Bush is ready to spill the blood of American boys to free Kuwait, his message to the Baltic nations occupied by 300,000 Soviet troops is to help themselves. Does 50 years of occupation by the Soviet Union make such a difference? If so, how long will Kuwait have to be occupied before its sovereignty becomes an internal Iraqi matter?

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Records Broad Gains In Advance of Talks on Gulf

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose broadly yesterday as currency traders stocked up in advance of diplomatic talks today that many viewed as offering a slim chance for peace in the Persian Gulf.
Gold fell in New York, dropping $3.80 an ounce, to $390.30, on the Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $390.20 an ounce, down $2.40 from Monday's late quote. But the metal was still up for the week after its jump on Monday of more than $9 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange. Silver futures also plunged 16.1 cents an ounce yesterday, to $4.127, on the Commodity Exchange.. 
 Several currency traders said they thought it unlikely that the United States could avoid an armed Persian Gulf confrontation, despite high-level talks scheduled for today.
The dominant focus on the dollar as a safe investment overrode several economic signs, including an apparent move by the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates and a reiteration by Germany's central bank that it would continue to keep credit tight.
"By and large, traders recognize the Fed may have eased, but until we get some sort of statement from the meeting, I can't imagine anyone would be comfortable being short dollars," said Maria Nordone, vice president at the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles.
Economists earlier said that the Fed had apparently dropped the Federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other, by one-quarter percentage point, to 6.75 percent.
"Ordinarily, a credit easing would hurt because an easier monetary stance makes it less attractive to hold dollars," said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer for Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
Instead, the dollar's appeal as a investment continued to be strengthened by the gulf conflict as well as by strife in the Soviet Union, which has tended to diminish confidence in bordering economies like Germany's.
Currency traders said they bought dollars on news that Soviet troops began rolling into the Baltic region to enforce the Red Army draft. The move came after reports that thousands of young men in the republics are ignoring Red Army draft orders. In reaction to the Soviet move, the United States sharply rebuked the Kremlin for sending troops into the Baltic states.
In London, the British pound held steady at $1.9060 and in New York, sterling weakened to $1.8965 from late Monday's $1.9031.
n Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.25 yen, to a closing 136.30 yen. Later in London, it was quoted at 136.00 yen, and in New York, the dollar was quoted at a closing 136.50, up from Monday's 136.10 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5420 German marks, up from 1.5355; 1.2965 Swiss francs, up from 1.2925; 5.2330 French francs, up from 5.2065; 1,159.25 Italian lire, up from 1,153.50, and 1.1523 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1537.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Saudi Ruler Is Said to Expect a War

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 8

 BODY:
On the eve of the critical meeting between the American Secretary of State and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has evidently concluded that Iraq is not likely to withdraw from Kuwait and that therefore the international coalition against Baghdad must be prepared to strike at military targets deep inside Iraq without destroying the country itself.
A Saudi official said King Fahd shared the view of most coalition members that the meeting in Geneva on Wednesday between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Tariz Aziz of Iraq would not achieve a breakthrough toward persuading President Saddam Hussein to withdraw his forces from Kuwait. 
 "I'm convinced that the highest level of the Saudi monarchy believes that he will not withdraw," a Western diplomat said, although the Saudi official said some senior members of the Saudi royalty were slightly more optimistic than the King.
 
Pessimistic View Prevails
 With the pessimistic view of the Geneva meeting prevalent, officials of Persian Gulf states and Western diplomats said the goal of neutralizing the military capacity of Iraq for future aggression without destroying it was a "shared objective" of the United States and its key coalition partners -- Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria.
"Broadly speaking, the consensus among all the coalition partners, particularly among its key players, is that Iraq's capability to wage offensive war must be destroyed, but that the conflict should be managed so that Iraq does not become a vacuum and so it can eventually play its traditional balancing role in the gulf," a Western diplomat said.
Specifically, the official added, that means striking at Iraq's chemical infrastructure -- its weapons factories and stockpiles -- attempting to capture, rather than kill, as many Iraqi soldiers as possible, and "getting it over with as quickly as possible."
Saudi and Western officials agreed that the goal of crippling the Iraqi war machine without destroying the country would be severely complicated if Iraq used chemical weapons. "If they use chemical weapons, and we fear they will," one Saudi said, "then all bets are off, and we will retaliate massively."
 
Liberation, Not Obliteration
 But the determination to avoid the destruction of Iraq was echoed in an interview today by Abdullah Bishara, the Kuwaiti who heads the Gulf Cooperation Council, the regional military and economic cooperation group. "The goal is the liberation of Kuwait, not the obliteration of Iraq," Mr. Bishara said.
Asked whether the coalition was talking tough to persuade Mr. Hussein to withdraw, the diplomat replied that the warnings were a "serious effort" by coalition members to make President Hussein "understand what he faces, in order to avoid a war."
One Western diplomat said that although the Iraqi leader might unveil new proposals or hint at a willingness to withdraw during the Geneva talks, most coalition members were "convinced that whatever he does is aimed at delaying and temporizing."
An analyst of Saudi politics said that while many members of the coalition were publicly pessimistic about prospects for a peaceful resolution of the crisis but more optimistic in private, the opposite was true in Saudi Arabia. Two days ago, King Fahd told Western reporters that he shared President Bush's stated instinct that President Hussein would withdraw at the last minute. But privately, the King is said to be persuaded that Mr. Hussein has been playing for time.
 
Dismembering of Iraq Disclaimed
 Officials involved in crisis planning here have said that there was what one characterized as an "understanding or implicit agreement" among coalition members that a military strike against Iraq should not be used as a pretext to dismember Iraq. A Saudi official said Turkey had given Riyadh assurances, for example, that it would not try to invade and annex the Iraqi city of Mosul and other Kurdish parts of Iraq that were once part of Turkey.
Another analyst said Syria, one of the few Arab countries to have supported Iran during its war with Iraq, was believed to have received assurances from Teheran that it, too, would refrain from grabbing part of Iraq in a war.
Saudi, gulf and Western officials all asserted that cooperation was excellent among what Mr. Bishara called members of the "new order," or what some analysts of the Middle East see as the emergence of a powerful alliance among Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia and its gulf allies. One official said the principal states of the alliance might hold a summit meeting in Riyadh to make final declarations and plans before Jan. 15, the date set by the United Nations by which Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait or face the possible use of force to evict it.
One analyst of the gulf crisis said that while the Saudis, Egyptians and Syrians all believed that after a war, every effort should be made to "help Iraq back on its feet in a less aggressive stance," there were differences among them about whether a military conflict would destroy Iraq.
Egypt, the analyst said, has concluded that Iraqi soldiers would not put up an intense fight and hence that a quick and decisive victory over Iraq was likely. Syria, on the other hand, fears that Iraq would resist mightily and might therefore be destroyed in the process. The analyst said that this in turn strengthened Syria's reluctance to send forces inside Iraq, as its public declarations have suggested.
Neither Saudi nor Western officials seem to have given much thought to who might come to power in Iraq in the aftermath of a military confrontation, and there seems to have been little advance effort to prepare Saudi public opinion for what could be a large number of Saudi casualties if there is a war.

HEADLINE: C.D.'s and Bank Funds Off

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields on bank certificates of deposit and money market accounts were down for the week that ended yesterday, continuing a three-month slide.
Robert K. Heady, the publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, said that judging by the speed in which deposit rates had been falling during this cycle, the downward slide could last longer than most had predicted. If no war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, he said, yields could continue to fall throughout the year. 
 Mr. Heady added that he did not think that the cut in the prime rate last week, to 9 1/2 percent, from 10 percent, would be enough to stimulate the economy and that he saw more cuts in the rate coming.
 
Discount Rates Mixed
 At the Treasury Department's weekly auction of short-term bills on Monday, average discount rates were mixed. The auction results often influence what many banks eventually pay on money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
The three-month bill was unchanged for the third straight week, at 6.52 percent, while the six-month bill rose by 3 basis points, to 6.51 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
In the weekly survey of New York area banks, The Bank Rate Monitor noted that yields on certificates of deposit were off slightly more at commercial banks than at savings banks, but both showed moderate declines in yields.
The average yield for a money market account at a savings institution was off by a basis point, to 6.16 percent, while three-month certificates were off by 7 basis points, to 7.32 percent, and six-month certificates were off by 6 basis points, to 7.46 percent.
Yields on commercial bank money market accounts were off by 6 basis points, to 5.93 percent, while those on three-month certiticates were off by 9 basis points, to 7.01 percent, and on six-month certificates were down by 7 basis points, to 7.12 percent.
 
Other Yields Are Off
 Yields on money market accounts at 20 large banks outside the New York area were only slightly off compared with those in the New York area, falling by a basis point, to 5.97 percent. The drop in six-month certifctates around the country easily matched the decline in New York. The average yield fell by 8 basis points, to 6.90 percent.
The Bank Rate Monitor said its nationwide survey last week showed the ratio of savings rate decreases to increases had slowed to 26 to 1 from the previous week's ratio of 28 to 1. The Monitor's analysts said the ratio was considered another indicator of the direction of interest rates.

HEADLINE: Student Loan Proposal Leaves Colleges Unsure

BYLINE: By WILLIAM CELIS 3d

 BODY:
A proposal by the Bush Administration to streamline student loan programs by eliminating banks from the process has piqued the interest of colleges and universities. But they stopped short of endorsing the plan, because it does not address the problems of loan servicing and collections.
Under the Administration's proposal, all Federal student aid would go from the Federal Government directly to the educational institutions without the intermediate step of the banks, which now supply low-interest loans that carry Federal guarantees in the event of defaults. 
 Higher education associations said the process of awarding Federal student loans would be discussed in Congress, but they were not sure that the Administration's proposal would be adopted because of the questions and concerns it has generated.
 
Using Savings for More Loans
 Supporters of the plan said that by skirting the banks, which are paid fees for offering and handling the loans, the Government could save as much as $1 billion a year. The savings could then be used for more loans.
The proposal covers the three Federal Guaranteed Student Loan programs, which generated $12.3 billion in loans in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. Banks alone, through the Stafford loan program, generated $9.7 billion of the total.
But colleges maintained that the proposal did not address who would deal with loan payments and who would be responsible for collecting loans that are delinquent or in default as banks now do.
Nor does the proposal address the availability of money for student loans. Under the current system, banks are free to lend as much as they want. But higher education officials said they feared that more direct Federal involvement might result in more restrictions on how the money is allocated. And they worried that the estimated $1 billion in annual savings would go to other Federal spending, not to more student loans.
 
Restrictions Are Feared
 "My guess is that if they are trying to save money, there may well be restrictions," said Dallas Martin, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, a group representing about 9,000 financial aid officers.
There is widespread agreement that the Federal student loan program needs to be overhauled. In addition to the high rate of defaults and delinquencies, the system is cumbersome, taking weeks and sometimes months to grant students their assistance. Some financial aid officials said the proposal clearly addresses that issue.
"On the surface, it looks pretty good," said Marie Leonard, director of financial aid at Hunter College in New York. "It would put more control in the hands of the schools and would give students a quicker commitment because it would cut down part of the process."
But she and others expressed apprehension over what she called inattention in the proposal to collections and bad debts.
The current structure is a complicated procedure that would take colleges several years to duplicate, if they could even afford to do that, several financial aid officers at colleges and universities said.
In the current system, banks can either sell their loans to other banks or institutions for investment purposes, or let the college or university hold the loans in its own portfolio. Financial institutions also have created networks of collection agencies and hired workers to pursue those who do not repay their student loans.
Several colleges and universities flatly said they hoped a more specific Federal proposal would not require them to supply those services, because they cannot afford it.

HEADLINE: Hope and Realities;
Dinkins Address Expresses Optimism At Odds With Troubles Faced by City

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's assessment of the state of his city had at its essence an optimism for the future at odds with the harsh realities of the present.
In short, Mr. Dinkins's address was more remarkable for what it did not say than for what it did about the state of City Hall these days. Absent was any description of probable changes among the Mayor's senior aides intended to shore up his political support and impose order on his unruly, uneven and still hard-pressed staff. 
 He spoke of working closely with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo at a moment when relations between the two officials are as strained by their mutural budget crises as they have ever been. He praised "new partnerships" with the City Council as evidence that not all New Yorkers are fractious at a time of the most fractious relations between a mayor and a Council in years.
 
'Right Down to the Bone'
 To be sure, the Mayor took grim note of the city's deepening fiscal problems, warning that services would shrink and that "we will, in fact, cut right down to the bone, and all New Yorkers will feel the pain." And it is an established mayoral prerogative to accentuate the positive in a not-always annual summing up that is not even required by law.
But even as the Mayor acknowledged the crime that has plagued the city's streets and killed too many of its children, he boasted about the diversity of his government and his city's place as "the world's economic command post," and sketched an expansive vision of the future. "This administration will take whatever measures may be necessary to guarantee that we retain the freedom to reach for our dreams, to preserve our ability to overcome whatever disappointments may come our way."
Mr. Dinkins closed by lauding the spirit of the average New Yorker and presenting "gorgeous mosaic" awards to six civic-minded citizens, though he had to prompt his audience to applaud them.
 
'A Speech Is a Speech'
 Not everyone in City Hall shared the Mayor's apparent confidence.
"When you listen to David Dinkins, you really feel his heart is in the right place," said City Council President Andrew J. Stein, who has said he might run for mayor in 1993. "But this is the time for forceful and decisive action and movement, and he has to take it over the next year. A speech is a speech, but he has to act boldly and decisively."
Even as he spoke in such encouraging generalities, some of the Mayor's senior advisers and longtime supporters said they expected staff changes at high levels in the coming weeks as the year-old administration strives to adjust itself to confront the problems ahead.
A number of people close to Mr. Dinkins's chief political aide, Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, have asserted forcefully in recent days that Mr. Lynch was deeply unhappy in his job and, with the city's bleak economic prospects has been seriously considering leaving. But Mr. Lynch, who just returned from his first vacation in years, denied that he had any plans to leave.
 
'Not in the Best of Shape'
 Even the suggestion that Mr. Lynch might leave was a sign of the pessimism of some members of Mr. Dinkins's electoral coalition, and enough to disturb others.
The Rev. Calvin O. Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, said of the city and the Dinkins administration, "I think both are not in the best of shape." But he said many of the Mayor's problems were inherited and added that he was still a strong supporter, though he said Mr. Lynch's departure would be "a disaster."
"If Bill's not there, there would be some serious questions as to whether Calvin Butts would be there," he said.
It seems almost certain that John Flateau, a former Dinkins campaign aide, will come to City Hall to serve as chief of staff, in charge of the Mayor's schedule and the cadre of too many cooks that has kept Mr. Dinkins complaining that his office does not run as smoothly as it should.
 
Jobs and Attention
 Other senior aides said discussions were also under way with Charles McKinney, an aide to Representative Charles B. Rangel, to supervise the Mayor's political and patronage-dispensing efforts. Party leaders have complained that the Dinkins administration has not rewarded them or their loyalists with enough jobs or attention.
Still undecided is the precise role of Ken Sunshine, a senior special adviser to the Mayor, who had run the scheduling operation from a desk outside the Mayor's suite but has now shifted to work on political and lobbying projects under the aegis of Mr. Lynch from an office across the street.
"First years are always difficult for any leader," said the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, a longtime Dinkins ally. "This year, for this Mayor, has really been trial by fire. The level of public anxiety about all the things that are wrong in their lives, many of which are not under the Mayor's control, makes the focus on municipal leadership intense."
Ms. Messinger added: "My conclusion is that to have spent a year like that as your first year as New York City's Mayor means that you've bumped into a couple of walls, and you have a real need to try to expand long-range planning, do more consultation and insure that all of the hands and heads of your government are working in concert. And I think that's very much on the Mayor's agenda."

HEADLINE: Mideast Crisis Threatens Unlikely Victim: Junk Mail

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
The prospect of war in the Persian Gulf may have one unlikely beneficiary: the nation's overstuffed mailboxes. Many direct marketing consultants say they are advising their clients to postpone plans to send out junk mail until after Jan. 15, the date when the United Nations has authorized the use of force to end Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
January is normally a peak month for mailing magazine subscription solicitations, catalogues and sweepstakes. But the consultants say they are deferring to a debated piece of direct marketing folklore that originated on Nov. 22, 1963, the day President Kennedy was assassinated: Never send junk mail into the face of a national crisis, or you risk losing your customers to the television screen. 
 "I advised all my clients to get their mail out by the end of the year, or hold the mail in the bags to see if war starts on the 16th," said Richard V. Benson, a circulation expert. "If war does start, I'm telling them to hold until Feb. 1." said Mr. Benson, who founded the University of California, Berkeley Wellness Letter, the nation's largest medical newsletter, with a circulation of 900,000.
Far from all direct marketers abide by the crisis theory, and some even cite cases that they say disprove it. But enough marketers believe the theory that the the result is likely to be fewer of the "Dear Reader" solicitations and "you'll be the envy of all the folks in Fair Lawn" come-ons that typically flood into homes this time of year.
Katie Muldoon, the chief executive of HDM Muldoon, a direct-marketing subsidiary of the HDM Worldwide advertising company, said she had told many of her clients, which include General Mills and Colgate-Palmolive, to delay their mailings.
"Historically, what we've seen with national events like this is that people watch their television sets and don't read their mail," she said. But even if war breaks out, she said marketers would only have to postpone their mailings for two to four weeks.
"The American public doesn't have too much of an attention span," Ms. Muldoon said.
The situation in the Middle East is running right into another crisis facing direct marketers, a 25 percent increase in the cost of third-class postage, the Postal Service's category for junk mail. That increase is expected to be approved in late January and go into effect on Feb. 3.
The the near-certainty of a postal-rate increase and the possibility of Persian Gulf hostilities have generated a raging debate among the direct marketers who send some 62 billion packages each year. Many argue that war -- like snow, rain, heat and gloom of night -- should not stop the mail.
 
California Earthquake
 "We mailed into the California earthquake," said Jerome W. Pickholz, the chairman of Ogilvy & Mather Direct and an advocate of continued mailings. "Anybody who mails regularly is bound to mail into a disaster."
Indeed, magazine publishers must maintain the circulation rate-base they guarantee advertisers, so they are forced to continue mailing despite uncertainty. And many of the most prolific direct marketers, like Publishers Clearing House, could not stop their enormous mailings even if they wanted, because they are tied into tight schedules of television and print advertising. That means would-be millionaires eagerly awaiting the prize drawings later this month are not wasting their baited breath.
But many smaller or more flexible marketers, including some catalogue merchandisers and others who were planning small test mailings, rather than mass mailings, are postponing their trips to the post office.
One large mailing house, Mailmen Inc. in Hauppauge, L.I., says it is holding roughly half of the two million solicitations it was planning to send for its clients this month until the storm clouds in the Middle East either burst or clear.
 
History as a Guide
 Those direct marketers who believe the timing is bad cite history as their guide.
"The famous example is President Kennedy's assassination," recalled John Francis Tighe, a consultant in Truro, Mass., who has worked for American Express and Hearst Magazines. "It occurred when people were just mailing out for the Christmas holidays. It had just gone into the mail and was scheduled to hit around Thanksgiving. A great deal of the mailing just died. It was quite an economic hardship on a lot of mailers."
Holiday gift-giving has traditionally made December the heaviest month for most categories of junk mail. But for financial services, entertainment and home furnishings, January has run a close second in many recent years, according to the Kleid Company, a New York direct marketing firm.
 
'The Me Month'
 No one really knows the reason for the popularity of January, which some direct marketers call "the me month." As direct marketing experts are fond of saying, they are more comfortable with the what's than the why's.
"There's a lot of direct mail mythology," said Eli Spielman, a Teaneck, N.J., consultant who creates packages for Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover and who supports the idea of deferred mailings this month.

HEADLINE: THE NEW ISRAELIS: A SPECIAL REPORT;
Soviet Influx Has the Israelis Building, Fighting and in Awe

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TEL AVIV, Jan. 4

 BODY:
Israel has become a nation consumed, not with the prospect of war in the gulf, but with the extraordinary wave of Soviet Jewish immigration that is altering the face of Israeli society.
Nearly as many Soviet Jews have arrived in the last year as arrived in the 41 years since independence in 1948. In their numbers, their skills and their politics, those immigrants -- nearly 200,000 since the end of 1989 -- are changing life here in ways that are exhilarating for Israelis, and also difficult for them to understand. 
 But virtually all Israelis, from politicians of the left and right to ordinary citizens, remain bewitched by the wave of immigration. They are awed by its dimension and confident that when all is said and done, it will bring strength, wealth and increased weight to Israel as a nation and as a military power in the Middle East.
"Per capita, it's as if the United States were to absorb France," said Amikam Oren, general manager of the Israeli Housing Ministry, which expects immigrants to pour in at the rate of 40,000 to 50,000 over the next few months as long as the Soviet Union keeps its doors open to those who wish to leave.
With all the joy and anticipation, there are questions about the speed with which Israel is moving to make housing available to the rushing waves of immigrants, and there are increasingly critical newspaper and television accounts about the fighting between Housing Ministry and Absorption Ministry officials, between religious and secular authorities and between the various political parties that evidently surround the Israeli effort to greet newcomers.
This year alone the number of arrivals is expected to be a record 400,000 Soviet Jews, more than double that of last year. For the first time in its history, Israel has an immigration budget that is larger than its military budget.
Nowhere is the extent of the wave more evident than at Ben-Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv.
There, travelers from other countries landing in Israel appear to be a drop in a sea of largely Soviet Jewish immigrants standing amid an awesome pile of battered suitcases loaded on trolleys. Those Soviet Jews, who have spent days or weeks making their way to Israel, appear anxious. They peer across the arrival hall, looking to make a phone call to a distant relative or waiting for the Absorption Ministry authorities to greet them, finish their paper work and send them on to a new home if no relatives are there to take them away.
"It's amazing," said Judith Kipper, a Middle East expert at the Brookings Institution who is studying the influx. "You get to Tel Aviv and there they are in the hundreds standing with their luggage. Then in just a few hours they all disappear, just melting away."
Where they wind up, and their future plans, political and social, have become pivotal and nagging questions.
Many Israeli Jews of European descent, the Ashkenazim, say they are looking to the Soviet Jews to redress what they see as an imbalance that has tilted the weight of Israel's Jewish population toward the Sephardim, or Middle Eastern Jews. Many of the Ashkenazim say that change has affected their way of life by increasing the dominance of the rigorously observant religious parties over Israeli culture, politics and religious affairs.
The numbers of newcomers alone portend a sweeping shift in Israeli political life. At the end of 1989, the Central Bureau of Statistics put Israel's Jewish population at 3.7 million. About 1.3 million of those were counted as Ashkenazim, and 1.6 million were counted as Sephardim. The rest were listed as Jews born to Israeli-born fathers, but considered neither Ashkenazim nor Sephardim by Israel.
If Government projections for the influx on Soviet Jews hold true, as many as a million more Ashkenazim could arrive by the end of 1992.
Israel's Arab population, which excludes the Palestinians living in the occupied territories, is put at 700,000.
 
The Immigrants
 
Who They Are, Why They Came
Dr. Nodari Pichkhadze, a silver-haired dermatologist from Soviet Georgia who arrived here three months ago, pulled his 5-year-old to his lap and proclaimed with a smile, "Meir here wants to be President."
The 50-year-old doctor said he had dreamed of coming here since he was 18. "I am a good physician," he said, sitting quietly in his new apartment in a Tel Aviv suburb. "I don't want to be rich and I am not particularly religious. I am Jewish. My family is Jewish, and the future of my children is here. That is why I came."
Dr. Mikhail Zusman, a 30-year-old physicist who came a year ago from Kharkov in the Ukraine to live and work at Beersheba said Israelis would have to wait and see before a solid body of opinion identified with the Russian Jews emerged on the political scene.
"Generally speaking, the movement from the Soviet Union to here is one from the left to the right," he said. "But all I can say for now is that I have not made up my mind about the political situation. I feel this country is my mother country. This is the main conclusion I can give you, but the problems connected with Arab territories, et cetera, are very big problems that I am ready to deal with and maybe my generation will not see them resolved."
Other Russians, like Vladimir Shklyar, a fencing instructor from Leningrad who has been here for 11 months and has found a job teaching his sport at Hebrew University, said that most Soviet Jews were escaping the economic and political chaos of the Soviet Union and that their politics in the end would be shaped by how they can serve their well-being here.
"As far as what motivates people to come here, I don't think they are coming driven by the Zionist ideals like in 1949," he said. "They are coming out of fear of pogroms and because of economic reasons. But once you are here you begin to explore your Jewish roots and background and you look at the traditon."
Sitting in his modestly furnished two-bedroom apartment in Jerusalem, Mr. Shklyar did not appear optimistic about the Palestinian question.
"If there is going to be peace in the region, it will help the absorption to work out," he said.
 
The Reaction
 
Changing View Of Israeli Life
The dimension of the challenge of the immigration is evident in conversations with almost every Israeli. There is unanimous exhilaration at the notion that this country is watching its population grow by more than 25 percent in the space of three years or so.
"From the East and West, from Persia and Ethiopia, from Bukhara and Samarkand, and from Moscow and Kishinev, the Jews are coming to the only country that wants them and is waiting for them," said Consul General Aryeh Levin as he raised the Israeli flag above Israel's Consulate in Moscow on Thursday.
The influx is changing Israel's perception of many aspects of life here, from its electoral system to its perception of its dispute with Arabs over the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and its 40-year conflict with the Arab nations around it.
Meron Benvenisti, an Israeli specialist on the Palestinian issue who has warned for years that even before the influx, Israel was in the process of absorbing the occupied territories, said the arrival of the Russian Jews had settled the issue.
"Israel is totally absorbed by the immigration of one million Jews," he said. "It couldn't care less about the Palestinians. They are totally beside the point, which is something the Arabs don't seem to understand. It is not important whether the Soviet Jews will go in West Bank settlements or not. What is important is that they will eventually join the army and patrol the West Bank. This wave means another 100,000 people in the Army of Israel."
That apprehension is shared by the Palestinians living here. Sari Nusseibah, a prominent Palestinian leader in Jerusalem, said in a recent interview: "As long as there is no clear indication of a peace process or any intention of the Israelis to end their occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, immigration is a terrifying prospect because what it tells Palestinians is that we cannot live as equals in this country and that the chances of preserving our Palestinian lands in the West Bank and Gaza for a Palestinian state are getting slimmer by the day."
 
The Housing
 
Construction And Infighting
 Arieh Bar, director of the Housing Ministry for the Negev region, sat in the wind-swept ministry building in Beersheba, the capital of the Negev, speaking of the dream of Israel's founder, David Ben-Gurion, coming true on the maps hanging on his office's wall.
In a contradictory twist, not too far away bulldozers are moving mounds of earth as hundreds of largely Arab workers are putting up prefabricated and new houses for the Jews coming to Israel. "We are going to change this area from a peripheral one to a central area, which was Ben-Gurion's dream," said Mr. Bar, a 45-year-old Iraqi-born Jew who came here in 1949. "Two years ago the whole Negev region received $4.5 million in development money. Today my budget for development is $115 million. Infrastructure planning projects were valued at $500,000 then, and today we are spending $20 million on planning for more in the future."
Leonid Wenkret, one of Mr. Bar's aides, pointed at a barren desert lot called Ramot, teeming with construction workers, and said, "if we go according to our assumptions, we will triple the population in the Negev" from 240,000 in four to seven years.
"Without doubt we are witnessing a historical landmark that can be compared in the history of the Jewish people to the establishment of Israel itself," Mr. Bar said. "This country will go from a Jewish population of 3.8 million to perhaps 6, or who knows, 7 million people. We must succeed. It is like a mission. As someone who came from an Arab country, to me, this, more than anything else, will establish in front of the Arab world the fact that Israel is here to stay."
To accomplish that, Israel is racing to construct housing, using everything from prefabricated concrete blocks to what Israelis call caravan cities, which are a collection of trailers without wheels put in empty lots lent by the army or given by the state or volunteered by existing Kibbutzims.
As the construction boom gets under way, so does the infighting among competing politicians, most particularly Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz and Housing Minister Ariel Sharon. And there are already accusations of corruption in the allocation of funds to contractors, although many of them are hard to prove.
Among other things it has laid the fundamental conflict between religious and secular parties. Mr. Peretz, an Orthodox Jew, asserted recently that many of those coming were not even Jews and should have their religious credentials examined. His remark shocked may secular Jews eager for the Soviet influx to go smoothly and to tilt the balance in this country, again, in favor of the secularists.
A few days ago, Mr. Peretz said the Housing Ministry's caravan program was not enough to house the Soviet Jews and called for the purchase and installment of thousands of tents, warning that even with new immigrants living two or three families to an apartment, Israel may be short of housing for some 100,000 newcomers this year.
 
The Homeless
 
Rising Ranks Of the Displaced
 In contrast to the mood in Beersheba, where thousands of housing units are nonetheless being built for the immigrants, there is bitterness at a tent settlement in Jerusalem that houses some of those displaced or shunted aside as a result of the Soviet influx.
On a damp, barren hill beneath the ultramodern Museum of Israel, Sima Maman, a 24-year-old unemployed Israeli woman of Moroccan descent, also talks of the Soviet influx.
Standing inside a tent that serves as temporary home to her 2 1/2-year-old daughter and her husband, a tent pitched in the middle of 22 other tents devoted to homeless native-born Israeli families, Mrs. Maman can barely disguise her anger at being evicted from her apartment because she no longer can afford rising rents, driven up by the new demand for housing for the Soviet wave arriving here.
"I have nothing against the immigrants, but I ask for a solution," she said, standing in her dim and poorly heated tent. "They get a year's worth of subsidy the day they arrive, so they can afford to pay $500 rents. What did they do for Israel to deserve it. I served in the army. My husband served. I was born here. I have rights here, but look at the way I live."
Dede Ben-Shitrit is an elected member of the Jerusalem City Council and a campaigner for a volunteer group that cares for the Sephardim, or Middle Eastern Jews, who have been displaced because their small incomes cannot keep up with the rise in housing costs here.
He said there were 70,000 homeless families in Israel.
"I think the immigrants will be next here in those tents once they run out of subsidies from the state," he said.
 
The Jobs
 
A Problem On the Way?
The problems of absorption become particularly complicated when it comes to finding jobs for the newcomers, many of whom are educated but are heavily concentrated in professions like medicine, engineering, music and the arts, fields where Israel already has a plentiful supply.
Israel's most serious problem may be money to support the immigrants and to expand the economy. The Absorption Ministry's 1991 plan suggests that based on patterns of the 400,000 arrivals estimated for 1990, 15.3 percent may be over the age of 60 and therefore will become a net drain on the state's economy and welfare system.
Herman Branover, a professor of physics at the University of Ben-Gurion at Beersheba, said the caliber of Soviet engineers coming in was quite high compared with other professions like medicine, and as such they are a welcome addition.
But he wondered whether jobs could be found for the thousands of engineers, doctors and musicians showing up in Israel every month.
"Even if we established a symphony orchestra in every village we couldn't absorb all the musicians that are pouring in," he said.
To help, Professor Branover, who came from the Soviet Union in 1972, urged the Israeli private sector and Government to multiply the number of high-technology projects and private-sector companies that it has to absorb the new engineering talents. He has established a new Soviet-Israeli venture laboratory for energy problems in the University of Ben-Gurion in Beersheba, in which he has employed a dozen of the new scientists and physicists who came over the last year.
He has also founded the Ofakim Technology Center to spin off private-sector high-tech companies, for the 15 percent of the immigrants estimated to carry degrees in engineering and are unlikely to find employment in existing companies in Israel.
It is far too early to tell whether Israel will have a serious problem in making jobs available to its newcomers. But the problem does not appear to be immediate for two reasons.
Virtually all those who arrive in Israel receive a generous stipend for living that carries them for a year. It averages $1,000 a month for a family of three. And many are already refocusing their skills in related fields, and the Soviet immigrants, by and large, have proved to be a resourceful lot, with many relatives who appear more than willing to help.
Though he conceded he had had an easier time than others, Dr. Pichkhadze, whose wife is a music teacher, said his sister, who has lived here for 18 years, obtained the two-bedroom apartment where he lives almost as soon as he arrived.
With the stipend he gets from the Government, he could afford the rent, and his two daughters and son will receive schooling for free.
"All I need to do is learn the language," he said. "With my 20 years' experience and many relatives who are doctors, I am 100 percent confident I will find a job. Maybe other, younger doctors will have problems but this country seems to be like a sponge. Will it absorb all these people? I guess so. They say they can absorb two million."
Asked what he thought of the problems of the Sephardim native Israeli Jews who are showing up in tents as they lose their apartments to the higher rents that immigrants like him can pay with Government subsidies, Dr. Pichkhadze said: "We are not getting anything for free. We will have to pay everything with our sweat. I feel some sympathy for those people, but right now everyone is paying a price."
 
The Politics
 
Wooing Voters In a New Arena
On Thursday, Israelis were amused to learn from the television that former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the oppositiosn Labor Party, was learning Russian, presumably because the Labor Party hopes to attract many of the immigrants to its ranks.
Although much has been made of the fact that most of the new Soviet immigrants would be leaning to the right, it is far from clear yet what political convictions the arriving Soviet Jews hold and how those convictions will change when they consider issues like Palestinian nationalism, war with Iraq, and the Arab-Israeli conflict.
What is clear is that for most, Israel is something of an invulnerable force capable to standing up to any challenge, a place that is much safer than the Soviet homeland they came from.
David Kreizelman, director of the visiting journalists department of Israel's Government press office, said, "They have a somewhat mythical sense of Israel's strength."

HEADLINE: Ever Elusive, O'Neill Left His Mark

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 8

 BODY:
William A. O'Neill will leave office on Wednesday having served longer than any Connecticut governor in 180 years. Yet even after a full decade on the state's highest public stage, he remains an elusive figure, and even some of the people he is closest to say they do not know him very well.
His gaffes with the language, his stiff public manner and modest, even self-effacing style all veiled what friends and associates said was a powerful intellect seldom glimpsed by the public or the political opponents who disparaged and sometimes made fun of him. 
 In private, Mr. O'Neill, a Democrat, is said to be a witty man capable of discussing the nuances of 17th-century European history. In public he was more noted for his malapropisms and fumbles, as when he congratulated the Trumbull Little League team for "returning the World Series championship to the United States after six years of abstinence"; or, commenting on the arts, said, "I enjoy some Shakespeare, but I also enjoy plays."
The achievements of his long career have similarly been clouded by a turn of fortune that has dumped Connecticut on the doorstep of a budget crisis and a recession in Mr. O'Neill's final months. According to the most recent opinion surveys, conducted just before the November election by the University of Connecticut, more than 70 percent of the 522 people interviewed thought he had done only a fair or poor job in office. Only 2 percent said he had been an excellent governor.
As his popularity slipped last year, he decided not to seek another term.
 
Broad Changes in Government
 Mr. O'Neill, however, is leaving Connecticut's government vastly changed from what he found on Dec. 31, 1980, when as a 50-year-old Lieutenant Governor he grimly took the oath of office to replace Gov. Ella T. Grasso, who had just resigned and was dying of cancer.
In size alone, the state budget bears Mr. O'Neill's stamp: It increased from $3 billion in 1981 to a projected $8 billion for the fiscal year that begins on July 1. The state also had to take on huge new responsibilities in regulation and administration as the Federal Government's role in state affairs receded under President Reagan. The road and bridge system was rebuilt. An expansion of the prison system was begun.
Asked in an interview, however, how he hoped to be remembered, Mr. O'Neill mentioned none of those things.
"I would like, certainly, to be remembered as an honest man -- that I was a man of very high integrity," he said.
 
Judgment of History
 Some of those who have watched Mr. O'Neill's career say history will ultimately redeem the Governor, mainly because historians will distill out the quirks of personality and image that seem so prominent now and will lift from his shoulders the blame for some things that were perhaps not his fault, such as the regional economic downturn.
"Ten or twenty years from now, no one will know about those things," Everett C. Ladd, a professor of political science at the University of Connecticut, said of Mr. O'Neill's awkward public persona. "What they'll see is a very decisive record, a strong image that will grow as years go by."
Some senior Democrats and Republicans also say that Mr. O'Neill may ultimately be remembered as the man who helped elect Connecticut's first independent governor since the Civil War, Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
They say that Mr. O'Neill's personal feud last year with his party's nominee for governor, Bruce A. Morrison, almost certainly eroded Mr. Morrison's support and encouraged some Democrats to desert their party for Mr. Weicker's independent candidacy.
 
Criticism of Morrison
 Mr. Weicker, a former Republican Senator who ran under the banner of his own Connecticut Party, beat the Republican, John G. Rowland, by less than 33,000 votes, largely with the help of Democrats, according to surveys conducted after the election.
Mr. Morrison, who was regularly criticized by Mr. O'Neill during the campaign as a candidate who probably could not win, got barely 20 percent of the vote, even though the Democratic Party is the largest in the state.
"I think it was a large factor," Mr. Rowland's former press secretary, Jack R. Goldberg, said of Mr. O'Neill's role.
Mr. O'Neill steadfastly denies trying to swing the governor's race, though he has acknowledged on several occasions that he believes Mr. Weicker's independent administration, with its mix of Democrats and Republicans, is preferable to the purely Republican administration that Mr. Rowland would have brought to Hartford.
 
The Old Rules
 Mr. O'Neill's allies say the Governor's actions toward Mr. Morrison during the campaign reveal the character of a man who came of age in an earlier time, when party elders were respected and party rules obeyed. It was a system that nurtured Mr. O'Neill from his days in the General Assembly as a lawmaker from East Hampton in the 1960's, through his rise as House majority leader, state party chairman, lieutenant governor, and finally, as governor.
"The Governor lived by certain rules in politics," said John F. Droney Jr., the state Democratic Party chairman. "One of those rules was that you never challenge a sitting incumbent."
When Mr. Morrison openly challenged Mr. O'Neill, who had planned to run for third term, the Governor could not forgive or forget, Mr. Droney said.
"He saw it as a mortal sin," Mr. Droney said. The Governor withdrew from the race for re-election in March as his popularity fell.
Yet Mr. O'Neill professes no bitterness and -- as he has said throughout his career -- no regrets about the path not taken.
 
Sad and Joyous
 "It's a relief, to be quite frank," he said of his final days in office. "It's a sad time also, but it's a joyous time. It's a combination of everything, like any kind of phase that you might go through in your life."
Mr. O'Neill's departure ends a chapter for Connecticut's Democrats, who have ruled the governor's office here for 36 of the last 40 years. He may also represent the last in a long line of Connecticut governors who have stood firm and fast against the introduction of a state income tax on wages.
Mr. Weicker has said that an income tax may ultimately prove inevitable, and that in any event the issue is now one of practical economic and fiscal considerations rather than deep-seated political dogma. A Democrat selected by Mr. Weicker as his top budget adviser, William J. Cibes Jr. -- long an O'Neill stalwart himself over the years -- openly favors taxing wages as a fairer and more workable system of raising revenue.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
String of Dow Losses: Sign of an Off Year?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
With worries growing that no peaceful resolution is possible in the Mideast, the stock market has gotten off to its second-worst start in history.
Only in 1978, when a plunging dollar and fears of rampant inflation were scaring investors, has the Dow Jones industrial average started off on such a downbeat. That year, it fell 5.6 percent in the first five trading days. 
 So far this year, the average is down 4.7 percent, having fallen 124.25 points, to 2,509.41. The Dow lost 13.36 points yesterday, its fifth consecutive decline.
The selloff has been general, with only one Dow stock, Navistar International, showing a gain for the year. The truck manufacturer is up 50 cents, to $2.75 a share, so far.
Some of the worst performers were winners in previous years: Coca-Cola, Philip Morris and Procter & Gamble, the best Dow performers in each of the last two years, have lost more than 5 percent of their value in 1991.
Smaller stocks, which performed far worse than larger stocks last year, have fallen less than the Dow so far in 1991, with the Nasdaq composite off 4 percent and the Russell 2,000 down 3.5 percent.
The declines have come with relatively little institutional selling, and desultory volume.
"You've had the worst possible combination for the brokers, low prices and lower volume," said Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, a stock research concern. "People are selling their large two- or three-year winners, figuring they won't have to pay taxes on the profits until April 15, 1992."
Wall Street's focus on events in the Mideast began in July, when oil prices began to rise as Iraq threatened Kuwait. From its all-time peak of 2,999.75 in mid-July, the Dow declined gradually until a selloff began after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, an act that sent oil prices spiraling upward.
But in the last several months of 1990, other factors drew investors' attention, and there was a lot of hope that a peaceful resolution would be found. Many money managers in private conversations said they thought a war, if it came, would cause a sharp break in prices that would create a buying opportunity, especially if the war ended with a quick American victory.
Instead, as the Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq's withdrawal approached with bellicose talk and no sign of either side backing down, stock prices eroded, without strong selling pressure but with little buying interest. Still, the Dow is 6.1 percent above the low it reached last October.
The 1991 selloff has not been limited to the American market. Since the year began, Japan's Nikkei average of 225 issues is down 4 percent, Britain's FT-SE index 2 percent, and Germany's DAX index 3.2 percent. The German mark has also been especially weak, reacting to rising concerns over both the Mideast and the Soviet Union. Adjusted for currency valuations, German stocks have dropped even further than their American counterparts.
 One longstanding market indicator forecasts that the first five trading sessions of a year serve as an indicator of what kind of year it will be. That indicator has worked in 49 of the 76 years since the Dow was revamped in late 1914, and it would seem to indicate that there is a better than average chance that this will be a bad year.
But the good news for bulls is that the indicator has run into a bad streak in recent years, failing to forecast the direction of the Dow for the rest of the year in 8 of the last 10 years. One of those years in which it failed was 1987, when the Dow rose 5.6 percent in the first five trading days, its third-best start ever. That year continued to look great until October, when the crash wiped out all the gains.
Of the eight years prior to this one that the Dow fell at least 2 percent in the first five trading days, the index managed to rise in the remainer of the year in half the cases, including two years, 1922 and 1955, that saw gains of more than 20 percent.
In 1978, the year the Dow got off to its worst start, prices continued lower for several weeks, but rallied sharply in the spring, and the year ended with the average up 2.6 percent from its level after the first five days.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Dinkin's Speech: 'Forge Ahead'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Mayor David N. Dinkins's State of the City Message:
 Eight months ago, as we nervously surveyed the prospects for a difficult summer, I stood before many of you in this same chamber to urge that you join me in a campaign for harmony, tolerance and understanding. You, and all the people of our city, responded overwhelmingly. 
 Your response lifted us out of a dark season of fear and suspicion and carried us to a brighter day as we discovered in each other a unity of purpose. That sense of brother and sisterhood led us to join hands with Nelson and Winnie Mandela a few weeks later to celebrate the spirit that only freedom can bring. As a result, instead of suffering through a summer of hatred, we reveled in a moment of hope, openness and joy. It is my fondest wish that, before my stewardship is concluded, that moment will come to define the state of our city.
We have begun to create a new kind of government in the past year, a government that draws its strength from the diversity of our people and, in turn, has formed a partnership with them. It is a government that treats each of its citizens fairly, a government that will not abandon a single neighborhood in the shadow. . . .
I have witnessed the strength of our people so many times during the course of this year -- in the compassion of a volunteer providing food to homeless people outside Grand Central Terminal; in the courage of a police officer lying wounded in Kings County Hospital; in the eyes of a young student receiving a diploma at Springfield Gardens High School.
But I have also experienced bitter disappointment; the ever-growing pain of the Federal Government's abandonment of our cities; the violence that stole from us hundreds of our people, so many of them children; an international economic contraction that has forced us to scale back our expectations dramatically.
We will not allow these burdens to limit our vision of the future. This administration will take whatever measures may be necessary to guarantee that we retain the freedom to reach for our dreams, to preserve our ability to overcome whatever disappointments may come our way.
We face difficult obstacles. But in three categories of the public agenda we must not only forge ahead but also win decisive victories: We must maintain our fiscal integrity as we steer our city toward a new era of economic growth; we must guarantee public safety, and we must open the door to the future for our children.
Our economy has contracted at a breathtaking pace, and it shows no sign yet of recovery. Thousands of city employees will lose their jobs in the coming months because the size of our government must fit the size of our rapidly declining economy. However, before we eliminate any essential service, we must first cut out the fat, and we have already begun.
In the future, ours will be a smaller government, but a stronger one, more creative, more productive and more responsive, one able to cope with the rapid changes the rest of this decade will surely bring. And more importantly, it will be our government. By spending no more than we take in, we will maintain our fiscal integrity -- and will avoid losing control to outside monitors. The people of our city elected us to take and make the difficult choices, enlightened by our sensitivity to their needs. We will not seek to escape that responsibility. And until our economy rebounds, we will rely on our resourcefulness to protect those who need help the most.
This is no time for despair. Though our prospects may seem dim at the moment, a rebound is coming, and it will be based on the wealth of resources that we sometimes, in our gloom, overlook.
In a time of economic stress, we must also provide for that most fundamental of civil rights, freedom from fear. We have begun the massive task of redirecting our police force to reinforce our neighborhood-based institutions through the concept of community policing. We anticipate early and favorable action from the Legislature. . . . The legislators know we need the cops, and they share our desire to help our kids through the education, recreation and jobs programs embodied in our plan.
With the police working hand in hand with our communities, we will take back the night and drive away the fear.
We are reaching out to help our neediest children. For many who had no names, we opened nearly 4,000 apartments this year for them and their parents -- permanent, clean and safe places to live -- and we have provided care for 3,900 other homeless families. We will not abandon them.
We must free our children to rise as far as their dreams permit them. We must let them hear the words of Langston Hughes: "O, sweep of stars over Harlem streets, O, little breath of oblivion that is night. Reach up your hand, child, and take a star. Out of the little breath of oblivion that is night, take just one star."
We have made a new beginning. As we pass through difficult times, we will maintain our fiscal stability so that we may assure our children, and all our people, of a safer, healthier tomorrow. We look forward to our journey with optimism, understanding and faith in one another, for we know that we will arrive at a brighter day together.
I thank you for listening.
I thank you for caring.
God bless you all.
Keep the faith.

HEADLINE: Florio's Gamble;
No New Taxes but Talk of Benefits: The Governor Tries Damage Control

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
One year ago, Gov. Jim Florio said his goal was to save the State of New Jersey from what he saw as the failures of his predecessors. This year, both Democrats and Republicans say his goal is to save his party and himself.
 In his State of the State speech tonight, Mr. Florio outlined his plans for a year of political repair work, a time to introduce generally modest programs intended to win back the voters that he alienated last year with a series of tax increases totaling $2.8 billion. 
 But considering the depths of Mr. Florio's political failures in his first year in office, a state economy sliding into recession and a state budget facing as much as a $600 million shortfall, politicians here say his goal of winning back support for Democrats in time for legislative elections in November appears a long shot.
Shortly after taking office last year, Mr. Florio made an unusual political wager: He gambled that a politician who raised taxes to attack the state's most serious problems would be rewarded by voters for his courage. In fact, most politicians here now agree that Mr. Florio grossly misread the public mood in 1990 and overestimated his ability to reach the hearts and minds of average people as they faced increasingly hard times.
 
'The Message Was Too Complex'
 "We all know now that he misjudged the public reaction," said Senator Gabriel M. Ambrosio, a Democrat from Bergen County and a longtime supporter. "Communications were bad. The message was too complex. We never got across that the Governor felt what people were feeling."
In his speech tonight, Mr. Florio offered a host of programs he hopes will have political appeal, including plans to use hundreds of millions of dollars from a state trust fund for new highway construction and the creation of 7,000 new jobs, a $250 million program to help middle-income residents buy their first homes, an end to the state's unpopular system of car inspections, and a savings-bond program to help families send their children to college.
What the proposals have in common is what they are not: They do not raise taxes, they are not controversial, they are modest compared with last year's agenda.
"This is mostly 'mom and apple pie' kind of stuff," Sen. William L. Gormley, a Republican from Atlantic County, said of Mr. Florio's announcements. "He is trying to soften his negatives. It might work over three years. I have trouble believing he can undo everything in one year."
 
Hoping for Appreciation
 In his first six months in office last year, Mr. Florio proposed and the Legislature approved bills that raised the sales and income taxes, banned assault weapons and overhauled the state's auto insurance system. This year, the administration hopes that some voters will come to appreciate benefits from those programs, including property-tax rebates and a promised 20 percent reduction in automobile insurance premiums.
But other factors make it an uphill struggle for Mr. Florio and the Democrats to convince voters to re-elect Democratic majorities in the Legislature, particularly in the Assembly, where the Democratic majority is precarious.
First is the powerful negative image Mr. Florio conveyed to the public last year: a man who would not listen as he pursued policies that many people did not understand. Many supporters, including some in his administration, blame his poor communications for losing the support of all but one in five voters.
It took weeks after the tax package was passed last year, for example, for the administration to release a chart showing that only 17 percent of New Jerseyans would pay higher income taxes. By then, many moderate-income residents were furious about a program that Mr. Florio said was designed to benefit them.
 
Seeming Refusal to Listen
 Perhaps more important, Republican critics say, is that Mr. Florio assumed that the public was willing to trust government to ease its burdens, when, in fact, it was more likely that government would be distrusted and blamed.
Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for the United States Senate who rode anti-tax sentiment to a near victory against Senator Bill Bradley in November, said that Mr. Florio had offended voters not just by raising taxes but by appearing to refuse to listen. Mrs. Whitman said that his promise tonight to shrink the number of state government departments would probably be met with distrust unless it were accompanied by an outside audit.
In addition, even though Mr. Florio said tonight that New Jersey would weather the recession better than its neighbors because of the effort to balance the budget with increased taxes last year, the worsening economy is expected to force him to lay off thousands of state workers and bring accusations from Republicans that the taxes have only made matters worse.
With economists predicting sharp rises in unemployment this year, Mr. Florio may find it even harder to explain to suburban voters why he pushed a tax program that shifted hundreds of millions of dollars from suburbs to poor city school districts.
 
Democrats Demand Revision
 Powerful evidence of the unease among Democrats about the Florio tax package came this week, when the Democratic President of the Senate, John A. Lynch, proposed shifting $450 million designated for poorer school districts to a new program of property tax relief aimed foremost at suburban homeowners.
In explaining their proposal today, Mr. Lynch and the Senate Majority Leader, Daniel J. Dalton, said that the Florio program, which they voted for, was ill-conceived as passed. Implicit in their statements was the threat that if Mr. Florio did not revise the program sufficiently, they would force him to.
Nonetheless, Democratic legislators argue that if the recession turns out to be relatively mild and if the benefits Mr. Florio promised last year are delivered to voters, the party could see an upturn in its fortunes.
"A year is an awfully long time in politics," Senator Ambrosio said. "A year ago we were on top of the world. Look at how quickly things can change."

HEADLINE: With Tight Budgets, Dinkins and Florio Speak of Hope;
Florio Promises Jobs, Not Higher Taxes, To Help Economy

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Faced with both recession and voters' hostility, Gov. Jim Florio tonight outlined a 1991 agenda centered on a jobs program to be fueled by new state construction projects and mortgage help for first-time homebuyers.
The Governor, who pushed through the biggest tax increase in New Jersey history just seven months ago, told the state's disgruntled voters that New Jersey could not "tax its way out of a troubled economy." 
 Instead, in his annual State of the State Message, he outlined a program to create some 7,000 new jobs through an expanded program of state highway and related construction to be financed from existing trust funds that are not included in the state's operating budget.
He also unveiled an agreement with the Federal National Mortgage Association that would provide $250 million in reduced-cost mortgages for "middle-class, first-time" homebuyers. That, he said, would help "jump start" the sagging economy and create new jobs by spurring new homebuilding, which is at a near standstill.
 
After Turbulent Year
 But even as he outlined objectives of his administration, the Governor also took pains to defend the actions of the past year, the most turbulent for a New Jersey governor since Brendan T. Byrne began the state income tax in 1977.
"Nineteen ninety, to say the least, wasn't a year for the fainthearted," Mr. Florio told a joint session of the Legislature and a statewide television audience.
"There was," he conceded, "a lot of controversy, much of it because we had to raise taxes."
He had, he said, "moved much faster than many people were prepared to move," and he also conceded that there was "some truth" to suggestions that "we didn't explain what we did as well as we could."
 
Criticism From G.O.P.
 He was interrupted by applause 48 times by the audience, which consisted of people invited by Mr. Florio and the legislative leaders.
Republican leaders were less generous. The Assembly minority leader, Garabed Haytaian of Hackettstown, said the Governor had failed to achieve the political initiative that he had sought.
"The people won't accept it," he said. "He didn't talk about what's on everybody's mind, and that's a $2.8 billion tax increase."
The Senate minority leader, John H. Dorsey of Mountain Lakes, also said the Governor's glancing reference to the tax increase would alienate voters.
"Bill Bradley learned that," he said, referring to the Senator's cliff-hanger victory in November, which he conceded had resulted from his refusal to discuss taxes.
But the Governor, as he has for the last seven months, insisted that his $2.8 billion tax increase, derived from a one-cent increase in the sales tax and higher income tax rates for the state's highest-earning residents, were both necessary and farsighted.
"The steps we took prepare us to move ahead to make 1991 a year where we deliver on the promises of 1990 and find new ways to make life better for our people."
The Governor leavened his address with personal allusions.
Saying he knows that "a lot of people are worried about the future," he invoked the example of "a young couple I know -- Greg and Ann."
Both work, he said, they have "two lovely children," and they have just bought an "old house that needs lots of fixing up."
"Their lives are a constant juggling of work schedules and child care," he said, and "late at night, when the kids are asleep they spend their little spare time painting the upstairs."
"Greg happens to be my son" he said, "but he could be anyone's son," and "He's nervous about the future. Who wouldn't be?"
Mr. Florio also referred to several other famillies across the state with whom he has held widely publicized "fireside chats" aimed at defusing anger over the tax increases.
These families voiced concerns over mounting college costs, educational quality, recession, shaky retirement prospects and other questions, the Governor said.
 
'I'm Not Buying That!'
 "In New Jersey," he insisted, "we're prepared with the answers." And in a combative note in a basically conciliatory address, Mr. Florio said, "The prophets of doom and gloom want to hang out a sigh that says, 'Welcome to hard times.' "
"Well, I'm not buying that!" he said. "As far as I'm concerned they can hang that sign someplace else."
"Because in New Jersey we worked too hard last year to make this state a good place to live."
The Governor said the state's credit rating was "No. 1 in the nation" and insisted that "businesses are moving in."
He gave only one proposal stemming from the findings transmitted to the Governor so far during a sweeping audit of state government functions, saying only that "Our Audit Commission is showing us ways to save money."
The one item was an announcement that, in line with a commission recommendation, the state will scrap its government-operated system of free automobile safety inspections and instead contract with private companies to make the inspections, possibly for a fee. Mr. Florio's aides said details would be announced on Wednesday.
The Governor also renewed a pledge that insurance reform in the state would eliminate a $220 surcharge to pay for the state's discontinued system of paying claims for high-risk drivers and again insisted that property tax increases would stop and "homestead rebates will go up for hundreds of thousands of people."
 
Tuition Assistance
 As part of a continuing and long-delayed effort to revitalize Atlantic City, Mr. Florio said he would go there on Wednesday to discuss efforts to turn the city's airport into a "world-class" airport. It is expected that he will announce that the state is buying the airport from the city, in an effort to make the airport more attractive for a major air carrier to provide expanded service.
He also pledged to push legislation that would help with college tuition for middle-income families through the issuing of discounted savings bonds to build a nest egg for college and through loans of up to $5,000 a year at "fixed, reasonable rates."
He also promised continued efforts to enforce the state's 7-year-old death penalty law, under which no one has been executed but which he has maintained is frustrated by lengthy court challenges that make executions all but impossible, to "double our current resources for child care" and to replace the state's expensive health care fund for uninsured hospital patients, which expired at the end of the year, with a new, more efficient and less expensive system.
And while he pledged to pare down and streamline state government, in part by combining the functions of some of the 19 administrative departments, he provided no details of how that would be done, saying instead that proposals would be announced soon.

HEADLINE: Urban League Urges Action

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The National Urban League today urged action by the Bush Administration and Congress to stimulate the economy, saying black Americans were in a "permanent recession" and would bear the brunt of hard economic times.
In its 16th annual report on the state of black America, the civil rights organization also urged passage of civil rights legislation introduced in Congress last week. 
 "We are already in an economic slowdown," the organization's president, John E. Jacob, said at a news conference, "but African-Americans have been in a permanent recession.
"We had double-digit unemployment rates throughout the supposedly good times of the 1980's, and past experience shows that in a nationwide recession the racial gap in employment becomes wider and more severe. So I urge the Administration and the Congress to do whatever is necessary to prevent a prolonged recession, and to insure that the burdens of a downturn do not widen the terrible racial and class divisions in our society."
Democratic Party leaders in Congress have begun talking about anti-recessionary programs, like greater spending for highway construction, to stem unemployment. But President Bush said in a recent television interview he would veto such a measure.
Writing in the league's report, David H. Swinton, dean of the School of Business at Jackson State University in Mississippi, said, "If this downturn has an impact similar to the last few recessions, African-Americans will bear a disproportionate share of its hardships."
Quoting Census Bureau figures, Dr. Swinton said blacks receive about three-fifths as much income per person as whites and are three times as likely to have annual incomes below the Federally defined poverty level of $12,675 for a family of four.
The report also said the American military deployment in the gulf could lead to racial inequality, with blacks paying a greater cost than whites in lost lives and lost leadership.
Mr. Jacob said Mr. Bush must prepare for his re-election campaign "in the context of trying to lead the world in a moral crusade against aggression, a crusade that rests on the power of our armed forces, almost half of whom are black, Hispanic or women."

HEADLINE: With Tight Budgets, Dinkins and Florio Speak of Hope;
Dinkins Sees Rebound But Offers Few Details To Curb Fiscal Woes

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
As his administration grappled with New York City's most serious fiscal problems since the mid-1970's, Mayor David N. Dinkins offered a message of hope in his first State of the City address, but provided few indications of how the administration would master its budget woes.
"This is no time for despair," Mr. Dinkins said in a speech before hundreds of elected officials and invited guests in the City Council Chamber. "Though our prospects may seem dim at the moment, a rebound is coming, and it will be based on the wealth of resources that we sometimes, in our gloom, overlook." 
 In his 32-minute speech, Mr. Dinkins repeatedly talked of the hope, openness, joy, courage and the heroism he has seen in individual New Yorkers. He said the city needs to look to a brighter future, beyond the current recession that has seen city revenues fall and demands grow for social services for the poor.
 
Preserving Fiscal Stability
 He also called for strengthening laws for juveniles arrested for crimes, to "make sure the punishment fits the crime." He raised the possibility of a march on Washington for stronger gun-control legislation, and called on legislators in Washington and Albany to reduce the mandated programs that increase the city's costs.
In addressing a budget gap that could reach $2.5 billion over the next 18 months, Mr. Dinkins said that the budget would be "cut to the bone" to preserve fiscal stability. He said he wanted to make sure that the State's Financial Control Board, which monitors city finances, does not step in.
But much of his speech was devoted to a recitation of how the city's current adversity could pave the way for a brighter future. He noted that depressed real-estate values here made New York a less expensive place to live in than 40 other cities around the world.
"Because our neighboring states and counties have raised their taxes much faster than ours to solve their own budget problems," Mr. Dinkins said, "no one has to move out of the cultural and commercial capital of the world."
 
Speech Is Not Mandated
 Unlike the President's State of the Union Message or the New York Governor's State of the State Message, the State of City address is not mandated by charter, law or custom. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch started it in 1979, abandoned it in some years, and took it up in others. Mr. Dinkins chose not to deliver the address last year, using his inaugural speech, instead, to present the goals of his administration.
Under Mr. Koch, who governed during an era of rising city tax revenues, the speech, usually delivered in late January, was chock-full of new programs -- sometimes vaguely described -- in areas from the homeless to policing.
Mr. Dinkins chose to deliver the address in early January, a week before the deadline for the submission of a financial plan that will lay out service cuts that have already prompted angry demonstrations at City Hall and firehouses. But with almost no money for new programs, Mr. Dinkins focused on long-term goals and enduring ideals instead.
He ended his address with a Reaganesque touch, citing six city residents, who "have come to the aid of their fellow New Yorkers."
The list included community organizers, bystanders who rescued children from a fire and an advocate for the homeless. The Mayor said that they would receive a mayoral "gorgeous mosaic" award, an allusion to an image Mr. Dinkins often uses to describe New Yorkers' varied ethnic and racial communities.
But as he depicted his vision of the city's future, Mr. Dinkins was unable to summon the former President's common touch. His delivery was earnest, but when he began speaking he found the teleprompter hard to see, and rarely looked up from his papers.
Mr. Dinkins began speaking at 5:04 P.M. at a podium set up in the City Council Chamber, before a backdrop of American and New York City flags. Sixteen palm trees and ferns were trucked in from a Parks Department greenhouse from Forest Park in Woodhaven, Queens, for the occasion.
He received sometimes polite applause 11 times, until the final moments, when he listed the recipients of his "gorgeous mosaic" award. When he paused for applause and none followed, he said, "I think you should applaud them." The speech was broadcast live on five television stations.
 
Notable Absences
 It was Mr. Dinkins's fourth major televised address since his inauguration. Reflecting, perhaps, the lonely and difficult choices a mayor must make, many who cheered Mr. Dinkins at his inauguration were absent.
Many City Council seats were filled by staff members. Borough Presidents Claire Shulman of Queens and Howard Golden of Brooklyn were absent; the City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, was on vacation, and only a handful of the Congressmen and state legislators who were expected were present.
The address came as the Dinkins administration has been preparing hundreds of millions of dollars in budget cuts to close a gap of as much as $2.5 billion over the next 18 months. With so much bad news in the offing, Mr. Dinkins chose to reiterate the administration's achievements.
The speech was written by Albert Scardino, Mr. Dinkins's press secretary, and Maria Laurino, a former writer for The Village Voice, who was hired as Mr. Dinkins's chief speech writer last October.
For months, the administration has been under attack by critics, including Felix G. Rohatyn, the departing chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, who say the administration's response to the fiscal problems has been ambiguous and inconsistent.
Peter F. Vallone, Speaker of the City Council, said the Council would stand beside Mr. Dinkins in his efforts to solve the city's fiscal problems. "This is a very difficult time to make a speech and rally people," he said, "but the Mayor has the best of intentions."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Speech By New Jersey Governor

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Gov. Jim Florio's State of the State Message:
Nineteen ninety, to say the least, wasn't a year for the faint-hearted.
 There was a lot of controversy. Much of it because we had to raise taxes. And that's never easy. We moved much faster than many people were prepared to move. 
 Some say we didn't explain what we did as well as we could. There may be some truth to that.
But the steps we took prepare us to move ahead to make 1991 a year where we deliver on the promises of 1990 and find new ways to make life better for our people. Tonight I stand here proud of New Jersey and its people, proud of what we've done to prepare for our future.
I know a lot of people are worried about that future.
Change is sweeping the world. It's unsettling. A national recession puts prosperity and opportunity to the test. People everywhere want to know: Is government on my side or in my way?
People have a right to ask these questions.
But let me make it very clear. In New Jersey, we're prepared with answers.
Because in New Jersey we worked too hard last year to make this state a good place to live.
We're ready.
We made choices others are just starting to face up to.
In 1991 we're the strongest state in the region.
Our credit rating's No. 1 in the nation.
Businesses are moving in.
We're going to grow, and build and create jobs for people who want to work.
In 1990, we laid a firm foundation for 1991. More important, we're ready to deliver on our promises because we listened, and we changed things that needed changing.
We need an inspector general to take aim at corruption and waste.
A state that cracks down on those who pollute our water should do no less with those who steal from our children.
In 1990 we started to take a long overdue look at state government. Our Audit Commission is showing us ways to save money. But it also tells us we can be smarter in the way we do what needs to be done.
So I'm announcing tonight that I've accepted the Audit Commission's recommendation to end the car inspection system as it now exists. We can contract with private firms and do only the air pollution testing that's required by Federal law. We'll sacrifice nothing in safety.
We'll keep in mind two goals.
First, having government as small as it can be and still doing what it has to do.
Second, making sure what we do makes sense -- common sense.
That means government should have the courage to do what it must do and the wisdom to get out of the way when someone else can do it better.
Right now our government is like the fellow who drinks, smokes, eats too much and wonders why his doctor is so upset.
Nineteen ninety was a year when a lot of people got involved. From my office I could hear the drama unfold on the steps of the State House. One day some people would come down and say: spend more money on arts, on the colleges on agriculture.
Another day, another group would come. Just as vocal. Just as committed. But insisting we spend less on everything.
A conflict? Sure. It's called democracy. Sometimes it's loud, sometimes it's messy, but it works.
So let me conclude by stressing again: 1990 was about investing; 1991 is about dividends.
March 17: no more ocean dumping.
April 1: no more J.U.A. surcharge.
July 31: Homestead rebates of up to $500.
Tuition help for the middle class.
Home ownership for more of our people.
A more sensible car inspection system.
Leaner government.
New roads.
And jobs.
Let's all work together; there's a lot to do. We have something good here in New Jersey. Something that is worth keeping.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK EASING CITY WATER RULES

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
Reversing their position, New York State health officials have determined that New York City will be able to guarantee the safety of its drinking water for many years without having to spend billions of dollars to filter it.
The State Health Department had proposed that the city begin filtering the water it receives from six Catskill reservoirs by the year 2005. They supply the city with 90 percent of its water, long viewed as among the best urban supplies in the world. The proposal followed growing concerns about the future purity of water in the Catskill and Delaware reservoir systems as those areas are developed. 
 But after being pressed by the Dinkins administration and environmentalists to change its stand, the Health Department has agreed that the city's legal actions and regulatory proposals to protect the Catskill and Delaware reservoirs from pollution have been sufficient to avoid the need to build expensive filtration plants. They would have cost the city at least $4 billion, plus more than $200 million a year to operate, the city has estimated.
The Dinkins administration has been moving to preserve the high quality of the city's drinking water by measures that include overhauling more than 35 years of pollution regulations for its reservoir systems.
City officials and experts on the environment have asserted that it would be much cheaper to insure pure drinking water by tightening regulations on the use of the reservoirs' watersheds -- the land around them drained by rivers and streams -- than by building filtration plants. Such regulations may involve limiting construction near reservoirs, restricting agricultural practices like the use of chemicals that could pollute reservoirs, and establishing wide buffer zones between streams and farms to reduce polluted runoff.
Many Catskill residents resent the city's power to control land use in their towns. But a state law passed 86 years ago gave the city the authority to take upstate lands and flood them for reservoirs. The same law allows the city to make rules to insure that the drinking water remains pure.
 
Flowing 100 Miles Away
 The city's 18 reservoirs -- 6 in the Catskill and Delaware systems and 12 in Croton -- supply 1.5 billion gallons of water a day. That water flows from as far as 100 miles away through a gravity-fed network of tunnels and aqueducts. Besides New York City residents, the system supplies people in Orange, Putnam, Ulster and Westchester Counties.
New York City is already building a plant in the Bronx to filter water from its Croton system in Westchester and Putnam Counties, which supplies 10 percent of the water. The plant will cost $600 million to build and $45 million a year to operate. The city was forced to build that plant because the Croton system's water was being degraded by street runoff, sewage and other pollutants. City environmental officials pointed to the Croton watershed in citing the need to protect the Catskill system.
The city's Environmental Protection Commissioner, Albert F. Appleton, has been pressing State Health Commissioner David Axelrod to back away from a draft proposal made in late 1989 that would have required filtration by the year 2005. Yesterday, Mr. Appleton said the lobbying had paid off. "We have demonstrated that the city is serious about watershed control," he said.
 Peter Slocum, a spokesman for Mr. Axelrod, said the State Health Department would "go with a regulation which would not necessarily require filtration as long as the city demonstrated a willingness and ability to adequately protect its watershed." The Health Commissioner made his decision based on a belief in Mr. Appleton's "good faith" and the great expense of filtration, Mr. Slocum said.
 
Trust Fund May Be Needed
 Mr. Slocum said the state would probably require New York City to create and finance a trust dedicated to watershed protection to insure it "fulfills its commitment."
The State Health Department is responsible for carrying out Federal water-quality laws, which were tightened in recent years to require filtration unless strict watershed controls were imposed.
In two weeks, Mr. Appleton said, the Health Department will publish rules allowing New York City to avoid filtration as long as its watershed protection effort goes forward. The decision could be reconsidered at any time.
The city's Department of Environmental Protection is now revising watershed rules. A draft released in September has been poorly received by some Catskill residents, who fear that the new rules would inhibit economic development and badly hurt agriculture.
In particular, residents are concerned about plans to establish wide buffer zones in the watershed to reduce runoff of pollutants. Such zones would be required between streams and certain activities, including farming.

HEADLINE: Many Hispanic Americans Reported In Ill Health and Lacking Insurance

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

 BODY:
Hispanic Americans lack health insurance more often than any other ethnic group in the United States, according to several reports in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
They also suffer disproportionately higher incidences of diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, certain cancers and other serious ailments, the reports said. 
 Hispanic Americans are up to three times as likely as non-Hispanic whites to develop diabetes, a disease of unknown cause. The severity of the disease is also greater for Hispanic Americans, with complications like blindness appearing more frequently.
Fewer Hispanic Americans are immunized against measles and other infections, a problem the reports attributes in part to poverty and lower levels of education. Rates of preventable diseases like lead poisoning are higher and violence and narcotic addiction also take a disproportionately high toll among Hispanic men.
Hispanic Americans succumb mostly to the nation's leading killers: heart disease, cancer and stroke. Deaths resulting from cancer of the stomach are twice as high for Hispanic Americans as for non-Hispanic whites. Hispanic Americans also suffer from an excess incidence of cancers of the esophagus, breast, pancreas and cervix.
 
Surgeon General Lead Author
 These and other findings of a disproportionately bad health-care situation for Hispanic Americans appear in an issue of The Journal devoted to the health care of Hispanic Americans. The team was headed by the nation's top-ranking doctors of Hispanic origin, Antonia C. Novello, the Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service.
The figures, one of the largest compilations yet published on the subject, were obtained from studies in the medical literature and Government reports and surveys. Some data are incomplete, as the reports note. For example, the American Medical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs points out that the United States did not list Hispanic death rates separately until 1988, when the standard death certificate form was changed.
By the year 2000, the reports say, Hispanic Americans are expected to number more than 31 million people, which they say would make it the largest minority group in the United States.
Hispanic Americans are also being unusually hard hit by AIDS. Although Hispanic Americans make up 7.9 percent of the population, they account for 14 percent of reported AIDS cases, with nearly 21 percent of the AIDS cases among women and 22 percent of the AIDS cases among children.
In Puerto Rico, heterosexual transmission of the disease accounts for a higher percentage of the total number of cases than in any other area in the United States.
 
Few Are in Health Professions
 Hispanic Americans are seriously under represented in the health occupations, particularly those requiring higher levels of skill. Fewer than 5 percent of doctors are of Hispanic origin.
In an editorial in the journal, Surgeon General Novello called attention to the diverse populations of Hispanic Americans and the dangers of "uncritical ethnic labeling" of all populations with ancestral ties to Spain, Latin America and the Spanish speaking Caribbean.
Many Hispanics have lived in the United States for centuries and others are new arrivals, and dialects, idioms and vocabulary also vary among subgroups. Not all Hispanic groups suffer equally, the report indicates, with Cuban Americans more likely than the others to have private health insurance, for example.
Inappropriate labels can obscure areas of great need, said Dr. Novello, who eared college and medical degrees in her native Puerto Rico. "Poorly defined groupings can also result in programs that do not respond to actual needs and cultural sensitivities," said a team of authors headed by Dr. Novello.
Dr. Eli Ginzberg, a health economist at Columbia University, wrote in The Journal that the Government began collecting health data based on ethnic background too late to provide adequate measures of the health status of Hispanics, by subgroup and by gender.
Although data are incomplete, the reports said it was clear that more than 70 percent of Hispanics Americans lived in six of the most populous states, California, Texas, New York, Florida, New Jersey and Illinois. Hispanic populations are heavily concentrated in metropolitan centers, particularly the inner cities.
Health-care disparities in states that border Mexico are especially acute, the report said. Dr. David C. Warner of the University of Texas said, "It is unlikely that any other border in the world separates two nations having such variety in health status, entitlements and utiliztion."
Many of those in the Hispanic population along the border live in communities that lack septic tanks, sewers or running water. Outdoor privies commonly abut water wells, making most of the water unfit for consumption. Residents also suffer from water and air pollution and illegal dumping of hazardous wastes.
 
Improvements Are Sought
 El Paso is the only large city along the United States side of the border that has a comprehensive public hospital.
Dr. Warner said Mexico and the United States needed to develop new ways to improve the environment, sanitation and many other health problems and to provide access to basic health care.
Well over one-half of Cuban Americans have private health insurance, the largest percentage among Hispanic Americans, said a team of researchers from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, the University of California at Los Angeles and the Federal Department of Health and Human Services.
Dr. Fernando M. Trevino of the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, who headed the team, said that more than one-third of Mexican Americans and one-fifth of Puerto Ricans lacked health insurance, as against one-fifth of non-Hispanics blacks and one-tenth of non-Hispanics whites.
 
Failures to Use Care Cited
 Hispanic patients who speak English are more likely to have a regular source of medical care than those who speak only Spanish. But Hispanic Americans who need medical services are often reluctant to use them because of barriers related to culture and language. Also, uninsured Hispanic Americans are less likely to benefit from treatment because their ailments are diagnosed at a more advanced stage.
Dr. Antonio Furino of the University of Texas at San Antonio and Dr. Eric Munoz of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark said that although many Hispanic Americans were military veterans and eligible for care from the Veterans Administration, they often failed to use the benefits.
Other authors reported that Hispanic Americans are three times as likely as other groups to receive no prenatal care, thus contributing to deaths and sickness among newborns.

HEADLINE: Consumer Debt Grows Only Slightly

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Consumer debt grew by a slim $1.72 billion in November, the Government said today, in another reflection of consumer caution in a weakening economy.
Bill Wood, an economist at Cahners Economics, a forecasting firm in Newton, Mass., said of the seasonally adjusted figure, "It's in line with most of the other indicators of consumer behavior, that they are pulling back a bit." 
 "These are very, very small increases," said Sandra Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a Washington consulting firm.
 
Slightly Up From October
 The Federal Reserve said consumer credit grew at a 2.8 percent annual rate, up from a revised 2.2 percent rate in October. The October level was originally reported to have been 2.4 percent.
"The 2.8 percent is less than inflation," which rose at a 3.7 percent annual rate in November, Ms. Shaber said. "The rate of growth in both 1988 and 1989 was nearly 9 percent."
Ms. Shaber attributed the slower pace to consumer caution in the face of a deteriorating economy and the threat of war in the Persian Gulf, as well as to tighter lending restrictions by financial institutions.
Consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
 
Fewer Car Loans
 Automobile loans fell for the eighth straight month, down $413 million, or an annual rate of 1.7 percent, after a 3.6 percent drop in October. Car loans have declined every month this year, except for January and March.
While fleet sales propped up the market in early November, sales of the Big Three auto makers -- the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation -- dropped 24 percent in the final 10 days, compared with the corresponding period of 1989. For all of last year, sales of the Big Three were off 6.8 percent.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Across the South, a Clash of Doubt and Fervor

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BILOXI, Miss., Jan. 8

 BODY:
The electronic sign in front of the Royal d'Iberville Hotel here carries a message that can be found on billboards all over the South.
"Support . . . Support . . . Support Desert Shield!" it flashes out again and again over the broad sandy beach leading down to the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. 
 And to hear the people here and elsewhere in the South, traditionally a fortress of patriotism, there is support for President Bush's demand that Iraq's troops leave Kuwait, by force if necessary.
 
No Rush to War
 But that support often seems to be qualified, hemmed in by doubts and qualms and conditions. It may not be the kind of support likely to see President Bush through a long, difficult war.
"I'm the wife of an Air Force sergeant, and I'll be a good soldier and follow my President on Desert Shield," said Rita Garnier, an office manager at the Royal d'Iberville. "But I say frankly and right up front that I'm against us being over there, that I doubt there's any real reason for us to be involved, and that I have more doubts the longer it all drags on."
In conversations with some 75 people during a weeklong, 1,500-mile journey by car from the shores of the Atlantic near Norfolk, Va., to the shore of the Gulf of Mexico here, the word that came up most often was "doubt."
Other words and phrases were common: "confusion" and "another Vietnam" and "Talk, not fight" and, not least of all, "Go get 'em." But "doubt" was the word most frequently uttered.
 
'I Still Don't Know'
 It was the very first word used in the first of the 75 conversations, a word spoken by Nellie Cutchins of Virginia Beach when she was asked to sum up her thoughts on the American-led operation in the Persian Gulf.
"I want to be a good citizen and support our country," she continued, taking a break from her work as a cleaning woman. "But I keep waiting for somebody to explain to me why we are over there and whether it's worth it. I still don't know, and it's been going on for months. I'm afraid we might be headed for another Vietnam."
The ambivalence that surfaced in informal conversations with Southerners was reflected in the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, taken Saturday through Monday. It showed that Southerners, like Americans nationwide, were evenly divided on force versus sanctions in the gulf.
Among the respondents, 47 percent of Southerners favored military action if Iraq does not withdraw its troops from Kuwait by the Jan. 15 deadline set by the United Nations, while 47 percent of Southerners preferred to give economic sanctions more time to work. Among Americans nationwide, 46 percent favored military action and 47 percent favored continued sanctions.
The doubt about United States involvement in the gulf was most striking when expressed by military dependents or by members of families with strong ties to the military. Traditionally known for its staunch patriotism, the South is home to an unusually large number of military bases and, further, sends an unusually large percentage of its young people into the armed services.
There are military bases all around Biloxi, just as there are bases around dozens of other Southern towns and cities, all the way back up to Montgomery, Ala., and on to Atlanta and Florence, S.C., and Fayetteville, N.C., and into Virginia Beach and Norfolk. And while each place has its "Support Desert Shield" billboards, each also has its doubters.
 
Will 'Muddy' Politics Kill Her Husband?
 In Fayetteville, home of the elite 82d Airborne Division, one of the first units to head for the Middle East, Belvia Williams worries that her husband, Staff Sgt. Andrew J. Williams 3d, might die fighting for oil and what she calls "muddy" politics rather than to reverse an invasion and violations of human rights.
"The President just hasn't told us enough about why we're there, and that's why I have so many doubts," she said. "And I'm not sure we have negotiated enough. I support our troops, and I certainly support my husband. And I keep to myself in my letters and our few phone calls what I really feel."
In Norfolk, where streets and stores are noticeably quieter because so many ships and troops have sailed for the Middle East, reservations about the possibility of war have divided the Ogdon family.
 
A Father's Pride, A Yellow Ribbon
 A few weeks ago, Glenn Ogdon, a 23-year-old Marine reservist whose military speciality is operating landing craft, was called up.
His father, Donald, a retired psychology professor, was proud to see Glenn go. He recalls wishing him him well and saying, "War is a terrible thing, but we've got to stop Hussein."
Then the professor went out and tied a yellow ribbon around a tree in the front yard.
Glenn's 20-year-old brother, Don, a rock musician, went out and slapped a new bumper sticker on his car. It reads: "War Is Costly. Peace Is Priceless."
"It's a war over oil -- oil that we wouldn't need if we'd just spend war money on energy research," Don argued.
"It's a war to stop a madman," his father countered.
The two agree on one thing: If war comes and does not end quickly, there will be demonstrators in the streets.
"And I'll be one of them," Don said.
In Montgomery, Morris Dees, a leading civil rights lawyer, put it another way: "I believe we have to do something about Hussein, and I hope talk will do the job. But if it comes to war, George Bush better hope it goes the way Rambo would do it."
Thus far, only Atlanta, a city with many residents born outside the South, has seen big peace demonstrations. They have been organized in good part by the Rev. McKinley Young, pastor of Big Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the city's major black churches.
Mr. Young contends that United States troops have been sent to defend "the richest refugees in the world -- Kuwaiti oil sheiks" and that President Bush showed "extreme insensitivity" by setting a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to get out of Kuwait.
"What he's done," Mr. Young said," is make Martin Luther King's birthday the equivalent of D-Day for a war in which blacks will suffer the most. Blacks have been forced by lack of other opportunities to volunteer for our army in disproportionate numbers, and so they'll die in disproportionate numbers. If any military person seeks refuge in our church, we will try to help him or her."
Most Southern blacks seem not to attach any racial or "third world" connotation to United States involvement in the Middle East. However, from a broader standpoint, many seem concerned about the disproportionately high number of blacks in the armed services and what that means, in a war there or anywhere else. Nationally, 29 percent of blacks said they favored military action in the gulf instead of giving sanctions more time to work, according to the Times/ CBS News Poll. Forty-eight percent of whites favored military action.
On Sunday, Mr. Young declared in his sermon, "Oil and land are never more important than people." Then he and several hundred parishioners wrote antiwar letters and cards and mailed them to members of Congress.
That night, at the First Presbyterian Church, a mostly white congregation in Atlanta, there was a candlelight vigil for peace in the Middle East. One of the thousand or so participants was Marjorie Chandley, an economic development consultant for the state of Georgia.
"What I'm hoping for," she said, expressing a frequently heard point of view, "is that the President will give negotiations and sanctions more opportunity to work. It was O.K. for us to take action to protect Saudi Arabia, and Hussein must leave Kuwait. But this country won't back this President in a war unless it is convinced that talks and sanctions have been given enough time to work. I have my doubts that is the case to this point."
Like Ms. Chandley, James O. Buchanan of Raleigh, N.C., believes that American troops should have been sent to the Middle East and that Hussein must leave Kuwait. But Mr. Buchanan, a B-17 bomber crew chief in World War II, is one of those Southerners who also believes there has been enough negotiating, and that economic sanctions have been given ample time to work.
"The point has come where we've got to move or we're going to get bogged down," he said. "The peace people are beginning to get involved. There's a danger of another Vietnam. Let's do it -- quick and dirty. I learned about war the hard way."
 
Not Everyone Says, 'Enough Is Enough'
 In Montgomery, Mr. Buchanan's viewpoint was echoed by Mack Traywick, a construction superintendent.
"Hussein has been given every possible chance to get out," he said. "Enough is enough. Nobody likes war. But we're free in this country today because those who went before us weren't afraid to take a stand. I trust the man who runs this country. Let's get it over with."
But to many Southerners, among them Clay Herget of Raleigh, a Denison University freshman home for the holidays, Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Traywick mistakenly see the Middle East situation in too clear-cut a way.
"In fact," said Mr. Herget, "its a gray situation with all kinds of confusing factors, from an illegal invasion of Kuwait to whether we have talked enough or too much."
Still, Mr. Herget has no plans to become a peace protester. "For one thing, I roomed with a Saudi prince for a while. For another, this isn't Vietnam. None of my friends are going to volunteer to go. But on the other hand, if the draft starts, they're not going to run into the streets or cut off their toes."
Mr. Herget's father, Barlow, a Raleigh City Councilman, and his mother, Millie, a gift shop owner, say the threat of war is beginning to affect the South's economy. Clay's sister, Casey, a senior at the University of Virginia, says many of her friends already have lost their part-time jobs.
"People are afraid to make major economic decisions on things like construction and major purchases because they don't know what's going to happen," Councilman Herget said.
Mrs. Herget said that some of her stationery customers have said they will return party invitations if war breaks out. "They don't feel it would be right to have a good time when people are dying," she said.
In Florence, S.C., William Harper, owner of Sav-a-Ton Antiques, a glassware business, said sales were off by half because of war worry. "We're being held hostage, economically," he said. "There's a lot of politics in all of this Iraq stuff, along with the craziness of Hussein. But that's life. We have to do what we have to do. Southerners don't see a lot of sense in intellectualizing something like this a whole lot. Just do it."
James T. Owens, a retired railroad engineer from the Atlanta suburb of Chamblee, says he also sees no reason to intellectualize about the gulf crisis. But he's not adverse to applying a little psychoanalysis. "I'm afraid we've got some mighty big egos at work on both sides in this," he said. "How do you keep from loosing face? Does that drive you to war?"
He pondered for a moment, then shook his head slowly. "I hope not," he said. "But I have my doubts."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
A Company Is Finding The Good in Pollution

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: THOMASTON, Me., Jan. 2

 BODY:
A radically different approach to air pollution -- converting harmful combustion waste products into something useful -- is being tested here at New England's only cement plant. A geochemist has found a way to combine the acid and ash emissions from the plant to produce fertilizer, distilled water and limestone for the cement plant, and hardly anything else.
The system's designers think the process will have wide application in other industries trying to cope with pollutants, including paper mills, trash-to-energy plants and some coal plants. In addition to producing a product that can be sold, the proceedure eliminates the problem of disposing of chemicals filtered out of the smokestack and the need to buy neutralizing materials for a "scrubber." It also allows the use of cheap but dirty high-sulfur fuel, even while reducing air pollution. 
 Factories that want to cut pollution have long had the option of installing scrubbers, which capture sulfur dioxide that causes acid rain by spraying the smoke with a limestone solution, chemically locking up the sulfur. But that is expensive, and merely transforms acid that would have gone into the air into a solid that can poison groundwater and must be disposed of.
 
Half the Problem
 And sulfur dioxide is only half the problem for many fuel-burning factories. They also produce ash, which is highly alkaline and can include heavy metals that can easily dissolve in underground water.
In contrast, the "recovery scrubber" here -- a small chemical reactor -- combines the sulfur dioxide and ash to make fertilizer. The process begins with capturing in filters the waste dust leaving the concrete kiln and dissolving it in water. The dust includes ash, limestone that has been contaminated with sulfur, and potassium, which in cement-making is a contaminant. The water is pumped into a tank, and the exhaust gases that passed through the filter, which contain sulfur dioxide, are allowed to bubble through the water.
In the tank, the calcium-sulfur compounds are broken apart, and the sulfur and potassium combine to produce potassium sulfate, a fertilizer. Waste heat from the smoke is then used to distill away the water and recover the fertilizer. The distilled water is used in the kiln. At the same time, the calcium combines with carbon dioxide, and is turned back into limestone.
The inventor, Dr. Garrett Morrison, a geochemist, first tried the chemical reaction in a trash barrel. Then he persuaded the Passamaquoddy Indian tribe, which then owned the cement company, to put up $250,000 for a larger experiment.
The tribe, which had bought the plant in 1983 with the proceeds of a land settlement, has since sold it, but owns the rights to the process and hopes it will be commercialized and applied to a variety of industries.
Proponents of the system say sales of the fertilizer and savings on waste disposal will more than pay for the recovery scrubber. In addition, under the Clean Air Act, a factory that cuts acid emissions can sell the "right" to emit the same amount of pollution. This raises the possibility that some companies will install this kind of scrubber even if they already meet clean air rules, just to increase their profits.
Furthermore, many plants must buy an alkali to neutralize the sulfur dioxide, and also pay to haul away the resulting solids as well as ash, said Thomas N. Tureen, chairman of Tribal Assets Management, the Passamaquoddy's Portland-based company. The recovery scrubber can use that ash in place of the alkali.
 
Prototype Is Tested <--HE>
 An $11 million full-scale prototype began tests late last month, with the cost split evenly between the Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology program and CDN-USA, a Spanish consortium that now owns the cement company, called the Dragon Products Company.
The recovery scrubber has special value for cement plants because it also rescues for re-use the 20 percent of the raw material, limestone, that ordinarily escapes from the kiln up the stack or into the filters.
Dr. Joseph P. Strakey, the associate director for clean coal technology at the Energy Department's Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center, called the scrubber "extremely promising."
"Usually, you don't scrub at a profit," he said, adding that in power plants, scrubbers can drive up the cost of electricity by 10 to 15 percent. Mr. Tureen pointed out that all other scrubbing technologies release carbon dioxide, a gas believed to cause global warming, as the limestone reacts with the sulfur. But this technology consumes carbon dioxide.
Dr. Strakey and others think the scrubber can probably be adapted to a wide variety of industries, but say it seems especially valuable for cement. At a cement plant, a mixture of limestone and a few other ingredients is roasted with a blast of flame, generally from oil or coal.
Most of the mixture goes on to be cement, but the kiln also produces prodigious amounts of "kiln dust," a pollutant. Collected in filters, millions of tons of this kiln dust can pile up in scarce landfill space, and threaten groundwater. The waste also shortens the useful life of limestone quarries, which usually determines the life of the cement plant.
 
Extending Limestone Supply
 Dragon has about 85 years of limestone left at 80 percent efficiency; recovering the 20 percent will make it last even longer. But Dragon also has a 50-foot mountain in back, a waste pile known as Dragon Mountain, that used to be an 80-foot-deep quarry. It is full, and establishing a new dump could cost $2 million.
Now the mountain can be slowly recycled by the recovery scrubber.
Meanwhile, the scrubber is producing potassium sulfate, a fertilizer. (When backyard gardeners buy 6-10-4 at the lawn and garden center, the "4" is potassium.)
But one problem is that the reaction works only at a cool temperature, so the exhaust gases must be sprayed with water first. And the potassium sulfate concentration in water is only about 2 percent. Most industries would dump potassium sulfate in such low concentrations, Dr. Morrison said, but he added, "That is not only environmentally unsound, but economically unsound."
 
Solution in a Pump
 The scrubber uses waste heat from the stack to distill the water. But the stack gas is only about 245 degrees Fahrenheit, and once it is run through two heat exchangers, to prevent contamination, it is only 100 degrees, far below the boiling point. The solution is a vacuum pump, which lowers the air pressure so that the water boils at 100 degrees.
Apart from reversing the buildup of waste and making a marketable byproduct, the scrubber assures that the remaining exhaust has been stripped of 97 percent of its sulfur. The former system took out only 58 percent. Dragon was already using high-sulfur coal, but a plant that had been on expensive coal or oil that is 1.5 percent sulfur and that had installed such a scrubber could switch to cheaper fuel that is 3 percent sulfur and still cut emissions by 90 percent.
In a paper mill or waste-to-energy incinerator, where there is no kiln dust, the sulfur dioxide would be put in a reaction tank with the alkaline ash to produce the potassium sulfate.
Another advantage: Trash incinerators produce ash with high concentrations of heavy metals, but the reaction in the recovery scrubber makes them insoluble in water, so disposal is safer.
Ordinary coal-burning plants do not produce enough ash to sustain the reaction, but those in Eastern Europe, which use poor quality coal with high ash content, would be suitable, the designers say.
Mr. Tureen, the chairman of Tribal Assets, describes the scrubber as "a mixture of Indian environmentalism and Yankee frugality."

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
BUSH ASKS CONGRESS TO BACK USE OF FORCE IF IRAQ DEFIES DEADLINE ON KUWAIT PULLOUT

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
President Bush called on Congress today to adopt a resolution supporting the use of force against Iraq if it did not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15. He said such a vote would send a message to President Saddam Hussein that the United States was united in its determination to make him withdraw from Kuwait.
Because Mr. Bush is unlikely to return to Congress again before sending American troops into combat, the endorsement he requested today, if adopted, would be as close as Congress would come to a formal declaration of war in advance of an attack on Iraq. 
 He invited Congress to join him in sending "the clearest possible message to Saddam Hussein that he must withdraw without condition or delay from Kuwait." But he offered a political warning that "anything less would only encourage Iraqi intransigence."
 
An End to Weeks of Indecision
 The President's letter to Congressional leaders, ending weeks of White House indecision over whether to seek support from Congress before sending American forces into combat, sets the stage for a major debate in the House and Senate, beginning on Thursday and due to last through Saturday.
In his letter, Mr. Bush also said a resolution "would help dispel any belief that may exist in the minds of Iraq's leaders that the United States lacks the necessary unity to act decisively in response to Iraq's continued aggression against Kuwait." [Text, page A6.]
The President made his request as Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq arrived in Geneva today for a meeting on Wednesday that is considered perhaps the last chance for a peaceful resolution of the gulf crisis before the Jan. 15 withdrawal deadline imposed by the United Nations. Mr. Aziz said he was prepared to conduct "constructive talks," but would not yield to American pressure. [Page A6.]
 
'All Necessary Means'
 Mr. Bush's letter was the first Presidential request for Congressional backing for offensive military action since President Johnson asked for the Gulf of Tonkin resolution on the Vietnam War on Aug. 5, 1964.
Mr. Bush specifically asked both houses to adopt a resolution that "supports the use of all necessary means" to carry out the United Nations Security Council resolution of Nov. 29, which set the deadline. That resolution, like Mr. Bush's letter, used the phrase "all necessary means" as a euphemism for military force. Mr. Bush made the request only after Congressional leaders said in recent days that he was almost certain to receive Congressional endorsement, though not without a heated debate and divided vote that the President several times told them he would prefer to avoid.
The letter arrived on Capitol Hill as several closed meetings were being held by both parties in both houses, seeking to agree on language to propose when Congressional debate begins later this week, probably on Thursday in both houses, after Mr. Baker meets Mr. Aziz. Democratic and Republican leaders said the direct Presidential request would be likely to win over some wavering lawmakers.
Mr. Bush's request came as a New York Times/CBS News Poll, completed on Monday, showed that the public remained evenly split between going to war or sticking to sanctions after the 15th. Unlike some other polls, which asked only whether the country should go to war, the Times/CBS News Poll offered continued reliance on sanctions as an alternative.
The telephone survey of 1,348 adults, begun on Saturday, found that 46 percent said that if Iraq did not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15, then "the United States should start military actions against Iraq." But 47 percent said the United States should "wait longer to see if the trade embargo and other economic sanctions work."
The difference was far less than the poll's margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points, and not significantly changed from a reading in December, when 45 percent favored combat and 48 percent preferred waiting even after Jan. 15.
The Times/CBS News Poll also found a sharply increased expectation of war from the public, with 57 percent saying they anticipated that there would be fighting with Iraq, compared with 44 percent last month. Sixty percent said they thought Congress should have to vote a declaration of war -- a specific statement not on anyone's current legislative agenda -- before American troops went into combat, while 32 percent disagreed.
And although 51 percent expected the Baker-Aziz meeting to "involve serious discussion," compared with 36 percent who said it was "mostly for show," 68 percent wanted a meeting with President Hussein himself before Jan. 15, a meeting Mr. Bush has all but ruled out.
Even before Mr. Bush's letter arrived at the offices of the leaders of both parties in both houses, the Hill buzzed with meetings and rumors of meetings to draft language for resolutions, or at least to narrow and organize the options.
House Democrats met in the office of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, to plan language for two proposals, one asserting Congress' sole power to decide when to go to war, and other contending that while force could not be ruled out ultimately, the time had not yet come to use it and sanctions should be tried for a longer time.
 
Mitchell and Nunn Meet
 The second proposal was said to be patterned on one being discussed in the office of the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, involving him and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Republicans were meeting among themselves and also seeking Democratic support for a resolution doing what the President asked.
And Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, issued a statement complaining that "it's long past time for Congress to get in the game."
Mr. Bush's letter said it would have been helpful for Mr. Baker to have had a Congressional resolution at hand for his meeting in Geneva and maintained that the President had "frequently stated my desire for such a resolution." But Mr. Mitchell said that when Mr. Bush had made such a request orally, he had always conditioned it by saying he wanted a resolution if it could be adopted overwhelmingly and without much debate, something Congressional leaders replied was not possible. Mr. Dole, citing the Bush letter, said, "If Tariq Aziz asks Jim Baker, 'What have you brought from Congress?,' he'll have to say, 'Nothing.' "
But Mr. Baker will be able to take the predictions of such leaders as House Speaker Thomas S. Foley that a resolution supporting Mr. Bush would pass by this weekend.
If adopted, the resolution would be cited by Administration officals as closing off any remaining argument over whether Congress had used its war-making authority to give the President an authorization the White House had often said was not needed.
The Constitutional power of Congress to declare war has been invoked directly and specifically only five times: in the War of 1812, the Mexican War, the Spanish-American War and both World Wars. But the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, sought by Mr. Johnson and approved by votes of 88 to 2 in the Senate and 416 to 0 in the House after reports of an attack on United States vessels, supported Mr. Johnson in his bid "to prevent further aggression" and thus was seen by supporters of the Vietnam War as the equivalent of a formal declaration. Many in Congress later felt they had been deceived into hastily approving military action against North Vietnam, which had in fact been planned months before the incident.
While Mr. Nunn, who could not be reached for comment, was understood to be preparing to advocate delay in using force, his House counterpart, Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, said the right vote was a vote to authorize Mr. Bush to use force.
Mr. Aspin's view was shared in a Senate hearing by Alexander M. Haig Jr., President Reagan's first Secretary of State, who said there was little alternative to war and further reliance on sanctions would be "a profound strategic blunder." He also predicted that once Iraq saw that United States force would be used unstintingly, "I think there's a very good chance one of Saddam's colonels will take him out."
At the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, attended only by Democrats, another view came from Cyrus R. Vance, who was President Carter's first Secretary of State. Mr. Vance said that if the United States went to war, it would soon find itself "virtually alone in a bitter and bloody war that will not be won quickly or without heavy casualties."

Ford's Pockets Are No Longer Full

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Just a couple of annual reports ago, the Ford Motor Company was selling cars and trucks so briskly and profitably that union officials moaned about the crush of overtime and some investors fretted that the nation's No. 2 auto maker was not investing its multibillion-dollar hoard of cash quickly enough.
Ford executives have not heard such complaints lately. Now, like the rest of the domestic car industry, Ford is idling assembly lines and laying off workers in response to slow sales. Its financial strength, once the envy of corporate America, has declined to the point that Ford directors, who are to meet at company headquarters in Dearborn, Mich., on Thursday, are facing a tough decision on whether to conserve cash by cutting the dividend on common stock. 
 Financial analysts are predicting that the annual $3-a-share dividend will be cut. The stock price has fallen as investors have sold in anticipation of a dividend cut and a fourth-quarter loss. Ford executives have vowed not to cut the dividend.
The dimming of Ford's star stems partly from perception and partly from substance. As might be expected, Ford's performance is falling short of the hyperbolic descriptions used by analysts a few years ago. Ford was sometimes portrayed as America's answer to Japanese auto makers, largely on the popularity of its midsized Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars, its growing market share and its record profit.
"The box score is that Ford gets an A-plus for factory operations," said James Womack, research director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's automotive study team. "It deals with suppliers better than some other auto makers, and it's trying hard to build a truly global organization. But its products are struggling."
Under Harold A. Poling, who took over as chief executive last year after Donald E. Petersen retired, Ford has retained the depth and experience it feels it needs to weather the tough business conditions. Mr. Poling was orginally scheduled to retire before Mr. Petersen, but senior Ford officials say the board's concern about an impending industry downturn led to Mr. Poling's promotion to chief executive.
Even as Mr. Poling was taking office, it was clear the tide was turning against Ford. Last year Chevrolet grabbed back the lead in overall car sales. The Taurus and Sable are becoming dated, but will not get even a face lift until later this year, nor a complete redesign until 1994. By contrast, the Honda Accord, which in 1989 replaced the Taurus as the best-selling car model in the United States, was redesigned after only four years.
Mr. Womack and others worry that Ford has not managed to introduce new and attractive vehicles quickly enough to keep up with an onslaught from Japanese auto makers and a revived General Motors Corporation, which plans significant changes for several models this year. Sales of some newly redesigned Ford mainstays like the Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar have also been weak.
The recession and continued strong competition from Honda and Toyota have hurt Ford's domestic rivals as well. The Big Three companies reported Friday that sales of cars and light trucks fell again in 1990, by 5.1 percent, to 13.8 million vehicles.
But Ford has begun to show more vulnerability to American and European competition, slowing the momentum it gained with the spectacular success of the Taurus and Sable, which were introduced in late 1985. The popularity of their rounded styling helped Ford pass G.M.'s Chevrolet division in sales; Ford even made bigger profits in the late 1980's than G.M., which is much larger, for the first time in decades.
Since then, however, several efforts at home and abroad have faltered. In Europe, the recent introduction of the redesigned Escort, which differs from the American model of the same name, was poorly received by reviewers. Ford's European operations, which once made a strong contribution to earnings, have suffered in both market share and profit.
 
Conservative Shift Is Seen
 Ronald L. Glantz, automotive analyst for Dean Witter in San Francisco, said Ford became more conservative after breaking the Detroit mold with the Taurus, because it began to make its other cars look like that model instead of recognizing that the Taurus's success stemmed largely from its distinctive styling.
One notable success has been the Explorer four-door utility vehicle, which drew rave reviews from automotive enthusiast magazines. The Explorer has been selling strongly, without any financial incentives or discount programs, since its introduction last year.
Joel Pitcoff, Ford's manager of research and analysis, noted that the Taurus's share of the four-door midsize market "has held up quite well, in spite of the fact that the sales of all of those cars has been falling."
He also defended the time between model redesigns, saying: "I can remember when there was identifiable change every year for every model. With the proliferation of different models and competitors, that's impossible for a full-line producer like Ford. Besides, our consumer research says there's no need for it."
Soaring engineering and tooling costs for new models, coupled with the expense of meeting safety and environmental regulations, will push Ford's estimated capital expenditures to $32 billion in the next five years, compared with $23 billion in the previous five years.
 
Big Expenses at Jaguar
 One of the biggest-ticket items in Ford's capital budget is its $2.5 billion acquisition of Jaguar P.L.C. of Britain, which may require as much as $2.5 billion more in tooling and engineering costs. Although Jaguar's cars are struggling to compete with the latest luxury vehicles from Japan and Germany, Ford made the deal to take advantage of the company's name recognition and heritage.
Many analysts have criticized the acquisition as too expensive, but Ford maintains that it is satisfied, although it says the payoff from Jaguar will not be evident for 5 to 10 years, when new models are introduced.
Ford has also spent aggressively to diversify into financial services and has become one of the largest operators of savings and loans, a strategy that has cost it hundreds of millions of dollars to cover bad loans rather than generate additional capital.
Consequently, Ford has been forced to borrow much more to pay for capital investment and rebates, which average about $1,200 a vehicle, raising doubts among financial analysts of whether it is prudent to keep paying the full $3 stock dividend.
 
Stock Has Languished
 Since becoming a public company in 1956, Ford has reduced its dividend three times, most recently in the 1982 recession. Executives have since asserted that they want to prove the company could be profitable and sustain a dividend during a recession.
In the last year Ford's stock has traded as high as $49 a share, but is now languishing near $25. [The stock closed unchanged Tuesday at $25.50 a share.] Analysts say the price reflects investors' belief that a cut in the dividend cannot be avoided. Currently, however, if the board does not cut the dividend, the $3 payout represents a yield of nearly 12 percent.
Members of the Ford family are particularly interested in the board's dividend policy since they receive about $106 million in dividends each year on their restricted stock. Other public shareholders receive $1.27 billion at the current rate.
Mr. Glantz of Dean Witter said all of the Big Three domestic auto makers were squeezed financially and would cut their dividends, but "right now they are playing chicken -- no one wants to go first."

HEADLINE: U.S. DEPLORES PLAN BY SOVIETS TO SEND TROOPS TO BALTICS

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The United States today condemned as "provocative" Moscow's plan to send troops to seven restive Soviet regions and suggested that such action could endanger Soviet-American relations if it led to violence or signaled a crackdown on political activity.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the plan to send paratroops to enforce military conscription in the three Baltic republics and four other areas "amounts to intimidation." The Soviet announcement was made on Monday, but no deployments of the paratroops have been confirmed. 
 Adding to the tension and uncertainty in the Baltic region, the Prime Minister of the independence-minded republic of Lithuania and her Cabinet resigned today in a dispute with the republic's Parliament over economic and political policy. [Page A3.]
 
'Reversal' of Progress
 Mr. Fitzwater said the Soviet announcement marked a "reversal" of the progress that Washington had seen last year in talks between the Kremlin and the Soviet republics as secessionist movements wrestled with Moscow over the future shape of their nation.
The Bush Administration's rebuke, which also was read to reporters during a briefing at the State Department, reflected concern over what Washington sees as an increasing alliance between President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and conservative forces in the military and elsewhere in the Soviet Government.
Administration officials also said that although a resurgence of conservative forces was affecting internal Soviet politics, they did not believe that it was causing serious harm to relations between the superpowers.
 
Agricultural Credits Approved
 Even as the Administration leveled its criticism, the Agriculture Department announced today that Moscow had been allocated $900 million in short-term credit guarantees to buy American agricultural products this year. The credit is part of $1 billion in guarantees pledged by President Bush on Dec. 13 to help the Soviet Union through "tough times, difficult times" in its food supply.
Though Administration officials deny serious harm to relations, they have said that they believe a resur- gence of military influence is behind recent problems in arms control, including what the United States says are Soviet efforts to evade counting and verification rules in the recently signed treaty reducing conventional weapons in Europe.
There also have been differences over such issues as verification that have slowed the final work on another treaty that would sharply reduce long-range nuclear weapons for the first time. That treaty is supposed to be signed by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev at a summit meeting in February in Moscow.
But officials have said in recent days that the United States is strongly considering delaying the meeting, in part because of the problems in arms control but even more because of the uncertainty in the Persian Gulf and the possibility of war there, and the increasing political turmoil within the Soviet Union.
 
U.S. Monitoring Moves
 In the clearest signal yet of Washington's concern about Soviet political troubles, Mr. Fitzwater said today that the United States was "monitoring closely" the planned deployment of Soviet forces to enforce military conscription in Moldavia, the Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and the three Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.
"The pace of improvement in Soviet relations continues, I think, in terms of the big picture, if you will," Mr. Fitzwater said. "We still have continuing improvements on any number of fronts. But on the other hand, we feel this is important enough to point out that it is a potential problem."
The fact that the United States issued its statement even before any Soviet troops were reported to have arrived in the seven republics indicated the extent of the Administration's concern about the turn of events, officials said.
In his statement, Mr. Fitzwater said: "This action represents a serious step toward an escalation of tension within the U.S.S.R. and makes the peaceful evolution of relations among the peoples of the Soviet Union more difficult."
 
Action Called 'Intimidation'
 He said the United States was "especially concerned" that the dispatch of troops to the Baltic republics would set back discussions about the status of those regions, which are seeking independence from Moscow.
"The United States urges the U.S.S.R. to cease attempts at intimidation and turn back to negotiations that are conducted free of pressure and the use of force," Mr. Fitzwater said.
Richard A. Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said the American Ambassador in Moscow, Jack Matlock, had raised the deployment with Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze on Monday and asked for an explanation. Mr. Matlock received a return call from the Foreign Ministry today that "basically just confirmed what the Ministry of Defense had put in its announcement" about the deployments on Monday evening, Mr. Boucher said.
"The Ambassador took the opportunity at that time to register our concerns once again," he said.
Mr. Boucher and Mr. Fitzwater both said they had no information to indicate that the Soviet troops intended to go beyond their avowed purpose of rounding up draft evaders. "We believe, however, that some actions of the kinds reportedly planned could trigger violence or bloodshed," Mr. Boucher said.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Petition Is Filed by Pan Am To Get New Loans

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
Pan American World Airways, nearly out of cash, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday. Pan Am, the nation's pioneer in commercial aviation, is the third of the nine largest United States carriers to seek such protection from creditors in the last 22 months.
The airline will continue to fly and the filing will not affect customers, said Thomas G. Plaskett, the company's chairman and chief executive. 
 The filing, under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, was necessary because Pan Am, which is struggling to avoid liquidation, is seeking $150 million from United Airlines and the Bankers Trust Company, as a loan against the planned $400 million sale of its London routes and other assets to United. Pan Am sought Chapter 11 protection to persuade United and the bank to help it, since bankruptcy law puts lenders who give money after a filing ahead of other creditors in receiving repayment.
Pan Am needs the money from the route sale to United to help it survive the winter, when there are fewer passengers. In addition, high fuel prices and a weakening economy are hurting the entire airline industry.
Pan Am still faces a short-term hurdle: before Pan Am can get the $150 million loan, the bankruptcy court must approve the London route sale. There is also a long-term obstacle: Pan Am needs the approval of the British Government to complete the sale. It has already received $110 million from United for two Boeing 747-200 aircraft and its San Francisco operations, and it would get the remaining $290 million after obtaining Britain's approval.
The airline hopes to use the money to build a hub at Frankfurt and expand service to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The carrier would also keep its Latin American routes, which have been profitable.
Continental Airlines, the nation's fifth-largest airline, filed for bankruptcy protection last month, and Eastern Airlines, which is smaller, filed in March 1989. Both airlines are still flying and are under the protection of the court.
Pan Am, the seventh-largest United States carrier, handles about 19 million passengers a year, flying to about 100 destinations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa.
It also operates the Pan Am Shuttle, which provides hourly service between New York and Boston and between New York and Washington. Mr. Plaskett said that the shuttle was for sale and that two parties were interested. He did not name them, but it has been reported that Northwest Airlines has been negotiating with Pan Am for the shuttle.
 
In Regulated Times
 Pan Am, founded in 1927, prospered and grew when the industry was highly regulated; it had a monopoly on international travel until World War II. Its management excelled at lobbying in Washington and conducting diplomacy with other countries, which helped to develop Pan Am's status as the United States' almost-official airline. It is the carrier that inaugurated service across the Pacific, helped to ferry soldiers and equipment during World War II, ordered the first Boeing 747 and was widely regarded for its Clipper service.
But its management had trouble with the competitive pressures brought by deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 and the growth of other carriers on routes Pan Am had long dominated.
Close to bankruptcy by 1981, Pan Am began a decade of selling assets, including its headquarters building, which straddles Park Avenue in New York, to make up deficits, and sought concessions from its unions to cut expenses.
The fortunes of the carrier improved for several years but were dashed after terrorist attacks in 1986 and 1987 discouraged travel abroad. Pan Am had to sell the Pacific routes it had pioneered to United for $750 million.
 
Explosion Over Scotland
 No sooner had Mr. Plaskett begun to improve the airline's planes and service when a Pan Am jumbo jet was destroyed by a bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing 270 people. Mr. Plaskett estimated that the disaster cost Pan Am about $250 million in bookings in 1989.
Mr. Plaskett began to look for a strong airline to merge with Pan Am, but has not found a partner.
The sharp rise in aviation fuel prices during the Persian Gulf crisis has hurt Pan Am more than other carriers because many of its planes are older and less efficient. The carrier's cash is down to about $30 million, a very small amount by industry standards.
In its filing yesterday, Pan Am listed assets for the parent company, which is included in the petition, of $438 million and liabilities of $89 million as of Sept. 30. But its airline subsidiary had $2.6 billion in liabilities and $1.6 billion of assets. The unit's liabilities included $412 million in secured debt, $381 million in unsecured debt and more than $1.6 billion of other claims.
The Standard & Poor's Corporation listed the corporation's current assets as of Sept. 30 at $1.33 billion and current liabilities at $621 million.
Pan Am shares fell 37.5 cents, to 75 cents each, in New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday. Standard & Poor's announced that Pan Am would be removed from the S.&P. 500 stock index today and replaced by Blockbuster Entertainment, the largest operator of video rental stores.
 
Loan Faces Hurdles
 Pan Am must overcome some hurdles before it can get its hands on the $150 million from United Airlines and Bankers Trust. Judge Cornelius Blackshear of the United States Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York is handling the Pan Am bankruptcy filing and must approve the route sale. Judge Blackshear has scheduled a hearing on the issue for tomorrow.
Pan Am was helped yesterday when the Department of Transportation gave preliminary approval to the sale of its London routes. But in earlier talks the British Government said it wanted important concessions from the United States in return for allowing two strong carriers, United Airlines and American Airlines, to come into Heathrow and compete with British Airways. American Airlines has an agreement to buy the London routes of Trans World Airlines.
Talks are scheduled in Washington on Monday and Tuesday.
If Pan Am cannot secure the money from United, some analysts say, it probably could not keep operating and would face liquidation.
Paul Karos, the airline analyst for First Boston, said it had been impossible for Pan Am to keep up with bigger carriers like American, Delta and British Airways, with their newer planes and improved service on the Atlantic routes. "From food to interiors, Pan Am did not have the funds to keep up with competitors," he added.
Even if it can reorganize under Chapter 11, he said, Pan Am will have to align itself with a big carrier to get a strong domestic route system to feed its international flights and to build the resources to revamp its fleet.
Mr. Plaskett said an offer by Carl C. Icahn, the chairman of Trans World Airlines, was not considered to be workable. Mr. Icahn had sought to buy Pan Am and provide a loan to enable it to operate until it completed the sale of the London routes. Mr. Plaskett said that Mr. Icahn had offered only about half the amount offered by United and that other terms were not acceptable.
Pan Am's bankruptcy filing, following those of Eastern and Continental, highlights the growing role of bankruptcy proceedings in the airline industry, said Russell Thayer, a former president of Braniff Airways Inc. who is now an airline consultant.
 
Not Afraid of Bankruptcy
 Airline executives used to avoid bankruptcy court for anything short of liquidation. "In the old days you wouldn't do it because you thought people wouldn't fly" such a carrier for fear it would skimp on maintenance, Mr. Thayer said. But Eastern, which filed for protection almost two years ago, has continued to attract passengers.
Pan Am's bankruptcy filing will have a large effect on other carriers only if it leads to liquidation, which will probably not happen immediately, airline executives and other industry experts said.
Pan Am's international experience is an asset that is hard to quantify but is very valuable, said Uli Baur, the vice president for aircraft fleet management at Simat, Helliesen & Eichner Inc., a large aviation consulting firm.
If Pan Am stops operating for any reason, its successor or acquirer may find it hard to rebuild market share, he added. "In the past, whenever U.S. carriers went on strike, it was always very hard for the U.S. carriers to regain the market share they lost."
But in the long run, the more profitable domestic carriers may prove tougher competitors because they have more money to invest in new planes and terminals. Pan Am has suffered from a recent image of poor service aboard aging planes.
 
Pension Agency's Claims
 Pan Am said the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Government agency that insures certain corporate pension funds, was its largest unsecured creditor, with $490 million in contingent claims.
Other big creditors listed by Pan Am were S. G. Warburg S.A. and Soditic S.A., acting as agents for $40 million in liquidated claims. Other large unsecured creditors include the IBJ Schroder Bank and Trust Company, as trustee of $165 million of 9 percent convertible senior subordinated debentures; Midlantic National Bank as trustee for $130 million of 15 percent senior debentures due in 2004 and also for $100 million of 13.5 percent senior debentures due in 2003.
Pan Am, like other American carriers, has flown troops and materiel to Saudi Arabia as part of the military buildup there. In its court filing it said it had flown close to 100 missions in support of the Middle Eastern operations.

HEADLINE: Thoughts After Layoffs: Making Do and Moving

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT WORTH, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Scott Korgel glanced back at the hulking brick building where, minutes earlier this morning, he and more than 2,500 other engineers, technicians and office workers were ordered to clear out their desks and leave for the last time the top-secret development site for the Navy's A-12 attack aircraft.
"There is a lot of depression in that building this morning," said Mr. Korgel, who carried a box crammed with papers and books. A mechanical engineer with seven years' experience at the General Dynamics Corporation plant here, Mr. Korgel and 3,317 other company employees were laid off a day after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney canceled the $57-billion program for the carrier-based stealth aircraft. 
 About 800 of those employees worked in a large building not far from Mr. Korgel's.
"I'll be O.K. for awhile," Mr. Korgel, 32 years old, said. "But for others who have just one income, a wife and two kids, the unemployment check is not going to buy food and do everything else. People are calling their mortgage companies, saying they don't know when they can make another payment, and some are honestly worried about being homeless."
Mr. Korgel said his wife, Rina, a tooling engineer in the nearby General Dynamics plant, said they believed that her job was safe. But he said he was certain that he and most of the other laid-off workers would have to look outside Texas to find jobs that pay as well as the ones at General Dynamics.
The company told its employees not to talk to reporters, and outside the plant today many of them, particularly women, refused to discuss their feelings.
 
Severe Blow to Economy
 The sudden, and largely unexpected, loss of the A-12 program will cut as many as 10,000 jobs and as much as $500 million in trade from the Fort Worth economy, local economists say. Retailers, service companies and home owners will share the blow from lost sales and customers and declining home values, as hundreds of houses come onto the market, especially near the General Dynamics plant on the city's West Side.
Moreover, local government agencies will have to deal with falling real-estate taxes and receipts from sales. Some economists said the A-12 decision would pack an even greater punch if, as they feared, other military cutbacks sweep through the weapons-related industry in North Texas.
"This is not an isolated event, but symptomatic of a longer-term problem for the country," said Don C. Reynolds, an economist here. "There is pain in perestroika, and the A-12 cancellation is part of the pain. Any area that gets major defense-spending dollars should be prepared."
Military contractors in North Texas received $4.5 billion from the Pentagon in 1990, he said.
 
Good-Paying Jobs
 The job losses from the A-12 will increase the unemployment rate in the Fort Worth area by at least a full percentage point this year, Mr. Reynolds said. The rate rose to 6.1 percent in November after averaging less than 5 percent through most of 1990.
More than 2,500 salaried workers were among the 3,318 layoffs today, General Dynamics said. Those jobs paid an average $35,000 to $40,000 per person, and similar jobs will be hard to find in the Fort Worth area, said Bernard Weinstein, an economist at the University of North Texas in Denton.
The economies of Fort Worth and its larger neighbor 40 miles to the east, Dallas, have slowly improved in the last three years after being badly shaken in 1986 and 1987 from the region's worst economic downturn since the Great Depression.
American Airlines expects to add 4,000 workers when its aircraft maintenance plant opens next year at Alliance Airport, a joint project of the City of Fort Worth and the family of H. Ross Perot, the Dallas billionaire. Matsushita Electric Industrial Company, the giant Japanese company, is studying the area for a large manufacturing site that would eventually employ 7,000 people.
Ronald G. Steinhart, chairman and chief executive of Team Bank Inc., the largest bank with headquarters in Fort Worth, said he was optimistic that many of the former General Dynamics workers would not have to leave the area to find jobs.
 
More Diversified Economy
 General Dynamics, based in St. Louis, is the Fort Worth area's largest employer, with 27,100 employees at the end of 1990. The area, which includes the medium-size city of Arlington, has 693,000 employed workers.
"We have diversified our economy," Mr. Steinhart said, "and we have already worked through most of our problems. Absorbing all of these jobs is not something we can do overnight. But we are the best prepared of any time recently to do it, and certainly better prepared than any other part of the country."
Many of the newly unemployed A-12 workers are far less sanguine. "I wouldn't even consider looking" for jobs at other military contractors in North Texas, said Michael V. Schmidbauer, an expert in programming robots and other manufacturing equipment. "Texas Instruments is laying off, and they probably are in worse shape than we are."
Mr. Schmidbauer, 28, and his wife, Cathy, an accountant at a real-estate concern, earned more than $50,000 last year. With their second child due early next month, Mr. Schmidbauer said he was anxious about finding a new job -- outside the military weapons industry -- fast.
"I'll probably end up going to Seattle, to Boeing, and get into commercial aircraft," he said. "Of course, 4,000 other people from G. D. probably will, too."
But the Boeing Company might not hire many of the A-12 engineers. Paul Binder, a Boeing spokesman, said that the Seattle-based company's payroll declined last year by 2,000, to 104,000, after peaking in 1989 and that the company had not announced any hiring plans for 1991.
For Steven O'Donnell, a mechanical engineer, the A-12 cancellation marked the second time in three years he has lost a job as a result of Defense Department decisions. The Baldwin, L. I., native had gotten a job here after the Grumman Corporation lost out in bidding for the A-12 contract in 1988.
"Now I don't know what I'm going to do," Mr. O'Donnell, 30, said. "My wife's got a master's degree in teaching, but she's unemployed. I would recommend to anybody in college to stay out of the aerospace field. You can't get a steady job."
In St. Louis, the other major contractor on the A-12, the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, began layoffs of what it said would eventually total 5,000 employees. One of those dismissed, Mark Serra, 33, a plastic tooling worker, said that he would use the job-finding services that McDonnell, like General Dynamics, has offered, but that he was worried about a more pressing problem.
He and his wife, Linda, a nurse, learned last month that she was pregnant with their second child. Mrs. Serra's insurance does not cover the anticipated $5,000 cost for a hospital birth, and McDonnell officials told Mr. Serra that his family health insurance coverage would expire in a month.
Christopher Schildz, a spokesman at General Dynamics's corporate headquarters, said his company conducted a review with all A-12 employees today to account for classified documents before the Fort Worth building was closed.
"We really regret the disruption on the professional and personal lives of the people involved," Mr. Schildz said. "There were many good people working on that program."

HEADLINE: Purse Snatcher's Push Kills Woman With $1 in Subway

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
A 31-year-old Manhattan woman died following surgery last night after a purse snatcher grabbed her handbag containing $1 and pushed her between two cars of a subway train pulling out of an Upper West Side station, the transit police said.
A suspect with eight arrests for subway muggings was seized on a nearby street. 
 The woman, Grace Cheng, was trapped between the platform and a moving southbound C train at the station at 96th Street and Central Park West, said a transit police spokesman, Albert W. O'Leary. Her left leg was almost severed and her pelvis, left thigh and left arm were broken.
She was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, where she died at 10:15 P.M. after more than two and a half hours of surgery. Phyllis Goodman, a hospital spokeswoman, said Ms. Cheng suffered a heavy loss of blood from massive injuries.
Two unemployed security guards, Edwin Pacheco, 42, and Felix Burgois, 35, jumped onto the track after the train had crushed Ms. Cheng and lifted her to the platform, Mr. O'Leary said.
Minutes after the 10:45 A.M. attack, two plainclothes transit police officers arrested a New Jersey man as he rifled through Ms. Cheng's wallet near Columbus Avenue, Mr. O'Leary said. The officers were not aware of the purse snatching but said they had seen the suspect run out of the station with a wallet in his hand and had followed him.
The suspect, Brian Lawerence, of 3 Marshall Street in Irvington, N.J., was charged with robbery, assault and possession of stolen property after witnesses identified him as the attacker, Mr. O'Leary said. He has been arrested eight times in subway robberies. Mr. O'Leary said it was up to the Manhattan District Attorney's office to decide whether to upgrade the charges against Mr. Lawerence as a result of Ms. Cheng's death.
The suspect was taken last night to Bellevue Hospital Center for psychiatric evaluation, transit officials said.

A City Dinner for Greenmarket Farmers

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

 BODY:
THERE was an air of city slicker about the 50 farmers and members of their families done up in suits and ties, silk dresses and high heels who came to town on Sunday. For once, they had not awakened at 4 A.M. to load the truck with broccoli and apple cider and drive to the Greenmarkets. Winter is the time when most farmers, except for a hardy few with potatoes and baked goods to sell, take a break to examine seed catalogues.
The farmers assembled at the National Arts Club on Gramercy Park South to celebrate the 14th season of the urban farmers markets, to trade stories, express their concerns, eat dinner and, while they were at it, poke some fun at the powers that be. 
 "You didn't eat your tomato," said Henry Smith of Sycamore Farms in Middletown, N.Y., across the table to Barry Benepe, director of the Greenmarkets for the city's Council on the Environment.
Ellen Concklin, who, with her husband, Richard, owns the Orchards of Concklin in Pomona, N.Y., interjected, "Is that what that's supposed to be?"
The pale Florida tomato that adorned every plate was an embarrassment, like serving ballpark mustard in Dijon. But then, even boosterism could not enhance the appeal of the rutabaga from Hoeffner Farms in Montgomery, N.Y. Tough crowd.
"You've got yourself a raucous group," Jim Hightower, the guest of honor, who also left most of his rutabaga, told Mr. Benepe.
Mr. Hightower, who recently lost his bid for re-election as Texas Commissioner of Agriculture, is known in farming circles as the official who promoted farmers' markets and diversified agriculture and organic farming in his state.
The Greenmarket system received praise from the participants, although the meeting turned into something of a good-natured roast of Mr. Benepe. Mr. Hightower expressed amazement at Mr. Benepe's purple sports jacket, and the farmers chided him for his comment to the press last year that some of them made as much as $10,000 a day. "The low end of the range, $140, was left out of the quote," Mr. Benepe said.
But Bob van Nostrand, owner of Old Orchard Farms in Orient, L.I., who was among the first to participate in the program that operates in 18 citywide locations in season, put his appreciation very simply.
"We wouldn't be in farming today if it weren't for the Greenmarkets," he said.
Stanley Osczepinski, of S.&S.O. produce in Pine Island, N.Y., also credited the program for the growth of his operation.
"We used to grow 40 acres of onions," he said. "Now, because of the Greenmarket, we have 150 acres of vegetables. If there's money to be made, you have to diversify and change."
Vince D'Attolico, another Pine Island farmer who grows 96 kinds of vegetables, including 36 varieties of lettuce, and has had a stand in the Greenmarket since 1982, said, "A lot of onion farmers are going under left and right because they're so hard-nosed and reluctant to diversify."
Mr. D'Attolico, a former electrical contractor in New York City who moved out 12 years ago after having trouble collecting too many accounts, said he went into farming for the cash. "We're making a living and paying our bills," he said.
Leeks, garlic, cilantro, basil, exotic eggplants, sweet and hot peppers, finger potatoes, red lettuces and collard greens are some highly marketable crops that the New York State onion growers or the cabbage and potato farmers from Long Island have added in response to consumer demand.
In his remarks at the end of the dinner, Mr. Hightower cited an example of a Texas rancher with 7,000 acres in cattle and feed grains who came to Mr. Hightower's agency in desperation because he was unable to turn a profit.
"We discovered that Texans ate 100 million pounds of pinto beans a year and there were none being grown in the state," he said. "Now this farmer has expanded into 25,000 acres and the state of Texas has a new agricultural industry worth $29 million."
He also spoke of his enthusiasm for organic farming, which he said could result in higher yields, lower costs and less water use after the first couple of years, but not all of the farmers at the dinner were convinced.
"You can't do as successfully with apples, not in this damp climate," said Jim Lindsay of Idyllwood Orchard and Farm in Clifton Park, N.Y.
"I had customers who said they would love to buy organic apples," added his wife, Jenne. "So I brought a bushel of them down to the market and sold a total of two and a half pounds."
Like a number of other farmers, she said they do minimal spraying because chemicals are so expensive. "Consumers can be very demanding without understanding what's going on."
The beef and pork the Lindsays sell has not been treated with antibiotics and hormones. "It's a real selling point these days and it doesn't affect the quality," Mrs. Lindsay said.
Hall Gibson, owner of Ryder Farm which has existed for more than 200 years in Brewster, N.Y., and said preserving the family farm also meant caring for the environment. He added, "In this economy I think I'd rather be in farming than anything else."
Robert Lewis, marketing director for the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets, said the Greenmarket program has helped revitalize open downtown spaces. For many of the farmers the Greenmarkets have also put them back in contact with the people.
"In the Greenmarket you know who your customers are because you see them every week, so you have to care about what you sell them or they won't come back," Mr. Smith said.
"For a big grower in Florida or California, whether or not someone likes what he grows doesn't matter because he doesn't come in contact with the people who eat his products."

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
A 'New' Soviet Policy

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
Marlin Fitzwater reached near-highs of understatement and wishful thinking in responding to threats of a Soviet crackdown against deserters and draft-dodgers in seven rebellious republics. Although Administration officials are hoping for a Gorbachevian miracle, everything is much worse than the White House spokesman let on yesterday.
 Soviet-American relations stand on the edge of yet another new era, after only three years of the old one. The phase that appears to be coming will be marked by drift, mounting mutual unhappiness and no new breakthroughs in negotiation or cooperation. Moscow will be self-absorbed, but not anti-American. This is not what the Bush Administration said yesterday, or should say soon.
 
 Yesterday Mr. Fitzwater warned Moscow "to cease attempts at intimidation." True, Moscow has issued similar threats to round up errant recruits before and backed off, but it's not likely this time. The Gorbachev regime has just about run out of internal credibility and cannot afford to fail the armed forces again.
 Marlin Fitzwater also said the Administration was "still planning" on a Bush-Gorbachev meeting in February. But Mr. Bush simply cannot go if the specter of war still hangs over the Persian Gulf. And with Americans believing that Moscow has used the gulf crisis to blunt the U.S. backlash (much the way the Israeli, British and French invasion of the Suez Canal in 1956 provided the Soviets with cover to put down the Hungarian uprising), the summit meeting would be politically unwise for some time.
 Finally, Mr. Fitzwater said he did not believe that his criticisms would undermine Soviet support for the U.S. position in the gulf. That's probably correct, for the time being. But for reasons of Soviet domestic politics, Soviet-American relations seem poised to go downhill and enter the next phase.
 The question is what the new "new" Soviet foreign policy is likely to be. And what should be the American response?
 We may never know whether Moscow would have threatened the republics again in the absence of the gulf crisis. At the least, the gulf situation made that decision easier. But the point is that a crackdown is inevitable sooner or later.
 Mikhail Gorbachev is moving to the right. He has to because he is getting no support from the center and left. And to move right means necessarily to emphasize the central tenet of the military, the K.G.B. and the Communist Party faithful -- the Soviet Union must remain a union or a viable federation by force and blood, if need be, and even if the bloodshed severely strains relations with Washington. Unity will take precedence over all other foreign and domestic goals.
 Here is what that is likely to mean in practice:
 First, there will be a slowdown, if not a standstill, in making decisions on arms control and other cooperative efforts with Washington. It will be harder to get help from Moscow on places like Afghanistan and Cambodia. The new crowd will want to be seen as tougher in defending traditional Soviet interests than outgoing Foreign Minister Shevardnadze.
 Second, Soviet rhetoric will stiffen, but in a new way. The military will press to maintain its budget, but not by generating an "external threat." The Soviet public would not buy this line, and the military does not need to peddle it. The internal threat is sufficient. There is also likely to be a ratcheting up of anti-Zionist rhetoric. To many Soviet leaders, Moscow's support for the U.S. gulf policy symbolizes the rising influence of the Zionist lobby.
 Third, the new policy most definitely will not call for a reversion to the old hard line of the old cold war. Whatever the new crowd thinks about America's challenge to Soviet values, they know their nation is far too weak economically and politically to revive trouble with Washington. That means they are unlikely to do anything that could jeopardize existing treaties and commitments.
 The inward-turning of the Soviet Union will be ugly, whether or not Mr. Gorbachev orders a crackdown now. It will hinder and delay important advances toward reducing arms and solving third-world conflicts. It will unnerve those living on and near Soviet borders.
 If this phase in Soviet foreign policy comes to full bloom, it should be cause for dismay, not for a re-evaluation of U.S. policy. Marlin Fitzwater was right to skip the self-righteous hysteria, stand up for American democratic values and sound hopeful. That stance can be awkward politically, but it is correct.

HEADLINE: Let Every Depositor Sleep Securely

 BODY:
Mobs of depositors descended on the Bank of New England Friday after it announced it was virtually insolvent. Fearing a run that could spread to other banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation swiftly took over the big bank and two affiliates and assured their depositors -- including those with accounts exceeding $100,000 -- that all their money would be safe. The banks reopened Monday; not one depositor was hurt.
Contrast that with what happened two months ago. Federal regulators allowed little Freedom National Bank in Harlem to collapse. No Federal takeover. No blanket protection for large depositors. Several neighborhood charities lost hundreds of thousands in accounts they mistakenly thought were fully insured. 
 To depositors in small banks and the bank owners, these two episodes constitute a rank injustice. Put your money in a big bank and you're protected by a policy known as "too big to fail." But put a lot of money in a neighborhood bank and you could lose big. The remedy, say several members of Congress, seems obvious: Stop protecting large banks.
But realistically that won't -- and probably can't -- happen. The collapse of a big bank could trigger a succession of other bank failures and a temporary, though frightening, downward spiral of bank lending and consumer spending. That is not a risk the F.D.I.C. can permit.
A better answer is to offer complete insurance coverage for all deposits at small and large banks alike. And to insure that banks don't mishandle these insured deposits, there must be new, stringent regulatory safeguards.
The threatened collapse of the Bank of New England set off a contagious round of withdrawals from good and bad banks alike that threatened the local economy. Even a healthy bank in Rhode Island had to be sent truckloads of cash from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston because fearmongering comments on a local radio talk show set off panicky withdrawals. And most withdrawals from the Bank of New England on Friday and Saturday were from accounts that were fully insured.
The F.D.I.C. reacted responsibly in stopping the New England bank run, cold. Now Congress has to find a way to protect the insurance fund, and ultimately taxpayers, from future insolvencies.
An upcoming Treasury Department report on banking reform will outline one answer: making banks more profitable by permitting them to open branches across the nation and underwrite securities. Another answer will be to rein in reckless bank investments by charging risk-taking banks more for deposit insurance and requiring them to hold more capital reserves.
The most important steps will be to improve accounting standards so that regulators are forewarned of insolvencies, and to tighten regulatory powers so that shaky banks can be prevented from extending new loans.
With tighter supervision and safeguards, the F.D.I.C. could safely lift the present $100,000 cap on insured accounts. Any depositor who wants an insured account -- and is willing to accept the lower interest rates that such accounts pay -- could have it. That way every depositor could become too big to fail, and could sleep securely no matter what fears are mongered on radio talk shows.

HEADLINE: Why War Is Irrelevant

BYLINE: By Roger Morris; Roger Morris was a staff member of the National Security Council in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations.

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
As Secretary of State James Baker meets the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, hopes rise that the talks will amount to more than a repetition of the public postures of the two sides. In an era suspicious of secrecy, millions wish devoutly for a hidden agenda today in Geneva.
Yet, while the timetable clicks on inexorably in the Persian Gulf, there is a gathering sense of irrelevance about the stark options to which Washington is reduced. Neither war nor a last-minute diplomatic device will resolve the deeper issues that have brought us to this bleak rendezvous in the desert. Whatever the outcome in Geneva, the Administration's choices between battle and backdown betray an underlying futility -- and thus carry the seeds of future crisis. 
 Neither military action nor a status quo ante peace will remedy the incipient turmoil of Arabia, where the vast disparity between rich and poor creates bitter conflict within and among nations, where a U.S. "victory," by arms or ultimatum, will only strengthen belligerent forces like Iran and Syria while hastening anti-American upheavals.
Nor can Washington bomb or negotiate away the malignant oil dependence of Europe, Japan and the U.S., which makes this episode such a reckoning on past negligence. No smart weapons or shrewd bargains will alter the caprice of petroleum politics, or the inequities inflicted by the oil market on poor countries. Just as some showdown with Saddam Hussein will not release the resources needed for development and social peace in the Middle East, it will waste precious billions amid a deepening economic agony in the U.S.
Nothing in President Bush's strategy promises a creative initiative on the anachronistic Israeli-Palestinian conflict, at once symbol and substance of the larger crisis. No success now envisioned by the White House, whether through blood or bluster, purges that poison, and will probably only deepen it.
Least of all do Mr. Bush's options genuinely serve the heralded new world order, the beckoning image of a post-cold-war consortium of nations in which the President has wrapped his venture, and for which thousands of Americans may soon die. With its preponderance of U.S. forces in front of token, rear-guard allies, the martial assembly in the gulf may be the precedent for future Punic expeditions by the Pentagon, but scarcely for a new peacekeeping coalition.
Washington's corridor cajolery and economic-political blackmail, simply to gather resolutions and fig-leaf contingents, have hardly lent fresh legitimacy to the U.N. In its reflexive resort to Great Power extortion, the White House squandered a chance for authentic progress toward multilateral responsibility in a new era.
It is not merely that American men and women constitute a de facto mercenary force for the Germans, Japanese, Saudis and gulf sheiks, or that the Soviets, Chinese and others are absent. Just as national units of the gulf force cannot even talk to one another effectively in the field, western diplomacy has been fractured. The European Community, like the Arabs before them, is trying desperately to mount a mediation behind Washington's posturing and media polemics.
The gulf alliance reflects a sadly outmoded concept of collective security. There is no true collection of interests, no secure understanding of the irrelevance of both the old violence and the old diplomacy in a vastly changed international landscape.
No lesson taught the Iraqis seems likely to correct the deep-seated irresponsibility of the regime in Washington: Nothing will erase the fateful prelude to crisis -- a U.S. that had armed and subsidized Iraq for a variety of wanton purposes, that failed for bureaucratic reasons to try to deter aggression months before it happened, that ignored multiple warnings of invasion and left its unalerted citizens to become hostages.
On the eve, the Administration all but diplomatically acceded to the Iraqi attack. Then, in propaganda extraordinary even by the usual standards of political hypocrisy, it sought to incite both national idealism and native chauvinism by labeling its recent client another Hitler.
Imagine the alternatives: a U.S. that had not cynically armed one more dictator nor rendered itself an energy hostage in the greed of the 1980's; a Washington no longer culpable in profiteering and inequity in world resources, a President dedicated to statesmanlike lifting of the Arab-Israeli curse with genuine international initiative, a world in which 400,000 Americans need not be in the gulf because a principled foreign policy was there before them.
Instead, it is to the Bush Administration -- without effective check or balance because of the foreign policy abdication of Congress -- that America and the rest of the world will still be prey, whatever happens in the next few weeks. Perhaps that is what makes Washington's expected victory in the Persian Gulf already so Pyrrhic.
The ultimate irony is that the crisis presents a chance to deal with fundamental challenges of the post-cold-war world. In the grim concentration of global attention, these last days of peace afford an opportunity like no other in this century, and a singular moment for U.S. statesmanship.
A comprehensive and farsighted American peace effort would begin with authentic negotiations with Baghdad, not to reward aggression but to see it in proportion and to look beyond to ethnic, territorial and economic grievances dating to the Ottoman Empire. Iraq would be given equitable national treatment on disputed petroleum and access to the gulf. Kuwaiti sovereignty would be restored under U.N. auspices with an end to predatory oil practices. U.S. and allied armies would be withdrawn in favor of U.N. buffer forces. The price of Iraq's violence would be the dismantling of its threatening arsenals, though part of a larger regional settlement in which concessions would be security for all sides.
Washington would let the European Community take the lead on the Palestinian issue, recognizing the Europeans' stake and credibility as well as setting a precedent for shared responsibility. Simultaneously, every resource of American diplomacy would be applied to forging a united Arab commitment to settlement, to ridding Israel of its indispensable enemy by pan-Arab demilitarization, on the model of Mikhail Gorbachev's arms initiatives toward the U.S.
To Israel the U.S. would pledge, by a joint resolution of Congress, that any invasion of its pre-1967 territory (excluding Gaza) would be equivalent to an attack on the U.S., requiring our full defense. We would urge the U.N., and particularly the Soviet Union, to join us. But with or without their participation, the U.S. commitment would be unequivocal.
If Israel failed to join promptly in European-sponsored negotiations, it would be the U.S. position that our principled support does not extend to mutual suicide, and that Israel would be economically sanctioned like any other international obstructor.
To the Palestinians, the U.S. would pledge its matching commitment to the establishment and integrity of a sovereign state on the West Bank and in Gaza, in return for an immediate end to the intifada and prompt settlement negotiations. As with Israel, Palestinian hostilities under any guise would bring new, U.S.-sponsored international sanctions.
Washington would lead a world consortium to provide special aid to Jordan, and technical and educational assistance to Palestine, enabling them to gain their peaceful equilibrium. Civil rights of Arab citizens in Israel and Jewish citizens in Palestine, along with the multicultural status of Jerusalem, would be enforced by the U.N., a first act of the new world order.
The U.S. and other wealthier nations would press for a new Middle East commonwealth -- adama tziburit in Hebrew, al-tharwa al-oumoumiya in Arabic, the ancient, concept of a shared land and resources, economic and spiritual. A regional development bank would equitably redistribute from rich Arab nations to poor, away from chaos toward equity and vested interests in peace. The U.S. would support a Middle Eastern community, Arab and Jew, no less than it supported European unity, and for similar historical reasons.
A Middle East demilitarization conference, nuclear and conventional, would be convoked by U.S. leadership through the U.N., on the principle of "trust but verify," with international inspection of all states. Regional arms control would parallel U.S.-Soviet-European arms reductions.
The White House would launch at home a program for energy diversification and alternative fuels, aimed not only at domestic realignment but also at international conservation, conversion, and planetary management of scarce resources, environmental hazards and imbalances in development. That -- not the anachronistic and unavailing punishment of Iraq -- would give meaning to the words new, world and order.
If only the rhetorical fictions of politics, the false practicalities and irrelevant experiences did not impede such a breakthrough. If only an American President, letting a petty dictator claim what he will in a small corner, could move confidently beyond to build a legitimate peace and receive his own rightful credit.

HEADLINE: World Farmers Would Gain by Cut in Subsidies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The World's Farmers Reject Trade Plan," Lement Harris's Dec. 20 letter, should have been headlined "World's Richest Farmers Reject Trade Plan." Mr. Harris groups northern and southern farmers together as the victims of any General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade round to reduce protectionism in agriculture. This is contradictory and erroneous.
True, dropping levels of support in agriculture would cause some northern farmers to go out of business. However, southern farmers in less developed countries, those who do not enjoy heavy subsidy, would benefit from reduction in agricultural world protectionism. It would level the playing field in their favor by forcing heavily subsidized farmers in industrial countries to become competitive or be forced out of world markets.
Mr. Harris refers to farmers in North Dakota selling loaves of bread for 5 cents each to illustrate the farmer's pathetic share of a $1.50 loaf. This has little to do with domestic and international agricultural policy, but instead with the vast processing and marketing system operating in the United States and most other industrial countries. Attempting to connect the misfortune of some 6,000 farmers in North Dakota who have been forced out of business because of lower prices to the GATT proposal is absurd. Dropping levels of support might slow or reverse this trend, bringing new markets to wheat producers and drawing higher prices for these agricultural products.
Mr. Harris states that we should not be surprised if some American farmers sent a letter of thanks to the presidents of France and Germany. Thanks for what? For denying access to markets in Europe for United States grain and beef, along with many other commodities that United States and third world farmers produce more efficiently than those in France or Germany? Or maybe for contributing to the losses incurred by those 6,000 North Dakota farmers by subsidizing and dumping their excess supply exports into third country markets?
Mr. Harris mentions as opposed to free trade Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Indonesia and Malaysia, members of the Group of 15. These countries are fervent advocates of free agricultural trade and against protectionism that distorts the flow of agricultural commodities. There is continuous support for GATT and free trade from the Group of 15.
A document released during its meeting last June states: "We are concerned that some industrialized countries continue to heavily subsidize farm production and agricultural exports which deprive developing countries of fair and competitive market opportunities. We therefore support steps to reduce, if not to eliminate, such agricultural trade-distorting subsidies."
Thus, while southern countries bemoan low world prices for raw agricultural products, they see protectionism as contributing to low prices and the GATT as a potential saving force.

HEADLINE: World Farmers Would Gain by Cut in Subsidies;
Blame Europe

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Why the Trade Talks Fizzled" (Op-Ed, Dec. 20), Sir Roy Denman, former head of the European Community mission in Washington, dem
onstrates a nifty two-step in suggesting reasons for the failure of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations in Brussels. Mr. Denman attributes the outcome to a falling economic tide and exaggerated expectations. But neither argument washes.
The breakdown in Brussels developed when the European Community, supported by Japan and Korea, stonewalled appeals by the rest of the world to discipline their trade-distorting agricultural export subsidies and to open their agricultural markets further.
Agriculture has been debated in previous GATT rounds over at least two decades, under varying economic conditions. It is not economic travail that has prevented the development of international rules in this area comparable to what has evolved in the GATT for industrial goods. It is the lack of political will, particularly in Western Europe. If anything, the danger of a global recession should have helped stimulate a positive response by the European Community in Brussels, but regrettably that did not occur.
If expectations were exaggerated, it was the European Community whose views were out of line with those of most of the world, including a host of developing countries. Realizing that the GATT needed to play catch-up in agriculture, nearly all other countries were prepared to undertake major reforms over the next decade. Though change is politically difficult, these countries, including the United States, were prepared to reduce export subsidies dramatically, expose their farmers to global competition and reduce their internal subsidy programs. The European Community, however, wanted to nibble only at the edges of reform.
If there were any negotiations at gunpoint in Brussels, they came from the European Community too -- saying to the rest of the world, "We want to protect our markets from your exports, we want to dump our surpluses on the world market, and we want to retain the policies that permit us to do so." That is trade policy at its worst, and the rest of the world will no longer tolerate it. It should come as no surprise that the European Community was isolated in Brussels.
Let's hope the European Community will yet find the political will to salvage these negotiations. Otherwise, all of us, including Western Europe, will pay a heavy price for failure.

HEADLINE: Marko Nikezic, Yugoslav Liberal Forced to Quit by Tito, Dies at 69

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER

 BODY:
Marko Nikezic, a former Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia who was considered the leading liberal politician of Serbia in the postwar era, died of intestinal cancer Sunday night in Belgrade. He was 69 years old.
In 1972, he was head of the Serbian Communist Party, the largest party formation in the country, when President Tito compelled him and dozens of his closest associates to resign after accusing them of "liberalism." Mr. Nikezic had advocated and fostered an independent press, a market-oriented economy and the "democratization of decision-making." 
 Tito's assault on the Serbian leadership was the climax of a campaign he had begun the previous year in the Croatian republic to remove all challengers to his authority. It had the effect of postponing the evolution of Yugoslavia as a whole, and Serbia in particular, toward a more democratic society until well after Tito's death in 1980.
Even though removed from the political scene, Mr. Nikezic remained, in the words of Aleksandr Nenadovic, a longtime associate, "the center of gravity" for Serbs seeking to revive their nation's democratic parliamentary traditions of the 19th century.
In retirement Mr. Nikezic became an accomplished sculptor, and an exhibition of his works in marble and wood is being planned in Belgrade.
 
Fought Nazi Occupation
 Soft-spoken and deliberate in his choice of words, Mr. Nikezic joined the Communist Party at 19 and became a Partisan guerrilla fighting the Nazi occupation in 1941. The German military command put a price on his head in posters distributed around Belgrade. He was subsequently decorated for bravery. His wife, Zora, was also a Partisan.
A former student of architecture, he entered the diplomatic service in 1951 and served in Egypt and Ethiopia. He was appointed ambassador to Prague in 1956 and was named ambassador to Washington in 1958 at 37.
He became Foreign Minister in 1965 and in the Prague Spring of 1968 journeyed to the Czechoslovak capital to praise the democratization process under way there. Following the Soviet bloc invasion of that country, he was elected chairman of the Serbian Communists.
His father, Petar, was an engineer; his mother, Suzanne, was French. He was born in Belgrade in 1921.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons, Branko and Zoran, and two grandchildren.

Stanley Expecting Drop in 1990 Net

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEW BRITAIN, Conn., Jan. 9

 BODY:
The Stanley Works, the hardware and tools supplier, predicted its earnings for 1990 would be down 5 percent to 8 percent. "Stanley fourth-quarter sales and earnings have been affected by the spreading economic weakness in the United States," said Richard H. Ayers, chairman and chief executive. The company has not yet released earnings for the fourth quarter or the year.
To offset lower consumer demand, the company is cutting staff through layoffs and attrition, a spokeswoman, Patricia R. McLean, said. The number of cutbacks was not specified. Stanley also moved to save money through worker furloughs over the holidays. In 1989, Stanley earned $117.7 million, or $2.71 a share, on sales of about $2 billion.

Help for Canada's Nuclear Industry

BYLINE: By Matthew L. Wald

 BODY:
THE last time Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. had a foreign order for a nuclear reactor was in 1981, when Romania promised payment in everything from strawberries to underwear. Although Romania eventually paid what it promised, it ran out of money and left the plant half-finished.
Stories of unfinished projects have become typical in the hard times that have hit the nuclear reactor industry in the last 15 years. But a recent order from Korea has revived hopes at Atomic Energy that its business has not fully disappeared. 
 Very few countries have broken ground on new plants recently, and export orders have been rarer still. Atomic Energy's last order before Romania's was from Ontario Hydro in the mid-1970's. That is about the same time that American manufacturers saw their last domestic orders (not counting orders for more than 100 reactors canceled before completion).
American companies have had somewhat better success in the world market. In 1987, the Tokyo Electric Power Company agreed to buy two advanced models from the General Electric Company; Combustion Engineering Inc., now a subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri A.B., sold two to South Korea, and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation won an order from Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board.
Japan, South Korea and Indonesia are the current export targets of reactor makers. Atomic Energy of Canada also thinks an order may come from the Netherlands.
Canada has found exports harder in part because of the unique type of commercial reactor it builds. But while its Candu system -- so named because it uses deuterium in the reactor process -- is often a hard sell because of its uniqueness, it has advantages in sustaining nuclear fission.
American reactors use uranium that has been painstakingly enriched, carrying three times as much fissionable material as is found in nature. The Candu runs on natural uranium, which attracted the Romanians, who would have had to send their uranium to the Soviet Union for enrichment.
The Korea Electric Power Corporation, the Government-owned national utility that gave Atomic Energy of Canada an order recently, was attracted to the Canadian design by this and two other features: The Candu can be made to run on leftover uranium from some of Korea's existing plants. And the Candu can operate nearly continuously, because it can be refueled while running.
Electricity demand is rising in South Korea bynearly 15 percent a year, which implies a doubling in five years. "They have no coal, no oil, no gas and no hydro," said Dr. Stanley R. Hatcher, president and chief executive of Atomic Energy of Canada. "Nuclear is sure to be a big part."
The South Korean company already has a Candu, Wolsong 1, built in 1983. It began operating only 61 months after construction started, half what reactors in the United States take to build, and in 1986, it held the world record for reliability.
Wolsong 2, as the new 700-megawatt reactor will be designated, is to be completed by 1997. The price is $600 million (Canadian), of which one-third will go to South Korean subcontractors and the rest to Canadian companies.
The order may be even more important to the Canadians than the Koreans. Aside from providing $400 million (Canadian) in hardware and service contracts -- signed in Seoul last month -- the project will keep skills alive, Dr. Hatcher said.
"This Korean sale is an important element of keeping the industry viable, and keeping the work in the shops," he said. The sale means 2,000 jobs for four years and another 5,000 created indirectly.
But surviving another nine years without an order "would be hard," Dr. Hatcher acknowledged. The plan of Atomic Energy of Canada and others is to hold on long enough for a turnaround in the business. It is hoped that electrification of growing economies like South Korea's, combined with fear of global warming induced by burning coal or other fuels, will spur new reactor orders.
Ontario Hydro's plans for 10 new reactors is in doubt because of a change of the provincial government last year. But Atomic Energy has a nearby market in mind: It is discussing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission how to license a small Candu reactor in the United States. Dr. Hatcher said he expected the United States to have a nuclear revival, adding, "We hope to be there."

Sequent Shares Drop by 33.3%

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Shares in Sequent Computer Systems Inc. plummeted today after the company said its earnings for the fourth quarter, which ended on Dec. 29, would be lower than in the corresponding period last year.
Sequent, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., had been the last important computer manufacturer with uninterrupted growth in earnings. Its shares closed today at $11.50 in over-the-counter trading, down $5.75 a share, or 33.3 percent.
While Sequent expects revenue for the quarter to be at least 50 percent higher than the $47.8 million it reported for the fourth quarter of 1989, net earnings are expected to be 10 cents to 20 cents a share, compared with 23 cents in the quarter last year.
The profit decline was caused by a combination of three things, Casey Powell, Sequent's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. These were a drop, from $16 million in the third quarter to below $10 million in the fourth, in the company's original- equipment manufacturing business, in which Sequent computers are resold by the Unisys Corporation; the softening of the economy, and the transition to a new product line.
Mr. Powell said he expected the first quarter of 1991 to be difficult also. "I think we're going to come out of this healthy," he said. "I don't think we're going to come out of it unscathed."

HEADLINE: Waterville Valley Journal;
Snow Isn't Just a Four-Letter Word

DATELINE: WATERVILLE VALLEY, N.H., Jan. 9

 BODY:
Every night since early November, the residents of this resort community nestled in the White Mountains have waited, eyes upturned, for a hint of the winter storms that are their livelihood.
None of them can recall waiting quite so long. 
 Like other ski areas throughout New England, Waterville Valley is grappling with a dismal lack of snow. The trace amounts of snow that have fallen on the region for much of the season have quickly disappeared, leaving trees, roadsides and mountaintops unseasonably bare. The several inches that fell today made the scenery look better, but it will take more than that to turn the season around.
With two big back-to-back rains on Dec. 23 and 24, the countryside did not look at all like Christmas. A second pair of rainstorms on Dec. 29 and 30 insured that it did not look like New Year's either.
Those who live here year-round and depend on skiers for their income say the weather, coupled with the sluggish economy, has dealt a serious blow to their collective psyche. "Everyone's in survival mode," said Russell Roth, who was recently laid off from the Waterville Valley ski resort and now works at the Great American Ski Renting Company in nearby Campton. "We're trying not to get too depressed."
Much of Northern New England, which usually receives 25 to 45 inches of snow from late November through the second week of January, has had only 11 to 20 inches, said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist with the Pennsylvania State University Weather Communications Group.
The culprit, Mr. Gadomski said, is a high pressure system off the coast of Florida, which sends pockets of warm air up the East Coast and which snuffs out big snowstorms in their infancy. That system has kept many of Waterville's usual patrons, and their wallets, at home in the Boston area, 130 miles south of here.
Bob Fries, the vice president and general manager of the Waterville Company, which runs the resort, said its revenue is $1 million lower than last year at this time, when the resort was the beneficiary of several bountiful snowfalls.
"No one likes to come out of the holiday period down a million dollars in revenue," said Tom Corcoran, the founder and chief executive officer of the Waterville Company. "But we've got a good chance at making that up, depending on the weather."
Mr. Corcoran's optimism looked justified over the weekend, when several thousand skiers crammed more than half of the resort's 48 trails, which were miraculously covered with a hard-packed cover of what appeared to be snow. Even the giant evergreens bordering the trails were encased in thick white coats, though the surrounding peaks were nothing but grass, rocks and patches of mud.
The skiing was possible because Waterville, like most ski areas in the Northeast, has spent millions of dollars over the last 20 years on a mechanical system that creates snow.
The process, which is simple but expensive, combines water and compressed air. When the mixture is blown out of huge cannons set at strategic points around the mountain, the result is a simulated snowfall, as long as the air temperature is less than 29 degrees.
Though the weather has been cold enough in the last week for snow to be manufactured virtually round the clock, Waterville is struggling to persuade skiers in the Boston area that the resort is open for business. That's because of what the industry calls the "backyard syndrome": if a skier does not see snow in his backyard, he will be reluctant to venture north and spend $35 a day for a ski-lift ticket.
To bring skiers back, Waterville has been broadcasting commercials on Boston television stations that feature Mr. Corcoran skiing with a backdrop of white-covered trails.
The commericals may be working: Waterville sold 17,500 lift tickets from Dec. 31 to Jan. 6, a thousand more than in the same period a year ago, said Mr. Fries, the general manager.
But the "backyard syndrome" can be insidious. As she prepared to board Waterville's chair lift Sunday, Susan Hunter of Bedford, N.H., said she had skied only twice this season, despite investing hundreds of dollars in a season pass.
"From the valley, you look up at the mountains and all you see are these brown patches," said Ms. Hunter. "We really had to motivate to get out here."
And once she got here, Ms. Hunter said she found that much of the powdery "machine made" snow had disappeared by noon, exposing the mountain's base, which in many places is a sheet of ice. By Sunday afternoon, many skiers were trying in vain to dig the edges of their skis into the hard base, which in some places was more conducive to skating than skiing.
As skiers scrambled around the base lodge here Sunday morning, donning parkas and pulling on hats, Greg Gostanian, 41, and his wife Kathy, 40, seemed oblivious. Sitting close to a big fireplace, a tall thermos of coffee their only companion, they said they were not skiing because the conditions were too icy.
"It's not worth it," said Mr. Gostanian. "We can live with it for now. But there's still the eternal optimism: all it takes is one storm."

HEADLINE: How 3 Embattled Builders Survive

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
With real estate prices falling and buyers treating the new-home market as if it had a wet basement and no rooms with a view, many builders are struggling to stay alive until the next upturn in sales.
Three home builders, operating in three different regions, have come up with survival strategies that seem to be working. 
 In New Jersey, K. Hovnanian Enterprises is pulling back from the overbuilt condominium market to concentrate on mid-priced houses in the central part of the state for baby boomers who are building their families and moving out of apartments.
In Southern California, Ira Norris has rethought his housing production system, from the first site plans to the last carpet tack, and is forcing supplier prices and his own profits down to where the market will buy. In Boston, Tony Green is working for the banks, finishing and selling developments that have been foreclosed.
"This is strictly a holding action," Mr. Green said. "We're just trying to keep our team together until the market comes back."
In a decade the country's home builders have seen their business go from the richest of times, in the mid-80's, to some of the bleakest of times. Some builders have gone back to their old standby, the home-improvement trade; others are wondering what they will do after completing the houses on order, and many have failed, judging from the falling membership of the National Association of Home Builders, which has tumbled to 158,000, from 161,000 last April.
In 1986, the industry's best year ever, 1.8 million single-family homes and apartments were built. In 1990, the industry put up 1.2 million single-family homes and apartments, the lowest level since the recession of 1981-82 and a drop in business from 1989 of 33 percent.
On Jan. 2, the Commerce Department reported that residential construction spending in constant dollars had dropped for the eighth month in a row to the lowest level since 1983.
"We have worked ourselves into a real recession," said Kenneth Colton, executive vice president of the home builders group. "The terminology you will hear our members use is that suddenly the door slammed shut."
The White House has predicted a short and mild recession. But with buyers already paying more for fuel and in taxes, and with war threatened in the Persian Gulf and lenders wary of making new real estate development loans, builders and industry analysts are pessimistic about an early upturn in their business. They point to the baby bust as evidence that the golden age of residential real estate, just ended, is unlikely to return.
Yet the market is not completely dead. An estimated 1.2 million new households are expected to be formed each year in this decade, down from 1.5 million a year during the 80's. And mortgage rates, at a three-year low, have begun to lift the rate of housing sales slightly in recent months.
 
A New Formula
 Mr. Norris, of Upland, Calif., looked at Southern California's booming population but slumping housing sales and prices and decided that the traditional housing development equation had to be rewritten. His new formula has made him a minor legend in the high desert east of Los Angeles.
Normally, developers like Mr. Norris secure the land and obtain construction permits and then ask for bids from subcontractors. Subcontractors then call door, window, plumbing and framing concerns for prices, add overhead, an allowance for breakage and theft, a profit goal and mail in a number.
Mr. Norris, a big builder who has put up more than 500 houses a year since he formed Inco Homes in 1976, decided to squeeze that process by forcing his subcontractors to negotiate for their materials. "The problem is that these subs are used to being quoted prices, and so they're lousy negotiators," Mr. Norris said.
 
A Matter of Survival
 For subcontractors, he said, this approach is a matter of survival. "We realized that housing contractors that don't concentrate on reducing their overhead and cutting their costs are not going to make it through this recession," Mr. Norris said. "So we told them that we would cut our profit and overhead if they would do the same, and that we would be able to build a house that the market would not pass by."
In addition, by putting 1,800 lots on 500 acres in the western Mojave desert town of Adelanto -- a hard, but not unheard-of, 100-mile commuting trip to Los Angeles -- he kept his land prices low.
The result of both strategies: a construction cost of $27 a square foot, compared with the normal $35 to $40 a square foot, and a two- to four-bedroom house that can be sold for $80,000 to $100,000, compared with $105,000 and up in the adjoining community of Victor Valley, said Mr. Norris, who has built more expensive houses in Los Angeles.
 
Quick Sales
 On Oct. 13, he put his first 55 houses on the market, and by nightfall had sold 47 of them. The remaining 8 were gone the next day, a Sunday, he said. Within a week, all 127 houses in his first phase had been sold, he said.
"He's selling them as fast as he can build them," said Patricia Chamberlin, the Adelanto town administrator.
Of the housing market, Mr. Norris said, "We're predicting a blood bath out there in '91." He added that with his new strategy "we are getting a lot of work and a lot of cash flow but not a lot of profit, but at least we'll be intact and still be in business when the recession ends."
And West Coast banks are still more open to lending to developers than those in the East. Mr. Norris raised 25 percent of the $32.6 million needed to build the 127 houses from an equity partner and the remainder from the Union Bank and the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles.
To ride out the slump, the Boston-based Green Company is working down its inventory and helping banks sell development projects that were foreclosed. In 1987, Green started 70 town houses that went on the market for upward of $240,000. It has seven left, and will soon have none, although it has had to give enticements to close many sales.
"I don't think there is a builder anywhere who isn't willing to do a little something for a buyer to make a deal happen," said Mr. Green, the company's vice president for marketing. "For one person, it may take adding wood floors, another may have to save some money. So you customize the plan a little to cut the costs for him."
The company, which built an average of 60 houses a year and was founded in 1964 by Tony's father, Alan, who is chairman, also has six projects to complete and sell in the Boston area for banks.
Each has required a distinct treatment aimed at overcoming what Mr. Green considers the toughest obstacle to sales these days: buyers' fear of getting a house that will lose value, as houses across the country have declined in value in recent months.
That is not only a matter of price. "It can be priced rock bottom, but if there's a rusting construction trailer or no landscaping or the roads aren't paved, they won't touch it," Mr. Green said.
 
The Impression of Value
 Builders can often add the impression of value to a whole development by investing more money in a few of the houses, Mr. Green said. Only 3 of 24 homes had been sold at the Arbors, a condominium development in Acton, Mass., when it was taken over by the lender, the Foxboro Savings Bank.
Hired to sell the remaining homes, Mr. Green's company thought the problem was that the floor plan, with two upstairs bedrooms, did not fit the project's high-end, $290,000 to $390,000 price range. The mostly older, second- or third-time buyers and empty-nesters who pay these prices often prefer to have master bedrooms on the ground floor, Mr. Green said.
But rather than reconfiguring all 19 of the unsold units, Mr. Green cut the price to $200,000 on all but 7 units. On those, he added 10-by-10-foot extensions to make room for a big downstairs bedroom, at an additional cost to the buyer of $35,000.
"That allowed us to present the unfixed-up home in a much more positive light, because it now appears to be, and is, quite a good deal compared to the fixed-up home," the builder said.
Ten additional condominiums have since been sold, nine of them the unaltered models.
More important, from the bank's point of view, the building permits, which are hard to get in the crowded and growth-conscious Boston suburbs, have increased in value for 36 additional units, offsetting the write-off of about 30 percent of the value of the development that the bank was forced to take to sell the units quickly.
And Mr. Green is counting on his alliances with banks serving him over the longer term. "If we do our job for the Bank of Boston or for Chase Manhattan now, those guys are going to remember us when the next run-up comes." Mr. Green added, "We hope they'll look at us and say, 'Hey, those guys can do it even when things are pretty bad.' "
 
'There Is Demand'
 The basic element of Hovnanian's strategy is to keep prices down.
"We have found that there is demand in the marketplace, but the key is that your product has to be priced properly, and that means lower prices," said Ara Hovnanian, president of the publicly held builder, which is based in Red Bank, N.J.
Mr. Hovnanian's company met this challenge in part by announcing last month that it would take a $19 million write-down on unsold properties in New Hampshire, New York and Florida, and auction the condominiums off at fire-sale prices. The write-down will probably produce a $14 million net operating loss for the year. The Hovnanian company, which became famous in the New York area by holding lotteries in the mid-80's for eager town house condominium buyers, is backing away from the overbuilt condo market to concentrate on the higher-priced housing market.

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
A Weak Outlook For Phone Giants

BYLINE: By Keith Bradsher

 BODY:
THE stocks of the nation's three main long-distance telephone companies all fell sharply last year after three years of strong gains, and some analysts say they are unlikely to recover soon because of concerns about the weakening economy.
Shares in the industry leader, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, fell 34 percent last year. The stock of the MCI Communications Corporation, the second-largest long-distance company, plummeted 55 percent. Stock of United Telecommunications Inc., the parent of U S Sprint, dropped 39 percent. 
 Three problems face the industry: slower growth in long-distance traffic, higher marketing expenses and the possibility of another price war.
For the last several decades, annual growth in long-distance has tended to equal the annual change in the nation's economic growth plus 7 to 10 percentage points. The Federal Communications Commission says the growth in traffic has been particularly robust during the recent economic boom, with an average annual increase of 12.9 percent from mid-1984 through mid-1990.
Now, some analysts forecast growth of as little as 7 percent this year. Long-distance use depends most directly on white-collar employees, who make the many weekday calls that pay for most of the cost of building and expanding the nation's telephone network. "Guys on the G.M. factory floor are not making calls from 8 to 5," said Joel D. Gross, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
White-collar employment has been an early and conspicuous victim of the current economic downturn. New York City accounts for a third of the nation's international calls and up to a fifth of its domestic long-distance calls, in large part because of the enormous reliance of its banks and brokerages on voice and data communications. These businesses are now contracting.
In interviews over the last three months, the chairmen of A.T.& T., MCI and United Telecom have each said they expect long-distance traffic to continue growing even if the economy slumps. "It has always been a growth industry, and it has only been a question of what level of growth," said William G. McGowan, the chairman of MCI.
Indeed, the last years in which traffic actually fell were 1931, 1932 and 1933, in the depths of the Great Depression, said Donald A. Sweeney, an economist at A.T.& T.
When the American oil industry slumped in the mid-1980's, oil companies increased their use of computer messaging over long-distance lines to replace more expensive corporate travel. Long-distance companies hope more companies will substitute telecommunications for travel this year.
Mr. McGowan, Robert E. Allen of A.T.& T. and William T. Esrey of United Telecom all pointed to international telephone traffic, which has been growing more than 20 percent a year, as a source of strength during any recession. The number of such calls grew quickly last year because many American businesses have strong overseas sales, and expansion should continue even during a recession, Mr. Allen said.The Federal Communications Commission's recent effort to drive down the fees charged by foreign monopolies for accepting international calls should make this business more profitable for American carriers, Mr. McGowan said.
But, according to the commission, American carriers collected $5.1 billion for international calls in 1989, or only about 10 percent of the industry's $52 billion in revenues. So analysts say the fee effort may not make a big difference.
At the same time, long-distance carriers increasingly offer big discounts to major companies on contracts that guarantee that the carrier gets most of the customer's traffic. Some corporations are cutting their long-distance expenses by as much as 20 to 30 percent with such contracts, said Berge A. Ayvazian at the Yankee Group, a telecommunications consulting company in Boston.
These corporations often rely on their own switching equipment to send their calls over another carrier if their primary carrier has technical problems, as when a broken cable disrupted A.T.& T.'s New York service on Friday.
If the growth rate of overall long-distance traffic does drop sharply this year, recent history indicates that each carrier, when its own traffic slows, will quickly respond with lower prices or increased spending on marketing. U S Sprint moved 400 employees into marketing after a disappointing second quarter last year. MCI, after a weak third quarter, said it planned to increase advertising this year. Extra spending on marketing trimmed the long-distance industry's profit margins last year.
MCI and A.T.&T. are now preparing for further struggles for market share in the first three months of 1991. "Here you have the two sides armed for war, ready to go after each other's heads in the first quarter, just as the economy's going downhill," Mr. Gross said. "If that isn't cause for concern, I don't know what is."

HEADLINE: New Impetus in Honda Car-Building Effort

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The Honda Motor Company, responding to "a number of socio-economic changes" that have complicated business, including the new Clean Air Act in the United States, announced today that it was intensifying efforts to develop vehicles that will set new environmental, energy and safety standards.
Honda provided few details, except to say it was working on a highly energy-efficient compact model that would be introduced "in the near future." The auto maker will also begin public testing of what it says is the world's first electric motorcycle this year in Japan. 
 Honda also announced it would create in Southeast Asia a fourth area for "self-reliant" automotive marketing and production, in addition to its centers in Japan, Europe and the United States.
What a spokesman characterized as Honda's "new direction" was outlined in a New Year's address and policy statement, delivered in Tokyo by Nobuhiko Kawamoto, who took over in June as Honda's president and chief executive.
Although Honda is one of Japan's smaller auto makers, it has produced some of the industry's most important engine technology, and therefore is closely watched by competitors. In the mid-1970's, Honda's CVCC engine, introduced in the Civic model, surprised the industry by meeting United States emission requirements without a catalytic converter or peripheral engine hardware. More recently, Honda engines have dominated Grand Prix racing.
 
Worldwide Strategy Pursued
 Rather than rely solely on imports, Honda has pursued a worldwide strategy of building separate companies for separate parts of the world that do their own consumer research and build and market their own vehicles. The company operates several plants and laboratories in North America.
Honda sold nearly one million Honda and Acura brand cars in the United States in 1990, surpassing the Chrysler Corporation as the No. 3 seller of cars. Mr. Kawamoto said the company's target for 1991 is one million.

HEADLINE: Toyota Set to Expand in U.S. Market

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 9

 BODY:
In a bid to expand in the United States market, the Toyota Motor Corporation today announced a two-seat sports coupe made in Japan but aimed at young Americans buying their first cars.
Robert McCurry, executive vice president of Toyota's United States sales arm, also told reporters today that he expects a decision within 60 days on whether the Japanese auto maker will build a full-size pickup truck for the United States market. 
 If Toyota decides to build a full-size pickup, it would mark the first attempt by a foreign auto maker to break into the profitable and high-volume market in the United States for large pickups, which so far has been the exclusive domain of Detroit's Big Three.
Mr. McCurry said he expects the new Paseo sports coupe, due to arrive in dealer showrooms by June, to add 35,000 car sales for Toyota in 1991 and 50,000 the following year, relatively modest increases compared with the 779,208 cars Toyota sold in the United States last year.
Toyota offers a more expensive sports car, the MR-2, which has a base price of $15,148, as well as the Celica, ranging from $12,700 to $19,200, and the Supra, whose base price is $23,800. The Paseo, which is derived from the company's subcompact Tercel, was conceived by Toyota's United States executives to appeal to a growing number of entry-level sports car buyers, particularly young men.
With a tentative price of about $9,500, Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. has positioned the Paseo to compete against other low-priced sports cars, including Honda's CRX, Hyundai's Scoupe, and Chevrolet's Geo Storm, which is manufactured by Isuzu for General Motors.
"The entry-level sporty car segment has grown dramatically in the last few years," said Christopher Cedergren, a market analyst for J.D. Power & Associates in Westlake Village, Calif. United States sales of sporty, fuel-efficient cars priced between $8,000 and $14,000 have blossomed from 111,000 units in 1989 to an estimated 178,000 in 1990, Mr. Cedergren said.
Toyota would need two years to bring out a full-size pickup, if it committed itself to the project, Mr. McCurry said. One problem Toyota faces, if it decides to sell large pickup trucks, is finding a plant where it can manufacture the vehicles. Although the company is doubling the size of its factory in Georgetown, Ky., all of the new capacity is already committed to expanding production of the compact Camry sedan, and the auto maker's Japanese plants are operating at full capacity.
Toyota sold 182,000 small pickup trucks in the United States last year, and will begin producing small pickups this summer at its joint-venture plant with the General Motors Corporation in Fremont, Calif.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Bank Seizure Stirs Hope

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 9

 BODY:
State business leaders and bank analysts believe this week's takeover by Federal regulators of Connecticut Bank and Trust, a subsidiary of the insolvent Bank of New England Corporation, could help Connecticut's economy if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank deposits, manages to sell the bank to a strong institution within a few weeks.
A new owner might loosen commercial credit, helping to slow the state's downward economic spiral. Connecticut Bank and Trust, one of the state's largest lenders, had curtailed lending over the last year. 
 "The action of the F.D.I.C. has helped clean up the situation to the extent that there will be a buyer, and that it will provide a little bit more lending capability," said Edward J. Deak, an economics professor at Fairfield University in Fairfield, Conn., and the Connecticut analyst for the New England Economic Project, a nonprofit forecasting group.
 
Calling In Loans
 But Peter M. Gioia, director of research for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, a trade organization based in Hartford, said that if the 135-branch New Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, as the bank was renamed by the F.D.I.C. on Sunday, remained unsold, the bank might have to call in loans to cover nonperforming assets, particularly real estate. "You now have a major New England bank that is not making any more loans," he said.
The bank lends to many of the companies based in the state, many of which say they will keep their accounts with the bank. As of Sept. 30, Connecticut Bank and Trust's loan portfolio was 28 percent commercial and industrial, 7 percent consumer, and 59 percent real estate and construction. The remaining 6 percent was made up of lending to the state and local municipalities and miscellaneous loans.
Since 1989, four other Connecticut banks and savings institutions have been taken over by other financial institutions in the state after becoming insolvent. They were National Industrial Bank of Meriden, Columbia Federal Savings Bank of Westport, Brooklyn Savings Bank of Brooklyn, Conn., and Community Federal Savings and Loan of Bridgeport.
Two other institutions -- the Charter Federal Savings and Loan of Stamford and Financial Federal Savings Bank of Hartford -- have been taken over by the Federal Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency in charge of the Government savings and loan bailout.
 
'A New England Problem'
 "It is statewide; it is probably a New England problem," said Mr. Gioia, also citing the closing of 45 banks and credit unions in Rhode Island last week. "It is happening in New Hampshire; it is happening in New Haven."
Although small and minority-owned businesses have apparently been especially hard hit by the credit squeeze, Diane Goodman, chairman of the business council of the Greater Hartford Chamber of Commerce, said the takeover of Connecticut Bank and Trust probably would not have a dramatic effect on most small businesses. "Small businesses go to small banks," she said.
The bank's larger commercial customers -- Connecticut-based companies like United Technologies, Ames Department Stores, Heublein Inc., Dairy Mart Convenience Stores and Cigna -- appear content to keep their funds at the bank, while the Government searches for a new owner.
"We are definitely optimistic," said Frank Colaccino, president of Dairy Mart, a chain of 1,200 stores based in Enfield, Conn., which plans to keep its commercial accounts with Connecticut Bank and Trust despite the Government takeover.
He said he was pleased with the F.D.I.C. guarantee of deposits of more than $100,000 and by the decision to leave the management of the 4,200-employee subsidiary in place. "From what I understand, C.B.T. was one of the stronger parts of the Bank of New England." he said.
 
Local Officials Optimistic
 Many municipal officials were also optimistic about the takeover. On Monday, the City of Hartford postponed a decision made on Friday to transfer $2 million to another bank.
And Tuesday, the State Commissioner of Banking, Howard B. Brown, rescinded a Jan. 4 order that gave the city 30 days to remove its transaction accounts from the bank.
The order had been issued because the bank fell below the requirement in a state law that says it must keep at least 3 percent of its assets in cash. A spokesman for the State Department of Banking, Dave Tedeschi, said today that the infusion of F.D.I.C. funds over the weekend gave New Connecticut Bank and Trust an equity-capital ratio that exceeded that level.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Prices Close Higher After Big Trading Swings

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices for precious metals futures fluctuated wildly yesterday, moving sharply lower in the morning on hopes for peace in the Persian Gulf and reversing direction after talks between the United States and Iraq failed to make progress.
Gold for February delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange plunged more than $10 an ounce in early trading as the war premium that built up in recent months was stripped away. Gold rallied in the afternoon, after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said nothing had come of his meeting with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq. 
 Gold settled 60 cents to 90 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in February at $393 an ounce, up 70 cents. The February contract traded as high as $394.50 and as low as $379.50. The near-month January contract rose 90 cents to close at $391.20.
 
Silver Is Lower
 Silver was 2 cents to 7 cents lower, with March at $4.175 an ounce. Platinum was $1.20 to $2.20 higher, with January at $408.40 an ounce.
"Everything keyed off the Baker and Aziz meeting," said Randolph Donney, a metals analyst for the Pegasus Econometric Group. "There was anticipation some deal was being cooked up. With no peaceful solution occurring, everything reversed."
Grain and soybean futures prices, meanwhile, closed mostly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Corn futures were lower on professional and commercial selling, in the wake of the announcement late on Tuesday that the United States had extended $530 million in feed grain credits to the Soviet Union.
Moscow has been allocated $900 million in short-term credit guarantees to buy American agricultural commodities.
The market reacted to ideas that the Soviets had already bought most, if not all, of the corn it wanted, analysts said.
Wheat futures showed modest gains after reaching contract lows in Tuesday's trading.
Over all, the market continued to be hampered by a lack of export business, analysts said.
Wheat was 1/2 cent to 2 1/2 cents higher, with March at $2.53 3/4 a bushel; corn was 3/4 cent to 1 cents lower, with March at $2.31 3/4 a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 2 1/4 cents higher, with March at $1.11 3/4 a bushel; soybeans were 1 1/2 cent to 3 cents higher, with January at $5.55 3/4 a bushel.
Livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, because of pressure from high slaughter levels and weak cash prices.
Pork futures soared on higher cash prices.
Live cattle were 0.35 cent lower to 0.15 cent higher, with February at 76.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.05 cent lower to 0.33 cent higher, with January at 88.80 cents a pound; hogs were 0.07 cent to 1.50 cents higher, with February at 51.40 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.08 cents to 1.93 cents higher, with February at 70.50 cents a pound.

Themes for '91: A Sense of Limits And Wistfulness

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Becoming Mayor during a recession was David N. Dinkins's first mistake. So it was no surprise that he referred almost wistfully this week to "a new beginning" as he and the Governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, each facing daunting deficits, delivered their ritual prognoses for the new year.
Mr. Dinkins, like the others, hopes somehow to transform economic adversity into opportunity. But he neglected to provide details of just what 1991 in New York City would be the beginning of. 
 In contrast, Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey finished his first year by acknowledging that he might have moved too quickly and not explained his goals adequately -- then he tried to regain the initiative by outlining new ones. (Mr. Dinkins failed to elaborate on why he might have moved too slowly.)
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is beginning his third term, demonstrated again that it is more difficult for a veteran incumbent to deliver bad news than for a fledgling (like Mr. Dinkins, Mr. Florio and like Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, who was inaugurated only yesterday). They inherited a legacy, as Mr. Cuomo had in 1983. Then, like this year, he faced the largest projected deficit in New York State's history.
Mr. Cuomo's predecessor, Hugh L. Carey, took office with the sobering pronouncement that the "days of wine and roses are over." For Mr. Cuomo, after eight years in office, to echo that theme risked derision for mere whine and poses. Instead, he called for "refocusing, reform, renewal" and derided the behavior of both parties in "Washington" even more often than he mentioned the word pain or its derivatives, which is what many of his constituents may suffer. (Mr. Cuomo also promised "no sacred cows or sacrificial lambs," but not no more animal metaphors).
Several themes threaded through this week's annual assessments: an unequivocal acknowledgement that fiscal stability is fundamental to any larger agenda, a goal of enlisting the private sector to supplement services that government can no longer afford and proposals that may demonstrate leadership but do not cost much (including Mr. Cuomo's suggested ban on most cigarette vending machines, one measure that the Mayor has already imposed locally). Mr. Dinkins vaguely hinted at only one new initiative: proposed juvenile justice legislation.
Today, Peter F. Vallone, Speaker of the New York City Council, is to deliver his own take on the city; he is expected to recommend a reorganization to make municipal government more efficient. Worse fiscal news follows later this month when the Mayor and the Governor unveil their budgets.
Legislators, public employees, lobbyists and other invited guests who dutifully attended the speeches at City Hall on Tuesday and in the Capitol in Albany yesterday appeared to applaud the loudest when Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Cuomo expressed outrage over crime and at the failure of government -- generally, a government other than their own -- to come to grips with it.
Mr. Cuomo lobbed salvos at Washington (for disingenuously declaring victory in its war on drugs and failing to adopt an energy policy), began his address with an expression of support for United States troops in the Persian Gulf and declared that the Pacific Rim's predominance would be superseded by an "era of the Atlantic" led by "global New York" -- inevitably fueling speculation that his own political ambitions reach beyond Albany, too.
Mr. Dinkins, standing directly under a quotation from Abraham Lincoln, quoted only the poet Langston Hughes in a speech what was otherwise widely described as pedestrian (which doesn't mean any one walked out) and noteworthy for largely missed opportunities: to articulate a vision, and to provide a cohesive framework for some seemingly contradictory decisions.
In a small way, speakers unwittingly provided some insight by what they said without meaning to. Mr. Dinkins predicted that "ours will be a smaller government, but a smaller one" -- then corrected himself and said "a stronger one." Mr. Cuomo said the collective heritage of all New Yorkers contributes to "how great this state was" -- then said "is."
Mr. Cuomo quoted no one, but drew on an address titled "We Cannot Escape History," which he included in "Lincoln on Democracy," a new anthology he edited with an associate, Harold Holzer.
Lincoln is "reassuring to politicians like me," Mr. Cuomo wrote, because "he was himself a big, homely looking politician from a poor family who started off by losing a few elections, yet in the end succeeded brilliantly." By that measure, the Governor is at least five for six so far, but his career has not ended yet.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Weicker's Speech

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s State of the State address to the General Assembly.
 You in this chamber and those who sent me here expect nothing short of total candor in dealing with the problems and opportunities of our state.
So let the message of this day be simple and bold. 
 No more sacrifices postponed. No more decisions ducked. No more lowest-common-denominator solutions.
A deficit has taken control of our lives, coloring all else as it climbs beyond comprehension, sapping our confidence, humbling our visions.
The past is not worth the best of our courage and creativity. That belongs to the future. So let's get this deficit business done, and fast.
 
'Worth Every Moment'
 No broken-field running, ladies and gentlemen. Straight into the line. We take our licks, so that we can restore the caring and quality of life that is Connecticut, unmatched anywhere, hard to define, but a treasure worth every moment of our commitment and spirit during this session.
I can assure you that when I return here in February, we will all be tested for courage and constancy.
The state of the state is rudderless. Well, that's for you and I, if we choose to perform. And we were chosen to perform.
At this moment, Connecticut young men and women are on the line in the Middle East, in the shadow of war. Among them a Marine officer re-elected to this State House of Representatives. It was in tribute to them that those cannon were fired moments ago, and to their families facing lonely vigils.
But in the budget battle ahead, I'm looking to citizen patriots, not partisans. What I seek is your grit and ingenuity, your resolve to accept sacrifices long postponed to gain achievements long denied.
And my door down the hall is as open to you in 1991 as it was to me in 1963 by a great Governor, John Dempsey.
I stand by my commitment to pay as we go. No more downstream debt.
 
To Revive the Economy
 I stand by my commitment to children. In tough times priorities must by set for those who are the most vulnerable. They are children -- our future.
I stand by my commitment to rekindle business in Connecticut, to save and expand jobs, to generate the revenue to turn this state around.
I stand by my commitment to equality of opportunity for all our citizens in all their endeavors. As the bill for good living has come due, so has the bill for constitutional justice denied.
Our pledge is to take responsibility for the problems that confront us and work to see that mistakes are not repeated for the long term.
 
From the Table, Solutions
 There is no time for finger-pointing or scapegoating, barely enough time for solutions so that toughness can withdraw, and compassion and caring once again become our hallmarks.
We will bring everyone to the table -- community leaders, legislators, business executives, labor unions and state employees -- and work out credible solutions that put Connecticut first.
The inference from the election of 1990 is that partisanship and political partnership had best recede even further. People are sick of partisan games and want results, not scorecards.
Lives are at stake -- all our lives.
The people of Connecticut have sent us here to do the right thing, to face up squarely to the facts of a state in fiscal trouble. . . .
Lastly, for those who wonder how solutions can be devised outside of a traditional two-party framework, I refer to the words of Mark Twain, written in Hartford 102 years ago.
 
'The Thing to Watch Over'
 "The country is the real thing, the substantial thing, the eternal thing," said the Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's court. "It is the thing to watch over and care for and be loyal to; institutions are extraneous, they are its mere clothing, and clothing can wear out, become ragged, cease to be comfortable, cease to protect the body from winter, disease and death.
"To be loyal to rags, to shout for rags, to worship rags, to die for rags -- that is a loyalty of unreason, it is pure animal; it belongs to monarchy; was invented by monarchy; let monarchy keep it.
"I was from Connecticut, whose constitution declares 'that all political power is inherent in the people, and all free governments are founded on their authority and instituted for their benefit; and that they have -- at all times -- an undeniable and indefeasible right to alter their form of government in such a manner as they think expedient."
To paraphrase Twain, the state's political clothes are worn out, and it is up to all of us to cut a new suit for these times.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices of Treasury Securities Slide

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Failure to achieve a breakthrough leading to a peaceful resolution of the Persian Gulf crisis threw the credit markets into turmoil yesterday, as prices of Treasury securities tumbled and long-term interest rates rose sharply.
The decline was especially pronounced because early in the day market participants pushed securities prices sharply higher as the talks between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Foreign Minister, dragged on. When the diplomats emerged and Mr. Baker said the Persian Gulf crisis was no nearer resolution than before, a huge selloff ensued. 
 "People got too enthusiastic early in the day because the talks went on for so long," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and money market economist at S.G. Warburg & Company. "But now we are on a very clear course to a hot war on the 15th."
From its early peak, the drop in bond prices amounted to more than 2 points, or more than $20 for each $1,000 face amount of securities.
 
Seven-Year Treasury Notes
 Bidders at an auction of $8.5 billion worth of seven-year Treasury notes were especially hard hit.
The notes went on sale at 1 P.M., when speculation that a peaceful solution in the gulf might be reached was roaring through the market.
To make matters worse, the auction results -- the notes were sold at an average yield of 7.95 percent -- were announced just as Mr. Baker emerged to address the world press.
Dealers said that the first trade in the seven-year notes after Mr. Baker's opening remarks took place at 8.03 percent.
Prices for the notes deteriorated further as the afternoon progressed, and by late in the session the new securities were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.11 percent.
"The market is awash in paper and the world is turned upside down," said David Duerson, manager of trading at the Security Pacific Bank in Los Angeles. "In that sort of environment, you sell."
The yield on the seven-year notes was down from the 8.76 percent average yield at the last seven-year note sale in October.
 
Bonds Bore Brunt of Beating
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, bond prices bore the brunt of the beating after the diplomats in Geneva told the world that no progress toward peace had been made. At the same time, the heightened risk of war encouraged heavy buying of short-term Treasury bills, a classic refuge for investors during times of uncertainty.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 103 7/32, down 26/32, to yield 8.45 percent, up from 8.37 percent late Tuesday. Early in yesterday's session, the price of the benchmark issue was as high as 105 15/32.
At the Chicago Board of Trade, the price of the nearby bond futures contract fell from a high of 95 27/32 just before Mr. Baker held his news conference in Geneva, which began around 2 P.M., Eastern standard time, to a low of 93 20/32 at the close of trading.
With war fears mounting, traders said that a further rise in bond yields was quite possible in the next few days.
"We are now about 40 basis points higher in yield on bonds than we were a couple of weeks ago," one government bond trader said. "Some of that is a war premium. But I would guess there yields would have to go up another 20 basis points or so before you see some interest."
In the Treasury bill market, three-month bills were offered late yesterday at a discount rate of 6.18 percent, down 23 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates plunged 14 basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.26 percent. And one-year bills were offered at 6.25 percent, down six basis points.
Compared with the movements at either extreme of the maturity spectrum, the change in Treasury note prices was relatively modest.
In late trading, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 22/32, down 18/32, to yield 8.24 percent. Meanwhile, the 7 7/8 percent five-year notes were offered at 100 5/32, down 3/8 point, to yield 7.82 percent. And the 7 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 6/32, down 1/32, to yield 7.14 percent.
The Federal Reserve Board, widely seen on Tuesday as having endorsed a further quarter-point decline in the overnight Federal funds rate, to 6.75 percent, did nothing yesterday to dispel that notion, traders said. However, the traders added that since yesterday was the end of a two-week bank reserve reporting period, a time when the funds rate often trades well above or below the Fed's target, it was difficult to be certain.
Yesterday, the funds rate traded in a very wide range, from a high of 7 percent to a low of 4 percent.
Price swings in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities, while not as violent as in the Treasury market, were evident nonetheless.
Corporate bond traders said that prices of most issues, which had been 1/4 point to 3/8 point higher early in the session, ended up 1/2 point lower.
Participants in the municipal bond market said that prices of most widely quoted issues fell by 3/8 point to 1/2 point. Early in the session municipal bond prices had inched about 1/4 point higher.
In the tax-exempt market, the City of San Francisco offered $120 million of bonds at competitive bid.
A bid from a group led by Bank of America won the issue, which consists of serial bonds maturing from 1991 to 2010. The bonds carry a maximum yield of 6.80 percent in 2010.
The securities are rated AA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Prescribes Austerity, Not Activism

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who has often defined his activist vision of government with grand and expensive initiatives, said today that New York's deteriorating financial condition demands a new austerity that must be evenly spread.
Delivering his ninth State of the State address, and the first of his third term, Mr. Cuomo said the state's recessionary economy must be reinvigorated with "new thinking instead of new spending." 
 In past years, Mr. Cuomo has used the State of the State speech, which opens the legislative session, to unveil ambitious new programs that have become hallmarks of his administration -- environmental bond acts, increases in the welfare grant, anti-drug programs and initiatives on child welfare.
 
'Year for Raw Truth'
 In today's 62-minute speech, and the 121-page policy blueprint he released with it, Mr. Cuomo was careful to make few budgetary commitments that he might be unable to keep.
Although the Governor and the Legislature closed a $1 billion budget gap only last month, state fiscal analysts now believe the gap in this year's $29 billion budget could grow by an additional $500 million by the end of the fiscal year on March 31. They speculate that the state could face a budget gap in the next fiscal year of up to $4 billion.
"This is a wonderful year for raw truth," Mr. Cuomo said with a wry smile. "We don't have any money. We don't have any other options. Let's shock everybody. Let's tell everybody the whole truth."
Many of the proposals the Governor highlighted, such as creating a privately financed loan fund for small business expansion, changing the state's fiscal year, and requiring private employers to offer family-leave benefits, were measures that would require legislation but not dollars.
When he made proposals that would require new money, like the creation of dedicated funds for transportation and environmental projects, Mr. Cuomo declined to suggest how they might be financed.
Other initiatives, like a major expansion of child-care services, would be paid for largely with Federal funds. Mr. Cuomo stated flatly that the money was not available to achieve goals like lengthening the school year or establishing universal health insurance. But he pledged to keep debate alive on those issues through study commissions and public hearings.
To a certain extent, Cuomo aides said, the Governor was handicapped by an ever-deepening hole in state revenues, making it politically dangerous for him to outline his budget plans too precisely.
Mr. Cuomo must propose his executive budget, and his plans for taxing and spending, by Feb. 1. He made few specific vows regarding the budget today, other than to promise that "there will be no sacred cows, and there will be no sacrificial lambs."
 
Under Close Scrutiny
 The 58-year-old Governor, who is mentioned regularly as a potential Democratic Presidential candidate, has said it makes no sense for him even to consider a national race until this year's fiscal crisis is resolved. Political analysts from coast to coast will be watching the budget process to judge whether Mr. Cuomo can manage his most difficult financial challenge without sacrificing his political ideals.
Mr. Cuomo conceded in today's speech that the state's fiscal condition poses a serious threat to his philosophy of government.
"Preserving this state as a place that provides opportunity to the able and protection to the defenseless -- that must be our goal now," he said, speaking to a joint session of the Legislature gathered in the Assembly's chamber.
"It will not be easy. The immediate goal is to live within our means, closing the gap between what we would have proposed to spend and our diminished resources. It is essential that we do this, because if we do not maintain fiscal integrity by taking this bitter medicine, then we lose the capacity to pursue the mission."
 
Miller Concerned
 The majority leader of the state Senate, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, said he was encouraged by the talk of fiscal discipline. But Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, Democrat of Brooklyn, said he was concerned that the state's social safety net would not be maintained.
"I really don't see anything blueprinted, anything that says how you can bring that budget down $3 billion or $4 billion and still preserve the infrastructure," he said.
Advocates for the poor and infirm were quick to criticize Mr. Cuomo for failing to propose initiatives that would protect society's weakest members from the ravages of recession.
Russell Sykes, a policy analyst with the State Communities Aid Association, a social-service lobbying group, said he was disappointed that the Governor had not proposed an increase in the welfare grant, since a study by the association concluded that the grant's purchasing power had declined by 37 percent in the last two decades.
Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, Democrat of Manhattan, said the Governor's promise not to cut funding for AIDS programs was inadequate given that nearly 7,000 new cases were diagnosed in New York State last year. "What the AIDS program needs to stay in place is rapid growth," said Mr. Gottfried, the chairman of the Health Committee.
 
Anti-Tobacco Proposal
 In other health and welfare proposals, Mr. Cuomo said he would submit legislation requiring companies to allow workers to take an unpaid leave from their jobs to care for a newborn child or a seriously ill relative without risking the loss of their job.
He proposed a comprehensive adolescent anti-tobacco bill that would prohibit the free distribution of tobacco products, ban the sale of cigarettes in vending machines, prohibit the use of tobacco on school grounds and ban tobacco advertising in many public places.
Mr. Cuomo promised to expand the state's residential and outpatient drug-treatment capacity by 13,500 spots, although many of those positions have been paid for in previous budgets. He also said he would submit a bill that would give judges more leeway in sentencing nonviolent drug offenders to alternative correctional programs.
As expected, the Governor suggested moving the start of the state fiscal year from April 1 to July 1, a change he said would enable more accurate budget forecasting. The State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, said the state's bookkeeping system could not be adjusted quickly enough to make the move this year.
 
Criticizing Washington
 In response to last year's defeat of a $1.975 billion environmental bond act, Mr. Cuomo today proposed a limited "pay-as-you-go" trust fund for environmental projects. He did not specify how it would be financed, but said the proceeds would be dedicated to solid-waste management, water treatment, recycling and parks development. He cautioned that there would be no money in the near future for land acquisition.
Mr. Cuomo used the speech to repeat his familiar refrain that New York's economic problems were born in Washington. He spoke emotionally about what he sees as an abdication of Federal responsibility in attacking the urban plagues of drugs, homelessness, crime and AIDS.
"The cumulative weight of this decade-long shift of the burden," he said, "combined with shrinking revenues as a result of the national recession, is crushing many states, including New York."

HEADLINE: BUDGET VS. VISIONS;
Challenge for Cuomo Is Keeping Alive His Programs in Fiscally Bleak Period

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Presenting his State of the State address today, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo banged up against the toughest challenge of his administration: maintaining the liberal agenda he has advocated in good times through a period that promises to be bleak.
 It is a challenge so stark that Mr. Cuomo had little choice but to embrace it openly. Today he said, "The immediate goal is to live within our means, closing the gap between what we would have proposed to spend and our diminished resources." 
 But the "ultimate challenge," he said, "is, while balancing the budget, to keep alive in New York the vision of America."
Just how Mr. Cuomo proposes to meet these twin challenges, balancing the budget and keeping alive "the vision of America," will not be fully known until he proposes his budget this month. But in his address Mr. Cuomo offered important clues about his intentions.
The Governor does not, for example, intend to initiate any new social programs that require state money. The few new programs that he mentioned today -- among them a proposal to introduce parental leave in New York State -- do not involve the commitment of any additional state dollars. Instead, the Governor said, "in everything we do we must emphasize refocusing, reform, renewal."
 
'In Our Hands'
 At the same time, the Governor said he was anxious to avoid retreating from those commitments that he had already made. Today he pledged not to cut funds for AIDS treatment or to abandon the obligation to children that he took on when he declared the Decade of the Child in 1988.
"The future of our children is in our hands," he said. "We will not abandon our commitment to the Decade of the Child."
Keeping a vision alive in hard times is an intangible goal, and whether Mr. Cuomo succeeds at it is a judgment that cannot be made on the basis of conventional political measurements: money spent, miles paved, jobs created. But as soon as the Governor's hourlong address was over, many politicians and advocacy groups took issue with his contention that a progressive agenda could be sustained without additional resources.
"We were expecting the worst, and this doesn't provide us with much to think to the contrary," said Russell Sykes, a policy analyst for the State Communities Aid Association, a lobbying group. "I don't know how you can preserve the mission without taking at least some discrete programs and expanding them. Do you preserve it verbally but not in practice?"
At a time the recession is pushing many of the state's poorer residents further and further into poverty, Mr. Sykes said, simply maintaining existing programs represents a step backward. "I'm afraid that the three R's -- refocusing, reform and renewal -- will become retrenchment, retreat and repeal," he said.
The State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, offered mild praise, saying the speech "sounded the right tone" for the difficult months ahead. But Mr. Marino seemed only to be weakening the Governor's case when he said Mr. Cuomo "sounded an awful lot like a conservative Republican."
In his remarks today, Mr. Cuomo suggested the terms under which he would like to be judged as he confronts the toughest challenge of his tenure: did he manage to preserve the state's existing social programs?
 
Pressures to Expand
 "We cannot avoid all the pain," Mr. Cuomo said. "But we can use this ordeal to lead us to a new era of progress if we deal with our huge fiscal imbalance without dismantling what we've already built."
But aides to Mr. Cuomo insist that even that goal -- avoiding "dismantling what we've already built" -- will be wrenchingly difficult to meet. Recent tax-collection data suggest that New York's fiscal problems are even worse than was expected when experts predicted that the state would start the next fiscal year, which begins on April 1, with a budget gap of $4 billion.
"The Governor is clearly going to protect the mission and the investments we've made," the counselor to the Governor, Drew Zambelli, said. "But it's unrealistic to say that social programs will not see any cuts."
Assembly Speaker Mel Miller, Democrat of Brooklyn, has often attacked the Governor for not living up in his programs to the liberal thrust of his oratory. But this year Mr. Miller, too, seems to believe that the best that can be hoped for is preserving whatever gains have been made in the past.
"I thought," Mr. Miller said, "it was going to be a speech that basically said: 'We're going to have to do the things we do best even better. We're going to have to make less go further.'
"And I think that was the emphasis of the Governor's speech today, and I don't think you can debate that. The truth is the resources are just not going to be there."

HEADLINE: MARKETS' DAY OF WIDE SWINGS;
Oil Prices Fluctuate Wildly, Then Settle Just 9 Higher

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Oil prices took a wild ride yesterday but came to rest just about where they started. When Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d announced his disappointing news in Geneva just before 2 P.M., the price jumped nearly 30 percent in five minutes, rushing from $24 a barrel to $31.
It was the widest price swing within one day's trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange since trading in crude oil began in March 1983. 
 Worldwide, the price bounced throughout the day. Early in the morning, before futures trading opened in New York at 9:45, prices in this country and in London were slightly higher because of fears that war was likely. But then the meeting between Mr. Baker and Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, lasted longer than the market had expected, with reports of progress. Suddenly traders were afraid of holding oil or contracts for oil that would lose value because of peace.
Then came word, which proved incorrect, that the two men would hold a joint news conference, and the market went lower, expecting an agreement. But when Mr. Baker said the talks had been inconclusive, "the market exploded," said Richard D. Donovan, senior vice president at Lehman Brothers. Traders became convinced that the oil or contracts they had sold in the morning would be worth much more later on because of war, and they all turned to buy.
"It's staggering," said Mr. Donovan, who pointed out that oil is the world's biggest commodity. Describing what a move that size would mean on other markets, he said, "Can you imagine the Dow Jones going up 750 points in five minutes? Or gold going up $100?"
Theodore R. Eck, chief economist at Amoco, called the jump "phenomenal."
"It just tells us there's extreme uncertainty and the folly of trying to forecast prices," he said.
Despite the size of the trading range, $7.65, the day ended with crude for February delivery up only 9 cents, at $27.26 a barrel. The surge had been preceded by a huge selloff, and the market, which frequently overshoots its mark, fell back after reaching its peak.
The record change in closing price from one day's session to the next is $5.41, set last Oct. 22. Trading was heavy yesterday, at 126,000 contracts, but short of the record of 185,000 set last Aug. 7.
 
Petroleum Products Advance
 Heating oil for delivery next month closed at 77.09 a gallon, up 2.79 cents, and unleaded gasoline closed at 73.31 cents, up 3.13 cents.
For some traders, however, the volatility yesterday was evidence that in a war, the market could test the price-movement limit recently set in place by the exchange -- a move of $15 a barrel in one day.
"If the market can move $7 in five minutes on a just a press conference, you can well imagine that it could do more in a war," said Nauman Barakat, a vice president at Merrill Lynch. "It's certainly possible that the $15 limit could be reached."
Another analyst, Peter C. Beutel, said, "The thing that has made this market so volatile is the black-and-white nature of the negotiations." Mr. Beutel, who is with the Pegasus Econometric Group, said, "There was no place to be in a middle ground."
But other market-watchers said there was meaning to be gleaned from the fact that the swing was not even larger. At the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington-based consulting group, J. Robinson West, the president, said, "Although we may be closer to war, timewise and in terms of options, the price was $10 lower than the peak reached earlier."
The reason, he said, was that the trading yesterday "was not an international economic panic, just a traders' panic." When prices peaked above $40 a barrel in October, he said, "all eyes realized that there was a quantum change in trading oil, the fundamental commodity of international trade." This time, he said, it was "traders watching short-term spikes."
Vahan Zanoyan, an analyst at the same company, said that if peace actually prevailed, prices would decline below yesterday's $24, and if war came, they would rise above $31.
This is not the first instance of a huge increase in the price of oil, but the market yesterday was substantially different from the last two crises -- during the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74 and following the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979. This price revolution is televised, on thousands of monitor screens around the world, making the volatility far more obvious and inviting participants -- oil producers, oil users and speculators -- to join in, perhaps driving the changes even further.
But the market is working well, said Nachama Jacobovitz, a spokeswoman for the exchange. No matter what the price at any moment, she said, "people were able to lock in the prices they wanted to."

HEADLINE: Markets in U.S. Shift Abruptly On Gulf Report

 BODY:
Financial markets gyrated wildly yesterday as traders reacted first with hope, then with alarm, to the American-Iraqi talks on the Middle East. But some markets, notably gold and oil, turned again and ended little changed.
Stock and bond prices rose in early trading, while oil and the dollar declined, after a White House spokesman said the talks were "substantive." 
 But prices reversed just before 2 P.M., when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d began a news conference.
"Baker came out and said 'regrettably,' and no one had to hear anything else," said Liliana Nealon, a foreign exchange trader in New York with the Union Bank of Switzerland.
The Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 45 points at its peak, closed down 39.11, at 2,470.30.
In the oil pits of the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for February delivery of crude oil fell to $23.35 and then soared to $31, the largest such swing ever in oil trading. But prices reversed again as Mr. Baker said President Bush had not decided to go to war; they ended at $27.26, only 9 cents above Tuesday's level.
"It is a world of absolute, massive uncertainty," said Theodore R. Eck, chief economist of the Amoco Corporation. "Nobody knows anything about a war. It's like a football game; the only thing the coach ever knows is what he's going to call for the first play."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Sony's Columbia Unit Planning Theme Park

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Columbia Pictures Entertainment, the Hollywood studio owned by the Sony Corporation, plans to enter the theme park business and may build one or more attractions in the United States or abroad.
Columbia said it had received permission from Sony to move ahead with plans for a Sonyland theme park, but that details on the size, scope and location of any proposed project would not be released until later this year. 
 One option it is considering is building an attraction in Southern California to compete against Disneyland and the Universal Studios Tour in Hollywood.
 
'All Kinds of Options'
 "We're looking at all kinds of options," a spokeswoman for Columbia Pictures said. "There really are no details."
The spokeswoman said the Columbia Pictures executive in charge of the project, Paul Schaeffer, was traveling and not available for comment.
Theme parks are crucial to the business of several of Columbia's competitors in entertainment, including the Walt Disney Company and MCA Inc., which is being acquired by the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company. The parks are highly lucrative and considered valuable accompaniments to the film and television businesses of the two large entertainment companies.
The parks, movies, television shows and books are used to promote each other and build each other's businesses. For example, at Disney's parks, many of the rides are based on Disney characters. The parks also sell merchandise based on the characters, films and books.
 
Appeal Among Children
 To increase its appeal among children, the Six Flags Corporation, an amusement park company in which Time Warner Inc. owns a 19.5 percent stake, licenses the "Looney Tunes" cartoon characters from Warner Brothers for use in its seven parks.
For attractions in its theme parks, Sony's options include relying on its library of Columbia and Tri-Star films and television shows, its Sony Music subsidiary, formerly CBS Records, and its huge Sony consumer electronics business.
It could also base a ride or attraction on some of Sony's high-tech products like high-definition television. Another potential basis for an attraction is a film under development for Columbia's Tri-Star studio by Steven Spielberg based on "Peter Pan." The movie, "Hook," will star Robin Williams as a descendant of Peter Pan.
One question for Columbia is whether it will acquire rights to cartoon characters for its attractions. In an effort to build its stable of characters, Disney last year negotiated to acquire Henson Associates, which owns the Muppets, although the deal fell apart late last year.
 
Long-Term Outlook Strong
 While the current market in Southern California for attractions is slow, Joseph R. Schillaci, president of Six Flags' Magic Mountain amusement park in Valencia, Calif., said he believed the long-term outlook remained strong, despite the current recession.
"There is certainly room for more, as Florida has proved where there are several theme parks," he said. "One of the primary reasons for visitors coming to Southern California is to see the parks. One more park is not going to make much difference and it may just add to the appeal of Southern California as a destination."
Following that logic, both Disney and MCA plan to expand their Southern California parks.
MCA is spending $100 million in the next year to expand the Universal Studio Hollywood tourist attraction. And Disney has said it is considering expanding Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., or building a new park in Long Beach, Calif.

HEADLINE: Regulators Are Glum On Outlook

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The nation's senior banking regulators said today that more large failures like the Bank of New England would occur if the economy did not turn around by the middle of the year.
Painting a glum portrait of the banking industry, both L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Robert L. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, told Congress that there was strong evidence that the economy's problems, particularly in New England, had only begun. 
 "Almost everything we're seeing in unscientific samples shows we're not seeing any improvement and we might see some further decline," Mr. Seidman told the Senate Banking Committee. "I am not prepared to say that the economy has bottomed out."
 
What Kind of Recession
 Mr. Seidman said there would be more large failures if the recession was more than "short and shallow." Mr. Seidman defined such a recession as one in which the gross national product does not decline by more than 2 percent over two quarters and the economy begins to turn around within two quarters, in this case by midyear.
When he announced that the Bank of New England was being seized by the Government on Sunday, Mr. Seidman said he did not anticipate other large failures soon. His remarks today did not directly contradict that position because many economists expect a mild economic decline.
As a result of the threat of large failures, Mr. Seidman said officials and industry representatives had begun exploring ways for the Government to intervene before institutions face the brink of collapse, but he did not describe any specific measures.
The fund that protects bank deposits is at its lowest level since its creation during the Depression, and is expected to lose $5 billion this year from failures, leaving it with $4 billion by the end of 1991.
Regulators have based their estimates of the losses to the Federal fund that insures bank deposits on a forecast of a mild recession.
Mr. Seidman said he still did not expect a Government bailout of the fund, which is financed by a levy on the industry, but he appeared to be considerably less optimistic than he was late last year.
"It's not beyond the realm of possibility that taxpayer money will be needed," he said.
"Clearly the banking industry is under stress," he said. "It is not, however, in a situation like the Great Depression or anything like that magnitude."
The Bush Administration is preparing to present soon to Congress a package of proposals to overhaul the nation's banking system and the program that insures deposits. Despite the consensus on Capitol Hill that the support given Bank of New England would slow the drive to limit deposit insurance, which currently covers all accounts up to $100,000, Administration officials are preparing to reducecoverage so that it does not fully protect larger institutions, like pension funds, that break down their deposits into $100,000 increments so that they can be fully insured.
 
Treasury Proposals
 Treasury officials also said today that they planned to go forward with one of two proposals to limit the amount of coverage sharply for individuals. While technically the coverage of each account is limited to $100,000, the current system enables families and others to obtain protection of significantly more than that by putting the funds in different names and joint accounts.
One proposal is to limit the total coverage for each depositor to $100,000 systemwide. The other would limit the number of $100,000 accounts protected to three for a depositor.
Officials concede that either measure would be difficult to achieve, but would probably rely on a system that uses the depositor's Social Security number.
At a morning hearing before the Senate committee and an afternoon session before the House Banking Committee, Mr. Seidman and Mr. Clarke came under heavy questioning about the way the Government handled the collapse of the Bank of New England.
 
Questions of Fairness
 Lawmakers criticized the decision to protect all depositors, including the estimated $2 billion in accounts of larger than $100,000, and $55 million in foreign branches that do not contribute to the bank insurance fund. They also raised questions about the fairness of protecting all accounts at larger banks, like Bank of New England, but not smaller ones, like Freedom National Bank, the minority-owned institution in Harlem that was seized by the Government in November.
Mr. Seidman conceded that the current system was fundamentally unfair, but said he could do little without changes in the law. He said Freedom had failed to meet current standards, which require that its existence was essential to the community it served, and that it was cheaper to close it than to save all of its depositors. In the case of the Bank of New England, he said, a failure to protect all deposits would have further destabilized the area's economy.
Mr. Clarke said the losses from the Bank of New England to the insurance fund "may well have been reduced" because the Government waited more than a year after the bank's difficulties began to appear to declare the institution insolvent. He said the decision to approve a new management team at the bank early last year had made it possible for the bank to sell many of its assets and reduce its overhead more efficiently than the Government might have done.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Congress Nears War Debate, as Bush Side Gains

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Congress stepped to the brink today of debating war in the Persian Gulf, with the House's agenda clearer than the Senate's. The outcome in both chambers is dependent on how many Democrats join nearly solid Republican ranks in support of resolutions backing President Bush's use of force in accordance with United Nations resolutions.
Mr. Bush's chances of prevailing were increased, according to Representative Lee H. Hamilton, Democrat of Indiana and chairman of the House foreign affairs subcommittee on the Middle East, by the apparent failure today of the Geneva meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq. That "raises the temperature, makes war more likely, and probably helps the President get votes for his resolution," he said. 
 Earlier in the House, Speaker Thomas S. Foley squelched an effort by Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committee to join with Republicans and endorse a resolution backing the use of force, as a majority appeared ready to do. At his insistence, the committee planned to report out that resolution, probably Thursday, along with one calling for further reliance on sanctions and diplomacy, and a less controversial statement reasserting the exclusivity of Congressional power to declare war.
The House Rules Committee will meet early Thursday afternoon to set procedures for the debate on those three declarations. The debate is expected to begin later in the day and conclude with voting on Saturday.
 
Senate Discussions Continue
 In the Senate, the majority leader, George J. Mitchell, said debate could start as early as Thursday morning. He said discussions about language of various possible resolutions was continuing, and said he personally favored trying sanctions and diplomacy longer.
But Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, complained: "We don't have any idea what the Democrats intend to do. We don't have any idea what they want to vote on."
Then, warming to partisanship, he added, "The Republican strategy is to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. Some of the Democrats' strategy appears to be to get Bush out of the White House."
The partisan division was actually clearer in the House than in the unsettled Senate. A survey taken Tuesday and today by The New York Times and CBS News, in which Congressional press secretaries were asked where their bosses stood, found that 142 House Democrats preferred to let economic sanctions have more time to damage Iraq, while only 32 of them wanted to use force promptly if Iraq was not out of Kuwait by Jan. 15.
 
Independent Favors Waiting
 Among House Republicans, 74 said they favored force now, while 11 wanted to try the sanctions longer. The House's one independent, Representative Bernard Sanders of Vermont, also favored waiting.
That left 93 Democrats and 82 Republicans not answering the survey, and the backgrounds of those who did not respond suggested, tentatively, that the President's position would prevail narrowly, as Mr. Foley has predicted.
Some Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committee, insisting that their names not be used, complained about Mr. Foley's interference. They said a majority of the committee, led by its chairman, Representative Dante B. Fascell of Florida, wanted to agree to President Bush's request that Congress support the use of force if Iraq did not withdraw from Kuwait by the United Nations deadline of Tuesday.
 
Foley's Reasons Given
 But an aide to the Speaker argued that Mr. Foley's purpose was only to make sure that the committee did not narrow the options that would come before the House. He also said that while the committee had been constituted early, so that it could hold hearings on the gulf situation, it was not yet filled with Democrats chosen this month, from the new Congress.
Along with the resolution sought by Mr. Bush, Democratic aides said, the House will also consider a resolution assembled by Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, and Mr. Hamilton. That resolution will insist that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait but say that for the time being force should not be used to attack Iraq while diplomacy and economic sanctions are given more time. It also maintains that Mr. Bush should return to Congress with another request to use force if he wants to employ it later.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Cheney Says He Will Seek Longer Term for Reservists

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The Defense Department plans to ask the White House for emergency authority to keep reservists in the military for as long as two years, Pentagon officials said today.
The officials said they needed the expanded authority primarily because the six-month tour of reservists already called up for support roles in the Persian Gulf and the United States would begin to expire in February, depriving the military of critical specialists like doctors, water purifiers and chemical decontamination experts. 
 The statute that allows the Pentagon to seek expansion of its authority to keep reservists also contains a provision that would give it authority to summon up to one million reservists.
 
No Big Effort Planned
 Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters today that the Pentagon does not plan such a large call-up.
The Bush Administration has the authority to call up to 200,000 reservists at any one time. About 150,000 reservists have been called up for support and combat roles. Under the current authority, reservists summoned for support roles can only be called up for six months. Those called up for combat roles can have their tours extended to a year under special authority granted last year by the Congress.
Mr. Cheney told reporters at a White House news conference today that a formal Pentagon request to the President for expanded reserve call-up authority was "in the works" and was needed to maintain reservists with critical skills.
"We have no intention of calling one million reservists," Mr. Cheney said. "But that's the provision that's available for me to be able to extend those people in critical skills, whose services are now being utilized, and whom we would like to keep for this period of time so we don't have to release them immediately back to reserve status."
But a Pentagon official said the Defense Department could use its expanded authority to call up more than the 200,000 reservists allowed if war broke out. Reservists' extended terms would most likely be measured in months, since the Pentagon has said that any war with Iraq would take place soon and be relatively brief.
 
Backing Appears Certain
 Though not formally transmitted to the White House, President Bush's acceptance of the Pentagon recommendation appears to be assured. Mr. Cheney, who carefully weighs his public pronouncements, would not discuss his recommendation in a news conference if he had doubts about its political acceptability at the White House.
Besides enabling the Pentagon to keep reservists in critical skills, some specialists on military manpower issues said the expansion of the Pentagon's call-up authority had other advantages for the Defense Department.
Martin Binkin, a specialist on military manpower issues at the Brookings Institution here, said the expanded authority the Pentagon was seeking would also enable the Defense Department to summon members of the Individual Ready Reserve, who have needed skills. The reserve is made up of people who leave the military with a reserve obligation but do not belong to units or train regularily. They cannot be summoned to duty under the Pentagon's existing authority.
Mr. Binkin said expanding the Pentagon's call-up authority would also send another signal to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that the United States was ready to go to war to evict Iraqi troops from Kuwait.
"It will deepen the Congressional debate," Mr. Binkin said. "Everyone has got reservists as constituents. It is a good step to test public support for this operation."
The new Pentagon request is the latest in a series of moves to support the deployment of more than 400,000 troops to the Persian Gulf.
 
Changes for Active Personnel
 The Defense Department has suspended the retirements, transfers and tour expirations of all active-duty peronnel in the gulf with critical skills. In November, the Army extended the order to include all Army personnel, regardless of where they were serving.
The service says that it took the step to avoid depleting its ranks around the world during the buildup in the gulf and to insure that it will have needed replacements should war erupt.
The Marine Corps is offering some former Marines, who would not have ordinarily been allowed to re-enlist, a chance to do so. The program, which begun in mid-December, is intended to attract Marines with critical skills.
Pentagon officials have been signaling that they might need expanded call-up authority, either by asking the President for more emergency authority or by asking the Congress for added power to summon reserves.
The Bush Administration has repeatedly stressed that it has no intention of resorting to a draft.
Keeping reservists for longer than six months will extend the financial hardships that many are suffering.
Military pay is generally considerably lower than pay in the civilian economy. While some private companies who temporarily lose employees to the reserves make up the difference in pay, many do not.
 
Jobs Are Guaranteed
 By Federal law, reservists are guaranteed that they will have a job with their employer upon their return that is of the same pay level and stature.
Reserves were first called up in August, after President Bush issued an order on Aug. 22 authorizing the Defense Department to summon as many as 200,000 reservists to duty.
Mr. Cheney, in turn, gave the military services specific authorization to call up to 188,000 reserves. So far, 151,700 have been summoned to duty. About half have been sent to the Persian Gulf, while others have filled in for troops sent there.
Of the reservists called to duty, 108,531 are in the Army, 18,957 are in the Marines, 13,656 are in the Air Force, 9,939 are in the Navy, and 628 are in the Coast Guard.

HEADLINE: Grace Moving 400 Employees

 BODY:
W. R. Grace & Company, whose ties to New York City go back a century, said yesterday that it would move most of its staff, about 400 employees, from Manhattan to Boca Raton, Fla.
The company said, however, that it would keep its headquarters in the Grace Building, a skyscraper at 1114 Avenue of the Americas at 43d Street. Only 40 to 50 employees will be left there.
A spokesman said the move, expected at the end of the summer, was for economic reasons.
Mayor David N. Dinkins said Grace had made up its mind without consulting the city.
William R. Grace, grandfather of the chemical company's current chairman, J. Peter Grace, was Mayor of New York in 1891-92.
The move, first reported on Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal, will involve about 400 of the fewer than 500 Grace staff members in the New York headquarters, which now occupies 10 floors of the 50-story building. Grace is its main tenant but not its owner.

HEADLINE: Debt Warning On Car Makers

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's Corporation said today that it had put the Big Three auto makers on notice that their corporate debt ratings could be lowered because of a worsening economic picture and specific problems at each company.
Standard & Poor's placed the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation on its "credit watch" list.
Any subsequent lowering of the debt ratings would make it more difficult and more expensive for the companies to borrow money.

HEADLINE: Weicker, an Independent, Is Sworn In, Asking Bipartisan Help

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Lowell Palmer Weicker Jr., who broke the rules of Connecticut politics last year with his successful third-party run for governor, took the oath of office today as the state's first independent chief executive in more than a century.
An hour later, in his first State of the State address before the Democratically controlled legislature, the General Assembly, Mr. Weicker urged legislators to discard party politics, just as he had, in the interest of solving the state's problems. 
 But he provided almost no specifics about what he wanted them to achieve, and his references to the large and growing gap in the state budget were vague enough that lawmakers in each party seemed to think Mr. Weicker had taken their point of view rather than their rivals'.
He did not mention, for instance, the possibility of laying off state employees or closing down state institutions to save money. He did not name any specific taxes, either ones that are on the books and that could be increased or ones that might be proposed, like an income tax. And although he once again ruled out borrowing money through the sale of bonds, he suggested no other revenue-raising alternatives.
 
'Looking to Citizen Patriots'
 "In the budget battle ahead, I'm looking to citizen patriots, not partisans," Mr. Weicker told the legislators. "What I seek is your grit and ingenuity, your resolve to accept sacrifices long postponed to gain achievements long denied."
For both Mr. Weicker and the legislative leaders he must work with, it was a day of setting tones and issuing general declarations: that the state's budget problems are serious but can be resolved, that an independent governor can indeed work with a two-party legislature, and that communication is essential between all parties.
For Mr. Weicker, who is 59 years old, the processions and ceremonies were a sort of personal vindication. A Republican United States Senator for 18 years, he lost his seat in 1988 in a bitterly fought race against Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Democrat.
Today, Mr. Weicker was sworn back onto the public stage as Governor. Retired Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., a friend of the Weicker family, administeredthe oath in a frigid and icy outdoor ceremony on the steps of the Capitol. Mr. Weicker stood hatless in the 26-degree chill and blowing sleet as a 19-gun salute thundered across the Capitol grounds and a band played "Hail to the Chief." He became the 81st governor of Connecticut and its first independent one since Alexander H. Holley, who served from 1857 to 1858.
The General Assembly also began its fivemonth 1991 session with the swearing-in today of its 187 members. In his speech to them, Mr. Weicker said the state's looming revenue shortfall had "taken control of our lives, coloring all else as it climbs beyond comprehension, sapping our confidence and humbling our visions."
The shortfall is projected to reach $670 million in the year that ends on June 30. If current spending is maintained, it will growto $1.5 billion in the following year in a budget of slightly more than $7 billion. State tax officials have said that falling tax collections from corporations and declining sales-tax revenues are the direct cause of the budget gap, and that a recession in real-estate, banking, construction and other industries underlies it. Some lawmakers who believe the state's first priority must be to stimulate the economy -- and thereby get tax revenues flowing again -- said they were encouraged by Mr. Weicker's promise to "rekindle business" and "save and expand jobs."
Those who feel the budget crisis is an opportunity to overhaul the tax system said they were heartened when Mr. Weicker said that in February, when he proposes his budget, "we will all be tested for courage and constancy."
"I think he's going to come in with an income tax," said the Deputy House Speaker, Dean P. Markham, a Democrat from East Hampton. "He seemed to talk about taking care of all Connecticut's needs immediately -- we're not going to put them off for the future, we're going to address the problems we have now -- and that's admirable."
 
Looking for Cues on Income Tax
 Connecticut is one of 10 states that do not tax regular income, and lawmakers in both parties have watched Mr. Weicker for cues as to whether his administration will break the long political taboo against the tax.
Even what was not said was carefully noted. In a short speech after his swearing-in, for instance, Mr. Weicker told shivering friends and supporters gathered on the Capitol steps that he meant to "be tough in establishing a quality of life second to none, paid for by all."
But when Mr. Weicker spoke later to lawmakers, the "paid for by all" phrase was not included.
Instead, Mr. Weicker spoke in bruising football terminology that some lawmakers said pointed toward the same thing anyway -- making all people pay for the state's problems. At the least, it indicated to lawmakers that a lot of pain should be anticipated.
"No broken-field running, ladies and gentlemen," Mr. Weicker said. "Straight into the line. We take our licks so that we can restore the caring and quality of life that is Connecticut."
Some Republican legislators said they were particularly concerned that Mr. Weicker, who had a liberal voting record in Congress on social issues, had not given sufficient emphasis to spending cuts as a way to cut the deficit. But with so few specifics in the speech, even the critics had to base their opinions on what they thought Mr. Weicker should have said rather than on what he did say.
"He wasn't very detailed about what the sacrifices would be, and I wished he had been," said Representative Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., a Republican from Bristol and the House minority leader. "I think he certainly could have laid down the law little bit more, been perhaps a bit sterner. This is the this most difficult group to convince that sacrifice is neccessary."

HEADLINE: Old Reliables Shine At Wares Show

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Marketing experts say rule No. 1 in a recession is not to be overly daring. Stick to familiar, time-honored designs. Use natural materials when possible. And make sure to meet genuine needs rather than engage in gimmickry.
So as 1,800 housewares manufacturers, thousands of retailers and others concerned about the economy's slowdown gathered here this week for the semiannual convention of the National Housewares Manufacturers Association, "take no chances" was the watchword. 
 True, this winter's show, which ran from Sunday through today at the McCormick Place Exposition Center, featured the usual array of newfangled contraptions. The Welbilt Corporation displayed a product called the Hot Diggity Dogger that cooked frankfurters and buns at the same time in the same appliance; the Peterboro Basket Company offered an insulated picnic basket with a lid that can be sat on, and Rhythm USA offered a singing chicken alarm clock.
But there was row after row of products that had not changed at all: everything from nonstick cookware to water purifiers.
Many manufacturers chose to play it safe, updating already successful products or reintroducing products that had once been successful but had been withdrawn years ago. All of the products will be available in stores or catalogues in coming weeks.
About 13 years ago, Farberware Inc. of the Bronx stopped producing a scaled-down version of its famed tabletop broiler and rotisserie. Farberware found that the smaller unit was unsuitable for larger families that ate big chickens, turkeys and steaks. And many single people complained that it took up too much space in tiny kitchens.
 With the increase in one- and two-person households, Farberware has decided to reintroduce the mini-broiler without a rotisserie. The new Smokeless Indoor Grill, priced at $49.95, is collapsible; it can be stored in a space about 8 inches wide, 13 inches long and 4 inches high.
The base, which is made of durable heat-resistant plastic instead of steel, is hinged so that it can be broken down and placed inside the broiler along with the grill rack, drip pan and heating element.
"We can't keep cluttering the counter," said Irwin J. Gerber, a Farberware sales director.
Although Farberware officials said the folding broiler is more convenient, they noted that it still retains features of the old broiler that consumers seemed to like most, including an adjustable grill and an almost-smokeless cooking system. Hot drippings are vaporized by the 2,000-degree heating element, and surrounding air keeps the broiler body at a temperature so low that any fat hitting it does not turn to smoke.
 Health o Meter Inc. of Bridgeview, Ill., has also revamped an old product. Almost 70 years ago the company introduced a floor scale that became an industry standard. Made of heavy-gauge steel with big black numbers on the dial and with oversized, slip-resistant mats on the base, the scale was a hit because of its durability, ease of use and accuracy.
Now the decades-old design has been updated. Health o Meter's new Big Foot Electronic scale is still rugged and oversized; the unit weighs more than 10 pounds and can accommodate a man with a size-15 shoe. What is different is the system inside the scale for measuring weight, which is almost entirely electronic. Moreover, the digital display produces two-inch-high numbers -- the largest readout in the industry, according to Health o Meter officials.
"It was such a strong design that we wanted to retain it but we needed to offer some variations," said Michael Brezette, a company vice president.
Company officials said the new floor model should remain as accurate as most doctors' balance scales for many years, because it has virtually no mechanical parts like springs or balances that can reduce its accuracy. To show it means business, Health o Meter offers a five-year warranty with the Big Foot electronic scale and says it will fix the $80 scale after the warranty period for just what it costs the company to repair it.
Knowing that there are few things more disappointing at breakfast than cold toast, Krups has come up with a Toastronic Signal toaster that has a warming feature. The toast does not pop up when the feature is on but is kept warm by residual heat inside the machine. Krups officials said the residual heat can last up to three minutes -- long enough, for example, to complete a telephone call before sitting down to breakfast.
The Toastronic Signal, a wide-mouthed, long-slot toaster that can handle two slices of bread, bagels or waffles, has a number of other features that, while not unique, are nonetheless handy.
Cooks who worry about having the toast ready at the same time as the bacon and eggs will like the new toaster's light-emitting diode display. One by one, the lights go off, indicating how much longer the bread must toast to reach the desired brownness.
There is also a beeper inside the unit that announces the completion of the toasting process; this is louder than the familiar popping-up sound.
A built-in bun warmer keeps two pieces of toast warm while two other pieces are toasting. The warmer consists of a pop-up wire shelf. The toaster, which also has a removable crumb tray, will sell for $90.
 Woodlore of Port Washington, Wis., has improved a simple household item: the cedar hanger. The problem with most cedar hangers, said Jay Wilcox, the company president, is that they are designed for shirts rather than expensive suits. They tend to be of the same thickness throughout, he said, and therefore offer no support in the shoulders or neck.
"They basically are no better than wire hangers," Mr. Wilcox said.
Woodlore's new Ultimate Cedar Hanger comes closer to duplicating the human form by being bulkier around the shoulders and neck.
The extra support means that suits hold their shape better and wrinkle less, Mr. Wilcox said.
The company says the hanger, which is 100 percent cedar, will remain naturally aromatic for three years, after which time it can be sanded so that the sweet smell returns. The new hanger will also absorb perspiration in much the same way as cedar shoe trees protect the linings of shoes.
With a suggested retail price of $32.50, the Ultimate Cedar Hanger may be the most expensive hanger around. It is guaranteed for life against such defects as the hook pulling out of the hanger top or the pants bar unscrewing from the hanger body.
 While the Adirondack chair has been a favorite in backyards and at country homes, it has never been known for its comfort. Back support was always questionable in chairs with wide openings between the slats.
 Now designers at Milano Series in Mount Vernon, N.Y., have come up with what they call an ergonomically designed Adirondack chair, which is priced at $125. "It has been updated for the 1990's in terms of design and made more comfortable," said Bruce Parisi, a marketing representative for the company.
First consider the seat of the new chair. Rather than being flat, the seat on the Milano Series chair is curved into a hump for greater comfort and improved posture.
Next consider the back of the chair. The slats are wider than usual to provide greater support. And while many Adirondack chairs are square at the top, the back of the new chair finishes at a point.
Designers have also experimented with Shaker-style furniture. Modulus , a company in Chicago, is importing a line of reproduction Shaker-style furniture made in Malaysia that is almost 100 percent collapsible and that can be shipped via United Parcel Service.
Because the hardware for the Modulus line has already been installed, a leg to a table top, for instance, can be joined by hand without any tools. That holds true for drawers, which come fully assembled with dovetailed joints.
The Shaker furniture includes a night table (suggested retail $190), a coffee table ($230), a single-drawer desk ($300), a sideboard ($580), a mirror ($100), a dining table ($430) and a bureau ($650).

HEADLINE: Whither Design? Thithers Aplenty

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
LOOK backward, angel. To many architects and designers, this seemed to be the credo of the 1980's. Revivals of revivals, neo-Gothic or other, seemed to be the designer's mission.
Enough! many designers have long thought, and more are now saying outright. It seems a fitting time to ask, What in our own time might be considered truly modern? What new influences are inspiring architects and designers? In a dark economic climate, where are the beacons to the future? 
 These questions were put to people who ought to know: architects, product designers, graphics designers and landscape architects. Their answers, which appear here and on page C6, were far reaching. Some found sustenance in ceramic knives and scissors; others, in a growing sensitivity to the natural world. Many are looking to Japan for new forms and technologies.
Given the economic climate, designers seem to be trying to "simplify, rather than elaborate," in the words of Deborah Sussman, a graphics designer in Los Angeles. It is a time of retrenchment, of taking stock.
Having taken the temperature of the current moment, it appears that the patient will live: though this seems to be a period of uncertainty for designers, breakthroughs, both large and small, abound.
Hartmut Esslinger, product designer and founder, Frogdesign, with offices in Menlo Park, Calif.; Altensteig, Germany; Tokyo, and Taipei, Taiwan.
Ceramics as a material are very modern. They're going to be the material for future consumer goods. Kyocera , a Japanese manufacturer, for instance, has introduced a knife and a pair of ceramic scissors with light-blue blades. They're very original. They stay sharp forever, don't rust and have a smooth cut that feels wonderful in the hand.
Philip Johnson, architect, New York City
One thing that comes to mind immediately is the Vitra Museum in Weil, Germany, by Frank Gehry. It's a wild one. It shows an independence from classical presuppositions. The architect has been able to make the most extraordinary curves, and the lighting is especially good: it shows off the furniture. It's a delicious interior.
Kathryn Hiesinger, curator of European decorative arts, Philadelphia Museum of Art
People are looking at thinner and smaller. The objects created by Shiro Kuramata in Japan, for example, are unprecedented in their innovative use of materials and technologies. They don't look like anything else. In his boutiques for Issey Miyake, the steel mesh is practically transparent. He makes the structure and support of objects look insubstantial. There's a wonderful, paradoxical relationship between weight, support and space.
Junichi Arai, another Japanese designer, is exploring new technologies in textile design. His experimental use of computers has resulted in fabrics with triple and quadruple weaves; they pucker in a seersucker effect. He's driven textile technology to new and fabulous degrees.
ID Two 's prototype design for a glass-screened fax machine is truly modern. It's a laptop you can draw on. It's a very clever elimination of one step in the transmittal process.
Eric Chan, product designer and founder, Ecco Design, New York City
Today, the modern approach is understanding emotion. Philippe Starck's juicer for Alessi is an example of a breakthrough design in its use of form to reflect emotions. It simplifies function to its essence and proves that you don't really need gadgetry.
Trying to solve problems with complicated technical solutions feels wrong now. People don't want to add; they want to subtract.
Dakota Jackson, furniture designer, New York City
Two pieces come to mind as modern. The first is the Tango lamp designed by Stephan Copeland for Atelier International . It has an anthropomorphic shape, both futuristic and prehistoric looking at the same time. I also like the chair designed by Joey Mancini and Gaby Dorell for Sawaya & Moroni . It's a simple side chair with somewhat sweeping shapes. It refers to a kitchen chair, yet is far more poetic. Both are modern in a contemporary sense. If you can express that without being historically referential, that's modern.
William McDonough, architect, New York City
Artists are on the forefront in exploring new materials. Interference paint, which we've been working with, gives the architect an ability to model light and color in a way we never have before. It allows you to create three dimensions on a two-dimensional surface.
Michael Graves, architect, Princeton, N.J.
One that springs to mind is Aldo Rossi's Il Palazzo hotel in Fukuoka, Japan. When you see the facade of the building from across the river, it bowls you over. It blends the rational and romantic. It has a power that hasn't been seen in a very long time.
James Wines, architect, Site, New York City
The protection of our natural environment is clearly the major world concern of the 1990's. The question is, What will be the role of architecture?
The notion of "green" buildings integrates architecture with the existing environment. Through the use of gardens, interior courtyards, terraria, landscaped walls and other elements, buildings can become microcosms of the landscape. Rather than solar panels or buried buildings, our inspirations will be Japanese gardens and Frank Lloyd Wright.
Peter Eisenman, architect, New York City
What I see as "new" are not truly modern or revivals. It's a more pluralistic view of architecture: mixing new colors, fragments of the past and science fiction together in strange ways. Just as David Lynch mixes humanity, pathos and terror all at once, we're taking traditional architectural conventions and placing them in shocking contexts, to reveal the hidden meanings of forms. I think you'll see this in our work as well as the work of Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas and Coop Himmelblau .
Tibor Kalman, graphics designer and president, M & Company, New York City
People have really had it with nostalgia. In graphics design, there's a renewed concern with function: how the idea gets communicated, versus style. There's been a rediscovery of modernism. The original modernists rejected decoration in favor of function. I think we have exactly the same moment now.
Kevin Walz, interior designer, New York City
Right now there's very little encouragement to design anything new. I think this period of time is about being safe. We're at the end of a century, and the furniture that was produced at the beginning of the century is a lot more daring than now.
Frederic Schwartz, partner, Anderson/Schwartz Architects , New York City
I think people are tired of "how much more can I lay on" architecture. What tries so hard to be new gets old very quickly.
In contrast, the chapel at Emory University in Atlanta by Max Scogin gets back to the essence of architecture. In one very small place, it captures light, space and craftsmanship in a magical way. It has a spiritual quality.
In our design with R. M. Fischer for the Rector Gate at Battery Park City, the idea was to project classical notions of a gate into the future. There is a whirligig quality.
Bill Moggridge, product designer and founder, ID Two, San Francisco, London and Hanover, Germany
When people stop noticing the electronics and the software, and just see neat features, products become fun to use. The computer part becomes transparent. That's modern.
One of them is the Canon Photura, which I gave my wife for Christmas. It's a one-handed camera, with a built-in telephoto lens and auto-focus,that's convenient for the customer. It doesn't look like a computer. If it had been designed with a software-style approach, she would have become irritated and never used it.
Deyan Sudjic, editor, Blueprint magazine, London
The new design for the Dutch post office by Gert Dumbar looks like an anarchist let loose. This is an unstuffy public design which doesn't try to impress you by looking serious. It redefines what you expect from a post office. It's as if someone redesigned the dollar bill to look like MTV graphics.
Frank Gehry, architect, Los Angeles
Artists like Mike Kelley and Sophie Calle are exploring voyeuristic intimacy and the dark side of our world. There are clues in that for us who are doing architecture. These artists are taking the temperature of the culture.
Eric Owen Moss, architect, Los Angeles
We've just finished the Gary Group office building in Culver City, Calif., which is conceived as a picaresque novel, a series of discontinuous adventures. The wall leans back from the street, destroying the sense of equilibrium. The pieces are not static but moving, connected only in the twisted mind of the architect.
Harvey Bernstein, product designer, Bernstein Design Associates, New York City
Filmless cameras -- the ones that plug into the TV set -- are modern. They're the next generation of photography. Waiting three minutes for a Polaroid picture today is too long.
Deborah Sussman, graphics designer, Sussman/Prejza, Los Angeles
Much of the 80's was about abstract, referential design. One thing that's happening now is a scraping away of the nonessentials. We're trying to simplify, rather than elaborate.
There's a lot of experimentation going on with inexpensive, unexpected materials. Rather than applying paint in a complex way, we're becoming more involved with the actual material. Color is coming from the material itself.
Susan Child, landscape designer, Child Associates, Cambridge, Mass.
One of the most interesting projects is Peter Eisenman's concept for the Banyoles Olympic hotel in Barcelona, Spain. The building relates to the existing agricultural patterns and context of the landscape.
 Stan Eckstut, architect, Ehren krantz, Eckstut & Whitelaw Architects, New York City
If there's anything positive to say about the economic downturn, it's that it's probably forcing everyone to be more careful, think smaller and take more advantage of our limited resources. They say that sometimes the most creative thinking, such as the W.P.A. movement, is done when times are hard. There's more time for thought now, forced or not.

HEADLINE: The Larger Patriotism

 BODY:
The world's hopes for a diplomatic breakthrough at Geneva have been cruelly disappointed. Today Congress begins to debate peace or war; Iraq's intransigence invites an angry vote. What Members of Congress owe America, however, is neither anger nor truculence but their best judgment on what best serves the vital interests of the United States.
At this time, those interests would not be served by the offensive use of military force to expel Iraq from Kuwait. 
 It would be a mistake for Congress to confuse patriotism with blind loyalty to the President. A strong America is a democratic America, functioning in accordance with the constitutional design. The larger patriotism is to be wise, not merely tough.
From the start, this newspaper has supported Operation Desert Shield, President Bush's deployment of a multinational force to defend Saudi Arabia. We have supported the international embargo that is daily making Saddam Hussein pay for his aggression in Kuwait, and steadily weakens his military potential. And we have supported the President's able assemblage of a broad coalition against naked aggression.
Nor do we shrink from the ultimate prospect of war. There are circumstances that justify, even compel, the sacrifices of war. But those circumstances are not now present.
America's vital interests in the Middle East -- the security of oil supplies and the security of strategic allies -- are in no imminent danger. As for pushing Iraq out of Kuwait, the embargo remains a plausible lever. The evidence so far, not conclusive but strong, is that it is steadily grinding Iraq down.
Saddam Hussein's crimes offend most Americans, most Arabs and most of the world. But the right response now is not a U.S.-led attack. For Congress to authorize an immediate use of force under these circumstances would be unwise. And to sign off instead on a blank check, leaving it to the President to fill in a future date, would be a dereliction of constitutional duty.
Even if it should come, war promises no neat solution. A limited war that left much of Baghdad's military capability intact would only inflame future crises with a heightened sense of Iraqi grievance. Yet an all-out war that destroyed Iraq's military potential would create a destabilizing power vacuum adjacent to both Iran and Syria.
Nor do America's allies in the broad anti-Iraq coalition insist on immediate war. Quite the contrary. France, one of the U.N. Security Council's five permanent members, even now presses for a diplomatic solution. Many allies endorse fighting in Kuwait but not in Iraq. If, as the Administration fears, the coalition is weakening, that's true precisely because of the imminent threat of force, not any strains arising from the long-term embargo.
Congress's constitutional war-making authority fell into disuse during the cold war. Under the thermonuclear shadow, Presidents brushed aside the deliberative mechanisms designed to protect against premature or reckless war. The decisions before Congress now call for a return to constitutional norms.
First, the members must reassert their right to decide when and whether to go to war. Then, turning to the President's request for authority to use force now, they should trust evidence instead of sentiment. So far, America's vital interests are protected; there's reason to believe the embargo is working; the deadline of Jan. 15 is arbitrary.
If circumstances should change, there will be time for a fresh look. For now, the wise, brave vote on war is no.

HEADLINE: Sophomore Year;
Mr. Dinkins Turns Wishful

 BODY:
To think back to Mayor David Dinkins's inaugural last January is to reflect, sadly, on what has happened to him and his city in just one year. The inauguration was a moment of excitement and promise; even the broadening signs of fiscal trouble could not still the enthusiasm. Then reality hit. The economy got worse, and the Mayor's life became one problem after another.
Mr. Dinkins thus begins his second year as a very different Mayor. He speaks of hope, but so great are the city's struggles that his State of the City speech this week was less convincing than dutiful. It could hardly have been otherwise. A relentlessly growing budget deficit means that his only options are painful ones. And that may be why Mr. Dinkins used his speech, traditionally a public relations opportunity, to offer more hopes than plans, and to spend more time praising New Yorkers than promising what he can do for them. 
 "New Yorkers do not give up; they simply change the rules," he said in one of his more positive lines. But it was less than heartwarming to hear him try to fashion virtue from adversity. Elsewhere he noted that because of falling real estate prices, New York is no longer the most expensive city to live in. That may be true; but the depressed real estate market is hardly a sign of health and vitality.
Mr. Dinkins emphasized important issues, including gun control, juvenile justice and fiscal stability. The last of these was particularly welcome, since the Mayor's performance in managing the city's finances has been uneven, if not downright alarming. But even if he had avoided his most serious fiscal mistake -- approving labor settlements that will cost the city dearly in layoffs and service cuts -- the city would still be reeling from forces no mayor can control.
New York's 106th Mayor finds himself struggling just to stay in place. What his city can hope is that a year of adversity has prepared and toughened him for the difficulties ahead.

Mr. Florio Tiptoes Into 1991

 BODY:
A chastened Gov. Jim Florio proposes nothing bold for New Jersey this year. Scorched by the uproar over last year's hefty tax bill and increased aid to poor school districts at the expense of those better off, he carefully avoided new controversy in his State of the State address. Mr. Florio is presumably more interested in retaining Democratic control of the Legislature in the November elections than in making new waves.
If 1991 plays out as the Governor says, New Jersey faces the recession in good shape because last year "we made choices that others are just starting to face up to." But even before he spoke, the State Senate's Democratic leaders were threatening a $450 million raid on the new school aid funds to pay for statewide property tax relief. Their proposal is irresponsible, but a clear warning to Mr. Florio that he must give some ground. 
 The Governor said little about the $600 million budget deficit. Obviously, the window for new taxes is shut. He proposes unspecified savings from mergers of state agencies and from letting private garages make the state's auto emission inspections. But he and the Legislature have yet to deal with the harsh reality of still more cuts.
Mr. Florio's initiatives were modest and meritorious, and for the most part wouldn't worsen the budget problem. He would fight unemployment with $400 million from the transportation trust fund, to pay for highway work. He calls again for two worthy bond issues: $600 million to fix up rundown schools, and $135 million to subsidize affordable housing. And he endorses a proposal for $50 million of tax-free savings bonds that could be used to pay college tuition. He wants to tackle health care for the uninsured and child care, too, but hasn't spelled out how.
Well-spoken and compassionate, Mr. Florio offers sensibly restrained plans for steering his state through a difficult year.

The Letter Rejected

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein's Foreign Minister took in hand the letter from the President of the United States, read it carefully, and answered it in the most contemptuous way available to nations: he passed it back across the table, refusing to "receive" it.
The representative of the nation that reintroduced poison gas to modern warfare, used hostages as human shields and is now systematically pillaging its Arab neighbor -- this man was instructed to say that the tone of the communication from Mr. Bush was insufficiently polite. 
 So ended the "phony war." After five months of wishful thinking in the West and ringing rhetoric in Baghdad, the regime in Iraq made clear to the world in the most insulting way possible that it is not about to give up its conquest of oil-rich Kuwait.
We can now clear our minds of self-delusion. This includes:
1. We are not communicating with the Iraqi leader; if only he knew of the firmness of the world's resolve, he would stop miscalculating.
The problem has never been lack of communication. As Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz made clear, Baghdad is well aware of what the world wants and what power the U.S. has in place to enforce its demands.
2. Give sanctions a couple of years to work, and economic strangulation will bring Iraq to its knees.
This satisfies those who want to do nothing but seem to do something; it dresses weakness in a tough jacket. Thus we hear "stay the course," and "tighten the noose"; in reality, the embargo is more annoyance than siege, and is already being breached by Iran, Jordan and the Soviet Union.
3. Saddam Hussein may be an assassin by profession, and responsible for two invasions and more than a million deaths to date, but he is not irrational; he will recognize the reality of superior power.
This foolishly projects onto him the view from our side. From his side, he sees the ground forces arrayed against him and assumes that we will wage his kind of trench warfare. With the help of poison gas, he defeated a neighboring nation nearly triple his population. With more blood to expend -- and he is prepared to lose another half-million Iraqis -- he thinks the world's forces will tire and make a deal.
4. A compromise is easy to envision: give him a couple of islands as access to the gulf, plus a fig leaf of linkage to the Palestinian cause, and he'll be willing to pull out of Kuwait.
The woods are filled with pundits and diplomats certain of his willingness to withdraw under the proper inducement, but whenever the opportunity arises -- he concedes nothing. The "deal" is in the mind of the aggression-rewarders; in Saddam Hussein's mind, Kuwait is his 19th province.
5. We want a peaceful solution, and would be content with his withdrawal.
A peace (to which he shows no sign of agreeing) that would permit him to build long-range missiles and to equip them with nuclear, germ-warfare and chemical warheads is no peace at all but an invitation to a war in the mid-90's at a high cost to the U.S. civilian population.
6. Once he sees we're serious, or united, or ready -- he'll cave.
A dozen U.N. resolutions, a deadline, an invisible Congress and implacable President, with massed troops and air power ready -- what further proof does he need? He knows what is coming, and he is not caving.
7. But he's not crazy -- he knows he'll lose; at the 11th hour, he'll become reasonable.
This is another bite at the rationality apple. If he cannot draw us into a long land war, he faces the prospect of defeat; but by cloaking his land-grab in a pan-Arab cause, he sees martyrdom ahead. Never a religious man, he does not see this as a way to Heaven, but his consuming ego envisions a Viking's funeral, with his nation the burning boat.
8. Air power has never won a war.
Give modern air power a chance to decide this war, with a two-front invasion on the ground from north and south in the final stages. Not all Iraqis are loyal to the dictator; we can encourage a Kurdish uprising and a military coup. Because Iraq is the center of world terrorism, we must expect counterattack from that quarter, but we are moving now to prevent terrorists from gaining nuclear arms.
The spurned letter means the time for self-delusion is over. Let Congress express its resolve in a resolution. And let the White House make public the undelivered mail: the world should read the message that was too direct and forceful for the tender eyes of Saddam Hussein.

HEADLINE: Why New York State Faces Crisis and Must Resort to Layoffs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The impact on individuals, programs and operations of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's deficit reduction plan has generated much discussion, particularly among New York State employees. This has centered on two basic questions: 
 (1) Why is the state suddenly facing an economic crisis?
(2) Why is the Governor using layoffs and other work-force saving plans for state employees, instead of eliminating waste in government?
These are legitimate questions.
As the news media have reported for months, much of the country is in a severe recession. The impact is felt by New York and many other states, with massive budget deficits in Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas and California. The Associated Press reported that a survey conducted by the National Conference of State Legislators found two-thirds of the states expect major difficulty in balancing their budgets. Conditions appear to be deteriorating faster than in the recession years of the early 1980's.
The impact of the national economic downturn, exacerbated by the invasion of Kuwait and its effect on oil prices, has caused a serious decline in state revenues. Combined with decreased Federal funding, the effect on New York's finances has been dramatic and inescapable. New York has had to take immediate steps.
The deficit reduction plan will produce savings of $1 billion without new taxes and will meet the requirements of fiscal soundness to protect the state's credit rating. It cuts all areas of the budget: more than 60 percent is local aid, including aid for education and social services. Nearly 30 percent of the spending reductions are in state agency costs.
The furlough plan proposed by the Governor would have reduced the number of layoffs needed this year to about 2,000. The deferred compensation plan that the Legislature enacted instead meets all the fiscal requirements and accomplishes the same objectives as the Governor's furlough proposal. Without adoption of one of these plans, many thousand more layoffs would be required. Despite public opposition by union leaders, many rank and file employees have expressed support for measures that ultimately reduce layoffs.
While the fiscal situation demands dramatic spending cuts, efforts to improve productivity and efficiency in state government have reduced the people and programs affected. The portion of the budget spent on state purposes has been reduced from 25.9 percent in 1983-84 to 22.4 percent this fiscal year. We have instituted hiring freezes, sold surplus state property, cut back on consultants and travel, closed outmoded facilities, reduced the state's passenger car fleet by 25 percent and have improved operations through the Governor's Office of Management and Productivity.
However, the deficit reduction plan and these initiatives do not eliminate the necessity of further budget cuts next year. These are not choices that are made lightly.
New York has responded to challenge with intelligence and innovation. In this time of fiscal stringency, we will have to reassess priorities and redirect resources to insure that we provide quality services. We welcome the public employee unions to work to continue the tradition of excellence.

HEADLINE: We Can't Afford Big Science's Price Anymore

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Would that Marvin L. Goldberger and Wolfgang P. K. Panofsky were right in "All Science, Great and Small" (Op-Ed, Dec. 22): that the debate between small science and big science could come to an end; that the debate on choices of future scientific projects could be based only on scientific merit, irrespective of relative costs. Unfortunately, the ivory tower of basic scientific research must occasionally open its doors to the world around it, and that world has finite financial resources. 
 Since the end of World War II, we have accorded science a special place among intellectual and cultural disciplines and spent more public money on it than, for example, on theater, music and philosophy. We have done this not because we are enamored of science as an intellectual discipline, but rather because we believe it serves our national needs. We believe that it has the capacity to provide us with a higher standard of living, greater longevity, improved economic and military security, and generally a better quality of life. And that belief more often than not has proved to be correct.
In good economic times we have had the luxury of being able to support a wide range of scientific activity with little regard for the potential long-term social benefits of individual projects. During the 1960's we were able to provide more than adequate Federal funding for large-scale and small-scale projects, for individual university investigators and for major national facilities. Today, as a result of Federal tax policies enacted during the 1980's, we have less Federal money for basic scientific research. At the same time, scientific research has become more expensive, reflecting the growth of technological complexity.
Our diminished resources now force us to make hard choices. One of those is whether or not we can afford big science projects, particularly if our commitment results in inadequate overall support for small science. The question is not whether or not big science is ipso facto less desirable than small science, but whether or not the relatively fixed pot of Federal dollars is better spent on many small projects that have relatively greater educational and potentially greater economic benefits than on a very small number of megaprojects that are extremely meritorious scientifically, but have few rationales for their pursuit save the advancement of intellectual knowledge.
The 1990 budget compromise, which has fixed the size of the pot for the next five years, forces us to make these choices. As an educator, as a researcher in big and small science projects for 20 years, as a politician, and as an advisor to politicians, I must conclude that until we alter our national taxing and spending priorities we simply cannot afford megaprojects such as the space station and the superconducting supercollider. Deep down I suspect that Messrs. Goldberger and Panofsky must also agree.

HEADLINE: Trade U.S. Food and Goods for Soviet Oil

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The United States and the Soviet Union are now at a unusual juncture of interlocking needs and resources. A bold trade would resolve many of each country's problems for the present and the future. 
 The needs: The Soviet Union needs food and consumer goods; the United States needs a stable supply of reasonably priced oil.
The resources: the Soviet Union has the world's largest oil reserves; the United States has tremendous oil-drilling expertise and equipment, and underused production capabilities in farming and consumer goods.
Clearly, we should gear up our farms and factories for full production, put all our workers back to work, trade the food and goods for $16 a barrel Soviet oil, end our recession and at the same time end Soviet shortages and domestic turmoil. Such an exchange arrangement could also cool down the Middle East because it would end everyone's dependency on that region's oil.
This interim solution to our problems would allow the politics and economies of both countries to set new and appropriate courses for the next century, based on the necessary premise of cooperation, rather than on conflict.
Domestically, it would allow us to refocus our energies and resources on solving our problems, including education, housing and the urban infrastructure. Abroad, it would allow us to play our part in helping the rest of the world.

HEADLINE: We Can't Afford Big Science's Price Anymore;
Home-Growing Centers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Needed: Home-Grown Talent" (editorial, Dec. 26) joins the chorus calling for dramatic improvements in the development of home-grown scientists and mathematicians. You also identify some of the necessary ingredients: start early, make it user-friendly, teach science literacy to the entire population. 
 However, you do not mention one of the popular tools for accomplishing this. Throughout the United States, in every large city and in a remarkable number of smaller ones, there is a science museum or science center that makes an important contribution. The typical institution of this sort (the Exploratorium of San Francisco is a highly regarded example) introduces science to children -- often preschool -- using hands-on, interactive exhibits to enable them to see, feel, touch and therefore understand science and technology.
New York City has but one, the Hall of Science at the World's Fair ground in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens. Soon, the Liberty Science Center, under development on the New Jersey side of New York Harbor, will provide another such resource for the region. Finally, a new one is being planned to serve the high-tech community of Long Island, to be called the Long Island Museum of Science & Technology and probably to be in central Nassau County.
While these science centers in no sense take the place of the primary and secondary school system, they are vital adjuncts and need support from the private and public sectors. In a time of recession, they should be seen as prerequisites to a healthy economy.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Fails in Plan to Sell Giant Texas Development

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The Government's plan to sell a prized 6,200-acre real estate development north of Dallas to a Japanese businessman collapsed late Tuesday after he said he could not obtain financing.
The collapse of the deal for the sprawling community of expensive homes and scenic golf courses called Stonebridge Ranch seems certain to increase a bill to taxpayers on the project earlier estimated at $270 million. The savings and loan that had backed the development was seized by the Government two years ago. 
 The decision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation late Tuesday to break off talks with Yukio Kitano, an Osaka industrialist who had agreed last June to acquire Stonebridge for $61 million, underscores the increasing trouble the Government faces in finding buyers for large, costly real estate projects.
Plummeting Japanese stock and real estate values since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, and fears of approaching war, have forced Japanese banks to sharply restrict their overseas lending. Mr. Kitano had counted on those banks for much of the money he needed to buy Stonebridge.
A lawyer in Dallas who represented Mr. Kitano, Clay Mulford, said talks with the Government would continue and Mr. Kitano hoped an agreement could be reached on "mutually satisfactory terms."
The vast Stonebridge property, situated on rolling prairie land 35 minutes north of downtown Dallas and 43 miles south of the Oklahoma border, was acquired and developed between 1983 and mid-1990 at a cost of $300 million to $330 million.
Most of the money came from Gibraltar Savings, a large Texas savings institution. With two high-quality golf courses, 13 man-made lakes, a beach, an elaborate club house and tennis center, stables and five miles of bicycle and bridle paths, Stonebridge was considered one of the most ambitious developments conceived in Texas during the state's boom years in the early 1980's.
The project was managed until 1989 by Richard C. Strauss, a son of Robert S. Strauss, the influential Washington lawyer who was chairman of the Democratic Party during the Carter Administration. The senior Mr. Strauss was a director at Gibraltar Savings, whose chairman, J. Livingston Kosberg, was a prominent fund-raiser in Texas for the Democratic Party.
Mr. Kosberg and the Strausses no longer have any involvement at Stonebridge. Gibraltar Savings and a sister institution, First Texas Savings, were declared insolvent by the Government in 1988. The two institutions were later sold, along with three smaller institutions, for $315 million to a group headed by Ronald O. Perelman, the investor and chairman of Revlon Inc.
That newly capitalized institution operates as First Gibraltar, and is the largest savings unit in Texas, with more than $11 billion in assets.
 
$7 Million for Maintenance
 Real estate professionals in North Texas said a prospective bidder for the Stonebridge land and facilities faced annual costs of approximately $7 million to maintain the property and its amentities. In addition to those costs and the interest charges on money borrowed to buy Stonebridge, a new owner must construct roads, pay utilities and oversee other development services required by home builders.
Stonebridge has been one of the more popular new residential developments in the Dallas-Fort Worth area since it opened in 1988. The Government said 380 homes, ranging in price from $75,000 to more than $1 million, are occupied. Home builders own another 200 developed lots, as well as enough land to construct another 150 homes. Zoning eventually would allow 27,500 homes and 91 million square feet of retail, commercial, office, research and industrial space.
 
Slow Development Pace
 Yet many local brokers say the current pace of home development at Stonebridge is too slow to provide enough of a return for investors unwilling to stay with the project for 20 years or more. A spokesman for the F.D.I.C. said Government officials familiar with Stonebridge were not available to comment on the project today.
One person familiar with the development raised the prospect that the Government might be forced to sell Stonebridge for far less than $20 million.
"It is extraordinarily difficult to finance anything in real estate right now," said David Shulman, managing director and head of real estate research at Salomon Brothers, in New York. "Raw land only has value to a developer, but if there is a limited market for developed product, then there is very little value for the land. Most of what the R.T.C. owns on the commercial side is land. And that's the problem." The R.T.C., or the Resolution Trust Corporation, is the agency in charge of the Government savings and loan bailout.
The deal with Mr. Kitano had been scheduled to close last Sept. 13, but regulators extended the deadline twice. The financing delays in Japan forced Mr. Kitano to forfeit $4.9 million he had advanced last summer to the Government.
In a statement, the Government said it had ended the talks with Mr. Kitano because of his "continuing difficulties in obtaining financing." It was unclear whether the F.D.I.C. would conduct another private auction for the property, or negotiate privately with other bidders. The Government said it soon planned to announce how it would market the property.
Stonebridge is situated 15 minutes from a large corporate office park in Plano, Tex., where the J.C. Penney Company is building a new headquarters. Electronic Data Systems and the Frito-Lay division of Pepsico Inc. have also built sprawling, campus-style headquarters there in the last five years.
Stonebridge is in the town of McKinney, Tex. Town officials said Stonebridge was zoned to eventually house between 45,000 and 60,000 people. "We want the long-term issue of ownership at Stonebridge resolved as soon as possible," said Thomas E. Palmer, head of the town's economic development agency.
The land development subsidiary of the Mobil Corporation seriously considered making a bid for Stonebridge last year but later backed away, said John Lord, a Mobil spokesman. He said he could not comment on whether Mobil might still be interested. The Mobil unit is a major developer in Reston, Va., where it is based.
H. Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire, has also had an interest in the property, according to Dallas real estate professionals. In an interview, Mr. Perot denied bidding for Stonebridge last year, but he sounded as though he had closely followed the Government's talks with Mr. Kitano.
"At some point, they'll decide they want to sell it in a hard money deal," Mr. Perot said, referring to property sales officials at the F.D.I.C. "Their basic problem is that they prefer a soft deal at a big number, rather than a lower bid with real money behind it."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 14, 1991, Monday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about the Government's inability to sell a real estate development near Dallas misstated the involvement of Robert S. Strauss, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in the Gibraltar Savings Association, a Texas institution that was declared insolvent in 1988. Mr. Strauss owned stock in Gibraltar Savings but did not serve as a director.

HEADLINE: Metro-North Chief Is Called Choice to Head M.T.A.

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Peter E. Stangl, president of the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, has been chosen by the Governor's selection committee as the next chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, high-ranking officials of the state authority said yesterday.
Mr. Stangl, who had been rumored to be the leading candidate, would succeed Robert R. Kiley, who resigned in November after seven years with the authority to become president and chief executive of the Fischbach Corporation, an electrical engineering concern. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is expected to meet with Mr. Stangl today and then announce his appointment. 
 Mary Ann Crotty, deputy director for state operations in the Governor's office, said that while Mr. Cuomo was close to naming a new M.T.A. chairman, no final decision had been made.
Mr. Stangl's turnaround of Metro-North and his political and personal skills won him the nomination for the M.T.A. post, transit officials said.
 
More Trains on Time Now
 When Mr. Stangl was named president of Metro-North in 1983, the railroad, which is part of the M.T.A., was considered one of the worst in the nation. Trains were consistently late, crowded, uncomfortably hot and filthy.
Metro-North, which provides rail service to commuters between New York City and Westchester and Connecticut, now stands head and shoulders above other railroads in the region and beyond. About 90 percent of its trains are on time, it has more of them, and the cars are clean and air-conditioned. While ridership on the city's subways and other rail systems has declined, Metro-North's has increased.
At the M.T.A., Mr. Stangl would oversee a vast network of state transit agencies including the Transit Authority, which operates the city's subways and buses; the Long Island Rail Road; the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and Metro-North. Many of those agencies are facing swelling operating deficits and declining ridership.
 
A Former Professor
 Mr. Stangl, a 49-year-old former economics professor, has worked in mass transit in New York and New Jersey for 20 years.
"Peter is clearly an expert transit manager, but more than that, he knows how to deal with people," said Jo Ann Katzban, associate director of the M.T.A.'s Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, a consumer advocacy group. "He's formal, but he still has a lot of warmth in his dealings."
Perhaps the biggest challenge the authority's new chairman faces is persuading legislators to approve a $12 billion capital plan when the region's economy is in a decline and state and city governments face huge deficits.
 
Need to Be Forceful
 "We hope he does well and increases ridership the way he has done at Metro-North," said Joseph Rappaport, a spokesman for the Straphangers Campaign, a subway riders' group. "The challenge for the new chairman will be to get a new capital improvement program in place and that means being a forceful, visible spokesman for transit up in Albany and to the business community and to riders."
Thomas F. Egan, chairman of the M.T.A.'s Metro-North committee, said Mr. Stangl "stakes his reputation on his ability to confront a problem and find the long-term solution" and "doesn't like to take short cuts." For example, to avoid service cuts in times of economic decline, Mr. Stangl has reduced Metro-North's reliance on government subsidies by controlling costs like travel budgets for rail officials and by raising productivity, Mr. Egan said.
Since 1984, he has reduced Metro-North's employees by 520 to 5,800 positions without layoffs and has cut overtime 37.5 percent. The railroad's operating expenses have risen 12.6 percent since 1984, compared with a 26.3 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index.
Metro-North executives and workers say that while he is personable, he is a demanding boss who has been known to scream and pound his fists on his desk when upset and also to dismiss an employee who does not work quickly enough. "You have to be smart, sharp and fast to work for him because he a no-nonsense guy," said a Metro-North official who asked not to be identified.
Metro-North officials said yesterday that Mr. Stangl was declining all interviews concerning his possible appointment as M.T.A. chairman.
Mr. Stangl, who was born in Waterbury, Conn., graduated from the University of Connecticut. He did graduate work in economics at the University of Connecticut and later taught at Wheaton College in Norton, Mass.
 
In Lindsay Administration
 He worked as a program planner for the New York City Budget Bureau in 1970 and later as an assistant administrator for public transportation in Mayor John V. Lindsay's administration. From 1974 to 1978, he was assistant commissioner for public transportation in New Jersey.
After a brief period as a public policy consultant, Mr. Stangl joined the M.T.A. in 1980 as assistant executive director for policy and operations and oversaw Conrail's management of the Hudson, Harlem and New Haven lines. He became president of Metro-North, which took over operations from Conrail in 1983.
Perhaps Mr. Stangl's biggest asset as a public-service manager, transit officials said, is his desire to please the customer. Once, when a Metro-North train crew skipped a station in the Bronx, Mr. Stangl demanded that the crew members apologize to each passenger on the train the next day.

Rochester Telephone In Deal With Centel

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Two large independent telephone companies signed an agreement yesterday to exchange operations in a deal involving cash and stock.
The Rochester Telephone Corporation agreed to buy the Centel Corporation's local phone operations in Minnesota and Iowa for $100 million in cash, 2.8 million shares of new Rochester Telephone stock and the Rochester company's minority stakes in the cellular telephone franchises in 20 cities and towns. 
 The new shares of Rochester Telephone were worth $82.2 million at yesterday's closing price of $28.50 a share on the New York Stock Exchange. Alvin S. Mirman, a telephone industry analyst at Gruntal & Company, estimated that the minority stakes would fetch about $67 million if sold separately, giving the deal a value of about $250 million.
Rochester Telephone and Centel's shares both fell 12.5 cents each yesterday, with Centel's closing at $28.25.
The companies said they expected the deal to close by midyear.
The new stock will give the Chicago-based Centel a 9.1 percent stake in Rochester Telephone. Centel also signed an agreement that neither it nor any acquirer of Centel would seek to increase the stake to more than 10 percent before the end of 1995.
"Centel is a company we respect a great deal, and we feel very confident having them as a major stockholder," said Alan C. Hasselwander, Rochester Telephone's president and chief executive.
Companies within an industry sometimes arrange stock deals when they fear hostile takeovers, to place shares in friendly hands. Mr. Hasselwander and John P. Frazee Jr., Centel's chairman and chief executive, said in separate telephone interviews that neither concerns had been approached recently by anyone interested in buying a large or majority stake.
Mr. Hasselwander said Rochester Telephone had decided in early 1988 that it wanted to diversify by having at least a third of its local telephone operations outside New York State. Rochester Telephone then stepped up its purchases of small-town telephone companies.
The acquisition of Centel's Minnesota and Iowa operations will give Rochester Telephone about 825,000 access lines, with 35 percent of them outside New York State. Rochester Telephone retains cellular franchises in New York State, Alabama, Iowa, Kansas and Georgia.
Mr. Frazee said Centel, twice the size of Rochester Telephone, found the Minnesota and Iowa units too small to operate economically.

Mideast Standoff's Effect on Business

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE markets reacted with alarm to what President Bush called a "total stiff-arm" by Iraq at the Geneva talks between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz. And it looks as though the markets and business decision-makers will have to live with extreme uncertainty on war or peace, not just for a few days but possibly for weeks or months.
What will be the economic consequences of this confrontation? Nobody knows; the crisis in the Persian Gulf appears to have blown the art or science of economic forecasting out of the water. Everything now depends on whether there will be war or peace, and what kind of war or peace it will be. 
 Some analysts say that what lies ahead is a stalemate that will be agonizing for business and the markets. Roger E. Brinner, chief economist of DRI/McGraw-Hill, said that given the necessity for business planning of making explicit assumptions about Iraq's future occupation of Kuwait and the implications for oil prices, DRI "assumes that rumors of war and hopes for peace will alternate in ascendancy throughout the winter and spring," adding, "If war means $50 a barrel for oil and peace means $20, then markets today are betting 2 to 1 on peace and thus establishing a trading range near $30."
Every flicker of hope or fear drives oil prices up or down wildly. On Wednesday, when the failed talks in Geneva turned hope into fear, the oil price shot up 30 percent in 5 minutes, to $31 from $24.
The oil market, like any other market, is driven by information, psychology and an effort to guess how other traders will react to new information. But if, in coming days or weeks, the oil price showsa tendency to move up to a much higher trading range, say, above $40, it would mean that the information, open or covert, that the market is getting has strongly shifted the odds toward war.
John Steinbrenner, director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said on Wednesday morning that he was "betting against war." His reasoning was that the confrontation between Iraq and the United States and the other Western nations is "really about money" and that "Saddam gets more if he deals now than if he forces a fight."
But the issue is whether a deal is possible if the Administration sticks to its position of "not rewarding aggression." Mr. Steinbrenner suggested that a deal was possible to get Iraq out of Kuwait if it enabled Iraq to get its oil out and provide it with substantial investment capital for economic development, with the money coming primarily from the other oil states that have made large windfall profits from the confrontation, and from international bodies, like the World Bank or International Monetary Fund.
War, he said, would be devastating to Iraq's interests. But the doubters say this argument falselyassumes that President Hussein is rational; they insist he is a power-crazed dictator, and rewarding him would only feed his appetite. This is the "Hitler" analogy, which President Bush himself has used. But those who still think a deal is possible say that despite President Hussein's threats of "rivers of blood," he is still making the most of his negotiating power and will make a deal at the final moment.
Peter G. Peterson, head of the Blackstone Group and a former Secretary of Commerce, said his intuition was that "all the signals Saddam is sending out" make him think the Iraqi leader is looking for a deal.
Mr. Peterson, an experienced negotiator himself, said his friends in the diplomatic world have told him that this is the way the Arabs bargain: "It is almost digital," he said. "They say no, no, no, day after day, until one morning they do a fast turnaround and say yes." But that morning had not come this week in Geneva and it now seems unlikely to come before or immediately after Jan. 15.
So what if, as President Bush and Secretary Baker have warned, Saddam Hussein has again miscalculated and war comes before a deal? Robert J. Eggert, president and chief economist of Blue Chip Economic Indicators, said the Administration and the large majority of economists he surveys are expecting a short and moderate recession in 1991, "counting on the rejuvenative power of the American economy."
"But if war erupts and the conflict drags on for more than a few weeks," he said, "current optimism that the recession will prove to be relatively short and shallow may evaporate as fast as water in the desert."
Indeed, in the event of a long war, economic policy would confront a whole new ball game, with the oil price soaring, the budget deficit climbing over $400 billion for 1991, the costs of waging the war mounting rapidly, a need for raising taxes -- and other pains not yet contemplated.
Oil closed at $27.71 yesterday, up 45 cents, and the odds are still against war.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. View Of Recession

BYLINE: REUTERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund believes the recession in the United States will be short and not very deep, the fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, said today.
"It looks as though the present decline in the U.S. will be short and relatively shallow," Mr. Camdessus told a gathering at the National Press Club. 
 He declined to say what the economic effect of a war in the Middle East would be, noting that financial problems would be small when compared with the human suffering.
He did say that he believes the world economy would adjust to oil prices if they were to steady at around $26 a barrel over a long period. This would be about 50 percent higher than the level before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
Mr. Camdessus praised the Federal Reserve, which has been pushing down interest rates to revive the economy. Its last credit easing came on Tuesday, when it nudged the overnight Federal funds rate down a quarter of a point, to 6.75 percent.
"I am impressed," he said, "by how careful the Federal Reserve has been in allowing some easing of credit to support the economy but in a way that seeks to safeguard against inflation."
Answering questions from reporters, Mr. Camdessus said he was not opposed to further loosening by the Federal Reserve, as long as such a policy did not involve pumping up the economy without regard to the effect on inflation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Slides in New York After Hectic Asian Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar slipped yesterday against most major foreign currencies as traders caught their breath after Wednesday's unnerving market session.
Among precious metals, gold fell slightly in New York after rising in earlier overseas markets. It closed down 80 cents an ounce, to $390.40, on the New York Commodity Exchange. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $390.50 an ounce, down 75 cents from Wednesday's close. 
 Currency dealers said trading represented mostly a follow-through from volatile overnight trading in Asia, when foreign traders drove the dollar down and then up amid conflicting sentiments about chances for peace in the Persian Gulf.
"By the time New York came in today, the moves were over," said Maria Nordone, vice president and sales manager for the Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles.
"It should be quiet until we get the next directive on whether there will be a war or not," she said.
The quiet trading contrasted with the wild swings Wednesday in reaction to the breakdown in United States-Iraq talks to resolve the Middle East crisis peacefully. The dollar had been down before the breakdown in the talks but jumped sharply on the announcement, which helped the currency's safe-harbor appeal.
Yesterday, though, "nobody went out and bought dollars or sold dollars," said Thomas J. Palladino, currency trader at Oesterreichische Landerbank in New York. "We're in a holding pattern," he added. "The longer we stay in a holding pattern, the greater chance the dollar will come off based on economic fundamentals."
Mr. Palladino said a key currency movement yesterday was a weakening of the German mark against the Japanese yen after tough talk from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that he might impose direct Kremlin rule on the rebellious republic of Lithuania unless it complied with national laws.
However, foreign exchange dealers in Europe said the volume was limited and the day's trading range for the dollar was established in Asian dealings before European trading opened.
The dollar fell more than two yen in New York trading against the Japanese currency, closing at 134.50, down from Wednesday's 137.05. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar dropped to 135.10 Japanese yen from Wednesday's closing 136.83. In London later yesterday, the dollar traded lower at 134.70 yen.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.5270 marks, from 1.5400 in New York.
In London, one British pound cost $1.9055 late yesterday, down from Wednesday's late $1.9260. Sterling closed stronger in New York, fetching $1.9122, more than late Wednesday's $1.8970.

Scott Paper Effort To Sell Off Assets

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 10

 BODY:
The Scott Paper Company said it would sell off some assets to improve its earnings potential and reduce debt as the economy headed into recession. The company also said it would reduce capital spending, lower working capital and intensify cost-reduction efforts.
Scott said the assets that would be sold are most of its food-service business; its specialty paper businesses, including a paper mill in Westbrook, Me., and a converting plant in Belgium, and its bulk nonwovens business, with manufacturing sites in the United States and Germany. Scott's chairman and chief executive, Philip E. Lippincott, said the company would concentrate on its core businesses of personal-care and cleaning products and quality coated printing paper.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Speculators Help to Raise Prices

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Speculators, apparently gambling that peace in the Persian Gulf still has a chance, buoyed the Treasury securities market yesterday by stepping up and buying notes and bonds.
Yesterday's gains, which amounted to more than a point for some long-term bonds, more than erased the market's sharp drop on Wednesday afternoon, after Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d told reporters that talks with the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, had not brought the parties any closer to a settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis. 
 It may prove fleeting, but a sense that a solution to the crisis may be found re-emerged again yesterday, after the United Nations General Secretary, Javier Perez de Cuellar, disclosed the outlines of a proposal he will present to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq over the weekend.
"There is still hope that Perez de Cuellar's trip will accomplish something," said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities. "There is also a thought going through the market that a war, if it happens, will be so contractionary for the economy that it will make the recession that much worse."
The price rebound began during overnight trading in Tokyo, continued when trading shifted to London and was sustained once activity began in American financial markets.
 
Nervousness of Participants
 Nevertheless, the market's extreme volatility over the last few days merely underscored how nervous participants are about the Middle East.
"There is a bit of lunacy in the way positions are being handled by speculators, be they dealers or others," said William Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities.
"There is probably no more rationality behind the big rally today than in yesterday's big drop in prices," said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 104 5/8, up nearly 1 1/2 points, or nearly $15 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.32 percent, compared with 8.45 percent late Wednesday.
After running up sharply early on Wednesday, bond prices tumbled more than 2 points from their highs after the results of the meeting between Mr. Baker and Mr. Aziz were disclosed, and closed at a price to yield 8.45 percent.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 8 1/2 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 17/32 late yesterday, up 26/32, to yield 8.11 percent. And the 7 1/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 9/32, up 3/ 32, to yield 7.09 percent.
Dealers said demand at an auction for more than $11 billion of new one-year Treasury bills was strong.
The notes were sold at an average discount rate of 6.22 percent. The rate was down sharply from the 6.58 percent rate at the last one-year bill auction on Dec. 13, and is the lowest rate in nearly three years.
 
Treasury Bill Rates Rise
 Interest rates on outstanding Treasury bills rose slightly yesterday, reversing some of the steep plunge recorded on Wednesday.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.24 percent, up six basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by four basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.30 percent.
The overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, which has gyrated wildly for the last few days, traded in a somewhat narrower range yesterday. The funds rate traded as high as 7 1/4 percent and as low as 6 1/2 percent. Earlier this week the Fed was widely seen as lowering its target for the funds rate, the money market rate it most directly controls, by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 6.75 percent.
Big price swings will probably be evident again today, as traders position themselves in advance of the Perez de Cueller visit to Baghdad.
"There will be great skittishness on Friday," a bond trader said. "People won't want to be buying or holding securities if the news out of the Middle East is terrible. But they won't want to be selling if the news is good."
If economists are right, a report on inflation that is expected to be released this morning should help to calm a few nerves.
Due in large part to sagging energy prices, most economists are projecting that the Producer Price Index was unchanged to down slightly in December. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core inflation rate rose by two-tenths of a percentage point, most ecnonomists predict.
"Absent the Middle East, the producer price report would probably make the market do better," Mr. Chandross said.
Activity in the tax-exempt municipal securities market was highlighted by a competitive offering of $320 million worth of general obligation bonds for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
A bid from an investment group led by the First Boston Corporation won the issue, which consists of serial bonds maturing from 1992 to 2011.
The securities were reoffered at yields from 5.30 percent in 1992 to 6.10 percent in 1996, 6.55 percent in 2001, 6.95 percent in 2006 and a maximum 7.05 percent in 2011.
The securities are rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Among the new issues priced in the investment-grade corporate bond market was a $200 million offering of seven-year notes by the Great Atlantic Pacific & Tea Company.
The 9 1/8 percent A.&P. notes, which mature Jan. 15, 1998, are noncallable for life. They were priced at $99.50, to yield 9.224, 1.20 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 7/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
Dillon, Read & Company acted as lead manager for the transaction. The securities are rated A-3 by Moody's and A-minus by Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues improved by about 1/2 point.
Participants in the secondary market for municipal securities said that prices of most widely quoted issues rose by between 1/4 point to 3/8 point.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Dec. 31. The third, broadest measure, M-3, fell by $1.4 billion.
Even with its increase during the last week of the year, M-2, the aggregate followed most closely by the Fed, grew 3.7 percent from the fourth quarter of 1989 to the fourth quarter of 1990, the lowest rate since 1959.
M-2 includes currency in circulation, checking accounts and certain savings accounts.
Some Fed governors have reportedly become increasingly concerned with the slow growth in the money supply. However, yesterday's report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Ford Maintains Dividend, But May Cut Future Payouts

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 10

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company did not cut its dividend this time, but a top company official said it might do so in the future. Amid predictions that it might trim its quarterly payout, the company today declared the regular dividend of 75 cents a share for the first quarter of 1991.
Allan D. Gilmour, Ford's executive vice president in charge of automotive operations, was quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying the nation's No. 2 auto maker might consider lowering the dividend "if the recession is a lot worse than normal." Speaking to reporters at the North American Auto Show in Detroit, Mr. Gilmour said it was "too early to predict what's going to happen to the economy."
 
Bonuses Are Canceled
 Although Ford will maintain its dividend, "it doesn't appear likely at this point" that the company will make profit-sharing payouts to its hourly employees for 1990, Mr. Gilmour said. 
 He also said Ford would not pay executive bonuses for 1990. "We didn't make enough to pay bonuses," he added.
Analysts have suggested that the Big Three auto makers face increasing pressure to cut dividends because of deteriorating sales and dwindling profits.
But "each company hopes that one of its competitors will cut the dividend first and receive the initial bad publicity," said Ronald A. Glantz, an analyst with Dean Witter Securities in San Francisco.
 
Debt Ratings at Risk
 Mr. Glantz added that unless Ford, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation pare their dividends this year, "each faces having its credit rating lowered, which would add hundreds of millions of dollars to their borrowing costs."
The Standard & Poor's Corporation announced on Wednesday that it had placed the Big Three United States car companies on its credit watch list, raising the possibility that the debt ratings of some or all of them might be downgraded.
Chrysler's senior debt is now rated at BBB-, one notch above S.& P.'s speculative category. The senior debt issues of Ford and G.M. are rated at AA-, well above the threshold for investment grade.
Some analysts said the decision today by Ford's board to maintain the 75-cent dividend simply delayed the inevitable, given the uncertain economy and the unhealthy state of the American vehicle market.
 
Big Losses Predicted
 Ford is expected to post an operating loss of as much as $500 million for the fourth quarter.
Analysts expect G.M., the No. 1 auto company, to announce an operating loss of $1.4 billion for last year's fourth quarter, which would be the largest quarterly operating loss in the company's history.
Chrysler, the No. 3 auto maker, is also expected report a loss on operations in the fourth quarter of 1990, Mr. Glantz said. He predicted Chrysler would post a loss of $34 million on its operations during the period.
The auto makers have been hurt by the high costs of paying rebates to attract customers. Ford spent a record $3 billion on buyer incentives and another $1 billion on fleet and leasing incentives in 1990, Mr. Gilmour said.

HEADLINE: In Rare Move, Big Donors Push Energy Efficiency

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
In a rare collaborative undertaking, three of the country's leading philanthropies are establishing an Energy Foundation to promote energy efficiency and greater reliance on renewable sources like wind and solar power.
The foundation is being financed by an initial $20 million from the Rockefeller Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation of Chicago and the Pew Charitable Trusts of Philadelphia. 
 The partnership was conceived long before the Persian Gulf crisis, the sponsors said after announcing the plan yesterday at a news conference in Washington. But they said current events underscored the need for a new energy strategy for political, economic and environmental reasons.
"At a time of grave danger and volatility in the Middle East, it is worrisome that the United States is increasing its dependence on foreign oil, especially so because there are other proven alternatives," said Hal Harvey, an energy engineer who will be executive director of the Energy Foundation.
 
Goals of Foundation
 The foundation, which will have its office in San Francisco, will identify innovations for conserving energy and will seek to promote their use nationwide. It will also provide funds for research and public education and work with government agencies and environmental groups.
Peter C. Goldmark Jr., president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said: "It is time to conceive of energy efficiency as a source of energy just like oil in Alaska or coal in Montana. That's what this foundation is all about. We want to promote an 'efficiency reserve' that is one of the cleanest, safest and cheapest sources of energy we have."
Adele Simmons, president of the MacArthur Foundation, said the sponsors conceived their energy partnership in 1989, convinced that there was growing public support for the concept of energy efficiency. "It was clear to us," she said, "that there are many constituencies ready to move ahead -- the utilities, regulators, environmentalists and policy makers -- and this was so even before the Iraqi developments put energy on the national agenda."
Pew, the country's second largest philanthropy after the Ford Foundation, joined the venture because of its potential to make a difference, said Rebecca W. Rimel, its executive director. "With some effort, we should be able to save between 30 percent and 50 percent of the energy this country now consumes annually. That's what makes this a beautiful program. Regretfully, we do not have the means to do away with poverty, crime or drugs. This is doable."
The foundation will start out by focusing on areas where there is a high potential for energy savings, in fields like electrical utilities, building construction and transportation.
 
Rewards for Efficiency
 For example, it will promote model practices adopted by electrical utilities like Pacific Gas and Electric, which offers cash rebates for customers who switch to more efficient energy equipment, ranging from light bulbs to refrigerators.
In the transportation field, which consumes 27 percent of the country's energy supply each year, the foundation will encourage the use of technologies that could double the fuel efficiency of automobiles in this country.
In the building construction trades, the use of more efficient windows, advanced lighting, heating and cooling systems could reduce energy consumption by 50 percent, said Mr. Harvey.
He said costs of renewable energy sources were significantly reduced in the last decade, making them competitive with fossil fuels. "Wind power produced by California utilities now produces enough electricity to meet the annual needs of 900,000 people," he said.
Welcoming the establishment of the foundation, Dr. John H. Gibbons, director of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, noted that the Federal budget for energy conservation, which he said "should be the centerpiece of any United States strategy to reduce oil dependency," was cut drastically in the early 1980's. Predictably, he said, progress in energy efficiency suffered.
"This new foundation," he added, "has unfettered resources, not tied by ideological in-fighting."

HEADLINE: Florio Needs $800 Million To Balance Budget for '92

BYLINE: By PETER KERR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio's administration acknowledged more bad news today: the state needs to find about $800 million in cuts to balance its budget for the fiscal year beginning in July. Administration officials are asking labor unions to bear half the burden of finding the money.
The administration has told unions representing 64,000 of the state's 87,000 workers that unless they are willing to accept major concessions in salaries and benefits, $400 million in budget cuts involving workers could translate into 10,000 lyoffs, union and administration officials said today. 
 An administration official said that the state expected to lay off several thousand workers but that with union cooperation it could be far less than 10,000. A spokesman for the state's largest union reacted with anger.
The latest news underscored the contrast between the economic and financial outlook for New Jersey in 1991 and Mr. Florio's generally upbeat State of the State address on Tuesday.
Under the slogan "New Jersey Works," Mr. Florio proposed state programs to create tens of thousands of construction jobs, make mortgages available to 3,000 first-time homebuyers, help middle-income parents send their children to college and reduce automobile vehicle inspections that have long irritated the public.
 
Up to 20% Cut
 Vincent Trivelli, legislative coordinator for the Communications Workers of America, the largest of several unions that met with representatives of the administration this week, said the Governor's aides had said that the state had to find $800 million in budget cuts for the fiscal year beginning July 1, and that layoffs and give-backs on the part of state workers would account for $400 million.
An administration official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said estimates for the shortfall in the $12 billion-plus budget for the fiscal year ending in June were holding steady at about $600 million. He said the $800 million for the next fiscal year would require severe cutbacks, including the elimination and merging of some government departments.
Mr. Trivelli said the administration had asked his union, which represents 38,000 employees, to give up 20 percent of their salaries, including a series of salary increases and health benefits granted under a contract signed in January 1990.
"We are not accepting these cutbacks," he said. "They would be a devastating attack not only on the living standards of our members, but for all working people in New Jersey. It will set a pattern that will move into the private sector."
Mr. Florio's hope this week was to create programs with funds from authorities and from the Federal Government to aid, among others, an ailing construction industry and middle-income homeowners and parents.
 
Construction Jobs
 The Governor referred in his State of the State speech to programs that his aides hope will create more than 30,000 construction jobs on transportation and other public works projects. More than $865 million of the money is already drawn rom state and Federal transportation money, officials say, and an additional $200 million would be taken from the state's Transportation Trust Fund, which derives its revenues from a gasoline tax.
In addition, administration officials expect that the New Jersey Turnpike Authority and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey will create tens of thousands more jobs with their construction plans over the next three years. But none of the money from independent authorities and the Transportation Trust Fund could be used to close the gap in the state's budget, which pays the salaries of state employees.
Economists say that such projects could significantly aid the construction industry, which has seen a drop in employment to 152,000 from 181,000 between July 1988 and last fall, according to employment statistics that have not been seasonally adjusted.
 
Vehicle Inspections
 A source of irritation for many New Jerseyans has long been the safety and emissions tests conducted by the Department of Motor Vehicles, which adjusted its hours this year in an economy move to make lines that were often long even longer.
The administration has announced that it plans to eliminate much or all of the safety inspections and turn emmissions testing over to a private contractor in hopes of making the test more efficient and saving the state $22 million. It plans to eliminate testing at 3,900 privately run stations.
The plan would require cars under six years old to be inspected for emissions every other year and would centralize inspections at 30 to 40 franchised locations. Motorists would have to pay between $6 and $15 for inspections, which have been free at state inspection centers. The administration says it plans to have the new system under way by the end of this year.
 
College Savings
 Another program mentioned in Mr. Florio's speech was a $50 million plan to provide loans of up to $5,000 for college tuition, a mearsure aimed at parents with annual household incomes of $60,000 to $90,000 who are not eligible for other loans.
Also aimed at middle-income parents was a $50 million savings bond program for people saving for their children's college educations. The tax-free zero-coupon bonds could be cashed in at maturity. Or they could be used to pay tuition at New Jersey state colleges and universities, where they would be worth 5 percent to 10 percent more than their cash value. The bonds, similar to programs in about 20 other states, would be floated by a variety of independent state authorities.

HEADLINE: Paine Webber Expects A Loss of $95 Million

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Yet another Wall Street firm gave out some grim numbers yesterday. The Paine Webber Group Inc. announced that it would have a quarterly after-tax loss of about $95 million because of the cost of hundreds of dismissals as well as for new reserves against risky investments.
Executives with the firm said Paine Webber had dismissed about 400 people in the fourth quarter, including about 250 professionals. Those dismissals included 30 investment bankers who were let go late in the year. 
 In a statement describing its financial actions, Paine Webber said it would take a one-time restructuring charge of $24 million to pay for the changes. That money will be used to pay for severance, as well as to consolidate office space. Some branches will be discontinued.
 
Reserves Increased
 The firm also said it would add $71 million to its reserves against its merchant banking investments, many of which plunged in value after the collapse of the "junk bond" market. The new amounts will triple that fund.
Paine Webber's merchant banking problems involve bridge loans that cannot be repaid, including a loan made for the Campeau Corporation's acquisition of Federated Department Stores, which filed for bankruptcy protection shortly after the deal was completed.
In the deal-making days of the 1980's, investment banks provided such loans to corporate acquirers, charging large amounts for the short-term extension of credit. The firms expected that the merged companies would dip into the junk bond markets to raise capital to repay the loans. But the collapse of the market left the companies unable to make good on the loans, choking the capital base of a number of Wall Street firms.
The firm said that before the charges it expected to break even in its operating results for the fourth quarter. With the charges, it anticipated a loss of $95 million for the quarter, and a loss of $55 million for the year.
 
$50 Million Savings Seen
 Donald Marron, Paine Webber's chairman, said the firm expected to reduce its costs by about $50 million annually, primarily because of the dismissals. He also said the firm had increased its capital base to $1.56 billion for 1990, compared with $1.52 billion in 1989.
"Clearly, the economic climate is not very good," Mr. Marron said. "We thought it was prudent to increase our reserves based on the 1990 climate and the 1991 climate. We are adjusting the size of the staff to the new environment."
By taking the charges, Paine Webber joins a number of other firms that have undertaken costly reorganizations since 1989. In December, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it expected to have a $250 million loss for the year as a result of a major realignment of its businesses. That included the dismissal of hundreds of people.
In addition, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a subsidiary of the American Express Company, had a $915 million loss in one quarter of 1990 because of costs associated with its reorganization. And Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's largest brokerage, took a charge against earnings of $470 million late in 1989 to pay for its restructuring.

HEADLINE: Overseers Silence Bridgeport's Talk of Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Jan. 10

 BODY:
When Mayor Mary C. Moran said this week that she was considering declaring Bridgeport bankrupt, something that has never been done by a city its size, state officials were stunned, credit markets were shaken and residents were talking about it everywhere.
But today, state monitors stepped in and said, in effect, that they would have none of this talk of bankruptcy in Connecticut's largest city. They barred it from considering such an option and voted to impose their own plan to balance the city's budget. 
 Mayor Moran had suggested that declaring bankruptcy might offer a kind of shock treatment to the city, sparing homeowners from further tax increases and reopening expensive union contracts.
Today, the State Treasurer, Francisco L.Borges, who is chairman of the state board overseeing the city's finances, insisted to the Mayor's face that she "unequivocally" recant her statements.
"The words you used -- 'explore' and 'option' -- mean an awful lot to the marketplace," Mr. Borges told the Mayor at a meeting between the city and the panel, the Bridgeport Financial Review Board.
The Mayor, however, bluntly refused. In an irate tone she explained that "as the C.E.O. of this city, it's incumbent upon me toexplore every single avenue, and I will not apologize for that."
The state board countered that under the law only it could approve a municipal bankruptcy proceeding -- a claim the Mayor said she may challenge -- and it passed a resolution never to give such a sanction.
"Bankruptcy is inappropriate because the city has cash, and it's up to date on its obligations," Mr. Borges said after the meeting. "The city's problems are management-driven."
The board also rejected Bridgeport's plan for closing a $7.5 million budget gap. Instead, the board decided that its staff members would come up with a plan and that the board would vote on it next week. The city proposal would have left a $3 million shortfall in its $290 million budget. It also faces a projected shortfall of up to $22 million in the fiscal year that begins July 1. Mr. Borges also announced that he was withdrawing the city from the state's clean-water assistance fund, which relies on revenue bonds. He said he could not be certain that Bridgeport would be able to pay back its loans.
Bridgeport's financial problems did not surface overnight. State officials say years of mismanagement, lax tax collection and overly generous union contracts helped bring this industrial city of 135,000 people to such a stage.
But the recession has dealt a blow to hopes that Connecticut's boom of the 1980's would lift Bridgeport back to the health it had in the postwar years.
"What has tipped it is the change in the economy and the drop in property-tax revenues," said Donald A. Kirshbaum, the executive director of the financial review board.
 
600 Already Laid Off
 Bridgeport averted a brush with bankruptcy in 1987 when it sold state-backed bonds to cover a $60 million deficit. In return, the state assumed oversight of all fiscal matters.
In the year since Mayor Moran took office, 600 city employees have been laid off, including about 100 teachers and 500 workers at a city-owned nursing home that was sold recently. The layoffs cut the city work force to 3,600.
While Mayor Moran's search for high-level managers beyond the city's borders was an encouraging sign to the state monitors, management problems persist, they say.
"Most of the top people around the Mayor have only been there one year," Mr. Kirshbaum said, "so there's not enough institutional memory."
 
While Its Neighbors Flourished
 The city acknowledges doing a poor job collecting revenues. And property taxes, the largest source of revenue, have not kept pace with expenses. While other towns and cities in Fairfield County saw their tax bases expand tremendously in the 1980's as corporations moved in and housing values soared, little development came to Bridgeport, and the value of its taxable property grew only 10 percent from 1983 to 1988.
In addition, state officials say that Bridgeport has agreed to union contracts that are too expensive; one gave workers a 32-hour workweek. "Bridgeport has a history of not negotiating its contracts well and giving away management rights," Mr. Kirshbaum said.
One outcome of a bankruptcy declaration could be the dissolution of the city's 14 union contracts, which account for 60 percent of the budget. This week, Mayor Moran, a former real-estate agent who had no political experience before running for mayor as a Republican, told The Bridgeport Post that declaring bankruptcy would provide an opportunity to "present a plan on what you'll do with contracts."
The city's unions reacted angrily. "It would not be in our members' interest or in the citizens' interest," said Wayne A. Gilbert of the National Association of Government Employees in Bridgeport, which represents 650 workers, mostly in clerical and custodial jobs.
 
Would Be a First
 If Bridgeport were to declare bankruptcy, it would be the first large city in the United States to do so, bankruptcy experts say. School districts, water districts and several small towns have filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 9 of the Federal bankruptcy law, which was established in the Depression for municipalities.
Chapter 9 enables a municipality to delay paying its debts while it arranges a payment schedule with creditors. It does not allow a city's assets to be sold to pay creditors, nor does it remove city officials' governing powers.
Credit-rating officials hurried to review the city's rating this week. Moody's, for instance, decided to keep Bridgeport's rating of BAA after being assured by city officials that a bankruptcy declaration was not imminent. The city's rating was downgraded two months ago to BAA from BAA1. An A rating is average.
In coffee shops and on street corners, Bridgeport residents fretted over their city's future this week, and most appeared to reject the notion that bankruptcy would make things better.
"I wouldn't like to see bankruptcy because too many innocent people will get hurt," said Frank Marsillio, a retired carpenter sitting at the counter at the New Colony Diner.
Dwight Walker, the owner of New York Express, a clothing store in a half-vacant shopping arcade on Main Street, worried about what bankruptcy would do to Bridgeport's image. "How are you going to get people to want to come here?" he said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Legislators Take Sides for Combat Or for Reliance on the Sanctions

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Congress today began debating the prospect of war in the Persian Gulf, arguing whether an early attack on Iraq or continued reliance on economic sanctions was more likely to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
A strong sense of history permeated the day's proceedings. The proposal backed by President Bush and the one thought most likely to pass, the "Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution" was described by a pivotal sponsor, Representative Dante B. Fascell, Democratic of Florida, as the "practical equivalent" of a declaration of war, a step the Congress has taken formally only five times. 
 In the Senate, Paul D. Wellstone, a freshman Democrat from Minnesota, said he had hoped his first Senate speech would be about children, education and health care, but instead it was about war.
"This cause is not worth fighting for right now," he said. "We must stay the course with economic sanctions, continue the squeeze, continue the pressure, move forward on the diplomatic front, and, Mr. President, we must not, we must not rush to war." [Sampling from speeches, page A8.]
But Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, said he had recently changed his mind and decided to support President Bush's use of force because "it is clear to me that sanctions alone cannot succeed. They will inflict difficulties on civilians, but sanctions alone will not force Iraq out of Kuwait."
In the House, Mr. Fascell, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, was joined by two other Democratic committee chairmen and the Republican leadership in backing the proposal that would specifically authorize President Bush to use military force against Iraq if it has not withdrawn from Kuwait by Jan. 15. Representative Stephen J. Solarz, Democrat of Brooklyn, a key drafter, argued that the resolution took pains to maintain Congressional prerogatives and would show Iraq that the United States was united.
 
Sanctions Are Backed
 But Democratic leaders there and in the Senate advanced counterproposals, urging instead continued reliance on economic sanctions. Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, said, "If we go to war now, no one will ever know if sanctions would have worked if given a full and fair chance." Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader, said "the tough measures we have already taken have stopped the Iraqi war machine dead in its tracks."
Republicans countered with a new letter from the Director of Central Intelligence, William H. Webster, saying the power of Iraq's ground forces was "unlikely to be substantially affected" by sanctions over the next 6 to 12 months. He also said there was little evidence that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq faced political difficulties because of shortages.
Throughout the debate, lawmakers spoke of the votes they expected to cast Saturday as the most important of their careers. But in neither the House nor the Senate today were the issues often clearly joined face to face. In the Senate, even though the gulf crisis was taken up well before noon, there were rarely more than a handful of Senators present, although this was more than the usual number of Senators on most days and there were fewer interruptions for quorum calls while speakers were sought.
 
More Than Usual Present
 In the House, competing news conferences were the early forums of choice until the Rules Committee met in midafternoon and proposed an extraordinary amount of time, 15 hours, for floor consideration of the issue. And as the House for an hour considered adopting those procedures, there were typically about 40 of the House's 435 members present, again well more than the usual number.
The House had three resolutions before it, one favoring sanctions, one authorizing President Bush to use of force and a third merely asserting the exclusivity of the Congressional power to declare war. The Senate had a pro-sanctions resolution on the floor, and it was expected that a contrary proposal backing force would be introduced.
Despite the clear differences between most Republicans and most Democrats on the war versus sanctions issue, some leaders in both parties sought to blunt any partisan edge. Mr. Gephardt, opening the formal debate in the House in late afternoon, said, "In this vote, we are not Democrats. We are not Republicans. We are Americans."
 
No Lining Up of Votes
 He said there would be no Democratic whips trying to line up votes for the sanctions proposals he supported. "We expect and want all of the members to vote their conscience, what in their mind is the right thing for this country to do."
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the minority leader, praised that commitment, and said he, too, would support whatever result the House settled on.
He went on to call for military action, saying, "Saddam Hussein has more tanks, planes and men under arms than Hitler did when Chamberlain came back saying 'peace in our time.' Either we stop him now and stop him permanently or we won't stop him at all." He said those advocating further reliance on sanctions amounted to "a brass choir of doubt and confusion."
The resolution that he, Mr. Fascell, Mr. Solarz and others from both parties settled on this morning, the provision that most House leaders predicted would be adopted on Saturday, would authorize the President "to use United States Armed Forces pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678." That resolution, adopted Nov. 29, authorized members nations to use "all necessary means" to get Iraqi forces out of Kuwait if they were not withdrawn by Jan. 15.
 
One Condition Sought
 The only condition of the Congressional resolution was to require the President first to notify Congress that diplomatic efforts and economic sanctions "have not been and would not be successful in obtaining such compliance."
A comparable measure was expected to be introduced in the Senate after Republican leaders there conferred at the White House and then met in a caucus this afternoon.
The alternatives introduced in the House and the Senate were very similar in language and identical in intended effect.
They declared Congressional insistence on an end to Iraq's "brutal and illegal occupation of Kuwait." They said military force was appropriate to protect American forces, enforce the embargo and defend Saudia Arabia. Each declared that continued economic and diplomatic sanctions were appropriate now, and promised to consider with expedited procedures any future request from President Bush for a declaration of war or other authorization of military action.
 
2d House Resolution
 Finally, the House is also considering another brief resolution declaring "The Congress finds that the Constitution of the United States vests all power to declare war in the Congress of the United States. Any offensive action taken against Iraq must be explicitly approved by the Congress of the United States before such action may be initiated." It is expected to pass.
The resolution introduced by Mr. Solarz was frequently faulted as amounting to "an unlimited blank check to initiate war," as Mr. Mitchell put it. But Republicans insisted that the time was now ripe for action.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, contended that the President had "taken every step short of the use of force" and that now it was time for the Senate to join in his support.
In the House, Representative John Miller, Republican of Washington, said proposals to rely on sanctions for another year would be translated by the Iraqis to mean "you've got another year to pillage and rape, another year to threaten other nations."
 
How to Go About It
 But Senator Sam Nunn, Democrat of Georgia and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the issue was "not whether we agree with President Bush's goals. We do. The real question is how we go about it, whether we actually use military force or whether we use the embargo. In either event, the Iraqis must get out of Kuwait."
Mr. Webster's letter, sent today to the House Armed Services Committee, stated that although Iraqi ground forces could weather the embargo largely unscathed, Iraq's air force and ground-based air defenses would suffer far more from the embargo. But Mr. Webster suggested that air power "is not likely to play a major role in any battle for Kuwait."
That conclusion was quickly contested by Democratic Congressional experts on the sanctions, who said that any military action against Iraq almost certainly would begin with a prolonged air bombardment of military targets in Kuwait and Iraq, not with a ground attack.
"Isn't it fair to say that if Iraq's air defenses go down in a significant way, that fewer American pilots will be killed if we wait to begin a war?" a Senate aide said.
 Many lawmakers complained that other nations, some especially menaced by Iraq, were not doing their part. Senator David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, said, "I cannot in good conscience vote to initiate full-scale war now to restore the Government of Kuwait if 90 percent of the risk and burden will be borne by America while other nations like Japan and Germany sit on the sidelines not doing their share."
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, also questioned why the United States was particularly concerned about defending the Kuwaitis. Recalling his years as United States chief delegate to the United Nations, he said, "I remember the Kuwaitis as a particularly poisonous adversary of the U.S., and their anti-Semitic attitude was at the level of being personally loathsome."

HEADLINE: Weicker and the Assembly: New Lines of Power

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Jan. 10

 BODY:
When Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. stepped into the House chamber on Wednesday to deliver his State of the State speech, not a single member of his own party was there to gaze up at the rostrum and applaud on cue. Mr. Weicker, representing the independent Connecticut Party, stood alone at last against the sea of Democrats and Republicans and the two-party system that he railed against in last year's election.
The moment drove home what was largely an abstraction until then: The General Assembly, as the legislature is known, has become as independent as Mr. Weicker. Released from the bonds of party loyalty that have tied its members to past governors, the state's 187 legislators will have to redefine their institution's role in the new political order, just as Mr. Weicker is reshaping the old patterns of the executive branch. 
 Many people think the process will be difficult. The House and Senate have held over the years to the traditions of a strong chief executive expected to lead, matched against a legislature that dots the i's and crosses the t's.
"The governor proposes; the Assembly disposes" is repeated like an article of faith in a building where Gov. William A. O'Neill, the Democrat who preceded Mr. Weicker, governed for 10 years without having a veto overridden. The question is: How much of that tradition can or should hold with a governor who cannot call on even one member of his own party for support, advice or consent? Should the General Assembly still follow, obediently or obstinately, as in the familiar days of Mr. O'Neill and his predecessors, or stake out a new independent leadership course of its own?
Looming over the government is a huge and still growing gap in the state budget. Budget officers now predict that Connecticut will fall $2.2 billion short in revenue over the next 18 months, in an annual budget of just over $7 billion. Both of the state's largest revenue sources -- the corporate profits tax and the sales tax -- have shrunk in the regional economic recession.
 
'Legislative Proposing'
 Some lawmakers think that re-examining the old assumptions about government and party politics will help resolve the crisis, while others fear that it could heighten the potential for chaos. More than a few see long-term opportunity: whichever group or subgroup in the legislature succeeds in getting the Governor's ear will have power, no matter the party labels. At the least, a new assertiveness is anticipated.
"Ultimately, I think we'll see a rapid expansion of legislative proposing," said Representative Jonathan Pelto, a Democrat from Storrs and deputy majority leader in the House. "But's it's something that will take time for us to get used to."
In his State of the State speech on Wednesday, Mr. Weicker encouraged lawmakers to abandon their old assumptions, forget the rules of partisanship and look anew at how government should and should not work. "The state's political clothes are worn out, and it is up to all of us to cut a new suit for these times," Mr. Weicker said. "People are sick of partisan games and want results, not scorecards."
But the early rumblings show ambivalence about what direction the Assembly may take. The Speaker of the House, Richard J. Balducci, a Democrat from Newington, announced last week that his party, which is in the majority, would formulate its own budget proposals in coming weeks with elements that might parallel Mr. Weicker's budget package but might not.
 
Old Tie
 But conforming with tradition, Mr. Balducci said the Democrats had no plans at present to submit a formal budget bill until Mr. Weicker makes his budget address next month.
The Republicans have called for a budget meeting between Mr. Weicker and legislative leaders in both parties, but House and Senate minority leaders also clearly have their own agenda. Mr. Weicker, who served in the United States Senate for 18 years until 1988, was a liberal Republican throughout his career until last year, and some think the old ties may still bind.
Democrats outnumber Republicans by 89 to 62 in the House and by 20 to 16 in the Senate.
"The shackles of partisan politics are now shaken," said the House minority leader, Edward C. Krawiecki Jr., a Republican from Bristol. "This is a new opportunity for Republicans."
Mr. Weicker's own signals shed only limited light on how involved he wants the General Assembly to be in proposing legislation. Today at a news conference in his office, for example, he said he had no intention of having his budget plans come out in "snippets and bits and pieces," and that he wanted to present the budget to legislators on Feb. 20 as "a whole package."
But moments later he repeated the pledge he made on Wednesday that his door would be open to any and all lawmakers and that legislative leaders would not only be informed of budget plans in advance of the February announcement but also be fully consulted along the way.
Some legislators say that even without Mr. Weicker's independent administration and even without a budget crisis, the General Assembly was heading toward greater independence.
In the last few years, for example, the Senate President Pro Tempore, John B. Larson, a Democrat from East Hartford, developed and proposed a series of bills dealing with parents and children, including a law that took effect last year giving parents the right to take time off from their jobs for a child's birth or illness. Such initiatives had been rare.
"Times of great problems are times of great opportunities," said Representative Richard T. Mulready, a Democrat from West Hartford and co-chairman of the legislature's Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Saudi Contributions in Crisis Are Called Generous

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia has spent every penny it earned from windfall profits from oil sales last year and has committed double that amount to defend itself from Iraq and support those who have come to its aid, diplomats and Saudi officials say.
In interviews this week, Saudi businessmen and officials and Western diplomats said that Saudi Arabia had earned roughly $15 billion in windfall oil profits in the first five months of the crisis last year, and had made $30 billion in gulf-related commitments, only $15 billion of which it had spent. Thus, they said, the kingdom had effectively mortgaged a large part of whatever oil profits it might earn in 1991. 
 Saudi Arabia's budget deficit for 1990, they said, probably totaled at least $15 billion owing to the gulf crisis, roughly double the shortfall anticipated before Iraq's invasion in August.
The Saudis and diplomats who provided the estimates said they were doing so partly in response to critics in the United States Congress who argued that Riyadh had not given as much as it should have to the American-led effort to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
 
'Taking a Definite Risk'
 "I think Saudi Arabia's contribution to this effort has not fully been understood or appreciated," said Saleh al-Malek, a former Deputy Minister of Municipal and Rural Affairs who now heads a social research consulting agency.
Western diplomats here estimated the shortfall at $15 billion. Most agreed that Saudi Arabia had committed more than the diplomats had expected.
"They are taking a definite risk," one economist said, "because their ability to pay for what they've committed assumes that no major new commitments will be necessary -- unlikely if there is a war -- and that oil prices will stay high enough to enable them to pay for what they have already pledged."
Saudi and Western officials estimated that because of a large increase in Saudi oil production and rising market prices, the Saudis' net oil revenues for 1990 totaled about $40 billion, about $15 billion more than the Government had projected before the crisis began.
 
Produced More Oil and Aid
 Prince Abdelaziz bin Salman bin Abdelaziz, a senior adviser in the Ministry of Petroleum, said: "We have contributed enormously in two respects -- by increasing production to lower prices, and by supporting those countries that sent forces here. Just imagine how much more we could have earned had we limited oil production to seven million barrels per day."
The largest single commitment was $13.6 billion in new arms and equipment for the Saudi armed forces. Almost $3 billion to military support for the United States and other "friendly" countries, $1.7 billion in extra mobilization and deployment costs, and $1 billion for civil defense brought the unofficial estimate of total Saudi defense commitments to more than $19 billion.
The Saudis are reported to have made more than $6 billion in grants and Government-guaranteed loans to friendly governments to offset the cost of the economic effects of the crisis.
"In relative terms, these figures are even more striking," a Western economist said. In 1990, he said, crisis-related costs led to 25 to 30 percent of the Kingdom's total spending, or 15 to 20 percent of its gross domestic product. He said United States spending was $9 billion at most, no more than 1 percent of annual spending and less than one-fifth of 1 percent of its gross domestic product.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
ARABS SAY IRAQ PLANS OFFER LINKING PULLOUT TO ISRAEL; CONGRESS OPENS WAR DEBATE

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Arab diplomats here said today that they had been told that President Saddam Hussein plans an initiative soon after the Jan. 15 United Nations deadline for giving up Kuwait that will express his support "in principle" for pulling out of Kuwait and simultaneously call for an international conference to address Palestinian grievances against Israel.
The Iraqi leader, those diplomats said, is expected to wait until a day or two after the United Nations deadline has passed to make his statement to demonstrate he has not been intimidated. He is also expected to seek international guarantees that Iraq will not be attacked, and to propose negotiations on disputes between Iraq and Kuwait.
 
Previous Hints
 While he has previously hinted that he might respond in some fashion to a linking of the two issues, Mr. Hussein has never said he will leave Kuwait. 
 Reports of the planned Iraqi initiative also suggest that President Hussein is unlikely to make substantive concessions to Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar during his 11th-hour mediation trip to Baghdad.
The Secretary General left New York for Baghdad tonight via Paris and Geneva. He is scheduled to meet in Geneva on Friday with the 12 foreign ministers of the European Community and with the Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia, which is currently chairman of the movement of nonaligned states. [Page A10.]
 
Five Days to Go
 With only five days left before the Jan. 15 deadline, Arab and European governments have become involved in seeing whether a formula can be found to settle the Kuwait crisis peacefully. In Geneva on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq called for an "Arab solution" to the crisis but was unspecific on what Iraq might do. Mr. Aziz and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d failed to make progress at a meeting in Geneva.
It was impossible to confirm that Mr. Hussein will make the kind of statement that the Arab diplomats at the United Nations say they have been told about. Those diplomats, from Arab countries aligned with the Saudis and Americans against Iraq, said they had received reports of such an impending Iraqi initiative from Algeria, Jordan and Yemen, the three Arab countries closest to Baghdad.
The diplomats said they had no doubt that the Bush Administration would reject such an Iraqi proposal because of the linkage between the Kuwait withdrawal and the Palestinian question and because there would be no guaranteed deadline for an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait.
But the diplomats said the expected move could strengthen the hand of those in Congress and elsewhere who want to give economic sanctions more time to force Iraq out of Kuwait.
They also argued that the negotiations Iraq offers on unresolved issues with Kuwait -- like ownership of the Rumaila oil field and the islands of Bubiyan and Warba -- could drag on almost indefinitely, leaving Baghdad still in control of Kuwait.
 
'A Nightmare Scenario'
 Meanwhile President Hussein could reinforce his position as a hero to the Arab masses by asserting that he had effectively linked the surrender of Kuwait with new steps to settle the Palestinian issue and force Israel to give up the Arab territories it occupied after the 1967 war.
"Frankly, it's a nightmare scenario," an Arab diplomat said.
Mr. Perez de Cuellar's scheduled arrival on Saturday in Baghdad will follow a visit by President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, who was reported there today on a similar peace mission. Mr. Kaunda obtained the release of a British nurse imprisoned by Iraq last year in a purported espionage plot for which an Iranian-born British journalist was hanged.
Diplomats stressed that the Secretary General would have almost no margin for negotiation when he meets the Iraqi leadership because he is bound by the resolutions of the Security Council, which demand Iraq's unconditional surrender of Kuwait.
 
Pullout Arrangements
 The more optimistic diplomats here said they hoped that the Iraqi leader might find it easier to make concessions to the Secretary General of the United Nations than directly to the United States. But most argue that the Secretary General can do little more than explain once again to the Iraqi leader the options he faces.
"The Secretary General must paint a plain, unvarnished picture of exactly what is possible and what is not," Britain's United Nations representative, Sir David Hannay, told reporters tonight.
Sir David said the Secretary General can tell Mr. Hussein that the Security Council is ready to guarantee that he will not be attacked, and to offer its full support for a negotiated settlement of his disagreements with Kuwait, but only if he immediately starts pulling out his forces.
The Secretary General is also ready to talk about technical arrangements for an Iraqi pullout, including the dispatch of a United Nations peacekeeping force to oversee the withdrawal and preserve calm along the Iraq-Kuwait frontier afterward.
 
Promise of Nordic Troops
 Earlier this week the five Nordic countries, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland, told the Secretary General that they were ready to contribute troops to such a force if the Security Council asks them to do so and urged him to start contingency planning for an Iraqi withdrawal.
The Secretary General is expected to return to New York on Sunday and report on his mission to the Security Council next Monday, one day before it has authorized the use of force to expel Iraq from Kuwait.

HEADLINE: Steel Output Is Off by 1.8%

DATELINE: GENEVA, Jan. 10 (Reuters)

 BODY:
World crude steel production fell by 1.8 percent, to 769.4 million tons, in 1990, mainly because of reduced output in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe said today.
The Soviet Union was the top world producer with 155.8 million tons, but its output was 4.3 million tons less than in 1989. The combined output of Eastern Europe totaled 50.3 million tons, a drop of 14.7 percent.
Output of the 12-nation European Community fell by 2.1 percent, to 137.3 million tons. Production in the United States rose slightly, to 88.7 million tons, third highest. Japan was the No. 2 producer with 110.3 million tons, up 2.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Salomon Brothers May Move 700 Jobs Out of New York City

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Joining the corporate concern about the cost of doing business in New York City, Salomon Brothers Inc., the large Wall Street investment house, is considering moving hundreds of jobs out of the city, executives with the firm and city officials said yesterday.
The executives said the firm was negotiating to move 700 jobs in its operations division to sites in Tampa, Fla., and Columbus, Ohio. Although keeping the jobs in New York has not been ruled out, they said Salomon was leaning toward a move to Tampa. A final decision is not expected for 60 days. 
 No employees would be moved until after the end of the year, the executives said. Salomon is said to be planning to keep 3,000 employees in New York.
The disclosure of the negotiations came a day after W. R. Grace & Company, whose ties to New York go back a century, announced it would move most of its staff from Manhattan to Boca Raton, Fla. The move was made for economic reasons.
"We obviously can't be happy that they are considering moving personel out of the city," said Jeanne Nathan, a spokeswoman for Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development. "But we are glad that they are keeping their headquarters in the World Trade Center and that they will continue to have a very major stake in New York City."
While the Salomon negotiations involve only workers in the operations division, known in Wall Street parlance as the back office, such a move could have a large impact on employment in the city. The back office is a labor-intensive part of any Wall Street firm. Through the back offices, millions of securities trades are cleared each day, meaning that securities are moved to the account that purchased them and cash is moved to the seller.
In recent years, city officials have been working to provide spaces for back offices to move to, but some firms have moved their operations from Manhattan. Some have moved out of Manhattan to less expensive boroughs, while others have left New York State.

HEADLINE: Rich Got Richer in 80's; Others Held Even

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
The wealth of affluent people grew substantially in the 1980's while the assets of other Americans barely kept pace with inflation, the Census Bureau reported today.
The Government and private economists have been reporting for several years that the nation's income distribution was becoming more unequal, with a bigger gap between people of high and low incomes. Today's report was one of the first systematic examinations of wealth, reflecting not just one year's income but the lifetime accumulation of property and other assets. 
 The Census Bureau said that for the most affluent fifth of all households, wealth rose 14 percent from 1984 to 1988, after adjusting for inflation. For other households, wealth was not significantly different in 1984 and 1988, the bureau said.
In 1988 the United States had 91.6 million households. The top fifth consisted of 18.3 million households with income of more than $46,600 a year; the median wealth of those households was $111,770. In any group, the number of households above the median is the same as the number below it.
Wealth, or net worth, is defined by the Census Bureau as the value of savings and checking accounts, real estate, automobiles, stocks and bonds and other assets, minus debts. The value of pension plans, jewelry and home furnishings was not included. The Census Bureau report is based on interviews with 24,000 households chosen to be representative of the nation's 92 million,
White households typically have 10 times as much wealth as black households, the Census Bureau reported. The difference between the races was about the same in 1988 as in 1984, the only other year in which the bureau collected comprehensive data on wealth.
Judith H. Eargle, an economist at the Census Bureau, said that as expected, the latest study showed that wealth increased with a person's income, age and education.
While the median income of whites is roughly twice that of blacks, the disparity in wealth is much greater, partly because wealth reflects decades of differences in earnings, investment and the inheritance of property. The data in the report suggest why economic disparities between blacks and whites are likely to endure even if blacks' incomes catch up with whites': People with similar incomes may have very different levels of wealth.
The median wealth of all households in 1988 was $35,750, the bureau said. The median was $43,280 for whites, $4,170 for blacks and $5,520 for Hispanic households. The Hispanic category may overlap with the other two, since Hispanic people may be of any race.
Elderly couples often have lower incomes than younger couples. But the median wealth of elderly married people, $124,420, is about 10 times that of couples in which the head of household is under 35 years old, the bureau said.
The Government has much more information about income than about wealth. Many people do not know the total value of their assets, and many regard detailed questions about their wealth as intrusive. But wealth, Ms. Eargle said, "may be just as important as income as a measure of a person's economic well-being."
Robert B. Avery, an economist who used to supervise surveys of consumer finances for the Federal Reserve Board, said the increased wealth of the top 20 percent of the population was "a little bit surprising" because the board found "no change in real household wealth," after adjustment for inflation, from 1983 to 1986. In those years, "we saw no demonstrable evidence that the rich were getting richer," said Mr. Avery, now a professor of consumer economics at Cornell University.
In the Census Bureau survey, 29 percent of black households reported that they had no wealth, meaning that they owned no assets or that their liabilities exceeded their assets. By contrast, 9 percent of all white households and 24 percent of Hispanic households reported having no wealth.
At the other end of the scale, 29 percent of white households reported wealth of $100,000 or more, as against 5 percent of black households and 12 percent of Hispanic households.
About two-thirds of all families own their homes. But the equity value of such homes declined from 1984 to 1988, suggesting that mortgage debt went up or the homes' market value went down after adjusting for inflation. The median equity was $43,070 in 1988, as against $46,110 in 1984.
 
More Have Stocks and I.R.A.'s
 Mr. Avery said the bureau's survey of 24,000 households gave a reliable picture of the population in general but was "not good in measuring the very top of the wealth distribution because there is no particular effort to sample high-income people." Surveys by the Federal Reserve Board suggest that 1 percent of all households hold one-third of all personal wealth, he said.
Predictably, the Census Bureau found that married couples were much wealthier than households headed by men or women with no spouse present. Married couples had median wealth of $57,130 in 1988.
But somewhat surprisingly, the bureau found that the median for households headed by women, $13,570, was higher than for households headed by men with no wife present, $13,050.
Ms. Eargle of the Census Bureau observed that many women heading households were elderly and were able to accumulate wealth over a longer period of time than the single men heading households, who tend to be younger. "These elderly female householders include widows, a portion of whose wealth has been inherited," she said.
The Census Bureau said in 1986 that it intended to publish studies of household wealth every year or two. But the tabulation and analysis of data have taken longer than expected. Ms. Eargle said the agency still wanted to issue such studies every two or three years.
The report said 22 percent of American households owned stocks or mutual fund shares in 1988, up from 20 percent in 1984. In 24 percent of households, people had individual retirement accounts or Keogh plans, up from 20 percent in 1984.
Ms. Eargle, the author of the report, said the difference in the wealth of blacks and whites might be explained partly by marital status: only 35 percent of black households included married couples, as against 60 percent of white households and 55 percent of Hispanic households.
The racial disparity is smaller among married couples than among all households. The median wealth of married white couples, $62,390, is three and a half times the median for married black couples, $17,640.

 BODY:
L. William Seidman, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said today that he will try to assess how well the F.D.I.C. is running three failed New England banks when he visits Boston on Friday.
Mr. Seidman was also scheduled to meet with the governors of the six New England states. 
 The visit comes less than a week after the F.D.I.C. seized three banking units of the Bank of New England Corporation.
The F.D.I.C. took over the banks on Sunday, injecting about $750 million in capital. The Government is seeking bidders for the banks, which are in Massachusetts, Maine and Connecticut.
Mr. Seidman said the main purpose for his visit was to meet with F.D.I.C. officials and bank personnel.
"In particular, I hope to meet with many of the hundreds of bank employees and thank them for their efforts and support during this difficult period," Mr. Seidman said.
As for his meeting with the governors, Mr. Seidman said, "These officials expressed an interest in sharing their first-hand impressions of general economic and industry conditions in New England."

HEADLINE: Rohatyn Agrees To Retain Post On Fiscal Panel

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 10

 BODY:
While Felix G. Rohatyn won't be staying in his post as head of New York City's fiscal watchdog agency for very long, he won't be leaving right away either.
Mr. Rohatyn, the investment banker who helped New York steer its way through its fiscal crisis in the mid-1970's but who has quarreled with city and labor officials over how to cope with the present turmoil, said he would remain as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation "for a limited period of time," according to an announcement issued today by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
 That means that the 62-year-old Mr. Rohatyn, who said last fall after a public spat with union leaders that he would resign his post by the end of 1990, will remain during critical negotiations in the next few months over both New York State's and New York City's budgets. The news did not generate much surprise today among state or city officials, who seem to have expected that Mr. Rohatyn would allow himself to be coaxed into staying on as the action unfolded.
 
'Doesn't Always Agree With Him'
 "His experience and judgment are especially valuable as we cope with the effects of the recession that is burdening the nation's state and local governments," the Governor said.
Calls to Mr. Rohatyn this afternoon and evening were not returned.
Mayor David N. Dinkins, who often lists Mr. Rohatyn as one of his most valued advisers but who politely ignored his suggestions that the contracts he was negotiating with teachers and other unions were excessive, said through a spokesman that despite their differences over the contracts, he had no desire to hasten Mr. Rohatyn's departure.
"The Mayor seeks his counsel all the time," said Mr. Dinkins's press secretary, Albert Scardino. "He doesn't always agree with him, because Felix, necessarily, has a focus that is far narrower than what the Mayor has to consider."
 
Possible Struggle Avoided
 Still, in retaining Mr. Rohatyn, whose assessment of the city's budget difficulties seems to mirror his own in many respects, Mr. Cuomo clearly has avoided the prospect of having to carry out a struggle right now with the Mayor over a successor to Mr. Rohatyn. The final choice is up to the Governor, but city officials would be expected to have a hand in the decision.
Last month, the Governor warned that the city's finances were out of control and might need to be taken over by a state control board. Both he and Mr. Dinkins have since then taken pains to play down that rift, saying they were more interested in working together to avoid the need for a takeover.
The Municipal Assistance Corporation, created by state legislation in 1975 to issue bonds on behalf of a nearly bankrupt New York City, is not expected to play the same critical role in solving the city's financial problems now that it did in the 1970's, largely because the immediate constraints on the city are of a different nature.

HEADLINE: New York Dismisses Official Who Attacked Bridge Cuts

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
New York City's Deputy Commissioner for Bridges, who spoke out publicly against cutbacks in bridge maintenance, warning that they would endanger public safety, was dismissed last night.
Transportation Commissioner Lucius J. Riccio said in a statement that he had dismissed the Deputy Commissioner, David Steinberger, because the two had differences of opinion over how the Bridge Bureau should be managed. 
 "At this time I believe a change is necessary," Mr. Riccio said. He said he would not make any other comment.
Mr. Steinberger's dismissal comes justtwo days after an article in The New York Times reported that Mr. Riccio had reopened the south side of the Manhattan Bridge to subway trains last year despite warnings from Mr. Steinberger that the deteriorating bridge would suffer serious structural damage and that subway service would have to be suspended repeatedly for repairs to the bridge.
 
'Bad Decision for the Bridge'
 In a memo to Mr. Riccio dated Aug. 17, Mr. Steinberger said returning trains to the bridge was a "bad decision for the bridge" and he urged Mr. Riccio to reconsider it. The Manhattan Bridge is one of the city's most deteriorated bridges. Stateinspectors have discovered more than 300 hazardous conditions on the bridge, including large cracks and corroded steel beams.
But Mr. Riccio reopened the subway tracks in September, and the city was forced to stop service on Dec. 27 after inspectors found that a beam supporting the subway tracks was an inch away from failure. City engineers and officials of the Transit Authority have said that if the the beam had slipped, the subway tracks would have sagged, causing a train to derail and great injury to passengers.
Albert Scardino, a spokesman for Mayor David N. Dinkins, said last night that the Mayor was aware of the dismissal but he would not comment on the degree of the Mayor's involvement in the decision. He would say only: "The Mayor has been in communication with his Commissioner of Transportation. It's his department and his decision to make about his staff."
The dismissal comes amid indications of growing dissension among officials and engineers of the Transportation Department on the bridge issue. Three deputy and assistant commissioners and senior officials in the Bridge Bureau who have supported Mr. Steinberger's position on the return of trains to the Manhattan Bridge said last night that they had lost faith in Mr. Riccio's ability to manage the city's bridges. They asked to remain anonymous, saying they feared retribution.
The dismissal comes at a time of increasing concern about the conditions of the city's bridges. In recent months, state inspectors have found evidence of rapid deterioration. More than half of the bridges are considered structurally deficient and unable to carry the loads for which they were designed.
As the city's fiscal problems have deepened, the Dinkins administration has said it would reduce the preventive maintenance program for bridges by 38 percent this year, to $5.8 million, and would reduce spending on other bridge projects to $930 million from $1.2 billion over the next five years.
In a rare move by a Deputy Commissioner, Mr. Steinberger openly opposed such cuts, saying the city was "creating a time bomb" on the bridges.
 
Officials Formerly Close
 Mr. Steinberger, who is 30 years old, joined the Transportation Department in 1982. Senior administration officials said that Mr. Riccio and Mr. Steinberger had been close at one time and that Mr. Riccio had sponsored Mr. Steinberger's promotion to Deputy Commissioner last January after Mr. Dinkins named Mr. Riccio the Commissioner. The promotion came even though Dinkins administration aides expressed some reservations about his qualifications.
But the senior administration officials said it was well known within the administration that the relationship had become strained recently and that Mr. Riccio had stopped discussing sensitive matters in the presence of his deputy because he feared that they would be leaked to reporters.
Mr. Steinberger said in an interview last night: "I have always tried to do what is right for the bridges and to be open about the seriousness of the problem. There was no other way to do this job. The public was counting on us."
 
'He Told Me Not to Write'
 Mr. Steinberger said Mr. Riccio had "made it clear to me on several occasions that he did not want to be informed of certain public safety risks concerning the bridges."
"He told me not to write certain memos like the one I wrote on the Manhattan Bridge because he felt that they were dangerous and there should be no public record of such warnings," Mr. Steinberger said.
Mr. Steinberger said he was shocked not only at his dismissal but at the way that it had happened. On Wednesday, he said, he was asked to report at 5 P.M. yesterday to the office of Michael Weiss, the Transportation Department's chief of staff.
Mr. Steinberger said he and Mr. Weiss were joined by Seth Cummings, the department's legal counsel, and Mr. Riccio. Mr. Steinberger said Mr. Riccio told him: "It's obvious we have significant differences, and I have two choices for you. Either you resign, or I will terminate you. I'll leave the details to Mike or Seth."
 
5 Minutes to Decide
 Mr. Riccio then left the office, and Mr. Weiss and Mr. Cummings told Mr. Steinberger that he had five minutes to decide, Mr. Steinberger said.
Mr. Steinberger said that he had asked the two officials if he could consult with his lawyer and that they had allowed him to use the telephone and left the office. Despite several attempts, Mr. Steinberger said, he was unable to reach his lawyer, and Mr. Weiss and Mr. Cummings knocked on the door of the office and demanded that he make a decision, he said. When he said he needed more time, they read him a letter informing him of his dismissal.
"At the direction of Commissioner Riccio, I am writing to advise you that your services as Deputy Commissioner of Bridges will be terminated as of 5 P.M. today," stated the letter, which was signed by Mark Barron, the Transportation Department's personnel director.
A native New Yorker, Mr. Steinberger joined the Transportation Department as an analyst after graduating with a degree in industrial engineering from the Columbia University School of Engineering. He held several management positions in the department's analysis division and became a Assistant Commissioner for Budget Management in 1988. In 1990, he was appointed Deputy Commssioner for Bridges.
Mr. Steinberger is enrolled in the M.B.A. program for executives at the Wharton School of Economics and said he expected to receive his M.B.A. in the spring.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
War and Peace: A Sampling From the Debate on Capitol Hill

 BODY:
Senator George J. Mitchell
Democrat of Maine
Today the Senate undertakes a solemn constitutional responsibility to decide whether to commit the nation to war. In this debate, we should focus on the fundamental question before us: what is the wisest course of action for our nation in the Persian Gulf crisis.
In its simplest form, the question is whether Congress will give the President an unlimited blank check to initiate war against Iraq at some unspecified time in the future under circumstances which are not now known and cannot be foreseen. 

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	This is not a debate about whether force should ever be used. No one proposes to rule out the use of force; we cannot and should not rule it out. The question is should war be truly a last resort when all other means fail or should we start with war, before other means have been fully and fairly exhausted.
This is not a debate about American objectives in the current crisis. There is broad agreement in the Senate that Iraq must fully and unconditionally withdraw its forces from Kuwait. The issue is how best to achieve that goal. Most Americans and most members of Congress, myself included, supported the President's initial decision to deploy American forces to Saudi Arabia to deter further Iraqi aggression. We supported the President's effort in marshaling international diplomatic pressure and the most comprehensive embargo in history against Iraq.
I support that policy. I believe it remains the correct policy, even though the President abandoned his own policy before it had time to work. The change began on Nov. 8, when President Bush announced that he was doubling the number of American troops in the Persian Gulf to 430,000 in order to attain a credible offensive option. The President did not consult with Congress about that decision; he did not try to build support for it among the American people. He just did it.
In so doing, President Bush transformed the United States' role and its risks in the Persian Gulf crisis. In effect, the President, overnight, with no consultation and no public debate, changed American policy from being part of a collective effort to enforce economic and diplomatic sanctions into a predominantly American effort, relying upon the use of American military force.
Despite the fact that his own policy of international economic sanctions was having a significant effect upon the Iraqi economy, the President, without explanation, abandoned that approach and instead adopted a policy based first and foremost upon the use of American military force. As a result, this country has been placed on a course toward war. This has upset the balance of the President's initial policy, the balance between resources and responsibility, between interest and risk, between patience and strength. 

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	It may become necessary to use force to expel Iraq from Kuwait, but because war is such a grave undertaking, with such serious consequences, we must make certain that war is employed only as a last resort.
 
Representative Robert H. Michel
Republican of Illinois
I speak from the prejudice of being a combat veteran of World War II. And those of our generation know from bloody experience that unchecked aggression against a small nation is a prelude to an international disaster.
Saddam Hussein today has more planes and tanks and, frankly, men under arms, than Hitler had at the time when Prime Minister Chamberlain came back from Munich with that miserable piece of paper -- peace in our time. I'll never forget that replay of that movie in my life.
And I have an obligation, I guess, coming from that generation, to transmit those thoughts I had at the time to the younger generation who didn't experience what we did. Saddam Hussein not only invaded Kuwait, he occupied, terrorized, murdered civilians, systematically looted and turned a peaceful nation into a wasteland of horror. He seeks control over one of the world's vital resources, and he ultimately seeks to make himself the unchallenged anti-Western dictator of the Mideast.
Either we stop him now, and stop him permanently, or we won't stop him at all.
Now the President has clearly presented the reasons why we can't stand by idly. In his words, and I quote them -- we're in the gulf because the world must not and cannot reward aggression, and we're there because our vital interests are at stake. Now we're told by some that we must show patience. We must wait for sanctions to work.
We must wait six months or a year before forces are used. We must stay the course. My question is this -- stay what course? A course that allows Saddam to know he is freed from surprise attack, free from sudden offensive movement for six months or a year or more? And I guess to you who advocate that course, I would have to ask you to do -- what you would do about the attitude of the American people in that interval period of time? How long is the American people -- will the American people put up with that?
 
Senator Strom Thurmond
Republican of South Carolina
Mr. President, how much longer can we expect them to maintain their combat readiness? How much longer can we expect our soldiers' families to carry on under the tremendous burdens they are carrying? They are not only dealing with the uncertainty of not knowing how much longer their loved ones will be gone from home but also with anguish that war could break out at any moment.
Mr. President, the Congress must act and let its voice be heard. The time to end the debate is now. I implore this body to demonstrate to the world and especially Saddam Hussein that we are behind our President and the United Nations. A vote in support of the President is a vote for peace. I urge my colleagues to stop the debate and show our solidarity with the President and resolve to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. Solidarity, we need it now, not division, but solidarity.
 
Senator Edward M. Kennedy
Democrat of Massachusetts
I urge the Senate to vote for peace, not war. Now is not the time for war. I reject the argument that says Congress must support the President, right or wrong. We have our own responsibility to do what is right, and I believe that war today is wrong.
War is not the only option left to us in the Persian Gulf. The President may have set Jan. 15 as his deadline, but the American people have not. Sanctions and diplomacy may still achieve our objectives, and Congress has the responsibility to insure that all peaceful options are exhausted before resort to war. Unless we reach that stage, Congress ought not to authorize the President to use force.
At this historic moment, it may well be that only Congress can stop this senseless march toward war. 

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	Let there be no mistake about the cost of war. We have arrayed an impressive international coalition against Iraq, but when the bullets start flying, 90 percent of the casualties will be Americans. It is hardly a surprise that so many other nations are willing to fight to the last American to achieve the goals of the United Nations. It is not their sons and daughters who will do the dying. Most military experts tell us that a war with Iraq would not be quick and decisive, as President Bush suggests; it'll be brutal, and costly. It'll take weeks, even months, and will quickly turn from an air war to a ground war, with thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, of American casualties.
The Administration refuses to release casualty estimates, but the 45,000 body bags the Pentagon has sent to the region are all the evidence we need of the high price in lives and blood that we will have to spare. Military experts have used Israel's two recent desert wars as reliable indicators of the casualties we will suffer. In the Six-Day War in 1967, Israel suffered 3,300 casualties out of a force of 300,000, including 7,000 dead. In the heavier fighting that lasted 20 days in the 1973 war, Israeli casualties were 11,000 out of a force of a similar size, with 2,600 dead.
In other words, we're talking about the likelihood of at least 3,000 American casualties a week, with 700 dead, for as long as the war goes on.
 
Senator John C. Danforth
Republican of Missouri
The one and only chance to accomplish our objectives without war is to maintain sanctions accompanied by a credible military threat. Without a credible military threat, our alternative is sanctions followed by nothing at all. The key to peace is maintaining a credible military threat, and this is precisely the point our pending votes will address.
Those who would give sanctions a chance before military action is even possible would decouple the two components which must be kept linked if we have any chance of getting Iraq out of Kuwait without a fight. They would foreclose any possibility of a just peace.
This is why I cannot vote for sanctions alone. This is why I cannot vote to deprive the President of the credible threat of force. It is indeed a supreme irony that it is only through the threat of force that a stable world can be maintained. But that is an irony that we have recognized ever since World War II.
 
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Democrat of New York
Suddenly, on behalf of Kuwait, in opposition to Iraq, we see the largest array of armed force since the -- mankind has seen since the Second World War. And we see a President declaring -- assserting that he has the right to send those armed forces into battle independently of any judgment of the Senate. . . .
Now how could this happen? The first post-cold-war crisis, as we have had it described. I'd like to suggest, Mr. President, and I hope this might help us think about the subject -- I'd like to suggest that despite the assertions that this was the first post-cold-war crisis, and the way in which we've proceeded in that mold and which manner obtained the universal support of the country, and the Senate here -- or as near to it as makes no matter -- suddenly there is an institutional lurch back in to the manner and mode of the cold war. 

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	Then the assertions we have heard in the past months, after the lurching from a defensive, deterrent position -- which we responded to very well -- into an offensive position, on Nov. 8; a measure taken in secret and that certainly suddenly turned what had been a collective security operation, with the complete support of the country and the world, into a crisis situation. And all through those things, the President as Commander in Chief, secretly moving to create the ongoing permanent Orwellian crisis.

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	What we find here is a kind of time warp in which we don't -- we're acting in an old mode with response to a new condition. I find it, for example, extraordinary that the President should so personalize the encounter with this particular thug in Baghdad -- the most recent thug in Baghdad, not the last by any means; there'll be others, they'll succeed each other. We are not in an international crisis in the sense that events that took place on Aug. 2 necessitate the confrontation of the largest set of armed forces since World War II. Nothing large happened. A nasty little country invaded a littler, but just as nasty, country. 

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	Mr. President, our armies have been on the Rhine for 45 years, and that is to stop a Roman legion. I mean, we're still at Panmunjom. We have had naval force with some land facilities -- a base facilities -- in the gulf since the Second World War.
Well, 12 months have passed, 18 months have passed, life will go on and we will not have the wrenching Constitutional crisis that will come about with the President committing a massive use of our armed forces in a distant region of the world without the specific declaration of war by Congress.
 
Senator Orrin G. Hatch
Republican of Utah
Mr. President, I have been watching this debate with a great deal of interest today and frankly I'm very concerned about some of the comments that have been made. I think President Bush has gone the extra mile in trying to avoid the use of force. I don't think there's any question about that. And I think it's time for Congress to help rather than hinder the President.
I think it's time for the Congress to join with the President and get behind him and our young men and women over there sitting in the sand and show that we're willing to back the use of force. I never thought I'd see the day when a timid organization like the United Nations would come out and agree and authorize the use of force by Jan. 15 and all members of Congress are unwilling to back their resolution, some of them.
Unless Saddam Hussein believes that the threat of war is real, he will not budge. I think we've learned that. The only way to avoid war, in my opinion in this particular situation, is to be prepared to go to war and to show that our resolve is for real. If Hussein won't even accept a letter from President Bush, he certainly is not going to accept Congressional clues that Iraq pull out from Kuwait. Our actions should be decisive.
If we back the President overwhelmingly we will maximize the pressure on Iraq, we will enhance the chances that we can avoid war. If the vote is close, Saddam Hussein can conclude that he can divide our country if he will only hold out. If we fail to back the President, war will become inevitable.
 
Senator Bill Bradley
Democrat of New Jersey
President Bush and Secretary Baker apparently have not addressed these four most probable outcomes from using massive military force. They have not apparently thought through how to deal with the potential power vacuum in Iraq, or how to cushion the negative Arab reaction to the use of massive force or how to resist pressure from our Arab coalition partners to sell out Israel, or how to prevent an isolationist reaction to a bloody war whose purpose has been inadequately explained.
Because they have not prepared for tomorrow's reaction, they should not commence offensive action today.
 
Senator Claiborne Pell
Democrat of Rhode Island
As amongst those who've served their country in war, and one who has pressed in the United States Senate for the toughest possible nonmilitary response to years of Iraqi lawbreaking, I believe that at this time, peace and the continuation of comprehensive sanctions is the wisest course, strongest course, best course for our nation.
 
Senator Arlen Specter
Republican of Pennsylvania
I personally remain hopeful, Mr. President, that war will be avoided. But it seems to me that the best way to avoid a war is to put Iraq squarely on notice with a very strong support by the Congress of the U.N. resolution and the President that we mean business and we're prepared to fight.
We wonder about the state of mind of Saddam Hussein. We wonder if he's a madman, Mr. President, and I submit that he is not. Senator Shelby and I had an opportunity to visit for an hour and 20 minutes with President Saddam Hussein just about a year ago today and I found him very poorly informed about the U.S. policy, very poorly informed about Western attitudes, did not have an understanding of our attitude about the problems of the Mideast. But he was certainly far from a mad man.
And there was later another Senate delegation with Senator Dole and Senator Metzenbaum and Senator McClure, Senator Murkowski, Senator Simpson and those senators also had a discussion with President Saddam Hussein and concluded that he was not a mad man. And we wonder what is his calculation.
It seems to me that if the current course is followed and force is used, that President Saddam Hussein will lose his country but he must have some other calculation. He may have a calculation of involving Israel in a war. He may have a calculation of trying to bring the coalition into disintegration so the Arabs will fight the Israelis. Or what he really may have in mind, and it's obviously speculative to try to figure out what is President Saddam Hussein's state of mind, he may have in mind the state of mind of the United States Congress. And that is a more perplexing state of mind than the mind of Saddam Hussein.
The comments have been made, I think it was the distinguished majority leader who raised that question about what was the will of Congress, doubt about the will of the Senate, always doubt about what we are undertaking, but if we unequivocally put Iraq and its President on notice of our intentions by a solid vote, it is my judgment that we will have an excellent chance to avoid that war.
 
Representative Richard A. Gephardt
Democrat of Missouri
I want to say tonight that if Saddam Hussein listens to this debate -- and we're told that he does pick up some American television -- I hope that he will take no comfort from this debate. We are united in our purpose in this country and in this Congress. Some have expressed concern that when there is a division of opinion even on strategy, that that lends help to the other side. I hope that we'd never mistake disagreement on means as disunity within our country. I can't remember a time when our country has been as unified around a set of goals, as focused on what we're trying to do, in as much agreement and unity as I think we are tonight.
 
Representative Patricia Schroeder
Democrat of Colorado
I rise in support of the gentleman from Indiana and Congressman Gephardt's resolution. I think it fits exactly what we know about leadership. What we have learned over and over and over again about leadership is first you commit the nation and then you commit the troops. Tonight we're talking about are we going to go even further and commit the troops way beyond where the nation is committed. I think the Hamilton-Gephardt resolution fits exactly where we are in our commitments.
No. 1, it protects U.S. forces. It allows use of force if our U.S. forces overseas are attacked. That's very important.
No. 2, it keeps our commitment to defend Saudi Arabia and use force if Saudi Arabia is attacked. The American people support that, and that makes sense.
Then it also allows for use of force if the sanctions are violated in any manner, and that's our commitment, and that makes sense. What it does not do is say that we're going to put everything out there and go for it on the 15th. I do not know why we cut off our options and decided that on Jan. 15 we had to give the President what is the equivalent of a declaration of war.
 
Senator William V. Roth Jr.
Republican of Delaware
The fact remains, such a united coalition is truly historic. A coalition that reflects the worldwide concern about Saddam Hussein, his belligerent character and frightening objectives. This alignment is the result of several important factors, factors that we must consider as we debate the resolutions before us.
Perhaps the first and foremost factor concerns Iraq's growth in both quantity and quality of military power. It continues at a threatening pace, despite the fact that Hussein's war with Iran is long ended.
Let no one be caught sleeping. To close an eye now would allow him the deadly latitude to consolidate his power and amass a nuclear arsenal. He is willing to bend any law and make almost any sacrifice toward these ends. He is an unpredictable as a desert storm and as deceptive as a mirage.
One can only imagine what devastating consequence would fall should his dominance be allowed in the oil-rich Middle East. And this is the second reason why he must be stopped. When I speak of the danger that would result from his control of this region, I'm not talking about consequences to major oil companies -- quite simply, I'm talking about jobs. I'm talking about the raw material of human endeavor.
Oil runs the economy of the world. It fuels our factories, heats our homes. Carries our products from manufacture to market. It's as basic to the economy as water is to life. And the free trade and international supplies is critical, not only for the industrial democracies, but the fragile third world nations that depend on this precious resource even more than we do.
Any attempt to disrupt these supplies will send a devastating quake to these economies, lengthening unemployment lines, boosting inflation in the industrial democracies and crushing the economies of developing countries where day to day existence depends on imported energy sources.
 
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Democrat of Delaware
If there's a war, 95 percent of the casualties on the world's side will be American. If there's a war, we will prevail, we will win the battle, but 95 percent of the enmity of the Arab world outside of Iraq, to the extent there is any, will be directed at the United States. 

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	In light of this, Mr. President, it seems almost impossible to believe that we're having a serious argument in this country today about whether under the Constitution the President alone can take a nation to war. The Constitution's language says that the war powers rest with the Congress. And from James Madison to John Marshall, the Constitution's fathers all understood this to be a key principle of the republic.
And lest anyone in this body or anyone listening wonder why I'm raising this question since there's already a resolution before us, I'm raising it because the President continues to insist he does not need, does not need the will of the people spoken through the Congress as envisioned by the Constitution to decide whether or not to go to war.
On Tuesday President Bush asked this Congress to debate and decide whether to take the nation to war yet unfortunately the President stopped short of abandoning his previous claim that he has the power acting alone to start a war.
And just yesterday, as I mentioned earlier, the President himself said that he alone has the constitutional authority to initiate war. No President before him has ever said anything like that. No President in our history has ever made such an assertion. To put it simply these views are at odds with the Constitution. They may accurately describe the power of leaders of other countris, but they do not describe the power of the President of the United States. 

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	If the President, at least in his statements, appears willing to violate our Constitution to achieve those objectives, if this crisis is really about upholding the law of nations, I suggest the President acknowledge that he start here by upholding the law at home and clearly acknowledge that only the Congress can take this nation to war.
 
Senator Paul D. Wellstone
Democrat of Minnesota
I rise to speak in this chamber for the first time with a very heavy heart. I wanted my first speech to be about children and education and health care and a credible energy policy and the environment. I never thought that the first time I would have an opportunity to speak in this chamber the topic would be such a grave topic -- life and death, whether or not to go to war, to ask America's men and women, so many of them so young to risk life and limb, to unleash a tremendous destructive power on a foreign country and a far away people. This is the most momentous decision that any political leader would ever have to make and decide we must.
And let no one doubt that the Congress has the responsibility to make this decision. The Constitution is unambiguous on this point: Congress declares the war, not the President.

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	The policies that I am afraid the Administration is pursuing, the rush to war that I am afraid is so much of what is now happening in our country and the world, will not create a new order, Mr. President, it will create a new world disorder. What kind of victory will it be? What kind of victory will it be if we unleash forces of fanaticism in the Middle East and a chronically unstable region becomes even more unstable further jeopardizing Israel's security? 

 	 	 		. . .	 		 	 	Some causes are worth fighting for, some causes are worth fighting for. This cause is not worth fighting for right now. We must stay the course with economic sanctions, continue the pressure, continue the squeeze, move forward on the diplomatic front and Mr. President, we must not, we must not rush to war.
 
Senator Paul Simon
Democrat of Illinois
Mr. President, there is a grim mood here in Congress as I do not recall. When you and I were elected to the House, Mr. President, in 1974, we were already involved in the Vietnam War but it was being pulled down and I have not experienced this kind of a mood before in Washington D.C. We face unprovoked aggression. No question about it. And there is no question in the minds of anyone here that Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi troops have to get out of Kuwait, one way or another.
When you grow up in rural America and live in rural America you learn something very simple: don't corner a rattlesnake. Give the rattlesnake a way to get out. And that's what we have to do in the situation over there. But I have to say the diplomatic option looks very, very difficult.
The second option is the economic option, sanctions. This was imposed by the President, and the President and the Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense appear to have all but given up on this. And I suggest the evidence is pretty overwhelming that this has a chance to succeed if we stick with it. No one can guarantee it but I think it has a chance.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Antiwar Effort Buds Quickly, Nurtured by Activism of 60's

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
Before a shot has been fired between allied forces and Iraq, an antiwar movement has been building quietly in the United States since late October, drawing on the legacy of Vietnam War peace activists.
Every leading religious denomination in the country officially opposes a gulf war now as morally unjustifiable and maintains that economic sanctions need time to work and that negotiations have not been fully explored. 
 For essentially the same reasons, nine large unions, representing six million workers, announced their opposition to a war yesterday, a sharp contrast to unions' support of American involvement in Vietnam. Hundreds of district offices of other unions have already stated their opposition to a war, which they say would be largely fought by the children of blue-collar workers.
Political bodies are taking stands, too. In Montana, for example, the Legislature, the Missoula County Commission and the Missoula City Council are on the verge of passing resolutions calling on President Bush and Congress to pursue diplomatic and economic remedies to the gulf crisis, said Representative Pat Williams, a Democrat who has represented Missoula and the western half of Montana in Congress for seven terms.
"This is Middle America speaking," Mr. Williams said.
Although many influential institutions have spoken out against a gulf war, polls show the nation as a whole divided on the question. The latest New York Times/CBS News poll shows almost the same support for a war now as for giving sanctions more time.
In part the antiwar effort reflects the number of anti-Vietnam War campaigners who now hold positions of power in mainstream institutions. In part it is an artifact of antiwar positions that the institutions themselves eventually adopted during the Vietnam War, said Todd Gitlin, professor of sociology at the University of California at Berkeley.
The movement has grown slowly in the past five months in the face of widespread public support for Mr. Bush's efforts in bringing nearly worldwide condemnation of Iraq. Support for his policy began to develop hairline cracks after Nov. 29, when the United Nations approved the use of force if Iraq did not leave Kuwait by Jan. 15.
"But even in this climate it is rather difficult for the antiwar movement to find clarity," said Raymond S. Franklin, director of the Michael Harrington Center for Democratic Values and Social Change at Queens College of the City University of New York.
 
Signs in the Polls
 Demographic variations in polling results suggest where the antiwar movement may be drawing its support from. Whites are evenly split on the use of force, but blacks favor continued reliance on sanctions by a 2-to-1 ratio. A majority of Republicans support military action; a majority of Democrats favor sanctions. Men support the use of force by a 3-to-2 ratio, while women support reliance on sanctions by an identical ratio.
There appears to be no division among churches. On Monday, 18 church leaders, representing every major denomination in America, published "A Message to the American People" as an advertisement in The New York Times. "Our nation must not submit to the inevitability of war," it stated. "By acting now on a very broad scale, we as people of faith will mobilize on behalf of a peaceful alternative."
One author of the message was Auxiliary Bishop Thomas J. Gumbleton of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. "Our only hope is to stop the war before it starts," he said in an interview, "because once it starts, I am afraid our protests will do little good because the military says it will bring the war to a horrendous conclusion quite quickly."
An overwhelming majority of the 300 bishops at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in November endorsed a resolution opposing a gulf war as morally wrong, Bishop Gumbleton said, adding that the conference did not oppose the Vietnam War until 1971.
The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, General Secretary-elect of the National Council of Churches and a co-author of the Times advertisement, said, "The depth of opposition among church leaders is very strong and would continue if there was a war, possibly moving into the realm of civil disobedience." The council, representing 42 million parishioners, is the nation's largest ecumenical organization.
Nine union presidents wrote an "open letter" to Mr. Bush, published yesterday as an advertisement in The Washington Post. Under the headline "Let the Sanctions Work," the officials said they "emphatically oppose the initiation of offensive military action by the United States at this time."
The unions represented in the letter stretch across the work force, from the National Education Association to the Communications Workers of American and the International Longshoremen and Warehousemen's Union.
This kind of institutional leadership provides a national structure and, organizers of peace rallies say, incalculable support for the otherwise fledgling antiwar movement. Included in the movement's nucleus are peace groups, Vietnam veterans associations, women's organizations, minority advocacy groups, families of soldiers, and those who want the Government to spend money on generating jobs, housing the homeless, caring for AIDS patients and rehabilitating drug addicts instead of financing a war.
Many people who have long been active in peace movements say there is no clear sense that today's antiwar movement will develop into a large resistance movement.
"I would say it is too early to judge," said Philip F. Berrigan, who was arrested Dec. 30 with 11 other demonstrators after they poured red dye, symbolic of the blood that could flow in a Middle East war, into a fountain on the White House grounds."
The first real measure of the antiwar movement's strength may come Monday night, on the eve of the United Nations deadline, when candlelight marches, all-night prayer vigils and rallies are scheduled to take place in Washington and in hundreds of cities and towns. Antiwar coalitions are also planning large demonstrations at the Capitol on Jan. 19 and 26.
While the Jan. 19 march is solely intended to oppose the American role in the gulf, organizers of the second one have a broader agenda -- a United Nations peace conference "to end all foreign occupations in the Middle East," including Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Syria's of most of Lebanon.
While some Jewish peace organizations like the New York chapter of the International Jewish Peace Union have endorsed the second march, national Jewish organizations have generally steered clear of the antiwar movement.
If war breaks out, the United States could become sharply polarized, said Charles Chatfield, professor of history at Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio.
"The historical pattern is that in the opening scenes of war there is strong public affirmation of the Government and the war; then ambivalence starts to sink in as the body bags come home," said Dr. Chatfield, who with Charles DeBenedetti wrote "An American Ordeal" (Syracuse University Press; 1990), a chronicle of the antiwar movement in the Vietnam era.
"But there is already great public ambivalence about this war," he added, "and antiwar activism could rise very quickly."

CORRECTION-DATE: January 12, 1991, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the opening paragraphs of an article yesterday about the antiwar movement misstated the extent of religious opposition to a war in the Persian Gulf. Leading Christian denominations in the United States have announced opposition to such a war; national Jewish organizations have not been a part of the antiwar effort.

GRAPHIC: Photo: As the deadline for war in the Persian Gulf draws nearer, an antiwar movement is building in the United States. A teach-in at Michigan State University on Wednesday discussed the possibility of the military draft being re-enacted. A student, above, in favor of the draft, was shouted down.

While the Jan. 19 march is solely intended to oppose the American role in the gulf, organizers of the second one have a broader agenda -- a United Nations peace conference "to end all foreign occupations in the Middle East," including Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip and Syria's of most of Lebanon.
While some Jewish peace organizations like the New York chapter of the International Jewish Peace Union have endorsed the second march, national Jewish organizations have generally steered clear of the antiwar movement.
If war breaks out, the United States could become sharply polarized, said Charles Chatfield, professor of history at Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio.
"The historical pattern is that in the opening scenes of war there is strong public affirmation of the Government and the war; then ambivalence starts to sink in as the body bags come home," said Dr. Chatfield, who with Charles DeBenedetti wrote "An American Ordeal" (Syracuse University Press; 1990), a chronicle of the antiwar movement in the Vietnam era.
"But there is already great public ambivalence about this war," he added, "and antiwar activism could rise very quickly."

HEADLINE: How to Trade Lawyer Futures as a Commodity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Broken Contracts" by Judge Irving R. Kaufman (Op-Ed, Dec. 17) bemoans mass firings at law firms. Firms overhired lawyers and are now cutting them mercilessly. Judge Kaufman suggests that the practice of law should be "insulated from the vagaries of the marketplace."
The decision a law firm makes when it hires is economically similar to the decision a wheat farmer makes at planting time. Neither knows what the future demand will be for the product or service that it commits itself to supplying.
There is a mechanism to insulate wheat farmers against the vagaries of the marketplace -- a future contract. Why not have service-based futures contracts? The Consumer Price Index component of the service costs could be used to price such contracts.
A law firm that contemplates hiring a lot of lawyers could sell forward a legal services future to lock in a price for these lawyers for a period. Lawyers are not as fungible (or as cheap) as wheat, but the major component of lawyer demand risk can be removed with such a contract.
The natural buyers of such contracts would be large consumers of legal services, such as takeover-minded corporations, utilities or divorce-seeking billionaires.
By signaling future demand for services, such futures contracts could help smooth out the vagaries of which Judge Kaufman complains, leading to less career disruption. As the United States economy becomes more service-based, the same capital market mechanisms that smooth the supply and demand for products should be extended to the supply and demand for services.

HEADLINE: Toward a Three-State Truck-Freight Network

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The decision by Franklin E. White, New York State Transportation Commissioner, to create lanes for high-occupancy vehicles on the Long Island Expressway, thus encouraging ride sharing (news article, Jan. 3), deserves loud cheers and many congratulations from those of us who have urged creativity in transportation planning.
However, this should be seen as a first step in rethinking the use of the scarce transportation resources in this congested region. The discussion of the new expressway lanes has focused on passenger traffic, and Mr. White's response tries to deal with the passenger portion of the transportation gridlock.
At least equally important is the commercial congestion on the roads and highways of our region. We are a region whose economic survival depends on the movement of goods. The efficient and rapid movement of freight is a more important and valuable use of scarce "cement" resources than the movement of people.
An especially creative extension of Mr. White's decision would be to designate the new expressway lanes as lanes for high occupancy vehicles for rush hours (morning and afternoon) and as lanes for trucks for the rest of the 24-hour period.
This could become the beginning of a dedicated three-state freight network which, by recognizing the importance of that sector, could greatly improve the economic health of this part of the country.
Our history has been to create road networks (the parkways) from which we barred truck traffic. That approach encouraged individual automobile use at the expense of protecting the economic lifeline of the region. As we look to the future, we would be far better served by a campaign that discourages passenger automobile traffic and encourages the flow of goods.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Senator Tries to Balance Party and Constituency

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
James Jeffords' views of the Middle East were shaped in 1957, when he served on the first ship that steamed through the reopened Suez Canal.
The Republican Senator from Vermont, then a young Navy ensign, had been told that the Egyptians would welcome the Americans with open arms; instead, the seamen had to turn their fire hoses on Egyptian nationalists who shouted anti-American slogans as they tried to board the destroyer. 
 The canal had been closed as a result of the Israeli attack on Sinai and the joint British-French invasion of the canal zone. The United States had intervened to persuade the British, French and Israelis to withdraw their forces.
That experience, Mr. Jeffords recalled today, has contributed to his reluctance to support President Bush's call on Congress to support the use of force against Iraq if it does not withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15.
 
'Bitterness' Against West
 "We naively thought we'd be welcomed as heroes only to find incredible nationalistic bitterness against any Westerners, even though we came in on the side of the Egyptians," the 56-year-old first-term Senator said. "It left an indelible impression of how little we understand the thinking in the Middle East."
Mr. Jeffords is one of the few senators who remain undecided on whether to support authorizing the President to use force. He firmly believes that the Administration should give economic sanctions more time to work and just as firmly opposes a ground war involving American troops. But he has not decided whether to support a resolution being introduced by the Senate Democratic leader, George Mitchell of Maine, that calls for continued use of sanctions and diplomacy to persuade Iraq to leave Kuwait while not ruling out force at some time in the future.
Mr. Jeffords said he is concerned that if he votes for the resolution, it will send a signal of weakness to Iraq. If he votes against it, he will be voting with his party but against his conscience and his consituency. Ninety percent of the 700 phone calls and letters he has received in the last month have urged him to oppose any move that would involve the United States in a war.
 
'To Express Weakness'
 "I'm torn on the resolution," he admitted. "I'm sitting here today and saying what a lousy time it is for us to vote, to express weakness, to imply that we don't support the President."
Unlike the Administration and most of his colleagues, Mr. Jeffords, a Harvard-educated lawyer who served in the House for 14 years before he was elected to the Senate in 1988, is not discouraged by Wednesday's meeting in Geneva between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq. He is also heartened by France's independent diplomatic initiative that favors an international conference to discuss both the gulf crisis and the Arab-Israeli dispute.
"Baker and the Iraqi talked diplomatically and frankly and talked for a long time," Mr. Jeffords said. "To hear the Iraqi welcome the United Nations head to Baghdad and basically explain what would be an acceptable resolution of the crisis, I come away from that and say, that's a lot more than what I expected. And we know the French are pushing a peaceful solution. So how can the United States refuse that?"
 
Blame It on the U.N.
 Although Mr. Jeffords said he agrees with Mr. Bush that there should not be any linkage between the gulf crisis and the Arab-Israeli dispute, as the Iraqis have demanded, he added, "We can blame the linkage on the U.N."
As a Congressman, Mr. Jeffords voted against the Reagan Administration more often than with it. He was the only Republican to vote against Mr. Reagan's 1981 tax bill. He also opposed aid to the anti-Sandinista rebels in Nicaragua in 1986, opposed limits on abortion and voted to override a number of Presidential vetoes.
But this time, neither his conscience nor his constituency will determine how he votes. He will make his decision based on what he calls "the spin" or interpretation from the White House. Although the Mitchell resolution "is pretty hard to vote against," he said, he will vote against it if the White House presses him to do so.
"If the President says that the resolution is pulling the rug out from under him and will interfere with efforts to bring about a peaceful solution, then I don't want to do anything that will be counter-productive," he said. "If the White House says as far as it's concerned, this is nothing more than an expression of Congress that they have the authority to declare war, and you can vote however you feel you should, then I'll go ahead and vote for it."
No matter how he votes, Mr. Jeffords said that he will continue to oppose an American-led full-scale ground war against Iraq. "We don't want to get into a desert war with tanks or with door-to-door combat in Kuwait," he said. "It's just not worth it in terms of what there is to be gained."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
New Chairman Hired At Jordan Marsh Chain

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
Jordan Marsh, battered by the New England recession, announced yesterday that it had hired a new chairman and chief executive with a turnaround background.
The company, a subsidiary of the Allied Stores Corporation, named Harold S. Frank, 64, a former chief executive at Bradlees discount stores, to succeed Richard F. Van Pelt, 50. The company said Mr. Van Pelt was retiring for personal reasons and to pursue other business opportunities. 
 Jordan Marsh is a leading New England department store chain, with 24 stores. Allied and Allied's sister company, Federated Department Stores Inc., are still owned by the troubled Campeau Corporation of Canada, but they are both in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and operating under the jurisdiction of a Federal bankruptcy judge.
"Clearly, the sagging New England economy has impacted Jordan Marsh's performance in the past year," said Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive of Allied and Federated. "We are confident that under Hal Frank's experienced direction and business leadership, Jordan Marsh can be returned to prior levels of solid, consistent and profitable performance."
The company recently announced a further retrenchment. After closing stores in Danbury, Conn., and Lowell, Mass., last year, it said it would close stores in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Worcester, Mass., and Derby and Southbury Conn., by the end of March, reducing its chain to 20 outlets.
By taking the top post at Jordan Marsh, Mr. Frank is returning to the retailing industry full time. He left Bradlees in 1988 after the company was taken over by the Stop and Shop Companies. Mr. Frank joined Bradlees in 1977, when he was recruited as president, and he turned the company into one of the nation's most successful regional chains in terms of sales and profits, Allied said.
Mr. Van Pelt joined Jordan Marsh in 1983 as an executive vice president. After a time working for Allied, he returned to Jordan Marsh in 1988 as vice chairman and was named chairman in January 1989.
"We understand Dick Van Pelt's decision to step down from the chairmanship and his desire to spend more time with his family," Mr. Questrom said.
Mr. Frank is a graduate of Dartmouth and its Amos Tuck School of Business. He started in 1948 at the Abraham & Straus division of Federated and left Federated for a brief stint at Macy's from 1973 to 1974 before returning to Federated in its Gold Circle division.

HEADLINE: Restaurants

BYLINE: By Marian Burros

 BODY:
A new place on the Upper East Side restores the feeding frenzy of the 1980's with hearty food.
 Coco Pazzo is in a time warp. Behind the narrow, discreet facade on East 74th Street, the recession hasn't happened. Bland nursery food has not been rediscovered. The little black dress and the large black turtle neck are still in fashion. Eight o'clock dinner reservations require connections. 
Even though this is 1991 and the feeding frenzy of the last decade is a memory, the arrival of Coco Pazzo five weeks ago brought out the competitive spirit of the 80's, the one that sent masters of the universe rushing off to restaurants before the kinks were out of the kitchen. While the wood paneling from the previous restaurant tenant, Metro, was still being replaced with sand-colored paint and the electrical wires were still hanging from the ceilings, impatient neighbors were tapping on the window, demanding to know the opening date of Pino Luongo's newest restaurant.
 The neighborhood was ripe for something unself-conscious, a place where blue jeans sit side by side with Chanel suits. In the course of my four visits, the only person that got a second look was a young woman with six-inch heels and white makeup, wearing a black velvet cat suit with spaghetti straps. At Coco Pazzo almost anything goes.
 Mr. Luongo has an enviable reputation as the owner of the two-star Le Madri in Chelsea and Sapporo di Mare in East Hampton, L.I., where Coco Pazzo's chef, Mark Strausman, cooked to acclaim last summer. Mr. Luongo's first restaurant in New York, the one-star Il Cantinori, was one of the first to emphasize Tuscan cooking, a tradition that he has broadened to include other Italian regions at Coco Pazzo. This is not bistro food.
 This is cooking con brio. It satisfies the Italian soul in all of us who are tired of trends, who don't care anymore about the regional cooking of New Jersey or the Pacific Rim connection and who certainly could survive quite nicely without another helping of mother's beef stew.
 This is herbaceous, gutsy food that demands the best densely crusted home-baked breads to clean the plate, and it has made Coco Pazzo, which means Crazy Chef, the best restaurant to open in New York since last fall.
 The food is served in large portions by a pleasant, knowledgeable staff. On weekends, when meals are family style, it costs much less than it does during the rest of the week. To understand the pricing structure, you don't need to be a certified public accountant, but it wouldn't hurt. For example, on Wednesdays and Thursdays, rib-eye steak is $27 per person. On weekends, it is $30 for two. Other days have other menu configurations.
 There are a few drawbacks to Coco Pazzo and one of them -- the noise -- was being fixed this week, Mr. Luongo said. Now if he would just take about four tables out of the main dining room to relieve the crowding, there would not be too much left to criticize.
 There is, of course, the difficulty in choosing from among so many winning appetizers. The silken semolina dumplings with a creamy wild-mushroom sauce are finished with gorgeously perfumed truffle oil. For the dumplings, you should be willing to postpone your New Year's diet resolutions until tomorrow. The squid are sweet from grilling. The standard assortment of grilled chunks of vegetables has been replaced by thinly sliced beets, turnips, fennel, eggplant and zucchini, as well as radicchio and endive.
 Carpaccio goes the extra mile, topped not only with chips of Parmigiano Reggiano, but also with celery and garlicky zucchini.
 But perhaps the best overview of the chef's skills is his tasting of hot and cold appetizers, which change nightly: caponata; whole baby artichokes, deep-fried Jewish style; risotto frittata; panzanella, the thick Tuscan bread soup; homemade mozzarella stuffed with prosciutto, roasted pepper, eggplant and basil; bruschetta with olives, sun-dried tomato and garlic paste; the spaghetti-thin deep-fried blind eels. Even the head cheese, not an all-American favorite, was delicious. The white beans needed a few more minutes cooking, but that's nit-picking.
 Among the pasta courses, the spaghetti with garlic, oil and red pepper needed another 30 seconds in the pot, but no one could fault the sauce with its pleasing kick. Though the risotto could have been creamier, it contained a marvelous assortment of perfectly cooked seafood. The same seafood mixture another evening made a fine marriage with spaghetti.
 Rigatoni with sausage and peas; lasagna with game; rich gnocchi with the slight bitterness of arugula, and polenta with a deep wine-enriched rabbit sauce -- too many choices, so little time.
 Besides, if you have the pasta, will you have room for the meats and fish? Or the dessert?
 There's the spicy Tuscan seafood stew in which each morsel has been cooked to perfection in a zesty tomato sauce. Breast of pheasant stuffed with mushroom pate is uncommonly moist; grilled steak, tender and flavorful; grilled baby chicken, crisp and juicy.
 Nor would you be disappointed in rabbit and chicken stewed in red and white wine, respectively, or the platters of superb grilled game birds served on weekends.
 The accompanying vegetables are prepared with equal care.
 Where the kitchen falters is on the grilled shellfish platter and the roasted fish of the day. Overcooked, said one guest, "in true Tuscan fashion."
 And two of three salads had a bit too much lemon in the dressing, but the greens were sparkling fresh.
 Desserts, seldom of much interest in Italian restaurants, are important at Coco Pazzo. This stellar collection has been infused with an Italian sensibility. Polenta poundcake topped with a compote of fresh and dried fruits; olive-oil poundcake drenched in Grand Marnier; pear tart in a hazelnut crust; caramelized blood orange curd in a short crust; pistachio or chocolate semifreddo with bittersweet chocolate sauce; warm apple tart with a hint of clove; a flourless chocolate cake with espresso sauce, and a sumptuous tiramisu. Even the biscotti and cookies that are served with coffee are noteworthy.
 The wine list is user-friendly but could stand a few good bottles at lower prices, say, under $25.
 At family-style dinners on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings, you are encouraged to mix and match items, and the more there are in your party, the better the buy. The assortment of game birds, for example, is $27 for two, $39 for three and $48 for four.
 Instead of over-intellectualizing food, this unpretentious restaurant celebrates it. The sensuality of the dishes encourages you to linger at the table; as with the last few pages of a good book, you don't want the meal to end.

HEADLINE: Budapest Journal;
On a Clear Day, You Can Glimpse the Tow Trucks

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUDAPEST, Jan. 10

 BODY:
When the first tow trucks swooped through Budapest's car- and exhaust-choked streets more than a month ago, the public actually cheered, one more sign of just how fed up city residents are over traffic and air pollution.
Gabor Demszky, Budapest's new Mayor, quotes a poll that showed an 87 percent approval rating for his crackdown against illegally parked cars. Most surprising was the response from drivers themselves: 83 percent said they welcomed efforts to wean them of the habit of using the city's every nook and cranny as their personal driveway. 
 "Sometimes there have been sharp words, but mostly it is a very popular measure," said the Mayor, whose memories of having his car towed once in New York City are not so favorable.
 
Legendary Traffic
 So far, an Austrian-Hungarian tow company has hauled 1,000 vehicles to a distant pound in Budapest's 10th district, where they can be retrieved for $60. Mr. Demszky's only regret is that the city is not doing the job itself. "It's a great money maker," he said, already planning ahead.
Budapest traffic is legendary, particularly when it backs up on the six bridges linking Buda and Pest on either side of the Danube. With 2 million private cars for a population of 10.5 million, Hungarians have one of Eastern Europe's higher car-ownership rates, double the figure of 10 years ago. With an average 1.2 passengers per car, Budapest's daily automobile commuters are among the most resolute.
Few public parking garages, erratic meters and a city laid out at the turn of the century have made parking increasingly impossible in downtown Pest, but that does not stop drivers from hoisting their cars up onto three-inch-high sidewalks, blocking entranceways, perching on traffic islands or simply double parking.
Like other cities in the region, Hungary's capital is plagued by air so foul that it is often visible to the naked eye and strong enough to cause immediate irritation to the lungs. Researchers say the problem, which for a long time was publicly ignored by the Communist authorities, worsened dramatically in the last decade.
 
The Trabant Rears Its Head
 Although industrial pollution is also a problem, 70 percent of the pollutants circulating through Budapest are caused by motor vehicles. The main culprits are the former East bloc's fume-spewing specialties: the Trabant and the Wartburgs, with engines produced in what was once East Germany that emit high levels of hydrocarbons.
Hungarians, who have no car-manufacturing industry of their own, became particularly reliant on these vehicles, now estimated at 600,000 nationwide. Mayor Demszky said they made up 20 to 30 percent of vehicles registered in the city and according to other estimates, more than 10 percent of Budapest's taxi fleet of 20,000.
A recent decree by the Hungarian Government will subject all cars in Hungary to annual pollution inspections, and allow the police to pull off obvious polluters for random checks. Inspections had been required previously but only every third year, and the published emission standards came with a footnote, saying they did not apply to cars manufactured in Eastern Europe.
The latest measure, while welcomed by Hungary's increasingly impatient environmentalits, may also include loopholes. Experts say it is not difficult to rig the engines to meet standards at inspection time, or to persuade inspection stations to make exceptions.
"People will say, look, I didn't want to buy a Trabant either but that was all there was to buy when I could buy a car," said Zoltan Illes, a former official in the Ministry of the Environment. "And they will try all kinds of tricks to get around the inspections."
One way to reduce pollution would be to simply ban the offending vehicles, but even radicals admit that that option is socially explosive. Car ownership in Hungary has become a matter of class, with the newly affluent priding themselves on Western-bought Mercedeses, BMW's and the like, while Eastern European models -- Czechoslovak Skodas, Romanian Dacias, Soviet Ladas -- are the property of the middle- or working-class.
 
Environmental Thoughts
 Battling air pollution -- a subject that until the end of the Communist era had been considered off-limits for public debate -- has been a stated priority of Hungary's democratically elected Government, headed by Prime Minister Jozsef Antall. But environmentalists say they are disappointed with actions taken so far.
"In the beginning, the Government put an emphasis on the importance of environmental policies, but they have not done this," said Mr. Illes, who last month lost his job in a clash with top offficials. "Environmentalists have been pushed aside in all the parties. The problems are serious, public awarenesss is growing but decision makers are not ready to take action."
Environmentalists had tried to lobby for a dedicated tax to help Hungarian car owners buy catalytic converters as part of a campaign to switch to lead-free gasoline - which now amounts to only a small percent of gasline sales. Converters cost virtually a yearly salary, and at this point, the Hungarian tax code offers no incentive for buying cars with converters already installed, or for buying lead-free gasoline.
 
The Price of Towing
 But these and other incentives intended to push the driving public toward lead-free gasoline was rejected because of the country's continuing economic crisis, Mr. Illes said.
In Budapest, the towing campaign has given people a sense that something is being done to clean up the air, although there is no sign yet of any real change in traffic patterns.
Already hard hit by an almost 50 percent rise in gasoline prices, car owners must contemplate the prospect of seeing their beloved vehicle towed away on the back of a truck -- which may just make them think twice of getting behind the wheel.

Company Loyalty: A Potential Risk

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
The humbling of once-proud companies like Pan American World Airways and the Bank of New England has cracked the nest eggs of many of their loyal executives and employees who hold company stock, and it suggests a warning for others across America.
Do not tie up a disproportionate amount of personal assets in the employer's stock, experts say. 
 "I'm sure five years ago if you walked around the Bank of New England, a lot of people would have thought it was as solid as Plymouth Rock," said James E. Conway, a partner in the New York law firm of Hall, Dickler, Lawler, Kent & Friedman, and a former chairman of the Ayco Corporation, which provides financial planning advice to executives of many large companies.
"The operative words are diversification and asset allocation," he said, adding, "I wouldn't take it all out of a company plan." But for people who have accumulated big blocks of company stock in savings plans, 401(k) plans, through employee stock ownership plans or by exercising incentive stock options, holdings should be examined in the context of their overall assets, he said.
"For a savings or 401(k) plan, should you be in there to begin with?" Mr. Conway asked. "The answer is yes. It is generally advantageous to buy the company stock" because it is often offered at a discount, the company may match employee purchases and there are no commissions. But when holdings grow, it is time to diversify.
Many plans allow participants to diversify within the plan with no tax liability, he noted, giving employees the ability to choose, for example, among equity or bond mutual funds. What about people who own big blocks of company stock outright, thanks to ESOP's or incentive stock options, particularly when some of the holding was acquired years ago so that selling now would mean capital gains tax is due?
Stuart Becker, a C.P.A. who is president of Becker & Company, a tax and financial planning firm in New York, said, "Bite the bullet, pay the tax and diversify."
One way to escape the capital gains tax for people who have pledged money to a charity is to use appreciated stock for the pledge. It is deductible at fair market value on regular tax returns, no capital gains tax is due and the donor can put the equivalent amount into other investments.
Among top executives it is not uncommon to exercise their stocks options under incentive plans and sell six months later, Mr. Becker said. "I'm not saying show disloyalty or desert the ship," he added, but if 80, 90 or 100 percent of one's liquid net worth is in company stock, it would be a good idea to diversify into Treasury or municipal bonds.
"Then if a company goes under, they have a position to fall back on," he said. Even if a company or industry seems sound, diversification is advised.
For example, he said: "Toys 'R' Us is one of the best-managed, financially sound companies in America. Its earnings are strong, and, if anything, it is underleveraged," but its stock has declined to $23.50 from a 12-month high of $35, because traders fear it could be vulnerable in a recession. It may well rebound, of course, but managers who own company stock and have seen a third of their net worth wiped out need to decide if they have enough time and other resources to wait.
Diversification is particularly important as people get older, Mr. Conway said, because they are in less of a position to take risk. They have no time to make up losses and may depend on dividends to supplement other retirement income.
Yet often there is "some sort of emotional tie to the company stock" that keeps them from diversifying, he said, citing Citicorp as an example. Some longtime employees so admired its chairman, Walter Wriston, and later John S. Reed, that they would not think of selling its stock, even though it has plunged to $12.25 from a 12-month high of $28.75, and the company has had to cut its dividend.
By now, Citicorp may be undervalued, presenting an opportunity for investors looking for a turnaround situation, but that could take too long for a retiree whose portfolio value has already fallen.
Mr. Conway's approach is: Consider a defined benefit pension plan as being equivalent to a fixed-income portfolio. If a good chunk is being put into such a plan by the employer, a younger employee accumulating capital can use the savings or 401(k) plan for more risk-oriented investment like stocks. But as the employee grows older, "adopt a lower-risk profile, less exposure to equity."
With incentive stock options for those with already sizable holdings of the stock, he said, "I would buy, hold the requisite length of time and sell." It could go higher, so there is an opportunity loss, but not nearly so bad as a real economic loss.

HEADLINE: U.S. Oil Use Fell in '90, But So Did Production

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Driven by war fears, recession and the weather, the nation's petroleum consumption fell in 1990, the first year-to-year drop in seven years, the American Petroleum Institute said yesterday. Although the Government has called for conservation, the institute said other factors were responsible this year.
Domestic oil production, meanwhile, fell to 7.2 million barrels a day -- the lowest level since 1961. That is down 389,000 barrels a day, or 5.1 percent, from 1989. Since 1985, production is down 1.73 million barrels a day. Victor A. Burk, an oil expert at Arthur Anderson & Company in Houston, said that decline was equivalent to the prewar production of Kuwait, and its effect on the world oil market was "almost as if all the production from some of the OPEC countries had gone away." 
 Both use and domestic output are expected to fall further this year: consumption because of the weak economy and high prices, and production because American reserves are being pumped dry. The most attractive drilling prospects are now abroad.
 
 U.S. Output Encouraged
 The year-end report by the institute, the industry's main trade association, comes as the Energy Department is in the midst of an ambitious program to keep American production high because of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. Washington's efforts, and higher domestic prices, may in fact have had a small effect. While the decline in domestic crude production last year was large, it was not as steep as in the previous year, when the drop was 527,000 barrels a day.
Despite the figures, analysts say that from an investor's point of view, this is not an industry in decline. The drop in domestic deliveries, the industry's main measure of consumption, was 2.1 percent, to 16.96 million barrels a day, or about 28 percent of world production.
George Friesen, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Group, said: "I don't think declines of that magnitude are going to have a significant impact on profitability in refining and marketing. Refinery utilization is still tight."
He predicted a further decline in 1991, of about 1.2 percent.
 
 Overseas Exploration
 The decline in domestic production may not be bad news for the oil industry, said Michael L. Mayer, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder. "The industry has to maximize profits and cash flows," he said. "If greater flows can be generated by exploring for and developing resources outside of the United States, then that's where they ought to go."
Companies used to give development prospects in this country the benefit of the doubt in comparison with those in foreign countries, because even if the geologic prospects were questionable, the political risk was low. But, Mr. Mayer said, "it's just not true" any longer.
"What's the risk of a Point Arguello?" he said. "Chevron invested $2 billion there, and has produced zip."
Production at the Point Arguello field, off the Southern California coast near Santa Barbara, has been held up by fear of oil spills.
The decline in American output will probably be smaller in 1991, experts said, because of higher crude prices and other factors. Richard Nehring, president of NRG Associates, in Colorado Springs, said the decline would probably be 2 or 3 percent.
To spur production, the recent budget agreement included tax breaks for oil and gas drillers, but the industry has asked for more concessions, including access to offshore and Arctic areas closed for environmental reasons. The National Energy Strategy, prepared mostly by the Energy Department and under consideration by the White House, is expected to call for more concessions, but critics have argued that a "supply side" policy, which would reduce consumption in transportation and other fields by improving efficiency, would cut imports more.
 
 Import Share at 46.9%
 The 20 percent loss in output in recent years, plus growth in demand, has been made up by imports. In 1990, however, imports were more or less flat. The import share of domestic deliveries was 46.9 percent last year, up from 46.2 percent in 1989.
Deliveries of all leading oil products declined, except for jet fuel, which rose about 3.6 percent for the year because commercial miles flown increased by about 5 percent, the institute said. This was not good news for airlines, however, because they "added flights more quickly in 1990 than they added passengers," according to the institute's report.
Deliveries of gasoline, the biggest single petroleum product, fell 1.7 percent. Prices rose 30 cents a gallon between August and October, contributing to a fourth-quarter decline in consumption of about 3 percent, compared with the last quarter of 1989, the institute said.
Gasoline consumption has been moderated in the past by the gradual turnover in the nation's auto fleet, as newer cars, which get better fuel economy, replace older ones. But in the fourth quarter, the drop was large enough to suggest that Americans had driven less.
 
 Warmer Weather a Factor
 The drop in use of other forms of oil was partly weather-related. Last winter and the early part of this winter were mild, sharply lowering requirements for heating. But even if the weather had been normal, the institute said, deliveries would have fallen 1 percent. And two other factors in the decline, the Persian Gulf crisis and the economic slowdown, were felt most strongly in the fourth quarter, when deliveries were running 5.4 percent below the quarter a year earlier.
At the Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Eric Hirst, a research scientist, took note of the explanations offered by the industry for the decline, and said: "It's interesting that none of them have to do with improving efficiency. There is the beginning of a trend away from improving energy efficiency."
Mr. Hirst noted that new cars, on average, get lower gas mileage than those built two years ago, although still better than the cars of the 1970's and early 80's -- accounting for most of those being replaced.

HEADLINE: A Crystal Ball for Banking's Ills

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
No single statistic can foretell which banks will fail, but from the welter of financial reports banks issue, government and private analysts can glean strong hints which are the shakiest.
While most bank failures involve small institutions, analysts say that some large banks are in serious trouble. Among the weakest are the Midlantic Corporation in Edison, N.J., the nation's 31st-largest banking company, with banks in New Jersey and New York, and MNC Financial Inc. in Baltimore, the 25th-largest, which owns Maryland National Bank and American Security Bank in Washington. In the troubled New England area, the Maine Savings Bank in Portland and the New Hampshire Savings Bank in Concord are both insolvent, meaning they have no capital remaining to absorb future losses.
 
 Concerned About Panic
 Regulators talk about troubled banks only in general terms, concerned about causing a panic among depositors and customers that could make a failure inevitable. L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for example, says he expects about 170 of the nation's more than 12,000 banks to fail in 1991. Robert C. Clarke, Comptroller of the Currency, will go no further in identifying the weakest banks than to say that about 350 of the more than 4,000 banks he regulates are troubled, earning quality ratings of 4 or 5 on a a scale of one to five, with one the top rating.
But private analysts are thriving by identifying the banks most likely to fail and selling those opinions. 
 Of course, depositors of even the weakest banks continue to be insured for up to $100,000 an account under the rules of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Until the last few years, bank failures were mostly the result of fraud, and passed unnoticed outside their communities. But the collapse of 9 of the 10 largest banks in Texas in the late 1980's signaled that severe problems at large banks that dominate a state or region could have a widespread crippling effect.
While rating agencies do not have a good record predicting which banking companies will fail far in advance, they are useful in identifying the banks that are currently weak. For example, Veribanc, a rating company in Woburn, Mass., says that no bank with its best rating has ever failed, and that 96 percent of the approximately 200 banks that failed in 1989 carried its yellow or red ratings, indicating caution and extreme caution, respectively, for customers.
Currently, many analysts are warning about problems at several large banking companies, most of which have large concentrations of loans for construction of new real estate projects and mortgages on commercial properties.
One company recently removed from their list was the the Bank of New England Corporation, which collapsed Jan. 6. when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation took control of its banks in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine. Commercial mortgages and construction loans accounted for nearly 37 percent of the Bank of New England's loans, well above the average of about 14 percent for other large banks.
Likewise, MNC Financial lost $242 million in the first three quarters of 1990, as its delinquent loans and holdings of real estate acquired through foreclosure rose to $1.14 billion on Sept. 30, from $289.3 million a year earlier. With $4.5 billion, or about 27 percent of its total loans, in construction or mortgages of commercial real estate, analysts warn that the company could face more losses.
 
 Facing a Cash Squeeze
 MNC, whose bank units have been forced to borrow occasionally from the Federal Reserve, also faces a cash squeeze, with payments due in mid-January on nearly $650 million of bank loans and other notes. To raise cash and strengthen its financial condition, MNC is trying to sell its huge, highly profitable credit card business. The company had hoped to earn a profit of more than $1 billion from the sale, but so far has not found a buyer.
Midlantic Corporation of Edison, N.J., has also suffered greatly from real estate losses, and lost $182.4 million in the first three quarters of the 1990. Construction or mortgage loans on commercial real estate account for $5.5 billion, or 32 percent of its total loans.
Both MNC and Midlantic have enough capital -- funds invested by shareholders or retained from past years' profits -- to meet minimums set by regulators. But analysts at the Standard & Poor's Corporation and other rating agencies worry that the capital could evaporate quickly as a weakening economy causes prices of real estate to drop further, resulting in greater losses for the banks.
 
 Real Estate in a Free Fall
 "The commercial real estate market is in a free fall, and in the past few weeks it appears that the rate of decline has actually accelerated," said Thomas Hanely, a banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. "It does not bode well for the banks who are already overexposed to that activity."
The LACE Financial Corporation, Frederick, Md., assigned its lowest two ratings to 134 of the country's 974 banks with more than $300 million of assets at midyear. Those ratings "mean there is a relatively high probability of failure or some sort of restructuring," said Barron Putnam, president of LACE. "They do not have to fail outright, but we think they will need somebody to help them out."
The 134 troubled banks, whose names were not disclosed, include 2 of the country's largest multinational banks, 5 regional banks, including a savings bank with assets of more than $10 billion, 14 banks with assets between $3 billion and $10 billion, 28 banks with assets between $1 billion and $3 billion, and 85 banks between $300 million and $1 billion.
 
 Corporate Customers
 Bank problems have become increasingly important to corporate treasurers who rely on banks as both a safe place to invest excess cash and a reliable source of credit.
"The banks in trouble are also the most likely to cancel credit lines and cut back on lending," said Warren Heller, director of research at Veribanc Inc.
In his interviews of 100 treasurers of Fortune 500 companies, George Salem, a banking analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, found that "a massive shifting of deposit and other business is taking place for reasons of fear of a bank failure." He said that the strongest banks, like J. P. Morgan & Company and the First Wachovia Corporation in Winston-Salem, N.C., were beneficiaries while weaker banks were suffering.
According to Mr. Salem's survey, corporate treasurers are identifying as weak some of the country's largest banks, including Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical Banking and Chase Manhattan. First Interstate, based in Los Angeles, the Bank of Boston and Continental Bank, Chicago, were also frequently cited. Citicorp, by far the largest banking company in the country, gets mixed reviews and is frequently listed both as one of the strongest and one of the weakest banks.
 
 Trouble in New York
 Recent loan losses at the four New York banks have caused their ratings to decline, but the banks are not so weak that the best-known industry experts say they are likely to fail.
The basic information used by all analysts are the quarterly "call reports," which every bank is required to provide to Federal regulators, who use the data and also sell the computer tapes to the public for about $600 a quarter.
Using the information about loans, capital and earnings, analysts develop ratings based on a variety of measurements and assumptions. For example, if a bank has shareholder capital equal to less than 3 percent of total assets, it is a sign of weakness. Capital, or the amount by which a bank's assets exceed its deposits and other money it owes to creditors, is a crucial indicator of health because it is a measure of how thick a cushion the bank has to absorb future losses.
 
 When Trouble Is Serious
 If a bank with weak capital has also reported a loss in the last year, anlaysts will assign it a still lower rating. And if that bank also has an unusually high level of delinquent loans that are likely to result in still more losses, it is likely to earn a rating that would suggest failure is a strong possibility. Analysts say a bank is seriously troubled when 10 percent of its assets are delinquent.
Although most of the rating agencies use copyright law to prevent newspapers and others from publishing their ratings, their conclusions are widely known among corporate treasurers and others who pay for their service.
But as bank problems worsen and more individuals and small businesses become concerned, some rating agencies are adjusting their policy to disseminate their ratings more widely.
Ferguson & Company, for example, a Washington, D.C., rating firm, is considering starting a "900" telephone service to provide ratings for a small fee, according to Simon Davidson, director of marketing.
Thomson Bankwatch Inc. a New York rating agency, has decided to make its ratings publicly available later this month.
Veribank has an "800" telephone number through which callers can request a single bank rating for as little as $10 for the first bank and $3 for each additonal rating.
Among other bank rating firms are Sheshunoff Information Services Inc., based in Austin, Tex., and the Bauer Group, based in Coral Gables, Fla.

HEADLINE: Religion Notes

BYLINE: By Ari L. Goldman

 BODY:

In Religion We Trust
Americans have far more faith in religion than politics as a vehicle for solving community problems, a new Gallup poll has found.
The survey, conducted in early November, asked 1,025 adults around the country to rate the ability of various institutions to act effectively on the local level. Churches, synagogues and other religious organizations headed the list, with 57 percent; political parties were at the bottom, with about 15 percent.
In between, in descending order of confidence expressed, were volunteer groups, schools, the local news media, local business, local government, state government, the Federal Government and national business.
The survey, conducted by telephone Nov. 6-9, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. Its results appeared in the December newsletter of the Princeton Religion Center, an affiliate of the Gallup organization in Princeton, N.J.
Women were more inclined than men to place their trust in religious institutions (65 percent to 48 percent), and adults under the age of 30 less inclined than those over 30 (52 percent to 60 percent).
At the same time, young people tended to show higher confidence than their elders in all other institutions listed in the survey.
"This could suggest that the initial impulse of people when they are young is to seek solutions from secular institutions," the report said, "but later in life they can be expected to turn more to the church to channel their voluntary instincts to serve the community."
 
A Surfeit of Reaction
A weekly column by the Rev. Richard P. McBrien, a liberal theologian at the University of Notre Dame who has frequently challenged the Vatican on various issues, has been dropped by The Brooklyn Tablet, the newspaper of the Roman Catholic diocese that comprises Brooklyn and Queens.
Ed Wilkinson, editor of The Tablet, said he had stopped running the nationally syndicated column because Bishop Thomas V. Daily of Brooklyn, who heads the diocese and is the publisher of The Tablet, "didn't want it in the paper anymore."
Mr. Wilkinson said Bishop Daily had complained that Father McBrien "shows too much disrespect for the Holy Father." The Bishop also discontinued the McBrien column when he was head of his previous diocese, in Palm Beach, Fla.
In November, when controversy over the McBrien column first appeared in the Brooklyn Diocese, Mr. Wilkinson said that he might not always agree with what Father McBrien had to say but noted that the theologian "gets a lot of reaction."
Asked about that comment yesterday, Mr. Wilkinson said, "I guess he got too much reaction."
A spokesman for Bishop Daily said the cleric was out of the country and unavailable for comment.
In his most recent column, which Tablet readers never saw, Father McBrien had a "wish list" that included this: "Wouldn't it be wonderful if in 1991 Catholic newspaper editors and publishers were to recognize that the Church's capacity to teach with credibility is harmed, not helped, by the suppression of opinion columns with which they are personally uncomfortable?"
 
Jews Reach Out
In an effort to attract young people, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, which comprises 800 Reform synagogues, has announced a plan to reduce or eliminate synagogue dues for young, unaffiliated Jews.
In making the announcement earlier this week, Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, the president of the organization, said the unaffiliated "are the fastest growing group in the American Jewish community." He cited statistics showing that more than 50 percent of the nation's 5.8 million Jews do not belong to synagogues or temples.
Many synagogues charge from $500 to $1,000 a year in dues, which usually includes sanctuary seats for the High Holy Days of Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur. Under the new plan, unaffiliated Jews from 22 to 30 years of age would be issued "privilege cards" that would enable them to join a Reform congregation at little or no cost for up to two years. In addition, college students would be issued "access cards" granting them free seats for High Holy Day services and other congregational events.
Rabbi Jerome Epstein, executive vice president of United Synagogue, said his group, which represents Conservative congregations, tried a similar program of free and reduced-cost membership 20 years ago.
"It didn't work," Rabbi Epstein said. "The congregations brought people in but didn't do anything to engage them in synagogue life."
Still, he said, he would carefully watch the Reform program, "Just because it didn't work then doesn't mean it won't work now," he said.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 2.73 Points After a Slow Session

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks edged ahead yesterday for their second consecutive gain, but activity continued to be extremely light.
Practically all of the gain in the Dow Jones industrial average came from Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, the producer of Scotch tape, which rose 2, to 81 5/8. It said it had invested in Forstmann Little & Company, the leveraged buyout firm. 
 Many traders headed for home shortly after noon as a big snowstorm moved into the New York area. Activity had been sluggish anyway as traders hesitated to act before today's talks in Baghdad between Javier Perez de Cuellar, the Secretary General of the United Nations, and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
 
 'A Little Bit' Positive
 "I thought it was a surprisingly good day, given the lack of activity and the apprehension," said Laszlo Birinyi, president of the research firm of Birinyi Associates. "I wouldn't have been surprised if the market had dropped 20 points, given the apparent stalemate in the Middle East. And the fact that the market came back on a Friday afternoon when a lot of people were leaving early was a little bit of a positive sign."
Most of those active in the market yesterday were day traders -- people who buy in the morning and sell before the day ends to avoid exposure in the event of some unforeseen development over the weekend.
The Dow, which rose 28.46 points on Thursday, tacked on 2.73 more yesterday, to bring the blue-chip index to 2,501.49. It was only the second advance in the Dow this year, after six straight declines. The Dow lost 64.60 points for the week.
Activity slid to 123.1 million shares, from 124.5 million the day before.
 
 2 Crucial Factors
 The crisis in the Middle East and the price of crude oil have practically replaced economic developments in shaping the thinking of investors. Traders contended that yesterday's report on the Producer Price Index -- showing that wholesale prices dropped six-tenths of 1 percent in December, more than economists had expected -- should have pushed bond prices higher.
They argued that with inflation subsiding, as the December figures showed, the Federal Reserve might more readily cut interest rates without fear of overheating the economy. But bonds fell, followed by stocks, although both came back a little toward the end of the day, with the Dow closing at a slight gain and bonds showing a small loss.
In one of the day's biggest moves, Motorola headed the Big Board active list, falling 2 3/4, to 47 3/4, with 2.8 million shares changing hands. Thomas Kurlak, a Merrill Lynch analyst, downgraded the stock and cut his earnings estimate in anticipation of weaker cellular phone business. Motorola fell to a new low of 47 before bouncing back.
 
 Oil-Service Stocks Fall
 Baker Hughes slid 1 1/4, to 21 5/8, on 2.5 million shares after the oil-service company said the Justice Department had subpoenaed it and unidentified others for price data. The stock reached a new low of 20 3/4 yesterday before recovering.
Dresser Industries, saying it had been subpoenaed for information on drill-bit prices but had no indication it was the target of an investigation, rose 1/4, to 19 3/8.
Among other active stocks in the oil-service group, Schlumberger fell 1/2, to 51 1/2; Halliburton was off 3/8, to 41 1/8, and McDermott International was down 3/8, to 21 3/4. Rowan, which hit a new low during the day of 9, ended down 3/8, to 9 1/8, on 1.1 million shares.
Household International, which owns Household Finance, rose 1 3/8, to 30, after forecasting record earnings for 1990 and 1991.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Fell Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Reflecting a sharp decline in energy prices and the inflation-dampening effects of recession, prices paid to American producers fell six-tenths of 1 percent in December, the first decline since April, the Labor Department reported today.
The drop, also the biggest since mid-1986, pulled the advance for the year in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods back to 5.6 percent -- or 3.2 percent when the gyrating energy component is excluded. 
 Today's report, which was somewhat better than most economists had been expecting, benefited from the first decline in oil prices since June and the first drop in food since September. But it also underscored the difficulty faced by producers seeking to raise prices in a slumping economy.
 
 'Weak Demand'
 "There's very weak demand out there, and companies are finding it hard to pass along price hikes," said Micheal W. Casey, an economist at Maria Ramirez Capital Consultants. "The economy's pretty clearly in recession."
"The producer price figures confirm what our members, the wholesaler-distributors who pay these prices, are telling us," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. "The economy is too weak to sustain such broad-based price increases."
While the overall finished goods index was down last month, the core inflation for the Producer Price Index, which excludes food and energy, was up, but just three-tenths of 1 percent for the month and 3.5 percent for 1990, a performance that analysts said should reassure the Federal Reserve as it considers further cuts in interest rates to arrest the economy's decline.
 
Little Inflation Pressure Seen
 In its inflation report, the Department also said that prices at the intermediate and crude stages of production fell last month, by nine-tenths of 1 percent and 5.4 percent, respectively. This suggested little inflation pressure ahead for the finished-goods index, which tallies prices of those goods, like a dress, that are ready for sale to the final business user or consumer.
Comparable intermediate and crude items would be a bolt of cloth and a bale of cotton.
For all of 1990, the 5.6 percent increase in the finished goods index compared with 4.9 percent for 1989 and was the highest since 1981's 7.1 percent jump. Intermediate goods climbed 4.3 percent last year, nearly twice as much as in 1989, but crude goods' rise of 6 percent was down from 1989's 7.1 percent.
The small rise last month in core inflation was mainly attributed to automobiles and tobacco. But analysts observed that cars, selling slowly these days, were an unlikely source of sustained price increases. In tobacco, soaring exports have been a big factor in driving prices up.
On the other hand, the producer price indexes do not include imported goods, which are being made relatively more expensive here by the dollar's weakness in world currency markets.
December's Consumer Price Index, which includes imports and far more services than the Producer Price Index, is to be published on Wednesday. Prices at the producer level generally feed through to the consumer with a lag of several months. The consumer prices report for December, is expected to show a modest increase of perhaps two-tenths of a percent.
The six-tenths of 1 percent decline in December's finished-goods index -- which followed four months of increases averaging more than 1 percent -- had little effect on the markets. This, analysts said, was because rumors of a favorable report had prompted bond buying on Thursday, depressing interest rates then.
Finished energy goods tumbled 4.8 percent, after changing negligibly in November and rocketing 34.1 percent in the August-October period, which occurred before the lost Persian Gulf production was fully replaced.
 
Vegetable Prices Drop
 The sharp downturn in food prices, was paced by fresh and dried vegetables, pork and roasted coffee. Processed turkeys dropped more than 15 percent and dairy products fell for the fourth straight month.
Tobacco rose four-tenths of 1 percent after a 3.7 percent November jump, and the increase for automobiles was halved, to nine-tenths of 1 percent. Women's apparel fell 1.1 percent, much more than in November, but increases accelerated for prescription drugs, cosmetics and light trucks and household appliances turned up after falling in November.
Finished capital equipment rose four-tenths of 1 percent, twice the November increase, the Labor Department also reported.
Among intermediate goods, energy dropped 5.5 percent while nondurable materials used in manufacturing turned down, by two-tenths of 1 percent, after three straight sizable advances. Durable manufacturing materials, which fell 1 percent in November, dropped another 1.2 percent last month.
In addition to petrochemicals, prices turned lower for paperboard, paint and fertilizer materials, and also fell for aluminum mill shapes, copper and brass mill shapes, primary lead and copper and aluminum extrusion billets.
In crude goods, energy materials dropped a record 10.7 percent, but foods and feeds fell just one-tenth of 1 percent compared with November's 1.7 percent drop. The price of fresh vegetables turned down, and increases for fresh fruit slowed, but the December survey was taken before the California freeze and thus the price effects of extensive crop damage will not show up until the January report.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Gorbachev Seeking a Way Out in Gulf

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev set off a round of Soviet-American consultations today by offering President Bush new proposals about ending the Persian Gulf crisis. But the White House said Mr. Gorbachev presented "nothing that looks like a breakthrough."
After an unexpected 8 A.M. telephone call from Moscow, Mr. Bush told reporters that Mr. Gorbachev was "thinking innovatively" about how to get Iraq out of Kuwait without war. He met twice with Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, the Soviet Ambassador to Washington, during the day to discuss the Soviet President's proposals. 
 Mr. Bush and his aides refused to give details on Mr. Gorbachev's suggestions. But they suggested that they focused on finding a new way to offer President Saddam Hussein of Iraq some enticement to leave Kuwait without having that appear to be a step back from the United Nations' demand for a complete and unconditional withdrawal.
 
Little Hope Seen
 Administration officials said they were taking Mr. Gorbachev's suggestions seriously, but held out little hope that what the Soviet leader outlined was different enough from earlier attempts at a diplomatic solution that Moscow's ideas might signal real progress toward a peaceful settlement.
"There's nothing that looks like a breakthrough," said Marlin Fitzwater, Mr. Bush's spokesman, adding that the White House was anxious "not to get anyone's hopes up."
Mr. Gorbachev's telephone call provided an unexpected note of drama to a day that was devoted primarily to lining up Congressional backing for a resolution that would endorse Mr. Bush's policy in the Persian Gulf and give him authority to use force against Iraq if necessary.
Mr. Bush made the votes in the House and Senate a matter of personal loyalty, as well as national security, in meetings and telephone calls to wavering members of Congress, especially in the Senate, where the White House was most concerned about losing what it has increasingly come to see as a critical test of domestic political support.
Administration aides acknowledged that the White House had to scale back its hopes for a large margin of victory in the Senate as a number of key moderates opposed Mr. Bush's position, includin Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, and David L. Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who heads the Select Committee on Intelligence.
 
'Twisted Our Arms'
 "Those moves really twisted our arms, since a lot of moderate Democrats fell in behind them,' said a senior Administration official. "Everyone feels that if we get a big margin in the House, any margin in the Senate is fine. We'll have made our point and the President will be free to do anything that he wants."
Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, said, "At one time, they were worried that a close vote like that would be a sign that we were sharply divided and send the wrong message to Saddam Hussein. But I think they've come around to thinking that a victory is a victory."
Just as the White House tried to put the best face on what promised to be at best a slim victory on the vote in the Senate, Administration officials also tried to keep control of the flurry of speculation prompted by Mr. Gorbachev's telephone call.
Mr. Bush himself stressed that he and Mr. Gorbachev were "in sync" on their policy toward the gulf. "They are absolutely convinced that Saddam Hussein should get out of Kuwait in total compliance with the U.N. resolutions" that demand Iraq's withdrawal by Jan. 15, Mr. Bush said.
He said that Mr. Gorbachev, who has argued at times that economic sanctions be given more time to work, did not make that case in the telephone call today. But he said the Soviet leader had mentioned "some ideas" about solving the crisis without war.
"We are leaving no stone unturned to try to find a peaceful solution of this question," Mr. Bush said.
Mr. Fitzwater told his daily news briefing that Mr. Gorbachev asked Mr. Bush to meet with Mr. Bessmertnykh. Later, he said the two had met twice and that the Soviet envoy "wanted to flesh out these ideas a bit more."
He said that the Administration has been expecting a flurry of diplomatic activity as the Jan. 15 deadline approaches.
"There are a lot of people with different ideas," he said, that focus mainly on how to approach the idea of holding an international conference, or how to deal with Iraq after a withdrawal, or about the future of Kuwait once its deposed government was restored.
"But basically, they're all within the same parameters of unconditionally requiring Saddam to pull out by Jan. 15," he said. "Within that parameter, it's hard to give any hope or credence to these ideas since Saddam has shown no interest in any number of formulations before."

HEADLINE: How Harsh Will the Recession Be? Most Experts Forecast a Mild One

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
There is no dearth of intrepid economists who forecast that the recession will be brief and mild, as these things go. In fact, that is the predominant view of leading analysts. But economic predictions, which are inherently risky, are particularly hazardous now, with new cracks showing in the nation's financial structure and increasing fear of war in the Persian Gulf.
The conventional view of economic forecasters and the White House is that the worst is already over and that the economy will begin to recover in the spring or summer. 
 Morgan Stanley & Company's chief economist, John D. Paulus, espouses this view, and points to, among other things, a lack of a big inventory buildup. Unlike in most recessions, that means smaller piles of cars, appliances and clothing that need to be sold before companies order new merchandise and reorder supplies.
 
'Short and Shallow'
 He and others also noted a clear trend toward lower interest rates, which should help restore the consumer's ability to buy, and a general confidence in the economy. A decline in the prices paid to American producers in December, the first drop reported by the Government since April, should help keep the path clear for further cuts in rates. [Page 31.]
Looking at these and other factors, Mr. Paulus said, the recession is "likely to be short and shallow," which to him would be a 1.75 percent decline in the total output of goods and services from the peak of economic growth to the lowest point. If he and those who agree with him are right, this recession would be less than half as severe as those of 1981-82 and 1974-75, the worst in the postwar period.
On average, postwar recessions have lasted 11 months, during which the total output of goods and services fell about 2.25 percent from peaks to troughs.
But a substantial group of economists and business people are more pessimistic about the length and depth of this recession. They point to the extremely high debt of American families, businesses and governments and a financial and banking system more fragile than at any time since the 1930's.
There is time for either group to be right, depending on several factors.
For one thing, it is hard to forecast the recession's end when no one yet knows when it started. The best guess by non-Government economists is that it began between the Fourth of July and Halloween, though some say earlier. The National Bureau of Economic Research, charged with dating business cycles, has not made a formal decision, although it issued a statement last month that a recession probably began in the summer.
 
This One's Different
 More significant is that the cause of this recession, and thus its dominant features, seem markedly different from those of previous recessions. Typically, recessions in the last 45 years started out with rapid price inflation, tight money and high interest rates, followed by high inventories of unsold merchandise.
This time interest rates have been going down, spending has not dropped rapidly and businesses have reported relatively low inventories. A faster recovery from recession should result, theoretically.
Then there is the not-so-small matter of possible war in the Persian Gulf. If that happens, it creates more uncertainty not only about oil prices but also about the United States and world economies and about public and business psychology. The run-up in crude-oil prices after Iraq invaded Kuwait last August is tied to a loss of consumer confidence in the economy that many experts say pushed the tottering economy over the edge into a recession.
"It is very early and very difficult to tell how long and how severe this recession will be," said Victor Zarnowitz, speaking for himself as an economics professor at the University of Chicago and not as a member of the National Bureau of Economic Research. He said that in the last month, expectations have dropped sharply about the economy's performance in the fourth quarter of 1990. First estimates, due on Jan. 25, could show that the gross national product may have fallen as much as 4 percent at an annual rate, he said.
 
Net Worth Is Down
 The more pessimistic group of forecasters contends that this recession is more worrisome, perhaps substantially so, even without a war with Iraq.
These economists maintain that rather than well-controlled inventories and falling interest rates, what really distinguishes the early stages of this recession is that in many ways the net worth of individuals and corporations is declining because of a combination of high debts and lower values of property and other assets.
"This cycle differs from others in the postwar era," said M. Kathryn Eickhoff, a New York consultant who was formerly chief economist for the Office of Management and Budget, "by the amount of debt creation that preceded it and the extent to which falling prices of assets are a major factor." She contrasted the situation to the ebb and flow of cyclical economic forces like inventories.
"This is a balance sheet recession, Ms. Eickhoff said. "The others primarily affected the income statement."
She and others sharing her view say that a major factor is the decline in home prices and that the drop is just now hitting the Midwest as it has the Northeast and California. Given that big sections of the nation are just beginning to feel that particular pain, the confidence of millions of more consumers is expected to be undermined.
 
Real Estate Values Shrink
 "Families do not know what they're worth," said Roger M. Kubarych, a former Federal Reserve economist who now works for Henry Kaufman & Company. "People all over the country are selling houses for 75 percent of what they thought" they would get.
In some cases, especially in commercial real estate, values have plunged below the mortgage balance, threatening the lender as well as wiping out equity.
"We have built up a superstructure of financial claims that far exceeds the value of underlying real assets," said John E. Silvia, economist for Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago. "The boom and excesses of the 1980's have been financial, not industrial, and the correction must also be financial," he said.
Others said it was troublesome that corporations have little cash on hand as well as shrinking profits, and use, on average, almost 60 percent of their earnings just to pay interest, about twice the proportion of a decade ago.
Looming behind the economic considerations is the possibility of a Middle East war, one that it is widely assumed would be short-lived and lead to a drop in oil prices and a stimulus for the economy.
But, Administration assurances to the contrary, there is no guarantee that oil from Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf sources would continue to flow without interruption and at low prices, even after a war ended.
Even if a prolonged Middle East conflict is avoided, many believe that anything other than a peaceful resolution of the crisis could be highly disruptive to the economy. "In the event of a war in the Persian Gulf," economists for Lloyds Bank say, "the price of oil could surge to $40 per barrel or higher, thereby obsoleting most economic forecasts for major industrial countries."
Still, if the length and severity of anything is harder to call than a recession, it is a war: At the beginning of the Civil War, President Lincoln was advised it would last no more than 90 days.

HEADLINE: Emergency Oil Release Plan Is Set

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The International Energy Agency, a 21-nation group of oil-importing nations, adopted an emergency plan today to bolster oil supplies by releasing two million barrels a day from government reserves if war begins in the Persian Gulf.
The decision -- the first time the Paris-based agency has adopted an emergency contingency plan -- was welcomed by petroleum experts, who said it would help to moderate prices and keep supply and demand in balance in the event of a gulf war. 
 Although the 2 million barrels represent a small fraction of the 54 million barrels consumed worldwide each day, oil analysts said the emergency plan would help calm oil markets if war erupted. Agency officials declined to disclose how much each member country would contribute.
 
 'Will Reassure Markets'
 "It's a very good plan because it will reassure the markets that there is an additional availability," said Robert Mabro, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in England. "It's bound to have a dampening effect on prices."
He added that the two million barrels a day to be released from emergency government reserves "is enough at this stage, but they might have to do more later on."
Under the decision, the agency's executive director, Helga Steeg, would order the plan into effect as soon as she learned that war had broken out. Under the plan, which seeks to act "in anticipation of any possible temporary shortfall in oil supplies," the additional oil would become available 15 days after Dr. Steeg activated the plan.
The plan also calls for freeing an additional 500,000 barrels a day by putting conservation measures in place, having power plants switch from oil to other fuels, and using the little spare oil production capacity left in the world.
 
 Established After Embargo
 Oil-importing nations set up the International Energy Agency in 1974 after Arab nations embargoed oil shipments to the United States. The agency -- which includes the United States, Japan and most Western European nations -- aims to coordinate a response to any oil-supply emergency, encourage conservation and promote l long-term balance in splply and demand.
According to the agency, oil stocks in the industrialized Western nations are at a comfortable level of 3.6 billion barrels.
Industry officials said they could only guess to what extent supplies would be impaired by war. Some say the effect will be minimal, while others fear there could be serious disruptions if Iraq manages to destroy Saudi oilfields or if the war seriously disrupts shipping in the gulf.
"No one knows what the shortfall will be," Dr. Steeg said.
 
 Supplies Exceed Demand
 The agency's decision comes at a time when oil supplies slightly exceed demand despite the embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August, many oil experts predicted a serious shortfall because of the loss of 4 million barrels a day. The current surplus in supply resulted from a big increase of Saudi output and a decline in consumption resulting from higher prices and an economic slowdown.
"The market is very well supplied right now," said Peter Bogin, an oil analyst in the Paris office of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "If you release another two milion barrels a day, your objective isn't to keep the market supplied. Your objective is to moderate the price. That represents a shift in attitude for the I.E.A."
The agency has been criticized for being slow to draw down emergency government reserves. After Iraq invaded Kuwait, many industry analysts said it should have approved the release of emergency reserves to prevent oil prices from soaring.
Agency officials have long said that it is not their business to manipulate the world's oil prices, but to insure that oil needs are met.

HEADLINE: Seidman Is Hopeful on Boston Bank

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOSTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
L. William Seidman said today that he hoped the Bank of New England would be sold in three to four months and added that several more potential buyers had emerged.
In a quick visit to the scene of the action, Mr. Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, declined to identify the possible buyers, but did say that about a half-dozen large and responsible organizations had expressed interest. So far, BankAmerica of San Francisco and Banc One of Columbus, Ohio, have said they are considering an acquisition of Bank of New England, the region's third-largest bank, which is now in the hands of Federal regulators. 
 The F.D.I.C. will most likely set a schedule requiring all bidders to submit their offers within two or three months and would like to select a buyer within a month after that, Mr. Seidman told reporters at a breakfast news conference here. He said he wanted to make the bidding process "as short as possible to move the bank into private hands as soon as possible."
The Bank of New England was seized Sunday in a rescue that is likely to cost the Federal insurance fund up to $2.3 billion, making it one of the costliest bailouts ever. Federal officials acted just days after the bank, which has operations in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Maine, said it expected a huge loss that would leave it unable to absorb future losses and depositors reacted by quickly withdrawing about $1 billion. The deposit drain ended when regulators stepped in to take control and assured that all bank deposits would be protected, even those that exceeded $100,000, the amount guaranteed by the bank insurance fund.
Mr. Seidman also met yesterday with Bank of New England executives and assured them that the management team put in place shortly before the bank failed would stay on during the transition period. He also met with executives of the much smaller Capitol Bank and Trust Company, a Medford, Mass. bank that failed last month, as well as F.D.I.C. employees.
In addition, Mr. Seidman met with the Governors of the New England states in a lunch meeting at the Massachusetts State House. The meeting was at the invitation of Gov. William Weld of Massachusetts, but included the region's five other Governors.
The purpose of the meeting was strictly informational, Mr. Seidman said.
"My message to the Governors is that we are interested in the stability of the financial system and credit availability in your area," Mr. Seidman said. At the State House lunch, the group discussed the region's credit squeeze and the collapse of several regional banks, a spokesman for Governor Weld said. At that meeting, Mr. Seidman also repeated a proposal he presented to Congress earlier this week to set up a fund that would make investments in troubled banks to avert any capital and liquidity problems.
The Governor's spokesman said Mr. Seidman was praised by the Governors for his agency's quick action in taking over the Bank of New England. "The was a sense of disturbance on Saturday and then calm on Monday once the regulators stepped in," said Jordan St. John, the spokesman.
In questioning, Mr. Seidman declined to identify whether any other regional banks would need Federal assistance. Banks in New England have been hard hit by a real estate recession that follows several years of lending to risky real estate development projects. In addition, an overall reluctance by any investors to back projects in this region has made it difficult for banks to restructure and recapitalize troubled real estate portoflios.
"We want to restore confidence to this area as a whole and to provide capital to banks that are capital-short," Mr. Seidman said. This plan, which is being discussed in Washington, would draw capital from the private sector as well as from increased assessments on banks in the Federal insurance fund. This money would be used to make capital infusion into shaky banks.

The Economy
A brief, mild recession? That's the predominant view, but making economic predictions seems particularly hazardous these days. The conventional wisdom, subscribed to by the White House, is that the worst is over, and numbers abound to support that view. But pessimists point to the extremely high debt of American families, businesses and governments and a banking system more fragile than at any time since the 1930's. [Page 1.]
Prices paid to American producers fell 0.6 percent in December, the first decline since April, the Labor Department reported. The decline, the biggest since 1986, pulled the advance for the year back to 5.6 percent, or 3.2 percent when the gyrating energy component is excluded. [31.]
Seidman said he hoped the Bank of New England would be sold in three to four months. On a visit to the scene of the action in Boston, he added that several more potential buyers had emerged. [31.]
No single statistic can foretell which banks will fail, but from the welter of financial reports banks issue, government and private analysts can glean strong hints about which are the shakiest. While most bank failures involve small institutions, analysts say some large banks are in serious trouble. [31.]
U.S. oil consumption fell in 1990, the first year-to-year drop in seven years, driven by war fears, recession and the weather, the American Petroleum Institute said. Domestic oil production fell to its lowest level since 1961. [31.]
The International Energy Agency adopted an emergency plan to bolster oil supplies by releasing two million barrels a day from government reserves if war begins in the Persian Gulf. [31.]
A judge dismissed 12 fraud counts against Keating and three Lincoln associates, citing technical problems with amended charges filed by the prosecution, but left 34 counts intact. [33.]
 
Companies
The talk of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas has been the increasingly likely war between Sony's and Philips' versions of the new generation of cassette recorder. [31.]
Pan Am got access to $50 million of the $150 million loan that was authorized by a bankruptcy judge. The money, from a bridge loan arranged by Bankers Trust and United Airlines, is aimed at keeping Pan Am flying until it can complete the sale of its London routes to United. [32.]
A judge shaved $36 million off Polaroid's award in its patent infringement suit against Kodak. The original award had been $909.4 million, considerably less than the $1.5 billion to $2 billion many analysts had expected. [33.]
 
 Markets
Stocks edged ahead for their second straight gain, but activity continued to be extremely light. The Dow rose 2.73 points, to 2,501.49, but for the week it lost 64.60. [34.]
A rally late in the day helped long-term Treasury securities erase a good part of their earlier losses. [34.]
The dollar finished mixed in subdued trading, as investors awaited Mideast developments. Gold prices advanced. [40.]
Oil prices fell in slow action as traders drew their breath and waited for Persian Gulf news. Crude fell 42 cents, to $27.29. The week's gain was $2.39. [40.]

Many loyal employees who hold company stock have seen their nest eggs cracked in bankruptcies. Your Money. [32.]

The Congress finds that the Constitution of the United States vests all power to declare war in the Congress of the United States. Any offensive action taken against Iraq must be explicitly approved by the Congress of the United States before such action may be initiated.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: BAKER WARNS OF FAST STRIKE IF KUWAIT DEADLINE PASSES: SUPPORT IN CONGRESS IS SEEN;
Slim Senate Majority Is Expected But House Backing Appears Solid

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
After a second day of sober debate, Congress appears ready to vote over the weekend to give President Bush the authority to go to war against Iraq.
A solid margin of support is expected in the House, where votes are scheduled by early Saturday afternoon, but the outlook in the Senate is for only a bare victory. Voting there is scheduled to be held on Saturday as well. 
 By nightfall, more than 200 members of Congress had taken the floor to speak either in favor of giving Mr. Bush the authority to attack if Iraq has not withdrawn from Kuwait by Tuesday or of continued reliance on economic sanctions as the better policy.
 
'The Voices of Democracy'
 A key speech favoring the sanctions approach was delivered by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, whose influential opposition to using force has now appeared to swing votes.
But he said he thought his side would lose and concluded by warning Iraq: "These are the voices of democracy. Don't misread this debate. If war occurs, the constitutional and policy debates will be suspended, and Congress will provide the American troops whatever they need to prevail. There will be no cutoff of funds for our troops while they engage your forces on the field of battle." [Sampling from speeches and excerpts from resolutions, pages 6 and 7.]
Mr. Bush, lobbying about 100 House members at a White House breakfast, said that "the last, best chance for Saddam Hussein to get the message is in your hands," said Marlin Fitzwater, his spokesman.
The debate also had moments of intense emotion. Representative Craig Thomas, Republican of Wyoming, insisted that for weeks "Congress has dodged this important vote." He said, "The President needs our support -- 400,000 servicemen need our support."
But Representative Andrew Jacobs Jr., Democrat of Indiana, said: "Must we all believe that we're playing Rambo, that we're playing war games here? It's forever. It's total war for the kid who gets blown away."
There was also one brief angry moment in the Senate gallery when about a dozen demonstrators interrupted Mr. Nunn's speech to shout antiwar slogans like "No Blood for Oil!" and "No War for Bush!"
Capitol policemen dragged them from the gallery and 11 were arrested and charged with disruption of Congress. Senator Donald W. Riegle, Democrat of Michigan, said, "While I condemn that kind of outburst, it is a sign of things to come."
 
2 Competing Resolutions
 Aside from the speeches, in which one lawmaker after another -- more than 200 by nightfall -- announced his or her intentions, most of the activity went on behind closed Senate doors. Republicans, and a few Democrats, including Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, worked hard at lining up votes to authorize Mr. Bush to use military force.
Only when it appeared that they had assembled a majority did they introduce their proposal in the Senate, copying it word for word from the House measure offered on Thursday that cited Iraq's offenses in Kuwait and warned that its "chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs" threatened world peace.
But even then, the President's supporters had appeared to line up nothing close to the 60 votes Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, had forecast on Sunday.
With the issue down to two competing resolutions, one favoring force in accordance with the United Nations resolution demanding an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait by Jan. 15 and the other calling for continued reliance on sanctions but promising fast action if the President again asked for the use of force, it appeared that Mr. Bush had 51 to 53 senators prepared to authorize force.
 
99 Senators Expected to Vote
 Of the 44 Republicans in the Senate, only the votes of Senators Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa were in doubt. Neither has publicly committed either way.
But even if both deserted Mr. Bush, Democratic support would more than make up the difference. In addition to Mr. Lieberman, who announced his decision by saying "Our final, last chance for a truly peaceful end to this crisis is to send a clear, unequivocal message to Saddam Hussein," these eight Democrats said today that they would support using force: Senators John B. Breaux of Louisiana, Richard H. Bryan of Nevada, Bob Graham of Florida, Howell Heflin of Alabama, J. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Harry Reid of Nevada, Charles S. Robb of Virginia and Richard C. Shelby of Alabama.
Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, is undergoing cancer treatments and will not be here to vote but the other 99 senators are expected to vote.
In the House, there will be votes on three resolutions -- a declaration asserting Congress's sole power to declare war and a pair of resolutions, like those in the Senate, favoring continued reliance on sanctions and authorizing the use of force.
 
Bush's Spurned Efforts
 Congressmen on both sides of the issue predicted first an easy victory for the resolution asserting congressional prerogatives, and then a victory by 230 to 240 votes of the 435 in the House for the side urging the authorization of the use of military force in the Persian Gulf.
Today's House debate focused repeatedly on the issue of how long economic sanctions and diplomacy should be tried as a lever to force Iraq from Kuwait. Representative William S. Broomfield, the senior Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee, argued that "a look at the record shows that the President has done all he can to find a peaceful solution."
He said President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had spurned Mr. Bush's efforts, and, "It is now time for Congress to make the Iraqi leader understand that America stands behind the President, and that his recent letter was not an idle threat but a credible warning."
But Representative Gerry E. Studds, Democrat of Massachusetts, argued: "Our choice today is whether to persevere on the path of patience and determination and peace or to stray from that path into the wilderness of war. Whether to walk together the extra mile or the extra two miles in pursuit of a bloodless resolution to this crisis or to declare war and fight war and count the bodies and bury the bodies and never know whether a single American soldier really had to die."
 
Major Statement by Nunn
 Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia, argued that sanctions would fall away if the resolution authorizing force was defeated, "for in the eyes of the world, Saddam will have won." Then, he said, "the road to Baghdad will be jammed with diplomats cutting a deal, supplying him with whatever he needs."
Mr. Nunn's speech was a major statement in the long Senate day. He argued that the nation too often identified its foreign interests as vital, without thinking through the consequences.
"We throw around the word 'vital' very carelessly," he said. "When politicians declare an interest to be vital, our men and women in uniform are expected to put their lives at risk to defend that interest."
He argued that "on balance there is a reasonable expectation that continued economic sanctions backed up by the threat of military force and international isolation can bring about Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait."
 
'A Succession of Dictators'
 "I believe that the risk associated with continued emphasis on sanctions are considerably less than the very real risk associated with war and, most importantly, the aftermath of war in a very volatile region of the world," he continued.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said: "It is clear to me that if we fail to act there will be inevitably a succession of dictators, of Saddam Husseins, of which around the globe there is an abundance. Those dictators will see a green light, a green light or aggression, a green light for annexation of its weaker neigbors."
Senator Bryan, explaining his decision, said other countries had not helped enough with troops or money, but he said it was essential to grant Mr. Bush's request for authority to use military force against Iraq.
"We should not risk the sending of anything less than a unified signal to Saddam Hussein," he said. "The dictator's ability to miscalculate is our greatest danger."
Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts said: "War is not the only option left. Our policy in the Persian Gulf is not broken, and it cannot be fixed by war. There is still time to save the President from himself -- and save thousands of American soldiers in the Persian Gulf from dying in the desert in a war whose cruelty will be exceeded only by the lack of any rational necessity for waging it."

HEADLINE: The Search for a Safer Humidifier

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Health concerns about humidifiers have led several manufacturers to refine older technologies to try to reduce the bacteria and mineral dust they discharge.
The newest design, known as a "wicking" humidifier, updates a process in use for at least 20 years: the evaporation of water to produce a vapor. "Warm mist" humidifiers are being refined, too; they first boil water and then mix the steam with cool air to create a mist. 
 In recent years, Government studies have found that harmful bacteria and molds multiply in the water tanks of humidifiers and are spewed into the air. The studies have raised the possibility that some humidifiers also emit toxic substances like lead and asbestos if they are present in the water that goes into the tank.
Ultrasonic humidifiers, whose popularity peaked in 1987, became a particular focus of public-health concerns, and their sales have suffered. The newer humidifiers represent efforts by manufacturers to restore consumer confidence.
"I expect that the warm-mist market will grow, and the ultrasonic market will diminish," said Brett Gannon, the vice president of finance at Bionaire, a company in Lachine, Quebec, that makes humidifiers and other appliances. Mr. Gannon said Bionaire expects sales of its warm-mist units to surpass those of its ultrasonic models this year.
 
Sound, Mist and Heat
 There are three kinds of humidifiers besides evaporative and warm-mist units: ultrasonic, impeller or cool-mist, and steam. Ultrasonic devices use high-frequency sound to break up water into mist. Cool-mist units do the same thing mechanically. And steam units, as their name implies, make steam by boiling water.
A study completed in 1989 at the Oak Ridge (Tenn.) National Laboratories found that ultrasonic and cool-mist units released the most bacteria, while warm-mist units released insignificant amounts. The study also found that cool-mist units released significant levels of mold.
Some scientists maintain that a strain of bacteria that can be released by humidifiers can cause a respiratory disease similar to pneumonia and that molds from humidifiers can produce allergic reactions.
The new wicking humidifiers are supposed to reduce bacteria, molds and mineral dust, their makers say. In older evaporative models, a belt of sponges passes through water; air is blown across the sponges to dry them and release water vapor. In the newer models, water is drawn up through a paper wick that is supposed to trap bacteria and other contaminants. This wick can be replaced.
"The big problem with the older units was that they were difficult to clean," said Michael Berger, a national sales manager for the Bemis Manufacturing Company in Sheboygan Falls, Wis. Bemis sells wicking humidifiers, as do Sears and the Emerson Electric Company.
The suggested retail prices for Bemis table-top units are $39.95 to $59.95, with larger console-size units costing $79 to $119, Mr. Berger said. Gordon Jones, a Sears spokeman, said console models retail for $89 to $149. Bionaire said its warm-mist humidifers retail for $100 to $165.
Eva Lehman, a toxicologist at the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, said her agency had not studied wicking humidifiers. But she said that evaporative units generally discharge insignificant levels of bacteria. "They emit a fine mist which does not seem to pick up a lot of microbials," she said.
 
Cutting Mineral Dust
 Mineral dust is not believed to reach dangerous levels in vapor from steam, evaporative or warm-mist humidifiers, several health experts said. To reduce mineral-dust emissions from ultrasonic humidifiers, several makers sell demineralization cartridges with their units or offer them as accessories.
There is still some scientific debate over the medical value of humidifiers. But regardless of a humidifier's design, all health authorities urge that it be kept scrupulously clean. And those who maintain that humidifiers can be of value emphasize that they must be properly maintained.
"If there is mold growing in a reservoir, an asthmatic will do himself more harm than good," said Dr. Norman H. Edelman, a professor of pulmonary medicine at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J.
In winter, the relative humidity in a home should be kept at 30 to 50 percent. A level of about 60 percent will lead to indoor condensation and contribute to the growth of mold and bacteria. Hygrometers, which measure indoor humidity, can be bought at many hardware stores.
 
1. SCRUB IT
2. SCRUB IT
 Don't use a humidifier unless you are prepared to take care of it. To reduce the chance of health hazards, the Federal Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends some precautions.
Change the water daily if possible, and clean the water tank vigorously, following the manufacturer's instructions. Consumer Reports recommends using a cleaning solution of an ounce of chlorine bleach to a pint of water; rinse thoroughly with fresh water.
Use distilled or demineralized water in the humidifier to reduce deposits and the release of mineral dust. Use demineralization cartridges or filters if supplied or recommended for your unit.
Drain and clean the tank before storing a humidifier, and dust the unit when taking it out of storage.

HEADLINE: Editorial Notebook;
The Gulf: Postcards From the Edge

BYLINE: KARL E. MEYER

 BODY:
How does the looming showdown in the Persian Gulf look to worried neighbors in South Asia? In a month's travels through India, Pakistan and Nepal, a visiting American learns there is no consensus.
In New Delhi, members of the political elite urge concessions to Iraq to avert a war. In Islamabad, diplomats talk of a new alignment with fundamentalist Iran to contain Saddam Hussein and get badly needed oil at a discount -- and also to show that Pakistan is nobody's lapdog, especially not America's. 
 But in Nepal, a tiny Himalayan kingdom anxious about preserving its own independence from an overbearing India, it looks very different. Immediately on learning Kuwait's fate, Nepal denounced the aggressor and called for collective action against Iraq.
In India and Pakistan, newly installed leaders preside over shaky Governments and foundering economies. And Nepal is about to hold its first multiparty elections in 30 years. Thus self-interest and concern with immediate survival has sent politicians scrambling for lifeboats.
No longer so self-righteous, Indians speak about the costs of a military conflagration. Their overriding worry is that soaring oil prices may wreck hopes for growth in an energy-poor country coping with communal violence.
"The countries most affected by the gulf crisis have been left to fend for themselves," laments The Telegraph of Calcutta. "The only response has come from the International Monetary Fund, but what it is offering is inadequate. India, for instance, will get less than $500 million from the I.M.F., whereas the additional oil burden could be to the tune of $3 to $4 billion."
Indians desperately search for reassuring omens. A senior diplomat who recently visited Baghdad cites the looting of Kuwait as hopeful evidence that Saddam Hussein knows he must yield up his conquests -- otherwise why plunder what Iraq claims it owns? Adding urgency to pleas for a settlement is anxiety about Indian workers trapped in gulf countries, and fear of a backlash among millions of Muslims in India should war erupt.
Pakistan has taken a firmer line against Iraq, even sending a token military force to Saudi Arabia. But nationalism has surged since the suspension in November of U.S. aid to discourage Pakistan's nuclear arms quest. Politicians talk of self-sufficiency, and the press bristles with anti-Americanism. Some commentators even accuse the U.S. of engineering the gulf crisis, citing as evidence the most paranoid of forgeries, the Protocols of Zion.
Estranged from its longtime friends in Washington, Islamabad now seeks friends in Iran and Turkey. A flurry of high-level visits is meant to cement a regional Islamic alliance as a bulwark against Iraq's radical threat. Yet no officials there can say who is in charge in Teheran, and the closer Pakistan moves to Iran, the more it risks angering its Arab benefactors, notably Saudi Arabia.
By contrast, there's nothing convoluted about Nepal's condemnation of Iraq. Independence is the lodestar in Katmandu, where few need reminding of India's absorption in 1975 of a neighboring kingdom, Sikkim. The world's smaller states are plainly united by a bond hardier than ideology, and thicker than oil.

HEADLINE: Flunking World Order 101

BYLINE: By Richard H. Ullman; Richard H. Ullman, professor of international affairs at Princeton University, is author of the forthcoming "Securing Europe."

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
Iraq's intransigence notwithstanding, George Bush is heading toward a C minus or worse in World Order 101, the newest elective course in the foreign policy curriculum.
A passing grade might be generous. It would be based on the President's declaration last August that using force to grab territory simply isn't acceptable, and his success in getting the U.N. to back his message with tough economic sanctions. 
 But Mr. Bush flunked the November midterm when he began to mass forces for a possible American invasion of Iraq. If he continues on his present course, he may well fail the final examination.
The buildup could lead to a failing grade for two reasons. First, it shows that the Administration's proclaimed new world order is remarkably like the old one: The United States still calls the tune and bears the burden. War will begin only if the President so decrees; most of the body bags coming home from the gulf will have Americans in them.
Second, the new order seems to be grounded in the threat of a massive offensive use of force when it should be based on the use of as little force as possible -- and only for defensive purposes.
Mr. Bush's course in world order includes a laboratory exercise: the blockade of Iraq. Not a drop of oil -- Iraq's only important cash crop -- has flowed out of that country. Flowing in are medicines and some foods, not the industrial materials needed to maintain the fighting strength of Iraq's armed forces and to run the modern part of its economy.
The blockade is a crucial experiment, an attempt to compel an aggressor to remove his troops and to repair the damage they have done, and to do so by the steady, measured use of coercive pressure but not -- unless Iraq attacks -- by the use of violence.
The President has declared that his patience with Iraq is wearing thin. But patience is just what is needed for this one or two or even three year experiment to succeed. If Mr. Bush decides to attack, the experiment will be ruined. The world will not learn whether strong economic sanctions, imposed by a nearly united international community, are sufficient to reverse an act of armed aggression.
The experiment matters. The crisis springs from a unique combination of oil, unprovoked aggression and the volatile Middle East. It is difficult to imagine any other circumstances that would lead an American President (let alone any other world leader) to send such a large force halfway around the globe. But it is not difficult -- if the present sanctions work -- to imagine the U.N. Security Council voting to impose a tight embargo against another future aggressor, say a Libyan attempt to take over Chad or a Serbian invasion of Croatia.
The ground rules of the new world order should be plain. The unilateral use of military power to change state borders, to seize economic resources and to right perceived wrongs is unacceptable. Governments that violate these rules will be punished. Punishment will take the form of economic pressure, applied internationally, that would be certain, severe, sustained and enforced -- pressure that would not work tomorrow or the next day, but would work eventually.
The Security Council resolution ordering Iraq to remove its troops from Kuwait by Jan. 15 only permits the use of force; it does not require it. With the hostages out of Iraq, Mr. Bush can justifiably claim that the military buildup has accomplished a vital purpose and he can afford to wait for the economic squeeze to work. But enforcing the blockade will not require the vast array of ships, aircraft and troops currently assembled in the gulf.
Saddam Hussein's rape of Kuwait built the coalition against him. There is no reason to think that, provided its forces on the scene are reduced to sustainable numbers, the coalition will not stay together. If it does, Saddam Hussein will be made to understand that any use of force to break the blockade would bring a devastating international response. He will come to recognize that for Iraq to survive as a modern state, he must totally reverse August's aggression. Patience can make that plain to Saddam Hussein -- and even enable President Bush to salvage an A in World Order 101.

HEADLINE: Africa Suffers From Leadership Problems

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You report that Nigeria's President, Ibrahim Babangida, speaking at a conference in Lagos, called on Western nations to pay compensation to Africa for damage done to the continent by the slave trade (news article, Dec. 24). While no one with a good sense of history will dispute that the slave trade wreaked incalculable havoc on the black race, it is preposterous to blame it for Africa's underdevelopment.
As a Nigerian living in the United States who travels frequently to Africa (I returned from Nigeria on Nov. 21), I have seen more damage done to that continent by incompetent and corrupt leadership than slavery ever did. The African landscape is awash with a class of leadership whose revolutionary songs were about ultimate redemption of the masses. Nevertheless, soon after they establish their rulership, they focus on personal enrichment. When things go wrong and the people start complaining, they resort to blame-the-West syndrome.
Was it the West that supervised the depletion of Nigeria's $100 billion oil fortune, earned between 1970 and 1980? Was it the West that was responsible for diverting much of those earnings to private bank accounts in Switzerland? Perhaps President Babangida should have explained to conference participants why Nigeria's telephone system hardly works?
Or is the West responsible for roads that are never maintained? Or is the West also responsible for the National Electric Power Authority's inability to deliver steady electric services to Nigerian homes?
How could any government that is worth its mettle spend so much time and effort persuading its citizens to learn to live with economic austerity measures only to turn around and sell its crude oil, its single most important source of revenue, at below-market price?
Instead of lavishing our energy on organizing conferences whose sole purpose is cheap self-serving international publicity, our attention should be on the serious problems confronting us. What better reparations can we give ourselves than making genuine efforts to improve our health-care system?
Our hospitals continue to operate at subsistence level; basic drugs are never available, and our doctors and nurses continue to flee to the West for better conditions of service.
Our educational system is far worse than in colonial days, all because of bad policy and neglect. Our judicial system is a joke because of persistent interference by successive rulers. Food is lacking because of bad agricultural policy. Basic transportation and shelter are hardly affordable because of inadequate planning.
Perhaps when we have helped ourselves, we can look to others for reparations.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Day 2: Lawmakers Debate War and More Time for Sanctions

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the debate in Congress today on President Bush's request for support for military action in the Persian Gulf, as transcribed by The New York Times:
 
Senator Bob Graham
Democrat of Florida
I think the past of this, which I will define as that which occurred prior to the invasion of Kuwait, is unfortunately characterized by a failure of strategic vision. Some very basic things are occurring in this region of the world to which we have not been appropriately attentive. Just to cite three, an emerging fundamentalism, not just religious but cultural fundamentalism, the rejection of Western values. This movement of fundamentalism is especially troublesome, as it has attracted such a large number of younger people throughout this region. The enormous disparity between rich and poor, which are fueling basic animosities, and the fact that, in part, through the United States participation, the Middle East has become the parking lot for the military weapons of the world. We end up with a relatively small nation of 15 million people with a 1.3 million army, with 5,700 tanks and over 700 combat aircraft, enormous disproportion of military strength and incredible need for those weapons.
We make a basic mistake, I suggest, if we think that what we are dealing with is one man -- Saddam Hussein. I see Saddam Hussein not as the cause of those fundamental events, but rather as the guileful person who has taken advantage of those and other fundamental factors occurring in this region.
We also, drastically, have contributed to the past. We have accommodated Iraq over a period of more than a decade, accommodated in terms of covertly assisting them in the war with Iran, within the shadow of the invsion of Kuwait, continuing to extend substantial economic assistance to Iraq.
We also have contributed to the past by our failure to have a sustained commitment to a rational national energy policy, failure which has made us increasingly hostage to the circumstances in the Middle East and the personalities of today's and tomorrow's Saddam Husseins.
Looking to the future, I would suggest that as we attempt to assess how we should respond to the current crisis today we should ask ourselves what do we want to have as some of the consequences not just of the next 10 or 60 days, but over the next decade in this region and what do they say about U. S. policy around the world in this new post-cold-war era.
I am going to support the [Mitchell-Nunn] resolution, which will give the President of the United States the authority to use force. I am going to do so because I believe that the President of the United States deserves to have a presumption of correctness of his actions, and that he especially deserves to have a presumption of correctness of his actions, and that he especially deserves to have a presumption of correctness as it relates to matters of our national security and relations with other nations.
 
Senator Sam Nunn
Democrat of Georgia
A sanctions policy is not perfect. No guarantees here. But it has to be weighed against the alternatives.
The Bush Administration is correct when they point out that sanctions do not guarantee that Iraq will leave Kuwait. But the story does not end there. What guarantees do we have that war will be brief? American casualties will be light? No one can say whether war will last five days, five weeks or five months. We know we can win and we will win. No doubt about that. No doubt about who wins this war.
Our policy and our military planning, however, cannot be based on an expectation that the war will be concluded quickly and easily. In large measure the scope and scale of the hostilities, once begun, will be determined by Iraq's willingness to absord massive punishment and to fight on.
 . . .
Mr. President, those who support prompt military action argue that delay will allow Iraq to strengthen its defensive positions in Kuwait, thereby adding to the eventual cost of forcing Iraq out of Kuwait. A couple of observations on this point: This would have been a better argument in September of last year, and October, than it is today.
Iraq already has had five months to dig in and to fortify and they have done so in a major way. Kuwait has fortifications reminiscent of World War I. This argument also overlooks the cost to the Iraqi military of sitting in Kuwait with a 500,000-man force while its logistical support degrades because of the sanctions.
 . . .
Supporters of prompt military action also argue that our offensive military capability will degrade if our huge force sits for months in the Saudi desert. This is also true. And for several months I have suggested that we should institute a policy of unit rotation commencing with quick reaction forces such as the 82d Airborne that might be needed on short notice elsewhere in the world. We should take full advantage of the coalition's superiority in air and sea power while establishing the capability of deploying additional ground forces to the region quickly if needed.
 . . .
In summary, Mr. President, I believe that on balance there is a reasonable expectation that continued economic sanctions backed up by the threat of military force and international isolation can bring about Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
 . . .
I believe that before this nation is committed to what may be a large-scale war, each of us in the Senate of the United States in reaching a decision which will be very personal and very difficult for all of us, we should ask ourselves a fundamental question: Will I be able to look at the parents and the wives, the husbands and the children in the eye and say that their loved ones sacrificed their lives for a cause vital to the United States and that there was no other reasonable alternative?
Mr. President, at this time I cannot.
 
Representative
Barbara F. Vucanovich
Republican of Nevada
I come from a military family. Two of my brothers were West Point graduates. My dad, a career Army officer, taught at West Point. And my grandfather, also a career Army officer and a doctor, was in the Medical Corps. One of my brothers gave his life at Anzio, and I can remember the day my mother was notified of my brother's sacrifice. It was a day that was permanently etched in my memory.
With this clearly in mind, do I look forward to casting a vote which could mean the loss of even one life of an American man or woman in the gulf? No, of course not. I'm sure none of us do. The decision to cast this vote should be made only after each of us examines our innermost conscience.
I think we need to reflect what the consequences will be, however, if we don't stop Saddam Hussein now. There can be no reward for brutal aggression. If we do nothing, and Saddam Hussein pays no price for swallowing up the country of Kuwait, destroying people's property, torturing, raping and killing innocent men and women and children, we are as guilty as he is.
 
Representative
Donald W. Riegle Jr.
Democrat of Michigan
Most of the forces that we have over there on that front-line situation right now are very young; they're not much older than these pages sitting down here in the well of the House, in the well of the Senate. A few years older, but they haven't lived very long. And if the bullets start flying, there are going to be a lot of them that are not going to live much longer. And that's just the sheer, miserable fact of war. War is about fire and steel and people dying.
I'm convinced in my own mind that if the sons and daughters of all of us, of the President, the Vice President, the Cabinet were all over there in the Persian Gulf right now, right up on the front line and were going to be part of that first assault wave that would go on into Kuwait, I think we'd be taking more time. I think we'd be working harder on the sanctions policy. I think we'd be trying to squeeze Saddam Hussein in every other way that we could, short of a shooting war.
 
Senator John McCain
Republican of Arizona
In this new world order, it is clear to me that if we fail to act there will be inevitably a succession of dictators, of Saddam Husseins -- of which around this globe there are an abundance, either in reality or would-be. And those dictators will see a green light, a green light for aggression, a green light for annexation of its weaker neighbors. And, indeed, over time a threat to the stability of this entire globe.
 
Representative Byron L. Dorgan
Democrat of North Dakota
It is a fig leaf to call this a multinational force. It is an American force and would be an American war. And we will decide to spend money we don't have, borrowed from our allies, to send American kids to risk their lives to protect allied oil. When will we understand that it is time for America to ask our allies to bear their fair share of the burden? And let me finally today say I'm here today because I'm concerned about Iraq, concerned about war, concerned about our role in the world. But I'm concerned about something else. I'm concerned about America. Choking on debt and threatened with an economic crisis from within, I see a President and a Congress standing tall, exhibiting steely resolve to stand up and talk tough to a tin-horn dictator in the Persian Gulf; willing to borrow money from abroad and risk our troops' lives to protect our allies' oil.
 
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman
Democrat of Connecticut
The issue before us is not to pick a day or time for hostilities to begin or to determine how a war is waged. No, that, in my opinion, is the clear responsibility of the President, as Commander in Chief under Article II of our Constitution.
The issue before the Congress under Article I, Section 8 is whether or not we authorize the President to use force to achieve our goals in the Persian Gulf -- whether or not we think that war is justified -- if the President chooses to wage it. On that issue, I will vote to authorize the President to have the power to go to war. I will do so in the knowledge that war may indeed be the result and that many good people may die. But I will cast that vote in the hopes that by so doing, I will make the prospects of peace more real. . . .
 
Representative Major R. Owens
Democrat of Brooklyn
Nearly one-third of our soldiers in Operation Desert Shield are African-American, many of them with families in districts like mine, the 12th Congressional District of Brooklyn. My district is the 10th poorest district in the nation.
My district is the second -- has the second-largest number of African-Americans. Young African-American men and women are three times more likely to be in the armed forces and involved in this impending war in the sand as young whites are. There is a reason for this.
When people can't get jobs they find the Army and the Navy and the other military units as an opportunity to be utilized. There are many very bright young people who never looked for a job but who are recruited from high school and told that you can go to college after you go through the military and get those advantages. And there are many -- there are a few others who are officers, quite a number are officers -- are African-American men and women who went to military academies or they used the benefits of the R.O.T.C. as the only way they could make it. For this reason you have this disproportionate number.
These are the same people who are penalized when President Bush refuses to pass a civil rights bill because it has a quota -- he claims it has a quota. There is some kind of ugly reverse quota operating when 33 percent of the troops on the front line are poor and African-American.
 
Representative Ike Skelton
Democrat of Missouri
The issue, Mr. Speaker, is whether the dream of Franklin Roosevelt will be fulfilled by reliance on the United Nations and the rule of law. This is a grave issue. It is, however, but a replay of the past. The faces are different but the issues and the challenges are the same.
So the question is, have we learned anything from the lessons of history. It's 1936, Adolf Hitler entered the Rhineland. Those great powers of the day, Great Britain and France, did nothing. Nineteen thirty-eight, Adolf Hitler demanded part of Czechoslovakia and got it, based upon a promise of no more territorial demands. It was Great Britain's Chamberlain, the Prime Minister, who returned from the Munich meeting with Adolf Hitler, proclaiming "peace in our time." How wrong he was.
The lesson in history of which I speak is found in the phrase, "We should have stopped him when we could." How many British, French and, yes, American families said that about Adolf Hitler after World War II?
Applying that sad lesson of history, we must stop Saddam Hussein now.
 
Senator Tom Harkin
Democrat of Iowa
Certainly naked aggression must be responded to, but what about a few weeks ago, when there was naked aggression in Chad by Libya? We didn't rush over there with our troops. How about Syria? Not too long ago, Syria -- now one of our allies -- Syria went into Lebanon and massacred 750 civilians. Well, that's naked aggression. We didn't do anything about it. Now Assad's on our side.
What about Indonesia's bloody excursion into East Timor, where they basically wiped out a country, killed a lot of people? We didn't do anything. Or when Saddam Hussein gassed the Kurds in his own country. That's naked aggression. We didn't do anything.
So what does this mean that we want to stop naked aggression. Does this mean that we are now going to say that the United States will indeed become the policeman of the world, and that we will respond to every instance of naked aggression? Or does it mean that we're just going to kind of pick and choose which ones we want to respond to or not.
How about the Soviets putting down the Lithuanians. Are we going to respond to that? I dare say we're not. So we're just going to kind of pick and choose which kind of naked aggression we want.
 
Representative Michael Bilirakis
Republican of Florida
I earnestly believe that what we will decide in the coming days goes far beyond the price of gas or the re-establishment of a desert sheikhdom, as I have heard alleged. No, what hangs in the balance here is nothing less than global order, the legitimacy of recognized boundaries around the world and the primacy of international law.
 . . .
We in this chamber would like nothing better than to believe that Saddam Hussein will be convinced by economic sanctions to leave Kuwait in peace. However, I have seen absolutely no evidence of this in the past six months, and without the threat of armed force being used against him at any time, I do not foresee Saddam altering his course of pillage, murder, rape and destruction.
 
Representative John Lewis
Democrat of Georgia
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak for peace. The decision we are about to make is too much to be made by one mortal. The representatives of the people must participate in this grave decision. These are very difficult times for all of us, yet we have a moral obligation, a mandate and a mission to do what we can to prevent war. In our time, we have seen too much violence, too much conflict and too many killings in the Middle East. We have an opportunity, my colleagues, to slow down this rush to war.
 
Representative Gerry E. Studds
Democrat of Massachusetts
I am unwilling to put my faith or American lives in the hands of those who tell us so confidently that a war will be quick, easy and successful. Yes, we can probably win. But we do not know how long it will take to win. We do not know how many American soldiers and innocent civilians will die. We do not know how many young men and women and children will be left without homes, without parents, without arms or legs or eyes, without the capacity to live a normal life. No computer, no politician, no so-called expert, not even our best and brightest, can do more than guess at the human costs of this war.
We cannot predict the economic costs of violence in the Persian Gulf. It will mean higher and perhaps far higher oil prices for God knows how long. The reason we are in the Persian Gulf is oil -- to protect our economy. By surrendering to war we will in that sense surely and ironically defeat ourselves.
And finally, if we go to war now, we will never know whether that war was necessary. Think about that. Think about the lives that'll be cut short, the families that will be shattered, the heartbreak that will be endured and ask yourself how much greater the pain will be if we are not certain whether those sacrifices had to occur.
 . . .
Mr. Speaker, our choice today is whether to persevere on the path of patience and determination and peace or to stray from that path into the wilderness of war. Whether to walk together the extra mile or the extra two miles in pursuit of a bloodless resolution to this crisis or to declare war and fight war and count the bodies and bury the bodies and never know whether a single American soldier really had to die.
 
Representative James H. Bilray
Democrat of Nevada
My own family disagrees with me on this vote. My daughter who is a junior in high school last night spent an hour at dinner telling me what a bad vote I was making. My daughter who is a senior in college spent 15-20 minutes just a few minutes ago telling me this was the worst vote I'd ever make. I understand their anguish. I understand the anguish of my parish priest who walked out of Mass this week and told me, please, let's not give the President the power to fight.
But I believe if we spit in the President's face, and that we deny him the ability to use whatever weapons are at his disposal to achieve peace, then we are going to cause war. Our only hope is that by giving the President the right to use force, he will not have to use that force.
 Representative
 
Joseph P. Kennedy 2d
Democrat of Massachusetts
This country, and everybody in this chamber, ought to be willing to look at themselves in the mirror and say whether or not we're here to protect some way of life that allows us to drive cars that get minimum gas mileage, that allows us to live in houses that are energy sieves, that allows us to work in buildings such as this one that are energy sieves as well, in order to protect some notion of a conservative aspect of our history that says that that's capitalism.
 . . .
And lastly, we're there to help our so-called Kuwaiti and Saudi friends. Need I remind the members of this chamber what the Kuwaitis and Saudis did to this country in 1973? Did to us again in 1979? We're there to protect these so-called friends? Ladies and gentlemen, these fickle friends have never proven that they are worth the kind of price that President Bush is committing.
 . . .
I understand that at the end of his remarks, Mr. Solomon from New Yorkquoted my uncle, President Kennedy, as suggesting that somehow or another there would be a tone of appeasement if he had not responded in the way he did to the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. I would just point out that President Kennedy established an embargo against Cuba in 1962. That is exactly what we are advocating on this side in 1990, is to create an embargo that will work.
 
Representative Gary L. Ackerman
Democrat of Queens
This is not why I came here, to vote for war. Yet over the last several weeks I have found myself at war with my own conscience. All my life, I've decried violence and all who commit it. All my life I've been and I am a peacemonger. I opposed Vietnam, and even Grenada. I oppose the death penalty. I don't think boxing is a sport. I'm even against killing animals without purpose. Toy guns and war games have always been banned from my house. I'm a father who wants his children to grow up in a world at peace.
 . . .
There were lessons in Vietnam. Saddam Hussein thinks he's learned one, that the United States has no national resolve, that Americans will do anything short of shedding blood, that the Congress will pick apart the President and undermine our troops and our strategy, and let him have his violent way.
Mr. Speaker, let us learn him a new lesson. The best chance for peace that we have is for a message to be sent from here today that the American people through their Congress is behind their President and their soldiers and are willing to stand up to his vicious aggression.
 . . .
I will not cast this vote with any sense of joy, I tremble at the thought of playing God and having to cast it. The only thing I fear more would be sitting on the rocker on the porch if God grants me the years to reach retirement, and having some little girl, who hopefully would look a little like her grandmother, look at me and ask, "Grandpa, why didn't anyone stop him?"
 
Senator John Glenn
Democrat of Ohio
Certainly Iraq is an ideal embargo target. And if the embargo ends in failure, we still have the military option. And I will fully support that course at that time. I believe the Persian Gulf is that important. But to again loose the terrors of war and the thousands of lives that hang in the balance, should not be the first resort. And just saying that Kuwait was attacked or that hostages have been mistreated will not be of much solace if flag-draped coffins for both male and female soldiers and sailors and marines and airmen line up in the hangars in Dover, Del.
 
Senator Christopher S. Bond
Republican of Missouri
Now I know that compelling arguments can be and have been made, arguments which are popularly appealing, arguments against war. Here's a good one, and I quote: "How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas masks because of a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing. It seems still more impossible that a quarrel which had already been settled in principle, should be the subject of war." In case you don't recognize that quote, it was from Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain in a London broadcast on Sept. 27, 1938.
I believe the better policy then and the policy -- better policy now was summed up by Winston Churchill in the dark days leading up to World War II. Churchill said civilization will not last, freedom will not survive, peace will not be kept unless a very large majority of mankind unites together to defend them and show themselves possessed of a constabulary power before which barbaric and atavistic forces will stand in awe.
I believe the reason we must adopt the resolution supporting the position of the U.N. resolution is very simple and straightforward. The simple reason we must act is that we cannot allow Saddam Hussein to profit from his aggression. The world stands poised at a critical moment in history. The cold war has come to a close and the world is entering into a new era. . . . If we allow Saddam Hussein to succeed in this venture -- the first of the truly post-cold-war era -- we will pay the price for years to come. . . .
 
Representative Barbara Boxer
Democrat of California
I have seen the weapons that are arrayed against Iraq. I've seen them up close, in the Persian Gulf. They're awesome! We can inflict the ultimate pain on the people of Iraq, make no mistake. We will win this war -- quickly! Maybe two weeks, maybe two months -- that's quick. Maybe at most six months -- that's quick, I guess.
But my colleagues, it won't come free. There's a huge price if we choose this route, even in the best of circumstances. The price is in body bags, in babies killed, in an uncertain, unstable Middle East even after the crisis. In a decade that will be lost as we once again have put our resources into war and weapons and rob our people of what they need in this country.
I had a community meeting in my district, I had two in one day. A thousand people came out. I've never seen anything like it. We voted on how they would vote on a resolution to go to war and 95 percent voted no. That's my district in California.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 15, 1991, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A subheading on Saturday with excerpts from the Congressional debate about the Persian Gulf referred incorrectly in some copies to Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan. He is a Senator, not a Representative.
Because of an editing error, debate excerpts from comments by Senator Bob Graham of Florida referred incorrectly in some copies to the resolution that he supported. He said he would vote to authorize the President's use of force in the gulf, not to favor continued sanctions.

THE JAPAN THAT CAN SAY NO
By Shintaro Ishihara.
Translated by Frank Baldwin.
158 pp. New York: Simon & Schuster. $18.95. 
 Reader beware! This book purports to be the English translation of a book by the same title that Shintaro Ishihara published in Japan a year ago, where it caused an instant sensation. It is not what it pretends to be. The present volume contains an entirely new part -- more than half the book -- which is totally different both in substance and in tone from the author's original text. Also, the present version omits the chapters that Akio Morita, the founder and chairman of the Sony Corporation, contributed to the original text.
As it stands, there is nothing in this short work that explains either the success of the original version in Japan, where it sold more than a million copies, or its lurid reputation in the United States as America-bashing and ultranationalist. If Mr. Ishihara bashes anyone in this version of "The Japan That Can Say No," it's the Japanese establishment: Japan's diplomats play golf instead of learning about the countries to which they are accredited; the civil service is arrogant, the businessmen greedy, the politicians cowardly and corrupt. As to the United States, Mr. Ishihara, alone of all senior Japanese politicians (he is a leader of the Liberal Democratic Party), supports opening Japan's public-works market to American builders. He favors opening Japan's telecommunications market to American manufacturers (whose products he considers far more reliable). He wants Japan to accept America's demand and dismantle her mom-and-pop stores so that American goods have access to the Japanese consumer. And in his discussion of Japan's technological lead and America's lag, he says nothing that has not been said -- and far more critically -- in scores of American books and articles. His most widely quoted statement (almost certainly an erroneous one, by the way) -- that United States missiles could not hit their targets without Japanese semiconductors -- comes out of a study done by the Pentagon to justify requests for additional funding.
Altogether, Mr. Ishihara says again and again that his aim is to strengthen the United States-Japanese alliance. He is worried, above all, that with the Soviet threat receding, the United States will push aside its alliance with Japan and switch instead to Mr. Gorbachev's reformed Soviet Union as its main ally in the Pacific and in Asia.
On everything economic -- that is, on all the main areas of contention between the United States and Japan -- Mr. Ishihara wants Japan to say yes to the United States. In fact, the chapter that discusses these issues is entitled "Saying Yes to America." Where he wants his country to say no is on defense. He complains that the United States has stopped Japan from doing more for its own defense. Actually, as Mr. Ishihara surely knows, this country -- wisely or not -- has, since the Carter Administration, been urging Japan to take on more responsibility for its own defense. It is the Japanese voters who do not want their country to be anything but an economic power -- as witness their overwhelming rejection of their Prime Minister's proposal, only a few months ago, to have unarmed Japanese soldiers join American forces in the Persian Gulf.
Mr. Ishihara is, of course, anything but a liberal. He is a Realpolitiker of the old school, not too far apart from Henry Kissinger in his basic approach. Like Mr. Kissinger, he puts economics last, behind power, respect and dignity. What sets Mr. Ishihara apart from his fellow politicians in Japan is not his being a nationalist -- most of them are. But their policy is to take the cash of economic success and let go of the credit that power can provide. Mr. Ishihara wants the credit and is quite willing to pay a lot of cash for it.
Nonetheless, few of his readers, whether in Japan or in the United States, will pay attention to what Mr. Ishihara actually says. They will hear only how he says it. And while Mr. Ishihara's arguments are those of the traditional Realpolitiker, his rhetoric is pure demagoguery. He writes, for instance, that "Japanese should not forget that Caucasians are prejudiced against Orientals." Altogether, this is the book of a poor loser. For -- at least so far -- Mr. Ishihara has lost out.
Very early in his career and at a very young age by Japanese standards, he was appointed to senior cabinet posts, first in defense, then in transportation. In both he performed with distinction. Yet he has been shunted aside. What derailed him is that -- as in this book -- he has always permitted the incisive mind of the statesman to be drowned out by the voice of the demagogue. In this book he talks continually of his being candid. But the Japanese speak of him as being abrasive, if not abusive. In the end, his tongue and his pen simply made too many enemies. And so this book can be considered a loser's attempt to get back into the running.
Still, whatever Mr. Ishihara's intention, there are far too many meanspirited "bashing" books on both sides of the Pacific. They bespeak a deep discontent, a growing distemper between the United States and Japan. The cause is precisely that neither country can say no to the other. They are far too dependent on each other. The Japanese depend on the United States market for two-fifths of their industrial exports -- about twice as much as makes for good trade relations. The United States depends on Japanese money to cover a very large part of the Federal deficit through the purchase of United States treasury bonds. Such dependences are unhealthy, especially between great powers. They make it inevitable for each country to accuse the other of unfairness and bad faith.
The basic problem is, however, not American industrial weakness, as Mr. Ishihara -- and most American writers -- contend. To be sure, there are serious weaknesses in American industry and technology. Yet United States manufactured exports to Japan have actually doubled in the last five years -- as fast a leap as any country's industrial exports to Japan have taken before. What lies at the root of our trade deficit is the collapse of world farm and commodity prices since 1979 -- and Japan is the United States' largest farm and commodity customer. If farm and commodity prices, in relation to manufactured-goods prices, were still on the 1979 level, the trade deficit with Japan would be so small as to present no problem at all. We cannot wait for farm prices to rise -- if indeed they ever will. And as long as we depend on Japanese money to finance the Federal deficit, we will not turn down Japanese imports -- for it is their trade surplus with the United States that alone gives the Japanese the dollars to buy our treasury bonds. The only way to cure the United States-Japanese uneasiness before it becomes a serious sickness is to cut the Federal deficit. Then it will be the United States that can say no to Japan.

THE FOURTH K
By Mario Puzo.
479 pp. New York:
Random House. $22. 
 Some 30 years ago in India, Edward Durrell Stone designed a handsome residence for the American Ambassador, in which my wife and I were the first residents. On occasion, passers-by wandered in to look at the rather magnificent reception area; once, after a somewhat questionable political conversation with a high Indian official, we walked out of my study to find that another and somewhat antipathetic politician had strolled in to listen to our conversation through the open grillwork that was a feature of Stone's architecture. In recent times back in India I found the whole house and embassy completely surrounded by high, formidable and very ugly concrete walls. Entry now requires notification and identification paralleling that needed for a journey to see Saddam Hussein, and a small letter that was sent to me in care of the embassy came with an imprint saying that it had been X-rayed for detection of possible explosives.
It is this trend toward protection against terrorist violence, continued a few years into the future, that Mario Puzo seeks to make plausible in his latest novel, "The Fourth K." The increase in terrorist activity as well as all the other violent behavior of our time has continued. So also have the responding defenses, and especially those surrounding the President of the United States. In Mr. Puzo's novel, he lives in a kind of iron box that has been added as another story to the White House. Secret Service men alone have access -- they double as servants -- and they have now been united with the Federal Bureau of Investigation under the relentless attention of the Attorney General. The cost of protecting the Presidential person is $100 million annually and the enterprise employs 10,000 men, although their cost does provoke some passing comment.
The President so enclosed is Francis Xavier Kennedy, a member of a cadet branch of the noted Kennedy family. I assume that he is "The Fourth K," John, Robert and Edward having gone before, but Mr. Puzo's imagination being what it is, it could be Henry Kissinger, Henry the K, who somehow had got into the chain. There is that tendency to sanguinary action. And with Mr. Puzo anything is possible.
His imagination is indeed extreme, and some will think uncontrolled. Francis Xavier, whose resemblance to his noted precursors is not extreme, has been swept into office just as his lovely and loving wife dies, and he is sustained as to family only by his beautiful and independent college-age daughter, Theresa. He has a fine if largely undisclosed social agenda but he cannot do anything about it, for, in a further projection from our time, a small coterie of incredibly rich reactionaries, the Socrates Club, has bought up the entire Congress, which has lost to its paymasters all capacity for independent action.
However, in the most portentous of all developments, it is terrorism that has gone to a new dimension. On one otherwise pleasant spring day, a great terrorist network with powerful but rather indistinct revolutionary aims arranges to shoot the Pope, hijack the plane carrying the President's daughter, take it to an Arabian emirate and shoot her dead. Her fellow passengers become hostages. A bad week.
Francis Xavier Kennedy responds in a forthright way, one that will rejoice all partisans of surgical and even ordinary bomb strikes: he orders the emirate to release the hostages and surrender those responsible; if they don't, he will destroy the capital, with the further promise of destroying the country as a whole. In the end the city is destroyed, although the President, in a thoughtful gesture, does tell the inhabitants that they should get out of town.
Meanwhile, there has been an interesting development back in Washington. Popular opinion is with Kennedy; the rich controllers of the Congress, those Socrates men, are, however, adverse. Among other things, one of the club's members has a $50 billion investment in that emirate, and even he does not take such sums lightly. Accordingly they arrange the impeachment of Kennedy, which takes only a matter of a few hours. Richard Nixon would be impressed.
The story goes on from there with a homemade atomic bomb exploding around Times Square, a great electoral recovery by Kennedy and yet more. But these matters I must leave to the reader to explore in detail. A summary could be unfair to the author; it might make the whole story seem a bit far out.
I have said that Mr. Puzo has based his novel on a rather large leap from current disorders and disasters. This is not confined to terrorism, impeachment and related dissonance. Mr. Puzo is also alert to present tendencies in language and sex. His characters, high and low, inject metaphorical defecation and fornication into their speech at approximately one-sentence intervals. And in the great tradition set by John O'Hara, he regularly arrests the narrative and puts his people in bed with all appropriate contortion and on at least one occasion, as O'Hara was also said to do, without their previously having shaken hands. That happens during a long sequence in Hollywood that seems not to contribute appreciably to the plot but does, one suspects, make use of the author's observations there while his earlier, best-selling work, the "Godfather" saga, made it to the screen.
As I hope I have sufficiently made clear, I am impressed by the author's imagination -- his ability to take the worst in present life and make it worse. I am somewhat less impressed by the plausibility of his prospect. In that lightning impeachment and, I think, in quite a number of other matters, including the homemade bomb in New York, it goes well beyond the range of reasonable probability. Nor, his considerable narrative skill notwithstanding, does Mr. Puzo succeed in making other developments seem terribly likely. From this I take some comfort.
 
 
THANK GOD HE HAD NO POLITICAL SCRUPLES
 Francis Kennedy, President of the United States, one of the most powerful men on earth, was alone in his bed, fearful for his daughter's life, and unable to command sleep.
Sleep forbidden, he tried to stave off the terror that kept him from sleep. He told himself the hijackers would not dare harm Theresa, that his daughter would come safely home. In this he was not powerless -- he did not have to rely on the weak, fallible gods of medicine, he did not have to fight invincible cancerous cells. No. He could save his daughter's life. He could bend the power of his country, spend its authority. It all rested in his hands and thank God he had no political scruples. His daughter was the only thing he had left on this earth that he really loved. He would save her.
But then anxiety, a wave of such fear it seemed to stop his heart, made him put on the light above his head. . . .
He believed that the plane had been hijacked because his daughter was on it. The hijacking was possible because of the vulnerability of established authority to a few determined, ruthless and possibly high-minded terrorists. And it had been inspired by the fact that he, Francis Kennedy, President of the United States, was the prominent symbol of that established authority. So by his desire to be President of the United States, he, Francis Kennedy, was responsible for placing his daughter in danger. . . .
What had been his wish? To arrive at a successful destiny of the Kennedy name? But he had been only a cousin. He remembered his great-uncle Joseph Kennedy, legendary womanizer, one who amassed gold, a mind so sharp for the instant but so blind to the future. . . . And what a tragic end. A lucky life until the last chapter: the murder of his two sons, so young, so highly placed. The old man defeated, a final stroke exploding his brain.
Making your son President -- could a father have greater joy? And had the old kingmaker sacrificed his sons for nothing? Had the gods punished him not so much for his pride but for his pleasure? Or was it all accident? His sons Jack and Robert, so rich, so handsome, so gifted, killed by those powerless nobodies who wrote themselves into history with the murder of their betters. No, there could be no purpose, it was all accident. So many little things could turn fate aside, tiny precautions reverse the course of tragedy.
And yet -- and yet there was the odd feeling of doom. Why the linking of the Pope's killer and the kidnapping of the President's daughter? Why the delay before stating their demands? What other strings in the labyrinth were there to be played out? . . .
In the darkness he was terrified at how it all might end. He felt the familiar always-suppressed rage, the dread. He remembered the agonizing day when he had heard the first whisper that his uncle Jack was dead, and his mother's long terrible scream. -- From "The Fourth K."

THE HIDDEN WAR
A Russian Journalist's Account of the Soviet War in Afghanistan.
By Artyom Borovik.
Illustrated. 288 pp. New York:
A Morgan Entrekin Book/The Atlantic Monthly Press. $19.95. 
 The great contraction of Soviet power that continues to this day began, we tend to forget, not at the Berlin Wall but at the Salang Pass. Across that icy passage through the mountains of northern Afghanistan, young Soviet soldiers completed their retreat in February 1989, after the expenditure of a million Afghan and at least 15,000 Soviet lives. It was there that the Brezhnev doctrine, justifying military intervention to defend kindred "revolutions," first went into remission.
The decision by Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his associates to abandon the nine-year venture in Afghanistan probably began as a deliberate geopolitical calculation: the war was a major obstacle to better relations with the United States and two southern neighbors, China and Iran. It undermined the marketing of Mr. Gorbachev's new political thinking and endangered the potential dividends of detente: a suspension of the arms race; access to Western investment, credits and technology.
When the Kremlin began looking for a way out in 1986, it had little call to reckon with domestic public opinion. Andrei D. Sakharov, who had been sent into exile for complaining too loudly about the war, resumed his calls for withdrawal immediately after Mr. Gorbachev freed him in December 1986, but outside a small circle of dissidents the war was not much of an issue. This was not the United States in the Vietnam years. The church was utterly submissive, the campuses were apathetic refuges from the draft and the influential intelligentsia (whose children, like their American counterparts, often managed to avoid serving) were intoxicated with the novelty of glasnost.
The general public knew little about the war, and was content not to know. The heavily censored Soviet press reports portrayed the Soviet troops as something akin to the Peace Corps, building hospitals in squalid villages while the Afghan army bore the brunt of the fighting. In the Soviet press, Soviet soldiers did not die, or desert their comrades, or commit atrocities, or come home addicted to drugs and haunted by nightmares.
Once the disengagement from Afghanistan was set in slow motion, however, the censorship was gradually relaxed. Among the first to give the public an honest glimpse of the war was Artyom Borovik, then 26 years old. His reports in the summer of 1987 in the popular weekly Ogonyok, compiled in the first section of "The Hidden War," gave Soviet readers a taste of the death, boredom and horror of a guerrilla war in an exotic place.
If Mr. Borovik's officers tend to be noble and his soldiers rather poetic, they are also at times frightened and disoriented. Occasionally they are less than heroic. A helicopter ferrying injured soldiers to their base runs out of gas, and as it spirals toward the earth the navigator and mechanic crawl past the wounded to bail out. Mr. Borovik describes the drugs, and the trauma of returning home to an ungrateful motherland. He uses an interview with a veteran American war correspondent, Peter Arnett of CNN, to make the analogy with Vietnam.
It may be hard for an American reading these dispatches today to grasp what an impact they had. At the time, in the hypersensitive climate of early glasnost, the articles and their implicit doubt -- What are we doing here? -- were a sensation at home. And by exposing the hardships of men at war, Mr. Borovik became a hero to the soldiers themselves. I recently asked a former paratrooper in the central Russian city of Sverdlovsk if he recalled Mr. Borovik's articles. He went to his desk and pulled out a dogeared copy of the three-year-old dispatches. "He got it right," the paratrooper said appreciatively. "The salt and dirt of war."
Such reporting, by Mr. Borovik and a few others, like Gennadi Bocharov in the Moscow weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta, did not generate an antiwar movement. But it helped undermine the rationale for the war, made the withdrawal irreversible and contributed to the imperial malaise that made any other such venture -- say, to hold Eastern Europe by force -- unthinkable.
By the time he returned to witness the end of the war in 1989, Mr. Borovik had outgrown the last of his illusions about the war, as indeed had much of the country. The Communist cause that was ostensibly being defended in Afghanistan was now discredited at home. The American threat (I have talked to many young soldiers who genuinely believed the United States intended to put missiles at their southern border in Afghanistan) seemed absurd as the great imperialist adversary became the great capitalist role model.
In the second and more powerful section of this book, based on his material from the closing months of the war, Mr. Borovik describes his visits to a Kabul mental ward, recounts stories of atrocities against Afghan civilians, tells of botched operations and soldiers in despair. He writes about how various soldiers and officers behave in retreat, some rising above the absurdity, others succumbing to it. He interviews, not unsympathetically, Soviet deserters who have made their way to the United States.
"In Afghanistan we bombed not only the detachments of rebels and their caravans, but our own ideals as well," he writes. "With the war came the reevaluation of our moral and ethical values. In Afghanistan the policies of the government became utterly incompatible with the inherent morality of our nation."
An introductory section includes a wide range of interviews with subjects from Alexander Haig to the former Afghan leader Babrak Karmal, in which they speculate about why Moscow went into Afghanistan in the first place. The finger-pointing -- the foreign ministry blames the military, the military blames Mr. Karmal, Mr. Karmal blames the Soviet "failure to understand Afghanistan" and everyone blames the K.G.B. -- is amusing but inconclusive.
"The Hidden War," however, is not about how the Soviet Union fell into this war, but about the cost in lives and spirit that, once it sank in, assured the venture will not soon be repeated. Anyone who wants to understand why Mr. Gorbachev today dares not commit troops to another Islamic desert, in the Persian Gulf, will find answers in this book.
 
CORRUPTED BY FRATERNAL STRUGGLE
 We were obsessed with our messianic mission and blinded by arrogance. How could we have possibly hoped to teach the Afghans anything when we ourselves never learned to manage our own economy properly? . . .
"If you want to learn about a strange country," say experienced travelers, "disappear in it." But in Afghanistan we couldn't even manage to do that. During the nine years of war we were constantly separated from the country by eight millimeters of bulletproof glass through which we stared in fear from inside our armored carriers.
We thought that we were civilizing a backward country by exposing it to television, to modern bombers, to schools, to the latest models of tanks, to books, to long-range artillery, to newspapers, to new types of weapons, to economic aid, to AK-47s. But we rarely stopped to think how Afghanistan would influence us -- despite the hundreds of thousands of Soviet soldiers and officers and the scores of diplomats, journalists, scholars, and military and political advisers who passed through it.
It's difficult to determine exactly what we managed to teach Afghanistan. It is relatively easy, however, to assess Afghanistan's effects on the Soviet people who worked and fought there. With a mere wave of Brezhnev's elderly hand they were thrown into a country where bribery, corruption, profiteering, and drugs were no less common than the long lines in Soviet stores. These diseases can be far more infectious and dangerous than hepatitis. . . .
The war in Afghanistan dragged on for nine long years -- fully an eighth of Soviet history.
With each passing day, the war more and more resembled the sexual performance of an impotent. -- From "The Hidden War."

 BODY:
The dark terror of the television lacklisting days (1950-1955) now seems far off, and most of us who were caught in the middle of the storm have developed fuzzy memories -- perhaps deliberately. And we dig into our consciences to examine the part we played in that shameful era. Like the French after the liberation, we all claim to have been part of the Resistance. None of us were collaborators. Or were we? Was I?
My first contact with blacklisting came in June 1950, just about the same time that Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television came off the presses. Published in New York City by a newsletter called Counterattack, which was founded in 1947 by former F.B.I. men, Red Channels quickly became the bible of television, subscribed to by networks, sponsors and their ad agencies. Its underlying thesis, that Communists were infiltrating television, became the accepted doctrine of the day. 
 "What's My Line," my first major television production, had been on the air four months. On that early panel were Dorothy Kilgallen, Arlene Francis, Hal Block, a comedy writer, and the poet Louis Untermeyer. Our sponsor was Stopette, a deodorant. We had no sooner booked Untermeyer than CBS and the sponsor began to receive letters of protest. Untermeyer was in Red Channels. Apparently, he had, among other sins, permitted his name to be affiliated with the Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee and been a sponsor of the 1948 May Day Parade. As we soon found out, the reason for the listing was of minor importance. What counted was simply being named. The protest mail turned into a deluge, all obviously organized. Members of the Catholic War Veterans began putting stickers on drugstore windows warning "Stop Stop ette Until Stopette Stops Untermeyer."
Untermeyer and I were summoned to the office of Ralph Colin, the principal CBS attorney at the time. Colin was active in the art and literary world and seemed well acquainted with Untermeyer. Nonetheless, he was harsh in his pronouncement. "Louis," he admonished, "how could you be so naive? Don't you understand what's going on in the world today? The pressures we're under?" Untermeyer, at that time in his mid-60's, was crestfallen. "I'm sorry, Ralph," he apologized. But the decision was made. Untermeyer was out, replaced by Bennett Cerf. While Bennett became a great friend of mine and was superb on the show, it's difficult to forget my feeling of helplessness and embarrassment at this strange trial that permitted no witnesses, no cross-examination, and where the prosecutor was also the judge. I confess that I did not try to fight that decision. I complained to my lawyer, a trusted friend and a liberal. He advised caution: "Be careful. Don't buy a headache." And I didn't, at least at that time.
It was many months before I found the guts to offer any kind of resistance to the hysteria.
Red Channels was not the only source that identified "subversives" by implication and association. The weekly Counterattack published additional lists; Firing Line, issued by the American Legion's Commission on Americanism, also had an array of "dupes" and "Communist fronters." Major advertising agencies hired their own security officers and developed their own lists. So did each network. At CBS, the man in charge of "clearances" in 1950 was Joseph H. Ream, a vice president. He soon turned the task over to a dedicated full-time security man, Daniel T. O'Shea. There were lists on top of lists, and networks, ad agencies and sponsors exchanged information on a regular basis. If a performer, writer, musician, producer or director was on one list, he immediately found himself on every other list.
Every employee at CBS was required to sign a loyalty oath. So far as I know, none refused. The procedure for clearing performers was standard and mandatory. Thus, on "What's My Line," before booking a panelist or a mystery guest, a production assistant would call O'Shea's office and indicate the proposed booking. If the performer's name was on any list the word would come back: "not cleared." I remember that Leonard Bernstein, Judy Holliday, Harry Belafonte, Abe Burrows, Gypsy Rose Lee, Jack Gilford, Uta Hagen and Hazel Scott were declared off limits. It was made very clear that producers were, under no circumstances, to let performers know they were being blacklisted.
The sort of scene with Untermeyer stopped taking place. Performers were no longer confronted with the reasons that they were removed from shows or not booked in the first place. Essential to the blacklisting was a conspiracy of silence. Explanations were never given. "Not cleared" was the only communication, or -- in some cases -- the code phrase "a bad actor." The victim of the blacklisting seldom knew what hit him. He simply became unemployable.
In the 1950's, television programs were generally underwritten by a single advertiser. Some sponsors were more sensitive than others to charges of "un-American" leanings, and their ad agencies reflected the principals' anxiety in spades.
In 1952, our panel show "I've Got a Secret" acquired a new sponsor, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, with its advertising agency, William Esty. Garry Moore was the host of the panel, which included Henry Morgan, Bill Cullen, Jayne Meadows and Faye Emerson.
Morgan was named in Red Channels, but for such a frivolous reason that no one -- not even CBS -- took it seriously. Morgan was essentially an apolitical curmudgeon who shot darts at any pompous balloon he saw floating by. Certainly he was no "Communist dupe." The closest he came to being duped was by his wife, who, Morgan told me, was a leftist sympathizer, and it was understood that one reason Morgan was getting a divorce was his aversion to Mrs. Morgan's politics. Thus he was listed in Red Channels as a result of a marital connection he was trying to terminate.
But R. J. Reynolds took the listing seriously. At least the William Esty agency did, and I was informed that Morgan would have to go. I'd done previous business with the two men in charge of the account -- reasonable, decent guys -- and paid them a visit. They agreed completely that the charge in Red Channels was nonsensical. But as they put it: "Camel cigarettes don't want to know from reasons. They're in the business of selling tobacco, and hostile mail will make Winston-Salem edgy." The account could be at risk. And for what? For one man? I left that meeting with an ultimatum: dump Morgan pronto or Reynolds would cancel.
This was about two years into the blacklisting period, and for the first time I decided, with some trepidation, to try to buck the storm. But I needed a linebacker. I went to see Garry Moore. I knew very little about Moore's politics except that he voted Republican. I proposed a deal: "If you'll refuse to perform if Henry is cut from the show, I'll refuse to deliver the program. I'll take the gamble of cancellation if you will." Garry didn't blink. "I'm with you all the way," he said.
My friends at the ad agency were flabbergasted. It seems like nothing today, but in 1952 it was virtually unheard of to have this kind of a confrontation. The executives said they would have to kick this thing around. "I've Got a Secret" was enormously popular, and Garry Moore, an established comedian, had agreed to do the commercials live. "We'll get back to you," they said.
Morgan was kept on. The show was not canceled, and some weeks later his name somehow simply vanished from Red Channels. We never really understood how this happened, and we didn't press our luck by trying to find out.
At roughly the same time, over at ABC, I had another show called "The Name's the Same." For whatever reason, no doubt budgetary, ABC did not maintain an elaborate monitoring department, and it soon became clear that here was a venue where I could use otherwise blacklisted performers. I remember booking Judy Holliday, Jack Gilford and others who were not permitted appearances elsewhere. And I put Abe Burrows on as a regular.
Burrows was a brilliant comedy writer known for "Duffy's Tavern" on radio, and he was a co-author of "Guys and Dolls," the 1950 Broadway hit. But he still couldn't be used in television. During the war years Burrows had apparently taken part in cultural activities sponsored by Communists in California. To clear his name, he appeared twice before the House Un-American Activities Committee. The committee, after extensive hearings, released Burrows, apparently cleared, from further questioning. But the mere story of his appearance before the committee made headlines in the tabloid press, and Aware Inc., a group formed "to combat the Communist conspiracy in entertainment-communication," and the American Legion were not so forgiving. So when we booked Burrows on "The Name's the Same," it wasn't long before organized mail began to roll in. A sponsor of that program was a privately held Midwestern company, C. A. Swanson & Sons, makers of Swanson frozen TV dinners.
The mail demanding Burrows's expulsion continued to escalate. We were receiving upward of a thousand letters a week. I quietly dropped them in wastebaskets hoping that protest groups would tire of the battle. No such luck. The mail increased. In addition, the Catholic War Veterans began to picket the theater in New York where the show was broadcast. I kept waiting for a call from the sponsor, and it finally came from Omaha. From W. Clarke Swanson.
"Are you getting mail about Abe Burrows?" he asked. I conceded that we were. "We're getting a lot of it back here," he said, worried. "Is Burrows a Communist?" I replied that to my best knowledge he was not. "In that case, what's the shooting about?" he asked. I filled him in on Abe's story. "If that's what it's all about," he said, "forget it. If you feel like it, keep on using him."
Another little victory. But from what a bizarre source! First Garry Moore, now Clarke Swanson. Both Republicans. Where were my liberal friends? As the executive director of The Commonweal, John Cogley, pointed out in his Fund for the Republic Inc. Report on Blacklisting in 1956: "The operation was carried out, for the most part, by people who were personally and privately opposed to it." In 1951 the Authors' League of America indicated that it had "positive proof" of blacklisting. Yet the majority of writers who "knew for sure" that blacklisting was rife declined to testify before the Federal Communications Commission. As Cogley said: "The dangers of reprisal are too great."
In any case, a few months later even Swanson had to raise the white flag. It came face to face with Laurence A. Johnson and the phenomenon of the "Syracuse Crusade." Johnson was proof of how a small man with a tiny base but a strident voice could wield tremendous power. Johnson owned just four supermarkets in and around Syracuse. Whenever it came to his attention that a "controversial" performer was appearing on television, he would threaten to hang signs over the offending company's goods warning that the manufacturer employed "subversives" on television. He also phoned and wrote to other supermarket owners throughout the country. Many major corporations played ball. In 1952, a vice president of Kraft Foods Company wrote Johnson: "It is indeed heartening to know that you are continuing your crusade. . . . Keep up the good work." The president of the General Ice Cream Corporation wrote: "I think it is wonderful that you have taken this interest in ferreting Communists out of our entertainment industry. I wish there were more people like you."
Now it was Swanson's turn to get it. Johnson passed out ballots in his supermarkets that read as follows:
Do you want any part of your purchase price of Swanson Foods to be used to hire Communist fronters?
 
Yes........No........
Indicate your choice by x in the appropriate box.
Overwhelmingly, of course, the customers voted no. Johnson sent copies of these ballots to other stores. Many of them also removed Swanson products. Clarke Swanson phoned me apologetically. "I'm sorry, friend" he said, "but we've got to let Abe go. He's a good guy, but we can't risk our business for one man." By that time ABC had also started to lean on us. So Abe was axed. When I informed Burrows of the bad news, he understood. He'd been aware of the situation and thanked us for keeping him on as long as we had. Luckily, Abe was not really damaged since he had a major hit on Broadway. The New York theater, by the way, ignored all the listings during the McCarthy era, continuing to cast such performers as Jack Gilford and Uta Hagen, who were blocked from television.
It was at about this time that I was confronted with the reductio ad absurdum of blacklisting. We were doing a show on CBS called "It's News to Me," hosted by John Daly and later Walter Cronkite. One of the panelists was an English actress, Anna Lee. The sponsor was Sanka Coffee, a product of General Foods. The advertising agency was Young & Rubicam. One day, I received a call from the agency requesting that we drop Anna Lee at once. I had long become inured to off-the-wall blacklistings -- but this one was simply too wild. "Anna Lee? Impossible. She's never been touched by any list. What's going on?" The caller was guarded: "You know we don't talk about these things. I'm sure you can find a good reason to unbook her." I then did something that in those days was verboten. I had lunch with Anna Lee. I probed tentatively about her politics. She seemed nonplused but told me that she was not political, except that she voted Conservative in England. "What about your husband?" "He's a Texas Republican," she responded. "Why do you ask?" I said that there was some sort of mix-up and finished the lunch.
I went right to Young & Rubicam. There were four or five executives waiting in the conference room. "Gentlemen," I opened, "this one is crazy. Anna Lee is about as leftist as Herbert Hoover." The men looked at each other and one replied: "Yes, we know. We did a little more checking, and it turned out that there is a different Anna Lee who sometimes writes for The Daily Worker." "Well," I said, "I'm glad we both checked, and that takes care of that." Then came the zinger: "We're sorry, but we're going to have to drop Anna Lee anyway. We're already starting to get mail, and we can't let the sponsor be involved with protests." At that point I lost it. I said the demand was outrageous and that they were free to cancel the show if they wanted to, but I was not about to kill Anna Lee because she was guilty of having the same name as someone else.
When I got back to my office, there was a call waiting from a member of the agency -- a longtime friend -- with a warning: "Don't lose your temper like that in front of men who don't know you. When you stormed out of the office they asked, 'Is he a pinko?' " Subtitle of that little episode: "How I Almost Made the List Myself."
Anna Lee stayed on. The show stayed on. But so did the blacklisting, for at least three more years. Broadway stars weren't that damaged, but lesser names were exiled and made unemployable, often with tragic consequences. Philip Loeb, forced off "The Goldbergs," died from an overdose of sleeping pills.
I can't help the feeling that if I'd shown more courage, if I'd stood up earlier, if more of us had been willing to take the heat, we could have brought that disgraceful era to a more rapid close. But that's hindsight.

HEADLINE: ANTIQUES;
The Winter Antiques Show

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

 BODY:
The winter antiques Show -- long the nation's most prestigious and profitable antiques fair -- will be dramatically different when it opens later this month at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan.
Many booths will be smaller, the wood floors will be carpeted, and the roster of 66 dealers will include 18 new merchants -- more than were ever added at one time in the show's 37-year history. The show, which begins with benefit previews on Friday, Jan. 25, remains through Feb. 3. 
 The new look comes after a decade of conflict between the dealers and the show's management, headed by Mario Buatta, the interior designer who is chairman of the event. Mr. Buatta is credited with making the show the most glamorous and commercially successful antiques event anywhere, but he has also been criticized for the decline in the quality of its offerings, a decline that dealers claim can be corrected by vetting every object for authenticity.
Profits for the show's sponsor, the East Side House Settlement, a 100-year-old charity operating in the East Bronx, are now off after 17 years of increases, rising from $61,000 in 1974 to $840,000 in 1988. But in the last two years profits dropped -- to $805,000 in 1989 and to $610,000 in 1990.
According to James F. McCollum Jr., a member of the East Side board, the cost of presenting the show has increased in the last few years while revenues from ticket sales and booth rentals have sagged. These shifts are due to general economic conditions as well as the dwindling number of dealers participating in the show.
The most important changes for the show, which were announced last year, will not be evident until next year. They include both vetting -- reviewing every object on display for authenticity -- and the departure of Mr. Buatta, who has headed the fair for 17 years -- longer than any of his predecessors. He announced his resignation in December, effective Feb. 3, because, he said, he was told by Richard B. Hollaman, the president of the East Side board, that vetting would be postponed until 1992.
"I told him it was a great mistake," Mr. Buatta said. "I think New Yorkers and the press want to see vetting."
According to N. Pendergast Jones, manager of the show, vetting was postponed because "we got a late start and just felt we couldn't do it as well as the show deserved."
Mr. Buatta did not agree. "In my October letter to the benefactors and patrons, we announced this would be a vetted show," he said. "When I was told it would not be, that put the cap on the bottle, so to speak."
Paradoxically, Mr. Buatta had always been the most outspoken foe of vetting, which for decades has been a standard practice at most major European antiques shows and an issue since 1983 at the Armory show. "It would take two extra days at the armory to vet it," Mr. Buatta said, elaborating on his traditional opposition to the idea. "It would cost us a lot of money, and we're a charity show. This show will be hard to vet because it has wares from all over the world, whereas the European shows are more narrowly focused."
It was competition that spurred his change of heart. "When the International Antique Dealers Show came with vetting in 1989, the public became aware of what vetting was all about," Mr. Buatta said. "People questioned why the goods at the Winter Antiques Show weren't vetted. Last year, the dealers in the show were polled, and a majority voted to have the show vetted."
In September 1989 the International Antique Dealers Show became the first vetted show in New York City. The event, organized by the London ceramic dealers Brian and Anna Haughton, is sponsored by the National Antique and Art Dealers Association, which comprises mostly New York dealers. Long before the second International show opened last October, several dealers who had participated in both fairs in 1989 left the winter show. Many of the 19 who walked said they left because they objected to the absence of vetting; they also cited such issues as the new floor plan, the difficulty of doing two or more shows and the increased booth rentals, which -- at $50 a square foot in most cases -- are now double or triple the rates a year ago.
Milly McGehee, a Baltimore dealer who specializes in American furniture and joined the show a year ago with her partner, Stiles Colwill, said the rent for her booth tripled at this show. "It's a tough year for them to have increased the booth rents," she said.
 But is it not only because of the vetting issue that Mr. Buatta is leaving; there are other reasons.
"I realized this show was never going to work out the way I had hoped it would years ago," he said. "What didn't work out was making it a more international show."
In terms of the items shown, the show is far less international now than in the past. All seven dealers who offered French and Continental furnishings at last year's fair have left. The one replacement, DeRempich Gallery, is a relative newcomer to the antiques field. Dmitry Jodidio, who heads that gallery, has been a dealer in French antiques, specializing in the Empire period, since 1987.
The show's largest category -- Americana -- will include 21 dealers, seven of whom are new to the show.
Despite Mr. Buatta's planned departure, his imprint on the show will remain for years to come in the form of an altered floor plan. Under this plan, an additional aisle is added to the layout, and the larger booths are shallower -- down to 12 feet deep from 20 feet deep. Anthony G. Victoria, who heads Frederick P. Victoria & Son, a French furniture dealer, left the show when he learned that no booth would be deeper than 12 feet.
"It's going to look like a flea market," he said. "Any show where you can walk down the aisle and see everything in the booth as you pass, and have no inducement to walk in to see things better, is like a flea market."
Another French furniture dealer, Garrick Stephenson left the show after 31 years for several reasons. "I think the economic conditions don't warrant spending that kind of money, since the show has lost so many quality people," he said.
Ms. McGehee remains optimistic about the future of the Winter Antiques Show. "Even if we don't do business at this show, to be in it is the best advertisement you can have," she said. "The Winter Antiques Show is still the most exciting show."

HEADLINE: TV VIEW;
A Very Model of a Modern Major Mini-Series

BYLINE: By John J. O'Connor

 BODY:
Turning 20 this month, public television's "Masterpiece Theater" will be feted from coast to coast, more or less, with elaborate tributes planned in Los Angeles and Washington. Hearty congratulations are certainly in order.
The series, consisting largely of imports from Britain, has compiled an enviable record in bringing a touch of class to a prime-time schedule that in 1971 was dominated almost exclusively by action-adventures, westerns and sitcoms. "Masterpiece Theater" institutionalized the mini-series, or "serialized dramatization" -- generally running from 5 to 13 hours -- perhaps television's most original and exclusive programming vehicle. 
 For a variety of reasons, the form is not being used in abundance these days. What the American networks usually label a mini-series is too often only a long movie, presented in two parts and running, minus commercials, for less than three and a half hours. But, if not entirely well, the mini-series is still very much alive.
Coming up on "Masterpiece Theater" in March is the four-part series "House of Cards," with a plot that quite by accident paralleled recent developments in Margaret Thatcher's career. Among the productions on tap next season is the four-part "Portrait of a Marriage," based on Nigel Nicholson's biography of his parents, Harold Nicholson and Vita Sackville-West.
The history of "Masterpiece Theater" actually begins in 1970 with public television's presentation of the BBC's 26-part "Forsyte Saga." Its success prompted Christopher Sarson, a Briton working for Boston's WGBH, to suggest that the station find other serialized novels. Fortunately, BBC drama output at the time, under Sean Sutton, was in a remarkably creative period, overseen by executives who had a broad knowledge of literature and the theater.
WGBH officials approached Herbert Schmertz, then Mobil Oil's vice president for public affairs, for underwriting, and a transplanted Briton named Alistair Cooke -- already familiar from the American series "Omnibus" -- was signed up as weekly host. A series of substance was born, making its debut with a decidedly clunky costume drama called "The First Churchills." Comedy troupes everywhere would soon have a new cultural artifact to parody.
"Masterpiece Theater" quickly found its stride in adaptations of Balzac, Dostoyevsky and Henry James. It blossomed further with "Upstairs, Downstairs," an exquisitely crafted soap opera that was an original endeavor not from the BBC but from London Weekend Television. Another triumph, "The Jewel in the Crown" (1985) was a Granada Television production. The series became so synonymous with quality imports that to this day I have trouble remembering that it cannot lay claim to "Brideshead Revisited," another Granada production, which was broadcast on "Great Performances."
The American commercial networks did not fail to notice that something new was happening. Long committed to open-ended series, running until they expired, and periodic single-shot specials, the networks moved gingerly into the mini-series arena with "QBVII" and "Rich Man, Poor Man." Later they would gain both prestige and ratings with such champions as "Roots," "The Winds of War," "The Thorn Birds" and "Lonesome Dove" (being repeated next week on CBS, Sunday and Tuesday through Thursday from 9 to 11 P.M.).
More often, however, Americans were content to stick with the glitzy romps of novels by Judith Krantz or Sidney Sheldon. CBS even tried, and failed, to do an American version of "Upstairs, Downstairs," called "Beacon Hill." And then there was the occasional disaster, such as ABC's "Amerika," inevitably triggering pronouncements that the mini-series was finished.
Intriguingly enough, the form would seem perfectly suited to established film makers who want to work in television but who are unable to devote all their time and attention to a long-term project. David Lynch and John Sayles are among current examples. As a 12-part mini-series, "Twin Peaks" could have been a tightly contained masterpiece instead of a drawn-out exercise in meandering improvisation.
Admittedly, the mini-series is in trouble, and the reasons are almost wholly economic. An ambitious production, on the level of a "Jewel in the Crown," is almost prohibitively expensive. And the markets in syndication and world sales are limited, or at least not as quickly rewarding as for more popular, easy-to-digest fare. One result can be heard in the current international buzzing about co-productions. Now, more and more, British and American producers are likely to undertake a major mini-series effort only with a consortium of worldwide partners.
The "Masterpiece Theater" costume dramas of old do indeed seem to be relics of the past. Rebecca Eaton, executive producer for WGBH, puts it this way: "We have taken the risk of reinventing ourselves on the air." Why? It is argued that, as new and younger executives -- not to mention audiences -- come on the line in British television, there simply isn't much interest in fine dramatizations of the classics.
Whatever the reason, the "Masterpiece Theater" schedule is increasingly veering toward self-contained presentations -- Maggie Smith in "Talking Heads: Bed Among the Lentils" and Eileen Atkins in "A Room of One's Own," among the best of them -- or more contemporary stories such as (again the best) "A Very British Coup" and "Traffik." Last year, "Masterpiece Theater" presented for the first time a film that had previously been shown in theaters: "The Dressmaker," with Joan Plowright and Billie Whitelaw.
One encouraging development: audience numbers for the series are up a bit from year-ago levels. But one foreboding danger is that the series will take its eye off the quality ball. The prospect of international productions put together by committee does not augur well for independent visions and uncompromising standards. A French-English co-production of "A Tale of Two Cities" and the British-Japanese version of "The Ginger Tree," both seen on "Masterpiece Theater," did not inspire an abundance of confidence about the future.
"Masterpiece Theater" itself has established a record that will be difficult to match, never mind top. Beginning tonight at 9:30 on Channel 13 with three vintage episodes of "Upstairs, Downstairs," the program will over the next several Sundays present a sampler of past triumphs. On tap are single episodes from "The Six Wives of Henry VIII," "I, Claudius" and "The Jewel in the Crown," plus such self-contained presentations as "On Approval," with Penelope Keith and Jeremy Brett, and "A Dedicated Man" with Alec McCowen and Miss Plowright. The reminders of what can be done, and has been done, in television drama are bracing.

 BODY:
When Jack Lane took over as director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art three years ago, one of the first things he did was shut his office door. "The previous director's door was open to everyone who wanted to talk to him," Mr. Lane explains. "That just seemed unworkable. I wanted to clarify the chain of command, so we divided the museum into four major areas, and the heads of those areas report directly to me."
It was the kind of tough-minded decision the museum's trustees had hired Mr. Lane, who holds a master's degree in business from the University of Chicago as well as a Ph. D. from Harvard, to make. They wanted a director with a degree in business as well as art to lead the museum through a period of major expansion. 
 Their choice is representative of a growing perception that leadership at museums requires business acumen as well as connoisseurship. Although business management techniques have been used in museums for at least two decades, in the last few years those skills have been more heavily emphasized -- to the dismay of some in the art world.
 While many cultural institutions have long had business departments to take care of marketing, public relations and accounting functions, the emphasis at the top had been on scholarship. But now, at some major museums, even directors are being chosen for their business training as well as for their fine arts backgrounds.
Perhaps the most conspicuous, and controversial, appointment has been that of Thomas Krens at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. The 43-year-old director, who has a master's degree in business from the Yale School of Management, has come under criticism for his plans to create a multinational museum with branches in this country and abroad, and for selling paintings from the museum's permanent collection to buy newer works.
 Museums run by art historians are also making increasing use of modern management techniques. "You have to know how to negotiate with unions, hire contractors, run a restaurant and a bookstore," says Patterson Sims, associate director of the Seattle Art Museum, who does not hold an M.B.A. "Those are not issues that connoisseurship prepares you for.
To help meet the demand, several of the country's best business schools -- Harvard, Yale, Stanford and the University of California at Los Angeles -- offer courses in arts management. And the American Federation of Arts, a New York-based service organization that offers both exhibitions and professional training to 600 member museums, runs a summer program to train museum curators in business administration.
Perhaps not surprisingly, this mingling of art and business tends to polarize the museum world. "Administrative imperatives are taking precedence over artistic judgments," says Hilton Kramer, art critic and editor of The New Criterion, a magazine of cultural criticism. Others disagree. "A well-run operation should free the curator," counters Graham W. J. Beal, director of the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, who made the jump from curator to administrator after participating in the American Federation of Arts' training program.
Whether they see it as a blessing or a curse, there is widespread agreement that a business orientation in museums is here to stay. "It's not a question of whether it will happen," says Roger M. Berkowitz, deputy director of the Toledo Museum of Art. "It is happening."
 
The Changing Profile Of the Curator
 According to museum professionals, the trend is linked to the increased size and complexity of many art institutions.
"Museums are demonstrably more complex," says J. Carter Brown, director of the National Gallery in Washington and perhaps the first museum head to combine a joint M.B.A.-art history track as a calculated career strategy. He decided to take a business degree from Harvard while pursuing a master's degree in art history at the Institute of Fine Arts in New York. "When I became director in 1970," says Mr. Brown, "we had 350 employees. Now we have 1,000. Back then the museum was all in one building; we have doubled the space. Our budget was $5.9 million in 1970; today it's $53.9 million.
"My predecessor's fund-raising activities were simple," he continued. "He had lunch with Ailsa Mellon, and if he needed a Leonardo she would write the check." During Mr. Brown's tenure, the National Gallery has raised $40 million from 92 corporations.
As a result of such changes, the profile of the typical museum director has changed since the mid-70's. Directors of the old school tended to be socially prominent connoisseurs, as knowledgeable in wooing wealthy collectors as in evaluating art. "It was a hobby," says Thomas Hoving, director of the Metropolitan Museum from 1967 to 1977 and now editor in chief of Connoisseur magazine. "When I first got out of graduate school, people told me that the biggest prerequisite for becoming a curator was an outside income."
Although Mr. Hoving has no degree in business (nor does his successor, Philippe de Montebello), many credit -- or blame -- him for starting the focus on business in museums. "It was during Hoving's tenure at the Met that museums became broad, popular institutions, with blockbuster shows, expanded education programs, gift shops, bookstores and restaurants maximizing income," says Mr. Lane, who has raised more than $65 million for the San Francisco museum and will double its exhibition space with a new building.
 
The Blockbuster: A Catch-22
 Many museums grew rapidly on a steady diet of big exhibitions and expanding staff, membership and budget. But in many ways, museums have become the victims of their own success. The cost of buying, insuring, shipping and storing art has lifted blockbusters beyond the means of most institutions. "The cost of some of these shows is mind-boggling," says Steven A. Nash, associate director and chief curator of the De Young and Legion of Honor Museums in San Francisco, who spent a year at Stanford business school before getting his Ph. D. in art history. "In one recent exhibition I know of, it cost $100,000 just to insure one painting. We have had to say no to some blockbuster shows."
Without any major exhibitions in the last few years, the De Young and Legion of Honor have seen attendance drop from about 800,000 in 1988, the year of the Andrew Wyeth "Helga" show, to about 550,000 in 1989. "We have really had to streamline the institution, cut people by attrition and eliminate any redundancies," says Mr. Nash.
The Toledo Museum of Art went through a similar drought, in which annual attendance dropped from 493,000 in 1983, when it put on a major El Greco show, to 280,000 last year. Along with a 15 percent budget cut, the Toledo Museum has devised another solution to its problems. Borrowing a concept from the business world, it has formed a "consortium" with museums in St. Louis, Kansas City, Minneapolis and Pittsburgh, to mount a major Impressionist exhibition that none of them could have afforded otherwise. The show has broken attendance records at the museums.
Last year the Minneapolis Institute of Art hired Daniel E. O'Leary as deputy director, in part because of his experience in turning around a financially troubled museum. After earning a joint Ph. D. and M.B.A. at the University of Michigan, Mr. O'Leary became director of Artrain, a Michigan-based regional museum that presents traveling exhibitions in a railroad car. "I applied classical business school analysis," he says. "We booked exhibitions of greater appeal, extended the touring schedule to create a greater economy of scale. We managed to more than double the revenues and cut expenses by a third, and the audience went from 40,000 annually to 130,000."
One of the first things he did at Minneapolis was to conduct a market survey. "We live in a competitive world. We have to justify ourselves to government, to foundations, to corporations."
Some critics of the trend toward a business mentality fear that museums' preoccupation with attendance is inimical to their artistic purpose. "Museums are market-driven," says Hilton Kramer. "Museum directors have become salesmen."
Others insist that ignoring the bottom line can jeopardize a museum's artistic mission.
"A number of museums have become more or less insolvent," says Myrna Smoot, director of the American Federation of Arts. "They reduce their hours, they don't change their collection, they reduce maintenance and security, stop paying to conserve the collection, in order to keep the doors open."
 
Does Thank You Mean Forever?
 The problem of continual growth is one that preoccupies Mr. Krens at the Guggenheim, the most outspoken advocate of the so-called M.B.A. revolution, who has sought to challenge the assumptions on which museums have traditionally operated. "It's increasingly expensive to store and preserve works of art," he says. "When you accept an object into your collection, do you take on an obligation to preserve that work forever?" Older museums, he says, are at a critical juncture; they cannot continue indefinitely as both custodians of the past and purveyors of the new. "Do you go on collecting forever? And if not, where do you stop?"
Mr. Krens clearly answered his own question with his decision to sell a Kandinsky, a Modigliani and a Klee last year to pay for a major collection of Minimalist art from the Italian Count Giuseppe Panza.
Among Mr. Krens's ambitions are to expand the New York Guggenheim building, push forward the on-again, off-again project to establish a contemporary art museum in North Adams, Mass., and to supervise international Guggenheim outposts, including one in the Panza villa near Milan. Mr. Krens even has a possible business solution for the spiraling cost of conserving works of art. "We have talked about selling the maintenance of works of art. Let donors select works of art they want to pay to maintain and we will put their name on the wall label. It introduces a certain shopping quality to it."
Most M.B.A.-curators warn against taking the trend too far. "If M.B.A.'s are running museums without an art-history background, we're in for a grim future," says Mr. Nash. "You have to have people who can think with both sides of their brain."
For the moment, anyway, the low wage scale of the not-for-profit world insures to some degree that the M.B.A.'s entering the museum world will have to be passionate about more than money.
 
 
 
A Degree From Disneyworld
 Thomas Hoving, former director of the Metropolitan Museum, does not mind being seen as the harbinger of the current wave of M.B.A.'s in museums. "I didn't just bring in one M.B.A.," he said of his tenure at the Met. "I brought in about 25 M.B.A.'s. After I'd been director about a month, I realized that the curators knew absolutely nothing about administration. One department had more employees than 90 percent of all other museums in the United States.
Mr. Hoving has little regret for having disrupted the genteel, old-fashioned atmosphere that prevailed at the Met. "The good old days weren't so marvelous at all," he says. "Museums were run by badly paid lackeys of rich trustees.
In preparing the blockbuster shows that became his trademark, Mr. Hoving says he learned a great deal from the business world. "When we built a new wing for the museum, we spent a lot of time in airline terminals to study how to move crowds of people around. The first thing you see when you walk into the Met is not art but happy, smiling faces behind a brass information counter. We learned that from Disneyworld: they are masters in hospitality, in making people feel glad they came.
"Anybody in the museum world who hasn't spent time at Disneyworld is making a big mistake."

HEADLINE: Parks That Preserve the Old Hawaii

BYLINE: By ROBERT LINDSEY; ROBERT LINDSEY is former chief West Coast correspondent for The Times.

 BODY:
MILES -- and sometimes centuries, it seems -- from the posh resorts with swimming pools measured in fractions of an acre, which have been rising near almost every sandy beach in the state recently, another Hawaii is surviving, preserved by state and Federal park agencies.
During the last two decades or so, as its basic commodities -- sugar cane and pineapple -- have declined in importance on world markets because of new international competition, Hawaii has been forced to turn increasingly to tourism to support its economy. 
 The result has been great change. Before it became a state in 1959, and for a time after that, most of Hawaii's visitors were well-heeled and arrived by luxury ship, and there were a handful of grand hotels scattered along Honolulu's Waikiki Beach, whose South Seas ambiance stirred the pens of writers from Mark Twain to Somerset Maugham to James Michener. The advent of the jumbo jet and the lower air fares it made possible lured millions of middle-income tourists from the mainland. Now, except for one stretch of beach preserved by the Federal Government, there's hardly an inch of Waikiki not flanked by high-rise hotels, condominiums and other threatening walls of concrete, and one of the city's perennial political issues is whether it should spend hundreds of millions of dollars to build a rail rapid transit system to decongest motor vehicle traffic that, at its worse, ranks with the rush-hour jams of many cities on the mainland.
Maui, second largest of the Hawaiian Islands (after the island of Hawaii, usually referred to as the Big Island), was next to feel the impact of increased tourism and population growth: As more and more people sought escape from the urbanization of Oahu, columns of luxury hotels and condominiums began to rise along its shores, jumbo jet service was instituted directly from the mainland, and now Maui, too, is wrestling with serious road congestion and other problems of urban growth.
Even on the Big Island and the island of Kauai, perhaps the state's most beautiful, there has been population growth and a surge of resort and condominium construction. As a result, vestiges of what locals call Old Hawaii -- the pre-statehood Polynesia ofempty beaches and rain forests, of whaling
 ports, quiet plantation towns, and a slow-paced, sun-soaked territorial way of life -- are getting harder and harder to find.
Yet, many traces of Old Hawaii can still be found, in part because the resources of state and Federal taxpayers have preserved more than 60 parks around the state, ranging from small roadside enclaves to remote jungle recreation areas accessible only to the most dedicated backpacker. Several of the parks offer modest overnight cabin accommodations (in addition to campgrounds) that may be among the better travel bargains in the country, with rates as low as $14 a night.
Following is a report on several selected parks on Kauai, Maui and the Big Island, with emphasis on those that are most easily accessible by car and have overnight accommodations.
A complete list of the state's parks is available from the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of State Parks, Post Office Box 621, Honolulu, Hawaii 96809; (808) 548-7455.
 
Kauai
Seated in front of the blazing lava-stone fireplace in the bar of the Kokee Lodge in Kokee State Park, visitors may easily forget they are not in the Rocky Mountains. A crisp mountain chill outside often heightens the illusion.
Not far away, however, are lush rain forests that are among the most beautiful in the Pacific. At the edge of an alpine meadow some 3,600 feet above sea level, the lodge is in the heart of Hawaii's most rugged mountain scenery, about 90 minutes' drive from many of the island's major hotels. Although much of the year the weather at the summit is tropically warm, conditions are unpredictable and visitors are wise to bring a sweater or rain-repellent jacket .
 From State Highway 540, which crosses a coastal plain in the southern part of Kauai, turn north near the town of Waimea (where the British navigator Capt. James Cook landed in 1778) via either the Waimea Canyon Drive or Highway 550.
After climbing about 11 miles, past vast fields of sugar cane set against the retreating backdrop of the Pacific, you will reach several turnouts for automobiles on the right side of the road that lead you to the rim of Waimea Canyon. Mark Twain called this vast gorge of jagged red and rose colored peaks, valleys and distant waterfalls "the Grand Canyon of the Pacific." Its beauty is enhanced by its seeming incongruity in the center of a tropical island.
At the roadside look-outs, visitors are likely to have their first meeting with one of Hawaii's most distinctive animals -- the moa, a wild red jungle fowl festooned with brilliant iridescent plumage, which is descended from birds brought via outrigger canoe to Hawaii by Polynesian explorers centuries ago. Once abundant throughout the islands, the untamed but friendly chickens now survive principally in the high country of Kauai.
After skirting the edge of Waimea Canyon, passing the entrance to a NASA space tracking station, Highway 550 continues past Kokee Lodge and ends, 19 miles from the town of Waimea, on a 4,000-foot-high plateau with another spellbinding vista: the jungles and meadows of the sweeping Kalalau Valley and, beyond it, the fluted cliffs of Kauai's Na Pali Coast.
 A dozen modest cabins, furnished with linens, refrigerators, stoves and basic cooking utensils, are available at the Kokee Lodge (Post Office Box 819, Waimea, Kauai, Hawaii 96798, [808] 335-6061 for reservations), for $35 to $45 nightly, plus 9.1 percent tax. The cabins accommodate from three to seven people.
The lodge's restaurant is open for lunch seven days a week, with dinner served Fridays and Saturdays only. Its specialties include a dish that is popular in Hawaii, Portuguese sausage and bean soup ($4.50). More ambitious items, such as roast Cornish game hen, also are on the menu. Dinner for two costs about $60.
While sun-bathing, dining and Polynesian music revues generally take center stage at Hawaii's beach resorts, the emphasis in the high country of Kauai is on leisurely exploration of a tropical wilderness, hiking and keeping an eye out for the distinctive flowers, trees, birds and other wildlife, such as wild pigs, deer and feral goats. In late June and early July, thousands of wild Methley plum trees ripen in the Kokee State Park and adjacent Waimea Canyon State park, providing a succulent bounty for hikers. And for visitors who are so inclined, permits can be secured for trout fishing and hunting wild boar.
Maps detailing more than 40 miles of trails into Waimea Canyon and surrounding forests, some of the walks not overly challenging , can be obtained at the lodge or park headquarters nearby.
Hikers throughout Hawaii are advised to take sunscreen, a protective hat and a quart of water , and to register their route at the park headquarters before leaving. Swimming or drinking from rivers and streams is not recommended: Kauai's waterways are infected with leptospirosis, a waterborne disease that produces high fever, chills and nausea.
Besides Kokee Lodge, privately owned Kahili Mountain Park ([808] 742-9921), a mile off Highway 50, one of the island's major arteries, offers modest, get-away-from-it-all cabins in the mountains. A cabin for two with private bath costs $38.15 nightly, cabinettes without private bath rent for $21.80.
The private park is near some of Kauai's most easily accessible tropical scenery: At Wailua River State Park bordering State Highway 56 visitors can ride a riverboat past a rain forest to a huge "fern grotto," a cave filled with vivid green maidenhair ferns. Also nearby are several scenic waterfalls, including Wailua Falls and Opaekaa Falls, which plunge out of the jungle and cascade to deep pools beneath them.
 At the northern end of Kauai, beyond the rural Hanalei Valley and Hanalei Town, there is a trail-head at Haena State Beach Park that takes hikers a mile and a half to the edge of the Na Pali Coast State Park; hikers are rewarded with views of the 15-mile stretch of craggy, primitive volcanic bluffs. Park officials say only experienced overnight hikers should go beyond this point and enter the 11-mile Kalalau Trail, which, following a route high among the towering bluffs, takes them into the heart of the park, a wonderland of lush valleys and plunging waterfalls.
 
Maui
Few communities have managed to retain the atmosphere of Old Hawaii better than Hana on the eastern coast of Maui, perhaps because getting there is so difficult.
 Although air taxi service has been available in recent years, automobile travel from other parts of the island has long been discouraged by the obstacle of a narrow, often tortuous 52-mile road of switchbacks, blind curves and single-lane bridges between Hana and the island's main jetport at Kahului.
 For those who make the three-hour drive and with a reservation in hand for one of the 12 cabins at the Waianapanapa State Park in Hana, the payoff can be an unparalleled, no-frills respite from urban life in a wild Polynesian setting.
The cabins rent for $14 a night, with a five-day limit. They tend to be booked several months in advance, with weekends most in demand. Reservations are made through the Division of Parks office in Maui (Post Office Box 1049, Wailuku, Hawaii 96793; [808] 243-5354).
Within the 120-acre park is a dense tropical forest, a treasure of temple ruins and archeological finds that bring Hawaii's past to life, a beach of volcanic black sand, trails and underwater caves and lava tubes that are the topics of island lore and legend. Most visitors, at least once, hike 3 miles along the rugged shoreline to Hana Town to buy a cone of fruit-flavored shaved ice -- an island tradition -- or visit a Hana landmark and the town's gossip-central, Hasegawa's General Store.
A different kind of experience, one at a higher altitude, awaits travelers not many miles from Hana, at Haleakala National Park, the site of a enormous volcanic crater that last erupted about 1790.
Standing at the rim of the crater more than 10,000 feet above sea level, visitors gaze out at an undulating moonscape of mountains and valleys that stretch for eight miles, a vast bowl painted red, pink, brown, yellow and other shades that change with the hour, the movement of the sun and the timeless movement of clouds overhead.
By tradition, the most popular moment to see Haleakala -- which in Hawaiian means House of the Sun -- is sunrise, when a ball of fire suddenly materializes at the eastern lip of the crater and explodes with a fiery brilliance that suggests the beginning of time.
Still, the panorama is stunning any hour when the crater is not totally covered by a layer of clouds, which occurs not infrequently. Before driving to Haleakala, it's a good idea to check with the Park Service at (808) 572-7749 regarding the weather and sightseeing conditions at the summit of the crater.
Driving to the park, which takes about two hours from most of Maui's principal resort areas, is as enjoyable as seeing the crater. State Highway 37 ascends Mount Haleakala through what Hawaiians call Maui's Upcountry, a bucolic area on the slopes of the volcano of pastoral farms and cattle ranches, where wild plumeria, protea and other flowers flourish and the rolling terrain is often reminiscent of the Chiltern Hills in Britain.
The Halimaile General Store ([808] 572-2666), a restored former pineapple plantation company store, is a pleasant place for a meal en route to or from the crater. Set amid cane and pineapple fields in the tiny hamlet of Halimaile two miles off Highway 37, the restaurant is run by Joe Gannon, a producer of concerts for rock stars such as Alice Cooper and Barry Manilow before he and his wife, Beverly, decided to move to Maui. Their menu features items such as blackened sashimi and roast duck with maple pecan sauce. Dinner for two: about $75.
Throughout the Upcountry, often waiting to be discovered on rural backroads by chance, are countless churches built by some of the missionaries who flocked to Hawaii during the 19th century. One example is the Church of the Holy Ghost near the town of Waiakoa. Also worth a visit is the nearby town of Makawao whose weathered wooden buildings (some of them converted to boutiques and art galleries) have the look of the Old West, befitting its role as a center of cattle ranching, and Paia, an old sugar processing town now filled with arts and crafts shops, some of them opened by mainland dropouts who a generation ago were called hippies.
A fee of $3 is charged each car entering the Haleakala National Park. Although many visitors are content to enjoy the view from the rim of the crater, others go into it, taking either a one-mile self-guided tour along a marked path or a hike that can last up to several days; guided trail rides into the crater are organized by a horseback riding concession at a cost of about $100.
The National Park Service makes available, by lottery, an opportunity to spend up to three nights in the crater at three government-owned cabins, an experience some former visitors have compared with overnighting on the moon. Four, 6 and 10 miles, respectively, from the lip of the crater, the cabins are equipped with a stove, bunks for up to 12 people, blankets, limited water and firewood, and cooking utensils. The charge is $2.50 a night for each person, with a minimum of $15 for each cabin.
At least 60 days before the proposed trip, travelers who want to stay in one of the cabins are required to submit their names and the date of their visit to the Park Superintendent, Haleakala National Park, Post Office Box 369, Makawao, Hawaii 96768, (808) 572-9306,; park rangers say travelers who offer several alternative dates are most likely to be selected for a reservation.
For people who want to spend a night near the crater under less Spartan conditions, the Kula Lodge (808) 878-2517, is on the slopes of Mount Haleakala. Rates are $120 to $140 nightly for two .
 
The Big Island
The Kalopa State Recreation Area is tucked into a mountainside tropical forest at an altitude of 2,200 feet midway between two of the Big Island's major population centers, Hilo and Kailua-Kona.
Within its 100 acres and adjoining 515-acre state forest are specimens of virtually all of Hawaii's native plants. The park is three miles inland from State Highway 19 and five miles southeast of the town of Honokaa. Cabins rent for $2.50 a person a night, with a minimum of $14, including linens. Cooking facilities are available. For reservations contact the State Division of Parks, 75 Apuni Street, Hilo, Hawaii 96720; (808) 933-4200.
Within a short drive of Kalopa are several plantation towns, such as Paauilo and Honokaa, whose narrow streets are lined with wooden buildings. Also nearby is Akaka Falls State Park. Five miles off the main highway, the falls plunge 420 feet over a mossy cliff into Kolekole Stream amid a lush jungle of azaleas, orchids, ferns and ginger trees.
 After spending the night at the edge of a rain forest, visitors need drive only 70 miles to spend a night not far from a hissing, lava-spewing volcano, at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, (808) 967-7311, the site of two of the world's most active volcanoes, Kilauea and Mauna Loa. The volcanic activity is intermittent; a National Park Service telephone line, (808) 967 7977, provides up to date information on eruptions. The park can be toured by car in roughly half a day. A $5 entry fee is charged at the gate. The Visitors Information Center, (808) 967-7311 , provides maps with walks from 1 to 11 miles.
At the Volcano House, (808) 967-7321, the hotel at the park, rates range from $75 a night to $125 for a room with a crater view. Volcano House handles reservations for cabins in remote sections of the park that rent for $24 nightly.

HEADLINE: It's Not Just Steak or Poi Anymore

BYLINE: By ROBERT LINDSEY

 BODY:
ASKED four or five years ago to define the ingredients of Hawaiian cuisine, many of that state's chefs would have listed local fish, pineapple, mangoes, coconut and poi, the starchy paste pressed from the root of the taro plant that has long been a fixture at island luau dinners.
At that time, ordinary residents of this multicultural melting pot enjoyed the flavors of Japan, China, Korea, Thailand, Portugal, the Philippines and other countries. But visitors, at most hotels and island resorts were offered a mainland diet of steak, prime rib and baked potato, frozen lobster tail and, occasionally, more ambitious Continental-style dishes bathed in cream and butter, or the ubiquitous luau. 
 Those days are gone. A new generation of young resort and restaurant chefs is offering sophisticated menus that combine classic European methods of preparation with the flavors and cuisine of Pacific Rim countries -- dishes such as fresh ahi (yellow fin) tuna seared and blackened in a wok and served barely cooked, like Japanese sashimi; steamed clams with Chinese black bean sauce; carpaccio of beef with red chili lentils; shitake and brie won tons with escargot and candied shallots; rack of lamb cooked slowly in the smoke of guava wood and Hawaiian coffee beans and served with wild poha berries and taro root pancakes.
"The changes I've seen since I came to Hawaii in 1983 are incredible," said Peter Merriman, the 34-year-old owner-chef of Merriman's, a well-regarded restaurant in the town of Waimea on the Big Island of Hawaii. "At that time, everybody was using frozen food and trying to emulate Europe; now, everything's got to be fresh and there's a blending of Pacific cultures that I don't think you see anyplace else. It's a new regional cuisine."
Dinner at Merriman's might start with an appetizer of locally produced goat cheese baked in phyllo dough or a slice of tender white fish from local waters that has been flavored by a marinade composed of coconut milk, lime juice and Maui onions. Among the choice of entrees are herb-roasted chicken served with a zinfandel-papaya sauce; a melange of shrimp and scallops served with a light Thai yellow curry, and one of the best examples of rare wok-seared ahi.
To a large extent, the renaissance in Hawaiian cooking is part of broader culinary trends that have occurred around the country during the past decade, changes that have placed new emphasis on using fresh, creatively prepared local food instead of processed or frozen foods; lightly broiled and grilled meats and fish; lighter sauces (if any sauce at all is used), and a general shift toward lighter, fresher foods.
What's different in Hawaii is a much stronger Asian influence than on the mainland, along with the availability of fruits, vegetables, herbs, spices and seafood not usually found elsewhere. The new Hawaiian cuisine uses not only such familiar Hawaiian products as coconut, guavas and mangoes, but also berries, squash, hibiscus leaves, seaweed and other ingredients not routinely available on the mainland.

 AND after years of often-difficult experimentation with such ocean farming techniques as pumping very cold water from the ocean's depths to provide a nurturing environment for seafood not normally found in tropical waters, aquaculture entrepreneurs in Hawaii are now turning out commercial quantities of many species from the deep sea: high quality prawns; abalone similar to the delicious pink shellfish that was once plentiful along the California coast; King salmon similar to fish native to the Pacific Northwest, and even "Maine" lobster. Coming soon, the entrepreneurs say: sea bass, trout, talapia, Belon oysters and "Dover sole" they say will taste very much like the fish netted in the cold waters of the English Channel.
"Almost everything I use now is a local ingredient -- at least 90 percent," said George Mavrothalassitis, a classically trained French chef from Marseilles who oversees the respected, expensive Le Mer restaurant in the Halekulani Hotel in Honolulu.
During the last three or four years, he said, Hawaiian farmers, responding to requests from local chefs, have taken advantage of the islands' seemingly omnipresent sun to produce a previously unavailable cornucopia of herbs, spices and vegetables, including sweet corn and plump vine-ripened tomatoes. All he misses now, he said, is locally produced foie gras and truffles.
Le Mer overlooks Diamond Head and the Pacific Ocean from one of the most beautiful spots on Waikiki Beach. Although classic European dishes are on his menu, Mr. Mavrothalassitis puts emphasis on island fish, which is often served with a sauce made from such indigenous ingredients as seaweed.
George Gomes Jr., the 28-year-old chef at the Garden Restaurant at the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel on the Big Island of Hawaii, said: "I think it's just in the past two or three years that cooks here have begun to realize how much Hawaii has to offer -- not only produce and other ingredients, but the variety of cultural influences we can choose from -- Korean, Thai, Japanese, Chinese and others. Suddenly, everything is coming together; they're all being blended into what we call this new regional cuisine."
He said the island chefs still generally used the basic European style taught to them in culinary schools, but modified it with unconventional ingredients: a beurre blanc sauce, for example, is prepared in the classical manner, but incorporates less butter and ingredients such as sesame oil, miso (soy bean paste), wasabi (a type of Japanese horseradish) or sweet onions grown on the mountain slopes of Maui.
Elements of several Asian cultures are often combined in unconventional ways, he said, as in an appetizer he prepares called Firecracker Salmon -- a six-inch cylinder-shaped piece of farm-raised Hawaiian salmon that is wrapped in Chinese cabbage, dried seaweed and a thin crepe popular among Filipino residents of Hawaii and served with a hot and sour chili dip. His other specialties include island-raised abalone served with Kuki nuts and a Tahitian lime-caviar sauce, and ocean-farmed Hawaiian King salmon glazed with a Hoisen pineapple sauce. Like many of Hawaii's new chefs, Mr. Gomes takes pains not to overcook seafood and, unless ordered otherwise, usually serves it tender and medium rare.
Although there is not a consensus on who invented the new Hawaiian cuisine, many cooks credit the Honolulu chef Roy Yamaguchi with having a major influence in it. After developing a large following at a restaurant in Los Angeles where he successfully combined French and Asian culinary influences, Mr. Yamaguchi opened Roy's restaurant in Hawaii Kai, a Honolulu suburb, two years ago. It offered a similar menu that won plaudits from diners and was subsequently emulated by a number of other chefs.
Constantly experimenting, Mr. Yamaguchi changes his menu frequently. A recent $30 prix-fixe menu included a warm appetizer of smoked baked salmon served with a watercress sauce, a shrimp salad served with a hot Thai sauce, roasted duck in a cognac-Madeira sauce, and desert.
Another force in the emergence of the new culinary style was Roger Dikon, executive chef at the Prince Hotel on Maui. When the Maui Prince opened in 1986, he said, he was given a blank check by the management to design a menu for its largest restaurant, the Prince Court, and decided to break from what he called traditional hotel food then common at island resorts, many of which were operated by large chains.
 Impressed by the culinary ferment in California, where many chefs were turning their backs on European tradition, Mr. Dikon said he set out to emulate some of the best California cooks; but he said he soon discovered, in a state whose economic strength had long been based on agriculture -- sugar cane and pineapple -- many of the products that were routinely available to California chefs couldn't be found here. "The only kind of lettuce you could get was Romaine and butter lettuce and no one grew fresh basil," he said.
In his backyard, Mr. Dikon planted 11 varieties of lettuce, 6 varieties of basil and many other herbs and vegetables and he began serving them in the new restaurant. Since then, he has managed to find farmers willing to sell the items to him, and he has acquired a reputation as one of the brightest innovators among the new generation of chefs in Hawaii. His specialties include black bean soup with country ham, duck, sausage and garnished with salsa, spiced cashews and bananas; blackened ahi with a salsa of Japanese cucumber, mirin (a sweet Japanese wine) and mint, and duck confit and pan-roasted breast of lamb served with candied figs and sun-dried cranberries.
Already, the new Hawaiian cuisine can be sampled on virtually every major island in the state. A partial list of some of the islands' other better known chefs includes:
* Alan Wong of the Canoehouse in the Hotel Mauna Lani on the Big Island; his specialties include blackened ahi and other island fish.
* Jean Marie Josselin, proprietor of A Pacific Cafe in the Kauai Village shopping center in Kapaa. He also features seafood, which is seasoned with a rainbow of flavors from many Pacific Rim countries. One example: stir-fried scallops with lemon grass and black bean sauce.
* Jeff Wind, of Bagwells 2424 at the Hyatt Regency Waikiki in Honolulu. He uses pineapple wine made on Maui in several dishes.
* Guy Higa, at the Inn on the Cliffs at the Westin Kauai hotel, who says he apprenticed at an Italian restaurant run by a Japanese cook and has never stopped trying to meld Asian and European cuisines.
* John Farnsworth, of the recently opened Lodge at Koele -- the only resort hotel on an island previously restricted to producing pineapples -- who not only prepares the new Hawaiian-Pacific Rim cuisine, but grows some of his own produce. Recently, he established a piggery to provide raw material for one of his specialties, grilled pork loin marinated in olive oil, pineapple juice and herbs and served with an aioli sauce whose ingredients includes petals from hibiscus flowers.
 * Adi Kohler, president and general manager of the Mauna Kea, a resort built in the 1960's by Laurance S. Rockefeller that is still a standard-setter among the state's luxury hotels, said competition at the top end of the resort market is intensifying. He also said competition was likely to be so keen in the future that resorts will have to have restaurants that can compete on an equal footing with the best on the mainland.
Affluent vacationers, he said, have come to expect higher standards from their restaurants at home and won't settle for conventional hotel food when they travel. The relative quality of resort restaurants, he said, will become increasingly important in the competition for customers.
"There are some very good restaurants in Hawaii now, but I think it's only beginning," Mr. Merriman said.

Post-Modern Kisses and Other Ideas

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER

 BODY:
Since we ended 1990 with a look back, it seems appropriate to start 1991 with a look ahead. The outlook, to be sure, is gloomy: The new year begins with a depressed economy, not a single trendy new style to distract us, and not even a new architectural celebrity on the horizon. What can follow a year in which Peter Eisenman, the master of obtuse architectural theorizing, reached such heights of media fame that he was profiled in Vanity Fair? Herewith a few events that may happen in the world of architecture in 1991 -- or may not. 
 Jan. 20: Prince Charles announces the appointment of Ralph Lauren as chief architect and city planner for London, stating that he represents the platonic marriage of popular taste and respect for history that the Prince has been seeking. Mr. Lauren says he is honored to accept the position, and immediately announces plans to convert the Queen's House, the classical gem by Inigo Jones in Greenwich, into the Prince's personal Polo shop. Leon Krier, the classicist who has been designing a new village for the Prince in Dorset, retires to Florida in bewilderment.
Feb. 5: Philip Johnson and John Burgee, architects of the four skyscrapers that are to be the centerpiece of the Times Square redevelopment project, first announced in 1981 and still unbuilt, unveil yet another version of the project. After starting out with stone-and-glass buildings with mansard roofs and moving on to "deconstructivist" towers full of anxious angles, this time they try simple glass boxes. "It's all over, all this fancy nonsense," says Mr. Johnson. "I've just discovered this wonderful old architect named Mies van der Rohe, and his work is ripe for the picking." Architecture critics retire to their word processors in bewilderment.
Feb. 14: Michael Graves, who has designed teapots, shopping bags, fabrics and address books, announces a line of chocolates."There is no reason why architects cannot bring their special talents to bear in the important arena of Valentine's Day," Mr. Graves states. His rust-colored chocolates are in the shape of a classical column topped by a heart.
March 15: Donald Trump announces that Trump City, his vast project on the Hudson River on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, has finally been "certified," declared ready by the New York City Planning Commission to begin the official review process leading to final approval. How a builder with a nearly negative net worth could actually put up the world's tallest building in a city with a real-estate market so depressed that no one can sell a studio apartment is not explained. But Mr. Trump says he intends to plunge ahead, and promises an end to the recession if approvals for Trump City are granted.
April 15: The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designates a shelter for the homeless as its first "depression landmark," stating that "a city has a responsibility to preserve a full range of its artifacts."
April 24: The J. Paul Getty Trust, parent of the world's richest museum, abruptly cancels the unveiling of plans for its new museum and study center in Los Angeles, an elaborate complex the architect Richard Meier has been designing since 1984. A Getty spokesman explains that the institution doesn't like to rush things, "and anyway, after six years, isn't the suspense at least as much fun as any actual building?"
May 1: Hearings for Trump City begin. Mr. Trump says his project will not only end the recession but stimulate the economy so forcefully that the city's problems with homelessness, education and AIDS will be eradicated. If the project is not approved, Mr. Trump says, he has an alternative in mind that "will give all of you what you deserve."
May 10: The Walt Disney Company, which has become the nation's most aggressive corporate client of serious architecture over the past few years, announces that it has commissioned Peter Eisenman to build a new theme park based on the notion that confusion and angst can be fun.
May 20: Michael Graves announces a new line of architect-designed light bulbs.
May 30: Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the huge architecture firm that dominated corporate architecture in the 50's, 60's, 70's and 80's, announces that it is having a harder time than expected competing in the economy of the 90's, and lays off another 20 architects. Mitsubishi, the vast Japanese industrial enterprise, is rumored to be considering buying Skidmore.
June 20: At another hearing for Trump City, it leaks out that Donald Trump's threatened alternative plan is to continue Riverside Drive southward and fill the 72-acre site with conventional New York City blocks containing medium-sized apartment buildings and row houses, and a riverfront park. Community members, stating that this is what they have wanted all along, are left flustered. "If Donald Trump is willing to do this, what is left for us to complain about?" one of them says of the scheme. Mr. Trump issues a press release calling the plan "my most brilliant idea ever," and says he would have proposed it years before except for his architects, "who were so hung up on that foolish business of putting up the world's tallest building that they couldn't focus on anything else."
July 15: Mitsubishi purchases Skidmore for $3 billion. After the deal closes is it revealed that the Japanese conglomerate went ahead only because it overheard Skidmore partners bragging about the quality of the firm's studio.
Aug: 10: Mitsubishi, unwilling to admit that it had not realized that the studio it was buying was a drafting room and not a movie company, tries to save face by appointing the action-film producer Joel Silver, a well-known architecture buff, as the new head of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.
 Sept. 5: Unwilling to be bettered in the Mitsubishi-Skidmore deal, Michael Ovitz, the head of Hollywood's powerful Creative Artists Agency and the man who put together the purchase of MCA-Universal by Matsushita, tries to sell I. M. Pei, the architect of C.A.A.'s much-acclaimed headquarters building in Beverly Hills, to the Mitsui Corporation, another Japanese conglomerate.
Oct. 15: Michael Graves announces a new line of architect-designed paper clips.
Nov. 1: David Geffen, the entertainment mogul who is a major client of the New York firm of Gwathmey Siegel, buys this purveyor of sleek buildings, saying that it is cheaper for him to own an architecture firm outright than to continue paying it fees. To make the deal more attractive to Gwathmey Siegel, which has just designed a new headquarters for him in Beverly Hills, Mr. Geffen promises to let the architects start designing his record album covers and movie titles.
Nov. 10: The architect, author and teacher Robert A. M. Stern denounces the loss of independence on the part of architecture firms as a "sellout of our mandate to show the world our dreams." But a few days later, bowing to economic reality, Mr. Stern quietly launches a search for an appropriate buyer for his own firm, stating that it must be someone worthy of the traditional architecture and interiors he produces. He hints that Prince Charles would be ideal. Ralph Lauren, as adviser to the Prince, steps in and tries to buy the Stern firm himself.
Nov. 20: Mr. Stern, in desperation, goes to Michael Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company, in the hope that he will save him by outbidding Ralph Lauren and making the Stern firm part of Disney. But Mr. Eisner, who is Mr. Stern's biggest client, says he knows the difference between a studio and a drafting room, and he wants only the one, not the other.
Dec. 1: The real reason for Mr. Eisner's reluctance to buy the Stern firm leaks out: Disney is negotiating to buy the entire American Institute of Architects. "I've already got most of them at retail -- why not get the whole shebang at wholesale rates?" Mr. Eisner says. He announces that the A.I.A. will make the perfect substitute for the planned purchase by Disney of Henson Associates, makers of the Muppets, which fell through at the end of 1990.

HEADLINE: Landmarking's Doubled-Edged Sword

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
EVIDENCE is mounting that in many parts of New York City, landmark and historic-district designation is acting as a force for neglect rather than for the encouragement of improvement and preservation.
Some owners are willing to risk Buildings Department fines and let buildings sit with crumbling facades, sagging roofs, cracked and broken ornamentation, leaky windows or tired-looking storefronts -- which often belie improvements made inside -- rather than face the trouble and expense of winning approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for facade improvements and repairs. 
 Moreover, the economy's downward slide, which has made it harder to recover the costs of improvements through resale or higher rents, may further dampen owners' enthusiasm for work or changes that require the commission's approval.
The picture is not uniform. In the Longwood Historic District in the South Bronx, for example, designation is credited with contributing both to the survival and enhancement of architectural richness. In the 80's, with property values generally rising, owners of numerous landmarked and historic district properties showed a readiness to accept the added costs and difficulties of making landmark-quality improvements. These usually require approval by the 11-member Landmarks Preservation Commission.
Laurie Beckelman, chairwoman of the commission, acknowledged the long-standing problem of making the review system workable and efficient and challenged owners who have had complaints about it to apply for project approvals again. Many owners are unaware of procedural changes that have been made to improve matters, she said.
Nevertheless, numerous instances of neglect of landmarked properties have demonstrated that communities can hardly rely on landmark designation as a means to force owners to maintain their property. Some eyesores, like the building with a peeling facade at 166 East 73d Street in the Upper East Side Historic District, are jarring standouts on otherwise well-kept residential blocks or thriving commercial strips.
Some even stand neglected and all but abandoned even though they are occupied, like the house at 213 Cumberland Avenue in Brooklyn's Fort Greene Historic District. The owner of that property, with a two-story crack in its exterior wall, has piled up thousands of dollars in fines for Building Code violations.
In still other cases, owners of buildings in historic districts have forgone facade improvements as a strategic decision. These owners cite as the main deterrents the higher cost of facade improvements in historic districts, where the landmarks agency requires historically accurate design or replacement materials, as well as the landmarks approval process, which they say remains lengthy and cumbersome despite the recent procedural changes.
The 1965 landmarks law cannot compel owners of landmarked buildings or those in designated historic districts to undertake restoration projects. But once an owner makes even minor changes in a facade the law gives the agency a considerable say in what is done to a protected building.
A PERMIT known as a "certificate of appropriateness" is needed to make a visible alteration to a protected building. This includes projects such as storefront redesign or major facade reconstruction. Work such as masonry cleaning or door replacement can often be done with a "permit for minor work." Over the last few years the commission has expanded the types of restoration and repair projects that owners can submit for staff approval instead of a full commission review.
"I think landmarking is a wonderful idea," said Jimmy Silber, whose family owns a 17-story apartment building on Christopher Street and Greenwich Avenue in the Greenwich Village Historic District. "The entire community benefits from it. But being the owner in a historic district can be a curse. I would like there to be more than a token attempt at financial aid or at least some sort of specific tax deduction for the expense."
Mr. Silber has vowed to refrain from making any improvements that require commission approval. Two years ago the commission required him to replace ornamental balconies that he removed from the facade without authorization. All the costs associated with replacing the balconies came to $100,000, Mr. Silber said.
"When I took them off I thought I was complying with the law," said Mr. Silber, referring to Local Law 10, which requires owners of buildings erected before 1980 to inspect facades every five years for loose materials and to make repairs. "The engineering company inspecting the building said the heavy ornamental balconies at the 12th level were loose and posed a safety hazzard. But it turned out that I should have had the commission's approval."
Mr. Silber said he felt that instead of spending $100,000 to replace 12th-floor features that are barely visible from the street he could have spent the money on a restoration job with visual impact.
The building at 166 East 73d Street, a former chapel between Lexington and Third Avenues apparently now used for commercial storage, offers an example of the helplessness of historic-district designation to force facade improvements on unwilling owners.
The structure is violation-free, the Buildings Department says. Some neighbors see facade disrepair as evidence of owner neglect. But the situation appears to illustrate that even in high-land-value locations, if an owner chooses not to improve a property to extract from it a higher economic value, the landmarks law cannot force him to do so.
Even supporters of expanded landmarks designations acknowledge the problem posed by laws that dictate alteration or improvement standards and prohibit demolition of designated buildings but provide only token financial assistance. The Landmarks Commission has about $250,000 a year to distribute to owners for facade improvements.
The burden can be heaviest for owners of small properties in neighborhoods with modest property values, such as Greenpoint in Brooklyn or the Morrisania section of the Bronx.
"In some neighborhoods, gentrification has helped the owners justify the costs of restoration," said Norman Marcus, a lawyer who, as counsel to the city's Department of Planning from 1963 to 1985, helped draft the landmarks law.
"But there is not much you can offer as inducement in some low-density neighboroods where property values have not gone up that much, beyond pointing to the benefits that come to neighborhoods that have a sense of their places in history and a self-esteem that goes with that."
PRIDE had been the motivating force behind the preservation of the tiny enclave of turn-of-the-century homes in the South Bronx known as Longwood. A group of middle-income homeowners there has successfully restored and maintained their homes despite the decay that surrounds them.
In 1980, at their urging, the neighborhood bounded roughly by Prospect, Leggett and Longwood Avenues was designated a historic district. Of major concern now are the city-owned vacant and derelict homes in their midst. For several years they have tried without success to patch together enough money in city and Federal grants to rescue these buildings.
But owners of small commercial buildings in historic districts whose livelihood is tied to their property ownership maintain that restoration and preservation are luxuries they can not afford.
Murray Miller, a merchant and small-building owner whose property is in the Greenpoint Historic District in Brooklyn recently gave up a plan to put in new windows in his two-story building. Even with a grant from the city's Office of Business Development, which would have paid part of the expense, he said, the estimates for the cost of the wooden frames the commission wanted him to install was more than for the metal frames he planned to install.
"There was the time factor, too," said Mr. Miller, whose business is on a street where rents average about $25 a square foot and few tenants have more that 2,000 square feet. "I had an empty space on the second floor and wanted to get the work done before a new tenant came in. But after three months I had a tenant but didn't have approval for the windows. The tenant was more important."
ANOTHER property owner in the historic district in Greenpoint says he lost more than a chance to replace windows when it took the city more than two years to approve the zoning change and facade design and interior plan needed for him to turn a former embroidery and sewing factory in a landmarked district into a 30,000-square-foot commercial building.
"The approvals were just too late," said Henry Montag, who scrapped his plans to redevelop three adjoining red-brick buildings at 126-132 Greenpoint Avenue a few months after all the approvals were in place. "I am not going to blame the Landmarks Commission or the Buildings Department for the downturn in the market or the construction loan industry. But we did have tenants ready to sign leases when we started."
Mr. Montag says that while he waited for the appropriate permits, he watched prospective tenants drift away and construction financing dry up. Still empty, with all approvals for development in the owner's files, the buildings are now up for sale.
"We took the time to hire an architect with experience in projects in landmarked districts," said Mr. Montag. "We really wanted to do a nice job there. But whole experience had really turned me off on getting involved in projects that are in historic districts."
Ms. Beckelman, who took over as Landmarks Preservation Commission chairwoman eight months ago, said that some of the problems of delays were attributable to a lack of understanding of the process by owners and the fact that they fail to use resources available to them. "I challenge them to try again," she said.
Ms. Beckelman said that owners with even major projects who work with staff members from the beginning of the approval process usually can move through the system in two or three months. She pointed to procedural changes -- including the window guidelines -- made in the last few years to speed the process. Currently, more than two-thirds of theapplications for window replacement and repair projects are approved by the commission staff without a hearing by the full commission, which was required in the past. Petitions for approval of window work account for about 25 percent of submission to the commission.
Ms. Beckelman said the staff is working on similar guideline for doors and air-conditioners.
The new commissioner has staff members working on guidelines that would extend to other historic districts those that allow commercial owners on Madison Avenue to expedite storefront changes. On Madison, owners can have most street-level facade changes approved after a review by the staff without having to submit their designs to the commission.
Guidelines for retailers on Lower Fifth Avenue in the Ladies' Mile Historic District, for example, are now in the works.
"I want to give owners more certainty when it comes to landmark requirements," Ms. Beckelman said. "More guidelines are needed. And more approvals can be done at the staff level. The commission has 40 items to hear at the next meeting."
But Konrad Wos, a developer and consultant in Brooklyn who is involved in projects throughut the borough, including the Greenpoint section, said it will take more than new guidelines to motivate small commercial owners. He believes a revision of the landmarks requirements is necessary to interest them in the sorts of renovation projects the commission ususally requires.
"It is not right to have the same standards for places like Ladies' Mile on Fifth Avenue where owners have hundreds of thousands of square feet," said Mr. Wos, "and places like Greenpoint where the commercial properties are ususally no larger than a couple thousand feet. These owners don't have the capitalization that owners in Mahattan do.
"It is an issue of appropriate scale of response," he continued. "Without changes to make it easier and more cost-effective for small owners, there is little chance that they will participate."

Paying Off Liens
 
Question: I am considering buying foreclosed property through public auction. I have noticed that some properties have mechanic's liens attached to them. If, for example, there is a mechanic's lien of $15,000 against a property and I have a winning bid of $10,000, would I have to come up with $25,000 to make the purchase? . . . Timothy Keane, Staten Island
 
Answer: It would depend on the rules of the particular public auction.
In New York City, for example, buyers are not responsible for paying off most liens. According to a spokesman for the Division of Real Property, the agency that conducts auctions of properties taken for nonpayment of municipal taxes, the city would wipe out back taxes as well as liens, like the mechanic's lien.
The exception would be Federal liens that might be outstanding at the time of sale. The city would not have the authority to remove them.
 
M.C.I. Increase
 
Question: I have been notified that there will be an increase in my rent because of the installation of a new water tank. The increase has been calculated according to a 60-month schedule. When the 60-month period ends and the cost has been paid off, will I get an automatic reduction in my rent? . . . Elie Meinstein, Manhattan
 
Answer: No. Increases for major capital improvement are permanent and become part of the base rent.
"The 60 months that this tenant refers to," said Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, "does not refer to a timetable for how long the rent increase will last but is used as a way of calculating the rent increases for each tenant. There are limits on how high the rent increases can be."
For rent-stabilized apartments the owner many not collect in any one year an increase of more than 6 percent of the rent as listed on the schedule of rents filed with the owner's application. Permanent increases above the 6 percent can be spread out to future years.
Owners who make improvements before their M.C.I. increases are approved by the division may be entitled to additional temporary retroactive rent increases as well. "We do not penalize owners for the amount of time it takes us to process the application," said Mr. Viola.
There is also a 6 percent cap for the temporary retroactive portion of the rent increase. But once the amount of any retroactive portion of the increase has been collected, the temporary rent increase ends.
 
Window Gates
 
Question: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment with some windows that open onto fire escapes. Is the landlord obligated to install security gates on windows that open onto fire escapes? . . . Julie Christiansen, Brooklyn
 
Answer: No. Neither the rent stabilization code nor the rules that pertain to residential multiple dwellings in the city require owners to install security gates at windows facing fire escapes. However, the New York City Fire Department prohibits security gates if access to the windows they cover is restricted by fixtures or furnishing. Such gates would be illegal, for example, if used at a kitchen window above a sink or cabinets.
Another requirement is that the design of the security gates conform to city-approved standards. One requirement is that the lock on the gate is a type that can be opened without a key.

Down and Out in Darien: The Shopping

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
DARIEN'S reputation as a town teeming with beautiful and expensive homes matches that of Greenwich, Westport and New Canaan. But when it comes to shopping, Darien runs a poor third.
 "We don't want to be Westport or have a mall, but it's too bad when people have to leave town to make purchases in other communities," said Doug Milne, head of Kelly Milne, a realtor. 
 Worried about declining business, the Chamber of Commerce commissioned two studies in 1988 and '89 showing that customers were going elsewhere because of shabby-looking stores, poor parking facilities, and an inhospitable location -- a little over a half mile on Route 1 from Leroy to Sedgwick Avenue, interrupted by an antiquated railroad trestle.
 Crossing the Post Road with a baby carriage, customers reported, is high adventure, parking in the jam-packed lot behind the Manfield to West Avenue stores is terrifying and tilted, broken sidewalks do not square with Darien's image.
 When the findings were presented to the Board of Selectmen last summer a task force was appointed to see what could be done. "We hope to present a program to the Representative Town Meeting at its May budget session," said Warren Tuttle, head of the task force and president of the Chamber of Commerce. If approved, work could begin in July.
 The deteriorating Metro-North trestle cannot be moved, according to William Keish, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Transportation, but $1 million has been allocated to rehabilitate the structure by 1995. More control of Post Road traffic is possible through better defined crosswalks.
 The task force is concentrating on pragmatic improvements at four sites, and four civic-minded architects -- Neil Hauck, Robert Young, David Heuer and Howard Patterson -- are drawing up plans for West to Mansfield Avenues, Tokeneke Road, a supermarket and empty lot and a block opposite the vacant Darien Playhouse without charge.
 The first site to be improved will be the block between West and Mansfield Avenues where Mr. Tuttle is the proprietor of the Good Food Store and the Complete Kitchen. The task force has recommended repaving the sidewalks with concrete and brick; putting in benches, trees and lighting; rebuilding the rear parking lot and connecting it to an under-utilized bank parking lot; and giving several stores a front and rear facelift.
 The town's share -- sidewalks, parking lot, lighting and trees -- will cost up to $700,000. Property owners would refurbish at their own expense front and rear facades of their buildings, install new signs and provide benches.
 Sandy Falconer, owner of the building on the Mansfield Avenue corner, is willing. "I've been here 10 years and there is no question that Darien is losing business," she said. "The town has been very sluggish in responding to the problems." Two stores and some second-floor offices occupy her building. The third floor is unfinished and vacant, and must remain so under a 1962 zoning regulation that freezes existing usage of the buildings.
 Ray Nurme, the Town Planner, said that in return for conveying ownership of the parking area to the town for a town-built and town-managed lot, property owners would be allowed to increase the use of their buildings or put up new buildings. If the increased usage happens to generate more parking than the lot allows, "that will be another problem," said Mr. Nurme.
AN existing 134 parking spaces could only be increased to 146, but Mr. Nurme pointed out that dozens of spaces are now lost to Dumpsters and the cars of store employees and commuters. "Under municipal management, they would all be ticketed by the police," he said. Customers could park free for specified periods.
 Of the 369 downtown municipal parking spaces, 70 were built for employees across the street from the Post Road shops where the work, "but only six or seven cars are ever there," said Mr. Nurme. This could be because employe parking permits cost $170 a year, while parking behind the stores is free.
 George Zengo, a member of the task force and a Republican member of the Board of Selectmen, favors reducing the cost of the permits by half. Not entirely convinced of the merits of the whole project, he said, "It's a lot of money to spend on making a parking lot look spiffy."
 "There are a lot of people opposed to doing anything that will cost money," said Lawrence B. Morris, a task-force member. "Dyed-in-the-wool Republicans, yuppies with big mortgages and no jobs, local firemen who grew up here but can barely afford to stay, and the retired country club set."
 Mr. Tuttle is aware of the obstacles. "Besides getting the town behind this, there are 32 businesses and six building owners that must be in agreement," he said. Ms. Falconer and the actor Paul Newman are his landlords and pose no problem. Other agreeable owners include Michael Sherman, a Stamford laywer and William T. Lapcevic, a Greenwich lawyer who owns a building jointly with Whaja Chung, wife of the Stamford architect Do Chung.
 "This may not be a time when people want to spend money," said Mr. Lapcevic, "but if we wait, more people will just drive through here on their way to shop somewhere else." His building contains four stores renting at $30 a square foot and six two-bedroom apartments that rent for $1,000 each.
 "Five years ago when we bought the building apartment rents were around $500," said Mr. Lapcevic. Store rentals were around $10 a square foot. "We paid $1.2 million for the property and the old rents just didn't pay for the mortgage," he said.
 Another prickly downtown issue is the movie theater, vacant and in disrepair for more than four years. United Artists, the owner, has been at loggerheads with the Darien Planning and Zoning Commission and a group of residents over installing a proposed 200 or so additional seats, because of anticipated parking problems. "UA is losing interest," said the movie company's lawyer, Wilder Gleason. "Today the economics require 14-screen theaters for profitability."
 Jany Caroli, whose elegant antiques shop La Caleche is next door, is moving her shop to Greenwich. Triple-whammied by the disintegrating theater, by the troubled First Constitution Bank, which is selling her building, and by dwindling customers, she has concluded that "Darien is not good for business."

HEADLINE: Faded Movie Palaces Recall Gilded Past

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA

 BODY:
EVEN in these days of sterile suburban multiplexes, some moviegeors still prefer the old downtown theaters that were built with details like plaster gargoyles on the balconies and painted dragons on the ceilings.
"I love the old theaters -- the grandeur, the beauty, the experience," said Andrew Rosetti of Manchester. "They were the focal point of the community."
And Barry Goodkin of Trumbull noted, "The price of admission included views of art and sculpture." 
 Mr. Rosetti and Mr. Goodkin share their devotion with a thousand other members of the Theater Historical Society of America, based in Chicago. The organization encourages the preservation of old theaters, organizes tours of them, publishes a quarterly magazine called Marquee and maintains archives filled with photographs, clippings, programs, books, blueprints and more.
Several members of the society in Connecticut, including Mr. Rosetti and Mr. Goodkin, are particularly interested in 1920's movie palaces that provided mass entertainment in grand settings.
"Architecturally, these places are beautiful," said Mr. Goodkin. "But you can't operate buildings of that size just because they're beautiful. Many are gone, and some of those that remain are quite forlorn."
Mr. Goodkin has compiled a listing of more than 200 theaters built in Connecticut between the 1890's and the 1960's, many of which started their lives as vaudeville houses.
"I averaged 10 hours a week in libraries and historical societies for the best part of two years," he said. He listed every theater's size, dates of operation and architect. For some entries, he also noted the date and manufacturer of the theaters' organs.
Last spring, Mr. Goodkin and Mr. Rosetti organized a tour for the society of surviving theaters in Connecticut and nearby New York and Massachusetts. The itinerary included several old halls with new lives, including the Palace Theater in Danbury. A film and vaudeville house when it opened in 1928, it is now a movie multiplex, but it still has some of its "original grandeur," Mr. Goodkin said.
The tour also visited film and vaudeville theaters that have been restored as performing arts centers, including the Palace in Stamford, which opened in 1927 with the decor of a Spanish villa; the Warner in Torrington, whose gala 1931 opening was attended by Gov. Wilbur Cross; the Garde in New London, which opened in 1926, and the Palace in New Haven.
Built in 1926 as the Roger Sherman Theater, the New Haven structure was rededicated in 1984 as the Palace Performing Arts Center, after a major restoration. And Mr. Goodkin noted that while the balconies no longer have their original plaster gargoyles with electrically lighted eyes, the ceilings are still adorned with birds and fire-belching dragons. Tour members also visited the Palace in Waterbury. Opened in 1922 by Sylvester Z. Poli, who once owned 30 theaters, it is being restored by Domenic Temporale, a developer, as part of an arts center.
And they stopped to gaze regretfully at the deteriorating Palace and Majestic in Bridgeport, also built in the 1920's by Mr. Poli. The city has long been trying to foreclose on them, said Michael Nidoh, Bridgeport's planning director. He said the proceedings will begin early in 1991.
Many other theaters on Mr. Goodkin's list are gone -- demolished, destroyed by fire or converted to non-theatrical uses, from stores to storage. "The Palace in Norwich is now a parking lot," he said with a sigh.
Many society members have strong ties to the old theaters. Mr. Rosetti, manager of Cinema City in Hartford, once ran the Capitol in New London, another elegant 1920's theater now closed and in disrepair. Mr. Goodkin, a longtime General Electric employee, said his father managed theaters, his mother played the piano for silent films, he worked in his youth as a theater usher and manager, and he met his wife in a movie house.
Another society member who is a former usher, Edgar Kloten, is a theater critic and professor who lives in West Hartford. "I've always been interested in the gorgeous quality of those old theaters," he said.
Mr. Kloten was an usher at the Fox in Washington, D.C., and later wrote about that theater for Marquee magazine. He said he has collected a good deal of information for what may become a writing project on the old theaters of Hartford.
Charles Turner of Riverside, a retired film director, is a collector of theater memorabilia. His contributions to the society, have included files that he rescued some 30 years ago from a theater in Washington, D.C., that was about to be demolished. Mr. Turner had seen his first talking film at that theater, he said. The files contained a photo of a latticed arcade next to the theater -- the outdoor spot to which, in the days before air conditioning, the management moved projector, film and audience whenever the hall became too hot.
Another Marquee contributor is Jeanne Poli of West Haven, granddaughter of Sylvester Z. Poli.
"My grandfather was the biggest single theatrical magnate in history," she said. "He had his first theater, the Bijou, here in New Haven."
 
Three Theaters Remain
 She said that she spent a year and a half researching her grandfather's career, which began in the 1890's, for an article in Marquee.
"My grandfather was extremely artistic," she said, noting that he introduced design features like cantilevered balconies. Only three of his theaters in Connecticut are still standing, the Waterbury Palace and the unfortunate Majestic and Palace in Bridgeport.
"It's tragic," she said, adding that she does not approve of the modern theaters. "I wouldn't go to those cracker boxes we have now," she said.
Other Connecticut members of the Theater Historical Society acknowledged that moviegoing has changed, and that keeping the old theaters usually means coming up with ideas, skills and money.
"These are tough economic times," said Mr. Goodkin. But society members said they hope that people will continue to take an interest in old theaters.
Mr. Goodkin said he was pleased that a theater buff in his 20's came from California to join the spring tour. "We have to have young people involved," he said.

HEADLINE: Welfare System Is 'Muddled,' Says New Commissioner

BYLINE: By James Feron

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
WHEN County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke introduced Mary E. Glass as the new Commissioner of Social Services earlier this month, he spoke of her as "an innovator, a leader, a compassionate administrator and disarming." In fact, he added, "She disarmed a person who brought a shotgun into a district office and has taken a few knives from clients."
It was a light touch for a serious occasion. Ms. Glass, who has risen through the ranks of the Westchester welfare system from a $4,600-a-year junior social caseworker to the $79,605 post as Acting Commissioner, takes over a vast agency of 1,400 employees that consumes $2 of every $3 in county taxes paid by Westchester homeowners. 
 It is an agency, Ms. Glass conceded, "where the rules, regulations, notices, procedures and forms have become the end product of what we do, rather than the delivery of services."
"It's so cumbersome and muddled," she added, "that it's very, very hard to see the clients or have them take us seriously."
 
Coordinator of Workfare Program
 Ms. Glass replaces John J. Allen, who retired as Commissioner at the end of last year. She has worked since 1987 as a special assistant to Mr. O'Rourke in coordinating such new programs as Workfare, where eligible clients for welfare are required to accept work assignments or face removal from the rolls, and an assessment center for the homeless that has been weeding out roughly half the new applicants for shelter.
The appointment places the 49-year-old Buffalo native, whose father was a teacher and whose mother was Director of Child Welfare in Erie County, under competing pressures from social service workers, welfare recipients and some elected officials who had hoped Mr. O'Rourke would look beyond the county for a new commissioner.
In fact, the County Executive coupled the announcement of her appointment with news that he was also initiating a nationwide search, likely to cost $50,000, to determine if any other candidates had the "qualifications, experience, verve and drive of Mary Glass." He said he felt "pretty secure" that her job was safe.
 
System Termed Counterproductive
 The County Executive said he was responding to a request by the Board of Legislators, "whose members just want to be assured that I have taken a very wide look at possible candidates." He said he did not think the wider search was needed but had "acquiesced" to the Board in this case, reminding those who had gathered in his office for the announcement that he needed the Board's confirmation of the proposed commissioner "under any circumstances."
Mr. O'Rourke, a former welfare worker himself, said that "we have a social services system that was absolutely needed in the 1930's and the beginning of the 40's, a system that has not worked well since the 50's and has been counterproductive probably since the 70's and into the 80's."
He described it as a system that now imposes "tremendous burdens" on its workers. "I was once told that the average social service worker has a pile of documents that is two feet high and weighs 50 pounds and changes on a daily basis," he said. "And we expect these men and women to keep down the error rate."
Ms. Glass had her own horror stories. She said she had just heard that the Federal Government had "changed its mind on the monitoring of clients in jobs programs, asking that it be done weekly instead of monthly." A welfare official in Maryland, where the new schedule is under way, "said the directive could only have been devised by someone who doesn't know anything about what it is to implement on a local level," Ms. Glass said.
Even as she assumed her new position, welfare rolls were expanding. The recession, she said, was adding 1,061 new home relief cases a month in the category of healthy childess adults, compared with 751 in 1989. Home relief, one of the department's smaller programs, has a caseload of 6,650. It would be higher, she said, if 4,670 cases had not been removed through the Workfare program that began in early 1989.
The new Commissioner, who was lauded by Mr. O'Rourke as an innovator, has been working since last March on changes that she said would enable directors in the district offices to change places with directors in the central office, a switch that is dependent on Civil Service tests under current regulations and difficult to achieve.
 "The department is generally divided into two parts -- the district offices, where we have district directors, and the central office, where we have program directors," she said. "This division has solidified the department, with each division pointing to the other saying, 'If only you did your job we wouldn't be in this situation.' "
 
38 Job Titles Become Five
 She said she expected the situation to improve with the changes. "What I've been working on, with county personnel experts and the State Department of Civil Service, is to give them the same titles, say Managers One through Four, and in that capacity they can work either in the field or in central office." She said 38 job titles had been consolidated into four or five generic titles so far.
A senior county official said, "We'd reached a point where employees working in the field found that their career path blocked them from advancing to higher-paying positions in central office, and vice versa." The change, he said, "will allow people to move back and forth between program functions and line functions."
"Anybody from the lowliest caseworker to somebody who's bored doing program work and wants to go back out there and work directly with clients will be able to do it and won't be stuck, because of Civil Service, in positions they don't necessarily want," the county official said.
Ms. Glass has told colleagues that people in the central office who make program policy or interpreted it should have some idea of working conditions in the field and that there should be some movement in middle-management ranks between the central office and the field so that nobody loses touch with what is happening there.
 
'They Need a New System'
 These changes could improve the operation of a bureaucracy regarded by its clients, at least in some cases, as an administrative maze. One such welfare recipient, Myrtle Acklin of Yonkers, a former nurse's aide at the Ruth Taylor Institute, said last week that "they need a new system, one geared to getting people off welfare instead of turning borderline cases into hard-core cases."
She said she had lupus, which sometimes caused joint pain, and which forced her "to lose time" occasionally, leading to a loss of benefitsand prompting her to approach welfare officials for assistance. She said she had a 21-year-old daughter, who also had a daughter, aged 5, living with her at home.
"I wanted to continue to work," Ms. Acklin said, "although I never knew when I was going to be out. They said 'Why bother?' They also encouraged my daughter to be at home, but now she's a secretary who pays her own day care -- that's $75 a week -- and goes to college on weekends." Ms. Acklin is not working and receives benefits.
Paul J. Feiner, a county legislator from Greenburgh and a persistent critic of the County Department of Social Services, said the department "should figure out ways to work with other departments to find jobs for people who want to work but who are eaten up by the system and become permanent welfare cases."
 
Pride and Dignity a Factor
 Mr. Feiner operates an assistance program for the homeless out of his office in the County Office Building in White Plains. His program, the Have a Heart for the Homeless Committee, has helped 120 families since 1986, he said, and has distributed $36,000 in loans, with $8,000 of that amount "coming from families we helped."
"The county makes such a big thing out of Workfare, but people who need temporary help, who still have pride and dignity, get eaten up by the system and become full-time welfare cases," Mr. Feiner said, suggesting that the system was geared less to finding jobs for clients than to providing assistance.
"They are so messed up that they have a caseworker whose only job is to handle other social service workers who can't pay their rent or are marginal welfare cases themselves," he said. "Most of the people who come to us want to work, but the Department of Social Services doesn't know how to break the cycle of dependency."
 
Glass Defends Department
 "The primary function of my department is to issue benefits," Ms. Glass said. "Unfortunately, we have been charged with a number of responsibilities beyond our purview, from housing to jobs. That is why we have a contract with Westchester Community College to help us make judgments about other providers, so we can move people quickly from application to jobs or training.
"I think social workers are very good at what they do, but we're not the be-all and end-all of everything. We're not educators or builders of houses, so we look to others to be involved."
The department, Mr. Feiner said, "should figure out ways to work with other county departments to find jobs for clients."
"They could assign them to municipalities with financial problems," he suggested. "Or invite those municipalities to consider them for training for real jobs, anything to keep them from turning borderline welfare recipients into people totally dependent on the system."

HEADLINE: Technology;
Pursuing Zero Defects Under the Six Sygma Banner

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN; Glenn Rifkin writes frequently about technology. He is based in Sudbury, Mass.

 BODY:
When Motorola Inc.'s fiscal year ended in December, the payoff from improving the quality of the company's manufacturing operations suddenly became evident: $500 million saved during the year from reducing defects.
The Digital Equipment Corporation benefited from improving its quality as well. Its storage division cut its product-defect rates by 60 percent in one year, which meant a 25 percent reduction in overall product costs. 
 What these success stories have in common is that they were accomplished under the banner of "Six Sigma," a three-year-old defect-reduction strategy. Six Sigma was first used by Motorola and is now being embraced by a growing number of American companies seeking to improve quality.
"If you control your processes very tightly, you don't produce defects and therefore you don't have to refine and repair defects," said Richard Buetow, senior vice president and director of quality at Motorola. "You don't need the extra people and equipment."
Six Sigma is a statistical term attached to the concept of achieving approximately zero defects -- actually 3.4 -- per million opportunities. Sigma -- the 18th letter of the Greek alphabet -- refers to the number of standard deviations from the mean in any given statistically measurable process. The mean is the arithmetic average; the standard deviation is a measure of variation from that average.
Six Sigma requries no new manufacturing equipment, but it does require rethinking the manufacturing process. It is, therefore, very difficult to take an existing product line and bring it all the way up to Six Sigma. "You can't take an old product and move it to Six Sigma.," said Mr. Buetow. "You need to start with a clean sheet of paper."
According to John Early, vice president of research and development for the Juran Institute, a quality-consulting firm in Hilton, Conn., every process has a measure of variability to it, whether it is soldering a chip onto a silicon wafer or delivering a package. "A key thing in quality is to keep the variation as close to the mean target as you can," Mr. Early said.
If Six Sigma were used at home in the kitchen for baking bread -- which would never the case -- the process might work like this: First the recipe would be analyzed to see if there were ways to reduce the number of ingredients. Next, the measuring process would be assessed to see which were the more difficult tasks. Goals would be established for the number of acceptable measuring errors. Technologists would assess whether the rising time of the dough could be shortened and they would refit the over controls to make them more accurate. In the end, the bread would be sampled by the group that wrote the recipe to see if it conformed to expectations.
The quality of most manufacturing processes in the United States is plus or minus three sigma, which means that there are 66,810 defects per million opportunities for error. Motorola saw a clear potential to achieve better results.
"There's no great secret to all this," Mr. Buetow said. "You simply look at a process, center the mean and reduce the variation; do it the same way every time." In other words, with Six Sigma, the company sets a target for the number of permissible errors for each series of operations and holds to that goal.
SIX SIGMA was conceived at Motorola in early 1987. Motorola's chairman, Robert Galvin, tired of hearing customer complaints about quality, sent out a companywide directive. In it, he urged all employees to be relentless in improving quality.
"We could be doing from 5 percent to 20 percent more business and providing a steadier base of products and services, if we would but rise to the challenge and provide our customers the perfection that they expect," Mr. Galvin wrote.
Motorola's 5-year quality plan, which began with Mr. Galvin's 1987 memo, called for the company to achieve Six Sigma capability by 1992. That meant a tenfold reduction in defects by 1989 and a hundredfold reduction by 1991 from the 1987 rate.
Mr. Buetow says Motorola is well on its way to Six Sigma. "We will be close," he said. "The evolutionary process is already paying off. We realized a savings of $500 million in manufacturing costs this year. The target is to reach $1 billion in savings in 1992."
As a winner of the Malcolm Baldrige Award for Quality in 1988, Motorola was required by the Commerce Department, which awards the prize, to open its doors and let other American companies see how it has achieved its quality goals. Among the first visitors were the International Business Machines Corporation and Digital and others like Corning, Northern Telecom, Boeing, Caterpillar and Raytheon, that have subsequently initiated Six Sigma programs.
According to Stephen Schwartz, I.B.M.'s senior vice president of market driven quality, Six Sigma is now a critical part of a companywide initiative to improve quality. At the end of this year, I.B.M. expects to reduce defects by 10 times; by 1993, another ten times and by the end of 1994, the company says it should attain Six Sigma. "Six Sigma brings a common language to understanding defects and putting an action plan into place," Mr. Schwartz said.
I.B.M., is hoping that Six Sigma will help cut significantly into the $2.4 billion it paid in warranty costs in 1989. "People always gave lip service to quality," Mr. Schwartz said. "Ninety-nine percent good sounded terrific."
But in fact, according to an I.B.M. management report, a 99 percent defect-free rate translates nationally into 20,000 pieces of mail lost every hour; 5,000 incorrect surgical procedures every week, and, inside I.B.M., 10 defects out of every 1,000 solder joints on a computer motherboard.
I.B.M. is using its Rochester, Minn., plant to set the standard for quality across the entire company. In 1990, that plant won a Baldrige Award for its work on the AS/400 midrange computer. A specialist in the company's electronic card assembly group was able to show the Baldrige examiners weekly quality reports detailing a defect rate of 7 parts per million, almost Six Sigma.
Digital is requiring its senior managers to take Six Sigma training, according to Frank McCabe, vice president of corporate quality. Digital's Six Sigma plan is aimed at eliminating "non-value-added costs" like warranty repair service, which generally take 25 percent from each sales dollar at most companies.
"Our focus is to eliminate 50 percent of the defects per year in every part of the company until we get them all," Mr. McCabe said. Mr. McCabe predicts that the program can improve the entire company's financial picture by as much as 5 percent of net sales -- or about $650 million.
At I.B.M., Digital and Motorola, every process has been or is being reevaluated to eliminate defects. "We've even reduced defects in the way we do our financial reporting," Mr. Buetow explains. "By reducing cycle times, we've cut $44 million out of the cost of our final audit."

Chevy's Cab Picks Up Comment

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
Last week's column on the new Chevrolet taxi seems to have touched a chord. Here are excerpts from three of the letters:
 
Dear Sir,
The last thing that this crowded city needs is a taxicab that is longer and wider than the former Chevrolet Caprice. Those who "yearn for the way we were" should be yearning for smaller vehicles and fewer traffic jams.
It appears to me that Chevrolet completely missed an opportunity to design and manufacture an efficient and technologically advanced vehicle suitable for traveling city streets.
 
ROBERT J. EPSTEIN
New York
 
Dear Sir,
I do wish you had commented on whether there were seat belts in the new Caprice's back seat. Lacking such comment, I'll assume such belts are not there.
I commend your suggestion that the driver's seatback is not satisfactory, since this problem can surely contribute to, or even cause, long-term injury to the persons trying to make a living in this rough industry.
 
THURMAN B. WENZL
Lowell, Mass.
 
Dear Sir,
I wonder why your otherwise comprehensive article does not mention air-conditioning. All over the world, passenger comfort is foremost, so why not here?
 
EDWARD G. NEWMAN
White Plains, N.Y.
 Taking last things first, Chevy's new taxi package includes standard air-conditioning. It also puts seat belts in the rear. As for the car's type and size, I agree. Nothing comes close to the old Checker cab, but a short, tall van would be just the thing, particularly if it had a tough but pliant suspension and an economical and clean-burning engine. -- M. S.

HEADLINE: Peru's New President Unable to Halt Rising Rebel Violence

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Jan. 12

 BODY:
Dashing hopes for a drop in South America's highest rate of political violence, Peru's internal war has claimed 1,500 lives in the six months since Alberto Fujimori was inaugurated President.
Overall, 3,384 people -- civilians, soldiers, policemen and Marxist guerrillas -- were reported killed in 1990, according to figures issued this week by a commission on violence of Peru's Senate. The toll represents a 10 percent increase over 1989. 
 "I estimate that 25 to 40 percent of the national territory is now under the open or semi-clandestine control of the Shining Path," said Gustavo Gorriti, a Peruvian journalist. The Shining Path, a Maoist group, and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, a rival, Castroite group, are Peru's main guerrilla organizations.
"The change of government in Lima was completely irrelevant to the insurgent violence," said Mr. Gorriti, referring to the inauguration in July of Mr. Fujimori.
 
Campaign Vows Unrealized
 At the time, hopes were high for the start of a gradual pacification. An agronomist of Japanese descent, Mr. Fujimori received strong electoral support from Peru's rural Indian and mixed-race voters, a politically, racially and economically disenfranchised group that has provided the Shining Path with much of its support.
But Mr. Fujimori has been unable to translate into reality his campaign vows to fight guerrillas through rural development and a more professional army.
Instead, Peru's violence has not skipped a beat. In Lima, guerrillas have carried out dynamite attacks against the embassies of Germany, Japan, the Soviet Union and the United States. A car bomb damaged a luxury shopping center four days before Christmas. In mid-November, guerrillas shot to death a prominent judge four blocks from a tourist hotel where President Fujimori was attending a banquet.
 
Lima Without Power 66 Days
 Attacks on electric power pylons left this city of seven million people without power for 66 days last year.
In late November, a Shining Path guerrilla squad killed Javier Puiggros Planas, an agronomist who wrote a farm column in a leading Lima newspaper. In another rural incident in late November, Shining Path guerrillas killed a Japanese tourist, Wakamiya Makamori. A note left on the body said Mr. Makamori was killed "for being Japanese, like Fujimori."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Discounting a Short Mideast War

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Stock markets regularly surprise or confound. They did so again last week and produced interesting signals about the impact of a war -- or the avoidance of one -- in the Persian Gulf.
First, markets in Europe and the United States rose sharply Wednesday simply because the intensely watched meeting between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz went on for several hours. Market players chose to read hope for peace into the longer-than-expected discussion. 
 In Germany, for example, the DAX Index of 30 leading shares jumped 21.21 points, or 1.6 percent, and prices continued to rise in after-hours trading. In France the CAC-40 index of blue chips jumped 49.42 points, or 3.3 percent. The FT-SE Index in Britain climbed 29.0 points, or 1.4 percent. The Spanish, Swedish and Belgian markets also rallied. Only in a few bourses, including Austria and Norway, did prices barely move.
The fact that markets rallied so much on such shaky speculation points to the potential for a hefty bounce upward should war against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein be avoided. .
Then, of course, Mr. Baker and Mr. Aziz emerged separately to tell news conferences that their talks had failed. That should have precipitated a wave of heavy selling, so certain did the prospect of war seem to many at that moment. In the United States and Canada, where stock markets were still open, it did.
But the next day, less than 24 hours after the disappointment had sunk in, the rest of the world markets sprung another surprise. They hardly flinched.
In Europe, where markets had closed before the announcement of the failure of the Iraqi-American talks, there was no panic selling on Thursday. In Germany, the DAX even rose 8.24 points. In Tokyo, where the Nikkei 225 had fallen sharply early in the week, the index managed a modest 78.08 rise on Thursday. In France and Britain, where the markets did decline, the falls were large but did not wipe out the gains on the "hope" of Wednesday. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average also rallied 28.46 points or 1.2 percent. On Friday, Tokyo rose again while there were only slight declines in Frankfurt and London.
How should such behavior be explained?
Michael Howell, director or research in London for Salomon Brothers, said the market response showed that "investors have already generally discounted the effect of a short war."
But the response also seems to reflect a lingering optimism in the markets, a hope for the best outcome if there is a war. Many analysts have spoken for weeks with confidence about the chances that any war would be quick.
Good outcomes in war, however, are hard to come by. Barton M. Biggs, director of worldwide strategy at Morgan Stanley & Company, wrote recently that an iron rule of forecasting is that "Events always take much longer to develop than expected, but once they begin, they occur much faster and go much farther than anticipated."
If the lingering market optimism is a misreading of the situation, that could mean the potential for a slump in stock prices if a war starts is much greater than many people think. And if the war goes on for a time, the fall could be farther -- 10 percent, 20 percent, or more -- and even longer lasting.
Of course, no one really knows what a "quick" war is. Is it a week? A month? "Maybe everyone is miscalculating Saddam's ability to resisit, his ability to hold on to power," said Michael Diehl of Kleinwort Benson. "He might hold on longer than we think."
But even if the best outcome -- no war or a very short war -- is possible, it will not unburden the world's stock markets of their more fundamental troubles. Once the uncertainity over the Perisan Gulf disappears, uncertainty over the world economy, corporate earnings and banking's troubles will return to the fore.
Yuichi Kohashi, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America, said a rally in Japan, one of the stronger economies but one that is generally slowing down, would be limitied. The Nikkei 225, he said, would probably stop at 25,000, a jump of less than 8 percent from the 23,241.02 the Nikki 225 closed at on Friday.
"Even absent the war risk, we would not think the markets at these levels are particularly attractive," said Jeffrey M. Weingarten, director of international equity research for Goldman Sachs & Company in London.
"If there were a settlement in the Persian Gulf, we would expect a 15 percent to 20 percent bounce in markets overall," he said. "But that still leaves you to face the economic problems. We face the worst combination for equities worldwide -- slowing growth and rising interest rates. The markets are generally overvalued by 8 percent."
Mr. Howell of Salomon Brothers agreed. "Once the conflict is settled, what the markets have got to return to is is this economic background -- that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries are heading toward a recession. That fact is not in many prices, especially in the United States."

The Baseball Cap Is Breathing Life Into Headwear Sales

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Roy Langenberg says that people burst out laughing when he tells them he produces hats. "How do you make a living?" they ask. But Mr. Langenberg, the fourth generation in his family to head the Langenberg Hat Company of Washington, Mo., says that the headwear business is actually enjoying a comeback. No one in the industry expects formal felt hats to recapture the universal popularity they enjoyed before World War II. But most Americans own many more caps and leisure hats than they realize and seem eager to accumulate more.
The Headwear Institute of America, a New York-based group, estimates that sales have been growing at 5 percent to 10 percent for the past few years. More precise statistics are hard to come by because all the companies are small, most of them secretive and none publicly traded. Many manufacturers say that despite the recession, sales are still growing, driven by everything from changing fashions to the awareness that sunburn can contribute to skin cancer. Hat and cap makers hope that they will scarcely feel the recession because, for every customer who suddenly feels too poor to buy, others decide that they can economize by purchasing a hat instead of a complete outfit. 
 "Everyone was quite pleased with sales over the holidays," said Susan Tildesley, the Headwear Institute's executive director. She estimated that retail hat sales will top $2 billion this year, up from $750 million in the early 1980's, not including women's hats and odds and ends like construction hardhats. The more fashion-oriented $450 million women's hat business is growing 15 percent to 20 percent annually, according to Casey Bush, director of the Millinery Information Bureau in New York.
Like other apparel sectors, hat and cap makers have long been under pressure from imports. The huge cap market is dominated by the Chinese, who pay workers as little as 25 cents an hour with no fringe benefits or safety regulations, according to industry consultants. Taiwan and South Korea are also major exporters.
An anti-dumping suit against China in 1988 resulted in a finding that imports were being sold below cost but failed to prove that domestic manufacturers had been harmed. Imported caps typically cost 20 percent to 50 percent less wholesale than domestic products, according to Paramount Cap Manufacturing Company, a Bourbon, Mo., concern that, according to industry executives, is probably the largest producer.
 
The Industry Star
A Cap, a Logo, Voila! A Promo
 If the era when most men went to work in fedoras, homburgs or other formal hats is long gone, the day when every man, woman, and child wears a cap for recreation may well be approaching. Headwear makers estimate that cloth goods, primarily baseball-style caps, now account for as much as 80 percent of sales.
The biggest sellers boast logos of colleges and professional sports teams. Movies like "Batman" have touched off their own cap fads. Long a favorite advertising medium for farm equipment companies and seed producers -- the beloved "gimme" caps -- billed headwear is now widely used in corporate promotions and fast-food restaurant uniforms. An order for as many as 500,000 caps with a corporate logo is not uncommon, according to cap manufacturers. But imports account for about two-thirds of the business.
Domestic manufacturers rely mostly on design abilities, nimble marketing and quick response to customers to counter the lower costs of imports. None are big enough to fight back with extensive automation.
"Even the biggest just don't have enough employees cutting cloth to justify spending $500,000 on something like computerized cutting equipment," said C. Leon Sherman, president of CLS Associates Inc., an Aurora, Col., company that is the headwear industry's best-known consultant. Because the industry is too small to attract machine makers, it gets its new equipment by customizing devices made for other apparel makers.
Mr. Sherman said that the most successful domestic cap makers have lucrative businesses, routinely building up 10- to 12-week backlogs during the busy spring and summer seasons. "There are serious capacity shortfalls at times," he said. "This industry is far better off than the rest of the apparel business."
 
Fads and Niches
Boom-Bust Cycles With a Vengeance
Hats that attract the fashion spotlight can generate big sales, but manufacturers have learned that popularity can disappear with equal speed. In the most notorious modern case, the movie "Urban Cowboy" touched off a craze for cowboy hats. Overall hat sales nearly doubled from 1979 to 1981, Mr. Langenberg said. But instead of the gradual retreat the industry anticipated, demand fell abruptly. "Some people went out of business and a lot of others changed owners," Mr. Langenberg said.
Now, Western hats are once again selling briskly, but primarily in their native regions and in other nations. Many of the biggest names are owned by companies that market a wide variety of hats. Stetson is owned by AJD Corporation, an enterprise formed by Irving Joel, a Richmond, Va.-based entrepeneur who has acquired several hat companies.
Some companies try to smooth the business cycles by staying in niches. Kova Quality Hatters of Brooklyn concentrates on supplying traditional black brimmed hats to Orthodox and Hasidic Jews.
"The market is made up of about 100,000 people, who buy 50,000 hats a year," said Yaakov Ehrman, the owner of Kova Quality. "It goes up with the population."
Makers of military and uniform hats are also largely immune from style changes and foreign competition. But producers of uniform hats have been losing business as more police departments and other enforcement agencies switch to caps, according to Harold Selvin, president of the Keystone Uniform Cap Corporation in Philadelphia.
 
Hat Makers' Heroine
The Singular Impact Of Debbie Gibson
 If milliners were asked to vote for their favorite recording star, the clear winner would undoubtedly be Debbie Gibson. When Ms. Gibson, then a Long Island teen-ager, hit the pop charts with best-selling albums in 1988 and 1989, her distinctive hats sent fans flocking to the stores. Then young buyers turned to gaucho hats. Now, even with a recession looming, makers of women's hats are optimistic. "Business is very good," said Bernard Grossman, president of Betmar Hats Inc., which has made midpriced women's hats in Passaic, N.J., since 1933. Annual sales approached $15 million last year, which Mr. Grossman says places Betmar among the largest makers of women's hats in the country.
The new popularity of hats among younger women reinforces strong sales in high-fashion headgear. Ann Albrizio said that the designer hat business was "practically dead" when she began teaching a course at the Fashion Institute of Technology 14 years ago. Today, she has more than 200 students. Many of her former pupils are apparently prospering, designing hats that can cost hundreds of dollars or even, in the case of handmade designs from imported furs, several thousand. "I don't think the problem was ever lack of demand," said Ms. Albrizio. "It was lack of people knowing how to make hats because the children of people who got wealthy in millinery didn't go into the business."
Frank Olive of New York designs hats for every social purpose. "My customer goes out a lot, to luncheons, to meetings, to the races at Ascot," he said. For $500, he said, a hat might include imported silks and flowers, ribbons, or even jewels. The core clientele for midpriced hats has long been what Stephanie Caruso, a buyer for J. C. Penney in Dallas, calls "church ladies." But even among these conservative buyers, millinery fashions seldom last longer than a season. "We don't have basics," said Mr. Grossman. "Twice a year, you have to wipe the blackboard clean."
 
 
A SURVIVOR TOUGHS IT OUT
 When the first Worth & Worth store opened in Manhattan in 1924, hats were a high-growth business. Within two decades, the company had five shops.
Today, after several difficult decades that wiped out most of its local competitors, Worth & Worth operates a single small showroom on Madison Avenue, with 4,000 hats on view and an additional 10,000 in stock. But business is better than the reduced circumstances suggest. Harold Rosenholtz, who married into the family-owned business that he now runs, figures that his shop's annual sales of nearly $2 million probably make it the nation's top hat store. Sales in 1989 were strong and, until December's warm weather kept some customers away, 1990 was better still, he said. The company has benefited from its two-year-old campaign to sell its hats through retailers like Barney's and Neiman Marcus.
Mr. Rosenholtz said that hat retailers can improve sales 15 percent to 20 percent a year "if you make the right choices about stock." His shop displays fur hats, Panamas and famous names like Borsalino of Italy and Stetson. Increasingly, the hats are the company's own brands. Mr. Rosenholtz recently became part owner of a hat factory in Colombia, said to be the world's second oldest. He admires the workers' skills, noting that it takes 60 steps to convert animal fur or wool into a felt hat.
The price of hats in his shop range from $75 to $275, attracting a clientele that has included John Chancellor, Mike Tyson, David Hockney and Madonna.

Baker 3d had been meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz. The moment Mr. Tagler heard Mr. Baker say on television, "Regrettably . . . ," the trader was on the phone to the commodity pit. Buy orders had pushed the price to $31 -- the quickest rise he had ever seen. Economists are somewhat more stable in their sentiments, occasionally holding them for a whole week. Their consensus by the weekend was that if the United States fights and wins quickly and tidily, oil prices would fall and the economy would benefit. "I understand the mood swings, but people are exaggerating," said Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear Stearns. "There is a worldwide glut of oil against a backdrop of weak demand." But if there is a protracted war, many economists say, the budget deficit would widen, and oil prices and interest rates would rise. "The uncertainty will have a debilitating effect," said Richard B. Berner, a Salomon Brothers economist. "People will hold back from making long-term commitments." Even a last-minute settlement will not be enough to overcome recession, economists say, since growth was slowing before Iraqi troops set foot in Kuwait.
 
Again, Sweat Doesn't Pay
 
Will the returns on labor rebound and surpass the returns on wealth in the 1990's? From 1984 to 1988, the wealthiest gained in net worth, while everyone else stagnated, the Census Bureau reported last week. The less affluent depend mostly on their wages, which in the 1980's barely kept pace with inflation. Stocks and bonds, meanwhile, enjoyed strong returns. Lacy H. Hunt, chief United States economist for the Hongkong Bank Group, doubts that investments will continue soaring. But wages will rise as labor supplies tighten, he says. "The headlines of one decade go into the trash bin of the new decade," he said. For investors, "The decade hasn't started off very well, has it?"
 
Wholesale Comfort
 
The wholesale inflation news for December was comforting at every stop in the production chain. For finished goods, prices fell six-tenths of 1 percent overall; they only rose three-tenths of a point excluding food and energy. Prices for intermediate and crude goods, earlier in the production process, also fell. Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley said the report leaves the Federal Reserve plenty of room to stoke the economy. "The fundamentals are as constructive for inflation as they have been at any point in the onset of the last few recessions," he said. The annual gain, 5.6 percent, was the highest since 1981, but a mild 3.5 percent core rate.
 
An Uptown Jazz Market
 
Where sopranos now screech, saxaphones will squeal and coo. Lincoln Center has launched a jazz department with a $1 million annual budget. The marketing problem for Rob Gibson, the department's chief: How to create an uptown audience, week after week, for music usually heard in downtown clubs. His answers include children's concerts, master classes and small, informal theaters in the center. One possibility is a tribute to Sun Ra, the band leader whose fans can verify his claimed birth in outer space. But judging by what works best at Lincoln Center, Mr. Gibson might better raise his top ticket prices to $115, require black tie on opening nights and drag dozens of shield-bearing supernumeraries on stage.
 
Banking Forecast: Rain
 
At times last week, L. William Seidman's spirits improved to merely gloomy. Otherwise, he was downright dismal. On Wednesday, the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation warned the Senate Banking Committee that more major bank failures were likely if the recession persists past mid-year. On Friday, he landed in Boston, like a governor visiting a hurricane disaster zone, to say that the region needs more widely available bank credit to free itself from a recession. "I don't think there's probably a bad loan being made in New England at this time," he said. "Unfortunately, there aren't many others either."

A Payoff for Turkey?
 
One possible winner in the Middle East crisis: Turkey, which right after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait cut off Iraqi oil pipelines and made military bases available to counter Iraq. Turkey hopes the United States and its allies will offer more help in its continuing disputes with Greece. And Turkey can look forward to closer economic ties with Europe's wealthier nations, said Robert G. Neumann, director of Middle East programs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. Turkey needs aid to improve its infrastructure -- the phone lines are too feeble to carry faxes abroad, for example -- if it hopes to capitalize on its low labor costs. Although the European Community is considering several applications for admission, Mr. Neumann said, "Turkey may very well move up in the line." With luck, Turkey might prove that it can approach the prosperity of the West.

Oil Importers Prepare for War
 
The International Energy Agency, representing 21 oil-importing nations, agreed on Friday to release 2 million barrels a day from reserves in case of war in the Middle East. The United States, the largest oil importer, cut petroleum consumption 2.1 percent in 1990, the first drop in seven years. Domestic oil production fell to the lowest level since 1961.
