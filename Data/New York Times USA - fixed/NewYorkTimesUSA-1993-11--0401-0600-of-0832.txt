HARVEY SLUMFENBURGER'S CHRISTMAS PRESENT
Written and illustrated by John Burningham.
Unpaged. Cambridge, Mass.
Candlewick Press. $15.95. (Ages 5 to 8) 
 THERE are good tidings for parents fed up with the commercialization of Christmas in John Burningham's latest picture book, a hardscrabble but unsentimental tale of the tough work and valiant efforts that go into making the holiday pay off for the kids in these economically strained times. Just as Mr. Burningham's pooped, blue-collar Santa is sacking out after his annual gift-giving run, he notices that a single present for little Harvey Slumfenburger, a poor boy who lives in a hut at the top of the Roly Poly Mountain "far, far away," has gone undelivered. Dragging himself back out of bed, Santa earnestly schleps halfway around the world in order to deliver the precious parcel.
After young readers watch old Santa trudge over tundra, motorbike across ice, skate, ski and scale his way to young Harvey's bedside, they can't help being impressed. They'll realize that some of us work to make Christmas happen. "Harvey Slumfenburger's Christmas Present" is a book that encourages gratitude.
It also encourages careful and repeated readings. Mr. Burningham, whose books, from "Mr. Gumpy's Outing" to "Hey! Get Off Our Train," are enjoyed here and in Britain, has, in fact, tucked plenty of nifty gifts into his prose and illustrations, but they are not wrapped in flash and dazzle. His palette -- ranging from pale washes of pink to daunting black fields -- is richly sophisticated, and his subtly emotive figures are more like the cartoons in The New Yorker than the ones on Saturday morning television. Adults will get great pleasure out of teaching children how much there is to appreciate here.
You can elicit laughter by pointing out the bedpan discreetly provided for the sick reindeer tucked in their cozy beds (the fact that this Santa has only two deer -- and no elves -- suggests that hard times have reached the North Pole, too). You can summon up awe through the vast, Rothko-like sweeps of color signifying the tremendous distances Santa must travel to reach the Slumfenburger home. You can offer a lesson in politeness and modesty when, each time he meets a helpful stranger, Santa reaches out his white-gloved hand and says, "Excuse me, my name is Santa Claus."
"Harvey Slumfenburger's Christmas Present" is at once accessible and challenging, a book with a simple initial appeal that doesn't spoon-feed readers its deeper delights. The detailed texturing of Mr. Burningham's pen and watercolor illustrations, from the beautiful blue striations of sky that Santa traverses in a yellow biplane to the tiny town scratched into the paint at the foot of a mountain landscape, reveals more elements with each examination.
On the last page, curly-haired Harvey wakes up on Christmas morning to receive his one little gift, tagged with his name and wrapped in polka-dotted paper. The parting stroke is Mr. Burningham's refusal to reveal what's in the box. He leaves it to readers to conclude that the real gift, like the bulk of his tale, is in the giving. This is one sweet raisin of a book. Its wrinkle on the holidays is much needed.

A WOMAN UNAFRAID
The Achievements of Frances Perkins.
By Penny Colman.
Illustrated. 129 pp. New York:
Atheneum. $14.95. (Ages 10 to 14) 
 TWO finely rendered lives of Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962) and Frances Perkins (1880-1965), midwives of the modern social welfare state, appear not a moment too soon for young readers who are watching as Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donna Shalala present national health-care reform on Capitol Hill, the talk-show circuit and around the nation.
The role of women in the New Deal has long been slighted, but these two biographies draw on recent scholarly reassessments. Sixty years ago, Roosevelt, the first independent First Lady, and Perkins, the Secretary of Labor and the first woman ever appointed to a Presidential Cabinet, both testified before Congress. They both took part in political strategy sessions. They both traveled the country and were celebrated as gifted public speakers who could explain complicated policy issues in concrete, human terms. They both worked on legislation. In addition, Roosevelt wrote a daily newspaper column, and both she and Perkins published successful books.
Yet neither woman sought the spotlight or ever "cavorted" -- as Perkins liked to say -- before the press. And both cautiously allowed others of the Roosevelt brain trust to take credit for the genesis of historic programs in public employment, relief and Social Security for which they were in large measure responsible -- programs that fundamentally changed the way we define government in this country.
Happily, the charade is finally over, for them and, we hope, for their counterparts in the Clinton Administration. But these books remind young and old readers alike just how hard it has been for the voices of women to be heard in public life, let alone to be granted authority.
The poignant and by now well-known story of Eleanor Roosevelt's triumph over personal tragedy to become the most influential American woman of this century is recounted in "Eleanor Roosevelt: A Life of Discovery," by Russell Freedman, the author of many books for children, including "Lincoln: A Photobiography," which won the 1988 Newbery Medal, and "Franklin Delano Roosevelt." In measured tones he shows how her early work in the progressive settlement houses and voluntary associations of New York City inspired an abiding confidence in the potential of government to do good. We observe her practical political education as her husband's agent in the Democratic Party following his bout with polio in 1921. We learn of her achievements as First Lady on behalf of the country's most needy and underrepresented citizens -- especially black Americans. We follow her through World War II as she won the hearts of American soldiers, then into the postwar period after her husband's death in 1945, when, as a delegate to the United Nations, she became a force in her own right for international peace and human rights.
The personal drama of Eleanor Roosevelt's life also unfolds with unflinching clarity in the text and in the exquisite photographs that accompany it. We are introduced to the troubled and insecure child who emerged from the tragedy of her father's alcoholism and her parents' early deaths. We meet the young wife and mother of five who, with great discipline and determination, overcame the sorrow of her husband's infidelity and in subsequent years forged deep and abiding friendships with a small circle of men and women, each of whom, in a manner Mr. Freedman does not speculate about, fulfilled the need for intimacy her marriage no longer satisfied.
Penny Colman, who has written about Dorothea Dix and Fannie Lou Hamer, is equally thorough, fair and candid in her treatment of Frances Perkins. A native of Massachusetts, Perkins graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1902 and became a professional social worker in the New York charity world in which Eleanor Roosevelt volunteered. So dogged were her investigations of the garment industry, and so persistent her lobbying for wage and hour reform, that she was first recruited by Gov. Al Smith, and later by Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt, to work within New York State government, rather than against it. This prepared her to be President Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor, a job which then encompassed health and welfare as well as labor. Perkins's tenure witnessed the greatest period of organization in American labor history. She unequivocally supported the right to organize and bargain collectively, and used her considerable influence with the President to prevent him from restraining strikes by longshoremen and automobile workers. Yet she always had more confidence in the Federal Government than in organized labor as an instrument of social justice, and she devoted most of her efforts to protecting workers through maximum-hour and minimum-wage regulations.
Perkins differed from most of the women professionals of her era in one important respect. She did not sacrifice marriage in order to work. Sadly, her husband, Paul Wilson, an economist, spent much of his life in and out of hospitals, suffering from depression. This difficult dimension of her life is handled tactfully -- he remained in New York City for the 20 years she held Federal posts in Washington.
Both books tell us as well of the vilification that Eleanor Roosevelt and Frances Perkins endured from enemies of the Roosevelt Administration. As women, they were especially vulnerable to personal attack. In 1939 an impeachment resolution was brought against Perkins because she refused to deport the longshoreman and California labor leader Harry Bridges, who was alleged to be a Communist (the Bureau of Immigration was then part of the Labor Department). Though the resolution was dropped after hearings before the House Judiciary Committee, her reputation never fully recovered.
Young readers will learn in these biographies of the immense power that can be brought to bear against anyone in our society -- especially, perhaps, against women, who dare to demand that our politics advance a common good, that it be rooted in morality and not in self-interest. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donna Shalala, beware!

HEADLINE: PUERTO RICO VOTES TO RETAIN STATUS AS COMMONWEALTH

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Nov. 14

 BODY:
Rebuffing their Governor and his efforts to make this Caribbean island commonwealth the 51st state, Puerto Ricans voted narrowly today to continue their existing ambiguous relationship with the United States.
By choosing to maintain the commonwealth status that has been in place here for more than 40 years, Puerto Ricans made it clear that they prefer "the best of two worlds," in the words of a pro-commonwealth campaign slogan, to the prospect of more intimate ties with the United States. By an overwhelming margin, they also rejected independence, the third option that had been offered to them in the nonbinding vote today. 
 With all votes counted, the commonwealth option won 48 percent of the vote, compared with 46 percent for statehood. Independence accounted for about 4 percent of the vote, with a small number of ballots being deliberately cast blank or spoiled as a protest against the plebiscite.
 
Problems of Statehood
 "Commonwealth is the formula that is most convenient for Puerto Rico," said Angel Casanova, a 52-year-old woodworker, after voting this morning in Bayamon, a San Juan suburb. "Statehood would only result in more problems."
Gov. Pedro Rossello acknowledged the defeat in a speech at the headquarters of his New Progressive Party a few hours after the voting ended this afternoon. "The people have spoken, and I have to obey," he said. He added that by turning out in large numbers and peacefully exercising their right to vote, "in the eyes of the whole world the people of Puerto Rico have shown their class and their commitment to democracy."
 
A Majority for Neither
 Nevertheless, the result threatens to usher in a period of political uncertainty here and change Puerto Rico's relations with Washington. Thanks to the showing of the Puerto Rico Independence Party, neither of the two main parties here can claim to represent a majority of the island's 3.7 million people.
In addition, Mr. Rossello and Puerto Rico's non-voting delegate to Congress, Carlos Romero-Barcelo, will now be expected to ask Washington to enhance Puerto Rico's existing commonwealth status after having spent the last three months attacking the status quo as a "shameful" remnant of colonialism.
Tonight, leaders of the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party called on Mr. Rossello to begin discussions with them over how those enhancements should be pursued in Washington.
Since 1952, Puerto Rico has been a commonwealth of the United States, a unique arrangement that gives the residents of Puerto Rico some, but not all, of the rights and responsibilities of American citizenship. With commonwealth status, Puerto Ricans are subject to the military draft, but do not vote in Federal elections and do not pay Federal taxes so long as they live here.
An additional 2.6 million Puerto Ricans live on the American mainland and are treated like all other citizens. Mr. Rossello, who campaigned on a statehood platform when he won office a year ago, had made that one of his main arguments for statehood, saying it was time to end Puerto Rico's "second class" status.
The Popular Democratic Party, in contrast, offered a slightly modified version of commonwealth. They vowed to seek restoration of tax benefits that Congress reduced earlier this year to cut the Federal budget deficit. The party also said it would fight for an increase in Federal aid to the elderly, the disabled and the poor.
Throughout the campaign, backers of commonwealth status also argued that statehood would require Puerto Rico to relinquish both its use of the Spanish language and its cultural identity. They also said that statehood would bring with it a Federal income and increased Federal levies on gasoline, cigarettes and liquor.
Though three former Republican Presidents had urged voters here to choose statehood, President Clinton remained neutral during the campaign, saying only that he would respect the will of Puerto Rico's people. "Whatever they want, I want," Mr. Clinton told the Congressional Hispanic Caucus in September.
What voters apparently did not want was a substantial change, said Representative Jose Serrano, Democrat of the Bronx, who is one of three Puerto Ricans in Congress.
But Mr. Serrano, who did not take a public position on the issue, added: "I question how long we can keep this kind of relationship. Essentially, we have a colony in the Caribbean. We go around the world talking about democracy but we still have a colony. Eventually it's going to be a problem for us."
 
Sparing Congress
 Still, the result of the vote spares Congress the difficult and controversial decision that would have confronted it had Mr. Rossello's party been successful: whether to grant or reject statehood for Puerto Rico. Privately, many members of Congress say they are content with the current relationship and are reluctant to tinker with it.
At a news conference Saturday night and in his speech tonight, Mr. Rossello, a 49-year-old pediatric surgeon, gave no timetable for submitting the "enhanced commonwealth" program to Congress for approval. But he did give one indication of the political difficulties that may lie ahead for the island. He said that since the Popular Democratic Party, which controls neither the commonwealth government nor Puerto Rico's representative in Washington, had offered the winning option in the vote, "it is up to them to keep their word with the people of Puerto Rico."
The plebiscite on Puerto Rico's political status was the first since 1967, when commonwealth won 60 percent of 700,000 votes cast, compared with 39 percent for statehood. The Puerto Rico Independence Party had urged a boycott of that vote, and independence was favored by fewer than one percent of voters.
 
Heavy Turnout
 The last series of public opinion polls taken before the vote today had shown statehood and commonwealth in a virtual tie, with each supported by about 40 percent of voters surveyed. Leaders of both parties were predicting that victory would go to whichever side did the best job in bringing its supporters to the polls.
Turnout for the vote today was higher than in the 1967 plebiscite, when just under two-thirds of registered voters cast ballots. Members of the State Electoral Commission estimated that more than 73 percent of Puerto Rico's 2.2 million voters voted today, a sign of the passions aroused by the issue.
Despite rain that began at mid-morning and continued until the polls closed at 3 P.M. local time, the mood across the island was one of celebration. Cars bearing oversized American flags or the banners of the two main parties raced through the streets during the day and into the evening, their horns tooting and their passengers leaning out the windows to chant political slogans.
At polling places, 5,611 of which were set up at schools around the island, election judges good-naturedly kidded each other about their parties' chances; there were no immediate complaints of voting irregularities. Once the polls closed, supporters of the three options flocked to their respective party headquarters to hear the results come in, dancing, singing, and eating in the 85-degree heat as they waited for the tabulations to be posted.
At one polling place in Carolina, another San Juan suburb, an ambulance drove up around midday, and election officials carried an elderly voter to the booth so that he could vote. Radio stations carried reports of commonwealth party volunteers in many areas ferrying elderly or infirm sympathizers to the polls so they could vote for the status quo.
"I have no doubt the success we are enjoying now is the result of that effort by our members," said Celeste Benitez, director of the commonwealth campaign. She added that "statehooders received a tremendous setback, especially when you consider the economic resources they had at their disposal."
 
Lesser of Two Evils
 But the commonwealth total apparently was also swelled by the adherence of some voters who had declared themselves in favor of independence. Faced with the possibility of Puerto Rico entering the union, they opted for the lesser of what they viewed as two evils.
"In my heart, I've always been for independence," said Carlos Fuentes, a 29-year-old teacher in Carolina. "But the strong campaign effort and ad campaign of the statehooders left me in sort of a panic, and so I voted for commonwealth to make sure that statehood would not win."
At the same time, many voters who last November cast their ballots for Mr. Rossello and the New Progressive Party, giving them control of two-thirds of the island's municipalities, switched parties this time. They made it clear that though they were not critical of Mr. Rossello's performance, they simply could not commit themselves to the drastic change in Puerto Rico's political status that he was advocating.
"I always look for the best candidate, and I thought that was Rossello," said Jorge Valcarcel, a resident of Caguas, about 20 miles south of the capital. "But I believe in commonwealth, and that's what I voted for."
 
 
 
RETHINKING PUERTO RICO, POLITICALLY
 In Sunday's nonbinding plebiscite, Puerto Rico grappled again with whether to remain a commonwealth of the United States, to become the 51st state or to become an independent nation.
 
Political History
 
Puerto Rico became a United States territory in 1898, after the Spanish-American War. It was ruled by a presidentially appointed governor until 1947, when Congress voted to allow Puerto Ricans to elect their own governor.
 
Since 1900, the island has been represented in the United States Congress by a nonvoting, locally elected resident commissioner. The commissioner has a four-year term.
 
Puerto Ricans became United States citizens in 1917, but they cannot vote for President, are exempt from Federal taxes and get limited Federal aid.
 
Commonwealth
 
In 1952 the current Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was drafted by its elected Constituent Assembly, approved in referendum by 80 percent of voters and ratified by the United States Congress.
 
As a Commonwealth, Puerto Rico is part of the United States for purposes of international trade, foreign policy and war (including military service), but has its own laws, taxes and representative government.
 
In a plebiscite in 1967, 60.5 percent of voters were in favor of improved commonwealth status rather than statehood or independence.
 
Population
 
Puerto Rico is home to 3.7 million people, of whom 2.3 million are registered voters. The 2.6 million Puerto Ricans living on the United States mainland could not vote in Sunday's plebiscite.
 
Economy
 
The island's annual per capita income in 1989 was $6,200, the highest in Latin America but about half that of the United States mainland. Many manufacturing jobs, notably in pharmaceuticals, depend on Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, which shelters profits made in Puerto Rico from Federal taxes.

HEADLINE: Pacific Chiefs to Meet Where 2 Worlds Mix

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 14

 BODY:
A visitor to Seattle, the largest city in a mythical land called Cascadia, arrives at the airport and is whisked to a baggage area in a subway where the robot voice speaks Japanese, as well as Spanish and English.
About 140 miles north of here, Vancouver, British Columbia, is about to become the first large city in North America with an Asian majority. 
 When President Clinton and the leaders of the major countries of the Pacific Rim arrive here this week, they will find themselves in a land where two worlds an ocean apart are forming a hybrid society.
Cascadia, a realm that seems to be moving well beyond the imagination of the original dreamers, stretches from the rain forests of British Columbia to the pinot noir country of southern Oregon. It is a region united by geography, a distrust of the powers "back East" and a shared vision that the future lies across the Pacific.
In many ways the Asian part of the equation is already here, giving the edge of the continent a polyglot character that goes beyond its quirkiness and trademark gray skies.
"We are less Atlantic in our preoccupation than any other part of the nation," said Bob Kapp, executive director of the Seattle-based Washington Council on International Trade.
"Asians are just not exotic to most people who live here; they are not seen as a threat," said Mr. Kapp, who was instrumental in persuading the State Department to select Seattle as the American host of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
 
Ministers of 15 Nations
 Cabinet ministers of the forum's 15 member nations, including the United States and Canada and the powerful economies of the Pacific Rim, will gather here on Wednesday and meet on Thursday. Leaders of those nations, many of which have healthy trade relationships with the Pacific Northwest, will meet on Saturday on an island in Puget Sound off the coast.
In downtown Seattle, the concrete toadstool of the Kingdome is the home of the Mariners, the only major league baseball team that is owned in large part by a Japanese investor. Earlier this month, the voters in King County -- the 12th largest in the nation -- elected a Chinese-American, Gary Locke, as the County Executive.
And in Vancouver, an Asian immigrant from Hong Kong, David Lam, is now winding up his term as the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, Queen Elizabeth II's official representative in the province.
A backlash of sorts has developed in British Columbia against the heavy influx of Asians, who make up about 30 percent of Vancouver. And immigration was an issue in the recent Canadian election. In Seattle, Asians are the largest nonwhite ethnic group, accounting for about 13 percent.
 
Age of Pacific Predicted
 But even among those who believe that the flavor of the country has changed too dramatically, no one is fighting the dawn of the long-predicted Age of the Pacific.
The vision for Cascadia is a region that defies traditional borders and markets itself primarily to Asia as a place without clunky historical baggage. The cities are new, clean and green. You defy recycling at your own risk.
Except among the fringe elements, the architects of Cascadia are not talking about secession, but rather about a singular world view and a way of life.
The region has long had somewhat of a shared cultural tradition. The Northwest is a leading regional theater center, the opera company in Seattle is internationally known, and the region defined the "grunge" genre in popular music .
Some of the trappings, of course, are pie in the sky; there is now a contest to come up with an official flag of Cascadia, perhaps a cross between the Maple Leaf and the Stars and Stripes.
But the concept of a singular region with its prosperity and much of its new culture linked across an ocean to the region with the world's fastest-growing economy is reflected in subjects that will be under discussion at the economic meetings this week.
Washington State, which did $74 billion in two-way trade last year, is the most trade-dependent state in the country, with one in five jobs tied to overseas commerce. It is not just that the nation's largest exporter, Boeing, and it largest software manufacturer, Microsoft, have headquarters here, but that the Port of Seattle, the closest inthe mainland United States to Japan and China, does more than 85 percent of its business with Asian countries.
Similarly, British Columbia, Canada's fast-growing province, has received $10 billion in investments from Hong Kong alone in the last eight years. This has led some people to refer to Vancouver, pejoratively, as "Hongcouver."
But the money is welcome. And the cultural obstacles are seen as bumps on the way to a new society wedged against the Cascade mountains, from which it takes its name, and facing across the sea.
"For us, looking inward is not an option, and frankly, I don't think it's much of an option for much of the United States," said Michael Walker, director of the Fraser Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank in Vancouver. "By the end of the century, Vancouver, for all intents and purposes, will be an Asian city."
Such a shift of this continent's focus has long been predicted. "The Mediterranean era died with the discovery of America," President Theodore Roosevelt said nearly a century ago. "The Atlantic era has reached the height of its development. The Pacific era, destined to be the greatest, is just at dawn."
In the Pacific Northwest, the age of the Pacific had to overcome violent hostility toward Asians. Chinese immigrants arriving at the new city of Vancouver about a hundred years ago had to pay a head tax of $500 before they were allowed to get off the boat. In Seattle, a mob rousted Chinese laborers from their beds in the middle of the night, then led them to waiting boats. Only the edict of a Federal judge, standing in the rain in his pajamas, kept the boats from sailing.
 
A Market for Boeing
 The low point was the internment of Japanese-Americans, many of them second-generation residents of the Pacific Northwest, during World War II.
But the war pumped up Boeing, the world's largest airplane manufacturer, and the company became dependent on a global market. Now, Asia is the fast-growing market for Boeing airplanes. China, which is on a course to become the world's second biggest economy, behind only the United States, bought one of every six airplanes made by Boeing workers in Seattle last year.
"If you were to try some kind of protectionism now that affected trade with Asia, this part of the country would go crazy," said Richard Ellings, director of the National Bureau of Asian Research in Seattle.
Pinched by the recession in air travel, Boeing has laid off more than 20,000 workers in the last two years. But the tough economic times, said Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle, have not fostered a tendency to look inward.
"We see this as our time to solidify Seattle's place in the Pacific century," he said.
The Mayor is also the chairman of a commission that is advancing a trade alliance and joint marketing campaign aimed at Asia. The fact that government commissions are now acting on the concept of Cascadia has lent legitimacy to an informal idea that sprouted organically in discussions among academics and business people.
All is not sweet harmony between the two countries in Cascadia, though. Mr. Walker said temporary tariffs on Canadian lumber, instigated by Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, have had "the most singular negative impact of anything on British Columbia forestry."
And Americans have complained loudly about the city of Victoria's barely treated toilet effluence, which is flushed into the Juan de Fuca Strait separating Washington and the Canadian province.
In one respect, the Cascadia movement is a return to earlier boundaries. The old Oregon Territory used to encompass what is now British Columbia as well as the states of Washington and Oregon. It was called Columbia by the British. From the beginning, its economic livelihood was based on trade with Asia -- otter pelts taken by English seamen from the wet coast of the Northwest and sold to Chinese mandarins.
 
Cooperation Across Border
 In contrast with the acrimony along the United States border with Mexico, Washington State has signed two agreements with British Columbia in the last five years that promise cooperation in trade, investment and tourism. The border crossing at Blaine, Wash., is the busiest between the two countries, and it is situated beneath a giant white Peace Arch with the inscription, "Children of a Common Mother."
"Looking at Cascadia as if it were a country, the economy would be a genuine economic tiger of the Pacific Rim," said Bruce Chapman, a former United Nations official who is director of the Discovery Institute, a Seattle think tank. "People know what's driving it."
Respondents to a poll taken in this state last year agreed two to one that trade with Japan does more good than harm.
There are 44 professors who specialize in East Asian affairs alone at the University of Washington, in Seattle, where 16 percent of the student body is of Asian descent.
 
Summit Meeting on Island
 The highlight of the Asian conference here will be the summit meeting on Saturday inside an Indian longhouse on a tiny, uninhabited island, after a midweek meeting of diplomats at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center. The social centerpiece will be a reception at the Seattle Asian Art Museum, one of the city's first cultural landmarks, established more than 50 years ago as showcase for art from across the Pacific.
Noting that Vancouver was host to the mini-summit meeting between President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia earlier this year, the Cascadia proponents see this region as evolving into something they call a Geneva of the Pacific. Seattle is building an international conference center, with simultaneous translation features, to further that goal.
But there remains one subject of lingering insecurity in Cascadia about its new global role -- the weather. It rains less in Seattle and Vancouver than in any city on the American East coast, but a fine mist predominates. When the sun shines, there is a fear that traditional gray must soon follow, almost by punishment.
"The only thing I'm really nervous about is the weather," Mr. Chapman said. "We've had such a nice fall that it will probably be awful during the week of the conference. And then what will they think of us?"

HEADLINE: Newest Corporate Refugees: Self-Employed but Low-Paid

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
When Edward Gray lost his last job, as a patent agent defending filings before the Federal Patent Office, he gave up on corporate America. Converting a bedroom of his Los Angeles home into an office, Mr. Gray, 56, went to work for himself, recruiting inventors as his own clients.
He had tried to avoid self-employment. Most of his career had been spent as a physicist in the military industry, developing rockets and aircraft for General Electric, the Rand Corporation, TRW Inc. and the like. As those jobs disappeared, he took an 18-week course in patent law, passed a Federal exam and joined a law firm in 1991 as a patent agent. But 16 months later, the firm closed Mr. Gray's operation, and seeing no other choice, he became self-employed.
 
Harder Than Old Jobs
 For millions of people like Mr. Gray -- refugees from the corporate world -- self-employment, often as consultants, is turning out to be far harder work than their old jobs. Although many of them are well-educated, skilled and experienced, they have difficulty matching their old incomes when they go out on their own -- and their reduced buying power weakens the economy. 
 "I would certainly feel precarious if I had to depend on this income to live, but I have enough savings," Mr. Gray said. With degrees from Harvard and New York University, he once earned $75,000; his income this year will be less than $40,000. For every 100 potential clients with whom he talks, only one or two give him a job. "If I had the opportunity to rejoin the corporate world," Mr. Gray said, "I would probably like to jump right back into it."
More than 12 million Americans, or 10 percent of the work force, are self-employed. This huge group still includes entrepreneurs with six-figure incomes, in the Horatio Alger mode, as well as doctors, dentists, plumbers and others who have traditionally worked for themselves. But the largest contingent, more than four million people, is composed mostly of people like Mr. Gray, who are victims of layoffs, downsizing, budget cuts and a weak American economy that has tossed a huge number of white-collar workers out of jobs.
More often than not, this highly-skilled contingent of the self-employed is composed of older white men, with backgrounds as managers, professionals and administrators. Their ranks have swelled by 700,000 in the last decade, faster than any other contingent among the self-employed, the Labor Department and Census Bureau report.
The existence of this pool of often under-employed men and women suggests to some economists that the official unemployment rate, now at 6.8 percent, understates the number of skilled people, like Mr. Gray, who are ready to take jobs in the corporate world when the economy strengthens and jobs become much more available. As job openings come back, the competition from these extra workers could dampen American wages for months or years.
"The self-employed are part of the labor reserve and you really don't get into labor shortages until you use up some of this reserve," said Thomas L. Plewes, an associate commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. "It is not that they are not working; it is that they are a flexible labor asset, there to take care of bottlenecks and shortages."
 
Size Underestimated
 The Labor Department may even be underestimating the size of this flexible labor asset. The Internal Revenue Service puts the total at roughly 15 million people who draw nearly all their income from self-employment, without including farmers or the tens of thousands of self-employed in the underground economy who report nothing to the Government. By the I.R.S. count, the self-employed total nearly 13 percent of the work force, three percentage points higher than the Labor Department's figures.
Whatever the estimate, the self-employed have grown as a percentage of the total work force since the early 1970's, reversing a decline that had lasted through most of the century. The rise would probably be even greater if turnover were included in the Government's calculations; that is, the people who become self-employed in, say, February, and go out of business by November. Adding this constant turnover would swell the ranks of the self-employed by nearly 20 percent, said Theresa Devine, a labor economist at Pennsylvania State University.
 
Start-Ups Easier
 "One reason the United States has been able to have a lower unemployment rate than many European nations is that it is far easier in this country to start a business and become self-employed," said David Evans, vice president of National Economic Research Associates, who has published studies on self-employment.
But if starting a business is easy, making a substantial living from it is not.
"On their own, people lack capital and personnel, and they have a constant insecurity about the steadiness of their incomes." said Katherine Newman, a Columbia University anthropologist who has studied the self-employed. "Only people with fairly defined skills in demand, like tax specialists, seem able to make a big success of self-employment," she said.
 
In a Dead Spell
 Mr. Gray has had only 10 clients in 18 months of self-employment. Each paid $4,000 to $5,000 for him to prepare a patent application, a process that took more than 40 hours of concentrated work. He said he hoped there would be additional revenue from these inventors when the time came to defend the applications before the Patent Office. For the moment, however, he has reached a dead spell. "I have not worked on anything in several weeks," he said.
"I thought in September that the fourth quarter would be very productive, because I had all kinds of leads and possibilities, and without exception they have fizzled out," Mr. Gray said. Meanwhile, he is seeking additional clients through advertisements in specialty journals.
Priscilla Claman does not have dead time, but she faces other obstacles. As the president of Career Strategies Inc. in Boston, she provides training programs and counseling on work habits and efficiency at fees of $85 to $125 an hour. She started the firm with a partner four years ago, and has built up enough corporate clients to fill her days and those of three employees -- an unusually large staff for America's self-employed.
 
A Limit on Growth
 She also counsels people who lose or leave their jobs. Often, she tells departing executives to become temporarily self-employed in their chosen fields -- even if they do not have much work to do -- because that can look better on their resumes than an interim period in a lower-wage job as they search for another top position.
Despite her full days, Ms. Claman, 54, faces a limit on her growth. She recently bid on a contract to provide her services to a corporation with offices across the country. "They asked me to bid on it, and I helped to develop the product that they sought," Ms. Claman said, "But I did not win; they thought I was too small."
Ms. Claman came to self-employment from a different route than Mr. Gray. She gave up a job as senior vice president of human resources at the Bank of New England, about six months before a crisis developed there that ended in the bank's failure.
Why did she leave a job that paid $80,000 a year? She said the bank had changed in the eight years she was there, and had become more impersonal and less involved in the activities of the communities where it had branches. Career Strategies allowed her to continue in her specialty. Bank of New England was an early client and other clients came through referrals and a newsletter that Ms. Claman publishes quarterly.
 
Forming an Alliance
 Still, her take-home pay of $60,000 to $70,000 is less than she earned as a bank executive. To get above that level, Ms. Claman says, she would have to add employees -- maybe 10 more people to win the sort of big contract that she recently lost. Unwilling to do this, she is arranging an alliance with Career Development Services of Rochester, a bigger operation that would market for her and join in the bidding for big contracts.
"Someday I expect to make a lot of money from Career Strategies," she said. "If I did not think that, I would pull the plug and go back to work as an executive."
While Mr. Gray and Ms. Claman are still working in professional occupations, Nancy Lockwood, another corporate refugee, has struck out in a very different direction. After 17 years at the International Business Machines Corporation, moving into marketing in her final post, she took a buyout -- more than $45,000 -- and set herself up as an antiques dealer. She left I.B.M. reluctantly, she said, worried that while her job had not disappeared, it might.
 
A 4:30 A.M. Start
 "My job was relatively safe," she said, "but there was talk that there might not be another buyout offer, and I had been playing around with antiques and I thought maybe I could make it."
She specializes in printed cotton tablecloths from the 1940's and 50's, which she searches out at flea markets and resells. "I work harder than I ever did," she said. "I get up at 4:30 A.M. and get out on the road."
Still, her take-home income has shrunk to $1,500 a month, from more than $4,000. The reduced income covers her $1,000 in mortgage and maintenance payments for a cooperative apartment in Tarrytown, N.Y., but leaves only $500 for car costs, meals and other expenses. Meanwhile, she is spending her buyout money. When that is gone, she said, she might take another job if she is still not earning enough from antiques.
"I feel I could get one tomorrow, at least as a secretary," she said. "I could always work for a temporary-help agency."
With earnings of about $18,000 a year, Ms. Lockwood is close to the median income for self-employed Americans, which the Census Bureau estimated at $18,815 in 1992, down from $21,343 in 1989, after adjustment for inflation. The median income for job holders earning wages and salaries also fell during that period, but by much less.
"These numbers clearly bear out that self-employed people are more sensitive to the effects of a weak economy than are job holders," said Charles Nelson, an economist for the Census Bureau.

HEADLINE: Pacific Trade Bloc Is Divided Over Chile's Membership Bid

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
As the leaders of 15 Pacific nations prepare to meet this week in Seattle to debate trade and growth, another issue has split both the group and the Clinton Administration: does the Pacific Rim extend as far as Chile?
The argument is not about geography. It is about whether accepting Chile into the group, the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, or APEC, would give a lift to Latin America's most dynamic economy or whether it would just blur the focus of an organization that is trying to define the relationship between East Asia and the United States. 
 Proponents of membership for Chile say that its recent economic reforms, its 10.4 per cent growth rate in 1992 and its relatively open trade policies make it a model for Latin America. They say that membership in the group is a fitting reward for its policies.
"They've done so much for their economy," one Administration official said. "They deserve it."
 
Chilean Request Refused
 But a number of countries in the group -- most notably Australia -- as well as Winston Lord, the influential head of the East Asia and Pacific Affairs Bureau at the State Department, reportedly feel that the organization is primarily intended to facilitate trade between Asia and Oceania and North America. They see a risk that it would lose its focus if too many countries from the Western Hemisphere were admitted.
American officials told an envoy from President Patricio Aylwin of Chile recently that the Clinton Administration would not lobby the group's members in support of Chile's membership.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher told the envoy, Finance Minister Alejandro Foxley, that if a consensus emerged at the Seattle meeting in support of Chile's application, the United States would support it. But American officials said the Administration would not do anything to help build such a consensus, effectively ending Chile's hopes for membership.
"The position of the United States is that they are keeping their neutrality because they are the host country for APEC this year," said a Chilean Government official who insisted on anonymity. "They said they would only consider Chile if there is a consensus."
Though the Chilean request was refused, the Administration is divided over the issue. While members of the National Security Council staff and the East Asia and Pacific Affairs Bureau favor a neutral American stance on Chile's admission, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the United States Trade Representative, Mickey Kantor, feel the Administration ought to lobby actively in Chile's favor.
Mr. Bentsen contacted Mr. Christopher several times in recent months to plead on behalf of Chile's application, but to no avail.
APEC is a fledgling organization of 15 countries. Its members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.
Some economists believe the organization may grow into the world's biggest free trade area.
 
Entry of 2 Expected
 At the meeting of APEC foreign and finance ministers, which will begin Wednesday, the organization is expected to approve the membership applications of Mexico and Papua New Guinea. But some members feel that since the organization is only four years old it ought not to take in any more members after those two countries until it decides what direction it should take.
Other countries, like Peru and Russia, have expressed interest in joining, but unlike Chile they have not made a formal request.
Like the other countries in the organization, Chile would not obtain any material benefitis immediately from membership. President Aylwin and other Chilean leaders see membership as a validation of their economic policies and view the organization as a way of linking Chile's economy more directly with that of Asia.
"The important thing in all of this is that we end up with a membership that makes sense and is in keeping with the original motives that brought APEC together in the first place," said Donald Russell, Australia's Ambassador to the United States.
"If the only critiera is that you can see the Pacific from a tall tree in your country, that's not a good enough reason to be a member in APEC."

The Economy
Self-employment is a growing refuge for many from corporate life in these tough times of layoffs, restructurings and a weak economy. Although many of the self-employed are well-educated, skilled and experienced, they have difficulty matching their old incomes when they go out on their own -- and their reduced buying power weakens the economy. [Page A1.] 
 Investment patterns emerging in the last few weeks indicate that investors are nervous about the recent rise in interest rates and the lofty levels of the stock market. Many investors and money managers say they have taken money out of bond and stock funds, and homeowners are scrambling to lock in mortgage interest rates in case they rise. [D1.]
 
International
When President Clinton and the leaders of the major countries of the Pacific Rim arrive in Seattle later this week, they will find themselves in a land where two worlds from across an ocean are forming a hybrid society. [A1.] One of the issues the leaders will have to deal with is whether the Pacific Rim extends to Chile. [A8.]
North American Free Trade Agreement supporters and opponents stressed the political, economic and diplomatic stakes riding on the outcome of Wednesday's House vote. Vice President Al Gore maintained that "the consequences of a defeat for Nafta in the foreign policy arena would be really catastrophic." Two Democratic leaders who are opposing the trade agreement, Representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and David E. Bonior of Michigan, said approval of the accord would represent a crushing blow to American workers. [A14.] San Antonio has staked much of its future on the trade accord.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Balance Sheets Are Healthier

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
It has been slightly more than two years since Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, looked the huge amount of corporate, consumer and government debt in the eye and likened it to a "55-mile-an-hour headwind" buffeting the economy.
But changes in the last 24 months allowed the cautious Mr. Greenspan to state publicly this fall that the problem is about half as bad as it was. 
 Private analysts agree. From Uncle Sam to state and local governments, from corporate America to individuals, balance sheets look better than they have since the late 1980's. But the picture, while improved, is not yet pretty.
"A lot of work has been done, both in issuing new equity and refinancing existing debt, but I think we still have a ways to go," said Neal M. Soss, the chief economist of CS First Boston.
Still, given the magnitude of the problem, some analysts are amazed that so much has been accomplished so quickly.
 
 
'The Miracle Years'
 A couple of years ago, many analysts predicted that it would take the better part of the decade for the private sector to pare back to manageable levels the mountain of debt taken on in the 1980's. Some say that goal has been reached.
"I refer to the 1991-to-1993 period as the miracle years," said James Grant, the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, a monthly newsletter. "And the miracle years have produced a sea change in American credit. There has been an important cure, and I think people's perceptions of the corporate financial system and the banking system has lagged behind the reality."
These are some of the encouraging signs that Mr. Grant sees:
*For the first time since 1984, Moody's Investors Service has upgraded the debt ratings of more companies than it has downgraded. Through October, Moody's has upgraded 133 companies and downgraded 129.
*Thanks in large part to the Federal Reserve, which for the last two years has kept an easy hand on monetary policy, banks are making record amounts of money. Equally important, the number of financially troubled banks and other lending institutions, is dwindling rapidly.
*The prolonged run-up in stock prices during the last two years has prompted companies to raise more than $61 billion in equity capital, according to analysts at CS First Boston.
*Consumer debt, which in late 1988 peaked at 19 percent of personal income, fell sharply in 1991 and 1992 and has been hovering at about 16 percent for much of this year. For an economy that is 30 months into a recovery, analysts say it is highly unusual for consumer debt to remain so stable.
 All of these factors are raising eyebrows in some corners of the credit markets. After two years of seeing a seemingly unending string of poor to mediocre reports on the economy, the recent spate of healthy numbers has been unsettling. And while many economists continue to think that a strong fourth quarter will be followed by slower growth next year, some bond traders -- and Mr. Grant -- are not so sure. Better balance sheets are a reason why.
"I would not say this economy is really off to the races," said Gail Fosler, the chief economist at the Conference Board. "But 1994 will be the best year we have had since 1988."
Despite the optimism, there are reasons to suspect that after two years of reliquifying themselves, companies are about to finance expansion in the debt markets.
For one thing, the improvement in credit quality is spotty.
"The biggest areas of improvement have been with banks and with companies that were rated at less than investment grade," said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's. "Among investment-grade industrial companies, there are still more ratings downgrades than upgrades."
 At the Standard & Poor's Corporation, through the third quarter the number of companies downgraded this year exceeds those whose debt ratings have been raised, although the gap has narrowed.
Still, the improvement masks a dichotomy, said Edward Z. Emmer, executive managing director of S.& P.'s corporate ratings department.
"Even as the number of corporate upgrades has risen, the dollar volume of debt still seems to be weighted heavily to downgrades," he said. "A lot of smaller, speculative companies have had their ratings upgraded. But a lot of big companies, like I.B.M. for example, have been downgraded. And downgrading an I.B.M. impacts a lot of debt."
Further, even though corporate debt as a percentage of total capital has receded from its peak in 1989, when it reached a staggering 48.8 percent, according to Federal Reserve statistics, it remains very high.
Moody's estimates that through the first half of 1993 the debt-to-capital ratio had fallen to 45.8 percent.
 
 
Some Improvements Made
 "We have improved, but we are not down to the levels of debt protection that were in effect at the start of the previous recovery," in the early 1980's, Mr. Lonski said. "We have not yet gotten to the point we were at the outset of the 1980's leveraging phenomenon."
In 1982, as the economy emerged from the deep 1980-81 recession, the corporate debt-to-capital ratio stood at 33.9 percent.
It also remains to be seen if the stock market will be as receptive to new equity offerings as it has been during the last two years.
But given the amount of equity that was retired in the 1980's through stock buybacks, mergers and other corporate transactions, a friendly equity market, as well as faster economic growth, will probably be necessary to repair balance sheets further.
The $61 billion worth of equity capital that had been raised since early 1991 is a big number. But it pales against the $643.7 billion of equity that was retired from 1983 to the first quarter of 1991.
And it is unclear whether, after two years of tidying up, companies think they have done enough.
"There is an element of faddishness in determining what the correct level of debt to equity there should be," said Mr. Soss of CS First Boston. "In the 1980's, it was fashionable to have more debt. So far in the 1990's, it is to have more equity."

HEADLINE: LAND MINES CALLED A WORLD MENACE

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
Thousands of men, women and children in more than 60 countries are killed or maimed each month by land mines, a panel of experts has reported, and unless drastic international action is taken, the casualty rate promises to grow far worse.
According to a 510-page report published last week by the Arms Project, a branch of the research organization Human Rights Watch, some 100 million mines around the world threaten civilians. Moreover, far more mines are being planted each day than are deactivated in mine-clearing operations, so the casualty toll is steadily increasing. 
 In Cambodia alone, where reasonably comprehensive statistics are available, some 30,000 people have lost limbs, most of them because of mines, according to the report.
Although Italy, China and the former Soviet Union have been the major recent suppliers of land mines to a market that pays up to $200 million annually for the devices, some 100 companies and government agencies in 48 countries have been exporting 340 different types of antipersonnel mines.
 
Senator Seeks U.N. Action
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, a leader in the movement to curb or abolish the use of these mines, introduced an American resolution in the United Nations on Thursday that would bind nations to halting the export of these weapons.
He said in an interview that the measure appeared to have strong, but not unanimous, international backing. While most of Western Europe seems likely to endorse the resolution, several nations, including Britain, have withheld support. Britain is believed to be reluctant because of contractual obligations it may have to supply arms to countries in the Middle East.
The Senate has agreed to an initiative by Senator Leahy to include a $10 million appropriation in the current defense bill to advise and assist other nations in efforts to clear minefields. The Senate is also expected to approve a three-year extension of a moratorium, in effect for a year, that bans American export of land mines.
But specialists agree that no international agreement will halt the production and use of land mines altogether.
"What we hope to do is to portray antipersonnel mines as even worse than chemical or biological weapons," said Stephen D. Goose, director of the Washington office of the Arms Project. "Mines have certainly killed and maimed far more people than all the victims of chemical, biological and nuclear warfare put together."
 
Economic Impact Cited
 Senator Leahy, who said he discussed mines with President Clinton and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel at a lunch on Friday, said that in addition to the human tragedy created by mines, the economic impact on the third world is staggering.
"In countries like Cambodia, a single draft animal may be all a farm family has to work its field," he said. "If that animal is killed by a mine while plowing, the family loses everything.
"In Cambodia, they're clearing mines an arm or a leg at a time."
Senator Leahy and others have said the Defense Department has not wholeheartedly supported their efforts.
"The Defense Department argues that the United States manufactures mines that self-destruct, and that since such mines do not pose a long-term danger to civilians, they should not be banned," Senator Leahy said. "We disagree. We must set an example for the rest of the world, much of which is too poor to buy expensive self-destructive mines. Besides, even if only 10 percent of our mines fail to destroy themselves after a given period of time, 10 percent still represents a terrible danger."
 
Clearing Mines Is Difficult
 Clearing minefields becomes more difficult and expensive each year, specialists say. Armies in many poor countries do not bother to map minefields. Mines increasingly are made of wood, plastic and other materials that cannot be located using metal detectors.
Many mines are scattered by helicopters, planes or artillery projectiles, and some, like the Soviet-made PFM-1, look like toys. These weapons, called "butterfly mines," are made of plastic and have little wings that spin them gently to the ground. Many Afghan children have been killed or maimed by picking them up.
"In the Netherlands, people are still being killed by German mines from World War II," Senator Leahy said. "Think how much worse it is in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Angola, Bosnia and all the other countries that have been heavily mined."

HEADLINE: Signs of Investor Nervousness Grow

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
In the last several weeks, Curt Pippen, a semiretired oral surgeon in Glendale, Ariz., has taken three-quarters of his money out of stocks and put it into a less volatile fixed-income mutual fund, where his investments could earn a lot less but are safer.
"I think interest rates are going to be rising and I am not much of a Clinton fan," said Dr. Pippen, 51, adding that he expected stock prices to tumble soon. "In other words, I'm afraid." 
 Dr. Pippen is not the only one worried about losing money, judging from investment patterns emerging in recent few weeks and the batteries of calls some brokers say they have fielded from investors nervous about the recent rise in interest rates and the lofty levels of the stock market.
According to Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund operator in the country, the first six days of November saw the largest average daily net inflows into money market funds in three years. Money market funds pay less than 3 percent interest on average, but because the principal is protected they avoid the losses possible in bond and stock funds if the market turns.
"I think it is probably a sign that people are getting cautious," said Roger Servinson, a managing director in charge of retail sales and marketing at Fidelity.
And the movement of money into money market funds is just one indication of investor nervousness. Many investors and money managers say they have taken money out of bond and stock funds, and homeowners are scrambling to lock in interest rates on mortgages in case they rise.
"I think Wall Street is getting very skittish and nervous," said Susan Abuza, a small money manager based in Rye, N.Y., who invests her own money along with that of clients. "I truly believe that the market is going down 150 to 200 points in the next two months," she said, explaining that she has sold a lot of her stocks and built up her cash position.
In part what is driving fears is that the stock rally that began with America's success in the Persian Gulf war and propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to a new closing high of 3,697.64 points this month, has sputtered in recent days. The Dow closed at 3,684.51 on Friday.
The bond rally, which brought long-term yields to 5.78 percent last month, their lowest level in 25 years, has also reversed, causing yields to rise. The yield on the 30-year bond closed at 6.15 percent Friday.
While this year's stock rally has been interrupted before, investors seem to feel particularly vulnerable now, possibly because the rally is already setting new marks for longevity. And any number of events could shake its footing. A defeat of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the House of Representatives this week could send a shudder through the financial markets because of the possible inflationary consequences of rejecting open markets.
And if the stock market teeters, investors will not have the comfortable haven in fixed-income securities that they have had in the past. "Safe" investments like money market funds and Treasury bills are producing so little income that they are quite unattractive.
Despite the uncertainty, some analysts and investors have remained calm. In fact, the flight of some money to safer money market funds has not stopped the move of money into stocks. Some investors still think the market can move higher and others still cannot abide the low single-digit yields in money market funds.
According to AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual funds, the net weekly flows of money into stock mutual funds averaged $3.33 billion for the four weeks ending on Nov. 10. The one-week flow of $1.99 billion was down from the previous week, but that influx, of $5.62 billion, was the highest since the beginning of September.
Those strategists who claim to be optimistic say the expected jump in economic growth to 4 percent in the last quarter of this year -- one of the factors causing uncertainty in the bond and stock markets -- will be temporary. They are betting that inflation will remain low as growth returns to a pace next year of 2.5 to 3 percent.
Long-term interest rates, therefore, could decline in 1994 or, at the worst, hover around 6 percent.
But David Roche, the international strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company in London, is not comfortable betting on this outlook of low inflation and moderate growth. He sees the possibility of two alternatives that would not be good for stocks.
One is a spurt of economic growth above the 3 percent level, which would push interest rates higher and divert a lot of the funds now propping up stock prices. The second is a flat global economy next year, with talk shifting from a concern about the rise in prices to fears of declines.
"This has made me believe I won't be 30 percent richer again," he said, referring to the gain he made when he sold some of his stocks and raised his cash position to 6 percent. "In a six-month view, I can't see myself richer than I am today."
Signs of investor concern can be seen on several fronts. Mortgage lenders say people are rushing to lock in interest rates for fear the bottom has been reached. For instance, Marlene Brown, a food consultant, cookbook writer and recipe developer in Studio City, Calif., said she was looking at a fixed-rate mortgage of 6 7/8 to 7 percent on Halloween, only to see the rate leap to 7 1/2 percent by the following Tuesday.
Rick Crossano, an executive vice president at Countrywide Funding, a large mortgage lender based in Pasadena, Calif., said in the first week of November the average number of mortgage applications filed daily jumped to almost 2,600, up about 400 a day from the month earlier. "There was a lot of panic submitting of applications," he said.
But even on mortgages the signals are mixed. James Wiggins, a vice president in corporate communications at Merrill Lynch, is betting that if there is an increase in interest rates, it will be slight.
"My gut tells me that money in the pocket now is the way to go," said Mr. Wiggins, who is looking for a variable-rate mortgage for a new apartment in Manhattan. "You are taking the risk that interest rates will move up, but if interest rates do move higher they will only move about a percentage point."
Some money managers, like Mrs. Abuza, say clients who have taken higher risk in search of higher returns -- like those who have moved money from the bank to the stock market -- have needed a lot of reassurance in recent days.
 
Safer Ground
 Some investors have moved on to safer ground. The Dreyfus Corporation said it saw the first significant shift into money market funds in two months in the week that ended on Nov. 5. And AMG Data Services found that for the four weeks that ended on Nov. 10, the average weekly inflow into the 1,100 money market funds it follows was $2.61 billion, up from $1.96 billion the week before and the second-highest weekly average in 12 weeks. Money had been pouring out of these funds in September and the first two weeks of October.
At Fidelity, Mr. Servinson said most of the flow into its money market funds came at the expense of the firm's bond funds, where redemptions or sales of investors' holdings have been picking up, probably showing that some investors have decided that longer-term interest rates have hit bottom.
Other investors have taken refuge in international stock funds. Net inflows into these funds in the first six days of the month are at the highest pace of the year at Fidelity, which could signal that more investors want to protect themselves by diversifying into markets where many analysts still think there is a potential for growth or, at least, less potential for a major decline.
With no consensus on the outlook for interest rates and the stock market, some investors may be calm because they are prepared for what might be ahead.
Tom Delnoce, the president of West America Investment Group in Scottsdale, Ariz., who does some work for Dr. Pippen, said, "The people we deal with are not that worried." He sold most of his own stocks in the last several weeks, raising his cash position to 70 percent.
Taking a safer path can be painful. In a world of declining interest rates, traditionally conservative investors have lost the easy decision of buying Treasury securities that offer liveable, if not large, interest rates.
Just a year ago, a five-year Treasury note yielded 5.88 percent. On Friday that was down to 5.01 percent. Two years ago, the yield was 6.63 percent. An investor cannot get that high a yield today with a 30-year Treasury bond, which is at 6.15 percent, although the risk of loss on the longer-term investment is two and a half times that on a five-year note.
As a result, some investors have taken on substantial risk to increase their return potential. They have put money into hybrid or derivative securities -- or mutual funds that buy them -- that offer high returns if interest rates fall. But if rates begin to rise, such securities or funds yield much less and can quickly eat into the principal.
These derivatives are hard for professionals to understand, so regular investors are likely to be surprised by what happens to their money if interest rates do turn up permanently.
The case of Otis Sinnott, a 73-year-old retired export manager from Eastchester, N.Y., shows the bind that many investors feel they are in. Mr. Sinnott has been worrying about what to do with his money in the bank. "I need more income," he said. But he is scared he could lose some of his capital if he buys Treasury notes.
Yet, at the same time, he is loath to withdraw a much greater amount of money from a stock market he knows is at high levels. "If I take the money out, what do I do with it? Put it in the bank earning 1.5 percent?"

HEADLINE: Merchant Marine Sees Its Academy in Peril

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KINGS POINT, L.I., Nov. 13

 BODY:
The Merchant Marine Academy, whose graduates have played a role in every armed conflict involving United States forces since World War II, is now fighting for its own survival.
The battle began when the Clinton Administration, as part of its budget-cutting bill, proposed a sharp cut in financing for the academy. The move would force the school to close unless it breaks with tradition and bills its students $15,000 a year for tuition, academy officials say. 
 Although the threat eased somewhat on Tuesday when the House Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee voted unanimously to remove the academy proposal from the bill, the matter now faces scrutiny before the House Ways and Means Committee, which is looking for ways to trim the Federal budget deficit.
Students, many of whom say they chose Kings Point in part because of its free tuition, say they are worried about the academy's future and whether they will have to begin footing steep tuition bills.
 
Tuition Shock
 "I'm still recovering from the initial shock," said Trey Howerton, 18, of Tampa, Fla., a member of this year's freshman class of 270 students.
"Somehow I would try to come up with the money," said Mr. Howerton, who said he passed up other offers for full scholarships to attend the academy. "I love this school and would hate to leave, but I know there are many others who would be forced to go because of the financial hardship to their families."
While the final outcome of the battle remains in doubt, so far no one at the academy has heard a single voice in Congress endorse the Administration proposal.
This has encouraged the 960 students now enrolled at the academy. They first learned of the tuition threat on Sept. 7, when Vice President Al Gore put forward 800 recommendations from his National Performance Review, intended to cut the Federal budget by an estimated $108 billion, or 12 percent, by Oct. 1, 1999.
Among the cost-cutting measures was a 50 percent reduction in financing for the Kings Point academy, which would be phased in over five years and save the Federal Government an estimated $45 million.
The Gore commission has questioned the need for a federally financed academy that duplicates the offerings of schools in five coastal states: Maine, Texas, California, Massachusetts and New York. The State University of New York Maritime College, for example, is at Fort Schuyler in the Bronx, across Long Island Sound from Kings Point. The study also questioned the role of the Federal Government in supporting a school that trains professionals for private industry.
 
Academy Called Crucial
 The academy is now celebrating its 50th anniversary. It was founded on Sept. 30, 1943, by President Franklin D. Roosevelt with the mission of providing the American merchant marine, armed forces and transportation industry with professional officers.
Since then, 19,000 graduates have helped to guide merchant vessels flying under the American flag, working as navigators, engineers and ship captains. But the United States merchant marine industry, which had several thousand vessels in the 1950's, has dwindled to fewer than 400 ships amid increasing foreign competition. That decline has raised concern over the United States's dependence of foreign merchant fleets.
Representative Gary L. Ackerman, whose Congressional district includes Kings Point, a neck of land on the Nassau County border that juts out into the Sound, said that although he understood the Administration's desire to cut spending, he did not believe the academy should be a target.
"I believe it's crucial to our national defense to maintain the academy," he said. "What are we going to do in a time of crisis, hire a navy?"
School administrators said the cut in Federal financing would radically change the student body or even mean the closing of the academy. In the immediate future, they said, they feared that the proposal would discourage prospective students.
Mr. Ackerman said an early recommendation by the commission staff that the academy be phased out by 1998 was rejected by the Administration. The panel estimated that closing the academy would save the Government $27 million a year and create revenue through the sale of the 80-acre campus on the former estate of Walter Chrysler, the industrialist.
 
Cutting Budget in Half
 Instead, the report proposed that the academy's budget be cut in half "as an economy measure," leaving the school little choice but to make up the difference by charging tuition. Tuition, room and board at Kings Point have always been free, as they have at the four other service academies.
"So far, I can't think of any member of the House who has spoken in favor of the marine academy proposal," said Suzanne Waldron, spokeswoman for the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, which oversees both the Merchant Marine and Coast Guard Academies.
But she said the legislative process could take many twists and turns and that the measure "needs to be watched closely."
The school's operating budget now totals about $30 million a year, said Capt. Robert Safarik, a spokesman for the academy. He estimated that tuition, if necessary, would be around $15,000 a year.
Mr. Ackerman said he was among more than a dozen members of Congress from around the country who were jointly sponsoring legislation that would "prohibit the imposition of additional charges or fees for attendance" at any of the five academies.
Captain Safarik said that it cost $108,000 to train each student at the four-year school, including tuition, board, uniforms and books. Unlike the other military academies, the Merchant Marine Academy requires students to cover personal expenses, and does not give stipends.
 
Proud of Diversity
 Students come to the academy by way of congressional appointments. Each member of Congress can propose 10 students a year. Their qualifications are then judged by admissions officials at the academy. The students, 10 percent of whom are women, are typically 18 to 22 years old and represent many economic backgrounds.
"Any change in the tuition system would have an impact on this diversity, which is our best asset," said Eric Lindberg, 22, a senior. "I can't imagine the members of Congress turning against us."
In return for their education, the graduates of the academy must serve five years on a merchant vessel and eight years in the Naval Reserve.
During their four years at school, cadets spend one year at sea, working on merchant marine vessels while doing independent study projects, with the ship as their classroom.
Mr. Lindberg, who spent his year at sea sailing from port to port along the Pacific Rim, said, "Throughout history, every nation that's been strong economically has had a strong merchant marine."
"Giving the power to other countries to control your commerce is not a good idea," he said. "And once Congress sees this, and gives the academy a fair trial, I truly believe they'll come down on the side of a strong merchant marine."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Tightrope;
Presidency Takes on Shifting Politics Of U.S. Role in Curbing Violent Crime

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Early this month, President Clinton was chatting with an old friend, Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke of Baltimore, when Mr. Schmoke described his visit to the family of an 18-year-old man who had been killed on Halloween by a 13-year-old acting on a dare.
Around the same time, Mr. Clinton picked up his copy of The Washington Post and read about an 11-year-old girl in a crime-ridden neighborhood who was planning her own funeral, down to the prom dress she would be buried in. 
 As Mr. Clinton has gone about the business in recent weeks of scraping together enough votes to try to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement and assembling a working majority for his health care plan, these episodes and others have been weighing on his mind, aides said.
The topic has bubbled up in unexpected places, during strategy meetings in the Oval Office, in speeches about other topics, on talk shows and in dinners at the White House with scholars like William Julius Wilson, who wrote "The Truly Disadvantaged," a book about the decline of the black family.
 
'It's an Outer Class'
 Mr. Clinton has even coined a phrase to describe the plight of people who are caught in the cycle of joblessness, crime, violence and despair.
"It's not an underclass anymore," he said last weekend. "It's an outer class."
So with little warning and few notes, Mr. Clinton's growing concern about crime, violence and the dilemmas that face children growing up in urban areas came tumbling out into the laps of a church full of momentarily stunned ministers on Saturday.
They did not stay stunned for long. The ministers, many of whom had been saying the same thing for years in exhortations to their congregations, began to applaud. Then they began shouting back in support.
The politics of crime, once dominated by law-and-order politicians of both parties, have been shifting in recent months, as shown in election results, opinion polls and a new willingness in Congress to consider measures like gun control. Mr. Clinton's speech may reflect that. But by changing the terms in which crime is debated, Mr. Clinton may further change the political equation on the subject as well.
It is significant that Mr. Clinton was standing in the pulpit of a black church when he let loose his torrent of words on crime, violence and the responsibility of black leaders to confront the problems plaguing their communities. Mr. Clinton has often been moved to Scripture and sermonizing when he is speaking at a church, where he is often preaching to the previously converted.
The setting also underscored the tightrope Mr. Clinton must walk on both the policy and politics of this issue. The anti-crime measure now before the Senate, which he is supporting, contains many of the same tough-on-crime elements -- including measures to limit the right of death penalty inmates to sentencing appeals -- that offended liberal Democrats when the Bush Administration supported them. He has also been outspoken in recent months on the subject of gun control, long anathema to conservatives.
And when he makes the delicate link between race and crime as he did implicitly by choosing an audience of black ministers this weekend, he must also tread carefully to avoid slipping into stereotype.
 
Pulpit of the Presidency
 The President concedes that the most a national leader can do to address inherently local issues like violent crime and its relationship to poverty is to use the pulpit of the Presidency to spread a message of hope and responsibility. He has called it a "moral duty."
"I think the President has a pulpit -- Teddy Roosevelt's bully pulpit -- that I have to use and work hard on and try to live by to try to help rebuild the conditions of family and community and education and opportunity," Mr. Clinton said during a White House news conference last week.
Although most senior officials at the White House have been preoccupied with Mr. Clinton's latest high-wire legislative battle over the trade agreement, few were surprised when he dispensed with the issue early in his speech on Saturday and focused instead on crime and violence.
"Washington's kind of a trap," said Stanley Greenberg, the President's pollster. "In the context of Washington, it's hard to be a social critic. So this has been building up."
Mr. Clinton, the aides said, had been searching for a way to climb into his pulpit on this issue for some time. Since the Administration introduced its health care plan, Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, have made frequent references to the connection between skyrocketing health care costs and the expense of caring for the victims of urban violence.
The President has wrapped the issue into his call for greater national security, linking it with the need for economic revival and expansion. And he quoted the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and the comedian Bill Cosby on the subject, all the while stressing that most people in poor neighborhoods "never break the law, work for a living for modest wages, pay their taxes" and are "trying to do the right thing by their kids."
"We have to rebuild families and communities in this country," Mr. Clinton said during a recent news conference that was intended to promote the trade agreement. "We've got to take more responsibility for these little kids before they grow up and start shooting each other. We have to find ways to offer hope and reconnect people."
 
Personalizing the Issue
 Finding new ways to talk about crime could have benefits on other issues as well. Representative Charles E. Schumer, the Brooklyn Democrat who heads a House subcommittee on criminal justice, said, "Crime has been transformed from an issue that generally divides Democrats into one that unites them."
"It's a strong issue in the inner city," Mr. Schumer added. "It's a strong issue in Utah. And the solutions as to what to do about it are less ideological and more about resources and focus."
Mr. Clinton has seized on the universality of worries about crime, and he has personalized it as a way of signaling to Americans that he is as affected as they are by the headlines they see every day.
Mr. Clinton has also assigned a group of senior aides to devise a comprehensive list of suggestions about how the White House can speak to the issue. The group includes Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros; Peter B. Edelman, a Deputy Secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services; Carol Rasco and Bruce Reed of the White House Domestic Policy Council; Roy Neel, the deputy chief of staff, and Mark D. Gearan, the White House communications director.
But Mr. Clinton's advisers are quick to point out that the President is not planning to call for any huge new infusions of Federal spending to address the problems he sees. In his discussions on the subject, the President almost always doubles back to emphasize the need to depend on personal responsibility to resolve social ills.
"We're dealing with pervasive questions," said Mandy Grunwald, an adviser to the President. "You cannot look to the Federal Government alone for a solution. This is about everybody taking responsibility."

HEADLINE: Wage Proposal May Hurt Affordable Housing, Critics Say

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
A proposed amendment to a New York State labor law scheduled for a vote in the Assembly this week would deal a severe blow to the development of affordable housing throughout the state, housing advocates say.
The amendment seeks to broaden the definition of public works to include all private projects that benefit from public subsidies like grants, tax breaks or low-interest mortgages. The state's labor law already requires that workers on public projects be paid what is known as "prevailing wage," which usually amounts to the standard union wage. A similar bill has already passed in the Senate. 
 Critics of the proposal say housing production could drop by 35 percent or more.
"The changes would cripple New York City's affordable housing programs," said Joseph Rose, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a policy research and advocacy organization. "The Legislature would put unbearable cost and administrative burdens on a remarkably successful effort to address the critical housing shortage by leveraging private capital."
 
Two Key Subsidy Programs
 Virtually all privately built, low- and moderate-income housing is developed with some public subsidies. The state has been putting about $25 million each year into two key housing subsidy programs, the Affordable Home Ownership program and the Housing Trust Fund. Over the last four years New York City has invested about $2 billion in renovation and reconstruction of rental housing, mostly in partnership with private, nonprofit and for-profit development organizations. Developers are able to charge tenants less than the market rate because, in large part, because they pay wages below the union scale.
Housing advocates say these private-public partnerships have been responsible for the construction of tens of thousands of new and rehabilitated units over the last decade.
But union officials say the line between public and private projects has blurred over the years. Assemblyman Frank J. Barbaro, a Brooklyn Democrat who is one of the sponsors of the Assembly bill, said: "It is standard in public projects for contracts to go the lowest qualified bidder. But it is only prevailing-wage rules that keep the low bidder from paying unreasonably low wages."
 
Difference in Projects
 Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democratic Assemblyman, supports a clarification of labor law as it pertains to public projects, but not the existing version of the Assembly bill. "There is a difference between construction projects like schools, prisons and bridge and road repair work and privately built and privately owned affordable housing," he said.
Senator James J. Lack, the bill's Senate sponsor, a Republican from Suffolk County, has said he would agree to an exemption for affordable housing. Minority contractors maintain the bill would hurt them because it has been the community-based projects that have given them a toehold in the construction industry. They say they would loose their competitive edge if they had to pay union wages.
Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Housing Partnership, a nonprofit organization that has assisted in the development of some 9,000 homes sold to moderate-income buyers, says the trade unions are trying to force their way into a segment of the industry that, despite a languishing construction environment, remains active.
"For the past decade this level of residential construction work has been labeled cockroach work by the unionized trades," she said. "Now with high-rise development in recession, the union wants to take this work."
 
Not Aimed at Unions
 Edward J. Malloy, president of the New York State Building Trades Council, said the law was not designed to put more union workers on these jobs. "So many exceptions have been made to the prevailing-wage law," he said, "that it does not mean anything. We're not saying that all jobs have to use union workers, but that whoever works should be paid prevailing wages and benefits."
Typical of the privately built, publicly subsidized housing projects in New York City are those that take part in the city's Participating Loan Program. A building's owner gets about 70 percent of the construction financing for renovation from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. The current interest rate is 1 percent. The balance of the construction loan would comes from conventional financing. When the work is completed, the city places limits on the rents.
On such jobs, contractors now pay about $9 to $12 an hour for basic labor like demolition work, and up to $20 to $24 an hour for licensed skilled workers like plumbers and electricians. If union wages were required on these projects, developers say, the labor costs would more than double.
"Most development costs are fixed," said Sir James L. Robinson, an architect and developer who has used city subsidies to rebuild multifamily housing in neighborhoods like Harlem. "Whether you are talking a bout Park Avenue or elsewhere in the city, one of the mechanisms to control costs is to control the labor rate."
 
'Will Be Fewer Projects'
 Michael D. Lappin, president of the Community Preservation Corporation, a private, nonprofit lender for housing redevelopment in low-income neighborhoods, said, "Since public money is limited and tenants can't be expected to pay more, there will be fewer projects."
Proposals to amend the labor law never survived a vote in either house until July. In the closing hours of the legislative session the Senate gave its unanimous approval to a bill that mirrors the one now before the Assembly.

Non-union workers are building new homes for moderate-income buyers in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. (Nancy Siesel/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD;
Both Sides Emphasize High Stakes of Trade Vote

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Just three days before the decisive vote in Congress on the North American Free Trade Agreement, supporters and opponents today stressed the political, economic and diplomatic stakes riding on the outcome.
Vice President Al Gore maintained that "the consequences of a defeat for Nafta in the foreign policy arena would be really catastrophic." 
 Another proponent, Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, said, "To defeat Nafta endangers this Presidency."
But two Democratic leaders who oppose the trade agreement, Representatives Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and David E. Bonior of Michigan, said approval of the accord would represent a crushing blow to American workers.
 
Politically Important Vote
 "I believe this agreement will lower our wages for workers who have jobs in this country," Mr. Bonior said. He added that he expected 500,000 American jobs to move to Mexico under the accord because companies relished the lower pay and looser environmental regulations south of the border.
The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on Wednesday on legislation that would put the trade agreement into effect. Politically, it is the most important vote remaining this year for President Clinton and Congress.
The President probably has the most to lose.
"He will be seen to have prevailed on a very tough vote, and it will help his Presidency if he does win," said Representative Vic Fazio, a California Democrat who supports the pact. "It will hurt his Presidency if he does not win because people are going to evaluate his ability to organize a majority."
Mr. Fazio, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which raises money and otherwise supports Democratic candidates for Congress, was interviewed by telephone last week. On television interview shows today, both sides predicted victory.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," "I'm not going to predict how many, but we'll win."
On the same program, Mr. Bonior, the House Democratic whip, who has the responsibility for keeping track of how colleagues plan to vote, said the opponents had "about 222 votes going into this weekend."
There is one vacant seat in the 435-seat House. If all members vote, 218 votes will be needed to pass the measure.
 
Counts Unreliable
 Over a decade, the accord would abolish all tariffs and other trade barriers on 99 percent of the goods traded between the United States, Mexico and Canada, creating the largest free-trade zone in the world.
If the House, which votes first on tax and tariff issues, approves the legislation, the Senate is expected to follow quickly with its approval. If the House rejects the measure, the treaty will die, and there will be no need for a Senate vote.
The Associated Press reported today that its survey of all congressional offices found 204 Representatives opposed to the measure or leaning toward opposition, 176 in favor or leaning toward support and 54 with unannounced positions. A survey last week by The New York Times with the assistance of Washington Trade Daily, an independent newsletter, had similar findings.
But vote counts at this stage are unreliable. Many legislators clearly have made a commitment to vote for the agreement only if their votes become essential to the passage of the measure. Otherwise, they will vote against it.
The best bet is that Mr. Clinton will either prevail by a few votes , -- perhaps by only one or two, as was the case on the budget legislation last summer -- or lose by 30 or 40 votes after lawmakers are released from their commitment to support the White House.
Two previously undeclared Democrats came out in favor of the trade agreement today: Maria Cantwell of Washington and Karen Shepherd of Utah. Ms. Cantwell's announcement in her district in Seattle came just before Ross Perot led a rally there in opposition to the accord.
 
Calls to Lawmakers
 The outcome now seems to rest on the votes of about two dozen undecided representatives, divided about evenly between the two parties. The White House said Mr. Clinton spent much of today calling those lawmakers and asking for their votes.
Using a strategy that Presidents since Richard M. Nixon have employed, the White House arranged for the House vote to come just before Mr. Clinton leaves for an important international conference -- in this case, a meeting on economic matters next weekend in Seattle with the heads of the governments of 15 Asian nations. The meeting is under the auspices of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, known as APEC.
This strategy allows the White House to argue that defeating the free trade pact would weaken the President's hand in the eyes of foreign leaders. Mr. Gore made that case today on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," throwing out acronyms like a juggler tossing clubs.
"The President goes out to the APEC conference the day after the Nafta vote," Mr. Gore said. "The other countries in the world that are looking at this GATT negotiation are just waiting to see whether or not we have the courage of our convictions."
GATT stands for the the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the worldwide trade talks.
 
Side Agreements Assailed
 Mr. Bonior took issue with the view that approval of a trade pact with Canada and Mexico would strengthen Mr. Clinton's case in international negotiations.
He observed that to win votes, especially from the Florida congressional delegation, Mr. Clinton had approved special trade restrictions for imports of citrus fruits, vegetables, sugar and other commodities, just when the United States was trying to persuade European countries to stop protecting agricultural products.
And he complained that the Mexican Government had a weak record on human rights, while the United States was telling China and other nations that human rights should be a condition of open trade relations.
Debating Mr. Bradley head to head, Mr. Bonior (pronounced BON-yer) said: "This is supposed to be a free trade agreement? How are we going to deal with GATT when this is over with? What are we going to tell the French? We're just going to tell the French when this is over with, 'Well, you know, we just cut this deal on sugar. We cut it on wheat. We cut it on citrus.'
"How are we going to deal with the Chinese? When the President, the day after the vote, goes over and talks to the Asians, is he going to say, 'Well, we really didn't mean the democratization concerns we had with you and Singapore and other countries'?"
Unlike the debate last Tuesday night between Mr. Gore and Mr. Perot, which turned on personalities and one-liners, Mr. Bradley and Mr. Bonior stuck to substance and argued their cases in a tone of mutual respect.
Mr. Bradley called the vote "a historic moment" and continued: "This is not a vote that's going to come again next year or the year after. This is a one-time vote. I think you can parallel this to when Thomas Jefferson decided to buy Louisiana, when Seward and Johnson bought Alaska, when Harry Truman decided to reject isolationism and engage the world with greater trade and higher living standards around the world."

HEADLINE: Patents

BYLINE: By Teresa Riordan

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PROCTER & GAMBLE may have been overly earnest in lobbying for patent extensions on Olestra, its long-languishing no-calorie fat substitute.
On Wednesdaythe Senate passed an authorization bill for the Patent and Trademark Office. Tacked on were provisions that would extend until Dec. 31, 1997, two Olestra patents due to expire in January and one that will expire in July. 
 The trouble is that Procter & Gamble lobbied not only Congress but also the Administration. Its two-pronged approach could backfire, giving the patents extensions two years shorter than those in the Senate bill.
In lobbying the executive, P. & G. called on Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, a law firm whose partners include Vernon Jordan Jr., the former Clinton transition chief. Procter & Gamble said that this fall its chief executive, Edwin L. Artzt, met with Robert Rubin, the Presidential economic adviser and former Wall Street executive, and that its president, John E. Pepper, met with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, whose department oversees the patent office.
 
'There to Share Information'
 "They were there to share information on Olestra," said Wendy Jacques, a P. & G. spokeswoman .
Procter & Gamble acknowledged that Mr. Jordan had met with company officials before but said that he had played no role in setting up the Olestra meetings with the Administration.
"Mr. Jordan does not lobby," said Joel Jankowsky, an Akin, Gump partner and spokesman.
Procter & Gamble says it spent $200 million developing Olestra, a fat-like substance that passes through the body without being absorbed, but that the long approval process has rendered its patents virtually worthless.
A report by the General Accounting Office two years ago agreed that Olestra faced extraordinary regulatory difficulties but also said that some of the delay had been of P. & G.'s own making.
The first Olestra patent, granted in 1971, expired in 1988. The three current ones were granted more than 17 years ago. P. &G. tried from 1975 to 1985 to get Food and Drug Administration approval for Olestra as a drug, which would have let it advertise its health benefits. After tests showed that it did not substantially lower cholesterol levels, the company sought its approval as a food additive. It is currently focusing on its use in snack foods like potato chips and corn chips.
 
Few Extensions Enacted
 In the last decade Congress has enacted at most a half-dozen extensions on patents, which normally have a life span of 17 years.
The Clinton Administration said it would not endorse patent extensions specific to Olestra. Instead, patent extension legislation drafted by the patent office would apply generically to companies in positions similar to P.& G.'s. According to someone familiar with the generic legislation who requested anonymity, Mr. Rubin's office initiated and monitored its formulation.
Michael K. Kirk, assistant commissioner of patents for external affairs, would not say whether Mr. Rubin's office had participated in drafting the legislation. He acknowledged that "Procter & Gamble did come in and talk to us," but said that "we have a long-standing aversion to what we refer to as private relief bills."
Late last month Representative William J. Hughes, Democrat of New Jersey and chairman of the Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on intellectual property, held hearings on new "generic fix" legislation that incorporated the patent office's draft legislation.
 
10-Year Extensions Sought
 The generic legislation would potentially give the Olestra patents a two-year extension rather than the three and a half and four years provided in the Senate measure. Neither is anything near the 10 years that Procter & Gamble originally sought.
The Senate measure has yet to be acted on by Mr. Hughes's subcommittee.
Mr. Hughes said that while he was sympathetic to Procter & Gamble's plight he was not sure whether he would approve the Senate measure as it stood.
"We may substitute the generic fix" for the specific Olestra provisions, he said. "Whatever we do, we're planning to resolve this" before Nov. 22, when Congress is supposed to recess.
Theoretically, Mr. Hughes also could do nothing, rolling the legislation into next year's session, which will not begin until late January. Such a turn of events could be disastrous for Procter & Gamble. If its patents expire before any extension legislation is enacted, relief will be highly unlikely, since Congress virtually never resurrects expired patents.
 
A Data Base For Living Wills
 Victor Alan Perry, an insurance defense lawyer in Reno, said he began thinking about a "system for administering a central depository for living wills" after reading in a newspaper article that more than $10 billion a year was spent for artificial life support of people who did not wish to be kept alive.
"That's an incredible amount of money, and it's probably a lot more when you consider that a lot more probably haven't committed their wishes to writing," he said.
Mr. Perry said that living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care often could not be found at the appropriate time or had not been properly notarized. Initially he envisions that the system would be accessible to doctors and hospitals through an "800" number. The service would immediately fax a copy of the appropriate document for a given patient, Mr. Perry said.
Ultimately, the system would take the form of an on-line service accessible by computer modem, he said..
Mr. Perry said he had written Hilary Rodham Clinton about the idea but had received no response.
Mr. Perry, Paul F. Oelsner, and Grant P. Anderson were granted patent 5,241,466.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Foreign Horizons Lure U.S. Broadcast Networks

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 14

 BODY:
Before it was acquired by NBC in early October, Super Channel, a pan-European broadcaster, struck Patrick Cox as a bewildering mishmash of paid religious programming, rock videos, news and home shopping.
But Mr. Cox, the managing director of NBC's operations in Europe, also saw a great opportunity. So, along with NBC programming executives from the United States, he tossed much of the junk from the broadcaster's schedule. He began improving the more promising of the existing shows, especially those that focused on European culture, business and news. He is stirring in liberal quantities of NBC programming from the United States, including "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno," the "NBC Nightly News" and the "Today" show. 
 The result, NBC executives hope, is a broadcaster with a strong appeal to affluent, well-educated and internationally minded viewers across Western Europe, where Super Channel is seen in 30 million homes and most hotels via cable and satellite.
With the political changes, new technology and deregulation creating broadcasting opportunities all over the world, international markets have long drawn the interest of program producers from the United States, as well as cable networks like CNN.
 
 
Increased Attention
 But now, as NBC's deal for Super Channel suggests, foreign markets are also drawing increasing attention from the three big broadcast networks. CBS has largely limited its participation to stepping up sales of its news programming abroad. But NBC has started a 24-hour news service for Latin America, is discussing a 24-hour business news service in Asia and is looking for other deals in Europe and around the world.
Capital Cities/ABC Inc., the parent of ABC, owns stakes in broadcasters and program producers in Europe and in sports networks in Europe and Asia. Last month it created a new corporate division, the ABC Cable and International Broadcast Group, in recognition of the growing prospects for expansion abroad.
"We recognize that international development and investment will be a primary area of growth for the company as we capitalize on our current solid positioning in Europe, Latin America and the Pacific rim," Daniel B. Burke, the chief executive of the company, said in announcing the creation of the new division.
Broadcasting executives said Asia was perhaps the most promising market in the long run, given its huge population and rapid economic development. But for now, most of their investments are in Europe, where the dismantling of the traditional state broadcasting monopolies and rapid growth of cable and satellite television have set off a chase among domestic and foreign broadcasters for financing, programming, advertisers and viewers.
"The media markets of Europe are at the same points of development as the U.S. a decade ago," said Thomas S. Rogers, executive vice president of new business development at NBC. "There's all kinds of growth potential going forward that we can be major participants in."
Profits are not likely to come easily, or quickly. Television viewers across Europe, most of whom were accustomed to watching only two or three channels, have over the last several years been confronted with a rapid proliferation of choices.
National broadcasters, both state-owned and private, are beefing up program quality and becoming more responsive to popular tastes. Cable and satellite operators such as BSkyB, partly owned by Rupert Murdoch, have blanketed Europe with news, movies, sports and general entertainment channels. CNN, while struggling to attract advertising, has invested heavily in an international version of its news service.
To the extent they rely on their own news and entertainment programs for their operations in Europe, the networks also face a cultural and political backlash. Led by France, a number of countries are stepping up their complaints about "cultural imperialism" and seeking to restrict imported programming, especially from the United States.
France and Belgium, for example, earlier this fall barred the Turner Broadcasting System's TNT and Cartoon Network from cable networks in their countries, saying the network violated the European Community rules that require broadcasters to carry a majority of European-produced programming "where practical."
 
Indigenous Investments
 ABC has sought to sidestep some of the political issues by taking stakes in existing European television companies. It has bought a third of Hamster, a French program maker; a 25 percent stake in Tesauro, a Spanish producer; half of Molinare, a group of production companies based in London, and half of Tele-Munchen, a producer based in Munich.
Through Tele-Munchen, ABC owns a stake in RTL-2, a German broadcaster. And through its ESPN subsidiary, it owns a third of Eurosport, the largest sports network in Europe. It also recently took a small stake in a cable system operator in Britain.
"We think we will grow as the industry grows, first in Europe and then in South America and then in Asia," said Herbert A. Granath, the president of the new international division of Capital Cities/ABC.
 
A Hybrid Network
 With Super Channel, NBC has adopted a different strategy. By taking a majority stake in the broadcaster -- the remainder is owned by Credit Lyonnais, the French bank -- and assuming full management control, the company is the first to attempt a full-scale European-American hybrid network. NBC did not disclose the purchase price for its stake, but industry executives in Europe said the network was believed to have paid about $25 million.
NBC said the deal was attractive because there were no other opportunities to acquire a pan-European broadcaster with the kind of distribution enjoyed by Super Channel. Mr. Rogers said Super Channel was losing money, but it could be turned around in two or three years.
NBC's strategy is to mix European and American programming, with an emphasis on news, news magazines and programming with an appeal to sophisticated Europeans, primarily business executives. Super Channel, which will likely be renamed before NBC introduces its new program lineup in December, is broadcast simultaneously in English, German and Dutch, depending on where it is being shown. The NBC programming that is added will be dubbed or subtitled.
The challenge for NBC, industry executives here said, will be to provide viewers with programming they are interested in that is not available from their domestic broadcasters, and do so without having so much of an American flavor that European viewers are turned off.
"Getting the mix right is a question of good broadcasting, which we are pretty skillful at," said Mr. Cox, a Briton who grew up in France. "We'll spend a lot on research to make sure we are listening to the audience."

GRAPHIC: Photos: "Getting the mix right is a question of good broadcasting, which we are pretty skillful at," said Patrick Cox, the managing director of NBC's operations in Europe. He took Europe's Super Channel, tossed out the junk, improved existing shows and mixed in liberal quantities of NBC's American programming. (pg.

HEADLINE: Trade Center Mysteries Deepen;
Trial Raises Tantalizing Issues but Leaves Them Unresolved

BYLINE: By RICHARD BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The mysteries have begun to pile up: two shadowy figures who returned to Iraq after the World Trade Center was bombed; a Domino's pizza worker traveling long distance on first-class airline tickets; altered passports; fake I.D. papers; bomb-making manuals.
All are elements in the World Trade Center bombing trial, which finished its sixth week of testimony last week. But while the mysterious Iraqis and the forged passports have been mentioned in the Government's case against the four defendants, there has been very little clear explanation of their meaning, or how they tie together. 
 Bound by rules of evidence, limited to the specific criminal activities attributed to the four defendants, the trial has so far had the perverse effect of deepening, rather than resolving, some of the more persistent mysteries of the World Trade Center attack.
Who, if anyone, supplied the forged documents? Did the defendants act alone or were they supported by another group, or perhaps a foreign Government? And above all, what was their motive?
"In reading all the accounts of the trial, what strikes me is that something is missing," said Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism specialist at the Rand Corporation, a research institute. "An incomplete picture is emerging. It's harder than ever to put it in a wider context of why these particular guys on their own would have done this."
On trial are four men -- Mohammed A. Salameh, Nidal A. Ayyad, Mahmud Abouhalima, and Ahmad M. Ajaj -- accused of having conspired to make and transport the bomb that exploded in the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, killing six people and causing millions of dollars in damages. The case focuses on law enforcement, on the evidence against the defendants, which, since no one actually saw any of them plant the bomb, is largely circumstantial.
And that means that many questions will be raised and then left unanswered. For example, there are the various fake passports that have surfaced in the case. Mr. Ajaj, a Palestinian who worked at a pizza place in Houston, was found to be carrying four passports -- as well as six manuals on bomb-making and other elements of warfare -- when he came to the United States from Pakistan last Sept. 1. In addition to his real Jordanian passport, Mr. Ajaj was carrying Swedish, British and Saudi Arabian passports, under different names.
Where did a 26-year-old refugee get four passports? What did he intend to do with them? How did he have the money to be traveling on a $2,500 first-class ticket from Pakistan? Who gave him the military manuals? The questions suggest themselves, but because the prosecutors do not have to prove anything beyond that the defendants conspired to blow up the building, the trial does not promise to get into the answers.
But the trial has produced plenty of hints about the existence of a kind of penumbra of terrorism far larger than the four men accused of actually carrying out the blast. Indeed, some experts have concluded that the four men, if they were responsible for the attack at all, were likely only foot soldiers following the commands of higher-ranking plotters elsewhere.
Some specialists speculate, for example, that Iraq may have ultimately been behind the attack, though they say there is no clear proof.
Central to the theory is the role played by two Iraqis in the case, who have been indicted in the bombing but who fled the country after the explosion. One is Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who arrived in the United States on Sept. 1 last year on the same plane as Mr. Ajaj. He was holding an Iraqi passport but no American visa. He was nonetheless allowed to enter the country when he applied for political asylum.
Six months later, right after the bombing, Mr. Yousef, whose fingerprints were on the military manuals in Mr. Ajaj's possession and who is believed by the authorities to have helped build the bomb, fled the country and is believed by investigators to have returned to Iraq, although his present whereabouts are unknown.
The other Iraqi is Abdul Rahman Yasin, who was questioned by the F.B.I. after the bombing, and then he, too, left the country, also going to Iraq, according to a family friend.
 
How Much Did Iraq Know?
 Terrorism experts are struck by the fact that two Iraqis came to the country a few months before the bombing and both then reportedly returned to Iraq after it. Given the tight control of Iraq by the regime of Saddam Hussein, it seems to some experts unlikely that Mr. Yousef and Mr. Yasin could have carried out their activities without the knowledge of the Iraqi authorities.
"It's almost inconceivable, given the nature of Iraqi society, that somebody could be involved in an act as dramatic as the W.T.C. bombing and then go back to Iraq, unless it were done under Iraqi direction," said Laurie Mylroie, a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. "It's a totalitarian state."
And if the Iraqi authorities did know of their activities, could the attack on the trade center have been, at least in part, an officially approved act of vengeance against the United States for the bombing of Baghdad during the Gulf war?
 
No Clear Conclusions
 But other clues make it impossible to draw clear conclusions. There is, for one thing, the upcoming trial of 15 Muslim men, grouped around a blind Egyptian-born cleric, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who are accused of plotting to bomb several targets in New York, including the United Nations and the Hudson River tunnels. The indictment indicates that the plots were thwarted before they could be carried out.
Transcripts of tapes of conversations between F.B.I. agents and an informer, Emad Salem, who infiltrated the group around Mr. Abdel Rahman, show further intriguing international connections and ambitions.
Mr. Salem, for example, told one of his F.B.I. handlers that Mr. Abdel Rahman had contacts with representatives of Hamas, the extreme Palestinian organization, in Pakistan, and even seemed able to give orders to Hamas members playing some undisclosed role in the Afghanistan war.
Mr. Salem also says that Mr. Abdel Rahman gave orders to his followers to assassinate the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak, during an official visit to the United States last year, though the plot was dropped when Mr. Mubarak failed to make an expected visit to New York.
Perhaps, some experts say, Iraqi agents used the group around Mr. Abdel Rahman to enable them to carry out their purposes, at the same time supplying the men for whom Mr. Abdel Rahman was a spiritual guide with the means to carry out objectives of their own.
But while Mr. Abdel Rahman and some of the other defendants in the two terror cases are deeply religious Muslims with a religiously inspired hatred of Mr. Mubarak, they are, at the same time, not believed to be friendly to the regime of Mr. Hussein, who is one of the most secular of the major Arab leaders.
 
Tantalizing Hints
 The trial itself, which is to continue today in spite of what apparently were suicide attempts last week by Mr. Ajaj and by a defendant in the upcoming case, has focused on the clues gathered from the trade center rubble and the movements of figures like Mr. Ajaj and Mr. Yousef. As it does so, it throws off tantalizing hints of other matters and then drops them before coming up with answers.
Among the biggest question is why people like the four defendants, newly established in the United States and working hard to build better lives for themselves and their families, would have become involved in terrorism against their new country.
Here, too, various specialists have offered various explanations: that they were motivated by religious fervor, that they were manipulated, or perhaps paid, by foreign intelligence agents. But, because few if any of the defendants are expected to take the stand, it is not likely that those questions will be put directly to them in the courtroom.

HEADLINE: Weapon-Sale Loans Keep Americans Working;
Risky Business

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"No Loans to Boost Arms Sales (editorial, Nov. 3) deserves all support. As you point out, it is neither in the long-term security interests of the United States, nor is it morally justified, to encourage defense contractors with United States tax dollars (that is, with loan guarantees) to export weapons to countries that could then turn those same weapons against United States troops. 
 Further, with the United States already the largest arms exporter to the third world, the provision of loan guarantees to importing countries will further undermine any prospects for international control.
Rather than support policies that would lead to an arms trade free for all, the Senate needs to demonstrate its support for a more principled approach to this serious problem.
Given that the United States and European Community are now responsible for some 86 percent of arms-transfer agreements to the third world (1992 figures), effective control of this trade can only come about through coordinated action on both sides of the Atlantic. Such action will require the United States and European Community governments to agree on clearly defined criteria governing arms exports, supported by mandatory consultation before exports take place.
An important tool to insure effective coordination between the United States and European Community would be adoption of an international code of conduct on arms exports. Besides defining clear criteria, a code would allow parliaments, the news media and nongovernmental organizations to monitor governmental actions against objective standards.
Thus, the code would increase government accountability in this field and insure that regional security and human rights considerations are assessed alongside short-term economic benefits.
Support for a code of conduct on arms exports has been expressed by the European Parliament, the German Bundesrat and the Irish Government. Moreover, legislative bills based on a code are to be presented before both United States houses this month.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD;
San Antonio's Wild About Free Trade

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Nov. 12

 BODY:
More than half of all the goods exported from anywhere in the United States to Mexico pass through San Antonio. Two hundred companies based here, with 65,000 workers, have major business in Mexico. About 1.2 million Mexican visitors come here each year, spending $500 million.
And, as Mayor Nelson Wolff puts it, "I have only one picture of a president in my office, and it's President Salinas." 
 So if there is any major city in America that has reason to watch with anxiety over the possibility that Congress may reject the North American Free Trade Agreement, it is San Antonio, a city that has staked much of its future on the trade accord and that city leaders like to portray as a kind of Hong Kong to Mexico's China -- a city poised to take off as a banking, trading and shipping hub in a new world of trade without barriers.
The enthusiasm here for the trade agreement is palpable, not just among political and commercial leaders but also among many workers, whose jobs are already tied to Mexican trade. As the House of Representatives prepares to vote on the trade pact on Wednesday, a city delegation led by Mayor Wolff will be in Washington for the last few days of the debate, its fifth pro-agreement lobbying trip this year.
Even the chief A.F.L.-C.I.O. official here says he agrees that the pact, which would gradually eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States, would clearly benefit San Antonio. But he hastens to add that he still opposes it because he shares the view of the labor federation's national leadership that there would be a net loss of jobs in the country as a whole.
Others who are wholeheartedly in favor of the agreement say they are struggling to understand how the pact became so controversial.
"I'm dumbfounded, to tell you the truth," said Al Silva, general manager of Labatt Food Service, a $120 million-a-year food-distribution company that recently began a venture in Mexico City with a warehouse that serves about 50 hotels and restaurants there.
"Three or four years ago, it wouldn't have occurred to me that Mexico would go this far to break down its barriers," Mr. Silva said. "Now they're ready to drop the last barrier, and we're rebuffing them."
"We're taught to believe in free enterprise and free markets," he said. Referring to the President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mr. Silva added: "I might have believed it if Salinas said, 'Only kidding, we're not going to do it.' But I never would have believed that we would be the ones to put our own wall up."
 
Transportation Hub
 San Antonio, now the 10th largest city in the United States with a population of about one million, finds itself so entwined with Mexico for both geographical and cultural reasons. It is a major juncture for both interstate highways and rail lines leading to Mexico's major cities. And it is as close to Monterrey, the major industrial city of northern Mexico, as it is to Dallas.
Founded in 1718 by Spanish settlers, San Antonio has a long history as a trade outpost for both colonial Spain and Mexico. With a distinct Old World feel and with 56 percent of its population of Mexican descent, it is a city in which Mexicans feel comfortable and prefer as a site for establishing business operations, said Humberto Hernandez Haddad, Mexico's Consul General here.
"The most important element is that you can find a mentality here that is really able to understand Mexico and the Mexicans," Mr. Hernandez Haddad said in an interview. Nearly 50 Mexican companies, ranging from a plastics recycling company to a securities brokerage, had established American headquarters here, more than in any other city in the United States, he said.
A companion view was echoed by executives at companies based here that do business in Mexico. The companies manufacture a broad array of goods, from bowling balls and golf clubs to sunglasses and biomedical equipment.
"People here have really made an effort to understand the Mexican culture, said Blair Labatt, the president of the Labatt company. "To a lot of us, it's second nature to go to Mexico. It's a lot of fun, as a matter of fact."
 
Slower Growth Feared
 While some people here fear that the defeat of the trade agreement could spell economic doom for San Antonio, a more common view among both American and Mexican executives is that it would slow the growth that the city and many businesses here are anticipating.
"The general feeling is that freer trade has been good to us, and free trade will be even better," said Al Martinez-Fonts, the president of Texas Commerce Bank-San Antonio and chairman of the local Chamber of Commerce.
Peter Holt, president of a local family-owned company that sells used construction equipment like bulldozers and backhoes to Mexicans and whose net revenue has climbed from $6 million to $30 million in the last four years, said, "If Nafta is defeated it would not stop us, but it would slow down that kind of phenomenal growth."
Mr. Holt said the number of welders, mechanics and other employees here in San Antonio had risen from 15 to 60 in the same period. "These are people who are benefiting from free trade. These are not elitist bankers sitting on Wall Street."
 
More Jobs for Region
 Even Jesse Bielefeld, the president of the local chapter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, said the pact means jobs for the region.
"San Antonio will do well if it passes," he said. "I have never denied that it will. It's pretty much a foregone conclusion that San Antonio would be at the hub of everything that's going on." But he added that such growth would come at the expense of much of the rest of the country.
About 7 or 8 percent of the Texas work force is unionized, only half the national average, according to a spokesman for the labor federation in Austin. Nonetheless, the unions are still mounting a vigorous campaign against the pact.
Other pact opponents say they see no guarantee that benefits from the pact will extend to the entire population of the city. Despite the boom of recent years, a recent report by Partnership for Hope, a local community planning organization, found that a higher percentage of people here lived in crowded or deficient housing than in any other major American city. The organization based its conclusions on data from the Census Bureau.
Three of the four Representatives whose districts include San Antonio are strong supporters of the trade agreement, but the fourth, Henry B. Gonzalez, a Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, is an outspoken opponent. If the agreement passes, he said, American banks could use foreign operations to evade United States banking laws and regulations.
Still, the dominant sentiment here is clearly in favor of the trade pact. "Most people understand what it is and they can see what it means for them," said Jorge Gonzalez, an economics professor at Trinity University here. "They are seeing free trade at work."
At the same time, there is considerable worry about what defeat of the pact would mean, especially if Mexico retaliated with a new round of its own tariffs or other punitive measures.
Professor Gonzalez noted that about 20 percent of all Christmas sales in San Antonio are to Mexican customers. If Congress rejects the accord, he added, it could mean a disastrous Christmas season for local merchants.
Rejection of the pact could lead to a sudden devaluation of the peso. It might also prompt the Mexican Government to begin strictly enforcing what is now a much-ignored requirement that Mexicans who cross the border carry no more than $50 worth of goods bought in the United States without paying steep tariffs on them.
But others say that no matter what happens, Mexicans will do anything they can to avoid punishing San Antonio. "The Mexicans know that of any city in the U.S., bar none, their friends are in San Antonio," said Mayor Wolff. "They'll remember that we stood with them through all this."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Wall Street rewards a tight strategic focus at La Quinta.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell

 BODY:
DID you hear the one about the traveling salesman? Well, this one can be told in mixed company.
After lackluster earnings almost precipitated a proxy fight for La Quinta Inns two years ago, La Quinta stock has been flexing its muscles in recent months. From trading mostly in the $10 to $11 range for much of last year (adjusted for a 3-for-2 split last month) the stock has about tripled, closing at $32.375 on Friday. 
 About those salesmen? Well, salesmen and saleswomen are the main customers of La Quinta (pronounced La KEEN-tah), which has 215 lodgings in 29 states, concentrated in the Sun Belt. While most hotel chains try to cast a wider net, the narrow focus of La Quinta, based in San Antonio, has clearly been paying off.
"We've been recommending purchase of La Quinta stock and we continue to recommend it," said Michael G. Mueller, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "We believe its management is implementing a well-designed game plan for maximizing La Quinta's earnings and cash flow as industry supply and demand improve over the next few years."
The new management was installed in 1992 at the insistence of Sid R. Bass and Lee M. Bass, the Texas billionaires, and their adviser, Thomas M. Taylor, who own 32.5 percent of La Quinta stock. The next largest investor, Geo Capital, owns 11 percent. Shareholders of La Quinta averted a proxy fight in 1991 by electing four directors backed by the Bass brothers.
The appeal of the stock, Mr. Mueller of Montgomery Securities said, is its significant operating leverage in a recovering economy.
"Each 1 percent change of occupancy rates results in an 8 or 9 cents change in reported earnings per share," he said. "And each $1 change in average room rates is worth 17 cents a share."
Mr. Mueller is estimating earnings of $1.24 this year, compared with 98 cents last year, adjusted for the stock split, and $1.45 in the calendar year 1994. That could soar to $2.10 in 1994 if La Quinta increases its occupancy rate to 72 percent by then (from 66 percent now) and its average room rate to about $49 (from $47 now).
While that is a big "if," those are the rates achieved in 1992 by Marriott's Hampton Inns, one of La Quinta's largest direct rivals.
La Quinta Inns recently extended a cash tender offer, as part of a merger agreement with La Quinta Motor Inns L.P., to acquire all 3.5 million partnership units at $13 a unit.
La Quinta owns 11.4 percent of the partnership's units, and manages the 31 La Quinta Inns owned by the partnership. Mr. Mueller said the proposed acquisition price was reasonable and would benefit La Quinta.
Michael A. Depatie, the senior vice president of finance for La Quinta, said the tender was expected to close at the end of this month.
The chain wants to buy the units to help the limited partnership refinance $65 million in debt due in November 1994, and pay for renovations and logo changes at La Quinta properties. All 215 properties are expected to be revamped by next summer, at a total cost of $55 million.
"Before, we tried to be all things to all people, targeting business and leisure travel through mass advertising," said John Kaegi, the senior vice president of marketing for the chain. "Now we understand the proper role for a player our size is to target narrowly, rather than to diffuse our resources over too many targets."
La Quinta's customers are usually traveling a territory and working on commission, he said, adding, "They're the backbone of industrial America."
Founded in 1968, La Quinta is adding properties at the rate of one a month, primarily by converting existing properties. "The cost of conversion is probably 60 to 70 percent of building a new one," Mr. Kaegi said. "A frequent scenario is that we pay $2 million for a property and put in another $1 million, when it would have cost us $5 million to build a new one."

HEADLINE: NATION CONSIDERS MEANS TO DISPOSE OF ITS PLUTONIUM

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
In 16 unremarkable concrete bunkers built by the Army for a war with Hirohito and Hitler, the United States has begun assembling about 50 tons of plutonium, one of the most expensive materials ever produced and perhaps the most important to safeguard. The Energy Department says the bunkers, each about the size of a two-car garage, are going to be used for interim storage, meaning six or seven years.
 But plutonium, which was invented by the Energy Department's predecessor, the Manhattan Project, may turn out to be the hardest thing on earth to dispose of. And at the Energy Department, "interim" can have an elastic meaning. "Immediate" tends to mean several years. "Several years" can mean never. 
The Energy Department stopped making plutonium for bombs in the 1980's, but the stockpile of it is growing because the United States is now dismantling obsolete nuclear warheads.
 
No Easy Answers
 On Sept. 27 President Clinton announced the formation of an inter-agency task force to consider how much plutonium the nation needs in the post-Soviet era, and how to dispose of what is surplus.
 The Energy Department is also drawing up a plan for its far-flung weapons production complex for the next century and an environmental impact statement for the whole weapons program. The National Academy of Sciences is also studying the question. But officials are choosing among a short list of unattractive options.
 "I don't think people have a really good answer for what is going to happen to the plutonium," said Rich Loghry, general manager of the Texas plant where the nation's plutonium is being stockpiled.
One hurdle is psychological; the Energy Department cannot bring itself to think of its invention as waste.
 Developing a consensus may take years, and in the meantime there is "interim storage."
 
Comparisons With Gold
 Storage, in fact, may be the leading option, but even this is tricky. Plutonium loses half its radioactivity every 24,000 years, so it will reach background levels of radioactivity in 10 "half-lives," or 240,000 years; the American political system is focused largely on problems that can be solved in less than four.
 In the short term, storage at the Pantex plant near Amarillo, Tex., is affordable. Pantex's annual operating budget is only $210 million, much of it for security.
 Plutonium is more expensive than gold, though the cost of an ounce is difficult to calculate since the price includes the cost of production cleanup and that has not yet been paid. Tens of billions of dollars will be required to clean up messes in South Carolina and Washington State that were left behind by plutonium production.
 Plutonium is more important to safeguard than is gold; stolen gold cannot blow up a city. If the United States wanted to contrast the relative importance of these materials, it might put the plutonium at the center of Fort Knox, and leave the gold at the periphery, to distract thieves.
 But what is plutonium's value? Department officials say the material has tremendous energy value, and that is true. A recent study for Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said that 50 tons of plutonium could be diluted to provide one-third of the fuel for seven large civilian reactors that now run on uranium, and that it would take 20 years to use up.
 
The Public's Perception
 That is almost too long, since most of the reactors now running are nearing the end of their economic lives and are likely to be retired in 20 years.
 But the nation's utility companies do not even want to discuss taking the plutonium. Executives complain that such discussions only reinforce the public's association of nuclear power with nuclear war. Besides, lightly enriched uranium, which they use now, is cheap.
 Also, using plutonium in a reactor licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would mean holding a public hearing, something the utilities view with distaste verging on phobia.
 But a reactor is the simplest way to actually destroy the plutonium, atom by atom, just the way it was produced.
 Thomas Cochran, a nuclear weapons expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, noted that it took many years of many reactors running to make the current stockpile. Although heat energy for electricity production would be released, it would still take substantial engineering work to build or modify existing civilian reactors to use the plutonium, and then years of careful operation to consume it.
 "It takes you exactly the same effort to destroy it as it does to produce it," Dr. Cochran said. A Poor Track Record
 The Battelle Memorial Institute, an Ohio-based research and development concern, has proposed finishing two abandoned reactors, the Washington Public Power Supply System plants 1 and 3, with $3.5 billion in privately raised money and letting the Energy Department run them on plutonium; the money would be repaid with electricity sales.
 Such a plan would hold down the number of places where plutonium had to be stockpiled, but the costs and demand for power are uncertain.
 Also, the department has chalked up a poor track record lately on its management of complicated projects, from the Clinch River Breeder Reactor in Tennessee to the weapons plants to the Superconducting Supercollider in Texas. Congress does not seem likely to write a blank check for the project, especially to the Energy Department.
 Although reactors would not destroy all the plutonium loaded in them as fuel, they would greatly reduce the risk of proliferation, since the fission products created as the plutonium is split are intensely radioactive and thus would be too dangerous to steal.But at the moment, there is no permanent storage for spent fuel either, so the effect would be to solve the problem of the accumulating stockpile by vastly increasing the radioactivity of waste that must still remain in human custody until a repository is built. And no one knows where that will be.
 The plutonium could also be mixed into glass, , which is what the Energy Department plans to do with the tens of millions of gallons of toxic, radioactive liquid wastes left over from plutonium production at the Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., and the Hanford reservation, near Richland, Wash. Mixed in glass with the wastes, the plutonium would be far too radioactive to be easily retrieved for weapons use by terrorists.
 Three years ago, the department dedicated a vitrification plant at Savannah River, but because of technical problems, it has yet to operate. Mr. Cochran, the expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said, "The complication is, since the Department of Energy can't get its act together on the vitrification to begin with, you're basically hanging this onto a problem that's not working very well already."
 
Birds and Barbed Wire
 Which brings the department back to storage -- the bunkers standing amid the milo and winter wheat of the Texas Panhandle, with sand hill cranes flying overhead and prairie dogs scampering beneath. Each bunker, built to store munitions in World War II, is now covered by dirt and scrubby weeds on three sides; the fourth side is obstructed by huge concrete blocks, called "access denial barriers," which are moved with heavy-duty forklifts. These protective measures are backed up by guards with M-60 machine guns and so much razor wire that a joke among plant employees is that if half the wire were removed, the place would look like a maximum-security prison.
 The department says fire, flood and explosion are not significant hazards, either to the bunkers or the disassembly of the nuclear weapons that proceeds them. But others are less sure.
 Opponents of storage say they do not want to stand in the way of dismantling the bombs and missiles that can cause millions of deaths almost instantaneously, but neither do they want all the remaining risk on their doorsteps.

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Monday about the search for ways to dispose of plutonium described the bunker shown at a plant near Amarillo, Tex., incorrectly. It is being used to test a storage system; no plutonium is stored in the bunker now.
An article on Nov. 15 about the retirement of nuclear weapons misstated the origin of plutonium. Physicists manufactured it in 1940 in early work on the atomic bomb, but they did not invent it; it was subsequently detected in nature.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices to Rule on Felon's Right to Own Gun

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether states may nullify the restrictions imposed by Federal law on a convicted felon's right to own a gun.
The question has divided Federal courts around the country, meaning that people with identical criminal histories can face opposite consequences from their gun ownership. That fact almost certainly led the Court to take up the question, although the Justice Department had told the Court there was no need to do so. 
 A Federal law, known as the felon-in-possession law, makes it a crime for those who have been convicted of serious offenses to own a firearm. The exceptions in the law are for convictions for antitrust and other business-related violations.
All states have laws or procedures that can restore a convict's civil rights, like the right to vote, serve as a juror or hold certain government jobs. The question dividing the courts is whether those state laws, which clearly prevent state convictions from being used to bar gun ownership, also act in the same way to insulate any Federal convictions the person may have had.
 
Conflicting Conclusions
 In two separate cases, which were combined for the Supreme Court appeal, men from Tennessee and West Virginia had their civil rights restored after serving sentences for felony convictions. Some years later, each man was charged with owning a gun in violation of the felon-in-possession law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, rejected their arguments that the state laws had restored their rights to gun ownership despite the Federal law.
Federal appellate circuits covering parts of the West and the Midwest -- the Ninth Circuit, based in San Francisco, and the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis -- had earlier reached the opposite conclusion. When the Fourth Circuit issued its ruling last May, the court said that it knew it was creating a conflict with the other courts but that it was not willing to infer that Congress intended to let state law override the Federal law.
Lenard Beecham, one of the men whose appeals the Justices agreed to hear, had his civil rights restored by Tennessee after serving a sentence for a Federal gun possession conviction in 1979. In 1990, while operating a used-car dealership in Raleigh, N.C., he began buying and selling guns. He answered "no" on a licensed firearms dealer's Federal form to the question of whether he had ever been convicted of a felony, and then sold a gun to an undercover Federal agent.
A Federal jury convicted him of making a false statement as well as being a felon in possession of a gun, but the judge set aside the conviction on the ground that the earlier restoration of his rights by Tennessee meant that the Federal law did not apply to him. The Fourth Circuit then reinstated the conviction. The case is Beecham v. United States, No. 93-445.
The Court's other activities today included these:
 
Abortion Case
 Without comment, the Court refused to hear a challenge to a provision of Mississippi's abortion law that requires teen-age girls to receive the permission of both parents, or of a judge, before getting an abortion.
The law was upheld in May by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, which ruled that because the law had not yet taken effect, the three abortion clinics that brought the challenge were not entitled to present evidence showing that the law presented an undue burden to women seeking abortion.
The "undue burden" standard was set by the Supreme Court in its 1992 ruling on a Pennsylvania abortion law, and the Justices have yet to take a case to define the new standard further. Last year the Court turned down a challenge to another Mississippi abortion provision, which imposes a 24-hour waiting period.
Catherine Albisa, a lawyer representing the Mississippi clinics, said today that her organization, the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, would probably file new challenges to the law now that both provisions were in effect. She called the law the most restrictive in the country to go into effect, and said the new lawsuit would seek to document that "young women and poor women in Mississippi have a harder time getting abortions than anywhere else."
The 24-hour waiting period has been in effect since August 1992, and Ms. Albisa said many women were going out of state for their abortions. The parental consent provision took effect this summer.
One issue the Supreme Court left unresolved in its 1992 Pennsylvania abortion decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, was under what circumstances plaintiffs would be able to challenge abortion restrictions before they took effect.
While the case today, Barnes v. Mississippi, No. 93-314, would have given the Justices a chance to discuss that question, there are other cases still in the lower courts that will also provide that opportunity when they reach the Supreme Court.
Last spring the Eighth Circuit blocked enforcement of a 24-hour waiting period in North Dakota after Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David H. Souter indicated in a brief opinion in the case that those seeking to challenge abortion restrictions need not demonstrate, as the Eighth Circuit had earlier held, that the restriction would be unconstitutional in all circumstances.
 
Construction Wages
 Without comment, the Court turned down New York City's appeal of a ruling permitting a suit on behalf of construction workers who were not paid prevailing wages on a federally financed contract to renovate city-owned housing.
A Federal law, the Davis-Bacon Act, requires that work on federally financed construction projects be paid at the prevailing wages in the locality. In this case, the city was paying $90 to $95 per worker per day to the Chinese-American Planning Council, a community group that was the contractor on a job intended to provide work to recent immigrants, former drug addicts and others at high risk of unemployment.
The legal question in the case, New York City v. Chan, No. 93-534, is whether the Federal law can be enforced through private lawsuits of the sort brought against both the city and the planning council by the 35 workers, who are requesting back pay and damages. The Court probably turned down the case because the suit has not yet gone to trial.

HEADLINE: U.S. Threatens to Look Eastward for Trade Allies

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration threatened tonight that if the European allies did not show more flexibility in the stalemated global trade negotiations, Washington would move quickly to develop an alternative trading association with Asia.
In a briefing with reporters at the White House, a group of senior Administration diplomats and trade officials said they were treating this week's economic summit meeting in Seattle as an opportunity to lay the groundwork for a possible trading association, if the stalled negotiations with Europe over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade are not completed. 
 The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which includes the United States and Canada as members, opens in Seattle on Wednesday and will be followed by a meeting of top leaders of member nations, including President Clinton. It is the largest meeting ever of American and Pacific leaders.
"The Europeans have to recognize that APEC can be a building block," a senior Administration official said. "If GATT is a failure, APEC stands out there as an alternative way to solve the problem" for the United States, the official said.
Asian leaders have been cool to the idea of transforming the forum into a trading bloc, and it is not at all clear that the Administration could entice them in that direction. Nevertheless, the Administration's blunt threat underscores Washington's broad disenchantment with seven years of global trade talks that have been stymied by squabbles with Europe, particularly France, over its refusal to cut farm subsidies.
 
APEC as Antidote
 "I think that our trading relationships in the Pacific will be enhanced by this APEC meeting," the senior official said. If the GATT talks fail, he added, "there is some risk that the world economic system will be in turmoil. APEC can be an antidote, particularly to European stubbornness. APEC will stand as a beacon toward which we can turn."
A successful meeting in Seattle, the official added, "will put some additional pressure on the Europeans." He said the pressure will be stronger if the North American Free Trade Agreement is approved.
"It will look a little lonely" for the European Community, the official added. "The antidote to that is a multilateral trade agreement called GATT. Hopefully APEC will be a stimulus for them" to make concessions.
The official noted that "we are just beginning to develop an integrated architecture for APEC. The very fact that APEC leaders are getting together takes it to another level of integration."
President Clinton's authority to negotiate a global trade deal effectively expires on Dec. 15, so if an agreement cannot be reached by then, the Administration will have to win Congressional approval of an extension, which could be difficult in light of the recent fight over the North American Free Trade Agreement. Hence the urgency with which the Administration is trying to pressure the Europeans with the Asia-Pacific forum.
 
Pressuring the French
 Explaining this tactic, the senior Administration official said that the French in particular would never make the necessary concessions unless they believed they were the only ones standing in the way of a successful GATT agreement. Passage of the North American pact and a successful Asia-Pacific meeting, the official said, would definitely enhance those prospects and put additional pressure on the French.
Many economists say that a GATT agreement, which sets trade rules and limits tariffs for commerce among 116 nations, would stimulate the global economy much more than the North American Free Trade Agreement, which applies only to the United States, Mexico and Canada.
Raising the prospect of a deal with nations in the forum, which includes some of the world's fastest growing economies, like Japan, China, Indonesia, Taiwan and Singapore, is a threat to European businesses that count on continued access to the United States market, the world's largest.

HEADLINE: Argentine President Clears Hurdle to Second Term

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES, Nov. 15

 BODY:
A few months ago it seemed almost a political impossibility. President Carlos Saul Menem was saying he would change the Argentine Constitution to permit his immediate re-election in 1995, despite the fact that he would have to win a raft of votes in Congress from members of the opposition Radical Civic Union.
Few now doubt Mr. Menem's political deftness. In an agreement at the presidential residence on Sunday, Mr. Menem, the Peronist Party leader, signed an deal with Raul Alfonsin, leader of the Radicals and former President, in which the Radicals will support Mr. Menem in his desired constitutional changes. 
 In return, the Radicals got an agreement from Mr. Menem to transfer some executive powers to Congress.
The Menem-Alfonsin agreement, if ratified by the Radicals in early December, makes Mr. Menem the odds-on favorite to win re-election in 1995 and govern the country through 1999.
 
Most Astute Politician'
 "Without a doubt Menem has surprised everyone and pulled the rabbit out of the hat," said Steven Darch, president of Banco Mariva, a major commercial bank in Buenos Aires. "He is a rainmaker, the most astute politician in Argentina, possibly in Latin America."
Today, Mr. Menem signed a decree calling off a national plebiscite scheduled for Sunday in which the public was to have been asked to vote on whether the Constitution should be changed. It was a vote Mr. Menem was almost sure to win. The threat of losing the plebiscite, plus an embarrassing defeat in Congressional elections in October, plus the growing popularity of Mr. Menem, evidently forced the Radicals into the agreement.
"They knew they would lose in 1995 no matter which Peronist candidate they ran against, and that if Menem was not allowed to run, he would come back in the next election and they'd lose that as well," said Alberto Kohan, secretary general of the Peronist Party. "So the thinking was better to let Menem have his time in office now and start preparing a credible Radical candidate for 1999."
 
Influx of Investment
 Business executives and political analysts said the prospect of a second Menem term would boost international investor confidence in Argentina, adding to the billions of investment dollars that have poured in over the past three years, creating one of the most vibrant economies in Latin America.
Over the past four years, Mr. Menem has turned Argentina from an inflation-plagued country with an antiquated industrial base and a stridently anti-Washington, isolationist political bent, into one of the continent's models for economic and political reform.
He has sold off giant state industries, begun paying on Argentina's huge foreign debt and brought the inflation rate down from 5,000 percent in 1989 to 8 percent this year. Over the past two years, the country's economy has grown at almost 9 percent, and it is expected to grow 6 percent this year.
He has also made Argentina the closest ally in South America to the United States, scrapping the country's ballistic missile program and its nuclear weapons program and aiding the anti-Iraq coalition in the Persian Gulf War.
 
Discreet Support for Menem
 For business, the prospect that Mr. Menem would leave office in mid-1995, when he six-year term expires, created uncertainties. And though executives were fearful of openly supporting him for re-election, they repeatedly said they preferred another term for Mr. Menem so that his economic reforms could be made more permanent.
Under the preliminary agreement with Mr. Alfonsin, Mr. Menem will be able to stand for re-election for a four-year second term. The constitutional provision for one six-year presidential term will be changed to two consecutive four-year terms, similar to the United States system.
But Mr. Menem would have to step down in mid-1999.
The agreement also removes a requirement that the President be a Roman Catholic, creates the office of Coordinating Minister of the Cabinet, akin to that of a Prime Minister, who must answer to Congress, and gives the Congress the ultimate authority to intervene in the provinces in times of fiscal crisis, a decision that is now in the hands of the executive.
"The Radicals, who are in a very weak position, see this as an opportunity to get more checks and balances on the executive," said Felipe Noguera, a political analyst and a leading pollster.
 
Weakness of Opposition
 Many said the agreement underlined just how weak the Radical Party has become during the Menem years. Though Mr. Alfonsin, who was president between 1984 and 1989, is still the party's leader, the Argentine public vividly remembers his last months in office, a time of devastating hyperinflation and economic and social upheaval. The Radicals had hoped to recoup some power in mid-term elections last October, but were unable to use a string of corruption scandals in the Menem Government to weaken support for the Peronists.
But there are still risks for Mr. Menem. One is that the Radical delegation in Congress could revolt against the agreement and refuse to approve the constitutional changes.
Another is that before the 1995 elections, one of the many corruption scandals involving some of Mr. Menem's friends and former top aides might blow up in his face.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Ranchers;
Increased Trade in Mexican Cattle Brings a Rise in Disease to U.S. Dairies

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA TERESA, N.M., Nov. 12

 BODY:
Before dawn, bawling calves from Mexico tumbled out of trailers and turned the sandy corrals of the inspection station here into a choking storm of dust. Hours later, the calves were examined, dunked in vats of pesticides to kill ticks and then herded into pens on the American side of the border, where they were sold to ranchers in New Mexico, Texas and other Western states.
More than 1.2 million Mexican calves passed through this and nine other smaller inspection stations along the border during the last year, four times the annual number a decade ago. Mexican cattle producers earn roughly $500 million a year selling young animals to Americans, who fatten them for sale to slaughterhouses. 
 The largely unrestricted trade in young cattle from Mexico is cited by ranchers as evidence of how free trade provides economic benefits in both countries. But as lobbying over the North American Free Trade Agreement reaches its final days, a darker side of this seemingly bright spot in Mexican-American trade is emerging.
Bovine tuberculosis has broken out in dairy herds near here and in two other Texas communities. And the Federal authorities say the most likely source is cattle imported into the United States from Mexico, where the disease is common.
 
Lowering Health Standards?
 The trade agreement does not address the disease directly, saying only that each country will be allowed to enforce its own animal health regulations. Under current procedures, cattle have to be certified free of the disease before coming into the United States from Mexico.
Opponents of the trade accord have seized on the outbreak of bovine tuberculosis to support their argument that free trade in other industries could lower American health and sanitary standards. They assert that the increase in trade in Mexican cattle, which has led to higher numbers of infected carcasses in American meat-packing plants, is a warning sign. They say that the infection was an unintended consequence of free trade and that freer trade will bring more of these kinds of problems.
But proponents of the trade agreement say that governments will adjust to new circumstances just as they have in this case. They point to Mexico's decision last month to institute new testing procedures intended to eradicate the disease in that country.
State and Federal veterinarians say that the spreading bacterial infection, which under rare circumstances can be transmitted to people, is among the worst outbreaks in years and that it comes nearly three decades after the United States had largely eradicated the disease in American cattle.
Word of the outbreak has stirred fear among ranchers across the Midwest and Rocky Mountain states, where most of the nation's cattle are raised and slaughtered. Infected cattle develop respiratory problems that affect their ability to gain weight or produce milk, and when the disease is detected, cattle are either quarantined or slaughtered.
In many ways, the political argument over bovine tuberculosis is a nearly perfect distillation of the larger debate over the trade accord and its effect on American public health and environmental standards: replete with conjecture, scary scenarios, emotion, and, occasionally, hard facts and solidly supported assumptions.
 
Are Problems Exaggerated?
 Jess Burner Jr., a cattle broker from Tornillo, Tex., 40 miles east of here, said in an interview that the problems associated with bovine tuberculosis, while worrisome, had been exaggerated by opponents of the free trade pact. Others, like Dr. Steve A. Marasovich, a retired doctor who operates a dairy east of here in Fabens, Tex., that is under Federal quarantine because of tuberculosis, said the situation was quickly developing into an emergency for the state's dairy industry.
Both men insist that the trade accord does not affect the issue one way or the other. "Whether or not Nafta passes, it will not affect trade in calves," Mr. Burner said. "We are going to see that our industry and our people are protected."
But the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, a farm research organization based in Minneapolis that is opposed to the trade accord, published a study last month that raised the specter of infected cattle spilling into the United States across an open border, spreading disease to animals and people.
Steve Suppan, the author of the report, said in an interview that the sanitary requirements of the proposed trade accord were not strong enough to protect the $70 billion-a-year American beef and dairy industries, and that the Mexican Government was not well-prepared to eradicate tuberculosis in their cattle.
"Free trade makes it easier for Mexico to sell us cattle," Mr. Suppan said. "Mexico does not have in place the infrastructure to eradicate tuberculosis."
As the debate escalates before the House votes on Wednesday on the trade pact, which would eliminate most barriers to trade in North America over the next decade, several aspects of the bovine tuberculosis debate are not in dispute.
For one, bovine tuberculosis is fast becoming an important reason that carcasses are being condemned as unsafe in American beef packing plants. The number of carcasses at American slaughterhouses found to be infected reached 613 in 1992, 15 times higher than in 1986. Dr. Billy Johnson, an official with a division of the Agriculture Department that investigates animal diseases, said about 80 percent of the condemned carcasses were traced back to animals raised in Mexico.
Secondly, Federal and state veterinary officials are virtually unanimous in their opinion that bovine tuberculosis represents little threat to people. The bacterium that is responsible for the disease in Texas causes a chronic lung and lymph infection in cattle that rarely leads to death, Dr. Johnson said. The organism seldom spreads to people, he said. Pasteurization kills the tuberculosis bacteria in milk, and cooking destroys it in meat.
And third, Dr. Johnson and several state officials said that unless the infection in Texas was brought under control, bovine tuberculosis could cause millions of dollars in losses to ranchers, dairy farmers and feed lot operators across the nation's heartland.
 
Wiping Out Disease in U.S.
 The emergence of bovine tuberculosis as a threat to animal agriculture in the United States has surprised most veterinarians. In 1917, when the incidence of the disease in American cattle was about 5 percent, the United States began slaughtering hundreds of thousands of animals shown to be infected as a way to eradicate the disease. By the mid-1960's, said Dr. Mitchell Essey, a Federal veterinarian, the prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in cattle had dropped to less than 0.002 percent and was considered to be eradicated.
But starting in the early 1980's, the trade in imported cattle with Mexico began to climb sharply, with calves pouring through inspection stations like this one. In 1985, prompted by the discovery of tuberculosis in a carcass at a meat packing plant, the Federal authorities traced the infection back to a dairy herd near El Paso.
After more testing, the authorities quarantined 10 dairy herds in New Mexico and Texas that served the El Paso milk market. Quarantined dairies were allowed to sell milk because of pasteurization, but any animals culled from the herds and sold for slaughter were subjected to more testing and special sales and slaughter requirements.
Four herds are still quarantined around El Paso. On a grey afternoon in Fabens, 30 miles east of El Paso, Dr. Marasovich studied the animals in his quarantined herd and explained the exceptionally tight restrictions he has been under since 1990, when tuberculosis was discovered in a few of the 3,500 animals in the herd.
"I must follow all these rules to sell my animals even though the incidence of tuberculosis in this herd is tiny," he said. "But the Mexican animal, which is coming from a known area of exceptionally high rates of infection is allowed into this country without any restriction at all. All it needs is a certificate that says it has been tested for tuberculosis by a Mexican veterinarian. Whether it actually has been tested is not confirmed and documented."

HEADLINE: Administration Is Narrowing Its List for Fed Post

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
With one of the Federal Reserve Board's seven seats opening up in January, Administration officials are narrowing a list of candidates, saying they want someone who is respected by the financial community and is tough on inflation, but who will also support the Administration's goals for stronger growth.
The officials say they are being careful in preparing their list -- which includes several academics and several Administration economists -- because they recognize that their first nomination for a 14-year Federal Reserve seat will send a strong signal to financial markets, at a time when the Administration continues to count on low rates as an important source of growth for the economy.
 
 
Fear of Nervous Markets
 The last thing the White House wants is to push up long-term interest rates by making markets nervous that the Clinton Administration's nominees will be less tough on inflation than the current Federal Reserve Board. 
 The list of more than a dozen candidates includes three high-level officials: Alan Blinder, a Princeton University professor and a member of the President's Council of Economic Advisers; Alice Rivlin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Alicia Munnell, former chief economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Boston and currently Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy.
Mr. Blinder, Ms. Rivlin and Ms. Munnell have all told acquaintances that they would prefer to stay in their current positions, which are more in the thick of economic policy action than a Federal Reserve post. Still, Administration officials speculated that if President Clinton took a candidate aside and said he or she was his ideal choice, that person might feel pressured to accept.
Administration officials said other candidates under consideration were Peter Kenen, a Princeton University economist; Benjamin Friedman, an economics professor at Harvard University; Sheila Tschinkel, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta, and Roger Brinner, chief economist for DRI/McGraw-Hill, a consulting firm.
Also on the list is William H. Gray 3d, former chairman of the House Budget Committee and now president of the United Negro College Fund. Administration officials say he would be a strong candidate, but they doubt he would accept the post. Another black candidate is Franklin B. Raines, vice chairman of the Federal National Mortgage Association.
William C. Brainard, chairman of Yale University's economics department, and George L. Perry, an economist at the Brookings Institution, were also said to be under consideration.
Several officials called the Administration list-compiling an evolving process that like the search for Supreme Court nominees could undergo last-minute changes.
One official said the Administration had asked Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, for suggestions.
"This is the Administration's first appointment, so obviously you will look at it very closely," Darwin Beck, money market economist at First Boston, said. "The Administration has a good working relationship with chairman Greenspan, and they ought to maintain it by putting someone on who will have an independent opinion, but will nevertheless work well with the board members who are there."
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the Council of Economic Advisers have a smooth working relationionship with chairman Greenspan, and they ought to maintain it by putting someone on who will have an independent opinion, but will nevertheless work well with the board members who are there."
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and the Council of Economic Advisers have a smooth working relationship with the Fed -- Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Greenspan have breakfast together once a week -- and the Administration wants to make sure this nomination does not undermine that. Even Federal Reserve officials acknowledge that the Administration's relationship with the Fed is better than the Bush Administration's.
Mr. Greenspan's term as chairman expires in March 1996, and many economists say that if he is not reappointed, there is a good chance he will step down then, even though his term as a Federal Reserve governor continues until 2006.
All of the board's current members have been appointed by Republican Presidents. President Clinton's opportunity to replace Wayne Angell, an inflation hawk whose term expires Jan 31., will be the first time a Democratic President has appointed a Federal Reserve member in more than a dozen years.
 
 
'Work in the Same Direction'
 An Administration official who insisted on anonymity said, "We're looking for someone who, within the framework of controlling inflation, will be willing to make sure that monetary policy and other elements of economic policy work in the same direction as the President's and not at cross purposes."
Several economists suggested that a Clinton appointee who was tough on inflation, yet wanted to promote the President's growth efforts, might be somewhat less inclined than other Fed members to raise short-term interest rates when growth is picking up, unless there were unmistakable signs of increased inflation. Similarly, if the economy starts to slow down at some point, a Clinton appointee might be more aggressive about wanting to cut rates.
Several officials also said they wanted to name a forceful candidate who would not be cowed by other board members and who could discuss monetary policy on the same plane as Mr. Greenspan, the chairman.
The officials overseeing the selection process are Mr. Bentsen; Bruce Lindsey, the White House personnel director; Robert E. Rubin, director of the National Economic Council, and Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers.

HEADLINE: Choosing Status Quo;
Puerto Rico Avoids Radical Change But Now May Be Ignored by Congress

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, P.R., Nov. 15

 BODY:
With their ballots, Puerto Ricans on Sunday decided for the moment that they preferred just a few "enhancements" in their island's current status as an American commonwealth to the uncertainties of statehood. But with Congress in a belt-tightening and protectionist mood, Puerto Rico's obtaining even limited changes in its relationship with Washington is likely to prove difficult.
By choosing the safe course, in fact, Puerto Rico now runs the risk of being ignored on Capitol Hill. Although President Clinton repeatedly promised to support whatever decision the people reached in Sunday's nonbinding plebiscite, the issue of Puerto Rican status carries many of the same potential risks as the North American Free Trade Agreement, but with few of the potential gains. 
 "Now that it is over, I can say that had statehood or independence won, there would have been a confrontation with Congress," said Representative Jose E. Serrano, a Bronx Democrat who is chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and was neutral during the plebiscite campaign. "But the commonwealth victory may allow some people in Washington to say, 'They chose to remain the same, so let's go on to other issues.' "
The plebiscite, the first on Puerto Rico's status since 1967, drew nearly 1.7 million voters, or 73.6 percent of those eligible. A total of 823,258, or 48.4 percent, favored continuing as a commonwealth, while 785,859, or 46.2 percent favored statehood and 75,253, or 4.4 percent supported independence.
 
'Issue of Rice and Beans'
 Political analysts here said the outcome was an expression of the basic conservatism of Puerto Rican society. Rather than risk the drastic economic and social changes that they feared might come with statehood, the voters chose to remain with a system that has given Puerto Rico a per capita income of $6,200 a year, the highest in Latin America, while seeking some modifications to improve that situation.
"This vote should not be interpreted as a rejection of the United States or its people," Luis Davila Colon, a leading political columnist and television commentator, said of statehood's defeat. "This was an issue of rice and beans. This was about concerns you'd pay more taxes or lose your job."
Under the commonwealth arrangement, which began in 1952, the 3.7 million residents of Puerto Rico pay no Federal income taxes and enjoy some other tax benefits as well. But they are not allowed to vote in Federal elections, have been subject to the military draft and are represented in Congress by a single delegate, who has no vote. In addition, payments under several Federal welfare programs, including Medicaid, are limited at levels far below those for states.
The commonwealth option that won the support of the voters proposes to remedy some of what are seen here as inequalities. The package of enhancements of the current status that the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party wants the government of Puerto Rico to submit to Congress consists of these four elements:
*Full restoration of Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, which until this year exempted local subsidiaries of mainland companies from Federal income taxes on profits earned here. That benefit, intended to help create manufacturing jobs here, is to be reduced by 60 percent over the next five years as part of Washington's efforts to reduce the Federal budget deficit.
*Extension of Supplemental Security Income, a Federal aid program for the elderly and the handicapped, to Puerto Rico. Statehood advocates, who have also lobbied for the program, estimate that such an expansion would cost the Federal Treasury $900 million a year.
*Removing the Federal cap on food stamps to Puerto Ricans so that they receive benefits equal to those distributed to the needy in the states. That change would result in a $700-million-a-year increase in the program, according to estimates by the commonwealth government.
*Special protection for Puerto Rico's main agricultural products through tariffs. Such a provision already exists for coffee, but officials here want similar barriers for other produce because they fear that Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement in particular would bring an influx of cheap Mexican goods.
 
Resistance to Change
 "There will be resistance to any increase in payments to Puerto Rico, no question about it," said Louis Nunez, head of the National Puerto Rican Coalition, a Washington-based advocacy group.
The voters' support for the enhanced commonwealth status faces other obstacles as well. Gov. Pedro Rossello, statehood's leading advocate, promised during the plebiscite campaign that he would fight for the winning option in Washington, no matter how the vote turned out. But on Sunday night he backed away from that pledge. Although he is obligated to present the enhanced-commonwealth package to Congress, the Governor made clear that he would not push it strenuously, saying of the commonwealth forces, "It is up to them to keep their word to the people of Puerto Rico."
Speaking from Washington in a telephone interview, Mr. Serrano, the head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said of the pro-commonwealth party, "The Popular Democratic people have to come up here and push this thing hard themselves, or else it is going to end up on the back burner."
Nevertheless, Mr. Nunez said he was hopeful that Puerto Rico would obtain at least some of the package. He predicted that Congress, eager to avoid a decision on statehood for Puerto Rico, would eventually conclude that it was "a better tactic to enhance the current status so people will be more satisfied" and not agitate for statehood.
But it was Luis Munoz Marin, a commonwealth proponent, who announced after the 1967 plebiscite, when supporters of statehood accounted for only 39 percent of the vote, that "the interminable debate over the political status of Puerto Rico is over." He was wrong then, and nothing about the mood of Puerto Rico or Congress suggests that a similar evaluation would be correct now.

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Jumps 0.8%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
American industry posted its biggest gain in output in nearly a year during October, setting yet another record and further solidifying the view that the economy had picked up markedly in the last two months.
The rise in industrial production, of eight-tenths of a percent, was the fifth in a row. It was also accompanied by upward revisions for September and July, according to the Federal Reserve's monthly report issued today. 
 Although factories, utilities and mines account for less than a third of the overall economy, the performance of this component is regarded as one of the best current indicators of general conditions.
 
 
Vehicle Production Jumps
 "After languishing throughout most of the spring and summer months, the manufacturing sector is now rebounding sharply," commented Donald E. Maude, bond market strategist for Scotia McLeod in New York.
The October advance lifted the Fed's production index to a record 112.2 -- 12.2 percent above its 1987 average -- from 111.4 in September. Although the United States lost more than 250,000 factory jobs from February to September, industry has been setting repeated production records. Manufacturing accounts for about 85 percent of industrial output.
The October gain was paced by a 6.3 percent jump in the output of motor vehicles, partly reflecting a catch-up from output lost to production bottlenecks at the beginning of the new model year, but it extended broadly to other goods as well.
The result was even a bit stronger than analysts expected after digesting, among other things, the Labor Department's report earlier in the month of higher October factory employment and record-setting overtime.
 
'Pretty Good News'
 "It's pretty good news for the economy," James W. Coons, chief economist at the Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, said of today's report, adding that the economy as a whole could expand at a 4 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.8 percent in the July-Septbmer period.
Yet he and others noted that growth has come in fits and starts since the official end of the 1990-91 recession, and they cautioned that growth might well settle back again in the new year.
"I think this is the high-water mark," contended Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist at Carroll McEntee & McGinley and a pessimistic analyst. He pointed to decelerating growth of various monetary gauges, the economic drag of higher taxes and what he sees as new economic "softening" abroad, especially in Japan and Germany, that could depress American exports.
Other analysts have questioned lately the ability of consumers to maintain their recent brisk spending pace, which has climbed faster than their incomes.
In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said business sales climbed eight-tenths of a percent in September, well above the rise in inventories of three-tenths of a percent. This suggested that continued demand would promptly be reflected in new orders.
 
 
Homes Are More Affordable
 Still another report, by the National Association of Realtors, found the typical family was better able to buy a home in the third quarter than in almost 20 years. The association's Housing Affordability Index was 134.5 in the quarter, the best level since the final quarter of 1973.
The Fed's report today showed not only that output hit another record, but that industry operated at 82.4 percent of capacity last month, up a half point from September and the highest rate since August 1990.
Donald H. Straszheim of Merrill Lynch said that while the rise in utilization in the last two months might "raise some eyebrows" about the possibility of supply constraints leading to inflation, he remained skeptical.
He noted that operating rates remained well below the levels at which inflation becomes an issue, beyond the mid-80 percent range, and that the Federal Reserve was probably underestimating the amount of new capacity brought on stream in the last two years.
Moreover, Mr. Straszheim said, the labor market is still slack, and capacity, viewed on a worldwide basis, "is immense."
Output from factories advanced nine-tenths of a percent last month, with production of durable goods up 1.3 percent and nondurables up four-tenths of a percent. Utilities showed a rise of one-tenth of a percent, but mining fell five-tenths after leaping 1.7 percent in September.
Excluding motor vehicles and parts -- assemblies equaled an 11 million unit annual pace, up from 10.1 million in September -- industrial output was up four-tenths of a percent last month, the Fed's report also showed.
 Over all, September's gain, originally put at two-tenths of a percent, was raised to four-tenths of a percent; July's gain was raised to three-tenths of a percent from two-tenths of a percent.
 
 
Furniture and Appliances
 Apart from the automotive sector, production of furniture and appliances was one of the strongest areas. Among nondurables, rising output of food and tobacco, consumer chemicals and fuels more than offset a decline in clothing of eight-tenths of a percent.
Business equipment was strong as well, with information-processing equipment up nine-tenths of a percent. Space and military equipment, however, continued downward, falling nine-tenths of a percent.
The operating rate for factories, up six-tenths of a point, to 81.7 percent, lifted it to one-half point above its 1967-92 average, the Fed noted. Among primary processing industries, the utilization rate reached 85 percent, nearly three points above its longer-run average.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Mexico;
On Border, Mexicans Are Fearful Too

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MATAMOROS, Mexico, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Just two miles from "the other side," in a dusty border slum called Hope, Maria Isabel Vazquez and Gilberto Lozano are trying to plan their future.
He works in an American-owned auto parts factory here, making dashboards for Cadillacs he never sees because they aren't sold in Mexico. Every Monday and Friday she goes to a hiring hall to see if one of the 76 assembly plants in Matamoros has accepted her application for work. Together, they make about $5,000 a year. 
 Their dreams remain simple: to marry, to have children and to stay close to their families, possibly as close as a house in Colonia Esperanza, which in Spanish means Neighborhood of Hope.
 
The Focus of Attention
 As a key vote on a free trade agreement with the United States and Canada has drawn near, attention has been focused on the way Mexicans live. In his debate with Vice President Al Gore last week, Ross Perot explained his opposition to the pact in part by challenging the Administration's assumptions that Mexicans will buy more goods from the United States if tariffs are removed.
"People who don't make any money can't buy anything," he said. But as Miss Vazquez pointed out, they do have some money, and they already spend some of it on American products.
"Like everybody else, we'd like to have something more," Miss Vazquez, 22, said. "But I don't think that we are living in poverty. We have food every day, we have the clothes we need, we have lights and water. We may not have everything, but I think we live well."
People here, one of the most American of Mexican cities just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, Tex., have already seen one economic invasion from "the other side," as they call the United States. In the early 1970's American manufacturers started building big plants called maquiladoras along the border because new laws allowed them to assemble parts here and ship them back to the United States without paying taxes.
 
Factories Employ 36,000
 Now more than 36,000 people in Matamoros work in those factories, and whole communities, like Esperanza, have sprung up along a network of rutted streets that surround the industrial parks. They have come from Veracruz and Monterrey and many other parts of Mexico, lured by work.
What they found were jobs like Mr. Lozano's, which even after nine years working at the same plant pays around $100 a week. Esperanza is a place where pigs roam filthy streets, houses rarely have glass windows and an ammonia smell from two nearby chemical factories sours the air.
Mr. Perot and others who oppose the agreement say the factories here dump toxic wastes that poison the water and cause birth defects. They say low wages in Mexico will cost Americans jobs because factories will relocate here. But fear clearly crosses the border. Mr. Lozano said the rumor around his factory and others here is that if the pact is passed, on Jan. 1 -- the day it is supposed to take effect -- salaries at the plant will be cut almost in half and people will have to work a sixth day a week.
"That's what worries me," he said.
On Sunday morning, Miss Vazquez put on a flowered dress and walked two blocks to Our Lady of Perpetual Help Roman Catholic Church for the 8:30 children's Mass. There the Rev. Cayetano Rosas, a rumpled, chain-smoking priest, told the children that they must have dreams, in spite of the grimness of where and how they live. "Even if the ground is bad," he said, "if the seed is good you can have a good harvest."
 
The Future Is Worrisome
 But in the sacristy after Mass, he confided that he was truly concerned about the future, with or without a trade agreement. "The treaty will affect those with money on this level," he said, reaching high into the air. "Those on the bottom, the people around here, don't even realize what it means."
The church, a circular modern building of whitewashed concrete, was built 10 years ago by the men of the colonia. During the Mass, roosters could be heard crowing outside. A train rumbled past. An old man sitting in a horse-drawn wagon shouted that he had good oranges for sale.
As elsewhere in Mexico, Sunday is a day of family and friends in Hope. After Mass, Miss Vazquez went to her grandmother's tiny house, with just a hint of paint on its often-patched walls. Soon it was filled with people, including her cousin, Cristian David Barajas, who five months ago came from Veracruz, about 700 miles away on the Gulf Coast, to look for work.
Last week he finally found a job in a plastics factory called Nova/Link making toy cars and dolls. He earns $7.80 a day working from 7 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturdays are obligatory and nobody gets paid overtime.
 
Where It's Worse
 "It's hard here but it's worse, much worse, in Veracruz," said Mr. Barajas, also 22. He can survive on that for now because he lives with his grandmother, saving even the $65 a month he might expect to pay in rent here.
While most of the debate on the trade pact has taken place in the United States, Mexicans too are uncertain about what it means. A family friend who had stopped by said he thought a pact would make Mexico, and especially the industrialized northern border region, a beacon for people looking for work, a prospect that makes him worry for his own job.
"People from all over Central America will be coming here," Ramon Lopez Munoz, 31, said. "And you watch. Because there is so much unemployment in the United States, things are going to turn around and it's the Americans who will become wetbacks trying to come here."
Inside the homely cottage at 46 Gomez Palacio, mention of the United States is enough to fire up a debate on culture and values. None of the participants has ever lived on "the other side" or intends to, even though they could walk there and sometimes do, to go shopping.
"Sure, we go to buy Levis, or to look at what clothes they have, but to live? No," Miss Vazquez said. "I don't like it there. The style of life is so closed. People have their air-conditioning and their cars. There's never anybody on the street.
"Besides, if something happened to me here, I know I could go to my mother's house, or my friends'. On the other side, if something happens, you're all alone."
 
Relatives Are at Hand
 Esperanza is her whole world right now. Her mother, her grandmother and her great-grandmother live within a few blocks. The tortilla shop is half a block away. Her mother owns a 12-inch Hitachi television that can pick up channels from Mexico and the United States. They have a radio, two portable fans and a papaya tree in the front yard that yields luscious fruit.
Miss Vazquez said she crossed the border about once a week to shop: things like chicken and eggs tend to be cheaper in Texas, she said. The Gigante supermarket in the center of Matamoros has good prices on some things. For daily shopping, the streets of Esperanza have dozens of small stores attached to the front of houses.
One, on Calle de las Leyes de la Reforma, is run by Julian Rubio Regalado, a melancholy 62-year-old. He opens at 5:30 and doesn't close till well after dark. On a good day, he said, he can clear about $30. Soft drinks, eggs, a small can of prepared food that chases away hunger till the next payday are the regular transactions.
Living within sight of the maquiladoras, Mr. Rubio has never worked inside one. He steered away his six children too, telling them such work was at best only temporary. Today, his children have become teachers and journalists. One makes violins. Three live in Matamoros; three have moved away. All are still in Mexico.
 
The Reality of Life
 Mr. Rubio says he is not sure how getting closer to the United States might help Mexico; he has seen too much to believe that trust between the two countries can just materialize with the signing of an agreement. But for the sake of his children he hopes it will bring more jobs.
For himself, he said, there no longer is much hope. His only plan is to continue working in the store, for as long as he can.
"There's no such thing as a pension here, so that's just the reality of life," he said. But he has his children, and they, not the Government or any complicated trade agreement, will take care of him. That, he said, is the way it has always been in Mexico.
"To have a family is the greatest capital you can have," he said, "and for that I consider myself lucky."

"But I don't think that we are living in poverty. We have food every day, we have the clothes we need, we have lights and water. We may not have everything, but I think we live well." The couple are planning to marry soon. (Photographs by Keith Dannemiller for The New York Times)

Of all the Mexican businesses that would be reshaped by a North American Free Trade Agreement, none is more likely to undergo a transformation than the automotive industry. In that sector, a trade accord may well alter the way cars are made and sold on both sides of the border.
For Mexico, the stakes are high. Cars are its biggest export business after oil, employing 60,000 people directly and more than 300,000 indirectly in parts manufacturing and distribution. Together, the Chrysler Corporation, the Ford Motor Company, the General Motors Corporation, Nissan and Volkswagen built more than a million cars in Mexico last year, making it one of just a few developing countries in the world to reach that mark. 
 Exports grew an average of 142 percent a year from 1985 to 1989, and continue to grow, but at a slower pace. Manufacturing efficiency and quality at some plants rival the best Japanese factories.
 
A Young and Growing Market
 For the United States' car industry, Mexico represents a young and growing market to which it would have privileged access, because the market would still be closed to companies not situated in North America. Although Vice President Al Gore may have overstated the case when he said last week in his debate with Ross Perot that Mexicans would soon be buying a million cars a year, the Mexican car market is growing much faster than the markets in either the United States or Canada.
Moreover, the Big Three already make and sell cars here, and have billions of dollars invested in assembly lines and parts plants. If the trade pact wiped away most of the protectionist restrictions that have hamstrung the way Detroit operates in Mexico, then big changes would follow; possibly including a shift of small-car production to Mexico from South Korea and other Asian countries. Big-car production might then be concentrated in the United States and Canada.
If that happened, the economic analysts said, car prices in Mexico and the United States could drop, each country would become the most efficient producer of the type of car favored by its market, and free trade would give the buyers on both sides of the border wider choices. It should also create more jobs.
The United Automobile Workers union in the United States disagrees and remains actively opposed. Auto workers in Mexico tend to fear the coming competition, but have quietly endorsed the pact.
"This deal is incredibly important to the Mexicans, but it's even more important to the Americans," said James P. Womack, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who advised Mexico during the trade agreement negotiations. "The big loser on this deal basically is Japan, which has been left out in the cold."
The pact would make it difficult for most Japanese manufacturers to set up shop in Mexico, although they are expected to try. Things would be different for Nissan, which has been building cars here since the 1960's. It would share the Big Three's privileged position, with easy access to the American market because its Mexican-made cars would be considered North American in origin, not imports.
The other big car maker in Mexico is Volkswagen, which makes the Beetle, Jetta III and Golf III models in a huge assembly plant in Puebla, about 80 miles southeast of Mexico City. Unlike the others, Volkswagen has no operations in the United States, having closed its assembly plant in Westmoreland, Pa., in the mid-1980's.
Volkswagen has just come through what was probably its worst year since the first hump-backed Beetle was sold here in Mexico in 1954. The year was marked by a bitter strike, a wrenching labor transformation in which VW adopted Japanese-style production methods, and a production and sales debacle in the United States where the company's Jetta III and Golf cars were not available because of labor and production problems.
 
Manufacturing Requirement
 The five foreign auto makers are here because Mexico has long required that if a manufacturer wanted to sell cars here it must make them here. The Big Three were already here, but Nissan opened its plant south of Mexico City in the 1960's. It recently built a $1 billion assembly plant in the central state of Aguascalientes, from which it has started exporting 1,600 station wagons a month to Japan.
In the 1960's, Toyota decided the Mexican market was too small to justify its own plant, but now is one of several companies that have met with officials to discuss their options if a trade pact is signed.
The Mexican Government also restricts the total number of vehicles a manufacturer can import. Today, for example, imports from Chrysler or the other American companies cannot exceed 20 percent of the vehicles they sell in the Mexican market.
A free trade agreement would sweep away most of those rules, at least for companies already here, and would also do away with the current ban on the imports of used cars, which is considered a potentially huge market in Mexico.
 
Better Use of Plants
 A trade deal would allow the Big Three to make better use of their operations in Mexico. Ford, for example, has several plants, including an assembly plant that makes the Ford Escort in Hermosillo, near the border, that is among the most efficient in the world.
Ford also has a plant in Cuautitlan, just outside Mexico City, that is among the least efficient. Unlike most modern plants where just one or two models are produced, Cuautitlan builds all the Cougar, Thunderbird and Grand Marquis models and several lines of trucks sold in Mexico.
Victor M. Barreiro, the president of Ford in Mexico, said if the trade agreement was approved, the Cuautitlan plant would very quickly be redesigned to produced two lines at the most, instead of the current six or seven.
The plan "is to retain for the Mexican market what the Mexican market takes and export the balance," Mr. Barreiro said. "Some are going to say, 'There they go exporting,' but what would I do with the other niches of the market?" in Mexico, he asked. "Import, from the U.S."
 
More Exports Desired
 All the auto companies in Mexico said they wanted to increase exports to the United States, while the Big Three also said they planned to export more cars to Mexico from the United States if a trade agreement was signed.
A study by the United States Department of Commerce projected that with an agreement, the exports to Mexico would increase to more than 60,000 cars, from 1,000, in the first year of the agreement, which would be worth about $1 billion to American auto makers.
Steve Beckman, an international economist with the United Automobile Workers union, called the Commerce Department's projection "possible, but unbelievably unlikely," especially considering that the imports could be matched by Mexican exports.
The union contends that thousands of jobs making radios, wiring and other parts have already been shifted to factories in Mexico from the United States. Mr. Beckman said the constant enticement of Mexico's lower wages -- $1.55 an hour for assemblers in Mexico, compared with $17.38 in the United States -- has already had a dampening effect on salaries in the United States.
 
Worries About Wages
 "Lowering wages is not the way to compete internationally," Mr. Beckman said, "but that's the way Nafta sets the foundation for increasing the profitability of American companies."
Efrain Maldonado is also worried about wages and competition. He has worked at the VW plant in Puebla for 20 years, starting with a job on an assembly line that made vans. Now he is a supervisor, and earns about $1,580 a month. To make ends meet, he and his wife run a curtain shop in Puebla.
He said he thought there were advantages in a free trade agreement that auto workers in Mexico, Canada and the United States would share, but perhaps not at the same time.
"Many of the American companies are going to come here, and there will be more competition," he said. "On the level of technology, we Mexicans can't really compete now, but we've got the advantage of our labor. But the technology will come, and we'll buy more, and in the end there will be jobs all around."

Municipal Advisers Reject Gift Ban

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The National Association of Independent Public Finance Advisers has rejected a ban on political contributions to local officeholders and candidates who could hire them.
Instead, the association adopted a policy that "discourages" its member firms and their employees from making such contributions. In adopting this policy, the association rejected the ban on political contributions that was voluntarily accepted by 17 large Wall Street municipal bond underwriters last month. 
 The association represents independent firms that advise state and local governments and authorities on the underwriting of municipal bonds, working on the other side from the Wall Street and regional firms that underwrite them. While the association rejected the ban, if the firms themselves now decide to stop making political contributions, it would be another step in curbing the role of political contributions in the municipal bond business.
According to the association's president, Robert C. Bendzinski, the association voted over the weekend to stick with a policy initially adopted in September that "discourages its members either as individuals or firms" from making contributions to the state and local officials with whom they do business.
Mr. Bendzinski said the association stuck with this policy because it would apply to all members of these firms. He acknowledged that the association policy was something less than advocating a ban but argued that the association itself could not enforce such a ban.
"I agree that the discouragement does not have the force of an outright ban," said Mr. Bendzinski, who is the president of the Detroit firm of Bendzinski & Company. "But the discouragement does tell that firm and the employees that the association does not want them to do it."
The voluntary ban adopted in October by the 17 Wall Street underwriters will be applied to those who work directly in the municipal bond business and the upper management of the firms. Other members of the firms who are not involved in municipal bonds would be allowed to make contributions under the policies now being drawn up.
The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the self-regulatory board for municipal bond dealers, adopted a final rule last week that prevents firms from doing business with issuers of municipal bonds for two years if the firm or an individual makes a political contribution. But this rule, as it applies to individuals, only covers top management and those in the municipal bond or public finance departments.
The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt Jr., asked the major associations representing people involved in the municipal bond business recently to adopt the principles and ban accepted by the 17 Wall Street firms.
 
Treasury Market
 Prices and yields of Treasury bonds and notes ended yesterday with little change, as many traders and investors began to wonder what the impact of tomorrow's vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement would be on the bond market.
Trading was sluggish. The price of the 30-year bond wound up down just 1/32 as the yield remained unchanged at 6.15 percent. Earlier in the day, the price had been off more than 20/32 as the yield jumped to 6.20 percent.
The most interesting development may have been the fact that Treasury prices did not end the day down in response to positive economic news.
The concern that the economy appears to be picking up its pace has led to a lot of selling recently and pushed the yield on the 30-year bond back up as high as 6.25 percent. The stronger growth has increased worries about a rebound in inflation, although a lot of analysts argue that the economic pickup expected in the fourth quarter will not carry into the first half of next year.
Among yesterday's strong economic reports was a jump of eight-tenths of 1 percent in industrial production, powered by a 6.3 percent rise in motor-vehicle production. The monthly gain was the fifth in a row.
In addition, sales of cars built in North America for the first 10 days of November were at an annual rate of seven million, giving more support to the view that the economy could grow at a pace of 4 percent or higher in the last three months of the year.
In trading yesterday, the prices of shorter-term Treasury securities moved a little higher. The two-year note was up 2/32 as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 4.06 percent, from 4.09 percent on Friday. The price of the three-year note was up 3/32 as the yield fell to 4.41 percent from 4.44 percent.
William V. Sullivan Jr., the director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds, said that the move of some investors and traders into shorter-term maturities yesterday probably was a defensive move ahead of the vote on the trade pact.
Mr. Sullivan said that it appeared to him that the "prevailing opinion" in the market is that the trade pact, known as Nafta, could be defeated. "I don't think anybody knows how the bond market will react to an anti-Nafta vote," he said.
Mr. Sulivan added that there were some who thought the rejection of the trade accord would hurt the bond market. These analysts argue that approval of the trade agreement would open markets and increase competition, which could reduce inflationary pressures.
A defeat of the trade accord, thus, would be a negative for the bond market because it could lead, over the long term, to a rise in inflation.
But others argue that a defeat of the accord might lead to problems with the broader global trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This, in turn, could hamper trade and curb global economic activity, which would lead to slower growth in the United States. If that were the case, a sluggish economy might temper inflationary fears in the short-term and give the bond market a lift.
Following are the results of the Treasury's weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: At 105 Colleges, a Cheaper Federal Student Loan

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Under a pilot program that the Federal Government says will save students and taxpayers money, students at 105 colleges will not have to fill out as much paperwork to get loans next year.
The project, the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, eliminates the middleman -- lenders and guarantor agencies. That means the Department of Education can offer students the lower interest rates available to the Government without the fees that banks now add. 
 And students will have a repayment schedule negotiated to fit their incomes, a plan the Government says will reduce defaults.
It is "one-stop shopping," Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said today. "We are on track to make good on our pledge to save taxpayers $4.3 billion in the course of the next five years."
 
'Going to Help Us All'
 Mr. Riley named 105 colleges and universities that will offer direct loans to almost 300,000 students next year, accounting for 5 percent of the nation's new student loans. The following year, nearly half of the institutions providing Federal student aid will offer direct loans. By 1998, these loans will make up 60 percent of all student lending.
"This is going to help us all," said Kassahun Tefera, a junior at the University of the District of Columbia. "Now it's so confusing with all the papers to fill out."
Under the current Federal Family Education Loan Program, students apply for loans through colleges. Banks provide the money and the Government pays the loan's interest until the student leaves school. If a student defaults, one of 47 guarantor agencies repays the lender and then tries to collect the debt.
 
Reduction in Fees
 The Clinton Administration estimates that direct loans can save $4.3 billion in five years, counting the fees it now pays lenders and fewer defaults. In the 1993 fiscal year, for example, the Government issued 6.1 million loans worth $18 billion; default costs totaled $2.5 billion that year.
The most immediate impact of the plan would be a sharp reduction in the fees that students are charged when they borrow. Under the pilot program, origination and insurance fees, which can now reach 8 percent of a loan, cannot exceed 4 percent.
About 1,100 educational institutions applied for the direct-loan program. About 900 were eligible: They participate in the current loan program, have a default rate lower than 25 percent and can electronically process loan applications or are installing the equipment to do so.
 
72-Hour Decision
 When a student applies for a direct loan, the college will electronically send the application to the Education Department, which will decide within 72 hours whether the student is eligible and send a check.
Despite the Government's enthusiasm, not everyone believes that direct lending is the way to go.
"The current public-private partnership is the best way to serve the interests of students, schools and taxpayers," said Daniel Cheever, president of American Student Assistance, the nation's oldest student loan guarantor. He said the industry was reforming itself, to make applying for and repaying loans simpler.

Dollar Is Strong as Traders Await Vote on Trade Accord

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies in jittery trading yesterday as traders awaited tomorrow's vote by the House of Representatives on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Dealers said some positive American economic reports also supported the dollar. But the focus was clearly on the trade pact. 
 "People caught this up move initially on the thought that Nafta will pass," said Paul Alley, foreign exchange dealer at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. The dollar later wavered because "the stories all day had the vote close one way and then the other," he said.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 106.74 Japanese yen, from 105.65 yen on Friday. It also moved up to 1.6918 German marks, from 1.6845 marks Friday.
Gold prices rose as well, with the December futures contract gaining $2.10, to $375.70 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Most dealers believe a "yes" vote for the trade agreement will help the dollar by improving the Clinton Administration's credibility and paving a smoother path for world trade negotiations.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said he believed the White House was close to having enough votes to pass the trade agreement and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, predicted that lawmakers would approve the treaty by a slim margin.
But David E. Bonior, the Michigan Democrat who is House majority whip, contended that 223 members of the 435-seat House were solidly against the pact.
Nervous traders sold dollars aggressively last week but they were quick to buy them back when the dollar started to firm.
"The market was short dollars and all of the Nafta talk encouraged people to cover positions," said Christopher Wilson, foreign exchange dealer at the Union Bank in Los Angeles.
Reports indicating that " said Christopher Wilson, foreign exchange dealer at the Union Bank in Los Angeles.
Reports indicating that recovery was on track also helped the dollar, dealers said. Industrial production rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in October, and industry operated at 82.4 percent of capacity, the highest rate since August 1990.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4885, down from $1.4937 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Friday's quotes, included: 1.4930 Swiss francs, up from 1.4870; 5.8790 French francs, up from 5.8650; 1,665 Italian lire, up from 1,652, and $1.3197 (Canadian), up from $1.3133 (Canadian).

HEADLINE: Study Says Shelter Turnover Hides Scope of Homelessness

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
The number of New Yorkers who have been homeless in recent years is far greater than experts and advocates previously estimated, according to a new study that for the first time used city records to identify and count individuals in the city's shelter system.
On any given night, there are about 24,000 people in New York City's shelters. But the new study, released yesterday, found that 86,000 different individuals passed through the city's shelter system in 1992 alone. 
 The study, by Dennis P. Culhane, a senior fellow at the Leonard Davis Institute for Health Economics at the University of Pennsylvania, found that 239,425 people, or 3.3 percent of the city's population, had spent some time in the shelters over the last five years. The study also examined city records in Philadelphia and found that nearly 3 percent of its population had endured bouts of homelessness in the same period.
In the past, researchers have generally based their estimates of the homeless population on a snapshot of shelter systems during a certain day or week, missing the turnover.
 
Hints of a Larger Problem
 Such studies have tended to emphasize the needs and problems of the long-term homeless, such as those who are mentally ill or addicted to drugs or alcohol, because on any given night they make up a large proportion of the shelter population.
The new study, however identified a large pool of people who have an episode of homelessness, but then leave a shelter on their own.
Although the researchers did not study the characteristics of this group, Mr. Culhane said the sheer volume of people who became homeless and the similar rates of homelessness in New York and Philadelphia suggest that regional economic problems, not just the behavior of individuals, are a factor. Falling wages and welfare benefits, coupled with rising housing costs, have contributed to homelessness, he said.
Advocates have long contended that government has always dramatically undercounted the number of homeless, but Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said even she was surprised at how many people Mr. Culhane counted. She had estimated that half that number were sheltered in a year.
"I was truly astounded by those numbers," she said. "The Culhane findings underscore the need for affordable housing, income supports and jobs that pay enough to keep a roof over one's head."
Several experts said yesterday that the new study, together with a growing body of research from other cities, states and surveys, shows that homelessness is a far more common experience than previously believed. More than 2 million Americans may become homeless in the course of a year, they said.
Last month, Bruce Link, an associate professor at Columbia University, released the results of a random nationwide telephone survey of 1,507 people that he and his colleagues conducted in 1990. More than 7 percent said they had been homeless at some point in their lives, and 3 percent said they had been homeless in the previous five years -- a finding that was consistent with Mr. Culhane's. Mr. Link said he did not know the margin of error for the survey.
Martha Burt, an expert on homelessness at the Urban Institute in Washington, said Columbus, Ohio; Louisville, Ky., and Massachusetts have also experienced high turnover among the homeless, similar to that of New York and Philadelphia.
Mr. Culhane, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, was able to track the number of people in the shelter systems of New York City and Philadelphia through the cities' computerized records. The new study, done in collaboration with researchers from the city's Human Resources Administration, used Social Security numbers and dates of birth in city shelter records to identify individuals.
 
Children on the Edge
 Besides finding that more people than expected have periods of homelessness, Mr. Culhane also learned that the problem disproportionately affects blacks. From 1988 to 1992, blacks in New York were 16 times more likely to become homeless than whites. And black children were the most likely to become homeless, with 1 in 12 of them spending time in a city shelter.
The children belong to the growing number of families in the city who are living extremely close to the edge financially and periodically slip into homelessness, he said. Mr. Culhane said that the value of the monthly rental subsidy to families on welfare has declined by 42 percent since 1972, while the real cost of housing has risen. There are now close to 300,000 families on welfare in the city.
"There aren't many people who could afford to stay in their homes if you cut their pay in half," he said.
Mr. Culhane also found that homelessness has been worsening among families in New York City, but declining among single individuals. The total number of single people using the system dropped 31 percent from 1988 to 1992, while the number of families rose 32 percent.
The report itself offers no explanation for the diverging trends. Mr. Culhane speculated that some of the individuals may have been jailed or placed in programs for the mentally ill or for people with AIDS. They may also have died of AIDS, he said. City officials have said that more families are entering the system in part because the city has many new shelters that are nicer places to stay, and in part because shelter residents are given priority for subsidized, permanent housing.
In both Philadelphia and New York, Mr. Culhane found that turnover was generally high among the homeless, with many people moving in and out of the shelter system. In New York, 65 percent of families resorted to shelter more than once.
"Where are these people going?" he asked. "That is the big question. It's reasonable to assume many go back to the dangerous or difficult situations from which they came. But we don't really know."
In the report, Mr. Culhane said that the similarity in the proportion of people in Philadelphia and New York to become homeless suggests that homelessness itself "may in fact be reflective of broader regional and national trends, including the declining availability of affordable housing, the decline of wages and welfare benefits against inflation, persistent unemployment and underemployment among young urban adults and the underfunding of community health and mental health programs."
Mr. Culhane and Ms. Burt said the city and the nation should combat homelessness on two levels: by providing social services and special housing help to the smaller number of long-term, mentally ill or addicted homeless people, and by tackling the broader social and economic problems that are fueling the decade-old crisis.
Andrew Cuomo, who designed the city's approach to homelessness under Mayor David N. Dinkins -- an approach embraced warmly by Mr. Giuliani -- agreed with the experts' analysis, but said that government had to focus its limited resources on the neediest of the homeless, those who languish for long, expensive periods in shelters. Millions of poor people need help, he said, but the shelter systems have become a way of helping those who are most desperate.
"Shouldn't we provide services and housing to all 35 million people in poverty? Theoretically, yes," said Mr. Cuomo, who now oversees federal policies on homelessness at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development. "But this is a budget climate where we're spending less money, not more."

HEADLINE: Stocks Retreat as Trade Vote Is Awaited

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks fell somewhat yesterday, as investor concern over the coming trade pact vote this week, the economy, and interest rates slammed the lid shut on any serious rally in the market.
The declining market hit both blue-chip issues and small stocks alike. Investors anxious about the House vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement tomorrow were also taking their cue from the Treasury bond market where interest rates rose early, then recovered toward the end. 
 Bonds fell lower in early trading after United States industrial production data for October and factory-use data showed that interest rates are not likely to fall soon.
 
Investors on the Sidelines
 Concern that a defeat of the trade agreement could mean another blow to a recovering economy moved many investors to the sidelines. Trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday totaled 251 million shares, a bit below average.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.99 points to finish at 3,677.52, while the Nasadaq composite index fell more sharply on a percentage basis, 6.87 points, to 772.45. On the Big Board, the number of losing stocks led gainers by 1,256 to 827.
Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment strategist for the First Albany Corporation, thought the market was adrift. "It's searching for direction and not finding it," he said. "The reason is that not many investors want to take a negative, or for that matter, a positive stand before the Nafta vote on Wednesday. There are worries that either way the vote goes, stocks will go down." He added, "Don't look much for direction from the markets for the first three days of this week."
Some market analysts, who looked to gold as a hedge if the trade accord loses, saw Newmont Mining close at 56 3/4, up 1.
However, a closer look at the the stock market suggets the real damage was in the over-the-counter market and probably more specifically in the technology sector.
Mr. Johnson said technology, computer peripherals and software were weak, showing signs of slowing from the breakneck pace of the last 10 quarters.
For the technology stocks, telecommunications stocks may be overvalued so when investors are faced with a market-sensitive event like the trade vote, it is natural to see investors back away, Mr. Johnson.
Analysts see the United States steel industry a winner if the trade accord passes, according to some industry experts. They believe that with domestic overcapacity, the nation's steel companies should benefit from an expanding steel market in Mexico, with little risk to United States workers worried about jobs moving to Mexico.
Companies with plants closest to the Mexican border would benefit even more, including Texas concerns like Chaparral Steel and the Nucor Corporation, with operations in Arkansas.
Shares of CBS, General Electric, and Capital Cities/ABC were all up sharply on news that a Federal judge has granted permission for the nation's three broadcast television networks to own financial interests in programs.

HEADLINE: Mexican Stocks Reach a High

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 15

 BODY:
Mexican stocks soared to a record high today as investors snapped up shares two days before the United States Congress is set to cast its vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The IPC index of 37 leading shares climbed 14.89 points, or almost three-quarters of a percent, to close at 2,123.33, breaking the high of 2,108.44 set on Nov. 12. 
 "The market continues to be optimistic with regard to the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement," an analyst said. "But today it looked more erratic, perhaps because of the caution of some investors."
Early in the trading session, shares rose to 2,132.20, before falling back as some traders took profits.
Analysts said an announcement of the 1994 Mexican budget and economic targets, generally viewed favorably by the market, also helped the rally. The Government is forecasting a growth rate of 3 percent, after an expected 1.1 percent this year. It also said it expected an inflation rate of 5 percent next year.

HEADLINE: The Free Trade Accord: The Mood;
Americans Split on Free Trade Pact, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

 BODY:
Americans are evenly split over the North American Free Trade Agreement and are uncertain about whether it would create jobs or cost them, a stance that closely mirrors the predicament facing Congress as it prepares to vote on the pact this week, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
The telephone poll, conducted Nov. 11-14 among 1,334 adults nationwide, showed 41 percent opposed and 37 percent in favor of the pact, which would gradually erase trade barriers between the United States, Canada and Mexico. The difference fell within the poll's margin of sampling error, which was plus or minus three percentage points. 
 The national ambivalence is illustrated by the lack of strong opinions about the agreement and evidence that most people shifted their position depending on the information provided by either side in the debate.
If the agreement is described as one that would create jobs in the United States, most of those who opposed it or had no opinion said they would support it, bring the overall support to 85 percent. If the agreement was said to result in a loss of American jobs, an equivalent number of supporters and undecided respondents changed their minds, resulting in overall opposition of 85 percent. .
As a result, the field of battle is fluid and has been left to those with a vested interest in the outcome.
 
Debate Was a Boost
 Public awareness of the debate over the pact has grown, the survey showed. Seventy-two percent of those polled said they had heard something about the trade agreement, and nearly one-third of that group said they had heard a "great deal." But 26 percent said they had heard "not much" about the pact.
The Administration's cause was helped by last week's face-off between Vice President Al Gore and Ross Perot, who debated the agreement in a live television broadcast that 46 percent of the poll respondents said they had watched, at least in part. This could have included subsequent television news coverage.
More than two-thirds of those who watched the broadcast declared Mr. Gore the victor in a sparring match in which the two men seemed to spend almost as much time attacking each other as discussing the merits of the trade agreement.
The Vice President was also viewed favorably by 48 percent of registered voters over all. That is the highest Mr. Gore has been rated since he was chosen to be Bill Clinton's running mate in July 1992.
In addition, the Clinton Administration's decision to take on Mr. Perot appeared to have worked in the short run. Mr. Perot, one of the trade agreement's most vocal opponents, dropped significantly in popularity, with nearly twice as many registered voters saying they view him unfavorably as favorably -- 47 percent to 24 percent. In September, a roughly equal number of respondents viewed him favorably as unfavorably.
Mr. Gore was considered the winner of the debate, by 2 to 1, even among those who opposed the trade pact.
On balance, the national ambivalence over the trade agreement could help the White House, which is engaged in a campaign to convince members of Congress that they will not suffer politically if they vote for the agreement. The White House can argue that the less strongly Americans view the agreement, the less lawmakers need fear retaliation at the ballot box next November if they vote for it.
 
Concept Is Favored
 The largest share of those polled said they generally favored expanding trade with Mexico and thought that establishing a "North American free trade zone" would be "mostly good" for the United States.
And 67 percent said that buying and selling products through trade with other countries "is good for the U.S. economy," suggesting strong support for the President's arguments against economic isolationism.
The White House has emphasized the Nobel Prize winners, economists and former Presidents who support the trade agreement, while opponents have denounced it as a plan that would endanger the livelihood of workers.
As a result, support for the accord has broken down along lines of social class rather than on the traditional party divisions that typically define policy debates. College graduates, people with annual household incomes above of $75,000 and those who were optimistic about the economy typically support the agreement.
But those with a high school diploma or less, adults under 30, blue-collar workers and those with union members in their households as well as those who were pessimistic about the economy typically oppose it.
And although many black members of Congress and black leaders like the Rev. Jesse Jackson oppose the trade agreement, the poll found no clear division along racial lines.
 
Confusion on the Impact
 More than two-thirds of Americans now know that Mr. Clinton, who has appeared in advertisements and delivered speeches on behalf of the agreement, supports the trade agreement. But more than two-thirds also said they did not know whether the lawmaker who represents them in Congress was for or against it. And there was no evidence of partisan division on the accord. Democrats and Republicans split evenly in their support.
Unlike other issues like health care, the economy and taxes, opinions about the trade agreement are not rooted in personal interest for most Americans, the poll found, and the merits of the pact stir little emotion. Only 1 person in 6 said his or her household would be economically affected by the agreement. Fewer still said they would cast a vote for or against an elected representative solely because of the lawmaker's vote on the accord.
These findings suggest that opponents and proponents of the pact may find it hard to deliver on threats to defeat legislators who defy them.
 
No Strong Sentiments Absent
 The absence of strong public sentiment also confirms Mr. Clinton's strategy to sway votes by appealing directlyto individual legislators rather than to their constituents. In addition, it may give an advantage to organized groups that support and raise money for members of Congress.
Many legislators are also being guided by the pulse-taking they have been conducting in their home districts rather than by the results of national polls that fail to account for regional concerns. Lawmakers from the industrial Midwest, for example, are more opposed to the trade agreement than are those who represent states that border Mexico and could therefore gain an immediate economic benefit from an increased international flow of goods.
The results of the poll indicate that neither side in the trade-agreement debate has been fully successful in making a clear case to the public.
The most significant evidence of this was the shift in public opinion that occurred when respondents were asked whether the pact would "increase or decrease the number of jobs available in the United States."
Although the largest share of those polled, 34 percent, said the accord would probably cost jobs, that tally was a decline from the 49 percent who felt the same way in September. Instead, 30 percent of the respondents volunteered the opinion that the number of jobs would probably stay the same; only 4 percent offered that view in September.
This represents a significant blow to organized labor, which has argued that the agreement would cost jobs and has devoted much of its advertising effort to driving home that point. In addition, the poll indicates that Americans may now be more sympathetic to the claims of business interests than to the concerns of organized labor.
There are also other underlying signs of uncertainty for opponents of the trade accord, who have spent millions of dollars to try to convince the public that the agreement presents a fundamental threat to the economic security of American workers.
When asked whether they would "side with business" or with labor in a dispute between the two, 44 percent said that without knowing any of the details of the dispute their first instinct would be to side with business. Thirty-four percent said they would side with the unions.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: The Overview;
SUPPORTERS ASSERT MAJORITY IN HOUSE BACKS TRADE PACT

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 15

 BODY:
After a day of deal-cutting, arm-twisting and speech-making, supporters of the North American Free Trade Agreement said today that they had won commitments from enough representatives to give them a victory when the House votes on Wednesday.
Although neither side had a majority publicly committed to its cause, and the balance hung with about two dozen representatives whose positions were not announced, a senior White House official said that a narrow victory was at hand because enough uncommitted legislators had agreed to support the President if their votes were essential.
 
Feeling More Confident
 "It's just a question of who're going to be the ones to vote the hard votes," said the White House official. "I feel more confident than I've felt in a long time." 
 President Clinton, dropping in unexpectedly as Administration officials were briefing journalists at the end of the day, predicted a narrow victory.
"We're going to get it," he said. Then, joking about the razor-thin margins by which he won budget votes last summer, he added, "It's going to be another landslide in paradise."
As each side's nose-counters toiled in the background, Mr. Clinton continued his dispute with the labor unions that make up his party's bedrock. Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said Mr. Clinton "clearly abdicated his role as leader of the Democratic Party," by assuring Republicans last week that he would try to prevent Democrats from using pro-agreement votes against them. [Page B10.]
 
White House Promises
 Several of the undecided lawmakers said today that they were now leaning toward voting for the trade pact after Administration trade officials pledged to protect their rural constituents from foreign farm competition. Administration officials told the lawmakers they would limit Canadian shipments of wheat and peanut butter that compete with American products.
Two undecided Democrats whose constituents grow wheat and peanuts, Representative Glenn English of Oklahoma and Representative Bill Sarpalius of Texas, said they were leaning toward support for the pact because of the two arrangements.
Representative Romano L. Mazzoli, a Kentucky Democrat who announced his support for the agreement today, said that the arm-twisting had been remarkable and had included calls from Mr. Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, a dozen other top Administration officials and various labor leaders. "I've been around for 23 years, and I'll be honest with you, there've been some legislative full court presses I've seen, but I don't remember anything like this," he said.
Opponents continued to insist today, as they have for weeks, that they had enough votes to defeat the trade measure. In fact, several representatives announced for the first time that they would vote against it.
Among them was Representative Robert G. Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat who heads the Foreign Affairs Committee's panel on Western Hemisphere affairs. Citing Mexico's shortcomings as a democracy, Mr. Torricelli became the first prominent member of Congress to say he would vote against the pact for foreign policy reasons.
 
9 Meetings for Clinton
 The President held nine meetings today with undecided House members, and told a group of small-business owners here that labor's central argument -- that the pact would cost Americans jobs -- was wrong. The accord, Mr. Clinton said, would instead create jobs by eliminating tariffs. "There is no way any wealthy country in this world can increase jobs and incomes without increasing the number of people who buy that nation's products and services," he said.
His opponents in the House Democratic leadership, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, and David E. Bonior of Michigan, the majority whip, countered by telling 40 busloads of union members on the steps of the Capitol this afternoon that the pact would result in lower wages and fewer jobs here as free trade lured American factories to Mexico.
Both sides have raised the political stakes in the vote, with Mr. Clinton asserting a defeat would damage his ability to conduct international affairs while opponents have warned of economic catastrophe if the agreement is approved. The debate over the deal has reduced a 15-pound package of detailed rules governing millions of commercial transactions into a competition of rallies and slogans.
Opponents held rallies today in Tennessee and Indiana, and fewer than 100 auto workers demonstrated near the General Motors factory in Linden, N.J. The auto industry strongly supports the agreement because it opens the Mexican market to American cars and because Detroit increasingly relies on Mexico for auto parts. But auto workers fear that more factories would be moved south.
Ross Perot, who has campaigned against the pact, showed up outside the Capitol and called for a Federal investigation of "billions of dollars" in projects that he said Mr. Clinton had offered lawmakers Sunday for their votes. He would not provide examples.
 
Pivotal Delegation
 Supporters also continued to plead their case, in television commercials and speeches by Administration officials. The White House released a list this evening of 54 representatives it said had committed themselves to vote for the pact since the debate last Tuesday between Mr. Perot and Mr. Gore.
Administration officials stepped up their lobbying of the pivotal Florida delegation, which is scheduled to meet on Tuesday morning to reconsider its opposition to the pact. The Administration has quietly promised to protect Florida crops against European, Asian and Latin American competition in trade talks now underway among 116 nations, reversing a commitment to keep the pact separate from the world talks. The concession to the Florida growers is certain to anger other nations in the talks.
Representative Thomas H. Andrews, a Maine Democrat and long-time ally of organized labor, announced that he would vote against the pact but also said that he would no longer accept political contributions from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Mr. Andrews said he was concerned about the appearance of improper influence and angry at some Maine union officials who he said had threatened to withhold money if he voted for the pact.
"I will not be bought, I don't take well to being threatened and this cheapens the entire process," he said. According to Common Cause, a Washington research group, Mr. Andrews has been a major recipient of labor money in recent elections.
Tensions are high, and tempers are beginning to flare. Representative Michael J. Kopetski, an Oregon Democrat who plans to vote for the agreement, complained that unions in his district were circulating literature saying that his vote had been bought.
"I don't mind criticism," Mr. Kopetski said in an interview. "But when they say I'm for sale, I think they're crossing the line, and I resent it."
One of the leading vote-counters in the group of supporters, Jim Kolbe, a Republican from Arizona, said he thought the trade vote would follow the pattern of the one on the budget in August. Then, Mr. Kolbe recalled, neither side knew who would win when the voting began, but the Administration had enough votes in reserve to prevail by a one-vote margin.

HEADLINE: Japanese Tax Policy Enmeshed in Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 15

 BODY:
When Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets President Clinton in Seattle later this week, he will bring an array of "omiyage," or gifts, including a vague plan for deregulating Japan's coddled economy and a proposal for opening the public works business to foreign construction companies.
But it appears unlikely that he will bring the one thing the United States and some private economists have said would do the most to reduce Japan's soaring trade surplus now -- a package of tax cuts to persuade recession-battered Japanese consumers to begin spending again. 
 The United States has been working to reduce Japan's surpluses -- expected to come to a record $150 billion this year -- for more than a decade, so no one believes there is a cure-all. But many experts agree one of the surest means of commencing a sustained reduction and easing some of the political strains between Tokyo and Washington would be to jump- start the stalled Japanese economy. That would attract more imports and make manufacturers less eager to export their way to profitability.
The last two years, successive Governments have announced huge increases in public works amounting to more than $280 billion to pump a fresh flow of money into the becalmed business sector. Official interest rates have also been squeezed down to the lowest levels since World War II. Neither step has produced much improvement, however, with the economy actually expected to shrink this year. Thus, many economists in both countries say a big tax cut is essential. It would put money directly in the hands of taxpayers and improve stubbornly morose consumer sentiment, the economists say.
On Friday, hours before Mr. Hosokawa boards a jet for Seattle, he is to receive the results of a study by a tax commission that will address this critical issue.
While hopes have been high in Washington, leaks to newspapers and comments by some Government officials suggest the commission is unlikely to give the Clinton Administration what it wants -- unless Mr. Hosokawa, a conservative reformer, makes an uncharacteristically bold political decision at the last minute.
And that seems unlikely because the diverse coalition Government Mr. Hosokawa heads is badly split over a tax cut, with the Prime Minister's conservative supporters staunchly opposed on the ground that such a step would burden the country with big deficits.
The report is expected to provide broad policy proposals, not specific figures. The numbers will be filled in by the Government.
But there is speculation that the Government will eventually reduce certain income taxes by about 5 trillion yen, or $47 billion, but then take most of that away by raising a year or so later the consumption tax, a kind of national sales tax. The two, in other words, would just about wash each other out.
"The sort of tax cut they are discussing is not sufficient to stimulate a business recovery," said Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist for the Nomura Research Institute. "The situation would be really miserable if there is no tax cut at all. But if they reduce income taxes and announce in advance that they will be increasing the consumption tax after a year or two, people will just discount this and the economy will continue to decline."
Bolstering those who advocate a tax cut is the fact that the income tax burden borne by working Japanese has been rising sharply in recent years, eating into consumption.
Jesper Koll, the economist here with S. G. Warburg Securities, said income taxes paid by individuals have increased an average 5.4 percent a year since 1989, as taxpayers edged into higher brackets. That has outstripped the 4.3 percent average annual increase in household incomes.
 
Letter From Clinton
 The sensitivity to the tax issue here was apparent last week when a newspaper reported that President Clinton had written a letter to Mr. Hosokawa demanding a tax cut of more than 6 trillion yen and a delay of any increase in the 3 percent consumption tax until the economy is growing by at least 2 percent.
Mr. Hosokawa acknowledged he had received a letter and that the two leaders would discuss taxes at a gathering of the leaders of Asia-Pacific countries. But Mr. Hosokawa denied the letter had contained any specific demands, which American officials confirm. Other American officials have laid out, however, the sort of stimulus they think Japan needs to deliver.
Resistance to a big tax reduction appears strong, however. Hiroshi Miyajima, an economist at Tokyo University and member of the tax commission, laid out the group's thinking in a recent newspaper interview.
"I believe there is little ground for carrying out drastic income tax cuts," he said.
He explained that with the "graying" of Japan's population, as the baby-boom generation ages and retires, increases in the consumption tax rate were "inevitable" to cover the growing demand for social security payments.
Indeed, Finance Ministry bureaucrats cling to the view that a straight income tax cut would be reckless. They argue that with the budget already in deficit and the Government's total debt burden relatively high, Japan will be unable to provide the Government pensions and social security payments of the growing numbers of elderly Japanese if some taxes are not raised.
 
Disputed by Washington
 Washington takes a different view. Japan's outstanding Government debt is about the same as that of the United States relative to the size of their economies. But, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the great majority of Japan's debt is owned by Government-controlled institutions. Thus Japan's net debt, or the amount held by non-Government investors, is about one-tenth that of the United States.
That, American economists argue, gives the Japanese more than enough room to cut taxes and produce a temporary budget deficit to generate fresh growth. That tactic was first articulated by the British economist John Maynard Keynes.
"The Government's agenda has been set by the Ministry of Finance, and they are not interested in a Keynesian stimulus, just some restructuring of the tax system," Mr. Koll said. "The Ministry of Finance still believes that at all costs deficit spending should be avoided as an evil. And that's that."

HEADLINE: Strange Oases In Sea Depths Offer Map To Riches

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
HUGE rock chimneys that spew hot water into the ocean abyss and nourish a riot of bizarre creatures are also fostering a wide range of economic spinoffs, leading some experts to call them the next great prize in the global race for natural resources.
These oases of heat and life in the frigid depths of the ocean were first discovered 15 years ago and have since been found along many of the volcanic gashes that gird the earth. Up to 15 stories high, the chimneys form as cold waters trickle through sea-floor fractures, soak up heat, leach out minerals, percolate upward and shed the minerals in solid deposits as the now superheated fluid mixes back into icy sea water. 
 Profits are already accruing from the exotic microbes that dwell in and around the rocky monoliths. These heat-loving bacteria are extraordinary in that some of them can survive water as hot as 700 degrees Fahrenheit. Such stamina makes them a gold mine for biotechnology companies, which are isolating, cloning and selling their extremely heat-stable enzymes for use in genetic engineering.
Scientists say such tools are likely to give biotechnology and other industries a major lift.
"We're like kids in a candy shop," said Dr. John A. Baross, a microbiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who collects and studies the heat-loving microbes, which are known as hyperthermophiles.
"With biotechnology, we're just scratching the surface," he said. "The food and pharmaceutical industries are also starting to get into it, particularly with enzymes that modify sugars. These organisms have the potential to do lots of remarkable things, such as degrading toxic wastes. All sorts of breakthroughs are possible."
A different spinoff is mineral wealth. The chimneys and their environs turn out to be laced with rare metals like zinc, copper, silver and gold, which together are worth untold billions of dollars. Although commercial mining is far in the future, given the cold, darkness and crushing pressure of the deep, these deposits are now being carefully assayed by countries like Japan, Germany, Canada and the United States.
Even more important, the new understanding of the process by which metals are concentrated in the deep has become an analytical map to mineral wealth on land, with prospectors around the globe now hunting for slices of what ages ago was sea floor.
Experts say the abyss turns out to be riddled with mineral, biological and intellectual riches and will probably divulge more surprises in the decades ahead.
"The deep ocean has important resource implications that we're only beginning to understand," said Dr. Peter A. Rona, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who has written widely on the subject.
The alien world of deep-sea hot springs and their odd forms of life was first uncovered in 1977 by American scientists diving in the ocean depths off the Galapagos Islands. The site was part of a 40,000-mile-long chain of volcanic fissures that gird the earth like seams on a baseball, actively creating new crust in periodic outbursts. The scientists discovered a subtle byproduct of that process -- the hot springs.
The otherworldly animals found in this environment included giant tube worms and clams. When brought to the surface, the creatures smelled of rotten eggs, a sign of sulfur. It turned out that their primary source of energy was not sunlight, the basis of photosynthesis, but sulfur compounds emitted by the hot vents, in particular hydrogen sulfide. The new animals thrived on substances that most others found poisonous.
The mining potential of such sites emerged quickly. In 1979, American scientists exploring the ocean off the west coast of Mexico found towering rock chimneys spewing extraordinarily hot water that was black with minerals, dubbed black smokers. The chimneys turned out to be made of a mix of metals known as polymetallic sulfides.
Such blends are one of the most common types of mineral deposits on land, typically including iron, copper, zinc and sometimes commercially significant amounts of silver and gold. These deposits have been mined by humans for centuries.
In the sea floor, the process at work is thought to be fairly straightforward. Volcanic heat acts as a furnace to concentrate metals found in small amounts throughout the crust and the sea water itself. For instance, every cubic mile of sea water is estimated to hold 38 pounds of gold. As the hot water flows through the subsurface cracks, it becomes very acid and leaches rare minerals out of the crust as it flows upward.
Some of the minerals can precipitate out beneath the sea floor as they encounter cool water in porous rock, forming diffuse deposits of expanding mineralization, while others precipitate at the surface in icy sea water to form well-defined chimneys.
In 1981, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration exploring near the Galapagos found chimneys atop an ore body they estimated to hold 25 million tons of sulfides, according to "Fire Under the Sea" (William Morrow & Company), a book on undersea hot springs by Joseph Cone. The value of the copper alone in this deposit was estimated at $2 billion.
Such figures caught the eye of the Reagan Administration, which was told the Gorda sea-floor spreading center just off the coast of California and Oregon was probably laced with similar kinds of riches.
On March 10, 1983, in a terse, 532-word proclamation that received little public notice, President Ronald Reagan more than doubled the size of the United States, claiming sovereignty over waters extending 200 nautical miles (or 230 statute miles) from the nation's territories and possessions. This expansion of sovereign rights, he said, would "advance the development of ocean resources."
A bevy of Federal agencies soon embarked on mapping and exploration. Samples of polymetallic sulfides recovered from the Gorda ridge were found to contain copper, zinc, lead, cobalt and silver, but in amounts ultimately judged unattractive for mining in this century.
Gold was later discovered just outside American territorial waters on the Juan de Fuca ridge off Oregon, and along the volcanic spreading center that runs down the middle of the North Atlantic. At 23 parts per million, the concentrations there are 2,000 times greater than the average in the earth's crust and many times higher than what is routinely mined on land.
The Federal Government is continuing to assess the potential of such deposits through submarine dives, robot reconnaissance and deep-ocean drilling from ships.
Dr. Rona of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration cautioned that the possibility of mining deep-sea gold raised difficult issues that pushed its likely accomplishment well into the future.
"It's not just the cold and depth and darkness," he said in an interview. "The challenges are also economic, environmental and legal."
For instance, the United Nations is moving to regulate mining on the high seas, and if such a venture is ever undertaken, the costs could be very high. "We're talking hundreds of millions to billions of dollars to get operations like this going," Dr. Rona said.
The biggest payoff to date, mining experts agree, is that the discovery of deep-sea gold and polymetallic sulfides has become a guide to prospecting on land. The hunt is now on for ancient sea floors once thick with smoking chimneys that over the ages were pushed up onto land to become part of the continents. Some of these deposits have already been mined over the ages, though in ignorance of their origins.
"The lessons we learn from the modern sea floor can be applied to the same geological situation back through time," said Dr. Ian R. Jonasson, an economic geologist with the Geological Survey of Canada, in Ottawa. "It's a way of stripping away the rust of time to see the primary ore-forming processes."
Such insights, Dr. Jonasson added, were already paying off handsomely enough on land to help postpone the day when the sea floor itself might be mined. He also noted that some terrestrial mines were starting to yield fossils of creatures similar to those now found around active chimneys on the sea floor.
Any delays in the onset of mining are a good thing in the eyes of deep-sea ecologists and biologists, who prize the rich diversity of hot-spring creatures and fear that deep dredging could cause their extinction.
As early as 1987, life scientists were calling for some of these abysses to be declared biological preserves so the strange organisms could be studied for such things as biotechnology. In particular, scientists were intrigued by legions of bacteria that dwelled not only inside the creatures surrounding the chimneys but in the hot fluids themselves, some of them feasting off the sulfur compounds.
In 1988, a microbe of the Pyrococcus genus was isolated from a hot vent more than a mile deep in the Gulf of California. Unlike terrestrial bacteria, it could be grown, and its body chemistry could operate, at temperatures above the boiling point, which at sea level is 212 degrees. Instead, the microbe grew at temperatures of up to 220 degrees, and could withstand much higher ones.
New England Biolabs Inc., of Beverly, Mass., took the microbe, isolated from it an important enzyme that manipulates tiny bits of genetic material known as DNA, cloned that enzyme in large amounts and then sold it, beginning in December 1991. It was apparently the first time part of a deep-sea bacterium had been brought to market. The enzyme is DNA polymerase and its trade name is Deep Vent.
The enzyme can speed the polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., which has spawned a branch of biotechnology that allows scientists to rapidly make trillions of copies of vanishingly small amounts of DNA, including the DNA in fingerprints left at crime scenes. In the popular film "Jurassic Park," researchers used the technique to recreate dinosaurs.
The advantages of the new enzymes are many. They are extremely stable at the high temperatures of biochemistry, unlike many conventional enzymes that break down relatively quickly and have to be replaced. Perhaps most importantly, they allow genetic chemistry to be conducted in boiling fluids, a step that automatically kills off most terrestrial bacteria and helps insure that batches of genetic chemicals are pure. Contamination by foreign DNA is a major problem and source of error in P.C.R. work.
Other companies are racing to dissect such microbes and bring their unique enzymes to market. Stratagene, with offices in La Jolla, Calif., has cloned deep bacteria from the Juan de Fuca ridge and is searching for others.
"It's a growing area with lots of potential," said Dr. Eric J. Mathur, director of the company's high-temperature laboratory.
The United States Biochemical. Corporation, in Cleveland, is working with the University of Maryland's Center of Marine Biotechnology, in Baltimore, to gather new organisms from the deep. It just won a Federal grant from the Commerce Department to speed its enzyme work.
"The field is untapped," said Vincent Kazmer, a senior vice president at United States Biochemical. "The annual enzyme market might be $600 million. Just think about replacing chemical catalysts with these kinds of enzymes. There you start talking billions."
He added: "Let's be realistic. This is science today and it's future depends on what we find, and how well some things can be cloned and what their activities are like."
Dr. Holger W. Jannasch, a microbiologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod, Mass., which plays a central role in locating new bacteria with its deep-diving submarine Alvin, said that perhaps 10 percent of the existing hyperthermophiles had been found.
"Every time we go to sea, we isolate new ones," he said. "We get surprises all the time. The biology and biophysics of these organisms is completely different, which is very exciting."
Commercially, Dr. Jannasch added, the hyperthermophile field is "already a big deal." He said it was a big source of income for biotechnology companies. He estimated that more than a dozen companies around the world were scrutinizing or exploiting the new area.
An Alvin voyage last month to a previously unstudied part of the Juan de Fuca ridge found more than a dozen different types of microbes in hot vents more than a mile deep, all of which appear to be new to science.
"Historically, every time we've isolated a hyperthermophile, it's been a new species," said James F. Holden, a biological oceanographer at the University of Washington who was on the voyage and is identifying the new bacteria. "This field is explosive."

HEADLINE: New Test of Broadway Alliance Arrives With 'Any Given Day'

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The advertising for "Any Given Day," the Frank D. Gilroy play that is to open on Broadway tonight, does not hesitate to trumpet that its star, Sada Thompson, has won a Tony Award, that Mr. Gilroy won the Pulitzer Prize for his long-running hit "The Subject Was Roses" and that the production is a world premiere that, unlike most Broadway shows these days, did not originate in London or Dublin or Los Angeles.
Nowhere does the advertising mention that "Any Given Day" is being produced at the Longacre Theater under the provisions of the Broadway Alliance, the three-year-old coalition of Broadway producers, theater owners, craft guilds and unions that was created to encourage more serious plays, fill darkened theaters and lure new audiences by reducing theater costs and ticket prices. 
 Small wonder. Of the four alliance plays previously produced, not one has made a penny. The first three -- "The Speed of Darkness," "Our Country's Good" and "Crazy He Calls Me" -- were flops. The fourth, "Mixed Emotions," a comedy by Richard Baer now playing at the Golden Theater, received unenthusiastic reviews but, because of low weekly costs, has stayed open with grosses that are a third of the theater's earning potential.
"I'm afraid that the name of the alliance leads to the perception that this is bargain-basement theater, even though that's not true," said Edgar Lansbury, the producer of "Any Given Day." "We decided that ballyhooing the alliance connection was not a very good idea."
 
'Boneheaded Idea'
 Frederick Zollo, who was one of the producers of "Our Country's Good," offered an even stronger assessment of the alliance, calling it "a boneheaded idea that will never be a success."
"The low ticket price gave the public the idea that they were getting damaged goods and all the alliance limitations were killing us," said Mr. Zollo, who is currently a producer of "Angels in America."
The ground rules for alliance plays have changed since Mr. Zollo's experience with "Our Country's Good" in 1991, however, and partisans of the agreement say they still believe it can work. Under the alliance's original terms, plays had to be produced for no more than $400,000. Royalties, many salaries and other costs for Broadway Alliance plays were to be cut by an average of at least 25 percent (actors, for example, could earn no more than $2,500 a week and no less than $713 a week), and the maximum ticket price was to be $24. The provisions were originally restricted to three of Broadway's often unoccupied theaters, the Belasco, the Nederlander and the Walter Kerr.
Last January, after complaints that the alliance rules were limiting the enthusiasm of producers, the number of participating theaters was expanded to 11, the limit on capitalization was raised to $650,000 and the top ticket price was increased to $35. (The most expensive ticket for a single straight play on Broadway now is $60, for "Angels in America.")
 
The Sam Shepard Card

 
 After making the changes, the alliance prepared for a deluge of projects from producers, which never came. Nevertheless, the alliance's advocates are buoyed not only by "Any Given Day," but also by "Simpatico," a new Sam Shepard work that is to be produced at the Cort Theater in late January, most likely under the alliance's provisions, with a cast that is to include Ed Harris, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Frederick Forrest and James Gammon.
"Producers can make a lot of money under the alliance," said Rocco Landesman, the president of Jujamcyn Theaters. "The advantage to a producer is that the cost structure is kept down, yet your gross potential is great, almost as good as it would be for a Broadway play not produced under the alliance."
This was what attracted Mr. Lansbury for "Any Given Day," a tragicomic drama about a family living in the Bronx during the 1940's. He ruled out a Broadway production under conventional contracts "because it would have cost in excess of $1 million, and it's hard to raise that much money for a straight play in the current theater environment."
With its large nine-character cast, he said, the play needed a 500-seat theater to be economically viable. "We knew the show would cost a half-million Off Broadway," Mr. Lansbury said. "The alliance production will cost $650,000. I don't think there is much difference between the Broadway and Off Broadway audience for a play by Frank Gilroy. If people want to come, they'll go anywhere to see it."
 
Larger House's Attractions

 
 Ultimately he and Mr. Gilroy decided on an alliance production because "Broadway offered the prospect of a larger house, so the possibility of recoupment and potential profit were much greater," Mr. Lansbury explained. The Longacre has 1,096 seats, more than twice as many as most Off Broadway houses.
More important, under the alliance the show could run more cheaply from week to week. "We can break even at slightly more than 40 percent of capacity," he said, alluding to a weekly nut of $85,000 to $95,000. The break-even point, he said, would be 25 percent to 35 percent higher under a standard Broadway contract.
"Off Broadway, the capitalization would be less, true," he said. "But also the potential for profit would be less." In addition, a Broadway location "would bring in some of the out-of-towners that you might not get in an Off Broadway venue."
The promise of low initial and operating costs was also the reason for plans to bring in the new Shepard play under the auspices of the alliance, because a production of "Simpatico" would cost $1 million under conventional Broadway rules and $650,000 under the alliance would be a lot easier to raise.
"Some of the cast is available for only a limited time," said Lewis Allen, the lead producer for "Simpatico," "and the possibilities for profit are limited Off Broadway if you have a restricted time." For this reason, he said, an alliance production in the 1,084-seat Cort might be preferable to one in an Off Broadway house.
He added, referring to Mr. Shepard: "Sam is not the darling of the traditional Broadway audience, so we're hoping to get an Off Broadway audience on Broadway. We can charge $20 or less for the balcony seats."
 
Disappointment in Audiences

 
 Other theater people are surprised that audiences have not responded to the opportunity to see live theater at a low price. "You can argue that the plays aren't as good as they should have been, but I think the audiences have let us down," said Alan Eisenberg, the executive director of Actors' Equity, who was the Broadway Alliance's first chairman. "I'm disappointed that audiences haven't given more support to these shows."
Some theater people have suggested that the alliance must exert more quality control. "But many people don't realize that the alliance doesn't make any artistic judgments," said David S. Rosenak, the executive director of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, who was the chairman of the alliance last year. "We facilitate. We judge the budget and make sure it conforms to the alliance guidelines."
The alliance is administered by a 24-person committee composed of producers, theater owners, officials of theatrical unions and representatives from the League of American Theaters and Producers, which picks up the alliance's administrative expenses.
But Bob McDonald, the business manager of Local 1, the stagehands' union, who is now the chairman of the alliance, said he did not favor a committee that would make esthetic judgments about potential alliance shows. "Who are we to exercise criticism, or try to control the content of these plays?" he asked. "No one knows what will, or will not be, a success. It's a roll of the dice."
 
Lack of Good Plays?

 
 Mr. Lansbury said he believed that the alliance hadn't received more good plays because "there aren't that many plays on the open market." The most eagerly sought playwrights have connections with institutional theaters, he said, "and producers have just become a bunch of movers, moving institutional productions to commercial theaters."
Others favor modifying the alliance rules to give producers more incentives to bring in new works. Gerald Schoenfeld, the chairman of the Shubert Organization, said that the producers of an alliance play that becomes a hit should be allowed to switch it to a potentially more lucrative full Broadway contract, raising ticket prices to standard Broadway levels.
"The idea," Mr. Schoenfeld said, "is to get shows into theaters, and if they are successful, then standard contract terms should be invoked. I don't think the present alliance terms offer enough of an inducement to the producers, the actors, to everybody."
Mr. McDonald opposes this suggestion as well. "How can you tell the public you're charging them a maximum of $35 per ticket and then increase the price?" he asked. "I don't think changing that is in the cards."
Mr. Eisenberg added that such a move would give alliance shows an unfair competitive advantage against other shows that had to assume higher weekly operating costs from the beginning of their run, when a show is trying to build an audience.
 
Work and Awards

 
 Despite the alliance's sad track record, its defenders point to the fact that since 1991, the productions have provided about 40 weeks' worth of employment to actors and backstage crews, and have won eight Tony nominations. These accomplishments were achieved, however, at a total loss to the shows' backers.
"The time to applaud the alliance," Mr. Lansbury said, "is when it has a show that runs two years and returns its capitalization: when it has a real hit."

HEADLINE: Battle Looms Over U.S. Policy On Species

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
A NASTY fight is shaping up over the future of the Endangered Species Act, and it pits two cherished American values, private property rights and the preservation of nature, against each other.
Flashes of lightning from the approaching political storm have been abundant of late, even though action to reauthorize the expiring law is unlikely to come before well into next year at the earliest. The property-rights advocates, who see efforts to conserve endangered species as a restriction on free use of land and a brake on economic development, have found allies in Congress. Late last month, they served clear notice of the campaign they are preparing to wage. 
 "I hope we have laid the gauntlet down," Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Democrat who defends property rights, told the House then. Although he and others had just lost a round in Congress, Mr. Tauzin vowed that it was merely a skirmish in "what will be a real war in this chamber over what kind of balance we want to strike between environmental protection and the protection of human beings on their property."
Last month's defeated proposal would have required financial compensation for landowners whose economic use of property is restricted as a result of whatever imperiled species might be found on it by a newly organized National Biological Survey.
Mr. Tauzin is also the chief sponsor of a proposed revision of the Endangered Species Act, which would require the Government to compensate any landowner whose property drops substantially in value as a result of the act's provisions. Environmentalists and their Federal supporters say Mr. Tauzin's true purpose in backing the proposal is to seriously weaken the law by discouraging the Government from enforcing it aggressively.
Environmentalists contend that the property-rights advocates have exaggerated the extent to which property values are harmed because of the Endangered Species Act. "Undoubtedly, some landowners in some places have experienced diminished value," said Michael Bean of the Environmental Defense Fund. "I don't think it's widespread."
In any event, conservationists and their political allies say, the principle of restricting property rights on behalf of the public good is deeply enshrined in American law, and they argue that complaints should be adjudicated by the courts, where few if any claims have so far been filed.
 
Call to Strengthen Law
 Rather than being weakened, some environmentalists say, the Endangered Species act needs to be strengthened. The case for a stronger effort gained some support last week with the publication of a study thatfound that recovery plans drawn up under the act for some endangered species had set goals at or below existing populations of the species. These inadequate goals "risk extinction rather than insure survival," the authors wrote in the journal Science, and they suggested that political, social and economic pressures were responsible.
"Our conclusion is that the Endangered Species Act is an extremely valuable tool, but that it's simply being overwhelmed," said Dr. J. Michael Scott, a research biologist with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service at the University of Idaho. He was an author of the study, along with Timothy J. Tear and Patricia Hayward of the University of Idaho and Dr. Brad Griffith of the Fish and Wildlife Service.
Advances in the theory and practice of conservation may offer a means of strengthening the nation's efforts while at the same time coming to a compromise with property rights. Conservation strategies and tactics have moved well beyond what they were when the Endangered Species Act was passed 20 years ago.
Then conservationists focused on single endangered species, one at a time. Today, conservationists say, although the species-by-species approach has probably prevented the extinction of many species, it amounts to last-resort emergency-room care. What is called for now, according to the emerging conventional wisdom, is preventive medicine: seeing to it that large enough slices of ecosystems, containing multiple species, are protected before species populations become so small as to become imperiled.
"What you need," Dr. Scott said, "is a way to cut off the pipeline to the Endangered Species Act; that is, save species while they're still common. A lot of the species now on the endangered list were common 25 or 30 years ago. It would have been easier to sit down then with all parties and make decisions on a rational basis. You'd not be dealing with the last 1,000 hectares of habitat. At that point it's a motherhood issue for people on both sides, and with those types of issues there's very little give. The number of options is severely limited."
The new view among experts is that earlier intervention provides more leeway to work out compromises between conservationists and landowners, which preserve both wild species and the value of private property while avoiding confrontations like the one over the endangered northern spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest.
 
Basis of Concept
 The idea is that by focusing on whole ecosystems while habitat is plentiful, it is not necessary to preserve every single patch of it, and there is consequently more flexibility in negotiating tradeoffs between landholders and conservation interests. Humans are considered part of the ecosystem, too, according to this approach, and their interests are factored into the recovery plan. A number of tests of this idea are under way around the country, including in southern California, Texas and Florida.
The Secretary of Interior, Bruce Babbitt, who is responsible for enforcing the Endangered Species Act, eagerly embraced this concept soon after he took office and promoted it as a way to avoid what he called "train wrecks" like the spotted owl dispute. He proposed the establishment of a National Biological Survey, which would provide an inventory of the nation's biological riches. Without such an inventory, he said, it would be impossible to carry out a preventive-medicine plan based on an ecosystem approach.
The ecosystem-wide, multispecies approach would be assigned highest priority under a bill to revise the Endangered Species Act introduced by Representative Gerry E. Studds, Democrat of Massachusetts, in competition with the pending Tauzin bill. But the Studds bill does not provide for preventive measures to save species before they become candidates for listing as threatened or endangered. How all of this might be resolved is unclear, especially since Mr. Babbitt takes the position that the existing law contains all the authority needed to pursue the new approach.
All such considerations about improving the Federal effort to preserve biological diversity have now bumped smack up against the growing and vocal property-rights movement. At first, some members of the movement seemed receptive to the early-intervention, ecosystem-wide approach.
"I bought into that initially," said Chuck Cushman, executive director of the National Inholders Association, one of the most visible and active property-rights groups. "That made sense." The group, which is changing its name to the American Land Rights Association, is based in Battle Ground, Wash.
 
Suspicions About Survey
 But as events unfolded, Mr. Cushman said, he became convinced that the National Biological Survey, which is essential to the new approach, would become an instrument through which property rights would be infringed.
Under a House bill to establish the survey, he said, nonprofessional volunteers would have been empowered to go onto private lands without the owners' knowledge or approval, and to write up biological assessments that the owners would have no opportunity to see or challenge. Mr. Cushman said these assessments could end up freezing the use and development of property if they delineated the land as a hot spot for the protection of species. At the same time, Mr. Babbitt's actions to raise grazing fees on public lands in the West made his motives suspect to property advocates.
"His true agenda becomes clear: to use this as a massive private-property control-taking measure," Mr. Cushman said of the biological survey. "He may be honest in what he said before, but the bureaucracy is going to use it that way."
Despite such objections, the biological survey has been established by administrative action, backed by $164 million approved as part of the Interior Department's appropriations bill, which was passed by Congress this month. The survey came into existence last Friday. A bill to establish it more formally and permanently, in law, has passed the House with a number of amendments, including restrictions on the use of volunteers and requirements that property owners be informed in writing before surveyors come onto their land. The requirement for compensating property owners was defeated on a point of procedure.
The Congressional experience with the National Biological Survey may be making proponents of the Endangered Species Act nervous about its future prospects.
"Everything I hear is that they're going to hold off as long as they can" in bringing the law's reauthorization to a vote, said an Interior Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "My guess is next year, with a big question mark."
Congress can delay the showdown by simply putting off reauthorization, and it has delayed it by one year already. With Congressional elections coming in 1994, another year's delay might be in the cards.
Whenever the showdown comes, the extent to which the combatants can reconcile the protection of nature with property rights is likely to influence the struggle to conserve the nation's shrinking store of wild plant, animal and microbial species for years afterward.

HEADLINE: Puerto Rico Chooses, for Now

 BODY:
The close vote in Puerto Rico favoring continued commonwealth status rather than statehood will be greeted with relief in Washington. It spares Congress from deciding how and whether to admit a Spanish-speaking island to the Union.
Gov. Pedro Rossello's New Progressive Party hoped that Sunday's nonbinding referendum would build momentum for Puerto Rico's admission as the 51st state. But this course was preferred by only 46 percent of the voters, compared with 48 percent for commonwealth status and 4 percent for independence. That effectively sidetracks the statehood campaign, at least for now. 
 Yet the plebiscite does not resolve a more fundamental question: Is Puerto Rico a colony? The honest answer is yes and no.
Puerto Rico is clearly a willing subordinate. President Clinton, and most mainlanders, agree that the islanders themselves should be free to choose their final status. And overwhelmingly, Puerto Ricans favor one of two forms of association with the United States; there is no clamor for independence. In 1952 Congress approved commonwealth status, and a year later Washington persuaded the United Nations to take Puerto Rico off its list of colonies.
Even so, in vital respects Puerto Rico remains a dependent ward. Under commonwealth status Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, to a point. They can settle anywhere on the mainland, and on the island they elect their Governor and legislature. But because islanders pay no Federal income taxes, they do not elect U.S. senators or representatives or vote for President.
This arrangement, sweetened by other tax breaks, has spurred investment from the mainland, created jobs and raised wages, a boon that doubtless caused many Puerto Ricans to prefer remaining in a familiar halfway house to the risks of economic pain with any change.
But Puerto Ricans are reminded of their diminished citizenship when Washington gives short shrift to their petitions. The Treasury Department barely consulted islanders this year in proposing elimination of Federal tax incentives that Puerto Ricans deem essential to their economy. Twice since 1953, Puerto Ricans petitioned Congress for changes to enhance commonwealth status; Congress did nothing. Nor could it agree two years ago on a plebiscite whose results would be binding.
Many who voted for continued commonwealth status did so to protect Puerto Rico's distinct culture from homogenization into the English-speaking mainland. This choice of cultural autonomy short of national independence deserves respect in a world groping with the dilemmas of self-determination. Now that Puerto Rico has voiced its preference, it is incumbent upon Washington to react more sensitively to Puerto Rican requests and to continued exploration of the island's status.

HEADLINE: Running Scared From Nafta

 BODY:
Only one Democrat in the House from New York, New Jersey or Connecticut -- Nita Lowey, who represents parts of Westchester, Queens and the Bronx -- supports the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. What accounts for the near-united opposition, even from such ardent free-traders as Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and Charles Schumer of Brooklyn?
Most opponents profess anxiety about Nafta's impact on the local economy. But in private, some admit that their opposition owes more to calculations of political survival than to judgments of economic merit. 
 Local Democrats fear the wrath of organized labor. And well they should. As the accompanying table shows, labor political action committees contribute handsomely to their election campaigns. Though it's impossible to say just how much the PAC money explains opposition to Nafta, there's an unsettling pattern.
Nafta would eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers among the three countries over 15 years. This would spur economic gains, but the primary benefit is political: Nafta would lock Mexico into market reforms that could weaken the ruling party's authoritarian grip. Rejection would undermine Mr. Clinton's Presidency and his ability to negotiate other free-trade agreements.
The impact of Nafta on parts of the local economy could be beneficial. Some low-wage manufacturing jobs in the garment industry, for example, will be lost. But for every job lost to Mexican imports there will be at least one job created in export industries.
New York State exported over $1 billion worth of goods -- scientific instruments, chemical products, electronic equipment -- to Mexico last year, and that number will rise rapidly under Nafta. Nafta would also open up Mexico to U.S. banks, securities and telecommunications companies and exporters of management and other services, areas in which New York City excels. And the agreement provides strong protection for copyrights, patents and other intellectual materials -- exports that are vital to the current and future health of the New York City economy.
So why, then, have almost all local Democrats turned their backs on Nafta? Besides the PAC money, labor's endorsement is often key to electoral victory in the New York metropolitan region. And labor hasn't been bashful about threatening to retaliate against representatives who stray on Nafta. In times of economic distress, Nafta's potential victims, no matter how few in number, will know who these politicians are and blame them for any job losses. Nafta's beneficiaries -- for example, the low-income families that would gain the most from low-cost imports of clothes and food -- are spread out all over the region, are less well organized and don't have anything as dramatic as their jobs at stake. And many workers have been convinced -- wrongly -- that their jobs are on the line, leaving politicians fearful that they will be blamed for every plant closing whatever the reason.
Some Democrats might have supported Nafta had they been backed early and hard by the White House. But Mr. Clinton started campaigning late. He didn't pressure Democrats to fall in line, so many declared themselves against Nafta and can't now easily reverse course. But perhaps one or two -- as well as the many undecided Democrats and Republicans outside New York -- will decide to stand up to pressure and vote yes tomorrow. If so, voters should give them credit for courage -- and doing what's in their own long-term interest.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Nafta Hits Intellectuals

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
No need to worry. Nafta will not cost the job of a single American factory or agricultural worker. No plant or farm will be put out of business.
However, because of various complicated Nafta tax and anti-subsidy provisions, some other Americans will experience inconvenience. 
 Jobs will be lost by several hundred thousand editorial writers, columnists and other journalists, plus publishing executives, university professors, Wall Street specialists and members of state and Federal legislative staffs. A few dozen think tanks will close down altogether.
But unemployment insurance will be available, often, for these newly unemployed intellectuals. And many may be retrained for jobs as newsroom receptionists, school custodians or clerks in automated warehouses.
Of course they must be flexible -- willing to sell their homes, pull their children out of school and hunt for new jobs in other cities around the country. Many will find employment above the minimum wage, probably, if they take care not to be too old to compete with high school dropouts.
But being educated people they will also understand that contrasted to the possibility of a better balance of trade with Mexico their problems are entirely minor and not whine about it.
Anyway, perhaps things will pick up for them toward the end of the 90's.
Ah -- all this has been my evil little fantasy these past couple of weeks. Ah -- how they would howl, those journalistic and academic supporters of Nafta who have shown so little care, compassion or understanding about the fears of working people who might lose their jobs, how they would howl if their own jobs were in danger.
I can hear them already, because I have heard them so often before. If a newspaper is in danger of closing, or Wall Street brokers have a bad year, or if professors face loss of tenure for anything but murder, we fill pages of print and hours of air time with sheer poignancy.
But we really do expect workers who lose their jobs after years at a craft or assembly line to be sweet and humble, because some day some other workers in some other factory may pick up jobs.
I was in favor of Nafta, though I never did think the Republic would collapse, America be driven from the company of decent nations and extraterrestrials take over if it did not pass. But now the Administration and the intelligentsia have converted me to opposition to the current version of Nafta.
The genuine fears of frightened workers are dismissed contemptuously by the Clinton Administration, press and academia. If that is true now, while workers are still fighting, what care will be shown them or their thoughts if they are defeated and find themselves out of work in the name of grander interest?
I am a company man; any union that threatens my paper, watch out. But that does not turn me into some kook union-hater, spilling over with rage at unions exercising their right to lobby.
The Administration's attack on the whole A.F.L.-C.I.O. and its leaders is not only unjust, but damaging to freedom movements everywhere.
When it was not at all fashionable, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and Lane Kirkland, its president, came to the quiet assistance of freedom fighters, dissidents and political prisoners throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. The U.S. will need Kirklands again.
But Mr. Kirkland is suddenly painted Mussolini and his members a bunch of know-nothing boobs.
Workers fear that Nafta would preserve child labor, abysmal wages and government-police union-busting in Mexico. All of these are brutally unfair to Mexicans and to competing U.S. workers. And in case anybody cares about such niceties, Mr. Kirkland argues they also run counter to provisions in U.S. free-trade laws.
But if this version of Nafta is defeated, American business, labor and government still have a chance to try to negotiate a Nafta that would open Mexico not only to free trade but to free unions and halfway decent pay.
President Clinton says he needs Nafta as a message of support to the Asian summit meeting in Seattle. If he loses, maybe the message will be even stronger: In Asia as in the U.S. and Mexico, Americans are against slave wages, forced labor, child labor and government union-smashing.
Aren't we supposed to be?

HEADLINE: Haitians Suffer With and Without Sanctions

 BODY:

To the Editor:
We appreciate the prominence and timeliness of "Study Says Sanctions Kill Up to 1,000 Children a Month" (front page, Nov. 9), describing our study titled "Sanctions in Haiti: Crisis in Humanitarian Action." You correctly convey our findings, except for the following two points. 
 (1) The headline is misleading. Our report attributed the excess child deaths and malnutrition to a "multidimensional political crisis," which included "political sanctions and an economic embargo . . . superimposed upon a crisis of governance, a military coup d'etat, the de facto government's mismanagement, an atmosphere of political violence and repression, and evasive and black-market activities by the private business community." We do not attribute all human damage to sanctions, but noted that sanctions have exacerbated a complex crisis.
(2) You do not include our primary conclusions that "The September 1991 coup was the triggering event of the crisis" and that "the long-term health and nutrition of the people of Haiti depend upon democracy, good governance and the protection of human rights."
Unfortunately, by emphasizing the embargo over other complex issues affecting the health of children and families, your article could be misused by the Haitian military and others who oppose sanctions in Haiti.
Our report does not address whether sanctions should now be tightened, extended or withdrawn. Our major recommendation is that whatever sanctions may be imposed, the United States and the international community should at the same time accept responsibility to mitigate the suffering and to protect the lives of innocent civilians.

HEADLINE: Clinton Takes Political Risk in Talking to Chinese

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
In meeting China's President in Seattle on Friday, President Clinton is gambling that the strategy of tentatively embracing Beijing's leaders rather than castigating them will work better for him than it did for President George Bush.
The one-hour meeting, the highest-level contact since China suppressed pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, comes after a formal policy review in September that led to a decision to shift away from threats and finger-pointing and substitute what a top Administration specialist called "enhanced engagement." 
 Mr. Clinton was so determined to turn the deteriorating relationship around that in September he opened high-level exchanges with Beijing and sent President Jiang Zemin a letter announcing that the United States would help promote a "strong, stable and prosperous China."
It did not seem to matter that Mr. Jiang's most important title is General Secretary of the Communist Party, or that in last year's campaign Mr. Clinton had accused Mr. Bush of "coddling" China's leadership.
There are some differences in both the policy and the risks for the two Administrations. President Clinton started off in office as a far tougher critic of the Chinese and, unlike Mr. Bush, he is willing to link trade benefits to Beijing's human rights performance, at least in the abstract.
Because of Mr. Bush's close association to China, dating from the 1970's when he was the American envoy, he was excoriated in Congress and in the press for meeting with Prime Minister Li Peng at the United Nations in January 1992. By contrast, there has been virtually no criticism of Mr. Clinton's planned meeting with Mr. Jiang. Administration officials maintain that this is due to a tougher track record that they hope will now make the switch to a softer line more effective.
On the lofty political level, the American goal is to convince China that it is in its national interest to liberalize its political process. Mr. Clinton will tell his Chinese counterpart that if China wants to continue to export its goods to the United States under the same low tariffs enjoyed by most other nations, it must make broad changes in its human rights policies now, rather than wait until the benefits face renewal in June.
 
What China Must Do
 The concern is that China may do too little too late in meeting the requirements of a May 1993 executive order linking extension of the trade benefits to China's progress on releasing of political prisoners, ceasing the jamming of international broadcasts, implementing the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, protecting Tibet's cultural and religious heritage and allowing visits by international humanitarian organizations.
On a more mundane level, the Administration's policy is driven by Mr. Clinton's determination that the United States get a larger chunk of the world's fastest-growing market. China's trade surplus with the United States could exceed that of Japan's by the end of the decade.
That means a renewal of China's trade benefits, because China has threatened to retaliate against American companies if the privileges are withdrawn. And all of the Administration's economic agencies have begun to weigh in heavily on China policy, arguing that the interests of commerce should prevail over other policy considerations.
 
Criticism From Christopher
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who has not acted on Foreign Minister Qian Qichen's invitation to visit China, is the Administration's most vocal advocate of Beijing's need to do much more if it wants to keep its preferential trade status.
At a briefing Monday, Mr. Christopher characterized as helpful but inadequate such isolated gestures as China's announcement last week that it will give "positive consideration" to allowing the Red Cross to visit prisoners.
The latest indication of China's attitude toward human rights came on Monday, when two dissidents were apparently seized by police and disappeared after attending a meeting to promote nonviolent political reform.
In a speech to a business group in Hong Kong today, Mr. Bush could not resist criticizing his successor's attempts to impose democratic values abroad. Saying China's economic leap forward had made its society much freer than when he was the envoy, he warned that to revoke China's trading privileges would isolate China and narrow Washington's influence.
 
Questions of Missiles
 But kind gestures and sweet talk in Washington do not necessarily produce results in Beijing, as evidenced by China's determination to sell ballistic missiles in violation of an international accord.
During a visit to Beijing in 1988, Secretary of State George P. Shultz was unable to dissuade the Chinese from going forward with contracts to sell such missiles; three years later, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d ended talks in China under the erroneous impression that the Chinese would adhere to their pledges not to export missiles or technology that violated the accord.
The Clinton Administration is fighting the same battle and, thus far, the Chinese are winning.
The Administration imposed sanctions on an estimated $1 billion in high-technology trade with China last August, as required under United States law, after intelligence agencies reported that China had shipped technology and components for M-11 missiles to Pakistan.
China has refused to pledge adherence to the accord. In a meeting with senior State Department officials in Washington early this month, the Deputy Foreign Minister, Liu Huaqiu, said Beijing would be willing to open a formal dialogue with the United States only after Washington lifted the sanctions.
 
Gesture of Good Will
 As a gesture of good will to the Chinese, Mr. Clinton's senior advisers are recommending that he accept a broad interpretation of the law requiring sanctions. That would enable him to announce to Mr. Jiang that he was allowing the export of two of the seven satellites affected by the sanctions.
Mr. Clinton's advisers are also urging that he approve the sale of a supercomputer for meteorological purposes that some nonproliferation experts in the Administration fear could be put to military uses.
The Clinton-Jiang meeting will certainly be Mr. Clinton's most important encounter during an economic summit meeting that will bring together leaders of the 15-member Asia-Pacific Economic Conference.
But a subdrama of another sort may also play out in Seattle: Mr. Christopher's search for a deputy after the forced resignation of Clifton R. Wharton Jr. last week.
 
Post Turned Down
 Senior Administration officials said Mr. Christopher's first choice was Michael H. Armacost, who served as Ambassador to Japan and was the third-ranking official in Mr. Baker's State Department. But Mr. Armacost, now a visiting professor at the Asia-Pacific Research Center, turned it down.
While senior officials said Mr. Christopher may try to change Mr. Armacost's mind, he is also focusing on several other candidates, including two officials who will be demonstrating their diplomatic mettle in Seattle this week: J. Stapleton Roy, the Ambassador to China, and Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs.
The front-runner -- at least on the lists of some officials among State Department executives -- remains Thomas R. Pickering, the Ambassador to Russia; unlike Mr. Armacost, he is said to be very interested in serving as Mr. Christopher's No. 2.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: The Overview;
Scramble in the Capital for Today's Trade Pact Vote

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
On the eve of a crucial vote in the House of Representatives, the White House today won pledges of support for the North American Free Trade Agreement from legislators who had publicly opposed it.
For the first time, the number of representatives who have declared their support for the agreement surged ahead of its opponents. Together with private assurances made to the White House, that appeared to leave President Clinton and his allies poised to claim the narrowest of victories. 
 While opinion polls show that voters are not inclined to hold a vote for the agreement against their elected representative, lawmakers and the White House alike think it could be a source of vulnerability. And the White House today concocted one last blend of deal making, inspiration and flattery to convince reluctant representatives that the accord was worth the risk to their political futures.
 
Heavyweight Endorsements
 To widen support for the accord from Florida representatives, for instance, the Administration was relying on an agreement to protect producers of citrus fruit, sugar and winter vegetables. To prick others' consciences, all five surviving former Presidents joined for the first time in a formal letter appealing to lawmakers not to let a historic opportunity pass.
And to embolden the wavering, Mr. Clinton also invoked endorsements from 40 governors and heaped praise in advance on the final converts, asserting that voting for the accord was an act of political courage.
"Many members of Congress are literally willing to put their political careers on the line tomorrow night to do what they think is right even though they're not quite sure their voters agree with them yet," the President said at the White House this morning.
Flanked by 15 governors, including Gov. Pedro J. Rossello of Puerto Rico, at what amounted to one last campaign event, Mr. Clinton described the growth of support on Capitol Hill as "quite moving."
 
Tariffs Live Again
 Still, it became apparent today that one price the Administration had paid in seeking support for the trade accord had been to undermine the agreement's central objective. To win passage of a pact that eliminates taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada, the White House has agreed to reimpose some trade barriers, not just for orange juice but for a grocery list of commodities. [Page A21.]
This week alone, the White House made arrangements to limit shipments of Canadian peanut butter and wheat to the United States, to prevent Australian and New Zealand beef from entering the United States through Mexico, and to raise tariffs temporarily on Mexican tomatoes and other winter vegetables.
White House officials insisted today that those changes had simply made the trade agreement fairer for American producers.
After weeks of portraying their fight for Congressional approval of the accord as an uphill struggle, and some unease this morning after news accounts described their new confidence, White House officials said privately tonight that the shifting tide on Capitol Hill had given them great optimism that the vote would go their way.
 
'We're Going to Win'
 A senior official who briefed reporters at the White House said Mr. Clinton was "within single digits" of winning the 218 votes needed for passage in the House. Another Presidential aide said flatly tonight, "We're going to win."
Approval in the Senate has been regarded as more or less certain, and if the House approves the pact, Senate action is expected before Congress adjourns next week for the year.
Eight hours has been allotted for Wednesday's debate in the House. No amendments will be allowed. A vote is expected between 8 P.M. and 10 P.M.
At least 15 representatives announced their support for the agreement today, and few if any declared their opposition to it.
Among governors, Mario M. Cuomo of New York has come out against the pact, and Jim Florio of New Jersey has told the White House he is undecided. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut did not respond to a White House request for his position.
 
'I Feel Abandoned'
 Today, for the first time, leaders of organized labor began speaking with a tinge of foreboding after accounts of more legislators shifting into the President's camp. A day after the head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. strongly criticized Mr. Clinton for supporting the accord, labor leaders spoke bitterly about what they see as the White House's willingness to make any deal necessary to win approval of the agreement.
"I feel abandoned by Clinton," said Robert M. McGlotten, chief lobbyist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "Why can't we have a deal for workers if deals can be struck for citrus, sugar and plate glass?"
Among legislators who had publicly opposed the trade pact but said today that they would vote for it were Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat of Tennessee; Representative Sam Farr, Democrat of California, and Representative Tom Lewis, Republican of Florida. Among those who had been undecided but announced their support today was Representative Floyd H. Flake, Democrat of Queens.
Almost all of the 23-member Florida delegation formally opposed the accord a week ago. But after a meeting of the delegation this morning, it appeared possible that a majority of members would vote for the pact, and Mr. Lewis made clear he had been swayed by the assurances of protection for the state's citrus industry.
"I have long been opposed to passage of the Nafta based on its potential damage on Florida's $6 billion agriculture industry," the North Palm Beach Congressman said. "However, solutions have been successfully negotiated and completed to insure that Florida farmers will be treated fairly under the Nafta."
Most, if not all, of the 11th-hour converts had met privately at the White House with the President, who continued his lobbying today. Mr. Clinton took time out to bask in the governors' support but spent most of the day wooing legislators by phone or in person.
 
'Loneliness' of Decisions
 In addition to the more than 210 House members who have declared their support for the trade agreement, an unspecified number have told the President they will side with him if their vote is needed, aides to Mr. Clinton have said. The aides said today that they still expected to have to call upon those people.
Mr. Clinton got a strong dose of support today from his predecessors. Their endorsement of a trade-accord appeal was sent by express mail to every House member and represented the first time the signatures of Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush appeared on the same document.
The letter, drafted by aides to Mr. Carter, expressed a shared familiarity with "the loneliness of making difficult decisions" but told the lawmakers that they had the opportunity "to sign your name on the right side of America's history."
"Nafta represents a turning point for America," the former Presidents said. "If you vote against it, the role of the United States as a world leader will be severely damaged, and the prosperity of the United States and the international economy will be endangered."
The 15 governors who traveled to Washington today to appear with Mr. Clinton were divided almost equally between Republicans and Democrats, reflecting the bipartisan alliance the White House has sought to forge in Congress for the treaty.
There was some confusion today over how many governors had declined to go on record in favor of the agreement, either by declaring against it, saying they were undecided or declining to respond to a survey.
The survey was conducted in the summer by Policy Review, the journal of the Heritage Foundation, and cited today by the White House, which said that 10 Governors had declined to go on record in favor.
According to Policy Review, and taking into account changes in positions since the survey was conducted, just eight Governors have declined to favor it. In addition to Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Florio and Mr. Weicker, they are L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who has declared his opposition; Brereton Jones of Kentucky, who says he is undecided; and Jim Folson of Alabama, Zell Miller of Georgia and
Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, who did not reply, the journal said.
All are Democrats except Mr. Weicker, who is an independent.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: A Hard-Won Vote;
Voting Yes on Trade Accord Is Folly in Rust Belt. Or Is It?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Representative Tom Sawyer of Akron, Ohio, a Democrat from the burliest of American factory towns now fallen on the toughest of times, swallowed hard today and pledged his vote to a North American Free Trade Agreement that factory men everywhere despise. Political instinct and Roy Hodoh say this makes him a political short-timer.
"I'm going to tell you right now: he's out of the 14th Congressional District," Mr. Hodoh, the president of United Auto Workers Local 856, said angrily in an interview today. The workers of Local 856 counted on Mr. Sawyer to oppose the agreement, Mr. Hodoh said, adding that they would not forget his "very disrespectful, deceitful" action next November. 
 But the truth is that Mr. Sawyer's vote, and his fate, are beholden to a force stronger than either instinct or Mr. Hodoh's influence: demographics. There are not that many factory workers left in Akron. The vast tire plants and aircraft factories that once blanketed the city with soot are going or gone. Akron's growth and its apparent future lie in polymer research laboratories and small nonunion makers of specialized plastics they fostered.
Mr. Sawyer cited one Akron company that produces a special polymer whose exports to Mexico have grown more than thirtyfold despite high tariffs. Lowering those tariffs, as the trade agreement would do, would cause the exports to grow even more.
 
Far-Reaching Changes
 Mr. Hodoh's own local is an example of the transformation. Just four years ago, it carried 1,800 workers on its rolls. Today it has 600.
The same sort of tectonic shifts are remaking both the political and economic fault lines in dozens of big and small factory towns across the nation's manufacturing heartland known in its decline as the Rust Belt. They are a major reason why a decision to support the hotly debated trade agreement with Mexico and Canada by Mr. Sawyer and lawmakers in similar districts may not be as perilous as it seems at first blush.
Not that it is risk free. A five-term Congressman from an eternally Democratic district that includes Akron and its rural environs, Mr. Sawyer agonized publicly for weeks before deciding, after a heart-to-heart talk with President Clinton on Monday, to join the treaty's supporters.
"It was, by a considerable margin, perhaps the toughest decision I've ever had to make in public life," he said in an interview today. "Probably this vote is more easily misunderstood than any vote I've ever cast."
 
Pain and Opportunity
 "He wins the award for most tortured," said one White House official who watched as Mr. Clinton wooed Mr. Sawyer in two White House meetings and at least four telephone calls. That official described Mr. Sawyer as looking "awfully pale" after the final session.
The agony is easy to understand. Mr. Sawyer describes his decision as a vote for the new Akron that is emerging from the industrial collapse of the 1970's and 1980's. The rebuilding of the city has peppered it with hundreds of speciality manufacturers that conduct thriving export businesses.
"The kind of visceral response in opposition is understandable," he said. But outweighing it, he said, is the fact that Akron "is so well positioned on the other hand to take advantage of the opportunity before us."
In political terms, it is hard to see Mr. Sawyer's decision as anything other than a departure from the traditional Democratic alliance with organized labor, with its demands to be insulated from foreign competition in industries like steel and autos, and a step toward a new and broader constituency.
 
Change of Mentality
 As recently as 1989, Mr. Sawyer drew a 100 rating, the best possible, from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Last year his rating was 83, his lowest ever. Today, one senior Administration official who would speak only on the condition of not being named said Mr. Sawyer's "real dilemma was between being a person from the past and a new Democrat."
"This whole turn from protectionism toward international markets is tough," the official said. "Breaking that old Rust Belt mentality is a hard thing to do."
That is true not just of Mr. Sawyer, but of Akron and other Middle American cities as well. Those who rode the booms of the two coasts during the last 30 years have little notion of the devastation wreaked in Midwestern cities during that same time or the scars it has left.
Akron made its name in rubber. At one time it was home to four of the world's largest tire companies. But the city closed its last automobile tire plant in the 1970's, and the last truck and aircraft tire plant in 1984. Today only one company in the tire industry still counts the city as its world headquarters, as foreign ownership has severed the industry's ties.
 
'They Left in Droves'
 The departure of the tire behemoths only illustrates a larger wasting of the city's industrial muscle. From 1960 to 1990, one study found, the number of workers claiming union membership withered to 12 percent from 60 percent and is doubtless smaller today.
"We've lost maybe 200,000 jobs in the last 15 years, mostly high-wage, low-education ones," said David G. Meyer, a professor of management at the University of Akron. "They left in droves." About two-thirds of those jobs, he said, have been replaced by low-skill and often part-time work in stores, hotels and other service businesses.
The remaining third, he said, has fueled the growth of the city's advanced technology plastics industry and related businesses.
"The voting populace is broken into basically two groups: the professional group and the lower-level, relatively low-education job group." Mr. Meyer said. The former largely back the trade agreement. As for the latter, Mr. Sawyer said: "For the most part their jobs can't be moved to Mexico, and they know it. You can't take a mall or fast-food joint and move it to Mexico."
Ten years ago, that backlash from Mr. Sawyer's decision to cross the city's factory constituency and support the agreement might have been big enough to toss him straight out of office. But perhaps not now.
"Akron has changed," said Joe Rice, an Ohio political consultant. "So has labor's role in it. This vote is probably going to hurt him some. But the city is changing so much that the vote is probably in the best interest of Akron."

HEADLINE: Japan's New Leader Wins a Crucial Vote On Political Reform

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa won a key vote today on a package of bills that would reshape the corruption-tainted electoral system, setting Japan squarely on course for its most sweeping political change in decades.
The 21-to-19 vote by a committee of Parliament to redraw the parliamentary districts, reapportion seats and limit corporate political donations was a major coup for the reform-minded Mr. Hosokawa and, political experts said, a sign that Japan is finally casting off its old political order. It also broke a five-year deadlock during which the political system sank deeper and deeper into a series of corruption scandals. 
 The bitter battle over electoral reform brought down the last two Governments and ultimately ended 38 years of one-party rule by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party this summer. Mr. Hosokawa, a highly popular conservative politician, has staked the future of his frail seven-party coalition Government on enacting the legislation.
With today's vote, Mr. Hosokawa appears certain to gain approval for the election reform package from the full lower house of Parliament on Thursday. The upper house is expected to approve the bills before year's end.
The approval of the legislation is likely to shore up the unusual coalition of right- and left-wing parties that Mr. Hosokawa heads, strengthen his hand in talks scheduled for Friday with President Clinton in Seattle and, perhaps most important, give critical impetus to Mr. Hosokawa's goals of opening the economy and reining in the powerful Government bureaucracy.
"The face of Japanese politics is just beginning to change now for real," said Takeshi Sasaki, a political scientist at Tokyo University. "This shows that the Government now has the political will to move on to the other issues: reform of the administrative system, reform of the economy and even the trading system."
Kenzo Uchida, a popular political commentator, remarked, "When this passes and an election is held under the new system, the old political structure will be in chaos."
In the current system, the 511 members of the more powerful lower house of Parliament are elected in three- to six-seat districts, many of which were devised in the 1920's. That system often pits members of the same party against one another, encouraging them to compete not on the issues but by offering cash rewards or preferred access to Government licenses and contracts.
 
Gain for Urban Voters
 Under the new bills, the number of seats would be reduced to 500, with cities gaining representatives and rural areas, whose population has been slowly declining for years, losing some. For instance, Tokyo's representation would grow from 21 to 23 seats.
A total of 274 members of Parliament would be elected directly in single-seat constituencies. The remaining 226 seats would be filled on the basis of proportional representation by party affiliation. Voters would cast two votes, one for the representative from their district and one for a party.
Corporate contributions to individual politicians -- a recurrent source of scandals and indictments -- would be banned. Corporations would still be permitted to donate funds to political parties but would have to comply with stricter reporting requirements.
Taxpayer money would be used to subsidize campaigning as well. The bills would provide the equivalent of $290 million in public funds for elections.
The angriest opposition came from some members of the two parties that dominated Japanese politics during the cold-war years: the Liberal Democrats, who controlled the Government from 1955 until this year and are now in the opposition, and the Socialists, long the largest opposition party, who have uneasily assumed the position of the largest party in the governing coalition. Ultimately, the Liberal Democrats rejected the bills, while the Socialists backed them.
 
Big Change in Election Finances
 The changes would eliminate what have been safe seats for some members of the two parties, while completely overturning their traditional means of financing election campaigns. As a result, some Liberal Democrats and Socialists threatened to quit their parties if there was too much compromise on the election reform package.
"The Socialist Party will perish after these continual compromises," complained Sukio Iwatare, a Socialist member of Parliament. "Why do we have to choke ourselves?"
Other Liberal Democrats and Socialists warned that the public, which is solidly behind the reforms, would never forgive the parties if they refused to compromise. The intraparty strains were evident in the fact that the Liberal Democrats hastily had to replace five members of the parliamentary committee that voted today and the Socialists changed two members after it became clear that the original members were planning to vote against their party lines.
Hard-line Liberal Democratic opponents of the bills said their party should have boycotted the session to embarrass the governing coalition. But Mr. Hosokawa and his coalition partners -- most of whom defected from the Liberal Democratic Party earlier this year -- appear to have executed a carefully calculated maneuver to show the opposition as intransigent and the Government as flexible and pragmatic.
After the vote, a buoyant Mr. Hosokawa cruised the crowd of broadly smiling legislators, shaking hands and basking in the glow of the first occasion on which he has moved beyond oratory to actually produce some of the changes he has promised.

HEADLINE: Clinton Signs Law Protecting Religious Practices

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
President Clinton today signed into law legislation requiring the Government to meet stringent standards before instituting measures that might interfere with religious practices.
The new law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, overturns a 1990 Supreme Court ruling that set a looser standard for laws that restrict religious practices. 
 That ruling, Employment Division v. Smith, abandoned a long accepted principle of constitutional interpretation that required the Government to demonstrate a "compelling state interest" to justify any measure restricting religious practices. Under the ruling, restrictions were acceptable as long as they were not aimed at religious groups alone.
The new law restores the old standard, and even in cases where Government concerns like health or safety do justify infringements of religious practices, the new law requires the use of whatever means would be least restrictive to religion.
After the 1990 decision, religious groups could not claim exemptions from routine legislation or regulations on the basis of the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom.
 
Gore Hails New Law
 Speaking at the White House signing ceremony today, Vice President Al Gore illustrated the kind of cases that have been affected.
"Those whose religion forbids autopsies have been subjected to mandatory autopsies," he said. "Those who want churches close to where they live have seen churches zoned out of residential areas. Those who want the freedom to design their churches have seen local governments dictate the configuration of their building."
Supporters of the law say that 50 to 60 cases of government infringements on religious practices have been justified in the courts on the basis of the 1990 ruling.
President Clinton hailed the new law at the signing ceremony, saying that it held government "to a very high level of proof before it interferes with someone's free exercise of religion."
J. Brent Walker, general counsel of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs called the new law "the most significant piece of legislation dealing with our religious liberty in a generation."
His sentiments were echoed by many other members of an unusual coalition of liberal, conservative and religious groups that had pressed for the new law. The coalition included the National Association of Evangelicals, the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Council of Churches, the American Jewish Congress, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Mormon Church, the Traditional Values Coalition and the American Civil Liberties Union.
In the Senate, where the bill was approved 97 to 3 on Oct. 27, it was sponsored by Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah. In the House, which passed the bill last May by a voice vote without objection, it was sponsored by Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, and Representative Christopher C. Cox, Republican of California.
President Clinton voiced wonder today at this alliance of forces that are often at odds across religious or ideological lines. "The power of God is such that even in the legislative process miracles can happen," he said.
 
Case in Oregon
 The 1990 case upheld the denial of unemployment benefits by the State of Oregon to an American Indian who was dismissed from a job in a drug rehabilitation program for using the hallucinogenic drug peyote as part of a ritual of the Native American Church. Oregon has a general law banning peyote use, which at that time did not exempt its use for religious purposes.
The Court's majority decision, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, held that the First Amendment did not oblige Oregon to show a "compelling state interest" for refusing such an exemption. If such exemptions were to be established, it had to be done by legislation, not the courts, Justice Scalia said.
Although supporters of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act saw that ruling as having wide implications, especially for small religious groups without political muscle, they said they at first found it hard to rouse public concern about a case involving hallucinogenic drugs.

HEADLINE: Albany Accord Supports Clinics For Mentally Ill

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
The New York State Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo reached agreement yesterday on a landmark mental health bill that would dedicate money saved by closing psychiatric hospitals to caring for mentally ill people living in communities throughout the state.
After months of haggling, the Governor and the chairmen of the Senate and Assembly committees that oversee mental health issues agreed to close five state mental hospitals and to reduce the number of beds in other hospitals by 2,400. 
 Of the $210 million in projected savings during five years, $180 million would be spent on clinical care, rehabilitation and vocational training for mentally ill people who are no longer hospitalized.
 
Help for the Homeless
 Another $30 million in savings would be set aside to aid the homeless mentally ill and mentally ill people addicted to drugs or alcohol.
At least half the $210 million would go to New York City, where the sometimes menacing presence of the homeless mentally ill on the streets has become a sensitive political issue in many neighborhoods.
Backers said they expected the mental-health bill to be passed by both houses when the Legislature reconvenes next month.
As agreement was being reached on the mental health bill, the Assembly convened to deal with some other lingering pieces of legislation. It gave final approval to a bill that is intended to end years of fraud and misconduct on the part of New York City's school custodians by delegating to principals and the city's Board of Education a degree of control over custodians' work, for the first time. [Page B1.]
 
20 to 25 Percent Increase
 The money in the mental health legislation would mean an increase of 20 to 25 percent in the state's spending on community mental health services, said State Senator Steven Sanders, a Democrat from the East Side of Manhattan who is chairman of the Assembly's Mental Health Committee.
"This is unquestionably the most dramatic reform of mental health policy in New York State in many years," he said. "For the first time, we are recognizing that people discharged from hospitals still have needs that have to be addressed and that the state has neglected for many years."
Assemblyman Nicholas Spano said: "For the first time, we'll have a mechanism to capture the savings from closing psychiatric hospitals and reinvesting that savings into the communities." Mr. Spano is a Republican from Westchester County who is chairman of the Senate Mental Heath and Developmental Disabilities Committee.
Legislators and advocates for the mentally ill hailed the agreement between Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature yesterday as a historic achievement that begins to fulfill the state's promise to care for the tens of thousands of people released from psychiatric hospitals. Since the mid-1950's, the number of people in state mental hospitals has declined from a peak of 95,000 in the mid-1950's to 10,000 today.
"This is the first legislation in 30 years that begins to stop the unchecked deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill by providing funding to follow the patients," said Cynthia Dames, executive director of the Coalition of Voluntary Mental Health Agencies.
This summer, the Legislature adopted a bill to reinvest savings from the shrinking numbers of people in state mental hospitals into community services, but Mr. Cuomo objected because the legislation made no specific provisions to close entire hospitals, many of which are important to the economies of the small communities where they are situated. Historically, the elected officials from those communities have fought the closing of the hospitals and the loss of jobs for constituents.
 
5 Hospitals to Close
 But under the terms of the agreement reached yesterday, five hospitals would close: Harlem Valley, near Poughkeepsie in the Hudson Valley, on Feb. 1, 1994; Gowanda, south of Buffalo, on April 1, 1994; Central Islip in Suffolk County on Oct. 1, 1995, and Kings Park in Suffolk County on Oct. 1, 1997. The fifth hospital, Willard, in the Finger Lakes area, does not have a specific closing date. The bill says it would be shut when officials find an alternative use for the facility.
Mr. Cuomo had also insisted that some of the money be earmarked for the homeless mentally ill and mentally ill people with drug and alcohol problems. The Legislature agreed to his terms.
"We now have a much stronger bill," Mr. Cuomo said in a statement released last night. "It specifically links reinvestment of funds in community mental health resources with state psychiatric center closings."
 
Politically Risky
 The Governor's threat to veto the bill adopted by the Legislature in July was politically risky for Mr. Cuomo because he risked being blamed if no legislation passed at all. But yesterday some of the advocates who had worried about the Governor's strategy said the new bill is better for the changes he obtained. "The Governor really improved the bill by putting on the table the closing of the five psychiatric hospitals," Ms. Dames said.
The negotiations were long and tortured. Legislators had agreed to most of the major policy changes to the bill, including the hospital closings, seven weeks ago. But until yesterday, the agreement was held up by a dispute over the local political concerns of legislators whose districts include two of the hospitals: Republican State Senators James J. Lack of East Northport, L.I., and Michael F. Nozzolio of Seneca Falls. Mr. Lack's district includes Kings Park Psychiatric Center. Mr. Nozzolio's includes Willard Psychiatric Center.
Mr. Lack insisted on local advice in deciding the future of the Kings Park site. The bill would originally have allowed the Governor to appoint the heads of all the advisory task forces that would make recommendations to the state about the future uses of the five psychiatric centers to be closed.
 
Local Advice
 But Mr. Lack won a promise yesterday that the head of the task force for Kings Park would be appointed by the task force itself, rather than by the Governor. Six of the 11 members of each task force would be appointed by local officials.
Mr. Nozzolio is concerned about providing jobs for those who would be laid off from Willard. He demanded and won state assurances that the center would not be closed before an alternative use for the site is found.
Legislative leaders said yesterday that they were confident the legislation would pass, but Mr. Sanders cautioned, "It's never done until you actually pass the bill. There's always the possibility something could go wrong."

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Mexico;
U.S. Vote Crucial for Mexico's Chief and His Party

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 16

 BODY:
After nearly five years of an administration that has changed Mexico more deeply than any other in the last half-century, the success of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's presidency and the fortunes of his party may hang on the outcome of a United States Congressional vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Contrary to the claims of many who support the accord, few economists here believe the future of free-market economic policies in Mexico will be at stake when the House of Representatives takes up the pact on Wednesday. But a vote against the agreement might well bring a chill to relations between Mexico and the United States, officials of the two countries say. Mexican officials have also warned that it could bring a backlash of anti-American sentiment here. 
 What appears most certain, though, is that Mr. Salinas's greatest gamble will either assure him a lofty place in Mexican history or begin a harsh stripping of his prestige that could bolster his leftist opposition as the country turns to the presidential elections scheduled for next August.
"Salinas is Nafta; his whole administration is Nafta," said Carlos Monsivais, a leading Mexican writer. "He has bet so loudly, so heavily. It's like political theology: we will all go to heaven or we will go to hell."
 
Stocks Set Records
 The tentative lines of Mr. Salinas's path have been drawn on separate graphs.
Over the last week, as foreign investors have bet bullishly on Congressional approval, values on the Mexican stock exchange have climbed to record heights day after day.
Yet as slow growth, tight credit and rising unemployment have darkened the economic outlook, one independent survey has shown support for Mr. Salinas dropping from 66 percent in early September to 45 percent in mid-October, the lowest level registered almost since he took office.
To those versed in the rhythms of Mexican politics, the idea of impending tragedy is more familiar.
Before Mr. Salinas faced his party's first serious electoral challenge in nearly 60 years, Mexican presidents had taken power with scant opposition and an almost absolute sense of power. Yet with presidents barred from re-election, the country's six-year political cycle weighed on the last four like a curse: one after another, successful administrations turned disastrous in their final two years.
 
A Flurry of Changes
 Jose Lopez Portillo, who governed from 1976 to 1982, was the strongest of the four before world prices for oil, Mexico's chief export, began to fall near the end of his term, and he led the country into its foreign debt crisis. Mexicans still sometimes bark when they see the former President on the street; just before he devalued the peso, ushering in 400 percent inflation, he had promised to defend the currency "like a dog."
Until this year, the term of Mr. Salinas had played out quite differently.
After an election that many Mexicans thought his Institutional Revolutionary Party stole from Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who led a coalition of leftist parties, Mr. Salinas embarked on a flurry of major economic changes. He held down wages, began closing or selling off nearly 1,000 state companies, privatized the banks and continued the dismantling of trade barriers begun when Mexico joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1986.
While renegotiating the country's $92 billion debt in 1989, Mr. Salinas began slashing annual inflation from 51.7 percent the year he took office to 9.1 percent now. Sensitive laws on land tenure, religion and education were overhauled.
 
A Pledge to His Country
 Sweeping as Mr. Salinas's initiatives have often been, none has seized the imagination of his country's 85 million people like the agreement that would join Mexico to the powerful neighbor that has often been its enemy. And until it became apparent that the accord was in trouble, Mr. Salinas sold the deal relentlessly, promising skeptical Mexicans that the pact would make them "part of the first, not the third world."
Although Mr. Salinas promoted the agreement abroad as an international guarantee of permanence for his economic reforms, economic analysts believe many of those measures have taken on lives of their own.
In May, the Government granted the central bank autonomy to set monetary policy. By next year, Mexico hopes to become the first Latin American country to join the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of industrialized nations that sets standard economic goals for its members. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum is to consider Mexico's request for admission at a meeting in Seattle this week.
Increasingly, politicians have criticized the failure of the Government to improve living standards and business executives have attacked the speed or scope of its opening to foreign competition. Yet among Mexican business people a remarkable consensus remains on the basic tenets of the new economic ideology.
"Everybody in the private sector here is convinced of the road the country has taken," said Jonathan Heath, an economic consultant in Mexico City. "You might see some things accelerate or slow down, but not a basic change in direction."
 
'The Failure of Salinas'
 Reflecting the strength of that consensus, Mr. Cardenas, the only serious challenger to the governing party who advocates a significant change in course, has for months been promising business people that he opposes only the existing trade accord, not a market economy or free trade in principle.
In an interview, Mr. Cardenas said that if the trade accord was defeated, he would direct his attack not against the United States but against "the failure of Salinas." Many political analysts believe that would give enough of a lift to Mr. Cardenas's sagging popularity to turn next year's campaign into a real race.
Their reasoning reflects the widespread belief that the essential political value of the trade agreement has been to uphold the hopes for change of millions of Mexicans who have yet to see significant personal benefits from the country's economic reforms.
Economists have predicted that over the next decade Mexico could receive as much as $15 billion in additional foreign investment if the free trade agreement is approved. A vote against the agreement would turn skittish investors away from Mexico, they say, raising pressure on the peso and possibly forcing the Government to devalue to cover the gaping $22 billion deficit in its trade of goods and services.
Yet even if the economic consequences prove severe, the political effects of a negative Congressional vote might have less to do with any real impact on people's standards of living than with their likely perception that the first world's endorsement of Mr. Salinas's policies had been withdrawn.
"The most pro-American President of the century will have been humiliated," said Federico Estevez, a political scientist here.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Dealing;
Clinton's Shopping List for Votes Has Ring of Grocery Buyer's List

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
To pass the trade deal that would eliminate taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada, the Clinton Administration has been forced to go this far: it has agreed to impose taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada.
The deal-making on the eve of the House vote Wednesday sounds a lot like a shopping list: beef, peanut butter, bread, sugar, orange juice, cucumbers, lettuce and celery. 
 To win the votes of legislators from farm states, the Clinton Administration has promised that if Mexican exports seriously cut into the American market, it will raise import taxes, as technically allowed by clauses drafted by the Bush Administration, which negotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement last year.
But the Clinton White House is apparently going far beyond what the Bush team envisioned, and has even reached two side deals with Mexico to reinterpret the language of the original pact to restrict trade in sugar and orange juice.
 
Controls on Peanut Butter
 Just this week the White House arranged to limit Canadian peanut butter and wheat shipments to the United States early next year. It also agreed to prevent Australian and New Zealand beef from entering the United States duty-free through Mexico by imposing stringent regulations requiring shippers to show that the cattle was raised in North America. And it pledged a swift procedure to raise tariffs temporarily on Mexican tomatoes and other winter vegetabables if Mexican imports capture what Washington considers too large a market share.
The deals appear to have been effective, since up to a dozen House members from agricultural districts in Oklahoma and Florida have agreed to support the President by voting for the trade pact.
As the White House struggled to round up enough votes for passage of the pact, it found rural Democratic lawmakers more amenable to making deals than legislators from the Northern and Rust Belt states, who tend to be linked to big labor and generally oppose the pact.
Farm groups' reservations about the effects of the agreement on specific crops can be addressed, as the White House has amply demonstrated this week, by tinkering with the regulations that would put the agreement into effect. The demands of urban workers are much harder to satisfy, on the other hand, because their concerns tend to more general -- that the agreement will make Mexico a more stable, profitable place to do business and encourage companies to move there.
 
Farmers Are Easier
 "The ag problems are more fixable than the labor problems," said a House member who insisted on anonymity.
Wheat growers, particularly near the Canadian border, have been among the agreement's strongest critics for many months. But the Administration won them over today by agreeing to open talks with Ottawa on ending Canadian subsidies for the transporation and marketing of the wheat, and to begin in 60 days a legal process leading quickly to import limits if the talks are unsuccessful.
The National Association of Wheat Growers responded by endorsing the pact this afternoon, as did Representatives Glenn English and Bill K. Brewster, Oklahoma Democrats from wheat-growing districts. Even the North Dakota Wheat Commission, a hard-line faction within the national wheat association, endorsed the pact today, although Representative Earl Pomeroy, a Democrat who is North Dakota's entire House delegation, said he remained opposed because the arrangement for curbing wheat imports would not take effect soon enough.
 
Farm Lobby's Influence

 The current deals may add a penny or two to the cost of a consumer's groceries by preventing tariffs on foreign competition from falling as quickly as might have been expected under the trade agreement. For example, the free-trade pact allows for the temporary raising of farm tariffs to their pre-agreement levels if imports prove damaging. The Administration has reassured lawmakers from rural areas of Florida by establishing swift procedures to put these provisions into effect for crops ranging from cucumbers and lettuce to bell peppers and tomatoes.
Representative Tom Lewis, Republican of Florida, agreed today to support the pact after the Administration included imported tomatoes on the list of vegetables subject to tariffs if they begin flooding the market. Still, Mr. Lewis said he was not pleased that the Administration had waited until the last minute to make a deal with him.
"I look with disdain on the way this whole thing has been done," Mr. Lewis said. "It almost looks like you're selling your soul."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "What the President Has Promised So Far"
 
PRODUCT: Beef
 STATUS QUO: Only North American beef will qualify for duty-free treatment, but ranchers worry that Australian and New Zealand beef will enter through Mexico.
 DEAL: Tight rules will require beef and cattle shippers to show where animals were raised.
 U.S. PRODUCTION: $37.9 billion
 
PRODUCT: Peanut Butter
 STATUS QUO: Canada imports peanuts for peanut butter, which it exports to the United States as a result of the 1989 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Consequently, Canada is exempted from America's virtual ban on peanut imports.
 DEAL: The United States will move to impose limits on Canadian shipments of peanut butter in 60 days unless Canada cuts back on the amount of shipments.
 U.S. PRODUCTION: $1.3 billion.
 
PRODUCT: Wheat
 STATUS QUO: Canadian wheat exporters have captured 25 percent of the American market and 70 percent of of the Mexican market.
 DEAL: The United States, which suspects that the Canadian government subsidizes transportation and marketing of wheat, will move to impose limits on Canadian shipments in 60 days unless Canada reduces these subsidies.
 U.S. PRODUCTION: $7.6 billion
 
PRODUCT: Frozen concentrated orange juice
 STATUS QUO: American tariffs of 9.25 cents per kilogram on orange juice imported from Mexico will be phased out over 15 years.
 DEAL: If Mexican shipments increase and American prices fall, the United States would impose steep tariffs on the additional Mexican shipments. Also, in world trade talks, the United States would not accept a cut of more than 15 percent in its tariff on Brazilian orange juice.
 U.S. PRODUCTION: $3.2 billion
 
PRODUCT: Cucumbers
 STATUS QUO: American tariffs that range from 3.3 cents to 6.6 cents per kilogram, depending on the season, will be phased out over 15 years.
 DEAL: The United States would set up an expedited system to reimpose tariffs temporarily if Mexican shipments drive down the price American goods. Also, the United States would not accept more than a 15 percent cut in tariffs in world trade talks.
 U.S. PRODUCTION: $274.9 million
 
PRODUCT: Wine
 STATUS QUO: Mexican tariffs will be phased out over 10 years, not fast enough for American producers.
 DEAL: The United States will open talks on Jan. 1 to speed elimination of Mexican tariffs.
 U.S. PRODUCTION: $ 8.5 billion
 
PRODUCT: North American Development Bank
 STATUS QUO: The Clinton Administration has set up a $450 million fund that would issue $2 billion in federally guaranteed bonds to help clean the U.S.-Mexico border.
 DEAL: The fund will become a $450 million bank, which will issue $3 billion in federally guaranteed bonds for community economic development projects in the United States and Mexico and enviromental cleanup on the border.

HEADLINE: SHELL DELIVERING GASOLINE IN HAITI

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Nov. 16

 BODY:
Four weeks after the United Nations imposed an oil embargo in an attempt to force Haiti's military rulers to return the nation to democracy, the Shell Oil Company resumed gasoline deliveries today. Diplomats said the move could prolong the country's political crisis by up to six weeks.
After hearing an announcement Monday night on radio that Shell would resume sales of its gasoline reserves in Haiti, some drivers spent the night parked in front of stations to guarantee they would be among the first served when the pumps opened. 
 The streets of the capital were clogged with traffic this morning as motorists jockeyed for position at the pumps. At one station drivers formed a line more than a mile long.
The United Nations halted all oil sales to Haiti on Oct. 18 after the country's military leaders refused to resign to allow the return of Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The embargo has been backed by United States Navy ships, which have turned around ships trying to deliver banned goods to Haiti.
An earlier embargo against Haiti was lifted after a United Nations-mediated accord was signed in New York by Father Aristide and Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, who overthrew him in a coup in September 1991. Under the terms of the accord, the military leadership was supposed to step down in exchange for an amnesty and Father Aristide was scheduled to return on Oct. 30.
 
Prices Haves Soared
 When the second embargo was imposed, foreign oil companies halted all deliveries to their stations although they were estimated to have about six weeks of reserves already in the country. Since then, prices have skyrocketed, and many businesses have closed. Gasoline has been selling for $10 a gallon on the black market.
Shell's surprise decision to begin selling its gasoline reserves came after lawyers for Haiti's petroleum distributors threatened to ask the army's help in forcing the three foreign oil companies in Haiti -- Shell, Texaco and Exxon -- to distribute their reserves.
The three companies had refused to release the stocks, saying that to do so would breach the embargo. But renewed threats that company employees would be arrested if the gasoline was not released appear to have persuaded Shell to resume deliveries.
Diplomats say Tuesday's move will drag out the country's political crisis by giving Father Aristide's opponents, especially the military, more time.
Officials of Haiti's civilian Government, which was appointed in anticipation of Father Aristide's return, were also dismayed by Shell's decision. "This will just prolong the crisis," an aide to Prime Minister Robert Malval said.
Oil company executives refused to say how long the reserves will last, but analysts estimate that there could be enough gasoline to last six weeks. Texaco and Exxon are expected to follow Shell's example and release their reserves later this week.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Clinton California Conundrum for '96

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
For President Clinton, California's beleaguered economy presents two riddles, with heavy political implications for 1996.
First, how can his Administration help pull California, with its 54 electoral votes, out of the economic abyss as Pentagon cutbacks continue to drag that state down? And how can the Administration mount a plan to rescue California without having other states accuse it of favoritism? 
 For months the Administration has wrestled with these conundrums, facing complaints from California that it is not doing enough, while New York and other states suggest it is doing too much.
 
Danger Signs for '96
 If President Clinton does not find a solution that will satisfy both California and the rest of the country, it could spell big trouble for him in a 1996 re-election race.
"There's no question that if California's recession goes on to 1996, it's going to be very difficult for Clinton," said Mervyn Field, a veteran California pollster. "It would be death to him if he didn't try to help California. It could make or break his chances in 1996."
Trying to please all sides, the Administration has tentatively settled on a strategy: it will move heaven and earth to help California's economy while staying within budget limitations but not play favorites.
In other words, the Administration is giving California heaps of money to convert military complexes to civilian uses, is gearing up to expand small business loans for the state and is making sure California gets a steady flow of Federal projects.
 
Balancing Act
 But Clinton Administration officials insist they are not favoring California, noting that Connecticut, New York and other states are also benefiting from such programs.
Rather, they say the Administration is treating California like a laboratory, where it will test programs for hard-hit areas that might then be used in other states.
At the moment, the Administration's evolving strategy is not pleasing anyone entirely.
"The Administration isn't doing enough," said Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat. "The Administration can't be afraid of what the other states think. California's unemployment rate is 9.8 percent, 3 percent over the nation's. We're the state hit hardest by defense downsizing. We've had every problem: the fires, the riots, the earthquake."
 
Rail Project Urged
 Reminding the White House of California's political influence, Senator Feinstein has been urging the President to spend 50 percent of the planned $19.5 billion in military conversion funds on her state, up from the current 20 percent. She also wants the Administration to finance a high-speed railroad through California and to favor it over other states in awarding Federal projects.
But Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat who is co-chairman of a coalition of 92 Northeast and Midwest House members, has warned the President that there will be a political price to pay if he lavishes goodies on California at the expense of other states.
Ms. Kaptur sees no reason why the Government should do somersaults to help California. She contends that Washington ignored the Midwest when it was down and out in the 1980's and glamorous California was living high on the hog.
 
Say No to Favoritism
 "It's wrong to favor one region over another," she said. "We have lots of people who lost their jobs in the private sector, and we don't see why, just because they don't come from the defense sector, they deserve less attention."
For the Administration, the question is not favoring one region over another but figuring out what should be done for the nation's most depressed state. They say Mr. Clinton's help for California is consistent with American tradition, like President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, which largely aimed to help backward Appalachia. Besides, Administration officials reason, for a state that grew fat by building missiles and jet fighters, it is only fair for Washington to lend a hand when Pentagon spending cuts are the main force pulling that state down.
"The economic situation in California didn't happen overnight. There has been a downward spiral that's been frightening, particularly in Southern California," said Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who was named by President Clinton to oversee efforts to help California. "One-eighth of the nation's people live there, it represents one-seventh of the gross domestic product. It was the judgment of the President that California needed some concentrated attention."
 
Frequent Traveler
 It has got attention galore. Mr. Brown has been to California 11 times since March. The President's order to remove export controls on $37 billion in high-tech goods is a boon to Silicon Valley. California firms and schools won 22 percent of the $140 million that the Government awarded last month for projects to adapt military technologies to civilian use. The Government has given California two of the nation's four centers aimed at promoting high-tech exports, and it plans to open a special center in Los Angeles to help minority business.
Last month, the Government picked Stanford University over Cornell for a $36 million high-energy physics laboratory, a decision that caused New York's two most powerful Democrats -- Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan -- to complain to the White House.
"We want fair federalism for both states," Mr. Cuomo said at the time. (Some White House officials admit that whenever they are about to take a pro-California action, they first ask themselves how New York's Governor will react.)
 
And Santa Isn't Finished
 But Mr. Clinton has more in his Christmas stocking for California. It is due to receive a disproportionate share of money from new programs to retrain workers and finance environmental technologies.
To ward off charges that all these efforts amount to favoritism, Administration officials assert that the California aid is in many ways a Federally sponsored experiment that can show other states how to convert from military to civilian production. The idea, officials say, is to form a public-private partnership to lift California, especially by spurring defense conversion and small business.
"What we do successfully we hope will be replicated around the country," said Lawrence Parks, a special policy adviser to Secretary Brown.

HEADLINE: Giuliani and 4 County Chiefs Form a Regional Alliance

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani and the executives of four counties around New York City announced yesterday that they would forge an alliance to work together on regional issues from economic development to transportation and, for the first time in memory, prepare a common agenda to take to Albany and Washington.
Mr. Giuliani and the top officeholders of Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland Counties -- all of them Republicans -- portrayed the alliance as a potential boon for the entire region's economy. Its purpose, they said, would be to rise above the local interests that have created deep rifts and, on occasion, open hostilities between the city and its suburbs. 
 "There are differences between and among us," Mr. Giuliani said yesterday after meeting with the four county executives for more than an hour at his transition headquarters on Madison Avenue. "But they are overshadowed and overwhelmed by the agreements that exist and the things we need for our counties."
It remains to be seen, however, whether yesterday's spirit of collaboration can overcome the divisions, particularly on such issues as the formula for state aid to schools, which the city has long argued favors suburban school districts.
 
Competition for Jobs
 And whatever the public platitudes and the common goals, the alliance will inevitably find itself strained when, say, a major corporation threatens to move its headquarters and 500 or so jobs from Manhattan to Westchester.
"There's no question that there will be some areas of disagreement," Mr. Giuliani said, "but even then, our remaining together and working together makes the most sense."
The five executives -- Mr. Giuliani, Thomas S. Gulotta of Nassau, Robert J. Gaffney of Suffolk, Andrew J. O'Rourke of Westchester and C. Scott Vanderhoef of Rockland -- will meet quarterly.
Representing 62 percent of the state's population, the alliance could have considerable sway in Albany, if the disparate governments can agree on a common agenda. It could also become a political challenge to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the State Legislature.
 
Political Move Denied
 At a news conference after yesterday's meeting, the executives maintained their alliance was not a political one -- even though their elections mean that come Jan. 1, for the first time in a generation, the chiefs of New York's downstate counties will all be Republicans.
Mr. Cuomo, who was traveling to Buffalo yesterday, was not available to comment, but a spokesman, Charles Porcari, said the Governor hoped the alliance would force action on issues long stalled in the divided Legislature, primarily his proposal to take over local Medicaid costs in return for a percentage of local sales tax.
Some of the common interests mentioned at yesterday's news conference included reducing the state's hotel tax and persuading the State Legislature to help pay for the programs it mandates for local governments.
The executives also said they would join together in planning policies that affect them all, including transportation, the environment and economic development, though they did not offer details of how they would do so.
 
Transition Presses On
 Meanwhile, Mr. Giuliani's transition team continued to prepare lists of candidates for police commissioner and budget director, two positions the Mayor-elect has described as his top priorities.
Among the candidates who reportedly have emerged for budget director are Dall W. Forsythe, the former state budget director under Governor Cuomo; Mark V. Shaw, who is the City Council's budget director; Abe Lackman, a budget analyst for the State Senate, and Elinor B. Bachrach, deputy state comptroller for New York City.
But when Mr. Forsythe, now a lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, was contacted by members of the transition team yesterday, he took himself out of contention.
The transition also announced that Mr. Giuliani's public inauguration will take place on Jan. 2 on the steps of City Hall. Inaugurations have traditionally been held on Jan. 1, but this year the inauguration would have fallen on a Saturday, meaning Orthodox Jews could not attend.
Mr. Giuliani, who received strong support from conservative Jewish voters, has said he wanted to schedule the inauguration so that Jewish supporters could attend.

HEADLINE: Poll Says People Expect Delay on the Health Plan

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
The American public doubts that Congress can pass health care legislation, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll shows. But, at least for now, the public blames the issue's complexities, not the lawmakers.
The poll showed that 57 percent of the public expected Congress to fail to pass a health care plan by the end of next year as President Clinton hopes, while 36 percent said they thought it would succeed. 
 But these views are unusually tolerant of Congress. Of those who expect Congress to fail, two-thirds said the reason was that the issue is too complicated. They numbered three times as many as those who said it was an inherent inability of Congress to solve important problems.
And among those who expected some plan to emerge from Congress on the White House schedule, about two-fifths said the lawmakers would improve on the Clinton plan; about one-third said they would make it worse.
Those signs of public amiability toward Capitol Hill may be short-lived, however. Fifteen percent of the public -- more than for any other issue with a specific legislative solution -- regards health care as the nation's most important problem, and only one-fourth of the public said it approved of how Congress was generally handling its job.
 
Congressional Motivations
 And the public, by an overwhelming 78 to 14 percent, said it believed that generally when Congress fails to pass legislation, the cause is selfish political reasons, not honest disagreement about policy.
The poll also made clear that President Clinton's advocacy of a plan for universal health insurance remains a prime political asset for him. His overall approval rating in the latest poll, conducted by telephone with 1,334 adults from Thursday through Sunday, improved to 46 percent, the best recorded in these polls since June. Forty-one percent disapproved of his performance. The margin of sampling error in all three polls was plus or minus three percentage points.
Mr. Clinton's handling of health care was approved by 49 percent of the public in the latest poll, and disapproved by 37 percent. That was distinctly better than the 38 percent who said they liked his handling of the economy or the 38 percent who approved of his performance in foreign policy. Because of its promise of universal coverage that could not be lost, his health care plan was favored by the poll's respondents despite fears that it would raise their own taxes and despite doubts that it would improve their own health care.
A similar plurality, 45 percent, said his plan would make health care in the United States better, while 27 percent said care would be made worse. Opposition has risen slightly from that shown in a poll taken just before he announced the program to a joint session of Congress on Sept. 22. In that survey, 46 percent said the plan would make health care better and 20 percent said it would make it worse.
One major political attack against Mr. Clinton's plan has been the contention that it would promote managed health care in a way that would deny Americans the right to choose their own doctors.
 
Divergence of Views
 The poll suggested that this argument was not widely accepted. While the survey indicated that 73 percent of Americans have their own doctor, only 15 percent of the public said they believed they would be unable to keep seeing that doctor if the President's plan was enacted. That 15 percent, mostly Republican, also felt that the plan was not fair to them personally and would be bad for health care generally.
Health care clearly remains an advantage not only for the President but also for the Democratic Party. Forty-eight percent of the public said Democrats were more likely than Republicans to improve the health care system. Republicans were the only significant group of respondents to disagree, by 50 percent to 22 percent.
Sixty-five percent said yes when asked, "Do you think Bill Clinton cares about the needs and problems of people like yourself?" Thirty percent said he did not.
Besides the traditionally supportive demographic groups, like blacks, union members and the poor, majorities of several groups generally dubious about the Clinton Presidency, like Republicans, conservatives and white men, felt that Mr. Clinton cared about people like them.
The public is also impressed with the health care plan's chief public advocate, Hillary Rodham Clinton. Forty-five percent said they had a favorable view of her, while 21 percent had an unfavorable opinion. That is as high a favorable rating as these Times/CBS News Polls have recorded for her, although far less than the 81 percent with a favorable view of Barbara Bush in March 1992.

HEADLINE: Chicken Shop Selling Guns, Officials Say

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Roberto Pennyfeather didn't know about guns or drugs being sold at Mama's Fried Chicken in the Bronx. But then, like most of his neighbors, he didn't want to know.
"You just knew from who was around at night that it was a dangerous place," said Mr. Pennyfeather, who lives around the corner from Mama's, in East Tremont. "I don't ask too many questions." 
 The true business of Mama's, law-enforcement officials charged yesterday, was that of a supermarket in New York City's vast subterranean economy of destruction, operating virtually in the shadow of a junior high school. On Monday the chicken stand's owner, Fareedullah Nawabi, was arrested and charged with selling 59 unregistered firearms, 234 rounds of ammunition, a pound of cocaine and some heroin to undercover officers over a three-month period. When he was arrested, the police said, five more guns were confiscated at the store.
Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, said at a news conference that Mama's was a "a guns-for-order business with takeout service," specializing in the most popular weapons of the street -- 9-millimeter and .380-caliber semiautomatic pistols and .357 Magnum and .38-caliber revolvers. More exotic hardware, like a Calico pistol with a 50-round drum magazine, was also for sale, he said.
 
Received First Tips
 The investigation into Mama's was done by the police and the Manhattan District Attorney's office, which received the first tips of the gun sales in 1991, and the city's Office of Special Narcotics and the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
Mr. Nawabi, who lives in Flushing, Queens, with his father and sister, faces an array of charges that could net him a sentence of 25 years to life in prison if convicted. He pleaded not guilty yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, and Acting Justice Leslie C. Synder ordered him held without bail.
"I'm confident that when all the facts are in, Mr. Nawabi will be exonerated," said his lawyer, Paul S. Brenner.
 
Political Asylum
 Mr. Brenner said that before coming to the United States in 1989, Mr. Nawabi, 23, was one of the Mujahadeen, the rebels who battled Soviet troops and the Soviet-backed Government of Afghanistan for more than a decade. "I understand he and his family were given political asylum here," Mr. Brenner said.
A second suspect, Russel Thompson of the Bronx, was arrested in Ohio, where investigators said many of the guns were first sold, but officials would not say what he was being charged with.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said Mr. Nawabi, an Afghan national known as Mohammed, bragged to an undercover investigator that he had sold a million guns from Mama's. "Obviously, we have to give him a little leeway for braggadocio," Mr. Kelly said, "but this is a significant case, a major case, as far as gun dealing in the Bronx and the city of New York."
Officials said Mr. Nawabi's clientele were criminals willing to pay a premium for hard-to-trace weapons. A police lieutenant, Kenneth McCann, said undercover officers paid a total of $26,000 for guns with a retail value of $11,000.
Mama's, on Boston Road at Seabury Place, sits at the southern end of a busy strip of delicatessens and groceries, within 100 yards of two churches, in an area dominated by five- and six-story apartment houses.
The residents, mostly black and Hispanic, say the neighborhood has rebounded from its nadir in the late -1970's. They point to a few dozen neat single-family homes with well-kept yards, where 10 years ago there were abandoned and fire-gutted buildings, and to Public School 98 across the street from Mama's, which, after being shuttered for a couple of years, reopened as the Foreign Language and Global Studies magnet school.
Still the fear that pervades so many of the city's neighborhoods has not entirely abated, nor has the sense that too much inquiry is a dangerous thing. Many people who live and work nearby say they knew that something was wrong at Mama's, which was open around the clock, but were not quite sure what.
Kosa, a teen-age girl who refused to give her last name, said, "There was always drug dealers sitting in there, and everybody knew it."
 
'Don't Want to Know'
 Angelo Sanchez, who works at a carburetor repair shop half a block away, said he had often wondered why Mama's was bustling at 3 A.M. But when pressed about what he might have seen, he said, "Sometimes you don't want to know."
Lieutenant McCann said investigators spent nearly two years trying to arrange an introduction to meet Mr. Nawabi and win his confidence. The first purchase of two handguns by an undercover investigator was made last August through the restaurant's drive-up window, he said.
The fast-food business served as little more than a front for the illegal trade, the lieutenant said. In the 11 weeks that law-enforcement officials had the restaurant under surveillance, he said, "I don't think they sold $50 worth of chicken."

HEADLINE: U.S. Survey Underestimated The Jobless Rate for Women

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 16

 BODY:
The Government has been substantially underestimating unemployment for at least a decade or more, particularly among women, the Labor Department reported today.
As part of the biggest revamping in the 53-year history of the Government survey that determines the nation's official jobless rate, researchers at the Labor Department have discovered a bias in the survey under which many women who were seeking jobs were erroneously described as homemakers, and therefore not counted as being in the work force. 
 Under the redesigned survey, which tries to wipe out any bias, the nation's average unemployment rate in the 12 months through August was 7.6 percent, a half-point above the 7.1 percent that the department had reported. The rate for women was 6.8 percent, rather than 6.0 percent; for men, the figure went to 6.9 percent from 6.7.
 
 
Discouraged Workers
 The Labor Department also discovered that besides undercounting jobless women, it was also miscounting laid off and so-called discouraged workers.
The redesigned questionnaire, which was tested in parallel with the present system for 12 months ending in August, will be used officially by the Labor Department beginning in January. If the higher jobless rates persist when the new survey takes effect, they could affect benefit programs like state unemployment compensation systems that are tied to joblessness figures.
Officials at the Labor Department said they had suspected for some time that the survey, whose last major revision was in 1967, was failing to reflect changes in American society, such as the greater participation of women in the work force. But it took years to design the revision and begin to put it into effect.
The effort, begun in 1986 and costing $40 million, includes the collection of new data, rewording of questions, changes in definitions and computerization of the entire process, beginning with laptop computers that will soon be carried into households by interviewers.
The first results using the new system will be published in early February; the old survey will be calculated, but with sharply reduced samples.
Marvin Kosters, a labor specialist at the American Enterprise Institute and its director of economic policy studies, said, "It's essential to move toward the use of new technology even if it means we have a little discontinuity" in the statistics.
But he also said that the figures published today acted as a reminder of the "subjective" element in even the most sophisticated data, and he reserved judgment about specific changes.
Labor Department officials also cautioned against making too much of the experimental comparisons published today, since the monthly variations were great in the year they ran their test, the samples relatively small and interviewers were still becoming acquainted with the refined questions and their new technology.
Nonetheless, the differences pointed up in the experimental results are considered important both inside and outside the Labor Department. Private analysts who have followed the redesign process generally applauded the effort, and some expressed little surprise at the results.
"The academic work that preceded this was careful, thoughtful and completely nonpolitical," said H. Erich Heinemann, an economist and student of the figures who works at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, a securities house.
The redesign of the survey began with well-grounded suspicions that it was not capturing various shifts in American society and even, as in the case with the word "layoff," shifts in word usage.
Since the updating in 1967, the department said today, "there have been many societal changes, such as the continuing growth in service-sector employment; the more prominent role of women, particularly mothers, in the labor force, and shifts in the nature of employment, including more part-time work and less permanent attachment of employees to their employers."
One of the main deficiencies in the present survey, department officials said, was the first question interviewers asked householders, whether by visit or by telephone.
If a man responded, the interviewer typically asked whether he was "working or something else" during the period under survey while a woman was more likely to be asked whether she was "keeping house or something else."
 
 
'Tailoring' of Questions
 This bias due to wording and the "tailoring" of early questions "has caused some unemployed women to be misclassified as not in the labor force," the department found in its studies. This held the unemployment rate down since one must be actively seeking work to be considered unemployed.
Similarly, the word layoff had traditionally been used by respondents to describe a temporary period of not working when they expected to be called back to a job. But the Labor Department in recent years has increasingly found people using it even when they had no expectation of going back.
Thus the revamped survey abandons what the department called its probably "most notoriously complex" question: "Did you have a job or business from which you were temporarily absent or on layoff last week?" Replacing it are simpler, more straightforward questions, including whether the worker has been given a date to return.
The redesign of the survey, initiated when Janet L. Norwood was Commissioner of Labor Statistics, was inspired by a Presidential commission headed by Sar Levitan, a labor economist at George Washington University. In 1979, the commission recommended changes in the measurement of discouraged workers.
Such workers are those who have dropped out of the labor force because they believe a job search would be in vain, and so they are no longer counted as unemployed.
 
 
New Calculations
 Under the redesign, less than half as many workers will be classified as discouraged because of a new requirement that they have searched for work within the last year and are available to take a job. The change would tend to raise the unemployment rate because these workers would be listed as part of the work force, but unemployed.
This figure, which has been calculated quarterly, will now come out every month.
Among the other improvements produced by the redesigned survey will be better tracking of people over time to get data on movements between jobs, and more specific questioning of part-time workers about their desire for full-time work and their availability to take it if offered.
The parallel, or experimental, survey found a larger proportion of people working part time by choice than did the existing survey.
Respondents will now be permitted to disclose their pay by month or annually or in some other way, rather than having to specify, perhaps roughly, in weekly terms. And the inquiry into time worked has been sharpened to obtain actual hours on the job, avoiding a generality that might have been based on someone's usual schedule.
 
 
Improving Accuracy
 Spells of joblessness can be given in either weeks or months, improving accuracy and, according to the experimental figures, raising both the median and mean durations.
Full computerization of the process, the Department also said, permits more contingent questioning, the retrieval and verification of data from a preceding month's interview. This reduces repetitive questions and provides checks for consistency.
The department conducts its survey of households -- called the Current Population Survey -- to cover the week containing the 12th of each month. About 60,000 respondents are included, with households interviewed for four straight months after which they are out of the survey for eight months before coming back in for a final four months. Interviews are conducted at the respondent's home in the first and fifth months of their total of eight in the survey.
The department's other employment survey, which measures the number of payroll jobs, is unaffected by the changes in the Current Population Survey.

HEADLINE: Center for Drug Intelligence Opens, But Some Ask if It Is Really Needed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHNSTOWN, Pa.

 BODY:
The National Drug Intelligence Center, the Government's newest agency for combating drug traffickers, opened here on Aug. 9 and is still dealing with its first puzzle: finding a mission.
At the dedication of the $50 million center in August, Attorney General Janet Reno said it would coordinate intelligence from rival Federal law-enforcement agencies. She called it a symbol of the Clinton Administration's effort to eliminate waste and inefficiency in the fragmented $13 billion-a-year fight against drugs. 
 Ms. Reno read a letter from President Clinton saying, "This center marks a crucial turning point in our efforts to combat the devastating effects of drug trafficking."
 
'Pork-Barrel Politics'
 But in the view of many drug experts and former anti-drug officials, the Administration, which played no role in creating the Johnstown center, selected a political boondoggle as symbol of reform.
They say that the agency, which is administered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, duplicates the work of 19 other drug intelligence centers around the country and that it cannot function effectively in this western Pennsylvania mill town, 182 miles from Washington. For these critics, the center is a wasteful display of political patronage that primarily benefits the constituents of one Democratic Congressman, Representative John P. Murtha.
"It's an egregious example of pork-barrel politics," said Peter B. Bensinger, a Chicago consultant on drug abuse who was administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration from 1976 to 1981.
At a news conference after the dedication ceremony, Ms. Reno dodged questions about why the center was situated in Johnstown. When reporters asked Mr. Murtha the same question, he replied, "Because that's where I wanted it."
 
'Real Asset to Our Fight'
 Presidents, members of Congress and lobbyists pay special attention to Mr. Murtha because, as chairman of the House Defense Appropriations subcommittee, he has an important role in drafting the military's budget -- $263 billion this year -- and saying where it is spent.
The Congressman defended the center in a recent interview. "The more I look at it," he said, "the more convinced I am that this thing will be a real asset to our fight against drugs. Of course, we'll have to wait and see."
Since 1968, the Federal Government has undertaken a dozen efforts to coordinate drug intelligence activities but has achieved little success, according to a Federal audit released in April. The audit, conducted for Congress by the General Accounting Office, characterized the drug intelligence network as lacking focus and having "unnecessary overlap and duplication."
The Federal auditors found, for example, that 4 of the 19 intelligence centers monitor the same air traffic near Mexico, and that 3 centers monitor drug traffickers in the same parts of Central America. Four other centers generate information about long-term trends in drug trafficking. The Johnstown center, the 20th drug intelligence center, is the fifth performing this kind of strategic work.
 
Some Overlap With El Paso
 The center's 130-person staff includes about 60 new employees from Johnstown and Washington and about 70 agents and analysts who are on leave from a dozen other departments and agencies, including the Defense Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Internal Revenue Service. The center expects to have 211 employees, but it does not yet have an estimated annual budget.
The Johnstown office is most similar to one run by the D.E.A. in El Paso. Though both agencies were set up to encourage cooperation, they are likely to compete against each other, Mr. Bensinger said. "Johnstown will have to come up with something El Paso doesn't do," he said, "and that means that people will be spending more time talking about their roles, turf and data bases than they will spend on the Colombian cartels."
Douglas A. Ball, an F.B.I. special agent who is director of the Johnstown center, says that there is no overlap and that his center is doing valuable work.
The Bush Administration proposed a National Drug Intelligence Center in 1990. How the center would operate was never precisely defined, but it was supposed to be the national clearinghouse for drug intelligence.
John P. Walters, who was President George Bush's acting drug czar in 1990 and 1991 and who helped plan the center, said in an interview that the Johnstown office was a complete distortion of the original plan. That plan called for the center to be situated within the Department of Justice in Washington, Mr. Walters said, so that it would be near the headquarters of the F.B.I., the D.E.A., the C.I.A., the Customs Bureau and other Federal agencies that track drug trafficking.
 
Influential Democrat
 "It was to bring together anti-drug agencies' senior leadership and encourage them to share their agencies' most jealously guarded intelligence information about the highest level of drug traffickers," Mr. Walters said. Agencies rarely share such information, he said, because they do not want to share the credit with other agencies in making splashy arrests, which generate publicity, build reputations and justify budget increases.
The original idea died for lack of money and interest. Enter Mr. Murtha, a 60-year-old, 10-term Congressman from Johnstown, a city of 35,000 people that is surrounded by abandoned steel mills and coal mines and has a 12 percent unemployment rate. The city's most famous moment was a disaster: the 1889 flood of the Conemaugh River, which killed 2,209 residents.
Though he is considered one of the most influential Democrats on Capitol Hill, Mr. Murtha is not well known outside Washington and his district. Yet he is not shy about his political power, in public or in private. That was evident in a 1980 videotape made by undercover F.B.I. agents conducting the Abscam sting operation that ultimately sent a half-dozen Congressmen to prison for bribery and conspiracy. "I've got as much influence in that goddamned Congress with the leadership and the White House as anybody in Congress," Mr. Murtha was recorded as telling some undercover F.B.I. agents. Mr. Murtha, who was then a member of the House Ethics Committee, was secretly videotaped as he declined a $50,000 bribe, saying, "It might be that I would change my mind some day."
Mr. Murtha, who asserted that he was only trying to bring investment to his district, was not charged with any crime, and the House Ethics Committee absolved him of any wrongdoing.
 
Bring Money to His District
 Mr. Murtha lists no national achievements on his resume, which reads like an economic development brochure for the 12th Congressional District here. He takes credit for bringing many hundreds of millions of Federal dollars to his district for projects like highways, a prison, the expansion of the Johnstown-Cambria County Airport, an armed forces reserve center, a Marine helicopter base, three military research centers and a historic district of refurbished mills and mines.
In 1990, Mr. Murtha revived the proposal for a national drug intelligence center, but in name only. Instead of consolidating and coordinating all of the Government's drug intelligence activities, as the Bush Administration's plan called for, Mr. Murtha's center is a much more limited operation, one that analyzes information on relatively few projects. And he placed it in Johnstown, not Washington -- a cost-saving measure, Mr. Murtha said, because rents are lower here.
No Congressional hearings were held on Mr. Murtha's plan; he created the center by inserting a brief amendment into a defense appropriations bill just before it became law. The center was started with $10 million and given $40 million more last year to carry it through September 1995.
The center is situated in a former department store in downtown Johnstown. Its officials acknowledge the agency's political roots, its inconvenient location and its foggy mission, but they say they are making the best of an awkward situation.
"When I came here in 1992, I was handed very general parameters and guidance with which to work from," said Mr. Ball, the center's director. The center has just completed research on organized crime and narcotics trafficking by Russians, Nigerians and Jamaicans, he said.
Mr. Ball said the agency was trying to overcome problems posed by the Johnstown location by leasing an office in McLean, Va., for $144,000 a year, but financing for that office is uncertain.

HEADLINE: Theater Owners Battle Planned Disney Leap Into 42d Street

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Crying economic foul, Broadway's theater owners have joined to oppose a plan by the Walt Disney Company to take over the landmark New Amsterdam Theater as part of the rehabilitation of West 42d Street.
Because reconstruction of the New Amsterdam might be publicly subsidized, Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, said Disney would gain an unfair advantage in offering "legitimate attractions that would otherwise be presented in non-subsidized theaters" -- in other words, those owned by the Shubert, Jujamcyn and Nederlander concerns, which control virtually every legitimate Broadway house. 
 Little is known at this time about Disney's plan, other than that it involves live entertainment. Officials might offer a low-interest construction loan to help rebuild the New Amsterdam, which has retained much of its Beaux-Arts grandeur even after decades of neglect. Disney is expected to make a major financial commitment to the project.
Mr. Schoenfeld spoke against the Disney plan Monday night at a hearing by the New York State Urban Development Corporation that also addressed several key amendments to the 42d Street project. Yesterday, he refused to elaborate.
Under the original redevelopment plans, construction was to have begun this year on four office towers at the crossroads of 42d Street, Broadway and Seventh Avenue.
The amendments would permit the developers, the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty, to defer construction of the towers until the real estate market improves. In the meantime, they would finance the interim rehabilitation of existing buildings, following design guidelines that are meant to encourage splashy facades, dazzling lights and jumbo signs.
 
Theater Plan Hailed
The amendments would also do the following:
* Relieve Prudential and Park Tower of their obligation to contribute $91 million to the renovation of the Times Square subway station.
* Relax restrictions on the future use of the historic theaters between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, permitting any of them to become a movie house.
* Incorporate the New Amsterdam Theater into the overall development project.
There was almost universal support at the hearing for the rehabilitation plan as well as the renovation of the New Amsterdam Theater. But there were also numerous calls to make the interim plan permanent and to scrap the office towers.
Opponents also argued that the revised 42d Street project is so different from the one approved by the Board of Estimate in 1984 that it would have to go through full city review again.
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan said, "The U.D.C., in my view, no longer has legitimate authority to act on this plan."
But Rebecca Robertson, the president of the 42d Street Development Project Inc., a subsidiary of the Urban Development Corporation, replied that the "long-term plan is pretty much as approved and amended over the years."

HEADLINE: Support for Trade Pact Pushes Dow Over 3,700

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks surged late yesterday after the White House said it had lined up nearly enough votes to win approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement in today's vote in the House of Representatives.
News of the growing support for the trade pact also helped push up the dollar against most major currencies yesterday. 
 With stocks mixed and trading lackluster for most of the day, the late news moved the Dow Jones industrial average above 3,700 for the first time to a new high of 3,710.77, up 33.25 points. The previous closing high was set on Nov. 2, when the Dow finished at 3,697.64.
"The institutionals remain rich in cash and with interest rates still relatively low, the institutionals will want to spend this cash before the Nafta vote," said Lawrence R. Rice, chief market strategist for Josephthal, Lyon & Ross. "As the days pass, it is looming more in favor for the Clinton Administration."
But, Mr. Rice added, "even with a pro-Nafta vote, there is still some caution in the market, for historically profits are made by buying into anticipation and selling on news." Approval of the agreement could bring buyers into the market early tomorrow, but any rally could be short lived.
Mr. Rice said yesterday's rally was mainly limited to blue-chip stocks. "Volume was heavy, but it has been heavier, with the breadth unimpressive," he said. "Today could bring more volatility and more news on votes and more predictions."
Some of the large capitalization stocks that make up the Dow and helped propel it to a new high included General Electric, up 2 1/4, to 96 1/2; its movement accounting for 14 percent of the Dow's shift. Other Dow components ending with gains of better than a point included McDonald's, up 1 3/4, to 57; United Technologies, 1 7/8, to 65 3/4; I.B.M., 1 3/4, to 52 3/4; 3M, 1 5/8, to 107 1/8; General Motors, 1 1/4, to 52 3/4; Sears, Roebuck, 1 1/2, to 58 1/2, and Merck, 1 1/8, to 33 7/8.
Analysts at MMS International noted that the broader market has been weak the last two sessions and the decline in the Dow utility average, which rebounded yesterday from a 10-month low on Monday, has been particular noteworthy. They said the utility average's persistent retreat reflected the change in market assumptions regarding the direction of interest rates. For most of the three-year bull market, traders have operated under the assumption that interest rates were heading lower. But signs are emerging that the economy is gaining steam.
"Many stocks that have been out of favor with investors recently were up yesterday," Mr. Rice said. "There were the pharmaceuticals, the autos and some computer issues."
The broad market indexes, however, seemed to suggest that many investors were still not committed ahead of today's vote on the trade agreement. And the bond market did little to move equities, as those investors also awaited the outcome of the vote.
Volume on the Big Board totaled nearly 304 million shares, an improvement over Monday's 251 million. The spread between gaining issues and losing issues was close, with advancing stocks only moving out in front near the end of the session, 1,075 to 1,003.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 2.99 points, to 466.74, while the New York Stock Exchange composite gained 1.22, to 257.80. On the other side of yesterday's market, the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.76 point, to 771.69; the American Stock Exchange composite fell 3.09 points, to 474.73, and the Russell 2000 closed at 255.42, down 1.05.
Bolstered by solid gains in overseas markets and an early firmness in the bond market, stocks opened yesterday on a bullish note, but indexes proceeded to give back much of their opening gains amid lingering anxieties over the trade accord.
Traders had expected limited market activity because of the uncertainty and the prospects that the bidding for Paramount might not go higher, but news about a closer vote seemed to make things livelier.
Birinyi Associates, which tracks large program trades, clocked two buy programs, one close to 1 P.M., which drove the Dow up 3.63 points, and the other at 3:24 P.M., which moved the Dow up 9.22 points, from 3,692 to 3,701, with the market rallying shortly after.
 
G.M. Pension Move
 General Motors, up on Monday because of a strong monthly sales report, was up again yesterday on reports that it was considering putting stock into underfunded pension plans to reduce their obligation.
Tower Air, which went public yesterday with an initial public offering of 3.75 million shares at 15 1/2 a share, eased 1/2.
After a rating change by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette to moderately attractive from buy, Caterpillar, declined 1 1/8, to 88 3/4.
Perfumania, which operates 73 retail stores selling perfumes at a discount, was up 1 1/4, to 7 1/2, on news that it was discussing a possible merger with a unit of Revlon.
Elsewhere, traders said Timberland fell 7 1/8, to 71 5/8, after an article in Barron's noted that 1993 sales could reach $425 million, but the stock may be overvalued -- trading at twice sales, 7.8 times book value and 40 times earnings.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Traders Await Vote on Trade Pact

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds and notes were little changed yesterday in trading ahead of today's vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement in the House of Representatives.
The outlook for approval of the trade treaty linking the United States, Canada and Mexico is still unclear. But some traders said yesterday that they were a little more confident that the Clinton Administration could win approval. A vote is not expected until after trading is finished in New York today. 
 In a separate development, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that it had requested data on the trading of the 30-year bond from the primary dealers that are at the center of trading in the bond market.
The request confirms that the Fed is looking into what the market already knows: there is a shortage of the 30-year bond, which could be pushing price artifically higher. What could happen next is that the Treasury could decide to issue more of the same bond in an effort to relieve the shortage. The speculation in the market yesterday was that this increase could occur even before the next scheduled 30-year auction, which is in Feburary.
The problem with the bond has been created in part by the Treasury itself, which decided to cut the annual issuance of 30-year bonds by about 40 percent and switch to just two bond auctions a year instead of four.
In trading in the secondary market, the price of the 6.25 percent 30-year bond slipped 4/32 as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.16 percent, from 6.15 percent on Monday.
Among shorter-term securities, the price of the 3.875 percent two-year note rose 1/32 as the yield slipped to 4.04 percent from 4.06 percent.
Matthew Alexy, the government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said that the trading of the last three sessions may have indicated that traders and investors have done all the selling they are going to do because they are worried that the economy will accelerate to about a 4 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter.
He said that this appeared clear from the fact that the market had not sold off further in the face of the healthy October retail sales data reported Friday and the strong rise in industrial production last month reported Monday.
The policy setting body of the Federal Reserve Board -- the Open Market Committee -- meet in Washington yesterday but the committee is not expected to make any changes in policy.
 
Other Bonds
 In the corporate bond market, investors lined up to buy an unfamiliar foreign name in the market and one that is a household name.
The new issuer is Guangdong International Trust and Investment, a Chinese economic development agency, which sold $150 million of of 10-year notes. The issue is a private placement, which means it is a foreign issue that has not met disclosure standards of the Securities and Exchange Commission and cannot be sold to the general public. Only qualified institutional investors can purchase the issue.
While the lead underwriter, CS First Boston, is not allowed to comment on the issue, money managers said the Guangdong issue was priced to yield 6.775 percent, which was 115 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over the 10-year Treasury note.
The demand for the issue is another signal of the willingness of many investors to bet on the Chinese market as one of the best places to make money in the future. The flood of money into the Hong Kong stock market, which has been rushing to record highs recently, is another such signal. But some money managers said they were still unwilling to take the risk to buy China paper at the yield offered yesterday
The household name was J. C. Penney, which came to market with a total of $1 billion in notes and debentures. CS First Boston was also the lead underwriter.
J. C. Penney sold issues of $400 million in five year notes, $325 million in 10-year notes and $275 million is 30-year debentures. The five-year notes were priced to yield 5.44 percent, 45 basis points over the comparable Treasury note. The 10-year notes were priced to yield 6.22 percent, 57 basis points over the yield on the 10-year Treasury. The yield on the 30-year debentures was 7.14 percent, 73 basis points over the 7.25 percent 30-year bond due in Feburary 2023.
In the municipal bond market, New York City sold about $675 million of bonds to be used to pay off existing higher-interest loans. The lead underwriter was Goldman, Sachs & Company.
Because of a large amount of New York City and New York State paper headed to the market in the near future, the City had to raise the yields it was offering on notes and bonds maturing from the year 2007 on to attract buyers.
For example, the yield on the 10-year notes due in 2010 was raised to 6.00 percent from an initial pricing yesterday of 5.95 percent. Yields ranged from 3.90 percent in 1995 to 5.90 percent in 2007 and 6.03 percent in 2013.
The equivalent taxable yield for these issues in the 36 percent tax bracket is 6.09 percent, 9.22 percent and 9.42 percent, respectively.
Following are the results of the Governments auctions of one-year Treasury bills:

Dollar Higher as Optimism Rises on Trade Pact Chances

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most major currencies yesterday amid growing feeling that Congress would approve the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"The dollar's upside potential has become more favorable as we come down to the wire," said Frank Pusateri, a Bank of Boston vice president. "The closer we get to the vote, the more likely it seems that Nafta will pass." 
 The White House said that the gap between opponents and supporters of the trade pact had narrowed significantly and that the Administration was now within grasp of the 218 votes needed for passage.
"We are single digits close," a White House official said at a news briefing. "We have been narrowing the gap on this and I think we are just about even."
The House is scheduled to vote today on the trade agreement among the United States, Canada and Mexico.
In late New York trading, the dollar jumped to 1.7050 German marks, from 1.6918 marks Monday, after the Bundesbank lowered an interest rate. It also rose to 106.78 Japanese yen, from 106.74.
The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar also firmed as the treaty's chances appeared to improve, dealers said. The Canadian dollar rose despite disappointing news on Canada's budget gap.
Gold prices fell, with the December futures contract dropping $1.10, to $374.60 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement would be positive for the dollar, said Chuck Spence, senior dealer at Standard Chartered Bank in Los Angeles.
"Nafta will mean an important opening up of the North American market," he said. "And in the same way that people were bullish on Europe after the E.C. was established, they are now bullish on North America."
Moreover, the approval of the trade agreement "would be a feather in the hat of Clinton," which would increase confidence in the Government and its currency, Mr. Spence said.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4815, down from $1.4885 late Monday.

HEADLINE: A.M.A. Heralds a Genetics Revolution

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
CONVINCED that advances in molecular biology and molecular genetics are transforming the theory and practice of medicine, the American Medical Association is virtually shouting at the nation's doctors to pay attention.
It is publishing more than 150 articles on advances in molecular genetics in 11 medical journals today, devoting its resources to pointing out that the genetics revolution is well under way. 
 The barrage of articles "is an explosion, a culmination, a profound statement of the importance of this subject for the human condition," said Dr. George D. Lundberg, who is editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association, where some of the articles appeared, and editor in chief of the American Medical Association's scientific publications.
 
Wide Range of Issues
 The papers address subjects rangingfrom clinical applications for cancer, neurology, pathology and dermatology to issues in law and ethics. Researchers in every arena are quoted as saying that there is no turning back.
In the field of prenatal diagnosis, scientists are on the verge of testing fetal cells taken from a pregnant woman's blood. This blood test could allow them to find disorders like Down syndrome, for example, as early as 10 weeks into the pregnancy. In another journal article, Dr. Joe Leigh Simpson and Dr. Sherman Elias of the University of Tennessee noted that researchers were already able to pick fetal cells out of a pregnant woman's blood by identifying their molecular features, even when there was only one fetal cell for every 100 million maternal blood cells.
Gene therapy is also well on its way. Fifty-two gene therapy studies have already been approved in patients, according to an article by Dr. C. Thomas Caskey and his colleagues at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Gene therapy is being tested to correct inherited gene mutations that cause diseases like cystic fibrosis. It is also being tested to treat cancer, by making tumor cells more vulnerable to drugs or to being destroyed by the body's own immune system.
Genes for inherited diseases are being found at a dizzying rate, not only in disorders like Huntington's disease, where the inheritance is fairly straightforward, but in diseases with a much more complicated genetic pattern. Now, according to an article by Dr. James Gusella, a professor of genetics at Harvard University who is director of molecular neurogenetics at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, advances in genetics have made it feasible to find genes that predispose a carrier to common diseases like heart disease and mental disorders, manic depression and schizophrenia.
 
Threshold of Major Change
 "We are on the threshold of a big change, and a lot of ethical hassles," Dr. Gusella said.
In an editorial in today's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Jeanette M. Smith, a contributing editor, quoted Dr. Francis Crick, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, the genetic material, to explain how such a momentous change could have taken place almost imperceptibly. Dr. Crick's image was of pennies dropping one by one until, Dr. Crick said, "eventually, it all clicks."
To make clear what this means, Dr. Smith wrote, not since "the Dutch janitor and shopkeeper" Anton van Leeuwenhoek, and later the Royal Society, puzzled over the little animals in rain water "has the stage been set for as radical a rethinking of the causes of disease and disability as is now occurring in conjunction with the elucidation of the human genome."
"Just as inevitability of death by infectious disease was diminished through knowledge of cause and prevention," Dr. Smith continued, "we may now begin to lift the burden of devastating inherited conditions."
Each specialist whose article is being published today has a story to tell that makes Dr. Smith's point.
For example, Dr. Jeffrey Sklar, a professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School who was an author of one of the papers, said in an interview that he was seeing the beginning of marked changes in the way cancer was detected and diagnosed and in the advent of ways to predict who would get cancer in the first place.
Dr. Sklar, who is also the director of the division of molecular oncology at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said that tests using molecular biology could now address all the areas of pathology that had been addressed by conventional methods, but with much greater sensitivity. He said those areas include primary diagnosis (is the tumor malignant?); staging (how far has it spread?), and efficacy of treatment (how much was the cancer reduced?)
The conventional methods of pathologists were developed 100 years ago, Dr. Sklar said, and rely on changes in the shape and architecture of cells as indications of the presence of a malignancy. "There is nothing wrong with that," Dr. Sklar said. "It's a powerful method," he said, but there can be times when results are equivocal.
One example is in patients with cancers of white blood cells, like Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, where tumors can be hard to distinguish from normal cells. White blood cells routinely change their size and shape when they are fighting an infection. "They can get big and ugly looking as part of the normal changes they undergo," Dr. Sklar said.
In cancer, he added, "you can get cells that look exactly like that, but they are not responding to an antigen." Pathologists diagnose cancer by trying to decide whether all the suspicious cells appear to have evolved from a single cell, which would happen in a tumor, or whether they seem to be individual cells that are, together, fighting an infection.
"It's a subjective criterion," Dr. Sklar said, and so specialized a skill that pathologists from around the world routinely send their most troubling specimens to one of a dozen or so experts. Even so, Dr. Sklar said, these experts can disagree on whether a cancer is there.
Other ambiguities arise when doctors find a very small pocket of cells that appear to be malignant, raising the question whether they are normal cells that look abnormal because they are responding to something else in the body or whether they are cancer cells.
 
New Molecular Tests
 But to resolve such puzzles, within the last few years there has been a virtual explosion of molecular tests that can objectively determine whether cells are cancerous. The tests look for genetic changes and molecular markers that characterize particular tumor cells. Besides being precise, the tests are also exquisitely sensitive, Dr. Sklar said.
Conventional methods allow pathologists to see cancer cells that are present among normal cells in ratios of 1 in 10 or 1 in 100. The new tests, Dr. Sklar said, find cancer cells when the ratio is as low as 1 in a million.
Within the next two to three years, Dr. Sklar predicts, screening tests will have been developed to detect genetic predilections to colon and breast cancers. The colon cancer gene and the breast cancer gene are dominant, meaning that if an individual inherits a gene from either parent, the person is at risk for the cancer, and they have a high likelihood of producing cancer. They also are very common, Dr. Sklar said, occurring in about 1 in 200 people in the general population, making the cancers the most common inherited diseases. A few such tests are in use now for people with family histories of certain rare tumors, but, Dr. Sklar said, "we are really only beginning to see the tip of the iceberg."
Genetic screening tests for cancer should be of enormous benefit because they could alert those at risk to be screened routinely, to find cancers early, and they could allow researchers to test methods of preventing cancer more effectively by focusing on those likely to get the disease. But, Dr. Sklar warned, the tests will also "raise all sorts of issues -- privacy, insurability, how widespread screening should be, the economic impact of doing broad-based screening."
Dr. Sklar urged that these problems be addressed now. "Scientists have an obligation to raise the issue and then the public has an obligation to set guidelines," he said.

Thatcher Deciphers Her Indelible Mark on Britain

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:

The Downing Street Years
 By Margaret Thatcher
 Illustrated. 914 pages. HarperCollins. $30.
During her 11 1/2 years as Britain's Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher collected a lot of encomiums and a lot of obloquy. George Bush hailed her as "the greengrocer's daughter who shaped a nation to her will," and others praised her as a successor to Churchill and the greatest peacetime Prime Minister since Gladstone. Piet Dankert, a former President of the European Parliament, called her "the witch in the European fairy tale: always clearly recognizable and always the person liable to turn everything upside down." To many members of Britain's liberal-left intelligentsia, she was simply "that woman," the avatar of all they detested about Britain in the 1980's; in the words of the writer and director Jonathan Miller, she was a despised symbol of "odious suburban gentility and sentimental, saccharine patriotism." 
 No doubt the ability of the Iron Lady to elicit highly polarized responses, combined with her own fabled outspokenness, contributed to the decision of HarperCollins to pay her a reported $5.4 million for "The Downing Street Years" and a future volume that is to chronicle her youth and rise to political power. The most striking thing about "The Downing Street Years," however, has nothing to do with its revelations (which aren't terribly earthshaking), or its settling of scores (which are predictable, and of marginal interest to most American readers). What is most striking about this book is that it's such a bore to read.
No one, pro or con Mrs. Thatcher, would question her impact on Britain. During her tenure as Prime Minister, she reversed years of Labor Party policies, effectively redrawing the nation's political and economic map. Under Thatcherism, entrepreneurship was encouraged, the power of labor unions was curtailed and a host of industries were privatized. Abroad, Mrs. Thatcher was acclaimed for helping to preside over the end of the cold war; at home, she won praise for helping to restore British self-esteem.
Throughout her residence at 10 Downing Street, Mrs. Thatcher radiated a domineering self-confidence, a seemingly unshakable faith in herself and her policies. Indeed, in this volume, she writes, referring to William Pitt the Elder, the first Earl of Chatham, who was Prime Minister from 1766 to 1768: "Chatham famously remarked, 'I know that I can save this country and that no one else can.' It would have been presumptuous of me to have compared myself to Chatham. But if I am honest, I must admit that my exhilaration came from a similar inner conviction."
During Mrs. Thatcher's tenure in office, this mind-set resulted in a dogged adherence to principles and policies, which in the case of the regressive and highly unpopular poll tax (or, as she calls it, "the community charge") and her reluctance to move toward European political and monetary union helped bring about her eventual downfall. In terms of her memoirs, this attitude of moral certainty results in a highly unreflective narrative, virtually devoid of retrospective analysis.
Mrs. Thatcher almost never apologizes or explains, or, for that matter, illuminates. Instead, she falls back on her habits as a scientist (before entering politics, she trained as a research chemist) and gives the reader a nonselective and minutely detailed account of what she said and did at dozens of meetings, summits and conferences. Certainly, this is an important part of the historical record, but for the lay reader, it can make for stultifying reading.
Individual sections of the book bear scintillating titles like "Finance and Farming" and "The 1980 Budget and the Medium Term Financial Strategy (M.T.F.S.)," and important political decisions are sandwiched between superfluous and numbing digressions: descriptions of weekends at Chequers, recitations of lending and exchange rates, itineraries of travel. To make matters worse, the book feels hastily assembled: Mrs. Thatcher even manages to repeatedly misspell the name of George Shultz (as in "the excellent new Secretary of State, George Schultz").
As for Mrs. Thatcher's prose, it tends to vacillate between the pallid and perfunctory ("Dubai is enchanting") and the bombastic or exhortatory. She characterizes the Falklands War as "an issue of dictatorship versus democracy" and later crows that "right had prevailed." The language of war is similarly invoked to describe dealings with strike leaders, political opponents and economic troubles. Elsewhere, debatable assertions are simply announced as self-evident truths. She writes, for example: "Sweep away some of the rhetoric, and with the exception of certain issues, like relations with South Africa, you will find that no country is as trusted in every continent as Britain."
In the course of "The Downing Street Years," Mrs. Thatcher reveals appreciably little about her private life, save that she and her husband, Denis, liked to indulge in late-night high-cholesterol snacks of cheese and eggs, and that she bought a lot of clothes from Aquascutum.
For the most part, her portraits of other people are predictable, too. She tells us that she liked Jimmy Carter, though "he had no large vision of America's future," that she regarded Ronald Reagan as "the American dream in action" and that she thought Mr. Bush turned his back "on the special position I had enjoyed in the Reagan Administration's counsels and confidence" as a way of distancing himself from his predecessor. Of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, she writes, "I spotted him because I was searching for someone like him."
For the record, Mrs. Thatcher expresses only mild condescension toward her successor, John Major: "He was relatively untested and his tendency to accept the conventional wisdom had given me pause for thought." Michael Heseltine, the former Defense Secretary who challenged her leadership of the Conservative Party, is knocked for his "giant ego": he "was not a team player and certainly not a team captain." And Geoffrey Howe, the former Foreign Secretary who contributed to her fall by giving a crucial speech in the House of Commons denouncing her policy on Europe, is roundly condemned for "this final act of bile and treachery."
Filled with passion and angry self-justification, Mrs. Thatcher's account of her last days in office is clearly the most dramatic, and oddly poignant, part of this book. To the end, she sticks by her controversial stands on European federalism and the poll tax, stands that helped to seal her fate.
Of the first, she reiterates her belief that "a federal Europe would be both unstable internally and an obstacle to harmonious arrangements, in trade, politics and defense." Of the second -- a tax on all resident adults, not just property owners -- she asserts, "Had I not been facing problems on other fronts -- above all, had the Cabinet and Party held their nerve -- I could have ridden through the difficulties." And, she adds, "given time, it would have been seen as one of the most far-reaching and beneficial reforms ever made in the working of local government."
In the end, such passages reflect both Mrs. Thatcher's overall attitude in office and the perspective of this fat and dreary book: as she puts it at one point, "I had set my course and stuck to it."

HEADLINE: Review/Theater: Any Given Day;
A Family Prequel By Frank D. Gilroy

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
The fact that Mother knows best in "Any Given Day," Frank D. Gilroy's bitterly nostalgic drama of family warfare, is by no means a source of comfort. Mother, who is played with monumental stoicism by the great Sada Thompson, knows everything, actually, since she is cursed with the power of clairvoyance. And judging by the pained, steely mask in which Ms. Thompson sets her face for much of her performance, her character has seen in her family's future, to borrow from a Gershwin song, "more clouds of gray than any Russian play could guarantee."
"Any Given Day," which is set in an oppressively formal, down-at-the-heels middle-class Bronx apartment in the early 1940's, most immediately evokes the corrosive family portraits that dominated American drama in the middle of this century. The play, at the Longacre Theater, also seems to be Mr. Gilroy's bid to write something like a Chekhovian tragicomedy of withering expectations. In it, he has created a host of regretful characters with puny hopes of escaping from a suffocating, ambition-thwarting domestic world. 
 Unfortunately, the playwright has stacked his dramatic deck so heavily, and burdened his script with so many lugubrious symbols, that one knows from the play's inception that his characters have less chance of escaping than the Prozorov sisters had of making it to Moscow. And though "Any Given Day" is as solidly constructed as the heavy, dark-wooded furniture of its set (evocatively designed by Marjorie Bradley Kellogg), it ultimately lacks any power to surprise. Again, if you're ever in doubt as to where things might be going, just take a look at Ms. Thompson's face.
The work is the latest play to appear under the aegis of the Broadway Alliance, a coalition devoted to bringing lower-cost theater to Broadway. Directed by Paul Benedict, it deals with the extended family of the Clearys, the three characters of "The Subject Was Roses," a partly autobiographical work by Mr. Gilroy that won the Pulitzer Prize in 1965. A spare, tightly built domestic drama about the frictions between a father, mother and son after the son has returned home from service in World War II, it was most notable for its poignant understatement and dramatic economy.
In "Any Given Day," which ends several years before "Roses" begins, Mr. Gilroy has expanded not only his cast but also his thematic ambitions and emotional scale. It is a companion piece that roots the crises of the earlier play in a dark, psychologically convoluted family matrix. The three Clearys reappear as members of a large, terminally unhappy clan, led by the unbending widowed matriarch, Mrs. Benti (Ms. Thompson).
The play begins with a sardonically festive dinner party at the apartment Mrs. Benti shares with her tubercular son, Eddie (Peter Frechette), and her mentally disabled, wheelchair-bound grandson, Willis (Justin Kirk). The dinner is the occasion for the announcement of the engagement of Willis's mother, Carmen (Andrea Marcovicci), to Gus Brower (Andrew Robinson), a self-made entrepreneur of clinical efficiency and blind optimism.
No one except Gus seems very excited by the prospective nuptials. Dr. Goldman (Stephen Pearlman), the family's physician and (inexplicably) their long-time admirer, describes Gus as the sort of man who will always deliver on his promises, but will never promise very much.
The reverse can be said of the Bentis themselves: Mrs. Benti was briefly married to a rich man before moving on to the ineffectual opera-loving gentleman who fathered her children; Carmen once had a career as a vaudeville and radio singer; John Cleary (Victor Slezak), the father from "Roses" -- who here, it turns out, is having an affair with Carmen, the sister of his wife, Nettie (Lisa Eichhorn) -- has the chance of a job in Brazil.
Alas, the factors that will always drag the Bentis down are given loud and ominous voice. There is not only Mrs. Benti's little habit of seeing dark prophecies in tea leaves. There is also Eddie's soul-wracking cough (shades of "Long Day's Journey Into Night"), and Willis's tendency to explode into inarticulate rants, which seem to give vent to the collective anguish that is never far from the surface.
When Willis struggles to a standing position and falls on his face, the metaphoric significance is unmistakable. And when the clan gathers around the piano to sing "Dreamland," the irony rumbles like thunder.
Mr. Gilroy, who retains his fine ear for barbed domestic dialogue, is best in the early group scenes, when forced family jollity shades into potentially explosive prickliness. And there are a few moments that, with their melancholy resonances of the ambivalence common to all family relationships, have inescapable emotional pull. (Incidentally, two of them, including one in which a son dances with his mother in a flash of fleeting joy, directly recall events in "Roses.")
These are overwhelmed, however, by the play's series of melodramatic revelations (one involves a botched abortion and a mysterious stranger from the past) and some brazen confessional speeches. Ms. Marcovicci gets the most labored of them, in which Carmen, describing her time in vaudeville, announces bitterly, "For the first and only time in my life, I was free."
The cast here is potentially very strong, but few of its members are shown to their best advantage. Ms. Marcovicci and Ms. Eichhorn, both appealing performers, are trapped in a Good Sister-Bad Sister dichotomy that seems to inhibit nuance. Mr. Pearlman and Mr. Robinson exist principally as obtuse foils. Mr. Slezak is fine as the bristly, defensive son-in-law. And Mr. Frechette emanates a luminous, humor-edged ruefulness that breathes spontaneous life into some otherwise creaky scenes.
It is, of course, a treat to have Ms. Thompson back on a New York stage. With minimal changes of expression, she can switch on the transfixing, weighty sense of presence the part demands. But in the role of a maternal Cassandra, she seems to spend much of the play in a trance. One looks forward to seeing her fully awake on Broadway again.

DEAR Diary:
The setting was a restaurant in Manhattan. Cast of characters: a star-struck friend and I. Topic of conversation: plays and performers.
I: Did I tell you I had dinner with Kim Hunter and her husband the other night?
She, with deep sigh: Wasn't she wonderful as Blanche in "Streetcar"?

"Oh, no, sir, that isn't writing," the young woman told him. "It's just a design."
Mr. Holland countered that the pattern was unmistakably that form of writing used millenniums ago by Babylonian and related cultures. He added that a translation ought to be available to purchasers of the ring. After all, he argued, very few people would be able to read the ancient language and understand the inscription on their purchase.
"O.K., so it is a form of writing," the clerk replied cheerily. "But you can buy it without concern about what it says since the odds are that you will never meet anyone able to read it anyway. No one will dislike what the inscription says."
At last glance, the ring remained unsold. Mr. Holland's curiosity is still unsatisfied.

Dear Diary:
I was asked did I know anyone who plays the accordion. The question was posed by a friend who was giving a shower for a mutual friend. The shower theme was to be Italian, because the couple were planning to honeymoon in Italy. At first I said no, but then I remembered hearing someone playing the accordion outside my window in the morning, so I said I would investigate.
One evening that week I heard a guitar player in my backyard and decided to yell out from my second-floor window to inquire, "Hello, Mr. Guitar Player, hello?"
"Yes," came the answer. "What's up?"
"Are you the person who also plays the accordion, because I have a job for you."
"No, I'm not but could you use a guitar player?"
"No, but do you know anyone who does play the accordion?"
"No, I don't."
Third voice shouting from the back yard: "Hello? I'm the accordion player. Take my number and give me a call."
Went to phone. Dialed. Male voice: "Accordion player unlimited."
Footnote: He played very well at the shower. My friends were really impressed by my backyard resource.
I am now contemplating a career change to musicians' agent. The guitar player is still unemployed but hopeful. PAMELA BLACK

HEADLINE: The Pacific Summit

 BODY:
O.K., APEC still isn't a household word. But by inviting a dozen national leaders to meet with him informally outside Seattle this weekend, President Clinton has usefully focused American attention on the previously obscure Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Despite its new visibility, the forum remains fragile and sketchily defined. The APEC region, however, with half the world's production and almost 40 percent of its trade, is now essential to America's international economic vitality. 
 Trans-Pacific commerce already far exceeds U.S. trade with Europe or Latin America. Asia's prominence is sure to increase, since it is the only region now experiencing vibrant growth. Yet before the Clinton Administration, Asia was not a top Washington priority. Many ordinary citizens see Asia's economic advances as threatening, not appreciating the opportunities they also present.
The Seattle sessions begin today as foreign and economic ministers from the 15 member nations discuss liberalizing trade and investment. On the weekend Mr. Clinton and the 10 or 11 leaders who accepted his invitation (Malaysia declined and New Zealand is in post-election deadlock) will discuss future directions for APEC and other issues.
The leadership conference flows from Mr. Clinton's idea of a "Pacific Community," one of the Administration's more promising foreign policy initiatives to date. The President rightly sees expanded U.S. links with booming Asia as a way to recharge the domestic economy. It hopes that APEC can contribute to more balanced relationships by lowering trade barriers and facilitating the U.S. investment that developing Asia says it wants.
That's about as far as most members are prepared to go now. But a report prepared by a group of "eminent persons" from the member countries suggests a more ambitious agenda: energetic lobbying for a global trade agreement and steps toward building an Asia Pacific Economic Community, including coordination of monetary and fiscal policies and regular leaders' sessions.
The Seattle meetings will also consider membership applications from Mexico, Papua New Guinea and Chile. The first two are expected to get in. Chile is qualified, geographically and economically, but some Asian members fear that its admission could give the organization too American a tilt.
APEC enthusiasts like the United States, Australia and Singapore need to be attentive to the hesitations of other members if the organization, which operates by consensus, is to survive. But they also need to keep pressing, patiently, for a broader and more ambitious agenda. Otherwise APEC's survival will scarcely matter.

HEADLINE: Mr. Clinton's Promising Speech

 BODY:
Their citizens pinned down by gunfire in the streets, their coffers emptied by the burden of caring for the poor, their schools ineffectual or on the verge of collapse -- America's cities are crying out for an urban policy from Washington.
Presidents Reagan and Bush responded to that cry with racial code words and scorn, often demonizing cities for political gain. But in his speech last weekend in Memphis, Bill Clinton confronted urban issues in a way that inspired people instead of dividing them. Mr. Clinton's speech offers hope that Washington may yet turn its attention to the cities, America's most pressing domestic problem. 
 Mr. Clinton spoke at the Temple Church of God in Christ in Memphis, from the pulpit where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last sermon. The President spoke in chilling detail about the violence and the drug trade that ravages the cities. Of the young who are so afraid of random killing that they plan their own funerals, he said, "I think, finally, we may be ready to do something about it."
Mr. Clinton was refreshingly candid when he spoke about breakdown of families and the rise of illegitimacy and abandonment by fathers. In previous times, the topic had mainly been used as a way of bludgeoning the poor and dividing Americans along ideological lines. But in Memphis the President explained to the nation that morality and personal responsibility are intimately connected with the surroundings in which people live. "I do not believe we can repair the basic fabric of society until people who are willing to work have work," Mr. Clinton said. "Work organizes life."
"We cannot, I submit to you, repair the American community and restore the American family," he said, "until we provide the structure, the values, the discipline and the reward that work gives."
The President owes much to William Julius Wilson, The University of Chicago sociologist whose pioneering work, "The Truly Disadvantaged," showed how the departure of inner-city industry greatly accelerated the unraveling of the urban African-American family. Mr. Wilson offers solutions as well, none of them cheap.
As inspiring as it was, Mr. Clinton's sermon was only a prologue to an urban policy. Big-city mayors will surely want to hear more of how he intends to stimulate investment in cities. Enterprise zones won't do it. What will?
And what of gun control? The Brady bill, with its five-day waiting period, is a welcome advance over guns on demand. But a plan for demilitarizing the streets is still sorely needed.
And what of welfare reform? Housing and feeding America's poor is bankrupting the cities and states.
Memphis was the prologue; now we await the program.

HEADLINE: Nafta and the National Interest

 BODY:
He started slowly. But over the past two months, President Clinton has pushed fellow Democrats to embrace the North American Free Trade Agreement. He's bucked organized labor and rejected the advice of some of his closest advisers -- who cautioned that the price of victory would be too steep. Staking his reputation on the outcome of tonight's vote in the House, he's done what a President is supposed to do when issues are tough and the public is evenly divided: Lead.
The question now is whether a Democratic Congress will vote its conscience or its fears. A no vote wouldn't bury the Clinton Presidency. But it would cast doubt on his and his party's ability to govern. It would also undermine Mr. Clinton's credibility abroad, just as the all-important Uruguay Round of international trade talks is drawing to a close. Beyond that, it could send a devastating signal about America's appetite for global leadership after the cold war. That is what the Nafta vote is ultimately about: whether the country is willing to move forward or retreat into economic isolation. 
 As a trade pact, Nafta helps the economy modestly. It would promote exports of manufactured goods like automobiles and services like insurance. In exchange, it would lower already low U.S. tariffs on Mexican vegetables, garments and other consumer goods. Job gains will roughly offset job losses -- and consumer prices will fall.
But Nafta's most important job is buttressing the historic U.S. role in promoting freer trade, a policy that has done more to nurture worldwide growth since World War II than any other.
To avoid a major rift within his party, Mr. Clinton flirted with letting Congress do with Nafta as it pleased. Ultimately, however, he decided that as a matter of politics Nafta was too important to let die. So he steadily raised the ante for his fellow Democrats -- even promising to defend Republican candidates next year against challengers who criticized pro-Nafta votes. Tonight will tell whether Mr. Clinton started too late, too slowly.
Privately, several Democrats who declared themselves against Nafta admit that the agreement would probably help the country, if not their constituents. But boisterous opposition -- sometimes based on misguided fears -- has made it difficult for many Democrats to vote their consciences. And several Republicans, some lifelong free-traders, are flirting with voting no just to rob Mr. Clinton of an important victory.
But this is a vote that challenges each member of Congress to set aside parochialism and vote for the higher national interest.

HEADLINE: In America;
Pretty Words on Nafta

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Back in October 1992, when the campaign was going great and the promises flowed as easily as water from a tap, Bill Clinton indicated that he had understood.
In a speech at North Carolina State University in support of the North American Free Trade agreement, Mr. Clinton said: 
 "For a high-wage country like ours, the blessings of more trade can be offset, at least in part, by the loss of income and jobs as more and more multinational corporations take advantage of their ability to move money, management and production away from a high-wage country to a low-wage country.
"We can also lose incomes because those companies who stay at home can use the threat of moving to depress wages, as many do today."
Those remarks were -- and remain -- especially meaningful against the backdrop of a United States economy that is hemorrhaging good jobs and creating poor ones. The Wall Street Journal told of a man in rural Vermont who is working full time, but after the rent and other expenses are paid, does not always have money left over for food. At times he has to hunt so his family can eat.
There are millions of Americans who can no longer take eating for granted. I spent some time with a family in Vermont that had worked out strategies for eating. The parents ate less so there would be more food for their 6-year-old son. At times it was necessary to ship the boy to his grandmother's house to be sure that he got a decent meal.
This is not Depression-era America we're talking about. This is America on the verge of the 21st century.
Mr. Clinton, aware of the nation's crisis in jobs, did not suggest in his North Carolina speech that Nafta was a "no-brainer."
He said: "Too many Republicans would say that free trade today always equals economic growth. Well, it can, but only if we have a comprehensive national strategy to promote that kind of growth.
"Some Democrats would say that free trade today always equals exporting jobs and lowering wages. Well, it sure can if you don't have a comprehensive economic strategy to maintain a high-wage, high-growth economy."
A comprehensive strategy to maintain a high-wage, high-growth economy. It made sense. It sounded good. Where is it?
Some proponents of Nafta have taken a contemptuous view of the other side, dismissing the opposition as know-nothing isolationists and protectionists. That is unfair. Concern for American and Mexican workers who are being ruthlessly exploited by rapacious corporations is not a form of neo-isolationism.
If anything, much of the support for Nafta has been of the knee-jerk kind. In September 300 economists sent a petition supporting Nafta to Mr. Clinton. The cover letter began, "Dear Mr. President: As economists we feel it is necessary to set the record straight on the costs and benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement."
The White House made a big deal out of the letter. But when the People's Radio Network, a nonprofit group of 230 stations, began contacting the economists, it turned out that very few had bothered to read the massive agreement. PRN reached 150 of the 300 economists. Only 19 said they had read the agreement, and 8 did not even remember signing the petition.
Nevertheless they were setting the record straight.
Meanwhile, the wholesale loss of good American jobs continues. The monthly Challenger Employment Report, compiled by the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said that companies announced 66,801 layoffs in October, up from 48,786 in September.
James Challenger, president of the firm, said, "Workers at all levels, especially recent victims of mass layoffs, must be terribly confused by all the talk from economists about a growing economy while at the same time reading an increased number of layoff announcements."
President Clinton had it right in his campaign speech. "We need not only to reduce trade barriers, but to prepare our entire work force not only to compete in the global economy but to live with the changes in it and make sure nobody gets left behind."
Pretty words. That's what you get in campaigns.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Thumbs Nose at Displaced Workers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Labor leaders are fighting the North American Free Trade Agreement because of the lack of adequate protections for workers who will be hurt by a common market. In the 1980's I conducted a study of Federal job training programs in the Chicago area as the region struggled to recover from massive loss of industry. 
 It was apparent then that the programs were inadequate. The training was too superficial and too short, and good new jobs were not being created in the older areas for older workers without higher education. Many workers, families and communities were devastated and still have not recovered. When new growth did come, it came in other communities, occupied by higher income families with more education.
The record of the last generation and the recent report of the Labor Department's inspector general on the trade adjustment assistance program show that we have no programs likely to restore the losses of the affected families or communities.
This leads me to believe that President Clinton is making a serious mistake in attacking the labor movement for criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Labor leaders, who have been living through massive dismantling of much of the older industrial base in the United States for a generation, are trying to represent the interests of their members. Since these workers are a vital part of the Democratic coalition, it would be much better to acknowledge the legitimacy of some of their concerns and propose realistic solutions.
The basic problem is that there are going to be lots of victims of the economic changes that will come with the trade agreement, no matter how much overall good it may bring. Victims are going to be concentrated among reasonably well-paid industrial workers and their communities. United States gainers are going to be concentrated among people with more education. The kind of retraining available is not adequate to prevent most of these workers from experiencing a devastating loss of income, status, family and community prospects. The gains will go elsewhere. Often the losses will be among working-class Democrats, the gains among middle-class Republicans.
If the President and Congress believe that the North American Free Trade Agreement is the right move for the country (and I think that it probably is), they should work out a serious retraining program with sufficient education and living stipends to give the displaced workers a reasonable chance at a job earning as much as the one they are being asked to give up for the greater good of the country. This would normally require post-high school education.
Alternatively, these workers should be offered wage supplements for a reasonable number of years. The President should recognize that the workers who are threatened draw no comfort from economic charts that suggest that others will do better while their chances for the American dream wither.
The House of Representatives is designed to reflect powerfully the needs of individual regions and to bring those local concerns into the shaping of policy that the entire country can live with. Many members of the House, particularly urban Democrats, know exactly what it is like to lose major employers in regions where no major new plants have been built in generations. It would be appropriate for those members to vote to delay the trade agreement until their constituents get a better deal.
We are proposing as a nation to flood the institutions from which many workers and their families draw their sustenance. It isn't an accident or an act of nature, like the Mississippi flood -- it is a policy.
Congress should insist that those of us likely to gain from this policy offer fair recompense to those who are sacrificed. The Administration should recognize the labor movement as an essential party in working out better answers.

HEADLINE: Poles Can't Afford Baby Food in Jars

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"In Poland, Gerber Learns Lessons of Tradition" (front page, Nov. 8) implies that Gerber's main obstacle to marketing baby food in Poland is tradition. 
 Because of the Polish economic situation, processed baby food is a luxury for young Polish mothers. Most employees, from university professors to factory workers, take home $100 to $200 a month. Rent and transportation are expensive, leaving little disposable income for the average young family.
Fortunately, during the socialist period, agriculture was not collectivized, so Poland has been able to feed itself. Nonprocessed food is cheap and plentiful. Hunger is almost unknown to Poles outside of Warsaw.
As more companies invest in Poland, incomes will rise, and more young parents will be able to afford commercial baby food. Gerber would do better now to establish name recognition, reputation and a distribution network by selling nonluxury items like baby bottles, nipples and pacifiers.

HEADLINE: Europe's Bad Example

 BODY:
To the Editor:
William Proxmire believes (letter, Nov. 5) that in coming years, "as unemployment zooms," the United States should follow Europe's lead and shorten the workweek.
Yet, from the four European countries the former Senator holds as a model -- Germany, Norway, France and Denmark -- it's clear that a shorter workweek is no solution to unemployment. He reports the average workweek in these four countries is 30 hours, compared with 37 hours in the United States. But the unemployment rates in these countries are 8.3, 7, 11.7 and 11 percent, respectively, compared with 6.8 percent for the United States!
Let's not copy Europe's bad economic policies. We don't want to import their lower wages and arthritic labor markets.

HEADLINE: Personal Health

BYLINE: By Jane E. Brody

 BODY:
AFTER nearly a decade of controversy-ridden research and deliberation, the Food and Drug Administration this month approved for commercial use the first agricultural product produced through genetic engineering. It is a hormone called bovine somatotropin, or BST, which when injected into dairy cows can increase their milk production by 10 to 20 percent or more. The use of BST would enable farmers to get more milk from fewer cows using less feed and producing less waste.
On the face of it, BST and its as yet unapproved counterpart, porcine somatotropin (PST), which when injected into pigs reduces the amount of fat in their meat, sound like biotechnological miracles that would give consumers more for their money at less cost to the environment. 
 Yet these and other long-tested products developed by using living organisms as gene factories are likely to be mired in continuing controversies instigated more by ignorance, nostalgia and a Luddite view of technology than by understanding and actual facts.
The leading critic of biotechnology, Jeremy Rifkin, who heads the Foundation on Economic Trends in Washington, has threatened demonstrations, boycotts and campaigns to press for legislated bans on milk produced by BST-treated cows.
Already more than a dozen large dairies and supermarket chains have announced their refusal to use milk from BST-treated cows. In many cases, opposition has been touched off by wildly misleading claims about the risks of BST to consumers, cows and farmers. It is reminiscent of the fierce opposition to pasteurization of milk a century ago. According to various surveys, 20 to 50 percent of consumers have reservations about using milk from BST-treated cows, with those who know the least about it expressing the greatest concern.
Bovine somatotropin is a growth hormone naturally produced by cows. When a dairy cow is given extra doses of it, her feed is more efficiently converted into milk and her milk yield rises. Thus, dairy farmers can produce more milk at less expense, providing a greater profit margin and, possibly, lower consumer prices. The cows, in turn, produce less waste, contributing to environmental quality. Over all, according to Dr. Dale E. Bauman, the Cornell University animal scientist who pioneered somatotropin technology, BST could result in an unprecedented increase in the efficiency of dairy production.
The potential of BST had been known for decades, but not until the application of genetic engineering in the 1970's was it possible to obtain enough inexpensive BST to use in research and, potentially, on commercial dairy farms. Now huge amounts of the hormone can be harvested from bacteria that have been genetically induced to produce it. At least four manufacturers expect to market the synthetically produced hormone.
 
Health Issues
 The composition, flavor and almost every other characteristic of milk from BST-treated cows have been very extensively studied. Use of the hormone does not change the nutrients in milk or how it tastes. Nor is there necessarily any increase in the amount of BST present in milk. Even when there is, the bovine hormone is inactive in people (it works only in cows); it is destroyed by pasteurization, and it has no effect if administered orally because it is a protein that is broken down in the digestive tract.
But there is an increase in another substance, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), in the milk of cows treated with BST, with IGF-I levels rising to those found in human breast milk. While IGF-I is not destroyed by pasteurization, it too would be dismantled by digestive enzymes. It has no effect when given orally to rats and it is inactivated by the processing used to produce infant formula. The American Academy of Pediatrics has declared milk from BST-treated cows to be safe for infants as well as adults.
Some opponents believe that BST treatment can harm cows by putting more stress on them and weakening their immune systems, leading to udder infections. And indeed in a number of studies, but not all, there has been a small increase in cases of mastitis, an infection of the mammary glands, in cows treated with BST. The hormone itself is not the cause; rather, mastitis is more common in cows that are high milk producers, and the frequency of this infection in BST-treated cows is about the same as in naturally high producers.
The problem, however, is not the infection itself but the antibiotics that are used to treat it, which could result in a slight increase in antibiotic residues in milk. The Food and Drug Administration limits allowable drug residues to minute quantities, and monitoring by the agency has recently been shored up to assure compliance with the regulations.
 
Future Promise
 The safety and desirability of BST have been endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health (which held a two-day meeting of experts to assess BST's effects), the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Dietetic Association. It is highly unlikely that all these overseers and advocates for a healthy America could have been hoodwinked into approving an undesirable treatment.
Still, if this first instance of biotechnology in agriculture should end up a financial disaster for the companies (primarily Monsanto) that have invested millions of dollars in developing and testing it, the willingness of manufacturers to try to market other notable achievements of biotechnology will be seriously threatened. For example, porcine somatotropin, which is waiting in the wings, could reduce the fat content of pork by more than half. Another feat of genetic engineering would increase the shelf life and the flavor of tomatoes.
The potential of genetic engineering for improving agricultural products by increasing yields and enhancing nutritional value is almost limitless.
Possibilities include increasing the protein value of corn and grains, inducing tolerance to frost and drought, building in resistance to pests, speeding maturation of plants and animals, introducing cancer-blocking agents, reducing the need for fertilizer, increasing vitamin and mineral content and modifying the amount and types of fats in foods. But whether such improvements will ever reach the marketplace will depend largely on how well consumers accept BST.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 24, 1993, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
The Personal Health column last Wednesday about a genetically engineered hormone, bovine somatotropin, or BST, that increases milk production in cows misstated the view of the American Academy of Pediatrics on its safety and desirability. An editorial in Pediatrics, the organization's journal, endorsed the use of the hormone, but the academy has not taken a position.

HEADLINE: Cold War Over, Foreign Affairs Schools Refocus

BYLINE: By KEN BROWN

 BODY:
With the end of the cold war eliminating the superpower tensions that guided two generations of diplomats, graduate schools of foreign affairs are shifting their focus to the complexities of world trade, new technologies and the environment.
"The foreign policy after the cold war is going to be more concerned with economics and technology, and it's going to be more driven by the private sector than Government," said Stephen F. Szabo, associate dean for academic affairs at Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. 
 "There is a sense that security and traditional concerns that were associated with the cold war have diminished in importance," said Professor Szabo, who led a curriculum review that included the creation of a program in energy, environmental science and technology.
The changes have been felt most deeply in courses on international security and on the former Soviet Union, which had been mainstays of curriculums at the major universities around the country that offer two-year master's degrees in international affairs.
But as such programs rush to meet the needs of a new generation of foreign affairs specialists, they are also struggling to preserve a focus that distinguishes them from business and other schools that are paying more attention to international issues, once the province of foreign affairs programs.
 
Tossing Old Lecture Notes
 At the same time, the push for new curriculums is offering international affairs schools an opportunity to breath new life into old courses.
Jeswald W. Salacuse, dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said: "We're looking at new issues. We're looking at old issues in new ways. And so I don't think anybody is teaching his or her material in exactly the same way it was taught before."
Among the examples of new directions cited by Dean Salacuse are courses on conflict resolution and peacekeeping. The school is also bringing in anthropologists to teach a course on the cultural and ethnic roots of conflict.
At Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, Philip D. Zelikow, an assistant professor of public policy, has shifted the main international relations course from a bipolar view of world relations to an emphasis on combining economics and political science to develop policy choices.
"For Americans during the cold war, some of the dominant interests were already mapped out, and people defined their positions by reference to that map, even if they didn't agree with it," Professor Zelikow said. "Now people are having to chart new intellectual maps of how they perceive the world. It's a harder challenge, both intellectually and politically, as President Clinton has discovered."
 
Demand for Programs Grows
 Professors are now dwelling more on power relations that lie outside the classical east-west military balance that defined cold war diplomacy. Today's security programs focus on small regional and ethnic conflicts and peacekeeping, while programs on Soviet studies concentrate on the building of democracy and free markets in the former republics and the new nations being carved from the old empire.
"There was wide recognition that old courses had fallen into this pattern of political and military on one side and economics on the other side," said Professor Zelikow, who was a foreign service officer and served in the Bush White House before going to Harvard in 1991.
Despite the rapidly changing international scene, or perhaps because of it, interest in foreign affairs programs has continued to grow. According to a study by 12 of the 15 members of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs, applications rose 63 percent between 1988 and 1992. Of the 12,000 students who applied to the two-year master's degree programs at the top 15 schools in 1992, about 39 percent were admitted, the group said.
The schools, which charge $7,500 to more than $19,000 a year in tuition and fees, are all trying to remain competitive by responding to student demands.
 
Working to Stay Competitive

For example, the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia has attracted students by offering media courses in conjunction with the university's Graduate School of Journalism. But when in-coming students in the fall of 1990 found they were being shut out of media courses, including the broadcasting class, they organized and protested, demanding more classes, better access to the journalism school and fewer guest professors.
"People felt that the program was oversold," said Claudia Kalb, who as a graduate student in international affairs helped organize the protest. "It was advertised as a journalism program, and it really wasn't.
The school responded by adding classes and paying the journalism school to admit international affairs students to its broadcasting course.
Nowhere is the blurring of the schools' purpose more evident than in the international business programs that many of them now offer. Students are keenly aware that they are entering a tough job market in which they will be competing with M.B.A. graduates who are getting more international training than ever before.
 
Confusion in Job Market
 Professor Szabo of Johns Hopkins, said: "The business schools already are beginning to come in the direction of international relations training because they understand their students are going to be working in a global economy. We have to move, to some degree, toward the M.B.A. program and provide some of the more technical skills to help them at the entry level."
Johns Hopkins, for example, has added an accounting course to its international relations program, he said.
Several school officials say that their students now have all the skills of someone with an M.B.A., plus knowledge of politics, economic development and languages, but that recruiters reflexively hire business school graduates.
"It is clear with the internationalization of business schools the marketplace has become confused over how we are different," said John G. Ruggie, the Dean of Columbia's international affairs program.
Aggravating the problem is the fact that the top 15 schools offer an alphabet soup of 22 degrees with different names and derived from different curriculums, said Allan E. Goodman, associate dean of the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.
"There is tremendous confusion in the marketplace about what we do," he said, "and it's going to take a while for people to realize these degrees are roughly the same and they prepare people for public and private service."
Such confusion in the job market has also engendered some resentment among unemployed and deeply indebted graduates. Several said they regretted not having chosen business school instead of international affairs, where, in the words of Kaushik Shridharani, an unemployed graduate of Columbia's program, "the degree becomes so diluted" as to be almost useless.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: The Overview;
HOUSE BACKS FREE TRADE PACT IN MAJOR VICTORY FOR CLINTON AFTER A LONG HUNT FOR VOTES

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
President Clinton scored one of the biggest triumphs of his Presidency tonight when the House of Representatives voted to expand trade with Mexico and turn North America into the world's largest free trade zone.
Legislation to put the North American Free Trade Agreement into effect starting Jan. 1 and to gradually abolish nearly all trade barriers between the United States, Mexico and Canada was adopted by a vote of 234 to 200, with three-fifths of the Democrats voting against the President and most Republicans supporting him. 
 The surprisingly large margin of victory, 16 votes more than needed to approve the legislation, could not have been imagined as recently as last weekend. As late as this afternoon, the Administration's head-counters, while expressing confidence, said victory was not a certainty.
 
'We Chose to Compete'
 Senate approval in the next week is certain, leaders of both parties said.
In the tally tonight, 102 of the 258 Democrats voted for the measure and to support their President. They were joined by 132 Republicans. On the other side, 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans and one independent voted against the bill. [Roll-call, page A20.]
Other than the budget votes in August, when Mr. Clinton prevailed by two votes in the House and one vote in the Senate, tonight's vote was the most important politically for the President and for Congress.
At the White House tonight, Mr. Clinton proclaimed the victory "a defining moment for our nation."
"At a time when many of our people are hurting from the strains of this tough global economy," he said, "we chose to compete, not retreat. Tonight I am proud to say, we have not flinched."
In an odd reversal, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, gave a spirited defense of the President and the trade agreement in the final moments of the daylong debate. And Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the Democratic whip and usually a Clinton loyalist, gave an emotional closing speech against the measure.
With almost every representative on the floor and every seat in the visitors' gallery filled as the vote neared, Mr. Michel declared that the opponents of expanded trade with Mexico wanted "to define our time as the age of anxiety, in which our only response to the challenges of global competition is to retreat, whine and whimper."
He implored his colleagues, "Do not sacrifice the jobs of tomorrow to the fears of today."
 
A Standing Ovation
 Mr. Bonior brought the Democratic side of the chamber to its feet with a standing ovation, and some legislators appeared to be in tears.
"The working people who stand against this treaty don't have degrees from Harvard," he declared. "They don't study economic models. And most of them have never heard of Adam Smith. But they know when the deck is stacked against them. They know it's not fair to ask American workers to compete gainst Mexican workers who earn $1 an hour.
"The work of America is still done by people who pack a lunch, punch a clock and pour their heart and soul into every paycheck. And we can't afford to leave them behind."
In the debate, Republicans made a point of the fact that they were supporting Mr. Clinton as he prepares to go to Seattle for a meeting with leaders from Asian countries. Democrats did not appeal for loyalty to their party's President, a recognition that the heart of the party lay elsewhere.
 
Thank You to Republicans
 Appearing before television cameras in the Grand Foyer of the White House, just after 11 P.M., Mr. Clinton reached out to the fellow Democrats and labor leaders with whom he had fiercely battled. He portrayed them as "passionate defenders of the working people."
But even before his public remarks, Mr. Clinton telephoned Mr. Michel and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, to thank them for the Republican assistance that proved decisive in winning passage of the trade accord.
Vice President Al Gore is likely to travel to Mexico next week to discuss implementation of the accord with President Carlos Salinas Gortari, White House officials said tonight.
Mr. Clinton depicted the vote as a decisive moment in his Presidency, and spent the bulk of the last several weeks rounding up support. In Congress, some members saw the occasion as a rare vote on which their political futures could hang.
 
Symbol of Change
 The agreement, negotiated by the Bush Administration, creates a free trade zone from the Yukon to Yucatan. Since the United States and Canada are already bound by a free trade agreement, and since commerce between Canada and Mexico is relatively meager, the main question involved trade expansion between the United States and Mexico, its third-largest trading partner.
The substantive arguments seemed almost mundane, not worthy of the high political stakes riding on the outcome. Proponents said the agreement would generate a few hundred thousand additional jobs in the United States; opponents said it would cost a few hundred thousand. In an economy where about 120 million people go to work every day, the difference is no more than a statistical asterisk.
But the accord had become a symbol of the economic changes in the United States, of the promise for those who stand to benefit from an economy dominated by high technology and an educated work force, and of the anxiety for those who see a future in which there are ever-fewer high-paying assembly-line jobs for Americans without a college education or a skilled craft.
Labor unions ferociously opposed the agreement. Businesses generally supported it. Economists and foreign policy experts were almost unanimously in favor of it. So was every living past President, from Richard M. Nixon through George Bush.
Many political strategists advised their clients to vote against the agreement. In part, the reason was that opponents seemed to feel so much more strongly about the accord than those who favored it. In part, it was that legislators who voted for the agreement could expect to be blamed for every factory that closes in their districts, regardless of the real reason for the shutdown.
 
Equally Divided Time
 Partisan loyalties went by the boards, in striking contrast to the budget battle, which was decided on party-line votes. Within the Democratic and Republican parties, the divisions on trade were sharper than they had been over any other issue since the Vietnam War. Representatives mostly voted on the basis of what they saw as the interest of their own districts.
Usually, the debate time in the House is divided equally between proponents of an issue and opponents. This time, the eight hours of debate were allotted in fourths. Democratic supporters and opponents and Republican supporters and opponents each got two hours. No amendments were allowed.
The opposition outside the Capitol had strange bedfellows: Ross Perot and Ralph Nader, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Patrick J. Buchanan.
Both sides presented the vote as one on which America's future was in the balance.
Representative Dan Rostenkowski, a Chicago Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee and backed the agreement, put the matter this way:
"Our vote today will help determine what kind of American economy our children will inherit. We are debating whether America is a confident country, eager to face the future, ready to take on all competitors, or a nation in decline clinging to memories of our past.
"In this debate, we are telling the world how we view ourselves, whether we welcome change and challenge or whether we fear it."
But the agreement's opponents were equally passionate.
"This agreement before us is deficient and flawed," declared Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader.
Mr. Gephardt complained that the accord did too little to raise wages in Mexico to a point where American companies would not be induced to close their plants here and move south of the border.
"This country's greatness," he shouted, "was not built on cheap labor."
 
A Novel Experience
 Occasionally during the Reagan and Bush years, when Democrats controlled the House, as they have since the early 1950's, significant tax and budget measures strongly supported by the White House were approved with Democratic support over the opposition of a majority of House Republicans. That was the case in 1985 on legislation overhauling the income tax system and in 1990 on a deficit-reduction package.
But students of Congress said they could not recall an occasion when the White House and the House of Representatives were controlled by the same party and major legislation was approved with the majority party in the House voting against it.
The House was not literally voting on the trade agreement itself tonight. Rather, it was considering legislation that would make the necessary changes in American law so the agreement could go into effect.
As recently as last weekend, Mr. Bonior and others on his side said they had the votes locked up to defeat the pact. But that underestimated the hole cards in the White House's hand.
Alone and in groups, representatives were called to the White House to be worked over by the President. Those on the fence received 10, 20, 30 calls a day from Cabinet members and influential constituents rounded up by proponents of the accord. Mr. Clinton himself was still on the phone most of today.
To win support from particular lawmakers, deals were struck to restrain imports of orange juice, winter vegetables, sugar, peanut butter and wheat. A development bank was promised, to provide seed money for environmental development projects in the United States and Mexico.
As far as could be learned, all the deals involved trade and border projects. If bridges, judgeships or other more tangible prizes were offered in return for votes, the arrangements remained secret.
Opponents of the accord complained that votes were being bought and sold. But Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said today that the late arrangements represented "a strengthening of the agreement" and were "very important from the American point of view."

HEADLINE: U.S. Bishops Urge Men to Share in Work at Home

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The nation's Roman Catholic bishops today unanimously voted to urge husbands and wives to treat one another as equals and men to share fully in child rearing and household duties.
The bishops also voted to ask the Vatican to make it easier to dismiss priests who sexually molest minors and passed a lengthy document on the moral responsibilities of the United States in the post-cold-war world. 
 The bishops said they sympathized with families in their struggles to cope with economic pressures and the unforeseen traumas of divorce, illness, alcoholism, neighborhood violence and AIDS, as well as the daily frictions of "different temperaments and opposing points of views."
The letter to families, titled "Follow the Way of Love," was approved by a unanimous vote. Its wording is practical and direct, avoiding the often difficult style of church documents that address questions of doctrine.
Aware of their status as celibate clergy, the bishops said that, nonetheless, "We have known the commitment and sacrifices of a mother and father, the warmth of a family's care, the happiness and pain that are part of loving." And they noted that they, too, "are sons and brothers and uncles."
Addressing their words primarily to Catholic families but adding that they might be useful to others, the bishops said, "The story of family life is a story about love -- shared, nurtured, and sometimes rejected or lost."
The bishops asked men and women to look beyond the familiar sexual roles. For many men, they said, "sharing feelings and a willingness to be vulnerable can be difficult, especially for those of us raised in the 'strong and silent' tradition."
The bishops urged men to view "their traditional role as 'provider' for a family in more than an economic sense. "Physical care of children, discipline, training in religious values and practices, helping with school work and other activities, all these and more can be provided by fathers as well as mothers," they said.
The message recognized that rapid social change and the hectic pace of American life were taking a toll on families.
"We urge you to take time to be together: making shared meals a priority (even if you gather at a fast-food restaurant), praying and worshiping together, especially at the Sunday Eucharist," the bishops said, and "building family traditions and rituals."
The message also develops the concept of the family as a "domestic church" that carries out a religious mission through spouses' love for each other and the care and teaching provided children.
The message will be widely distributed in the church.
 
Some Criticism of Text
 Some conservative Catholics criticized the message, which was written as the bishops' contribution to the "International Year of the Family" announced by the United Nations for 1994. In the newsletter of Women for Faith and Family, Helen Hull Hitchcock, the group's executive director, called the message "a retrogressive rehash of the secular sociological nostrums of the recent past -- with a heavy layer of multiculturalism and a thin Catholic glaze."
But none of that sentiment was expressed at the bishops' meeting. Four of the nation's active cardinals praised the document. Roger Cardinal Mahony of Los Angeles called it "so readable that it is hardly believable it is one of our documents."
Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua of Philadelphia expressed gratitude for the message's reference to the fact that bishops, too, are members of families and experience the joys and tragedies of family life. "Sometimes people think we are products of spontaneous generation," he said.
The document on the United States and international affairs said the bishops recognized that the collapse of Communism had revealed the "new importance" of nonviolence. But the bishops turned down the pleas of Detroit's Auxiliary Bishop, Thomas J. Gumbleton, a representative of the pacifist wing of the American bishops, to condemn all warfare as immoral and to demand the immediate abandonment of the nation's remaining nuclear weapons.
 
On Sex-Abuse Cases
 Although the bishops were overwhelming in their support for changes in church law to deal with priests found guilty of sexual abuse, Cardinal Bevil acqua said that the changes would not directly affect a great number of cases.
But the modifications would provide a "last resort," he said, strengthening the hand of a bishop when a priest found guilty of sexual abuse refuses to give up his duties voluntarily or resists effective treatment.
Bishops currently have the administrative power to remove priests from parishes or even suspend them from priestly functions. But to make such a suspension permanent against a priest's will requires a decision by a church tribunal.
The bishops asked the Vatican to raise the age defining minors in church law to 17 from 15. They also requested that the five-year statute of limitations on dismissals in church law be extended so that an under-age victim of sexual abuse could press charges for five years after reaching the age of 18, no matter when the abuse occurred.
A bishop could also press for dismissal of a priest up two years after receiving a new, well-substantiated allegation of abuse, regardless of when the abuse was said to have occurred.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Reporter's Notebook;
After Marathon of a Debate, A 6-Minute Dash to Settle It

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 --
By the 11th hour of debate, with lawmakers growing ever more emotional, with the vote described in ever more apocalyptic terms and with longtime allies and enemies strangely scrambled, the people's house seemed exhausted with the North American Free Trade Agreement.
They were ready to vote and they did it fast: The agreement went over the top in just 6 minutes and 11 seconds, a sharp contrast to the long cliffhanger of the President's budget vote in August.
 
Throngs in the Capitol
 Throughout the day and into the night the halls of the Capitol were filled with men and women for and against the pact, waiting in long, hot and often contentious lines for a chance to see and hear the debate. They heard Representative David Bonior, the Democratic whip from Macomb County, Mich., plead for a "no" vote on behalf of working people, while Representative Marcy Kaptur, a staunch opponent of the agreement from Ohio, quietly wept. 
 They heard Representative Robert H. Michel, the Republican leader and advocate of the pact, surprise his grim colleagues with a joke. "Think," he said, "of the three most famous nonelected opponents of Nafta: Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader -- the Groucho, Chico and Harpo of Nafta opposition." The House seemed grateful for the chance to laugh.
It was an exhausting struggle, perhaps especially for the Democrats, whose leaders seemed eager to nudge their divided party toward reconciliation. Representative Vic Fazio, the California Democrat who supported the agreement, tried for a healing coda: "None of us are owned by labor. None of us are coerced by business. And none of us are afraid of Ross Perot."
 
An Oscar Performance
 President Clinton and his Congressional supporters played the Oscar-quality underdog during the week leading up to tonight's vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement. But anyone who looked inside the offices of the lobbyists for and against the accord walked away with a different view of the fight.
The lobbyists supporting the agreement -- Chamber of Commerce types, accountants, trade consultants -- occupied a stately conference room on the first floor of the Capitol, barely an elevator ride away from the action in the House chamber. Murals plastered the ceilings outside. Weighty quotations ("We Defend and We Build a Way of Life Not for America Alone, but for All Mankind") were inscribed above every door. A television was installed. Cellular telephones were everywhere -- not clunky low-rent models, but the teeny ones that fold to the size of lemons. People carried about gift neckties with buttons attached, reading "Don't tie the economy in knots."
Celebrities, Washington-style, were in evidence. "It's going to be a blowout," said Anne Wexler, a former official in the Carter Administration who is now a lobbyist.
The boiler room for the forces opposed to the pact, by contrast, was more of, well, a boiler room. Set in the spectacularly ugly Rayburn House Office Building, in a barren hearing room of the Education and Labor Committee, it was two elevators, a subway and a long walk from the House debate. The dress was union-label, inexpensive suits and nylon jackets inscribed with numbers and insignias of various locals.
There was one telephone, decidedly not portable, and basic black. That fit the mood.
Asked whether the forces opposed to the pact had any neckties or other giveaways, Charles E. Stott, director of a four-state A.F.L.-C.I.O. region in the Midwest, was caustic. "We feel like there's been enough given away already," he said.
 
A Demolition Derby
 The first grand debate over the trade agreement was a confetti blizzard of assertions that the accord would strengthen industry or decimate it, create jobs or destroy them. Only one fact is indisputable: this country still produces the highest-quality sound bites, non sequiturs, cliches and malaprops on earth.
All day and most of the night, distinguished members of the House of Representatives took the floor to thumb their noses, direct raspberries and practically throw cats at each other, oratorically speaking. It is highly unlikely that they changed anyone's mind; barely two dozen lawmakers were officially undecided when the arguing began, and the number of genuine fence-sitters probably was much smaller.
The argument nevertheless riveted the gallery in the same way that stock-car 500's rivet throngs at Daytona: after a while, nobody cared much who won or lost. The thrill lay in waiting for someone to spin out of control and careen in flames into the barriers.
"You and I are both members of the Marine Corps," Representative Pat Roberts, a Republican of Dodge City, Kan., who supported the accord, admonished another lawmaker who had attacked it in rabid terms. "In the Marine Corps they teach you to shoot straight. You, sir, have fired the shotgun of fear at me, and I resent it."
Representative James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, cushioned his opposition with an assertion that xenophobia had nothing to do with it. "I used to work with a Mexican," he said.
"We all stand on the shoulders of giants today," said Representative Jim Moran, who backed the accord.
"I find it interesting how we get carried away by the dogma a la mode," said Representative Lincoln Diaz-Ballart of Florida, an opponent.
He apparently meant du jour, or of-the-day, not a la mode, which would imply that the pact was covered with ice cream.
 
Nasty and Nastier
 This was Mr. Clinton's third great House test of Presidential influence -- the first being his losing fight for $19 billion in deficit spending to stimulate the economy, and the second the hair's-breadth passage last August of his $500 billion package of tax and spending cuts. The previous two battles were waged by happy warriors, pumped with political adrenaline that left both winners and losers feeling good.
The fight over the trade accord was a nastier and more divisive battle, a class-lines split that cleaved both parties and left everyone feeling sullen.
The fracas reached its low point about 7 P.M., when four members of the environmental group Greenpeace rose from the gallery and, shouting "Not this Nafta," threw handsful of mock $50 bills onto the House floor below. According to a press release distributed by the group minutes later, the protesters were making the point that Mr. Clinton had bought support for the agreement through political favors to polluters and agricultural interests.
"The only thing free about Nafta is the amount of money passed around Washington to pass it," said Representative James Traficant of suburban Cleveland, repeating that charge.
Not so, said E. (Kika) de la Garza, the Texas Democrat who heads the Agriculture Committee. "We have taken care of ourselves," he said of the promises. "That's why we helped the American sugar industry, one that is providing these jobs that all the lawmakers are screaming about. That's what we're doing, and I'm proud of it."

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Perot;
Perot Looks at Loss on Pact and Says the Battle Has Just Begun

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Ross Perot said tonight that even though he was on the losing side in the trade agreement struggle and was also slumping in the polls, he was nevertheless just beginning to fight.
Starting Thursday morning, he announced, his political organization, United We Stand America, will step up its efforts to recruit new members nationwide, with the central goal of influencing the 1994 Congressional and 1996 Presidential elections. 
 Mr. Perot indicated, as he has a number of times, that his organization would attempt to punish legislators who supported the agreement. He also implied that he might become involved in other major national issues, like health care and unemployment. And he has left open the possibility that he might again seek the Presidency.
"Tomorrow will be the start of a new day," he said in an interview, looking fresh and primed despite spending 10 months campaigning coast to coast in his unsuccessful struggle to defeat the trade accord.
"Think of all of this as three votes," he said. "There's Nafta tonight. And then there's 1994 and 1996. You get my point?"
 
'No Personal Goals'
 If the two major political parties do not change direction in coming months and become more responsive to average voters, he warned, as he has before, United We Stand America could evolve into a third party, and he could again become a Presidential candidate.
"But that's up to the membership to decide, not me," he added. "I have no personal goals. I would prefer a strong, responsive two-party system. That's my dream. The thing that drives me is that I intend to leave this country in better shape than I found it because I've been so lucky myself."
Mr. Perot again refused to disclose how many members have already been signed up by United We Stand America, which was formed when he ran in the 1992 Presidential race, finishing with 20 percent of the vote. Nor would he disclose how much money his organization has raised or how much of his own personal fortune he has contributed to it.
By some estimates, he spent upward of $2 million of his $1 billion-plus personal fortune on the effort to beat the trade agreement.
"When the time is right, I'll release the figures," he said.
Because United We Stand America is registered as a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, it is not required by Federal and state laws to make public such figures.
 
Complaints From the Ranks
 Since last fall's election, and in particular since the trade agreement debate with Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Perot has slipped in the polls. Once viewed favorably by one of every two voters, he is now viewed favorably by one of every three.
Within his own political organization, some leaders of state and local chapters have accused him of autocratic rule. He denies the accusations.
Pollsters say voters tend to like many of Mr. Perot's ideas and to find his blunt espousal of them entertaining. But fewer and fewer voters view him as "Presidential," the pollsters report.
Specifically, the pollsters have found that voters agree with Mr. Perot about the need to run the Government more efficiently and about the need to reform Congress. But he loses much voter support when he focuses on matters like health care and, more to the point, foreign trade.
Two of every three voters polled shortly before tonight's vote said his stand on the agreement had not influenced them much, one way or the other.
 
'Voters Feel Bypassed'
 Whatever the case, in tonight's interview, Mr. Perot contended that the trade fight had left American voters more uneasy than ever about their Government and "beyond anger" at President Clinton and much of Congress. And he left no doubt that he and United We Stand America planned to exploit that unease and anger.
"Voters still feel bypassed and ignored and not understood," he said. "When was the last time ordinary people got involved in a foreign trade debate? Their anger is going to produce political change that will be something to see. People need good jobs and the treaty threatens them.
Mr. Perot called for a Justice Department investigation into President Clinton's effort to win votes for the trade agreement by promising to funnel Federal contracts and projects into the districts of House members who would commit to the proposal.
"They opened up the Treasury vault," he said. "That ought to be looked into."
Mr. Perot may have a difficult time making his vote-buying accusation stick. Throughout the nation's history, the White House and members of Congress have been striking such deals.
Mr. Perot also said that the White House had violated the Constitution by presenting to Congress an agreement that did not include everything that had been negotiated. "There were quite a few side agreements that were never put in what went to Capitol Hill," he asserted. "That's unconstitutional and something we also see as grounds for court action."
Because of a long and tangled history of White House treaty negotiations, Mr. Perot may also find this a difficult accusation to prove.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Reaction;
After Vote, Labor Is Bitter But Big Business Is Elated

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The House approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement drew a bitter reaction tonight from the labor unions that as recently as last weekend had seen victory within their grasp, and elation from the agreement's supporters in business and academia.
Members filed out of the House of Representatives angry or relieved depending on where they stood. Representative Cleo Fields, Democrat of Louisiana, seethed as he left the chamber a few minutes after he voted against the pact. "I hope the same folks who voted here and talked about job retraining will come back and vote for job retraining for the people dislocated by this agreement," he said, echoing the criticism of labor unions that believe the pact will cost hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
 Then, Representative Newt Gingrich, usually the most partisan of Republican leaders, proclaimed that the vote would usher in a new era of cooperation with the President.
 
Difficult Experience
 Inside the House chamber, the Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, lingered, talking mostly to his allies, clapping members on the shoulder. When he left the chamber, he told reporters, in a hoarse voice, "I think it's the right decision." But, he said, it was "a difficult experience for many of our members. This has been very divisive."
Even before the vote was over, some preprinted interpretation began to flow as aides to Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, and Lloyd Bentsen, the Secretary of the Treasury, passed out statements that were at once congratulatory and self-congratulatory.
Much of the comment talked about the rift the issue has created between the Administration and organized labor. Mr. Foley told reporters it been hard for him, and others, to break with labor.
For their part, union leaders seemed to have few thoughts of mending fences with their Democratic President, whom they criticized for what they called vote-buying and warned of political retribution.
 
Objections to Deals
 "The flurry of horse-trading surrounding the final push to enact this agreement has demonstrated what Nafta is really about," said Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
Ron Carey, president of the 1.3-million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s biggest union, echoed Mr. Kirkland's criticism. "The American people will be paying a price for all the perks," he said, referring to deals the White House struck with citrus fruits, wheat and other interests.
Mr. Carey made it clear that his union intended to follow through on the warnings it had given to House members favoring the pact. "Politicians who put the corporate special interests ahead of the public interest must be held accountable," he said. "We will develop political alternatives for 1994 and 1996 so that working people do not just have to choose between the lesser of two evils."
Moe Biller, president of the 249,000-member American Postal Workers Union, said of the House vote, "This is a good smack in the face." He, too, hinted of ballot-box retribution.
 
Quote From Tom Paine
 "I'll quote Tom Paine,' Mr. Biller said. "He said, 'The summer soldiers will shrink from their tasks, but those who stand it now will forever be honored.' We will honor those who stood fast."
But he equivocated a little, too. "It's hard to make a commitment for all time," Mr. Biller said. "Things change."
Away from the fax machines, some of the rank and file said they were disheartened by a vote they followed closely. As the second shift filed out of two General Motors parts plants in Detroit tonight, workers worried that highly paid manufacturing jobs like theirs were already vanishing and that the agreement would help their bosses ship the remainder abroad.
"It's going to make it easier for the companies, cheaper for them," said Curtis McGough, 40. "I got a 5-year-old son, he'll never see this place. I got nephews, they're in high school, they won't get in here."
 
What Mexicans Can Afford
 As he walked to his car, Michael Washington, a tool-and-die welder, said American exports would not rise because of the agreement because Mexicans simply could not afford the cars Detroit makes. Pointing at a battered Ford Crown Victoria, he asked: "Can they buy that car?" He answered his own question: "No."
Environmental groups were split in their reaction to the vote, as they had been by the pact itself. Barbara Dudley, the executive director of Greenpeace, an environmental group which strongly opposes the pact, attributed the agreement's approval to the Administration's deal-making. "The President went into high gear and auctioned off the country in the last couple days," she said tonight.
But officials at the National Wildlife Federation, which supported the agreement, took the opposite view. "Tonight, I am euphoric at the victory we've achieved for the economy and the environment," said Stewart Hudson, the federation's trade expert. "Without the environmental provisions, Nafta would not have survived."
The reaction from business was as pleased as that of the unions was bitter. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, hailed the vote as "a great victory for American industry, American workers and the American political process."
The chairman of General Motors, John Smith, said "By saying yes to Nafta, the U.S. House of Representatives has made good on a great window of opportunity for America. For the first time, American-made products will be able to compete fairly in Mexico without the burden of tariffs and other barriers."
Several executives and economists stressed what they saw as the positive effect of the vote on other trade issues. William Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, who had made television advertisements in favor of the pact, said passage of Nafta "demonstrated our country's commitment to expanded trade."
Jeffrey Schott, an economist at the Institute for International Economics here who supports the free trade pact, said the real significance of the 34-vote margin was in the likelihood that it would bring about an even larger free trade agreement in 116-nation talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 
Signs of Consensus
 "I'm pleased with the vote, but I think it really holds good promise for other trade agreements, particularly the GATT," he said. "It shows a strong bipartisan consensus."
On many minds was the effect of the Nafta fight on another issue, health care. With that in mind, Mr. Bentsen sounded a conciliatory note after the vote. "With Nafta behind us, we look forward to working with our friends on other issues on the American agenda, such as comprehensive health care reform."
But Mr. Carey predicted tougher going for the President's health care plan. The Teamsters originally sought a single-payer universal plan, with the Government providing care for all, not the President's managed competition approach. "We shifted to accommodate the President," Mr. Carey said. "But he has turned his back on us."
Without being specific, the president of the 143,000-member Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union, Jack Sheinkman, also warned that the vote tonight "is going to impact the kind of health plan we have."

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: The Partners' Reaction
Mexico Seems Jubilant but the Government in Canada Has Many Questions;
A 'Real Revolution Stirs Celebration

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 17

 BODY:
After the long Congressional debate ended and the final vote was taken on Mexico's economic union with the United States, many Mexicans celebrated the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"It's a major step for Mexico, absolutely enormous," said Juan de la Cruz, a 39-year-old banker who watched the vote on television at the Yuppies Sports Bar in downtown Mexico City. "It's like there were two walls between the countries and now they're gone." 
 "It's a real feeling of accomplishment," said Raul Munoz Leos, president of Dupont de Mexico, who was attending the Tchaikovsky Festival here. "This is the real revolution for Mexico, not the one in 1910. This has much more potential because it provides a real life model for what the world will be coming to."
The vote ended an often-frustrating period during which Mexicans were left to sit on their hands while their future was haggled over in Washington.
 
Divided Opinion in Mexico
 "I don't like to see decisions being made in the U.S. Congress alone," said Gabriel Szekely, a corporate consultant in Mexico City. "But its reality for most of the countries in the world." Still, he said he felt the agreement will mark an important point in North American history. "This gives us an opportunity that we can really have a close partnership with the United States, and gain from it. It's not certain that it's going to happen, but if there had been no Nafta that would not even be an opportunity."
At Los Pinos, the Mexican White House, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari gave a short, low-key speech in which he again downplayed expectations by calling the agreement just one step in Mexico's economic evolution.
Mr. Salinas called President Clinton's efforts to get the agreement approved "decisive," and said that Mr. Clinton had achieved "what only weeks ago was considered impossible."
Mr. Salinas said the Mexican Senate would vote on the agreement "in the coming days."
Even as it was being approved in Washington, the controversial agreement was dividing opinion in Mexico.
"We don't trust any agreement that President Salinas negotiated," said Jesus Guadelupe Peralta, an unemployed 32-year-old sugar worker from Heroico Cardenas in the state of Tabasco who has been camping in Mexico City's main square for a week to protest what he considers to be the Government's lack of social support. "It would be fine if the agreement brought U.S. salaries here, but it won't."
In many ways, the vote was seen by Mexican businessmen as a confirmation of Mr. Salinas's economic policies. During the day, Mexico's stock market dropped 10 points, as many investors decided to sell their holdings in the last pre-agreement session of the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores. The Bolsa index dropped .5 percent on heavy trading.
The number of people in Mexico who watched the debate is believed to be comparatively small because it was only carried by certain cable companies and the majority of Mexicans do not have cable television. Blanca and Hugo Cano, both 30, were strolling through downtown Mexico City when the vote was taken. The results didn't surprise them. "The rich people are going to benefit most, but I think that after the transition, my salary is going to go up by as much as a quarter," Mr. Cano said.

HEADLINE: Beijing May Seek a U.S. Trade Deal

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 17

 BODY:
President Jiang Zemin of China left for the United States today, having begun what Chinese and Western officials say is the boldest set of economic changes since China's opening to market forces began 15 years ago.
And some Chinese officials say they believe that Mr. Jiang, emerging from a highly successful meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee last weekend, may try to capitalize on his political momentum by asking the United States to separate China's trade status from its human rights record. He will meet with President Clinton in Seattle on Friday at a summit meeting of Pacific rim countries. 
 To strike such a deal, Mr. Jiang would have to make concessions that go further than China's commitment, restated today, to give "positive consideration" to permit the Red Cross to visit its 3,000 political detainees.
In a news conference at his departure today, Mr. Jiang said Chinese-American relations were at a "crucial juncture," and he appealed to Mr. Clinton to take a "long-term perspective" on the relationship and drop conditions on China's trade status. But he offered no clue as to how he might broach a new understanding.
 
A Sense of Urgency
 Some Western human rights workers say they believe China has been preparing a number of steps to improve its human rights record, including releases of political prisoners and new legal procedures under which prisoners can contest their treatment.
One element of urgency underlying Mr. Jiang's first trip to meet an American President is that the health of China's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, is rapidly deteriorating. A Western official who recently spoke with a senior Communist Party leader said he was told that the progressive nature of Mr. Deng's decline will make it impossible for his physicians to sustain him past February or March.
Mr. Jiang, 67, is the handpicked successor of the 89-year-old Chinese patriarch. "His political position at home is very strong right now," said one Chinese who was an adviser at last week's Central Committee debate. But Western officials fear that Mr. Jiang, an uncharismatic former Mayor of Shanghai, will not be able to assure political stability after Mr. Deng dies or insure that China's market remains open.
A foreign policy victory in Seattle would strengthen Mr. Jiang's position and solidify the reform trend.
 
One Step at a Time
 As the Chinese President left, details about the new economic program emerged. The package, a product of months of negotiation by the leadership, would overhaul China's banking and taxation systems.
But most important, it would allow some of China's state-owned industries to accept private investments. It would guarantee the protection of profits and the right of investors to take part in managing of companies, much like a corporation in the West.
A 25-page document issued by the Central Committee on Tuesday does not say when or on what scale this transformation will begin, but there are references to "step-by-step" approaches. "It should be adopted in a gradual manner after experiments," the Central Committee report states. "It must not be done for show, or rashly on a mass scale."
The document, drafted under Mr. Jiang's supervision, has charted a course that one Western diplomat called one of the boldest initiatives undertaken by the leadership since 1978. That was the year in which Mr. Deng, arguing before an earlier Central Committee, won support for the first steps of the economic program that China has pursued for 15 years.
The diplomat said these new steps are just as "fraught with the risks of social unrest" as the earlier ones, perhaps more so, as the new reforms will "break the iron rice bowls" in China's state-owned industries, where Communism, for 45 years, has guaranteed jobs and lifetime security without demanding performance.
 
Investing in Stability
 Social unrest poses the greatest threat to the Communist Party's monolithic control in China. The death of Mr. Deng will only deepen the regime's insecurity because in four decades of Communist rule, there has never been a planned handover of power that has succeeded.
Concern about political stability explains in part the speed with which China and the United States have been rushing this fall to repair relations frayed by disputes over human rights, trade and China's exports of high technology, including missiles.
American officials would seek to support and nurture any Chinese leadership that carries on Mr. Deng's reforms, and if the leader dies, that would be likely to delay or defer decisions to impose sanctions on China for human rights abuses, Western diplomats here believe.
For Mr. Jiang, his patron's illness also explains the frenetic pace with which he is using Mr. Deng's final days to endorse the new economic reforms. Before the party meeting, Mr. Deng issued a few sentences from his sickbed backing rapid development and high-speed growth.
These utterances effectively put an end to China's four-month-old austerity program under the management of Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, whose political star, for the moment, has crashed.
The Central Committee's blueprint reads more like Milton Friedman than Karl Marx: the "socialist market economic structure" now "aims at enabling the market to play the fundamental role" in how resources are allocated, it says.
For China's economy to keep growing at rates approaching this year's phenomenal 13 percent, the Chinese want political stability, and that will be part of Mr. Jiang's message in Seattle.
 
More Trust, Less Trouble
 In a speech on Monday to the World Affairs Council in Los Angeles, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, who will also be in Seattle, said, "China's desire is to have more trust, less trouble, increased cooperation and no confrontation with the United States."
A key element of political stability in Mr. Jiang's vocabulary is avoiding the train wreck he faces when Mr. Clinton links China's preferential trade status with China's record on human rights, which has gotten worse in some respects. Losing the preferential tariffs would stunt a third of China exports and wreak havoc in the economies of Hong Kong and Taiwan, both Washington's allies.
Access to the American market, where China may rack up a $20 billion trade surplus this year, is a key factor in guaranteeing China's future prosperity. And in China, as Mr. Deng has said, prosperity is the only thing that keeps the masses from rebellion against the Communist system.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Dealings;
New York Region 'Nays' Translate Into 'No Deals'

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
So while the deals were being struck on sugar and orange juice and peanut butter to round up last-minute Democratic votes for the free trade pact, how did the New York region do?
To begin with, most Democrats from the metropolitan area were out of the running. All but two Democrats from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- Nita M. Lowey and Floyd H. Flake -- opposed the pact, according to preliminary vote counts. 
 Ms. Lowey decided after much soul-searching to support the agreement, but she was proudly declaring, "No deals, no dams, no bridges." Meaning, her press secretary said, that she decided solely on the merits of the issue. "Nita made it very clear that she was not interested in getting anything for her vote," the aide, Howard Wolfson, said, "and she didn't solicit anything."
Ms. Lowey, who represents parts of Westchester, the Bronx and Queens, said that the pact adopted by the House tonight was "a good deal" for the metropolitan area and that if she did not believe it would create jobs and improve the New York economy, she would not have supported it.
Mr. Flake, of the Sixth District in Queens, met with President Clinton for 30 minutes on Tuesday and afterward said he would vote for the agreement.
The Congressman got "a philosophical commitment from the President to go forward with some community development initiatives," said Marshall Mitchell, Mr. Flake's spokesman. That includes more seed money for small businesses in distressed areas, Mr. Mitchell said.
Perhaps most important, Mr. Mitchell said, the President expressed his interest "in using the Sixth Congressional District as a crucible for experiments in economic empowerment."
Another longtime holdout like Mr. Flake was Representative Sherwood Boehlert, an upstate Republican who announced his support for the pact today.
"No deals," Mr. Boehlert said tonight.
But he added that he did tell the President that the Government was "the biggest disemployer in my district," citing cutbacks at Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome. Administration officials noted their past assistance to cushion that dislocation, Mr. Boehlert said, and promised continued cooperation.

HEADLINE: House Starts Surged 2.7% Last Month

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Responding to a revived housing market, builders broke ground on new homes in October at the fastest rate in more than three and a half years, causing analysts to raise projections for the economy at large.
The 2.7 percent rise in starts was the latest in what has become an almost unbroken streak of upbeat economic reports during the last two months, and it showed that housing, which showed little sign of life during the first half of the year despite tumbling interest rates, had resumed its traditional role as an economic pacesetter.
 
 
New Homeowners
 "Finally, we're getting pretty happy with these numbers," David Lereah, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said. He and others said that many apartment dwellers, inspired by the most favorable combination of financing costs and home prices in decades, had decided to become homeowners. 
 At a White House briefing, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen called the comeback in housing, to a level 13 percent above that of three months ago, "a payoff with what we did on the budget and getting the cuts in that deficit and now getting the long-term low interest rates."
Over all, starts ran at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1,396,000 in October, 14 percent above the pace a year earlier, the Commerce Department report showed. For single-family houses the gain was 5.8 percent, to a rate of 1,224,000.
The rebound in housing has lifted single-family construction back to the levels enjoyed during the 1980's. The 1.1 million houses now expected to be built in 1993 would be the most since 1,146,000 in 1987 and would be not far under the decade's best performance, 1,180,000 in 1986.
Because of a collapse in multifamily activity, however, current levels are far short of the 2.4 million total units in 1972, the industry's best year. The slump resulted from overbuilding, changes in the tax law and lower Government subsidies.
"Building activity seems clearly to be driven by the demand," commented David F. Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, noting that there had been relatively little speculative construction or rise in unsold homes. He added that all three of his association's own surveys -- of customer traffic, current sales and builders' expectations for future sales -- stood at the highest levels since they were introduced in early 1985.
Today's Commerce Department report, which exceeded most expectations, also showed that permits for future construction rose 2.8 percent last month, the fourth straight advance.
The October groundbreaking was concentrated in the Midwest, part of which is rebuilding from summer floods, and in the South. But while the Northeast and West posted small declines, both regions had brisk activity in preceding months. The number of permits issued in the Northeast, moreover, rose to the highest level of the year for the second consecutive month.
Starts surged to their third consecutive gain last month despite a 20 percent drop for apartment buildings. That sector, buildings with five or more dwellings, had soared 35 percent in September after the Government restored a lapsed tax credit for low-income housing.
 
 
Raising Estimates
 Besides buoying people in real estate, today's report also prompted some economists to raise estimates of the nation's total economic output for the fourth quarter.
According to Kenneth T. Mayland, economist at the Society National Bank in Cleveland, the residential sector should add as much as a percentage point to the growth rate of the gross domestic product in the final three months of the year after acting as a drag during the first six months.
"Four percent almost looks like a slam dunk," Mr. Mayland said, bumping his own forecast up a quarter-point today. The automobile business is strong, capital spending continues brisk and fourth-quarter output will also benefit from flood recovery and absence of crop losses, he added.
 
 
Existing-Home Sales
 Mr. Mayland also pointed to very strong recent reports on sales of existing homes and the fact that they are often accompanied by fix-up spending and the purchase of new appliances and other household goods. "This may partly explain why consumer spending is so strong despite the low confidence held by consumers," he said.
Most economists believe that kind of increase in growth cannot be sustained, raising the likelihood of a repeat of last year, when a 5.7 percent boom in the fourth quarter of 1992 was followed by a bare eight-tenths of 1 percent increase in the first quarter of 1993.
By region, starts last month were up 13.3 percent in the Midwest, to a rate of 358,000; up 2.8 percent in the South, to 590,000; down 9.4 percent in the Northeast, to 125,000, and down 2.4 percent in the West, to 323,000.
The report also showed that manufacturers shipped mobile homes at a rate of 251,000 in September, 2.4 percent higher than in August and 15.7 percent above the September 1992 pace.
Actual housing starts last month -- without seasonal adjustment or annualization -- were 124,700. Of these, 50,700 were in the South, 35,300 in the Midwest, 26,700 in the West and 12,000 in the Northeast.

HEADLINE: When Crime Was Bit of All Right in East End

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Ricky Precord and his friends were children when Reg and Ron Kray, London's most notorious gangsters, were sentenced in 1969 to prison terms of at least 30 years for the murders of two fellow thugs.
But like other residents of the East End, where the Kray twins ran protection rackets and fought ruthlessly to defend their turf, Mr. Precord and his mates share a communal nostalgia for the men who are arguably the best-known criminals to operate in their neighborhood since Jack the Ripper. 
 "They looked after their own," said Mr. Precord, proudly displaying card No. 51 in the Kray Supporters Club, as four of his friends, all in their 20's and early 30's, nodded in agreement. "Back in those days you could walk the streets. Old ladies didn't get mugged. They did a better job of keeping the streets safe than the Bill."
The Bill -- the police -- might beg to differ. But there is little doubt that among some East Enders, the Krays, who remain imprisoned, have come to embody a time more imagined than real when their neighborhoods were not so full of crime, unemployment and racial tension, and when criminals acting under a strict code of conduct dispensed justice and favors, Don Corleonelike, to maintain order.
"There's no doubt that if they hadn't gotten nicked, the East End would be a different place," said Dick Bowman, who said he had been a friend of the Krays for 35 years.
Mr. Bowman led several hundred fellow supporters of the Krays to Downing Street in October to present the Government with a petition seeking parole for Reg Kray. Mr. Bowman said he had 18,000 signatures.
Ron Kray, who always had a reputation as the more violent of the two, has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic; his chances for release from the Broadmoor psychiatric prison hospital rest with his doctors, and even the most fervid supporters of the twins said Ron may be better off under care.
In their heyday in the 1950's and 1960's, the Krays ran the closest thing to a crime empire that Britain had seen to that time. They built a fortune extorting "protection" money from business owners, demanding a cut from the proceeds of robberies committed by other criminals and other scams.
In the early 1960's they branched out into running legitimate nightclubs in the more stylish West End and took a page from the Mafia in the United States by developing and publicizing relationships with movie stars like George Raft and politicians like Lord Boothby, a minister in Winston Churchill's wartime Cabinet.
Neither their connections nor their flair for publicity helped in the courtroom. Ron Kray was convicted of murder in the slaying of a local hood who had insulted him because of his homosexuality. Reg Kray was convicted of murder in the death of Jack (The Hat) McVitie, another local criminal who owed them money.
But their penchant for the limelight has not let up since they entered prison. Both twins, now 60 years old, have written several autobiographies. They sold the rights to their story for $375,000 for the 1990 feature film, "The Krays." Through their supporters club, they sell T-shirts and "limited edition" family photo albums, and have spread tales of their good works, like providing money to poor and sick children. Celebrities like Roger Daltrey, the lead singer of The Who, have spoken out publicly in support of more lenient treatment.
The publicity has clearly helped promote the Krays' own view of themselves as victims of unduly harsh persecution by the police and the British establishment. Not that they deny the murders any longer. Rather, the Krays, and their supporters, feel that 25 years is an excessive amount of time.
But in a Britain where law and order issues have moved onto the center of the political stage, it is unlikely that the Government will be willing to release Reg Kray, much less his brother, under the glare of publicity and pressure, said John Pearson, author of "The Profession of Violence: The Rise and Fall of the Kray Twins."
"This isn't how these things are done in England," Mr. Pearson said. "They'd do better if they kept their heads down and did it quietly."

HEADLINE: 150 Windmills to Test Elusive Power Source

BYLINE: By WALTER SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Although the potential for using the wind to produce electricity has largely been untapped, a new initiative combining local and Federal resources could show that as much as 20 percent of the country's electrical power could be derived from this source by the year 2020, a leading proponent of wind power says.
The assessment was made by Dr. Edward DeMeo, who is in charge of wind and power energy at the Electric Power Research Institute, a national consortium of 700 utilities that is based in Palo Alto, Calif. 
 The institute recently joined with the Department of Energy to announce that three windy sites, in Texas, Vermont and Maine, had been chosen for a $40 million dollar program to test new wind turbines.
The plan is intended to help potential users of wind power judge if it can be economical.
The most ambitious of these wind farms will be on a ridge in northwest Maine, near the Canadian border. Dr. DeMeo said the initial plan called for 150 windmills.
The windmills will be built by Kenetech-U.S. Windpower to test its latest turbines, which produce maximum electricity even when winds are gusty. Their output will be sold to the Central Maine Power Company and other utilities. By 1995, they could produce 30 to 50 megawatts, with an ultimate goal of 250 megawatts, enough to supply a city of 100,000.
The second site, near Readsboro, in southern Vermont, will include at least 20 wind turbines, in a project sponsored by the Green Mountain Power Corporation. The utility will receive $3 million for construction and testing of an eight-megawatt plant. Since 1989, the company has been testing two turbines for performance in icy and harsh winters.
The third site, near Fort Davis in West Texas, where the weather is hot and dry, will consist of a six-megawatt plant with at least 20 windmills, run by the Central and South West Corporation, which operates utilities in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana and Arkansas. The design of the turbines to be tested at this and the Vermont sites has yet to be determined.
 
Experiment in Hawaii
 The diameter of the rotors on the windmills at the Texas site will be a little more than 100 feet. Each will generating more than 300 kilowatts.
Although these rotors are large, they are nowhere near the size of those on a giant windmill built under Federal auspices on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, which has blades longer than a football field. It has apparently not been successful enough for imitation.
In earlier turbines, Dr. DeMeo said, heavy gear boxes were used to adjust the speed of the generator, depending on wind velocity, to turn 1,800 times a minute. Now Kenetech-U.S. Windpower turbines can generate 60-hertz current from rotor blades spinning only 50 to 100 times a minute.
Meanwhile, a rival variable-wind turbine is being developed at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. The speed of the fan varies with wind strength, generating alternating current with varying cycles, or frequency. This power is electronically converted to direct current, which is then transformed to the 60-hertz frequency for the American power grid. Ultimately, the use of many widely scattered windmills is expected to cancel out any variations in the cycles.
Dr. DeMeo said the future of the Rensselaer system depended in part on whether the cost of the electronics and low-speed generators was less than that saved by eliminating the gears. At present, most of the nation's 17,000 wind turbines provide electricity at seven cents to nine cents a kilowatt hour, which is in line with other sources.
 
Cost Expected to Fall
 The cost is expected to approach four cents for most of the country by the end of this decade. A new Federal energy act will provide a subsidy of 1.5 cents a kilowatt hour, starting next year. Of the $40 million to be spent, Dr. DeMeo said, $6 million will come from the Department of Energy, $6 million from the institute and the rest from the participating utilities.

HEADLINE: Fed Proposes a Compromise On Access to Its Transcripts

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, offered a compromise today to Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking committee, saying the central bank would grant public access to detailed transcripts of meetings it held between 1976 and 1988.
Mr. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, had sought transcripts through 1990. He said in a news release tonight that he was disappointed with the Fed's decision and that the Fed's members were "greatly mistaken" if they thought the Banking Committee would be satisfied with the release of only "certain transcripts." 
 In a letter to Mr. Gonzalez, who is trying to make the Fed's deliberations less secret, Mr. Greenspan said that before making the transcripts available the central bank would clean up the grammar and edit out confidential material about private individuals, commercial banks and foreign central banks.
Mr. Greenspan said the Fed would make public transcripts of meetings of its main policy-making committee with a five-year lag.
Mr. Gonzalez had called for the release of complete transcripts of all meetings held more than three years ago and for releasing edited transcripts of meetings more than 60 days old but less than three years old.
Transcripts of meetings up to 1976 are already public; they were released after a five-year lag. Since 1976, however, the central bank has kept unedited transcripts of its policy-making meetings on file without making them public. Instead, it releases a short summary of its policy-making meetings six weeks after they are held.
The transcripts are of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee, which meets eight times a year and is instrumental in setting the central bank's interest-rate policies.
Opening them provides material for economists and historians about past economic and political controversies. For example, the transcripts are expected to show the debate that led to the Fed's decision to substantially raise interest rates in the early 1980's, shortly after President Jimmy Carter appointed Paul A. Volcker as Fed chairman.
In his letter, Mr. Greenspan argued against Mr. Gonzalez's suggestion that the central bank release transcripts with less than a five-year lag.
 
Free Discussion Called Vital
 He said that members of the committee believed "that early release of these documents would sharply curtail" the open market committee's "ability to discuss freely and frankly evolving economic and finanical market trends and alternative policy responses, which is essential to sound monetary policy."
Early release, Mr. Greenspan said, could stifle "originality, new ideas, and the give-and-take debate that so often open up new insights" at the committee's meetings.
Mr. Greenspan said that the Fed would make the slightly edited transcripts for 1988 available early next year and then release transcripts from previous years as the editing process proceeded.
 
Pressure Acknowledged
 The release of transcripts for all meetings and transcribed conference calls since 1976 should be complete within a few years, he said.
On Tuesday, Mr. Gonzalez released notes from participants in an Oct. 15 conference call organized by Mr. Greenspan with other Fed officials in preparation for a hearing on Oct. 19 of the House Banking Committee. In it the participants acknowledged that they felt pressures from a Department of Justice policy that created a presumption in favor of disclosing records that were more than five years old.

A Rally in Treasury Bonds Fizzles

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
An early rally in the Treasury bond market fizzled yesterday after an expected Federal Reserve purchase of Government securities failed to materialize.
Adding to the selling of Treasury issues was a sharp rise in gold and oil prices. 
 After rising about half a point in early trading, the price of the Treasury's 30-year bond closed down 8/32 of a point. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, edged up to 6.18 percent, from 6.16 percent late Tuesday.
The bond market rose sharply in early trading on wide optimism that the House would approve the North American Free Trade Agreement. American financial markets are expected to benefit from the elimination of trade barriers among the United States, Mexico and Canada, which would stimulate more foreign investment.
 
 
Korea Electric Power
 Also strengthening bond prices was strong demand for a $1.35 billion bond sale by Korea Electric Power, a utility in South Korea, the latest in this week's flurry of sales by corporations. Analysts said the demand spread through the Treasury market.
But Treasury bond prices began tumbling after the Federal Reserve failed to buy securities as expected around 1 P.M. as a way to replenish banking system reserves during the holiday shopping season.
The Fed was expected to buy $3.5 billion to $4 billion worth of Treasury securities, said Joseph Liro, chief economist at S. G. Warburg & Company.
A surprising spike in gold prices also weighed on bond investors, who view bullishness in gold as an indicator that inflation may be heading higher. After falling about $3 an ounce in early trading, gold for December delivery closed up $2.60 an ounce, at $377.20, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Higher oil prices also contributed to inflation fears. Crude oil for December delivery jumped 27 cents, to $17.04 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Inflation can hurt the value of long-term fixed-income securities such as bonds.
Peter McTeague, market strategist at Technical Data in Boston, said some investors used the negative news as an excuse to take profits on the earlier rise in bond prices.
 
 
Short-Term Maturities
 Prices of short-term Treasury maturities were unchanged to 1/32 point lower, while intermediate maturities were unchanged to 1/16 point lower.
The Lehman Brothers daily Treasury bond index, reflecting price movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.13, to 1,312.93.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 3.14 percent as the discount held steady at 3.08 percent. Six-month yields fell to 3.31 percent as the discount fell one-hundredth of a percentage point, to 3.22 percent. One-year yields dropped to 3.54 percent as the discount fell one-hundredth point, to 3.41 percent.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10213/32 , up 4/32 from late Tuesday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.60 percent.

Boeing Gets Order for 63 737-X Jets

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17

 BODY:
The Boeing Company said today that it had received an order from Southwest Airlines for 63 of its 737-X family of jetliners, the next generation of its best-selling Boeing 737.
The order, for delivery in 1997 through 2001, means the Seattle-based Boeing can now proceed with the introduction of the new aircraft. No price has been established for the 737-X, but the average $40 million price of current 737's would make the Southwest order worth about $2.5 billion. While the order will not have any near-term impact on earnings, it indicates that Boeing will remain competitive with Airbus Industrie in the crucial market for smaller jetliners, analysts said. 
 The order is recognition that Boeing is "the market leader in the one segment of the market which has long-term growth potential," said Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst with BT Securities in New York. "During this really dismal period for the industry, with orders being deferred and canceled, they're continuing to gain ground."
 
Shares Rise by $3.125
 The order announcement came after the close of the stock market, but Boeing shares gained $3.125, to $40.75, on the New York Stock Exchange today, as investors reacted to reports on news services that a pending announcement would be extremely positive.
The new order includes four 737-300X's for delivery in the fall of 1997, 16 in each of 1998 and 1999, 15 in 2000 and 12 in 2001. Of the 63 new orders, 32 result from the conversion of existing 737-300 options. Southwest's existing orders for 50 Boeing 737-300's for delivery in 1994-97 are unaffected by this order. Southwest's entire fleet of 157 aircraft consists of Boeing 737's.
Herb Kelleher, Southwest's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement: "We're delighted to once again be the launch customer for a Boeing aircraft. The current 737 models serve our high-frequency, short-haul operation very well. However, Boeing's business offer, combined with the additional attributes and operational flexibility of the 737-X, made the economics of this agreement superior."
Mr. Demisch said that Boeing's business offer to Southwest probably included "meaningful levels of support from General Electric," the sole engine supplier for the 737-X. These could include financing, special service arrangements or other considerations, he said.
The new 737 family is a derivative of the current 737, which features a modified wing with a larger span, and quieter, more powerful engines. Like today's 737-300/400/500 family, the next-generation 737 will be offered in three sizes. The 300X is the middle- size member of the new family, equivalent in capacity to the 737-300, which seats 128 passengers in mixed class and 137 in single-class configuration. The seating totals of the three models range from 108 to 160.

Morgan Stanley Buying Red Roof

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
The Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund said yesterday that it would buy Red Roof Inns, a private chain of 210 economy motels, for about $600 million.
Red Roof motels, all company owned and operated, are spread across 30 states but heavily concentrated in the Middle West. All but one are limited-service properties, offering only rooms, not restaurants, swimming pools or similar amenities, and they are aimed at the business traveler. 
 Such motels have generally weathered the recent recession in large part because business travelers, with their companies under pressure to cut costs, have been trading down from full-service to limited-service lodgings.
"The acquisition," said Paul D. Kazilionis, president of the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, "fits with our strategy of identifying and acquiring attractive real estate opportunities along with their successful existing managements."
The price paid for the chain's 23,443 rooms works out to about $25,500 a room, compared with a cost to build them new of about $35,000. The acquisition is effective Dec. 17.
 
No West Coast Properties

 
 Mr. Kazilionis said that while Red Roof was successful in the Middle West and Northeast, it had few properties in the Southwest and none on the West Coast. "We expect to expand in those markets," he said, "and we would be looking at acquisitions of smaller chains and individual assets."
Red Roof headquarters will remain in Hilliard, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus.
"This means the logjam in hotel asset sales has been broken," said Margo Vignola, lodging analyst for Salomon Brothers. "Red Roof is a healthy chain, not some distressed property." There has a been a surplus of hotel properties for sale since the late 1980's.
Rooms at Red Roof properties average $38 a night and the chain's occupancy rate this year is 81 percent. By contrast, through August of this year room rates at economy hotels have averaged $43.67 and occupany has averaged 63 percent, according to Smith Travel Research.
Founded in 1972 by James R. Trueman, Red Roof Inns -- owned by a private trust created by Mr. Trueman shortly before his death in 1986 -- grew steadily until about three years ago, when it viewed the market as saturated. The company grew from 101 to 194 units between 1983 and 1988, and has added only 16 units since, the last one in 1991.
The Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, founded in 1991, is a $840 million equity fund managed by a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. Its investments include Carmel Valley Ranch, a California resort purchased from the Resolution Trust Corporation for $18.3 million, and the Doral Telluride, a Colorado ski resort and hotel spa, purchased from a private developer for about $30 million. Both purchases, which occurred last summer, were part of a joint venture with Westcor Partners of Phoenix.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Evidence contradicts common sense in the trade tug-of-war.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHERE you stand on the free trade agreement, Bill Clinton told the country, is all about hope and fear -- hope that American industry can compete in world markets, fear that it can't. That struck many as good political oratory, good enough, perhaps, to tip the balance on the vote. What red-blooded member of Congress, after all, would suggest that Americans couldn't play in the big leagues?
But the idea of trade as the moral equivalent of football makes almost all economists uncomfortable. And it is downright dismaying to Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose own research, he readily acknowledges, has provided an intellectual rationale for those who portray international commerce as a competition in which their gain is our loss. "People who really know economics have lost control of the educated discourse," he glumly concludes. 
 In the catechism according to Adam Smith, individuals compete and businesses compete -- indeed, the core insight of free-market economics is that competition transforms selfish behavior into common good. But by the same token, competition between economies with different currencies has no real meaning.
Toyota, for example, may make sturdier, more reliable cars in Japan than Renault makes in France. And at current exchange rates between the yen and the franc, Toyota may be able to sell cars profitably in France for fewer francs than Renault can. But at the end of the day (well, year or decade) French exports must equal French imports, unless foreigners are willing to hold French i.o.u.'s indefinitely. And consumers in both Japan and France will be better off if they are given the choice of goods from either country.
That is not quite the whole story. If an economy is lucky enough to specialize in exports that the world particularly values, the foreign currency it earns will buy more imports. And what is loosely called the New Trade Theory suggests that smart countries may be able to make their own luck. If, for example, there is room in the world market for only one low-cost producer of computer microprocessors, being first in the market with a decent product may generate a financial windfall that will not be blown away by competition.
But theories that appeal to common sense (and serve special interests) have a way of thriving without much factual underpinning. Mr. Krugman calculates that changes in America's terms of trade -- how much our export earnings will buy abroad -- have accounted for a trivial percentage of the change in American living standards over the last half-century. Thus America's success (failure?) in trade "competition" is virtually irrelevant to the average American's income.
Averages, of course, are not everything. Doesn't international trade stir the pot, raising some people's incomes and lowering others'?
Yes, but so does domestic competition. If there is an intuitive truth to the populist suspicion about international trade, it must be that the burdens are systematically borne by people in no position to take the hit -- namely, unskilled workers. And, at least until the last few years, many economists assumed that the intuition was correct -- that the rapid opening of trade in manufactured goods had effectively forced blue-collar Americans to compete with their poorly paid counterparts in South Korea, Taiwan and -- dare we say it? -- Mexico.
The catch once more, though, is that the evidence does not support the self-evident truth. Lawrence Katz, the Labor Department's senior economist, estimates that competition with the bowl-of-rice-a-day crowd accounts for just a tenth of the change in the gap between the wages of America's skilled and unskilled workers in the 1980's.
If competition is virtually irrelevant to trade issues, why haven't economists who know better said so? "We used the word to get people's blood up," fudging the meaning in the name of advancing socially redeeming causes, Mr. Krugman said.
Van Doorn Ooms, the research director of the Committee for Economic Development, agrees. "I've used competitiveness as a synonym for productivity growth," said Mr. Ooms, who like many economists believes that Americans save too little and invest too little in human skills -- and need to be convinced to do better.
"Competitiveness means the ability to achieve trade equilibrium with a high level of wages," said William Baumol, the director of the C. V. Starr Center for Applied Economics at New York University. That may not be exactly what Joe Sixpack thought it meant, but it does lead to a virtuous policy prescription that sounds a lot like Mr. Ooms's.
"Paris is well worth a mass," the Duke of Sully is said to have counseled Henry of Navarre, a reluctant convert to Roman Catholicism. Mr. Krugman wonders whether economists, facing a similar problem, would not be better off sticking by their principles.
The doctrine of international competitiveness, he concludes, may spur politicians to do what ought to be done about domestic productivity. But to "win" a competition, America must, by definition, beat someone. "The obsession has led to trade conflict," Mr. Krugman says -- and it could lead to trade war.

HEADLINE: Soccer: Ins and Outs of '94 World Cup: Italy (In), England (Out);
France Beaten; Argentina and Ireland Qualify

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
It was soccer's version of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament, a throng of games played simultaneously, eight European vacancies available in the 24-team World Cup field, at least one shocker guaranteed. In the end, Italy and Ireland erupted in sweeping celebration, while France and England sank into national heartache.
Italy qualified for its ninth consecutive World Cup by defeating Portugal, 1-0, on a late goal by Dino Baggio in Milan, and delighting American organizers, who are paying attention to ethnic enclaves in the United States for next summer's tournament and are almost certain to place the Italians in the New York-New Jersey area at Giants Stadium. 
 Ireland also qualified, barely, by tying Northern Ireland, 1-1, in Belfast, and edging out the European champion, Denmark, by the tie breaker of total goals scored in the two-year qualifying process. Ireland scored 19 goals and Denmark 15 (each team had the same goal differential). Yesterday, Denmark was shut out, 1-0, by Spain, which finished first in Europe's Group 3 despite playing all but 11 minutes of the game without goalie Andoni Zubizarreta, who was ejected for a foul outside the penalty area.
 
Australia Is Defeated
 The final qualifying berth went to 1986 champion Argentina, which defeated Australia, 1-0, on a second-half goal by Gabriel Batistuta in Buenos Aires last night and made Diego Maradona, the redeemed superstar, eligible for his fourth World Cup.
No side experienced the humiliation and suffering of France, which will miss its second consecutive World Cup after surrendering a crushing goal in the final 10 seconds and losing a stunner to Bulgaria, 2-1, in Paris. Emil Kostadinov scored both goals for Bulgaria. France, which has twice finished third in the World Cup, was one minute away from qualifying on Oct. 13, but allowed a similarly late goal to weak Israel and lost at home, 3-2. There is good news for the 1998 World Cup, at least, France is the host and gets an automatic bid.
Another big loser -- this one expected -- was England, the acknowledged birthplace of the sport, which needed a loss by the Netherlands in Poland and a seven-goal victory margin of its own against lowly San Marino. The English surrendered a goal in the first 10 seconds after at weak back pass by captain Stuart Pearce, then recovered with four goals by Ian Wright for a 7-1 victory in Bologna, Italy, but it was insufficient. No victory, no matter how large, would have been enough, with the visiting Netherlands defeating Poland, 3-1, at Poznan on two goals by Dennis Bergkamp.
World Cup organizers are sorry to lose the tradition of British soccer, but are elated at having the problem of English hooliganism disappear before it could cross the Atlantic.
"The attachment of thugs to English football would have caused serious security problems," Alan Rothenberg, president of World Cup USA '94, said in a conference call from Milan. "Fortunately, they didn't qualify, but it's a mixed situation."
With England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland all eliminated, no British team will be represented at the finals for the first time since 1950.
Joining Italy, Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands and Bulgaria yesterday as the final European qualifiers were Switzerland, which clinched its first appearance since 1966 with yesterday's 4-0 victory over Estonia; Belgium, which will make its fourth-straight appearance after playing a man short for the final 50 minutes and getting a free-kick save by substitute goalkeeper Filip de Wilde in a scoreless tie against the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks in Brussels, and Romania, which sealed a back-to-back appearance with a 2-1 victory over Wales at Cardiff.
 
Welsh Fan Dies
 An elderly Welsh fan was struck and killed at Cardiff by a firecracker that shot across the field into the stands after the Romanian victory, The Associated Press reported.
On Dec. 19, at the World Cup draw in Las Vegas, Nev., the 24-team field will be seeded and divided into six four-team groups. The six No. 1-seeded teams are the defending champion, Germany; the host, the United States; the three-time winners Italy and Brazil; the two-time winner Argentina, and Belgium.
 
Luck of the Draw
 "The expression is, 'I'd rather be lucky than good,' and I think the field shows we're very lucky in the U.S.," Rothenberg said. "We're going to have a great mixture of most of the great soccer nations of the world, those that have tremendous fan following and appeal to a large ethnic population. At the same time, we have a smattering of Cinderella teams. Almost no country that I was really anxious to see here didn't make it."
The tournament will be played from June 17 to July 17 at stadiums in or near Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Orlando, Fla., San Francisco and Washington.
The United States will be based in Detroit and Los Angeles, with the Germans in Chicago and Dallas. Ireland will most likely be placed in Boston.
Three nations will be making their first appearance in the cup final: Greece, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. The absence of England, Japan and France, and the presence instead of such poorer Eastern European countries as Bulgaria and Romania, could have a negative financial impact on the World Cup in terms of merchandising and money spent by visitors. But Rothenberg stuck by the $4 billion estimate that the cup is expected to pump into the United States economy.
"Our overall economic status remains as valid as it ever was," he said.

HEADLINE: Nonproliferation Nonsense

BYLINE: By Jose Goldemberg; Jose Goldemberg, a visiting professor at Princeton University, is a former Secretary of Science and Technology in the Brazilian Government.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's new nonproliferation policy reopens the Pandora's box of proliferation around the world at a time when it is slowly being closed.
The policy, unveiled in September, states that the U.S. will "not oppose" programs by Japan and Western Europe to keep producing plutonium, a weapons-grade material, for civilian use, while it will seek to discourage such activity in "regions of instability and high prospective risk." 
 Plutonium separated from spent Japanese fuel in European reprocessing plants will be sent back to Japan to be used to fuel a $5 billion prototype breeder reactor that burns and produces more plutonium. By the year 2000, Japan will have its own large reprocessing facility to separate plutonium from spent fuel; more importantly, it will have a large stockpile of plutonium ready for use in weapons.
Why should Japan be permitted to produce plutonium while developing countries like Brazil are considered suspect when they set up plutonium reprocessing or uranium enrichment facilities?
To imply that Japan is more trustworthy than they are rekindles deep concerns in developing countries about the discriminatory character of American policy.
That policy will strengthen the hand of those in developing countries who have urged their leaders to acquire nuclear weapons at a time when important progress has been achieved in gaining universal adherence to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
How can military establishments and their civilian allies be persuaded that while they are denied the right to enrich uranium and produce plutonium they are not giving up important technologies for production of energy in the future?
Tokyo is not prepared to forgo such technologies even though Japanese leaders and scientists know that reprocessing nuclear fuel to recover plutonium as an energy source makes no economic sense. It will only serve as a political justification for the heavy investment in nuclear facilities already made.
What if the mounting stockpile of plutonium is eventually converted to military use? Such suspicions are frequently cast on many "near-nuclear-threshold" developing countries. What differentiates Japan from them?
A more acceptable course of action for the Administration would be a nondiscriminatory nuclear policy in which all countries would indefinitely forgo reprocessing of spent fuel to produce plutonium.
This would not hurt the prospects of the nuclear industry and would insure that civilian programs do not feed military ambitions.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: The New York Region;
Businesses Say Most Jobs Now Exist In Industries Trade Accord Will Help

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Though labor unions and many small manufacturers are braced for the worst, economists and business people generally predict that New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will benefit far more from the North American Free Trade Agreement than the region will be hurt by losing jobs to low-wage Mexican workers.
 Seldom has a region of America undergone a more profound economic transformation than these three states. Over a generation or so, they have moved from an economy fueled by factory production to one dominated by banking and finance, law and accounting, publishing and entertainment, telecommunications and advanced research in fields like pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. 
These are the cornerstones of what economists call the information economy, as vital today as were the steel mills, railroad yards and garment lofts of yesteryear.
 "On balance, the entire metropolitan region will benefit," said Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat, whose district covers parts of Westchester, the Bronx and Queens. She said she expected the region's banking, telecommunications and service concerns to flourish under the trade pact.
 These are the industries, already adept at global business and eager for more, that even opponents of the agreement acknowledged would benefit most by exploiting new markets in Mexico.
 What's more, Mrs. Lowey said, whatever manufacturing jobs are drained from the region would be lost with or without the accord. "The defeat of Nafta would not prevent manufacturers' cutting jobs," she said before the vote.
 For many of the region's enterprises, the issues that have dominated the national debate over the trade agreement -- the impact of reduced Mexican tariffs on American goods and the threat that factories will move south of the Rio Grande -- are not the telling provisions of the accord. The crucial provisions will strengthen the protections for copyrights and other "intellectual property" and eliminate some restrictions that Mexico imposes on United States ownership of Mexican subsidiaries.
 Indeed, some publishers, pharmaceutical companies and computer makers -- all trying to cope with piracy of the copyrighted material and technology they export to Mexico -- say the new rules to protect intellectual property are paramount.
 Banks and Wall Street securities firms, which will probably draw more benefit from the pact than any other businesses, say they are itching to buy Mexican businesses or invest in them.
 To be sure, semi-skilled production workers across the region have reason for worry. Even if the pact does not create direct inducements for their employers to leave, the new competition from Mexico's expanding manufacturing base seems likely to worsen the financial troubles that have closed hundreds of plants.
 In the last five years, according to Federal data, the region has lost one million jobs, with the deepest cuts coming in the manufacturing industries that will remain most vulnerable to foreign competition. Those losses followed 25 years of decline.
 In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where 12.6 million people work, the shrunken assortment of manufacturers that still survive now employ fewer than 1.8 million workers.
 
Poor Industries to Get Poorer
 By contrast, the industries that can expect a boost from the trade agreement, including banks, insurance companies and other service companies, employ more than 4.8 million people.
 The accord is expected to worsen the problems of many communities already staggered by lost factory jobs and pockmarked with abandoned plants. Few will toast the pact in the once-vibrant brass and textile towns of central Connecticut, in the old steel and machinery-producing cities of western New York, or in the New Jersey cities of Edison, Trenton and Linden, where Detroit's auto assembly operations long paid the rent.
 "As an American, I am in favor of Nafta, but as a businessman, I know it's going to hurt," said Justin Israel, the owner of Knitwaves Inc. His Manhattan clothing company has manufactured in Brooklyn for 43 years and never made a stitch abroad.
 Mr. Israel said that he was certain that some New York competitors would set up production in Mexico, and that the region's garment makers would experience even more severe competition. "You don't need to employ brain surgeons to make apparel," he said.
 
Auto Losses Inevitable
 In basic manufacturing, auto executives say, production will move to Mexico, as it has before. For the region's auto makers, textile workers, metal fabricators, foundry workers and other production ranks, job losses are inescapable -- as they would be even without the agreement, industry executives say.
 The Linden General Motors plant has cut its work force in half, to 2,500 from 5,500, since 1985. But it has survived while the major auto companies are abandoning North Tarrytown, Syracuse and Trenton and have already shifted large-scale production to Mexico and other countries.
 According to job data, these days the region's two largest manufacturing industries are publishing, which stands to benefit from the trade agreement, and chemicals, based largely in New Jersey. Publishers employ 220,000 people in the region, and chemical companies, 189,000.
 Executives in chemicals say they expect few job losses, largely because the cost of moving the plants would far exceed savings from lower wages.
 "It costs $80 million to build a catalytic converter, and if you've got one in New Jersey you are not going to build a new plant in Mexico," said Hal Bozarth, executive director of the Chemical Industry Council of New Jersey, a trade group.
 But in textiles, "the people most at risk in this industry are predominantly women, blacks and Hispanics," said Herman Starobin, research director for the International Ladies Garment Workers Union in New York City, where 80,000 workers make clothing. "These are people who need the jobs most."
 But high technology is a different story.
 As president of Locknetics Inc., a company in Bristol, Conn., that makes the card-activated locks for computerized building security systems, James J. Scott said competition from companies paying low wages in Mexico would be nothing new.
 
'Control We Have Here'
 "We already have competitors in Taiwan," he said, adding that his company had just built a new plant in Bristol and had no plans to move. "The advantage we have is the control we have here and the quality we produce."
 Like most high-technology manufacturers in the region, Mr. Scott says the agreement will benefit his company: by stimulating the Mexican economy, it will increase demand for his products in Mexico's airports, universities, factories and office buildings.
 Another benefit for high-technology concerns like I.B.M., based in Armonk, and more than a dozen major pharmaceutical companies will be the requirements that the Mexican Government protect patents and intellectual property.
 Because it often takes more than 10 years to bring a drug to market, "protecting intellectual property is critical to us," said Kevin Cogan, a spokesman for Merck & Company, the nation's largest drug maker. If the agreement expands markets for its products in Mexico, he added, the company, based in Rahway, N.J., may well increase its investment and jobs in the state.
 
Securities Firms Interested
 Marc E. Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Association said there would be other benefits, adding, "It will be terrific for New York employment, because so much of it is based in and around finance." .
 Longstanding Mexican prohibitions on American companies' having majority interests in Mexican companies, will be eliminated under the accord. Mr. Lackritz said several securities firms are considering acquiring or opening subsidiaries in Mexico.
 The only American bank that now has a wholly owned Mexican subsidiary is Citibank, with five branches in Mexico that it opened in 1929, before foreign ownership was restricted.
 Now, Citibank plans to open more. "And the overall growth in Mexican prosperity will help us more," said Jack Morris, a Citibank spokesman.The bank plans to expand its credit card business with Mexican customers, leading to an expansion of its United States credit processing operations.
 
Closer to Clients
 A vast assortment of professional service firms, from management consulting and public relations to law and marketing, are poised to seek new business in Mexico.
 Many law firms also have long experience with foreign clients and hope to lure more in Mexico. While they are likely to attract clients who need assistance in international business law, they will also seek lucrative new business in the enforcement of Mexican environment laws and in the revised intellectual property rights the pact calls for.
 Besides creating a larger market in Mexico, the trade accord will also provide critical copyright protection and help reduce recurrent piracy, including mass duplication of books and magazines and brisk sales of re-recorded records and home videos.
 "This is one of those industries that is not moving out of the New York area," said Donald D. Kummerfeld, president of the Magazine Publishers of America, representing 220 publishers, most of them in this region."Nafta is not a big thing for us, but it is a plus," he added.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: News Analysis;
A High-Stakes Gamble That Paid Off

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
In July, Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington confided to a diplomat that he thought the North American Free Trade Agreement was dead and that there was nothing he or President Clinton "or anyone on the planet" could do to revive it.
In August, a top Clinton aide said, the private judgment of most senior members of the White House staff was that the President should abandon the trade accord, doing the best he could "to cover his tracks." 
 But Bill Clinton pressed on, growing more rather than less committed as the days passed. Abandoned by two of the three top Democratic leaders in the House, opposed by usually reliable Democrats in the trade unions and by some important leaders of minority groups and environmental organizations, he kept shoving more and more chips into the pot on an issue that few Americans really understood.
 
Against the Odds
 It paid off handsomely. Mr. Clinton worked harder, Mr. Foley said, "than any President I've seen, on any issue, and I've been here 30 years." Against all the odds, with unlikely conservative allies, he forged a surprisingly comfortable majority -- a coalition with more Republicans than Democrats.
Politically, it was the most important achievement of his Presidency. He looked not like Jimmy Carter, tripping and slipping in his relations with Congress, but like the Lyndon B. Johnson of 1964 and 1965: relentless and resourceful, a fighter and not a fumbler.
Mr. Clinton retreated early on Bosnia, on Haiti, on homosexuals in the military, on important elements of his economic plan; he seemed ready to compromise on all but the most basic provisions of his health-care reforms. Critics started asking whether he had a bottom line on anything.
On the trade accord, he did, and that question won't be asked much for a while.
 
President as Deal Maker
 The President's smashing success this week sends him to Seattle on Thursday for the Pacific Rim summit conference with something quite substantial to back up his advocacy of free trade, and likewise gives him leverage in the stalled global trade talks.
In the end, Mr. Clinton won because he made deals, yes; that is what Presidents have always done, when they could. He collected votes because he twisted arms, yes; that, too, is a time-honored practice. (When Henry F. Ashurst of Arizona, a formidable Senate figure from 1912 to 1941, changed his vote on a fiercely disputed bill, a colleague congratulated him on having seen the light. "I didn't see the light," he replied. "I felt the heat.")
But Mr. Clinton also turned the House in his direction because he skillfully repackaged the issue.
"We learned something from Ronald Reagan, finally," said an Administration strategist. "You need to be right on more than the merits of the case; you need to be right on the presentation. We started to do better when we got off statistics and cast it more broadly -- shining city on the hill, you know -- as a choice between the future and the past, optimism and pessimism, hope and fear, embracing the modern world and trying to hide from it."
Mr. Clinton won support, too, because his much-maligned staff turned in a sterling performance that garnered praise from a tough jury on Capitol Hill. A Democrat who fell into line only this week commented tonight, "The gang that couldn't shoot straight must have been taking a lot of target practice over the summer."
Howard Paster, the chief White House liaison with Congress, used to lobby for organized labor, which was on the other side this time. But he was praised by his peers, as were Rahm Emanuel, another key White House staff member, and William Daley, the son and brother of Chicago mayors, who was brought in especially to help on this issue.
Finally, Mr. Clinton won because he dared to gamble, not only in campaigning for the pact when it seemed doomed but in sanctioning the debate between Vice President Al Gore and Ross Perot. It was not his idea to start with; it was cooked up in the Vice President's office, where any chance to speak for the Administration is welcome. But Mr. Clinton bought it, Mr. Gore delivered, and the impact seems to have been considerable.
No one can be certain, especially after the hyperbolic talk of the last 10 days, precisely what the economic impact of the agreement will be once it wins Senate approval. Opponents warned that it would cost a half-million jobs in the next five years; advocates boasted that it would create a quarter-million jobs. Economists tend to doubt both figures, and they point out that those numbers are relatively small, anyway, compared with the 4.9 million new jobs that the American economy is expected to create by 1998.
 
Seen as Economic Boost
 Still, the success of the trade measure, coming as it did a few months after the passage of the President's budget, is seen in the White House as further help for the current economic recovery. Administration economists and some of their academic colleagues think the economy is already doing better than any one statistic shows, and they hope the trade pact will help to keep the curve rising.
There were certain bills to be paid for the approval of the accord.
One was the bewildering series of side deals that were made to win votes this week, some of them unabashedly protectionist corollaries to a free-trade theorem. Tariff barriers were built to protect peanut growers and wheat farmers and orange-juice producers, among many others. They meant that free trade would not be quite so free as it might have been, but more walls came down this week than went up.
Another was the damage to the Democratic coalition. No doubt feelings were hurt and alliances strained. Some voters may have been permanently alienated, especially if their jobs go to Mexico; some will turn to Mr. Perot. But legislative politics is ultimately about interests, not emotions, and the unions, for example, will likely come back into the fold on the big issues that lie ahead, like health care.
That, of course, is the next legislative mountain to be climbed (although the Clinton Administration has already climbed more hillocks than generally noticed, including national service, student loans and family leave). If the trade accord required considerable statecraft in assembling a coalition bit by laborious bit, health care will require two or three times as much. But at least Mr. Clinton has gained credibility, through his tenacity on the trade pact, that will help him in the months ahead.
Can the White House sustain a legislative campaign for that long? Will the staff perform as it did on the accord or as it did in the travel office fiasco? And, above all, can Mr. Clinton avoid the kind of foreign-policy blunders that have recently plagued him and threatened to throw his Presidency permanently off course?
"This is a great victory," said Robert S. Strauss, the longtime Democratic power broker. "But if he's going to be re-elected, Clinton has to learn to focus on domestic and foreign policy at the same time. He can't be just a domestic-policy President any more than George Bush could be just a foreign-policy President. The country expects the President to handle both."

HEADLINE: After the Layoffs, Checks in the Mail

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
More than a year after the last red Chevrolet Camaro rolled off the assembly line at the General Motors plant northwest of downtown, about 1,200 workers laid off from the plant spend their days sleeping late, watching soap operas, taking classes, planting gardens, working out at the gym and, in one instance, learning to surf. Yet every week they continue to receive paychecks from G.M.
Under an unusual provision of the labor agreement between the company and the United Automobile Workers union, the plant's workers will continue to get those checks for up to three more years unless they agree to take a temporary job, move to another G.M. plant hundreds of miles away or opt to retire. 
 G.M. is now trying to figure out a way to stop the giveaway by putting the employees to work at temporary jobs or by offering them sweetened retirement packages, or in the case of younger workers, buyouts.
So far, the workers have had little incentive to retire. G.M.'s retirement benefits do not currently pay as well as the program that pays idle workers for doing nothing.
Three years ago, Robert C. Stempel, who was then G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, offered to pay people to stay home. The U.A.W. liked the provision, which made it "as uneconomical as possible for companies to lay off people," said Frank Joyce, a U.A.W. spokesman. The provision cost the world's largest auto maker more than $3 billion from 1990 to 1993 while it rang up a $17 billion loss in North America. Many experts think the provision was one reason Mr. Stempel lost his job last year.
This fall, G.M. dearly wanted to eliminate or at least limit the giveaway when it negotiated a new contract. But the U.A.W. shrewdly chose to bargain first with the Ford Motor Company, where it won increases in the company's contribution to long-term layoff funds. Ford cared little about the cost of the program, since it had already closed its unnecessary plants and would not be laying off workers permanently.
By the time it was G.M.'s turn to bargain, the Ford contract had set a pattern that G.M. could not break without a costly strike. In the end, G.M. wound up committing more money to the layoff funds than it had in 1990 -- nearly $4 billion more over three years -- even though its workforce had shrunk by tens of thousands of workers.
Besides the plant here, situated in the Van Nuys area of the San Fernando Valley, workers at G.M. plants in North Tarrytown, N.Y.; Wilmington, Del., and Ypsilanti, Mich., are also drawing pay for staying home, but Gerald A. Knechtel, G.M.'s vice president of North American operations, singles out the Van Nuys situation as "a particularly emotional situation among our plant closures."
That is because G.M. first moved car production to Canada and promised the workers that they would be given another model to build. Then, as G.M.'s market share declined, the company announced that it would close the 46-year-old plant. So now it has come up with a series of incentives -- and even some temporary work making seat covers -- to either get the remaining workers off the payroll or keep them productive.
 
 
'Going Crazy'
 At first glance, being paid to be laid off seemed like a dream come true for Terri Varela, 56, who worked for 18 years as a polisher at the Van Nuys plant. She now gets about $1,700 a month, compared with the $2,000 she was paid before being laid off.
But after a year of living leisurely, Ms. Varela and other laid-off workers are starting to have second thoughts. "I'm going crazy," she said. "It's getting to the point where I sit here for hours saying, 'What am I going to do today?'
"I have no sense of what I'll be doing six months from now. I guess I would rather be working full time."
Paying workers for not working is not new in the auto industry. As long ago as the mid-1950's, Detroit auto makers paid workers during temporary plant closings, for slowing production or retooling for new models. When the industry began closing plants and eliminating jobs in the 1980's, additional programs began offering workers payments that provided from 50 to 95 percent of workers' pay, when combined with Government unemployment benefits.
In recent interviews, many laid-off workers from the Van Nuys plant said that they had searched for new jobs in the last year but that they were unsuccessful mainly because of the weak Southern California economy. In addition, they said, many employers refused to hire them when they learned that they were former G.M. employees who were receiving nearly full pay.
 
 
Waiting for the Mail Carrier
 John Dominguez, 41, worked as an electrician at the Van Nuys plant for 22 years, but after a year of being laid-off and receiving G.M. checks, he says he now knows how it feels to be on welfare. "The money is great, but it's demeaning," Mr. Dominguez said. "Just sitting around waiting for the mailman is very frustrating, especially when you have some skills to offer but no job."
For four hours a day, Mr. Dominguez attends a trade school, paid for by a fund set up by the company and the union, where he is studying to become an air-conditioning technician. The rest of the day, he says, he looks in vain for a new job and worries about his future.
When the Van Nuys plant closed in August 1992, many of the 2,707 workers who were laid off began receiving 85 to 100 percent of their gross pay, which averaged about $700 a week here, because of the union-negotiated program. About 600 workers later retired and 300 accepted jobs at G.M. plants in 10 states.
The program enabled laid-off workers to receive all of their wages if they went to school full-time or did community service work, though there is no evidence that the workers were asked to do anything.
But at the end of February, the fund that was created in 1990 ran out of money and the workers were shifted to another program. Through a combination of company-paid benefits and state unemployment compensation, that program enables the workers to receive what they say is about 70 percent of their gross pay.
 
 
Vouchers for New Cars
 Now, after failing at the bargaining table, General Motors is going out of its way to get the workers off its payroll. As part of the new U.A.W. contract, G.M. is offering sweeteners for the Van Nuys workers -- and idle workers at North Tarrytown, Wilmington and Ypsilanti -- to elect early retirement or leave the company voluntarily.
Union officials say one retirement option of the new contract allows retirees to collect a full pension and still work full time at another job without having their G.M. benefits reduced. G.M. would also give these retirees a $10,000 voucher toward the purchase of a new G.M. car or truck and up to $4,000 for taxes and registration fees.
As an alternative, for those who agree not to earn more than $15,500 a year at another job, G.M. is offering a $15,000 voucher toward a new car, plus $6,000 for taxes and license fees.
Finally, for workers at the Van Nuys plant who do not qualify for retirement now, G.M. is offering up to $100,000 if they leave G.M. voluntarily.
 
More May Now Retire
 Ray Knudson, a trustee at the U.A.W.'s Local 645, said that at least half of the Van Nuys plant workers were eligible for retirement, but that many had delayed retiring to keep receiving the more generous weekly paychecks. Mr. Knudson said that while it was still too early to tell, he thought many workers eligible for retirement would now take advantage of the sweetened benefits.
After 31 years at the Van Nuys plant, Salvador Torres, a 50-year-old mechanic, said he planned to retire to receive the $10,000 voucher and $4,000 cash, which he will put toward either a Pontiac Grand Prix or a Chevrolet Astro van.
Mr. Torres, who currently attends automotive school from 8 A.M. to 3 P.M., where he learns to repair cars other than G.M.'s, said he hoped to find a part-time job to supplement his pension, which he estimates will be $1,830 a month.
When he is not in school, Mr. Torres says he spends his free time helping his wife with housework, fixing his children's cars, coaching Little League and running marathons. "Under the circumstances, I feel quite lucky," he said. "I've had an extended vacation this past year, and now I can get on with my life."
The Van Nuys plant, a 100-acre operation built in 1947, at various times churned out Chevrolet trucks, Monte Carlos, Chevelles and Novas, as well as Oldsmobile Omegas and Pontiac Venturas. G.M. moved the plant's last remaining vehicles, Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds, to a newer plant in St. Therese, Quebec, as part of a cost-cutting move.
 
Retraining Classes
 Currently, the Van Nuys plant sits idle most of the day, except between 6:30 A.M. and noon, when 80 laid-off employees show up for a retraining program jointly run by the company and union. Classes in reading, math, grammar and computer skills are taught by teachers from the Los Angeles schools.
Leaving a computer class at the G.M. plant last week, Ismael Barba, 55, said that after 37 years as a tool maker for G.M., he realized he could not compete for other jobs because he was not "computer literate."
Mr. Barba, who said he now received $600 of the $800 a week he made before being laid off, planned to spend the rest of the day as he usually did, visiting his parents and doing housework.
"Having free time is not all that people think it's cracked up to be," he said. "After going to school half the day, it's not easy going out and finding a job."
Even G.M. executives at the vacant plant seem to have plenty of time on their hands. A man who identified himself as a plant official was spotted last week tending to the rows of yellow, pink and red roses that line empty parking lots at the plant. He declined to answer any questions.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: News Analysis;
A High-Stakes Gamble That Paid Off

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 17

 BODY:
In July, Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington confided to a diplomat that he thought the North American Free Trade Agreement was dead and that there was nothing he or President Clinton "or anyone on the planet" could do to revive it.
In August, a top Clinton aide said, the private judgment of most senior members of the White House staff was that the President should abandon the trade accord, doing the best he could "to cover his tracks." 
 But Bill Clinton pressed on, growing more rather than less committed as the days passed. Abandoned by two of the three top Democratic leaders in the House, opposed by usually reliable Democrats in the trade unions and by some important leaders of minority groups and environmental organizations, he kept shoving more and more chips into the pot on an issue that few Americans really understood.
 
Against the Odds
 It paid off handsomely. Mr. Clinton worked harder, Mr. Foley said, "than any President I've seen, on any issue, and I've been here 30 years." Against all the odds, with unlikely conservative allies, he forged a surprisingly comfortable majority -- a coalition with more Republicans than Democrats.
Politically, it was the most important achievement of his Presidency. He looked not like Jimmy Carter, tripping and slipping in his relations with Congress, but like the Lyndon B. Johnson of 1964 and 1965: relentless and resourceful, a fighter and not a fumbler.
Mr. Clinton retreated early on Bosnia, on Haiti, on homosexuals in the military, on important elements of his economic plan; he seemed ready to compromise on all but the most basic provisions of his health-care reforms. Critics started asking whether he had a bottom line on anything.
On the trade accord, he did, and that question won't be asked much for a while.
 
President as Deal Maker
 The President's smashing success this week sends him to Seattle on Thursday for the Pacific Rim summit conference with something quite substantial to back up his advocacy of free trade, and likewise gives him leverage in the stalled global trade talks.
In the end, Mr. Clinton won because he made deals, yes; that is what Presidents have always done, when they could. He collected votes because he twisted arms, yes; that, too, is a time-honored practice. (When Henry F. Ashurst of Arizona, a formidable Senate figure from 1912 to 1941, changed his vote on a fiercely disputed bill, a colleague congratulated him on having seen the light. "I didn't see the light," he replied. "I felt the heat.")
But Mr. Clinton also turned the House in his direction because he skillfully repackaged the issue.
"We learned something from Ronald Reagan, finally," said an Administration strategist. "You need to be right on more than the merits of the case; you need to be right on the presentation. We started to do better when we got off statistics and cast it more broadly -- shining city on the hill, you know -- as a choice between the future and the past, optimism and pessimism, hope and fear, embracing the modern world and trying to hide from it."
Mr. Clinton won support, too, because his much-maligned staff turned in a sterling performance that garnered praise from a tough jury on Capitol Hill. A Democrat who fell into line only this week commented tonight, "The gang that couldn't shoot straight must have been taking a lot of target practice over the summer."
Howard Paster, the chief White House liaison with Congress, used to lobby for organized labor, which was on the other side this time. But he was praised by his peers, as were Rahm Emanuel, another key White House staff member, and William Daley, the son and brother of Chicago mayors, who was brought in especially to help on this issue.
Finally, Mr. Clinton won because he dared to gamble, not only in campaigning for the pact when it seemed doomed but in sanctioning the debate between Vice President Al Gore and Ross Perot. It was not his idea to start with; it was cooked up in the Vice President's office, where any chance to speak for the Administration is welcome. But Mr. Clinton bought it, Mr. Gore delivered, and the impact seems to have been considerable.
No one can be certain, especially after the hyperbolic talk of the last 10 days, precisely what the economic impact of the agreement will be once it wins Senate approval. Opponents warned that it would cost a half-million jobs in the next five years; advocates boasted that it would create a quarter-million jobs. Economists tend to doubt both figures, and they point out that those numbers are relatively small, anyway, compared with the 4.9 million new jobs that the American economy is expected to create by 1998.
 
Seen as Economic Boost
 Still, the success of the trade measure, coming as it did a few months after the passage of the President's budget, is seen in the White House as further help for the current economic recovery. Administration economists and some of their academic colleagues think the economy is already doing better than any one statistic shows, and they hope the trade pact will help to keep the curve rising.
There were certain bills to be paid for the approval of the accord.
One was the bewildering series of side deals that were made to win votes this week, some of them unabashedly protectionist corollaries to a free-trade theorem. Tariff barriers were built to protect peanut growers and wheat farmers and orange-juice producers, among many others. They meant that free trade would not be quite so free as it might have been, but more walls came down this week than went up.
Another was the damage to the Democratic coalition. No doubt feelings were hurt and alliances strained. Some voters may have been permanently alienated, especially if their jobs go to Mexico; some will turn to Mr. Perot. But legislative politics is ultimately about interests, not emotions, and the unions, for example, will likely come back into the fold on the big issues that lie ahead, like health care.
That, of course, is the next legislative mountain to be climbed (although the Clinton Administration has already climbed more hillocks than generally noticed, including national service, student loans and family leave). If the trade accord required considerable statecraft in assembling a coalition bit by laborious bit, health care will require two or three times as much. But at least Mr. Clinton has gained credibility, through his tenacity on the trade pact, that will help him in the months ahead.
Can the White House sustain a legislative campaign for that long? Will the staff perform as it did on the accord or as it did in the travel office fiasco? And, above all, can Mr. Clinton avoid the kind of foreign-policy blunders that have recently plagued him and threatened to throw his Presidency permanently off course?
"This is a great victory," said Robert S. Strauss, the longtime Democratic power broker. "But if he's going to be re-elected, Clinton has to learn to focus on domestic and foreign policy at the same time. He can't be just a domestic-policy President any more than George Bush could be just a foreign-policy President. The country expects the President to handle both."

HEADLINE: U.S., in Stern Terms, Warns North Koreans on A-Arms

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 17

 BODY:
Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned North Korea today to open its nuclear installations to international inspection or face punishment, probably in the form of economic sanctions.
Mr. Christopher made his remarks before meeting with Chinese officials to enlist their aid to get North Korea to comply with the treaty to halt the spread of nuclear weapons. 
 In a speech at the University of Washington, Mr. Christopher said the United States preferred to deal with North Korea's refusal to allow inspection of its nuclear plants through diplomacy. But he added that if North Korea continued to refuse, the United States would recommend that the United Nations impose sanctions.
In order to avoid such action, Mr. Christopher said, North Korea must agree to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency and resume talks with South Korea on fulfilling an agreement between the two countries to keep the Korean peninsula free of nuclear weapons.
 
Words of Warning
 "If North Korea refuses the necessary inspections and refuses to resume a dialogue with South Korea on nuclear issues, then we are prepared to recommend that the United Nations Security Council consider options other than negotiation," he said.
The warning differs little in tone from President Clinton's nearly two weeks ago. But coming on the eve of a summit meeting by the 15 members of forum on Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, it underscores the importance of the issue to the Administration.
Mr. Christopher's warning also came a few hours before he is to meet with Qian Qichen, the Chinese Foreign Minister. In an interview this week, the Secretary of State said he intended to stress the need for cooperation in putting pressure on North Korea.
"It will be important to have Chinese understanding and support for what we're doing in this present diplomatic negotiation," Mr. Christopher said, "and it's important to have their understanding and support if it's neccessary -- which we hope it won't be -- if we go back to the United Nations Security Council."
 
Frustration in Washington
 China is one of the few countries that exert any influence on North Korea, one of the world's most isolated nations. Chinese cooperation will also be essential if an economic embargo is placed on North Korea, since the two countries share a long border.
Mr. Christopher's stern tone reflects a growing frustration in the Administration over North Korea's continued refusal to allow inspections of its nuclear research installation, about 60 miles north of Pyongyang.
In addition, North Korea has refused to allow inspection of a site near the reactor complex where officials from the atomic energy agency suspect nuclear wastes have been dumped. Inspection of the suspected dump site is critical to determining if North Korea has diverted plutonium from its reactor to use in nuclear weapons.
Rather than allow inspections, North Korea announced in March that it intended to withdraw from the non-proliferation treaty.
Mr. Christopher's tone contrasted sharply with a more concilatory message coming from South Korea. While warning of the dangers of a North Korea with nuclear weapons, senior South Korean officials have stressed the need for continued negotiations.
The South Korean officials, speaking on the condition that they nat be identified, say talks should continue unless the international agency determines that North Korea is no longer in compliance with the non-proliferation treaty. The South Korean President, Kim Young-sam, is to travel to Washington after the summit meeting here and is expected to confer with Administration officials on North Korea.

HEADLINE: After the Layoffs, Checks in the Mail

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
More than a year after the last red Chevrolet Camaro rolled off the assembly line at the General Motors plant northwest of downtown, about 1,200 workers laid off from the plant spend their days sleeping late, watching soap operas, taking classes, planting gardens, working out at the gym and, in one instance, learning to surf. Yet every week they continue to receive paychecks from G.M.
Under an unusual provision of the labor agreement between the company and the United Automobile Workers union, the plant's workers will continue to get those checks for up to three more years unless they agree to take a temporary job, move to another G.M. plant hundreds of miles away or opt to retire. 
 G.M. is now trying to figure out a way to stop the giveaway by putting the employees to work at temporary jobs or by offering them sweetened retirement packages, or in the case of younger workers, buyouts.
So far, the workers have had little incentive to retire. G.M.'s retirement benefits do not currently pay as well as the program that pays idle workers for doing nothing.
Three years ago, Robert C. Stempel, who was then G.M.'s chairman and chief executive, offered to pay people to stay home. The U.A.W. liked the provision, which made it "as uneconomical as possible for companies to lay off people," said Frank Joyce, a U.A.W. spokesman. The provision cost the world's largest auto maker more than $3 billion from 1990 to 1993 while it rang up a $17 billion loss in North America. Many experts think the provision was one reason Mr. Stempel lost his job last year.
This fall, G.M. dearly wanted to eliminate or at least limit the giveaway when it negotiated a new contract. But the U.A.W. shrewdly chose to bargain first with the Ford Motor Company, where it won increases in the company's contribution to long-term layoff funds. Ford cared little about the cost of the program, since it had already closed its unnecessary plants and would not be laying off workers permanently.
By the time it was G.M.'s turn to bargain, the Ford contract had set a pattern that G.M. could not break without a costly strike. In the end, G.M. wound up committing more money to the layoff funds than it had in 1990 -- nearly $4 billion more over three years -- even though its workforce had shrunk by tens of thousands of workers.
Besides the plant here, situated in the Van Nuys area of the San Fernando Valley, workers at G.M. plants in North Tarrytown, N.Y.; Wilmington, Del., and Ypsilanti, Mich., are also drawing pay for staying home, but Gerald A. Knechtel, G.M.'s vice president of North American operations, singles out the Van Nuys situation as "a particularly emotional situation among our plant closures."
That is because G.M. first moved car production to Canada and promised the workers that they would be given another model to build. Then, as G.M.'s market share declined, the company announced that it would close the 46-year-old plant. So now it has come up with a series of incentives -- and even some temporary work making seat covers -- to either get the remaining workers off the payroll or keep them productive.
 
 
'Going Crazy'
 At first glance, being paid to be laid off seemed like a dream come true for Terri Varela, 56, who worked for 18 years as a polisher at the Van Nuys plant. She now gets about $1,700 a month, compared with the $2,000 she was paid before being laid off.
But after a year of living leisurely, Ms. Varela and other laid-off workers are starting to have second thoughts. "I'm going crazy," she said. "It's getting to the point where I sit here for hours saying, 'What am I going to do today?'
"I have no sense of what I'll be doing six months from now. I guess I would rather be working full time."
Paying workers for not working is not new in the auto industry. As long ago as the mid-1950's, Detroit auto makers paid workers during temporary plant closings, for slowing production or retooling for new models. When the industry began closing plants and eliminating jobs in the 1980's, additional programs began offering workers payments that provided from 50 to 95 percent of workers' pay, when combined with Government unemployment benefits.
In recent interviews, many laid-off workers from the Van Nuys plant said that they had searched for new jobs in the last year but that they were unsuccessful mainly because of the weak Southern California economy. In addition, they said, many employers refused to hire them when they learned that they were former G.M. employees who were receiving nearly full pay.
 
 
Waiting for the Mail Carrier
 John Dominguez, 41, worked as an electrician at the Van Nuys plant for 22 years, but after a year of being laid-off and receiving G.M. checks, he says he now knows how it feels to be on welfare. "The money is great, but it's demeaning," Mr. Dominguez said. "Just sitting around waiting for the mailman is very frustrating, especially when you have some skills to offer but no job."
For four hours a day, Mr. Dominguez attends a trade school, paid for by a fund set up by the company and the union, where he is studying to become an air-conditioning technician. The rest of the day, he says, he looks in vain for a new job and worries about his future.
When the Van Nuys plant closed in August 1992, many of the 2,707 workers who were laid off began receiving 85 to 100 percent of their gross pay, which averaged about $700 a week here, because of the union-negotiated program. About 600 workers later retired and 300 accepted jobs at G.M. plants in 10 states.
The program enabled laid-off workers to receive all of their wages if they went to school full-time or did community service work, though there is no evidence that the workers were asked to do anything.
But at the end of February, the fund that was created in 1990 ran out of money and the workers were shifted to another program. Through a combination of company-paid benefits and state unemployment compensation, that program enables the workers to receive what they say is about 70 percent of their gross pay.
 
 
Vouchers for New Cars
 Now, after failing at the bargaining table, General Motors is going out of its way to get the workers off its payroll. As part of the new U.A.W. contract, G.M. is offering sweeteners for the Van Nuys workers -- and idle workers at North Tarrytown, Wilmington and Ypsilanti -- to elect early retirement or leave the company voluntarily.
Union officials say one retirement option of the new contract allows retirees to collect a full pension and still work full time at another job without having their G.M. benefits reduced. G.M. would also give these retirees a $10,000 voucher toward the purchase of a new G.M. car or truck and up to $4,000 for taxes and registration fees.
As an alternative, for those who agree not to earn more than $15,500 a year at another job, G.M. is offering a $15,000 voucher toward a new car, plus $6,000 for taxes and license fees.
Finally, for workers at the Van Nuys plant who do not qualify for retirement now, G.M. is offering up to $100,000 if they leave G.M. voluntarily.
 
More May Now Retire
 Ray Knudson, a trustee at the U.A.W.'s Local 645, said that at least half of the Van Nuys plant workers were eligible for retirement, but that many had delayed retiring to keep receiving the more generous weekly paychecks. Mr. Knudson said that while it was still too early to tell, he thought many workers eligible for retirement would now take advantage of the sweetened benefits.
After 31 years at the Van Nuys plant, Salvador Torres, a 50-year-old mechanic, said he planned to retire to receive the $10,000 voucher and $4,000 cash, which he will put toward either a Pontiac Grand Prix or a Chevrolet Astro van.
Mr. Torres, who currently attends automotive school from 8 A.M. to 3 P.M., where he learns to repair cars other than G.M.'s, said he hoped to find a part-time job to supplement his pension, which he estimates will be $1,830 a month.
When he is not in school, Mr. Torres says he spends his free time helping his wife with housework, fixing his children's cars, coaching Little League and running marathons. "Under the circumstances, I feel quite lucky," he said. "I've had an extended vacation this past year, and now I can get on with my life."
The Van Nuys plant, a 100-acre operation built in 1947, at various times churned out Chevrolet trucks, Monte Carlos, Chevelles and Novas, as well as Oldsmobile Omegas and Pontiac Venturas. G.M. moved the plant's last remaining vehicles, Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds, to a newer plant in St. Therese, Quebec, as part of a cost-cutting move.
 
Retraining Classes
 Currently, the Van Nuys plant sits idle most of the day, except between 6:30 A.M. and noon, when 80 laid-off employees show up for a retraining program jointly run by the company and union. Classes in reading, math, grammar and computer skills are taught by teachers from the Los Angeles schools.
Leaving a computer class at the G.M. plant last week, Ismael Barba, 55, said that after 37 years as a tool maker for G.M., he realized he could not compete for other jobs because he was not "computer literate."
Mr. Barba, who said he now received $600 of the $800 a week he made before being laid off, planned to spend the rest of the day as he usually did, visiting his parents and doing housework.
"Having free time is not all that people think it's cracked up to be," he said. "After going to school half the day, it's not easy going out and finding a job."
Even G.M. executives at the vacant plant seem to have plenty of time on their hands. A man who identified himself as a plant official was spotted last week tending to the rows of yellow, pink and red roses that line empty parking lots at the plant. He declined to answer any questions.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Some see bargains among the stocks of close-out stores.

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson

 BODY:
DURING the recession, penny-pinching shoppers learned to hunt for discounted brand-name goods at close-out stores. Although the economy now appears to be recovering, such stores continue to thrive, making up a $5 billion segment of the general retailing industry.
Some retail analysts say investors too can find a bargain among stocks of close-out retailers, which buy distressed goods when manufacturers produce too much or make mistakes with a product. Close-out stores sell the goods at steep markdowns compared with traditional retailers.
The Consolidated Stores Corporation, Mac Frugal's Bargains Close-Outs Inc., Value City Department Stores Inc., Tuesday Morning Inc. and Value Merchants Inc. are retailing's scavengers. Their bare-bones stores are stocked with goods in last year's colors, items labeled for test markets, unsold factory inventory, orders canceled by cash-short department stores, products in old wrappers and food whose shelf life is near its end. 
 Analysts who follow these deep-discount merchants recommend Consolidated Stores, by far the largest in the niche. The Columbus, Ohio, company had sales of $929 million last year from 381 stores operating under the Big Lots and Odd Lots names, as well as from 160 All for One stores.
Shares of Consolidated closed at $21 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The price is relatively expensive because it is about 17 times analysts' estimates of earnings for the year ending Feb. 1, 1995.
The close-out business is growing twice as fast as the 5 percent growth rate of retailing in general. Yet stocks in a broader retail index sell for 14 times expected earnings for fiscal 1995, Thomas H. Tashjian, an analyst for First Manhattan, said.
If Consolidated's stock price seems high, true bargain hunters can consider the shares of Mac Frugal's, the industry's pioneer. Its shares have been trading around $16 after hitting a peak of nearly $20 in June.
But Mac Frugal's sales and profit momentum stalled soon after a period of rapid growth in the late 1980's, when expenses got out of hand. A turnaround has been held back by a prolonged recession in Southern California, which seemingly would help sales but has not. Mac Frugal's, based in Dominguez, Calif., has 81 of its 205 stores in the region. Sales were $540 million in 1992.
But David H. Batchelder, a member of a dissident shareholder group that forced a restructuring of Mac Frugal's in 1990, says the stock of the company is undervalued compared with its primary competitor.
Mac Frugal's closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $16.625 -- a price to earnings multiple of 10 for the year ending Feb. 1, 1995.
"The market is betting that Consolidated can sustain its earnings growth in fiscal 1993 and into 1994," Mr. Batchelder said. This fiscal year, to meet analysts' estimates of 95 cents a share, Consolidated must outperform the previous year's results for the second half by 30 percent. "That's a very aggressive assumption," said Mr. Batchelder, who is a Mac Frugal's director and holds about 50,000 shares.
Mac Frugal's needs at least an 18 percent increase in second-half earnings to meet analysts' earnings forecasts. "Mac Frugal's has an opportunity to outperform the market's expectations," he said.
Mr. Tashjian of First Manhattan is skeptical of the prospects for such strong growth, noting that Mac Frugal's sales rates for stores open at least a year are not growing.
Dana Telsey, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence, said Consolidated, rather than Mac Frugal's, would benefit from current consumer preferences. Consolidated has a reputation for making shrewd buying sorties; for example, it swiftly acquired discontinued apparel from the Sears catalogue, lifting its sales for September by 8 percent.
Mac Frugal's is better known for its array of imports. "Consumers want to buy the same brands they did in the 80's but can't afford in the 90's," she said.
Although manufacturers have become more efficient in recent years, resulting in fewer overruns of products, buyers for close-out chains still find plenty of merchandise to scoop up. "Humans make mistakes," said Howard Snyder, co-owner of Odd Job Trading, a privately held close-out store.

HEADLINE: U.S. Will Allow Computer Sale To Court China

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
In a good-will gesture toward China, the Clinton Administration has agreed to sell it a sophisticated $8 million supercomputer, senior Administration officials said today.
The decision is part of the Administration's strategy to embrace rather than isolate China despite disagreements over human rights, weapons proliferation and trade. The Clinton Administration is determined to grab an ever-larger share of China's market, the fastest growing in the world, and reduce a trade deficit that could exceed the one with Japan by the end of the decade.
 
G.E. Stands to Profit
 Even more significant for American business, the Administration has also decided to lift the ban on important components for China's nuclear power plants, like generators, senior Commerce Department officials said. That could mean billions of dollars in sales for the General Electric Company, which has begun to break into China's burgeoning nuclear power market. 
 But the decision to go forward with the supercomputer sale is strategically more important because it signals the Administration's willingness to sell high-technology equipment to Beijing.
The Administration was also eager to give a lift to the financially troubled company that makes the computer, Cray Research Inc.
The decision was relayed to China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, by Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Seattle on Wednesday. Senior White House officials said today that it had not been decided whether Mr. Clinton would announce the supercomputer decision, as well as other parts of the economic package, after he met with China's President, Jiang Zemin, in Seattle on Friday.
The Administration decided to allow the sale despite clear evidence that China has broken its promises to Washington by exporting M-11 missile components and technology to Pakistan. Those exports violated an international missile control accord.
The computer is for use in weather prediction by China's State Meteorological Administration. Although there has never been a statutory ban on the supercomputer sale, the Bush Administration postponed the sale last December after intelligence reports showed that China had exported the M-11 technology. But in the final days of his Administration, Mr. Bush overruled the Defense Department and ordered the approval of a license pending necessary processing.
That put the decision on the desk of Mr. Clinton, who had accused Mr. Bush in the Presidential campaign of not doing enough to halt the spread of nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic missile technology.
In informing Mr. Qian on Wednesday, Mr. Christopher did not ask for any concessions from Beijing.
"There was no linkage," a senior Administration official said. "The only thing we wanted to be sure of was that we weren't running up against any U.S. export restrictions."
 
China May Get Satellites
 Mr. Christopher also told Mr. Qian that the United States would be prepared to interpret an American law governing the export of high technology to China to allow the export of two of the seven sophisticated American-made satellites banned by sanctions imposed on China in August, senior Administration officials said.
But the Administration could offer such a gesture only if China opened formal talks on the sanctions and its missile sales, which thus far it has refused to do, arguing that the sanctions had to be lifted first.
Mr. Qian showed some flexibility, saying that the Chinese were willing to study entering into such consultations, the officials said.
In August, as required by American law, the Administration imposed sanctions on an estimated $1 billion in high-technology trade, including a ban on the export of the seven satellites, after American intelligence agencies produced conclusive proof that China was continuing to ship M-11 technology and equipment to Pakistan in violation of the accord known as the Missile Technology Control Regime. The law only covers sanctions against the Chinese companies involved in weapons transfers and therefore does not apply to the supercomputer.
 
Some Experts Are Opposed
 Some Administration experts, particularly in the Defense and Energy Departments, argued against sale of the supercomputer, saying it would give China important new technology that could help its nuclear and ballistic missile development.
Senior officials involved in the decision insist that the supercomputer will be sent under strict conditions, including substantial American monitoring, that will prevent its diversion for military uses.
But some Pentagon officials and key lawmakers disagree. When informed of the Administration's decision, Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, who has opposed the sale, said in a telephone interview: "It's a mistake. We have to be firmer with China, and that's what China will respect. We should not be sending that kind of high-tech equipment to any nation that continues nuclear explosions."
After China broke an informal nuclear-testing moratorium and exploded a nuclear weapon last month, Senator Simon sent a letter to President Clinton urging the Administration to withhold the supercomputer and other sensitive high-technology sales until Beijing guaranteed that it would not conduct more tests.
 
U.S. Appeals Disregarded
 A Pentagon official involved in proliferation issues said: "There are technical difficulties putting in safeguards. And if the Chinese manage to use the supercomputer in a weapons program, no one's going to go in there and pull the plug."
The official also questioned lifting of the ban that would make it easier for China to build nuclear power plants, since China has disregarded American appeals to end its nuclear cooperation with Iran.
Until now, the United States has not sold Beijing any computer with a speed of more than 70 million calculations per second. By contrast, the Cray supercomputer has a speed of 958 million calculations per second. Even with that capacity, China would have only about one-twentieth of the computing power of advanced nations.

HEADLINE: CLINTON NOW TURNS TO WIDENING TRADE ACROSS THE PACIFIC

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Hoping to build on his triumph with the North American Free Trade Agreement, President Clinton arrived here today vowing to open new markets in the Pacific. He immediately ran into obstacles from Asian officials who say the world's most booming economies are not yet ready for free-trade zones of their own.
"We come here today hoping to drive down trade barriers, open up tradeopportunities and promote more growth," Mr. Clinton said after arriving at Boeing Field here. 
 Before leaving Washington, Mr. Clinton said Vice President Al Gore would travel to Mexico to meet with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, probably next week, to discuss carrying out the trade accord. And the President and the Congressional Democrats who opposed him on the trade pact moved to find common cause on other issues, including health care. [Page A27.]
 
A Three-Day Meeting
 The President and his aides have hailed the three-day summit meeting, the first time that Asia's leaders have ever gathered in one place, as an historic moment to accomplish what past administrations have often talked about but never succeeded in carrying out: redirecting American foreign policy toward the Pacific. Mr. Clinton's focus is on a fledgling regional trade group called the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum that embraces countries as diverse as Australia, Indonesia, Japan and Canada.
But Mr. Clinton and his aides have made it clear that they hoped to use the economic group as a vehicle to create a sense of political community that has never existed amid the rivalries and competing cultures of Asia, hoping it will clear trade barriers in the markets that Mr. Clinton views as the key to job growth in the United States.
"Make no mistake about it, ultimately this meeting is about the jobs and futures and incomes of the American people," the President said, talking to employees at Boeing Corporation, America's largest exporter and Seattle's biggest employer.
Mr. Clinton, speaking to a cheering crowd of Boeing workers, never mentioned the huge layoffs that the aircraft manufacturer has made in recent months or the accusations by some of workers that the company, by striking up relatiohships with manufacturers in China and Japan, is effectively exporting jobs in order to sell planes.
 
'Not Enough Growth'
 Mr. Clinton said the main problem in the American economy "is there's not enough growth in the world economy," and added, "We're going to change that, beginning at this meeting for the Pacific region."
But that same agenda is the source of concern among many of the Asian leaders Mr. Clinton is meeting, who say they fear the American President is trying to turn the group into a powerful trade weapon that will undercut their own economies.
Today, in the first concrete action since officials began meeting here earlier this week, foreign ministers from the 15 nations agreed to allow in three more members: Mexico, Papau New Guinea and Chile. President Salinas of Mexico does not plan to attend the meeting in Seattle, however, though Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada will be here.
But even the move for new admissions touched off controversy, with Australia and several of the Southeast Asian countries expressing fears that the economic corporation would lose its regional flavor by including Latin American nations. Officials said an agreement was reached to bar the entry of any new members for at least three years, while the group better defined its mission.
"You have to think of this a bit like being at a NATO meeting in 1950," a senior aide to Secretary of State Warren Christopher said today, as foreign ministers from the nations of the Asian-Pacific forum met here to develop what Mr. Christopher has termed a "vision statement" for an Asian community. "Only there is no common enemy, and uncertainty about what the common economic objective should be."
 
Indonesia Leads Objectors
 That became clear this morning, when several nations, led by Indonesia, whose labor costs and per capita income are among the lowest in Asia, expressed clear objections to several specific proposals to turn the consultative body into a formal trade organization, with free-trade areas, procedures for settling disputes among members and uniform criteria for accepting foreign investment.
"It's fair to say that there are a variety of concerns, especially among the developing nations, that we proceed with some caution," said Nobuo Matsunaga, a former Japanese Ambassador to the United States and Tokyo's special envoy to the Asian-Pacific froum. Japan has cast itself as something of a mediator between the Asian countries and the Western members of the organization, although many nations suspect that it, too, is not eager for free trade zones in a region Japanese companies have come to dominate.
In recent days Washington has backed away from its earlier efforts to use the meeting to declare the birth of an Asian-Pacific Community; so far is the group from such pronouncements that it still refers to its "member economies" for fear that terms like "nations"' would prevent China and Taiwan from joining the group.
 
Action on GATT Sought
 For now, American officials say, they will be satisfied if this week's meeting results in Asian pressure on Europe to clear the considerable obstacles to concluding years of negotiations over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The deadline is Dec. 15, when Mr. Clinton's negotiating authority, granted by Congress, runs out. Part of the Administration's strategy is to use the specter of an Asian trading agreement as a spur -- some say a threat -- to the European Community, particularly France, to make the agricultural concessions needed to conclude the GATT negotiations, called the Uruguay Round.
A senior Administration official said today that a statement to be issued by the Asian-Pacific ministers on Friday would probably contain a specific reference to agricultural subsidies. It is unclear how Japan, whose continuing but crumbling ban on rice imports remains an obstacle to an agreement, might try to water down that statement.
"We want them to know that while we all want GATT, there are other options we have with Asia," an American official said here earlier this week.
Privately, both American and Asian officials say the bruising Nafta debate left them doubtful that broad trade agreements with Asia could ever survive the kind of scrutiny accorded the agreement with Canada and Mexico. The issues and questions of job security raised in the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement pale in comparison with the challenges of Asia's economies, which include both high-tech trading powers like Japan and low-wage manufacturing giants like China.
 
Pressure for Plant Sites
 Already many of those countries have exerted strong political pressure to insure that countries like Japan and the United States build many of their products in the markets where they are sold -- which explains Malaysia's giant Mitsubishi car factory and the huge McDonnell Douglas aircraft assembly plant in Shanghai.
"If there was this much debate on Nafta, imagine the debate you would have in America over a free trade area with the whole Pacific," said Han Sung Joo, South Korea's Foreign Minister.
The United States is clearly also isolated within the group on another major tenet of American foreign policy -- human rights. So far, few of the other member economies have joined in American protests over the treatment of dissidents in China and Indonesia, the Pacific's two most populous countries.
State Department officials have made it clear that Mr. Clinton will be raising human rights concerns here when he meets on Friday with Jiang Zimen, China's President, in the first such meeting since the Beijing Government suppressed China's pro-democracy movement in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: The Partners' Reaction;
Mexican Leader a Big Winner As the Trade Pact Advances

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Arduously as it may have come, many Mexicans today hailed the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement as resounding confirmation of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's vision of a new economic future for their country.
"It's an enormous personal and political victory," the novelist Carlos Fuentes said of Wednesday night's vote. "Salinas has really clinched his whole economic revolution. Mexico's economic position in the world is assured." 
 Far more than Bill Clinton, it was Mr. Salinas who staked his Presidency on the trade agreement, often dragging a reluctant nation into partnership with a powerful neighbor it has always feared. And even more than Mr. Clinton, Mr. Salinas and his long-ruling party may reap decisive benefits.
 
There Is a Downside
 Yet while the approval of the agreement may mark the beginning of Mexico's emergence from the third world and its unchallenged leadership of Latin America in that process, the path is by no means clear.
Though the Mexican economy has been in the throes of profound change since the country began opening its borders to foreign competition in 1986, economists predict that several million Mexicans will probably lose their jobs in the first five years after the accord takes effect on Jan. 1.
How the Government will ease the impact while new jobs are created, what role it will take in guiding industrial integration with the United States and Canada and how it will respond to rising pressure for further democratization of an authoritarian political system are all questions that Mexican officials have yet to answer fully.
"Mexico must now prepare for a very difficult period," said Berta Lujan, a trade-union organizer who was a leader of the modest political opposition to the agreement. "There are going to be social costs to the economic restructuring, and I think that Mexico may not be prepared for either the restructuring or for the costs it will have to pay."
Lorenzo Zambrano, chief executive of the huge cement manufacturer Cementos Mexicanos and a strong supporter of the agreement, said the Government had oversold its benefits.
"It will not by itself make us into an Asian tiger," he said in a telephone interview from his office in Monterrey. But he added, "This makes it extraordinarily difficult for Mexico to ever turn back to the old closed economy, and it makes our comparative advantage of being the neighbor of the United States much more tangible."
 
A Subdued Leader
 As though sobered by the agreement's near-defeat, Mr. Salinas marked his triumph with striking restraint. And his office insisted again that he has no plans to go to Seattle for the meeting of leaders from Pacific Rim countries, despite rumors that he would.
While senior Salinas aides beamed and laughed and slapped one another on the back, their 45-year-old leader appeared almost poker-faced when he emerged from his offices about an hour after the vote.
"I reiterate that we should not expect immediate effects from the treaty," he said. "The principal effects of the treaty will be reflected in the medium term and because of that, overly high expectations would not be justified."
By its intense promotion of the deal both at home and abroad, the Salinas Government had helped to create a situation in which potential losses from a rejection of the accord would have been worse than anything Mexico might have suffered had Mr. Salinas never taken up the offer of a trade pact.
Though the Government was attacked by opponents of the agreement for having spent millions of dollars to lobby for it in the United States, many Mexican officials expressed a sense of powerlessness as the vote neared.
Key aides to Mr. Salinas who had expected to join the fight in Washington were told by United States officials to stay home because it was thought that their presence might be counterproductive. And before Mr. Clinton telephoned on Wednesday night to offer congratulations, Mr. Salinas had gone more than a month without hearing from him, two Mexican officials said.
Mexican officials also seem to have been somewhat chastened by the high price they were forced to pay to win Congressional support.
 
The Shadow of Deal-Making
 On Wednesday night the Trade Secretary, Jaime Serra Puche, continued to insist that Mexico had not renegotiated any aspect of the agreement in response to the demands of United States legislators. But as the vote neared, complaints rose from Mexican business executives who saw some Nafta benefits for exporters of sugar, citrus fruits, vegetables and other items dealt away.
Even so, the vote in Washington will bring an immediate and perhaps insurmountable boost to Mr. Salinas and the Institutional Revolutionary Party as Mexicans turn their attention to the election of his successor in August.
Under the Constitution, Mr. Salinas cannot run for re-election. But with neither the leftist nor rightist opposition yet able to rise above about 20 percent support, the President's coattails now seem long enough to carry forward whichever aide he chooses as the party's candidate. The President is to announce his candidate by January.
 
'It Was a Great Risk'
 "In many years there has been nothing so important for the country as this treaty," said Antonio Aguilar Gomez, 73, a retired hospital worker, as he sat this morning on a bench in the Alameda park in downtown Mexico City. "Salinas has shown great audacity. There were a lot of doubts about the treaty. It was a great risk, but he had a vision that others did not have."
For millions of Mexicans, especially poorer people who have yet to see gain from the economic changes that Mr. Salinas has carried out, the trade accord looms as a shining if vague promise of better jobs, higher wages and more of everything American, from breakfast cereals to banks.
In a neighborhood bar in Mexico City, a 31-year-old electrician, Geraldo Diaz, thought for a moment when asked late Wednesday night about the effects of the agreement, then said, "I think my salary is going to go up about 20 percent, more or less."
He could not explain exactly why that would happen, Mr. Diaz said; he just had a feeling.

Canadian Threat Fades
 TORONTO, Nov. 18 (Special to The New York Times) -- Canadian officials said today that a threat to delay the North American Free Trade Agreement would probably be withdrawn if the United States and Mexico resolved to negotiate codes covering unfair trade.
Part of Canada's unfinished business with the pact is an insistence on greater security against what Ottawa feels are often arbitrary curbs on exports on the ground of unfair pricing.
But because of the time needed to work out new standards in one of the most complex sectors of trade policy, officials here say it is unlikely the trade accord will be delayed.
The newly elected Prime Minister, Jean Chretien of the Liberal Party, said today that he remains convinced of the need for special adjustments covering some trade sectors, specifically a definition of unfair subsidies and the "dumping" of exports at unfairly low prices.
Both President Clinton and Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, have said they want to try to accommodate Canada's concerns.
Roy MacLaren, Minister of International Trade, said he did not see a need for Canada to delay implementation of the North American accord.
"I don't know if we need to approach it in that way," he said in Seattle. "I am quite confident we will be able to reach agreement in the near future on how we might best proceed."
The business community has declared its own firm resistance to any delay in carrying out the accord.

HEADLINE: FRANCE NOW FACES U.S. ON TRADE ISSUE

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 18

 BODY:
The progress of the North American Free Trade Agreement has given an important spur to attempts to conclude a world trade agreement by Dec. 15, but it has also placed Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in a tight corner.
"Last night, President Clinton won half the battle," Peter Sutherland, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said today, summing up a widespread European feeling that if the accord had failed, global talks known as the Uruguay Round would have had scant chance of approval. "I'm not here to tell you that the Uruguay Round is now in the bag," he said. "It isn't. But it's almost within our grasp." 
 For more than two years, the United States and France have sparred over a GATT accord, divided by issues like agricultural trade and French insistence that the trade forum subsidize its movies and its aircraft. Now Mr. Balladur faces a newly self-confident Mr. Clinton, a 27-day deadline, a restive ally in Germany and a surly domestic constituency ready to pounce if he does not get palpable concessions from Washington.
 
Great Pressure on France
 The pressure on France has never been greater. Setting a buoyant American tone, Secretary of State Warren Christopher declared in Seattle: "This vote sends a message to Geneva on GATT that the United States remains fully committed to opening markets and doing so on the time schedule envisaged by Congress, Dec. 15. There'll be no Dec. 16. That's the message I want to go from here to Europe."
Mr. Christopher mentioned Geneva, where the trade forum has its headquarters, but the message was clearly aimed at Paris. European governments know that an agreement under GATT could be a decisive stimulus for stagnant European economies. But difficulties remain in France.
A combination of recession, soaring unemployment and national disorientation after the cold war have helped turn GATT into a dirty word in France. It has become equated in the popular imagination with jobs lost to cheap labor in places like Singapore, the devastation of the French countryside through lost agricultural exports, and marauding American culture.
Politicians of all stripes, including President Francois Mitterrand, the Gaullist leader Jacques Chirac and Mr. Balladur, have insisted they will not yield on trade issues that they consider essential.
These issues include adjusting the Blair House accord concluded last year between the United States and the European Community calling for a 21 percent cut over six years in the volume of subsidized European grain exports and food; insuring that the French movie industry retains the right to be subsidized and French television the right to limit American programming, and improving access for French services, particularly banking, in the United States.
On all these questions, up to now, the United States has shown little or no inclination to budge.
 
Up to U.S., French Say
 But French officials said today that with gains for the North American accord, Mr. Clinton should have more room for maneuver. "It's now up to Washington to come up with new propositions, which alone will enable the GATT negotiation to be successfully concluded," Industry Minister Gerard Longuet said.
A senior Foreign Ministry official said concessions by the United States would not have to be large because Mr. Balladur, a free trader by instinct, wants to reach an accord. "But," the official said, "Mr. Balladur has to have something to show a skeptical public or the risks to his Government are enormous."

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Labor;
Unions Vow to Punish Pact's Backers

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Leaders of the nation's labor unions today swore to get even with the representatives who voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, and they accused President Clinton of outright political bribery in his deals to win votes for the pact.
But amid the rancor, Mr. Clinton, on his way to Seattle for a Pacific Rim meeting, tried to mend fences, calling Lane Kirkland, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., from Air Force One. 
 No fight, not even its nastiest squabbles in the Reagan-Bush years, has so ignited labor, and no defeat has so stunned it. To stop the agreement, labor mobilized more money, troops and lobbying muscle than on any issue since the 1930's.
For the first time in more than a decade, it built a real political force, one irksome enough for the President to rebuke labor for using "roughshod" and "muscle-bound' tactics against the trade agreement's supporters.
 
Wide-Ranging Alliances
 With their own power base having dwindled with the decline of union membership to less than 16 percent of the work force, unions struck alliances against the trade agreement with Ross Perot, Jesse Jackson, Ralph Nader and the Sierra Club. Frightened for their jobs, rank-and-file members, often indifferent to their leaders' causes, and nonunion workers helped drive the campaign.
"We found our voice in this fight, as did the American public," said Jack Sheinkman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union.
Still, the unions lost. They tried to show a Democratic President that he could not rule without them, and the President called their bluff.
"They threw all their forces into this and made it a defining issue of labor's strength," Ted Van Dyk, a Democratic political consultant, said. "They got themselves painted as rear-guard oppositionists to modernism. They got themselves trapped as negativists."
Today, Mr. Kirkland called a news conference with 11 bristling union presidents flanking him. President Clinton had "stiffed" working people and bribed Congress for votes, Mr. Kirkland said.
 
'Rights of Workers'
 "Amid all the planes, trains and bridges and all the protections for citrus, peanuts, sugar and wheat," Mr. Kirkland said, "there was not one word about the rights of workers on both sides of the border to obtain decent wages and safe working conditions or to defend themselves from gross exploitation."
Several of the union presidents promised retribution against the legislators who supported the agreement.
"We will not forget those Congressmen," said William H. Bywater of the electronics workers union. "And I guarantee in November my union and many other unions that feel as I do, we're going to make sure we get even at the polls." He said later that he, the teamsters union, the operating engineers and other unions would meet to set a strategy for the elections.
 
Labor's Decision
 But most of the votes for the trade pact were cast by Republicans, who rarely count on labor support. And many of the 102 Democrats who voted for it represent rural and Southern districts where unions barely exist. Many other Democrats backing the pact support unions on other issues, so would labor dump them, too?
"Why in the world would labor go after those Democrats whom they need for upcoming votes?" said Robert D. Squier, a political adviser to Democratic candidates. For all the anger they feel now, Mr. Squier said, "there's not a suicidal bone in their body."
President Clinton's spokesman, Mark D. Gearan, said the White House was surprised by the intensity of labor leaders' comments, and a senior Administration official said that "he's already begun making calls" to union officers.
 
A 'Warm Visit'
 Mr. Clinton, on his way to a meeting of the forum on Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, called Mr. Kirkland, pool reporters said, quoting officials accompanying him. Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the President's chief of staff, said the two had a "warm visit." Officials said the President invited Mr. Kirkland to meet with him, probably in early December.
The Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research organization, found that 78 percent of the House Democrats who voted against the trade pact had received more campaign funds from unions than from business.
How much the vote will alter the politics driving the remainder of the unions' and the President's legislative goals is impossible to discern. Both want to overhaul health care, and the President cannot expect to marshal as many Republican votes for his plan -- 132 -- as he did for the trade agreement.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Ticketmaster Near Deal With Potential Partner

BYLINE: By JOSHUA MILLS

 BODY:
The Ticketmaster Corporation, the upstart whose computers dominate the sales of sports and concert tickets, is likely to acquire a major partner shortly: Paul G. Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft who is now a major shareholder in America Online, the computer-based information service.
Ticketmaster sells more than 52 million tickets a year and has annual sales of more than $1.3 billion. The company, based in Los Angeles, is owned largely by the Pritzker family of Chicago, which owns the Hyatt hotel chain. 
 "We may have taken it as far as we can," Jay Pritzker said yesterday in a telephone interview, adding that the likelihood was that his family would add a partner rather than selling outright. There are people outside the family, he said, "who could bring more to the party, with interactivity coming in."
 
Action Expected Soon
 Spokesmen at some of Mr. Allen's companies did not return telephone calls or said he would not comment. But people familiar with the negotiations say the investment is likely to be about $275 million and the deal should be announced before the end of the year, perhaps within days.
What Mr. Allen, who retired a billionaire from Microsoft in 1983 at age 31, has in mind, people in the industry say, is probably some sort of link between Ticketmaster's computerized ticketing and the tens of millions of personal computers that can tap into it through America Online or a similar service.
Last month Ticketmaster, America Online and the Tribune Company, which owns the Chicago Cubs, announced a project that might serve as a model for a national, or even international, system: personal computer owners can link to the system by telephone modems, scan concert and sports schedules, buy tickets to events and order Cubs' merchandise. Mr. Allen, who earlier this year bought a 24.9 percent stake in America Online, already has ties to professional sports; he bought the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team in 1988.
 
Rise to Dominance
 Ticketmaster was founded in the early 1980's in Scottsdale, Ariz., when the computerized ticket business was dominated by Ticketron, which started in 1968.
After Fredric D. Rosen, a New York lawyer, became the chairman of Ticketmaster, it moved to Los Angeles and cashed in on the rock-concert business, which was increasingly dominated by the California-based record companies.
By 1985, Ticketmaster was profitable, while Ticketron, owned by the Control Data Corporation, languished. Ticket managers and concert promoters said Ticketron provided poor serviceand, in contrast to Ticketmaster, did not get involved in marketing the events for which it sold tickets.
The Carlyle Group bought Ticketron in 1989 for $19 million, but the service lost money steadily and was sold to Ticketmaster in 1991 for an undisclosed price.
Today, Ticketmaster has "a tremendous network, many outlets, huge phone rooms," said Joel Fisher, vice president for business and consumer sales at Madison Square Garden, which has done business with Ticketmaster since 1988.
 
An Exclusive Deal
 Ticketmaster's contract with Madison Square Garden is typical of its arrangements with coliseums and arenas. "We made them exclusive seller for all events at the Garden and the Paramount," a theater within the building, Mr. Fisher said. While much of Ticketmaster's business is done over the phone, most box offices including Madison Square Garden's are hooked into Ticketmaster's computers as well.
Ticketmaster pays face value for the tickets, Mr. Fisher said, and makes its money through handling and service fees, a percentage of which are returned to Madison Square Garden. Typically, he said, Ticketmaster handles about 20 percent of the more than three million tickets the Garden sells annually.
The fees can be hefty. Karen Sachs, a spokeswoman for the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, said a 1992 survey of events handled by Ticketmaster found that fees added an average of 29 percent to ticket prices, based on a phone order for two tickets.
The fees -- from $2.75 to $7.10 a ticket and an additional $1.50 to $2.55 an order -- are not regulated. Rather, Ticketmaster negotiates its fees with the source of the tickets.
"We don't want the service charge to be huge over the face value of our tickets," said Mr. Fisher of Madison Square Garden.
Ticketmaster also makes money by marketing merchandise as ticket orders are phoned in.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: How Clinton Won;
56 Long Days of Coordinated Persuasion

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
In the last eight weeks, Representative Anna G. Eshoo, a first-term Democrat from California, has been to the White House three times, dined at the Vice President's residence once and held dozens of conversations with members of the Cabinet. As she was leaving for Mexico on a fact-finding mission, President Clinton tracked her down by phone.
Representative Eshoo was on the receiving end of the White House strategy that amounted to a coordinated, computer-generated, all-hands-on-deck plan to pry votes loose for the North American Free Trade Agreement that consumed nearly all of the time of the President and his lieutenants for 56 critical days. 
 If Ms. Eshoo worried aloud about the environmental side effects of the trade pact, Carol M. Browner, the Administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, or Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt would be dispatched to soothe her fears. If she doubted its economic impact, she would find Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen knocking on the door of her Longworth House Office Building suite.
And when the Administration wanted to close the deal, Mr. Clinton invited her to the Oval Office for a final private round of reassurance.
Representative Eshoo, who said she treated the members of the Cabinet like county department heads in her home district, said she saw nothing unusual in the attention she received and used her high-powered visitors to provide answers to questions she received from constituents in her Silicon Valley district south of San Francisco.
"For me this was not a Washington decision," she said.
 
Elements of Grand Plan
 But at the White House, the last two months have been all about how to win in Washington. Starting out far behind and lacking traditional party support, the Clinton White House won the free trade battle by alienating friends, embracing enemies and working members of Congress with all of the attention and care typically found in a small-town sheriff's race. At stake, White House officials said, was the stature of the President and his ability to win future battles.
For the Administration, every phone call, visit and hometown newspaper editorial was an element of a grand plan. And as the full magnitude of the victory began to make itself clear during the 48 hours leading up to Wednesday night's vote, the Administration officials who worked out a plan to first freeze lawmakers in their tracks and then woo them over to the President's side with sweet reason and sweet deals, exulted in their success.
"It was pretty at the end, but it wasn't very pretty along the way," Stanley Greenberg, the President's pollster, said today.
The path to victory was strewn, in fact, with elements of the lessons learned from the President's other legislative near-death experiences. The intensity came from the budget struggles; the focus came from the fallout over the gays-in-the-military policy and the politics of the head count came from the determination not to hang another supporter out to dry like the White House did when it forced Representative Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinksy, a Pennsylvania Democrat with a precarious hold on her job, to cast the decisive vote for the higher taxes in the budget bill.
The biggest problem all along was what the members of Mr. Clinton's own party would do with the trade accord, which was despised by many traditional Democrats, including union members. Many Democrats had also staked out their opposition last year when President George Bush first presented it. In looking-glass fashion, they knew they would have to rely on Republicans instead of Democrats for the bulk of any victory.
"Most members wanted cover," one White House official said. "They wanted to get labor off their backs. They wanted to get Perot off their backs. They wanted to make it politically possible to support it."
 
President Absent at Start
 But by Labor Day, the President was nowhere to be seen on the issue, and supporters of the accord began to worry when the White House made clear that the President intended to spend as much time as possible on his health care plan rather than on the trade agreement.
"In spring and summer, some of the members thought they could have a free ride on this; an easy no," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who helped lead the House fight. "There was no countervailing force."
Without the President's personal commitment to the issue, they feared, they would all suffer defeat. These complaints leaked steadily and anonymously into news reports about the trade agreement, and finally snagged the attention of the President and his chief advisers.
Then White House officials were able to corral three former Presidents who came to Washington for the signing of the peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to speak in favor of the trade agreement at a formal event in the East Room of the White House.
At the "East Room event," as it is now referred to in reverential terms in the Administration, Mr. Clinton delivered his first wholehearted speech on the agreement with enough verve to send sighs of relief through the ranks of business people and politicians who had seen their cause slipping away.
That was Sept. 22, and the hunt for votes began in earnest. "Our goal from the very beginning was just to hold people," said William Daley, the Chicago businessman who was recruited to run the White House effort on the accord. "Because if they were moving in September and October, they were pretty much moving against us."
The day after the President's speech, House supporters could count only 100 of the Democrats they needed in their column. Sixty-two said they were against it and 152 were undecided.
 
Vote-Chasing Marathon
 The President began an effort that came to include 18 public events, meetings with more than 150 wavering House members in October, selectively timed endorsements, telephoning marathons and the creation of an extensive lobbying system in which names of undecided House members were divided up among Cabinet members and senior officials for persuasion and head-counting.
And during the last week, the White House took to the airwaves to deliver what one official called a "one-two punch" and another called a "circuit breaker." Mr. Clinton chastised labor unions for playing hardball on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" and Mr. Gore bested Ross Perot on CNN's "Larry King Live."
"The dam broke after the debate," Mr. Matsui said.
Part of the reason the atmosphere changed, officials said, was because they had succeeded in changing the terms of the discussion about trade.
Instead of arguing back and forth over job losses and gains, Mr. Gore and Mr. Clinton were able to defuse the opposition and define the battle as one about the international stature of the United States.
"Back in their districts, members went home and suddenly their mail was turning even," said David R. Gergen, the counselor to the President. "It changed the politics of it. It made them more open to Presidential persuasion."
Susan Brophy, the legislative liaison, dreamed up the plan to use Cabinet members as a substitute for the organization that Representative David E. Bonior, a Democratic House leader, took with him when he announced he would oppose the agreement and do all he could to defeat it.
 
'Code Blue' Got Results
 When a likely supporter began to slip away, anyone who caught the first whiff of defection notified the White House and officials there issued what they called a "code blue," a signal that immediate attention was needed. In the beginning, the White House goal was just to stop lawmakers from making up their minds too soon.
Then there was the muscle. The bulk of the strategy came from the seasoned political operatives on the White House staff, Rahm Emanuel, a Chicago native who raised money during the Presidential campaign and once ran the White House political operation, and Mr. Daley, a banker, the son and brother of two Chicago mayors, and Ms. Brophy.
By the time the final debate began on the House floor on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Emanuel was too nervous to sit still. At one point, his phone rang and Ms. Brophy was on the other end, telling him that Representative Charlie Rose, a North Carolina Democrat who had said he was opposed to the agreement, was changing his mind. Mr. Emanuel whooped.
"When we take one from a 'no' to a 'yes' without stopping at 'undecided,' we call it a three-pointer from the top of the key," he exulted, using the terminology of a man caught up in the last quarter of a basketball game.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Texas;
San Antonio Celebrates New Free Trade World

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN ANTONIO, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Welcome to the new crossroads of North America. Perhaps that is an embellishment of the situation here, one day after the House approved a continental free trade pact that many economists agree would benefit San Antonio more than any other major American city and Texas more than any other state.
But that was the exuberant boast from city officials, who threw a huge festival downtown this afternoon to celebrate the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, complete with mariachi bands and ritual shattering of cascarones, Mexican confetti-filled eggs. 
 Nor is it all that much of a stretch to say that at least for now, all roads to Mexico lead through San Antonio, the closest big American city to Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara. About half of the Mexican imports and nearly 70 percent of the United States exports to Mexico pass through San Antonio by train or truck.
 
'We Are Ecstatic'
 If the current $80 billion in trade between the countries doubles by the turn of the century, as one state study projects, many people here have a definite idea about who stands to get a generous piece of an enlarged pie.
"We are ecstatic," said Al Martinez-Fonts, president of the Texas Commerce Bank in San Antonio and chairman of the local Chamber of Commerce. "We're at the center of the action."
Some members of a city delegation that went to Washington to lobby for the pact stayed there, hoping to press San Antonio's case as the site for a new North American Development Bank to be created under the pact.
Elsewhere in Texas, in communities along the state's 1,200-mile Rio Grande River border with Mexico and in big cities like Houston and Dallas, there was considerable enthusiasm as well.
"We are going to be transformed," said Pat Ahumada, the Mayor of Brownsville, a border city near the Gulf of Mexico that is one of the poorest cities in the United States.
Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas, stepping off a plane on Wednesday night in Houston after a pro-trade-pact lobbying trip to Washington, said the Congressional vote "places Texas at the center of the world's largest trading zone" and would bring tens of thousands of jobs to the state.
 
'A Natural Advantage'
 And also in Houston, Mayor Bob Lanier predicted that passage of the trade agreement would provide a significant benefit for Texas's largest city. "Right now the oil business is flat, NASA is flat, the health business is reasonably flat," he said. "Foreign trade is an area where we have a chance to grow. We have a natural advantage due to proximity, our Hispanic population and our port."
Texas exports to Mexico amounted to $18.9 billion last year, according to the United States Commerce Department, three times the amount of the exports of California, the state with the second-highest volume of trade.
Here in San Antonio, the local Economic Development Foundation, which seeks to lure businesses to the area, wasted no time today in getting on the telephone to executives at 85 companies that are seriously considering putting operations in San Antonio. Many of them had said they would wait to see how the vote would come out before making decisions.
Still, Peggy McCray, a principal officer of McCray Research, a consulting concern based here that monitors trade with Mexico, warned that despite its fortunate geographic position, San Antonio's role as a free trade hub could ultimately be overtaken by larger cities like Houston or Dallas.
With a population of about one million, more than half of Hispanic descent, San Antonio is the country's 10th-largest city, but is still dwarfed by the other two Texas cities.


GRAPHIC: The Senate is tentatively scheduled to vote on the North American Freee Trade Agreement on Saturday. If the bill passes, it will be phased in according to this timetable. All dates are Jan. 1.
 
1994 -- The United States immediately cancels tariffs on 60 percent of Mexican goods now subject to import taxes; other tariffs are phased out over 5 to 15 years.
 
1998 -- United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which took effect on Jan. 1, 1989, and which the Nafta expands on, eliminates the reamining tariffs on each country's goods.
 
2000 -- American banks, virtually banned from Mexico now, will be allowed to have taken over 15 percent of the Mexican market by this date. In addition, American trucking companies will be allowed to begin taking majority stakes in Mexican trucking concerns, and truck drivers from both nations will be allowed to haul goods across the border and deliver them anywhere in either country.
 
2003 -- More American tariffs will be eliminated on Mexican goods, bringing to 92 percent the proportion of previously taxed Mexican goods entering the United States duty free.
 
2008 -- Remaining tariffs are eliminated on a handful of goods traded between Mexico and the United States as well as Canada. These goods include the cantaloupes and glassware imported by the United States and corn imported by Mexico.

HEADLINE: THE FREE TRADE ACCORD: Auto Workers;
Anger, Fear but Also Hope on the Assembly Line

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FLINT, Mich., Nov. 18

 BODY:
As the first shift poured out of the mammoth Buick assembly plant here this afternoon, Bill Ferguson, an Igloo cooler and newspaper in hand, gave his version of the resignation that many auto workers felt about the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
"That sucking sound was there before Nafta," said the 53-year-year-old Mr. Ferguson, alluding to Ross Perot's prediction during last year's Presidential campaign. "I think our jobs -- they're gone." 
 With the pact making it even easier for companies to move their plants, he said, the agreement was also sure to strengthen management's hand in bargaining with his union, the United Automobile Workers. "It's just another chip to use to hold over our heads," he said.
 
Feeling Let Down
 Workers interviewed in this frayed factory town dominated by several huge General Motors plants said they remained suspicious of the trade agreement and its well-heeled corporate sponsors. Even if it did not hurt, they said, the pact would not help preserve jobs like theirs, which pay about $17 per hour with full benefits. And with President Clinton's complaints about big labor's tactics and his own expensive last-minute arm-twisting, they said, he badly let them down.
But many workers also said that with the agreement apparently headed for ratification in the Senate they hoped it would bring some of the benefits that its backers claimed.
"I voted for President Clinton, but I didn't vote for him to do this," said Ed Millington, who has spent 28 of his 46 years in the plants. Still, "I'm a fair person. I'll see how this works."
 
Some Benefits
 Indeed, some said they were optimistic about the agreement's possibilities for the United States, if not for auto workers. "I think it'll be good for the nation," said Ples McDuffie, polishing off a double cheeseburger in Angelo's restaurant and before going back to making steel slugs for spark plugs.
A bigger trade bloc will make the United States more competitive globally, said Mr. McDuffie, and will also break down suspicions among nations. "You look at Europe and everyone else -- seems like everyone is going with that structure," he said.
But what benefits the country as a whole may not benefit auto-parts workers like himself, said Mr. McDuffie, who was working a 2 A.M.-to-2 P.M. shift to fill in for colleagues who vanished with the start of deer-hunting season. Mr. McDuffie fears that he and his co-workers could lose their jobs. "I'm against it," he said of the pact. "I don't like seeing our jobs shipped out."
In some cases, workers' resignation about the accord seemed to be a product of despair. "I don't know," said Jim Gardella, when asked if jobs would vanish to Mexico. "Are there any left?" Given the drubbing the local economy has taken, he said, he hoped that in the long run the the pact would help promote growth. "I'll wait and see," said Mr. Gardella, who has worked in G.M.'s Buick City complex here for 31 years. In that time, he said, he has seen the work force at the complex shrink from 28,000 to 11,000.
 
A North American Union
 Dave Yettaw, the president of Local 599 here and the leader of a small dissident U.A.W. faction favoring a more aggressive stance toward management, said American labor unions should reach out aggressively to Mexican workers. "We need to have a labor union of North America," capable of calling general strikes, he said. "In the European economic community, that's what they do."
But like many of his union colleagues, Mr. Yettaw said that the first thing that labor needed was a more credible and effective spokesman. "It's a sad state of affairs when Ross Perot stands as the spokesman for organized labor and working people," he said.
Workers who took a longer view of the union's struggles and the American economy said the agreement would not matter much. "I don't think it's a good deal," said Al Federico, 85, a retiree who helped organize the Flint plants in the 1930's, when American auto workers were paid less than what the pact's opponents say Mexican ones are paid now. "But America is too strong, and it will survive this."

HEADLINE: Bright Sun of Trade Rising in the East

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 18

 BODY:
A prominent European ambassador was at the White House recently for a talk with members of President Clinton's national security team and to raise an unusual protest: the Administration, the ambassador complained, was spending too much time focused on Asia and the Pacific and not enough on Europe.
Officials say the ambassador was told politely that with Asia's emergence in world trade and with North Korea now the most dangerous threat to global stability, Washington was going to focus more of its post-cold-war foreign policy on Asia and the Pacific. 
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher recently declared that "Western Europe is no longer the dominant area of the world" and that Washington has to get over its Eurocentric view of diplomacy. President Clinton's arrival in Seattle today for a summit meeting of the 15-nation forum on Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation is the latest expression of this shift.
 
Consider the Numbers
 Administration officials have said the meeting here serves notice that "in both economic and security terms, Asia has been put on a front burner," in the words of Mr. Clinton's trade representative, Mickey Kantor.
Underpinning this shift are economic, security and generational changes.
The 14 other members of the forum account for 40 percent of all United States trade; the 12 nations in the European Community account for about 35 percent. The United States has an $80 billion trade deficit with the other members of the forum, while it has a surplus with Latin America and is roughly in balance with Europe.
The United States exports $128 billion in goods and services annually to the 14 other forum members, supporting about 5.3 million American jobs, compared with about $102 billion to Europe.
 
Clinton's 'No. 1 Priority'
 "President Clinton has made reviving the domestic economy his No. 1 priority," said Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Affairs. "Asia and the Pacific are now the most lucrative terrain for American exports and American jobs, and therefore the most relevant region of the world for the President's domestic economic agenda."
James Auer, an Asia expert at Vanderbilt University, said the shift to a foreign policy better balanced between Asia and Europe began under President Ronald Reagan, who was primarily interested in containing Soviet influence in the Pacific.
But, he said, "that trend was halted under the Bush Administration, when there was backsliding toward Eurocentrism" as the Berlin wall came down. Mr. Bush's Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, spent less than a week in Beijing and Tokyo in four years.
This week, Mr. Clinton will deliver his fourth major speech on Asian policy. He will not deliver his first address on Europe until January, at a NATO summit meeting.
But with the Communist threat having receded, Mr. Clinton is drawn to Asia by a very different notion of national security: promoting free trade and stemming missile proliferation.
 
The Domestic Constituency
 "The Bush generation grew up in the tradition of the Atlantic Community," said Lee Hong Koo, a former South Korean Ambassador to Britain and cabinet minister, "whereas Clinton seems free of the traditions that make it automatic to focus on Europe. I am sure he is not trying to replace Europe, but we believe he wants a more balanced view and feels free to do so."
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said another reason the United States had tended toward Eurocentrism "was because most immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries came from there."
But in recent decades, there "has been a reorientation of the country away from our European roots," he added. "Our future," Mr. Reich said, "seems to lie more with Latin America and Asia, where more and more of our population is coming from."
Couple these population shifts with the fact that the end of the cold war "has presented an opportunity to rethink some very basic questions about how America should relate to the rest of the world," Mr. Reich said, and the new emphasis is "quite logical."
 
Fear of an 800-Pound Gorilla
 Asian leaders are ambivalent about this new focus: they want the United States to act as a balance between China and Japan but they are sensitive about being dominated by Washington or drawn into security or trading blocs that might harm their commercial relations elsewhere or among themselves.
This makes American leadership in Asia a much more subtle enterprise than with NATO in Europe.
"There is no legacy of communal fellowship in Asia-Pacific," said Mr. Lee, the former Korean envoy. "It is not like the European Community, where you faced a common enemy together. It is much more of a Wild West situation where you have to persuade each country to come along on each issue."
For some, the intensified United States interest in Asia is also a lever they can use against Washington.
"The Chinese, in particular, understand now that the United States needs their market," said Robert D. Hormats, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.
"Fifteen years ago our entire relationship with China was geo-strategic," he said. "They were a card to play against the Soviets. Now it is geo-economic. They know we need them as a market for exports, not a card to play. That gives them a lot more leverage when we make demands on them about human rights. Clinton will be meeting with a much more self-confident Chinese leadership than any President in the past."

HEADLINE: Japanese Premier Wins Approval of Vote Reform

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 18

 BODY:
Parliament passed landmark electoral reform legislation today, handing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa his first important victory and pushing the old party system toward a realignment.
The surprisingly strong 270-to-226 margin of victory in the powerful lower house broke a long deadlock on cleaning up Japan's scandal-tainted politics. The outcome also underscored how much the leadership of the world's second largest economy is in the embrace of a whirlwind transition after five years of corruption scandals. 
 Though beaming after the vote as he shook hands with members of his disparate coalition of conservatives and Socialists, Mr. Hosokawa sought to strike a cautious note. The legislative package of four bills still faces a vote in the upper house of Parliament, where the coalition has a solid majority.
"We have a saying that you must not believe you have walked halfway on a 100-mile journey until you reach the 99th mile," he said. "In that respect, we have covered only one-third of the road we have to walk."
Nonetheless, the idea of such legislation's passing -- and with nearly 20 lawmakers crossing party lines -- would have been unthinkable just six months ago. But because the political world has been so thoroughly shaken by the growing list of indicted politicians and rising public anger, the main questions were how much the new parties that assumed power three months ago would be strengthened and how damaged the once dominant Liberal Democratic Party would be.
Indeed, with 13 Liberal Democrats openly defying their leadership and voting in favor of the bills, while 4 abstained, the party that ran the Government for 38 years appeared to be heading toward its second serious split this year.
Several political analysts agreed that even when these bills become law, it is far from certain that the string of bribery scandals will end, so systemic is the graft.
In addition, getting through the struggle for cleaner politics just permits Mr. Hosokawa to focus on other difficult tasks, like stimulating the stalled economy, removing some of the layers of regulations that restrict commerce, reorienting the government bureaucracy toward serving consumers rather than manufacturers and reducing the soaring trade surplus.
Even with that heavy agenda, when Mr. Hosokawa flies to Seattle Friday for a meeting with President Clinton and the heads of government from other Pacific countries, he will be more firmly in control of policymaking than any other Japanese prime minister in years. Because he was seen as serious in his commitment to reform, he received the highest approval ratings of any prime minister in the postwar era -- more than 70 percent -- even before today's vote.
The legislation passed today will completely change the way members of the powerful lower house of Parliament are elected, redraw the election districts, reapportion seats by taking some away from rural districts and giving them to cities, and change the way campaigns are financed.
Corporations will be permitted to make contributions only to parties, not individuals, and the parties will receive public subsidies.
One goal of the legislation is to remove an incentive for graft by transforming the election districts from multi-seat to single-seat.
Under the current system, members of the same party often run against one another. They usually follow the party line on the issues and so do not compete on policies. Instead, the usually seek support through handing out "gifts" of money or by other types of lavish spending, which means they have voracious appetites for cash.
It is hoped that under the single-seat formula politicians will seek to distinguish themselves in terms of policies, a step that would mark radical change for Japan. It is also hoped that the new electoral formula -- under which the lower house will be reduced to 500 seats from 511 -- will in effect create a two-party system. The lower house will consist of 274 members from the new districts and 226 elected on the basis of proportional representation along party lines.

HEADLINE: Where the Mexico Gold Rush Begins

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAREDO, Tex., Nov. 18

 BODY:
From the red-tiled roofs of this fabled American gateway to Mexico to the executive suite of the nation's largest corporations, business began its race today to take advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Some companies here plan to parlay their proximity into expanded markets, while those more distant were talking as if the border had just shifted 1,000 miles or so northward.
Banks, insurers and brokerages will be among the first to exploit new opportunities under the trade agreement, but so will manufacturers like the General Motors Corporation. While many tariff reductions will be phased in over several years, Mexico's virtual ban on foreign financial institutions will be eased on Jan. 1. 
 The American International Group, a diversified insurance company, has been limited to holding a small stake in a modest insurance venture in Mexico. Now it plans to buy a controlling interest, send in marketers and build from there.
It's the sort of virgin market that makes Ned Cloonan, the company's director of international and corporate affairs, swoon. "The average Mexican is consuming about $30 of insurance a year," he said. "In the U.S., about $1,900 a year. About 80 percent of the Mexican population is under 40. They need insurance, and with our global expertise . . ."
Among securities firms, Merrill Lynch & Company is gunning to be the first to open in Mexico after Jan. 1. The firm has six offices in other Latin American nations, but until now has not even been allowed to solicit Mexican corporate business from a hotel room.
Merrill Lynch executives were so anxious about the fate of the agreement that on Wednesday they dispatched employees to Washington armed with cellular phones to feed them news. Jerome P. Kenney, Merrill's chief corporate strategist in New York, woke up relieved. Then he began planning a Mexican debut that could include sales of American stocks and bonds to investors, and of American financial expertise to corporations. From Merrill, Mexican companies will hear about raising money in foreign markets, and American investors will hear about Mexican securities' advantages.
"Once that is set up," Mr. Kenney said, "then you would contemplate the degree to which we become a local firm," selling Mexican investments to Mexicans.
 In Laredo, meanwhile, power breakfasters at La Posada Hotel dealt in English and Spanish over their cellular phones. Although incomes remain far below the national average, they compared their rapidly growing town (population 140,000) with San Antonio, New York and Hong Kong.
"When people from San Antonio, Dallas and New York didn't want to spend three minutes speaking about Mexico, we did," said Gary Jacobs, president of Laredo National Bancshares. Told later that Citicorp, the world's largest issuer of credit cards, planned a plastic blizzard for the previously closed Mexican market, Mr. Jacobs shrugged, opened his wallet and whipped out a Visa card issued by Bancomer, a large Mexican bank.
He jumped up from his breakfast table to clap Jaime Loera, manager of a maquiladora plant across the border, on the shoulder in celebration of the House vote. Mr. Loera's plant, where Rheem Manufacturing produces water heaters for the United States, will now have greater latitude to sell its heaters in Mexico.
And Mr. Jacobs is set to finance such activities. "More business? Yes," Mr. Jacobs said. "Especially trade-related." Maquiladora plants, largely owned by American corporations, have to ship most of their goods back to the United States under current trade rules.
For more than a century, Laredo has been a railroad gateway to Mexico. Now, half of all freight shipments from the United States to Mexico chug across bridges that span the Rio Grande here. From his bank office, Mr. Jacobs pointed to a string of manufacturing plants on the south bank of the river, and to a string of warehouses on the north.
 With the trade accord's future in doubt, some plans were on hold here before the vote. Dennis Nixon, president of the International Bank of Commerce in Laredo, said he had grown more cautious about approving loans, "in case it didn't pass."
The sprawling Mall Del Norte here, drawing shoppers from Monterrey and even Mexico City, had planned to expand -- Nafta or no -- but some retailers fear the loss of business to American stores that will open in Mexico. Laredo has the nation's largest Wal-Mart store that doesn't sell groceries, but Mexico City's new Wal-Mart is larger.
Luis Lidsky, whose chain of 36 department stores spans the Texas border, now plans to close several. "With everybody going into Mexico, our business is going to shrink," he said, in an office above his El Mundo store in downtown Laredo. "Retailing on the border is in for a major, major transformation."
Mr. Lidsky doubts that Mexican shoppers will continue to believe that goods north of the border are better than the same goods back home. "That will certainly change," he said. "Because more and more of the products that we're buying here say 'Made in Mexico.' "
 The many American manufacturers that campaigned for the agreement remain eager to dramatize domestic, but not foreign, job gains. Gary Tapella, Rheem's chief executive, said he would serve the Mexican market as much from his plant in Montgomery, Ala., as from his Mexican factory.
General Motors has two Mexican assembly plants that already supply the Mexican market and 51 maquiladora plants. But Mexico has been virtually closed to cars not made there, and the two G.M. plants could not justify the expense of the tooling to make Cadillacs and Oldsmobiles.
As of today, General Motors planned to step up American production of these nameplates, as well as of the Oldsmobile Silhouette mini-van, through November and December. "We want to be ready to start shipping across the border on Jan. 1," said Mustafa Mohatarem, G.M.'s director of economics. "There's pent-up demand."
He was happy to point to the benefits for plants in North Tarrytown, N.Y., and Detroit, but not to provide figures on increased output or job gains. "That we can't talk about," he said, protecting his claim in the Mexican Klondike. "That has competitive significance."

HEADLINE: Salvagers Receive 90% of Treasure; Insurers, 10%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NORFOLK, Va., Nov. 18

 BODY:
Salvagers of a ship that sank in 1857 with three tons of gold aboard were awarded 90 percent of the treasure by a Federal judge today, with only 10 percent going to a group of insurance companies that claimed ownership.
Earlier estimates had put the value of the treasure at $1 billion, but the judge, Richard B. Kellam of Federal District Court, said it was worth far less. 
 The Columbus-America Discovery Group, an Ohio investment syndicate, has spent $30 million on the salvage effort so far and has recovered more than a ton of gold. But Judge Kellam said the recovered gold was worth only about $21 million.
The steamship Central America sank 136 years ago in a hurricane off the South Carolina coast. Of the paddlewheel steamer's 578 passengers, 153 survived.
Many of the passengers were California prospectors traveling to New York with gold to head off a banking crisis. Shortly after the vessel sank, the insurance companies paid off at least $1.2 million in claims for the lost gold.
In 1987, Columbus-America found the muddy wreck 8,000 feet under water. It has been using a remote-controlled robot to salvage the ship and has recovered a 62-pound gold brick and thousands of $20 Double Eagle gold pieces.
Columbus-America said the wreck was abandoned and claimed ownership. But the insurers of the voyage and their corporate heirs said they still owned the gold. The insurance companies in the case are the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company, based in New York City; the Insurance Company of North America, based in Philadelphia; Lloyd's of London, and five other British companies. The Superintendent of Insurance of New York represents eight defunct companies.
 
'Finders, Keepers' Rule
 In 1990, Judge Kellam awarded the entire treasure to Columbus-America under an ancient "finders, keepers" rule in maritime law. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, sent the case back to Judge Kellam to reconsider the insurance claims.
The judge, in his latest 80-page ruling, said he took into account the millions already spent by the salvage group.
He ordered both sides to come up with a sale plan and said the court would impose its own plan if no agreement was reached within 30 days.

HEADLINE: Call for a New Study Derails a Plan to Build Luxury Homes on Robins Island

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD, L.I., Nov. 18

 BODY:
A plan to let a developer buy Robins Island, a 445-acre uninhabited island in Peconic Bay, and build 22 luxury homes there has apparently collapsed, giving new hope to groups that want Suffolk County to buy the island and turn it into a nature preserve.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo has already offered to finance half the cost of a county purchase, but County Executive Robert J. Gaffney has insisted that the state finance the entire deal. 
 The plan for private development was on the verge of approval but began to unravel on Wednesday when the Suffolk County Council on Environmental Review, an advisory panel to the County Legislature, ruled that an environmental study was required before the purchase could proceed.
The study could take up to two years and would make it impossible to meet a February deadline to complete the deal. The deadline was agreed to by the county; the seller, the Southold Development Corporation; and the developer, the Robis Corporation.
 
Impossible Deadline
 While the Legislature could overrule the council, a lawyer for Southold Development said the council's decision made it unlikely that the plan would survive.
"I don't see how the settlement can be concluded within the necessary period, and extending it is not a possibility," said the lawyer, Albert A. D'Agostino. "Even if the County Legislature doesn't go along with the council, there will be legal objections."
In 1989, the county agreed to buy the island for $9.2 million. But soon after, Southold Development filed for bankruptcy and sought court approval to sell instead to Robis for $12.2 million.
Mr. Gaffney and a majority of the 18-member Legislature had backed the plan for the county to abandon efforts to buy the island and allow Robis to buy it instead.
Robis would then have sought permission from the Town of Southold, where Robins Island is, to build the 22 homes on five-acre lots near the shoreline of the wooded isle. With its spectacular views and splendid isolation, the island has been promoted as the jewel of the Peconic. Proponents of the county purchase have called it Long Island's Yosemite.
 
A Change in Policy
 Under the plan, about 90 percent of the island would have been placed under a conservation easement to guard it from development.
But the environmental council said the proposal represented a change in policy and would thus trigger a requirement in the State Environmental Quality Review Act for a detailed study.
Paul Sabatino, the counsel to the County Legislature, said a vote on the plan would probably occur at a legislative meeting on Dec. 21. He said the plan would need the legislators' approval by then to meet the February deadline.
Mr. Sabatino said the Legislature had overruled the council in the past. But a Legislator who favors the county purchase, Nora Bredes, a Democrat from Stony Brook, said rejection of the council's recommendation would almost certainly be challenged in court by an environmental group.
"It would be very foolish to ignore the council," she said. "It would only guarantee further litigation."
In September, a task force created by Governor Cuomo to study the economic and environmental needs of eastern Long Island asked Mr. Cuomo to help the county buy the island. Mr. Cuomo announced several days later that the state would provide half the $9.2 million purchase price.
But in a letter dated Nov. 8, Mr. Gaffney told Mr. Cuomo the state would have to "commit no less than $9.2 million" toward purchase of the island by Dec. 14.
 
'A Gift Horse'
 Mr. Gaffney has argued that the plan to sell to Robis assures preservation of nearly all of the island at no cost to the county, and would also allow county residents to visit the part of the island within the conservation easement.
The chairman of Mr. Cuomo's task force, Thomas A. Twomey Jr., said Mr. Gaffney's rejection of Mr. Cuomo's offer for the state to pay half the purchase price was "a perfect example of looking a gift horse in the mouth."
Mr. Gaffney's proposal "would create a private, exclusive compound for a very few rich and famous individuals," Mr. Twomey said. He said that promises of public access were untrue because visits would be strictly limited and require approval of the island's property owners.

HEADLINE: A Poll Shows Cuomo Rating Sliding Lower

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 18

 BODY:
As he nears a decision about running for a fourth term, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's approval ratings continue to slide, according to an independent statewide poll released today. But the poll shows the Governor with a comfortable lead over the little-known Republicans who may challenge him in 1994.
Only 34 percent of the registered voters questioned by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion said they considered Mr. Cuomo's performance in office either excellent or good. That approval rating is the lowest registered by Marist in Mr. Cuomo's 11 years in office and is 6 percentage points lower than in the last Marist poll, taken in May.
 
Half Say No 4th Term
 Half of those surveyed said they did not want Mr. Cuomo to run for another four-year term, while 40 percent said he should seek re-election. Fifty-nine percent said they thought New York was going in the wrong direction, compared with 26 percent who approved of the state's direction. 
 The poll of 730 registered voters was conducted on Nov. 15-16 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The Marist numbers are comparable to the results of a poll released nine days ago by the John Zogby Group of New Hartford, near Utica. It showed Mr. Cuomo with a 38 percent favorable rating among likely voters. Fifty-six percent said the Governor should not run.
Mr. Cuomo has said he will announce his decision by Jan. 1. A dozen Republicans, none with significant name recognition, are seeking support for the nomination.
In the Marist poll, none of four Republicans received more than 27 percent in a head-to-head contest against Mr. Cuomo.
Bill Green, a former Representative from Manhattan, received 27 percent to Mr. Cuomo's 46 percent; Herbert London, a former Conservative Party gubernatorial nominee, 26 percent to Mr. Cuomo's 48 percent; State Senator George E. Pataki of Peekskill, 24 percent to Mr. Cuomo's 48 percent; and Richard M. Rosenbaum, a former Republican state chairman, 25 percent to Mr. Cuomo's 48 percent.
The poll also showed that 57 percent thought Mr. Cuomo has "generally been a good governor" since taking office in 1983, while 35 percent thought he has not been.
Those figures tend to validate Mr. Cuomo's argument that recent polls reflect a frustration with the state's drowsy economy and its epidemic of crime. But elections, he says, are contests between individuals, not referendums on the incumbent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Continue Their Broad Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
For the second day, stocks continued their across-the-board retreat, as a slumping bond market and rising fears of inflation led to an investor selloff in equities.
Traders said investors were using the approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement on Wednesday as a reason for cashing in on the run up in stocks before the vote. 
 Others said a weak bond market and movement out of groups including telecommunications equipment stocks were also weighing on the market.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 19.01 points, to 3,685.34, as volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 313.5 million shares, a little off the pace of Wednesday's 319.6 million shares. Decliners held a wide lead over gainers, 1,276 to 795.
Chevron a component stock in the Dow, fell by 4 points, to 89, and accounted for 8.94 points of the index's decline, according to Birinyi Associates. The stock fell after the sale of more than 8.1 million common shares of Chevron common held by Pennzoil, which rose 5/8, to 58 1/8. The big block trade totaled more than $731 million.
 
Other Large Block Trades
 Other large block trades included two multimillion-share blocks of FPL Group Inc. Investors tried to capture a regular quarterly dividend payout of 62 cents a share, with today being the last day investors can buy the stock and receive the dividend. About 18.7 million shares changed hands as the day's most actively traded stock slipped 3/8 to close at 37 1/8.
An early-morning rally was expected following the passage of the free trade agreement, but it did not materialize. The market instead was placed on the defensive by a sharp drop in Treasury bonds, which may have been reacting to a larger-than-expected drop in United States jobless claims.
Abraham J. Bronchtein, director of research for the Portfolio Group Inc., the investment subsidiary of Chemical Bank, said yesterday was probably an acceleration of fears rooted in the strengthening of the economy and its impact on interest rates.
"People are have been worrying about rates for several weeks and I think anybody watching the market has seen a lot of profit taking in all the winning groups," Mr. Bronchtein said. "It started in the financials, I think it's now spreading into all other high tech and telecommunication stocks that got pumped up because of the Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications deal." Shares of telecommunications equipment makers dropped yesteray after two major companies failed to beat analysts' earnings estimates. American depository receipts of L.M. Ericsson Telephone fell 7 7/8, to 42 5/8, as Newbridge Networks fell 3 1/2, to 54 1/2. The fall in the two companies' shares helped drag down the shares of Motorola, which closed at 95 5/8, down 4 1/8.
Analysts at MMS International note the market remains concerned by the breakdown in the broader market, as the Nasdaq composite picked up where it left off on Wednesday. As the composite slipped below the 760 level, traders braced themselves for a retest of the 750-748 critical bottom support area. The Nasdaq composite closed down 8.02 points, to 754.34.
"I think the things that are making investors worry about interest rates should ultimately lead to better corporate profits," Mr. Bronchtein of Portfolio Group said. There is a gap between converting an improving economy into profits for a large number of companies. And until you get the higher earnings to support current market prices we'll continue to get this volatility."
Elsewhere, American Barrick fell 1 5/8, to 27 5/8, after the Horsham Corporation, its controling shareholder, announced a $550 million sale of convertible debt into Barrick stock.
As American Airlines flight attendants went out on strike, some investors headed for their brokers. The stock was down 7/8, to 69.
The Cholestech Corporation gained 1 7/8 to close at 27 5/8 after Kemper Securities upgraded its rating to a "strong buy" from a long-term buy. The company makes medical-diagnostic systems that measure blood cholesterol. It received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market two new diagnostic test panels.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Notes and Bonds in Fall

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Good economic news is continuing to be bad news for the bond market.
More reports yesterday showing that the economy is picking up pace helped send the prices of Treasury notes and bonds down across the board while yields, which move in the opposite direction, rose. The yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.24 percent, its highest close since Aug. 18. 
 The Clinton Administration victory on the North American Free Trade Agreement seemed to provide no boost for the market, as the old adage of buy on the rumor and sell on the fact took hold once again. What lift there was for the market had come earlier in the week when it became evident that the House of Representatives would approve the treaty linking the markets of the United States, Canada and Mexico.
The two reports yesterday that added to the picture of a stronger economy were minor by typical market standards, but when added to the recent data showing increases in auto sales, retail sales, housing starts and industrial production, they may have provided traders with a reason to sell.
One report showed that initial jobless claims had dropped by 20,000 in the week ending Nov. 13. The other report was the second consecutive sharp jump in the manufacturing index of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Its index in November rose to 22.4 from 15.1.
"The economic statistics continue to show a pattern of increasing growth," said Skip Shaw, who becomes president of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company at the beginning of next year. "Our belief is that we have seen the low in rates and that we will now trade higher" in an irregular pattern.
Also weighing on the market yesterday were continued rumors that the Treasury might issue new 30-year bonds in an effort to ease the shortage of the bond in the market, which could be distorting market prices. The Treasury had no comment. But more and more market analysts are suggesting that the conditions for such a move exist.
 
Treasury Partly Responsible
 The Treasury itself has been partly responsible for the problem because it decided last May to reduce the annual sale of 30-year bonds by about 40 percent and to shift to two auctions instead of four auctions a year.
In late trading in the secondary market, the price of the 6.25 percent 30-year bond was down 29/32 as the yield moved to 6.24 percent, from 6.18 percent Wednesday. The price of the two-year note dropped 5/32 as its yield jumped to 4.13 percent from 4.06 percent the day before.
The leap in short-term interest rates appears to be in response to fears that the stronger growth in the economy will make the Federal Reserve worry more about inflation and, in turn, raise its target for the short-term interest rate, which has been 3 percent for more than a year.
While the victory on the North American Free Trade Agreement did not give a boost to the United States bond market, it did seem to help in Mexico. According to Robert J. O'Donnell, a managing director at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, the yield on six-month Mexican paper dropped about half a percentage point, to 12.25 percent. The Mexican peso also got a boost, jumping more than 2 percent in value against the American dollar.
The victory for the trade accord also helped Mexico with the credit-rating agencies. The Standard & Poor's Corporation said that it was changing its outlook on Mexico from stable to positive.
Referring to the approval of the trade accord, S.& P. said, "The agreement should boost economic growth over the medium term, trigger new overseas equity inflows, and reduce reliance on external borrowing to finance Mexico's subtantial current account deficit - estimated by S.& P. at $22 billion," or 6 percent of the country's gross domestic product in 1993.
The S.& P. rating for Mexico is BB+, which is below investment grade. Duff & Phelps, which raised its rating of Mexico to an investment grade triple-B in May, said that "Mexico's strong fundamental policies will be strengthened by Nafta's passage."

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Says Fed May Raise Rates

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted today that the Federal Reserve would soon push up short-term interest rates because of concerns that the inflation rate had stopped falling.
The Paris-based organization, which promotes economic cooperation among its 24 member nations, said in a new study that "there is good reason to expect inflation to remain below 3 percent," but added that with short-term rates so low, unemployment edging down and factory utilization rising, monetary tightening could be justified to head off a resurgence of inflation. 
 In its annual grading of America's economic performance, the organization -- which normally takes a tough stance on inflation -- added that "tightening could also be justified if" inflationary "expectations need a jolt and the Federal Reserve's credibility is endangered."
 
'Real' Rates: Zero Percent
 Peter Jarrett, the economist who wrote the study, said in an interview that if the Fed decided to raise short-term rates, that should not in turn push up long-term interest rates, because the Fed would be showing its determination to keep inflation low.
The O.E.C.D. expressed concern that "real" short-term rates -- nominal rates minus the inflation rate -- were zero percent. Mr. Jarrett said rates at that level were highly stimulative and could reignite inflation.
Fed officials declined today to respond to the report.
In what was probably the most pointed section of its report, the organization criticized the Clinton Administration's efforts to pressure Japan to open its markets and agree to specific targets for reducing its trade surplus and increasing imports. The report said this approach ran the risk of creating managed trade, and might result in the "cartelization" of Japanese markets.
It also questioned the usefulness of Washington's pressure campaign, saying that even if the Clinton Administration succeeded in persuading Japan to reduce trade barriers, this was unlikely to do much to reduce the American trade deficit with Japan.
Mr. Jarrett said the Clinton Administration challenged this part of the report more than any other. The Administration has repeatedly argued that efforts to press Japan to import more promotes freer trade, rather than managed trade.
 
Sees More Growth
 Each year the O.E.C.D.'s secretariat issues a report that assesses the economic policies and problems of each member nation.
The study forecast a slight rise in American economic growth to a moderate 3 percent next year, with an increase in the trade deficit and another moderate drop in the unemployment rate, currently 6.8 percent.
"While this may appear to some as a disappointing picture, it is actually rather satisfactory," the report said. The organization was less sanguine about long-term growth prospects, saying the nation's potential growth rate was a lackluster 2.3 percent.
In another piece of bad news, the report said that because of slow productivity growth, the United States would lose its worldwide lead in productivity per worker within a decade.
 Probably the biggest long-term problem for the American economy, the O.E.C.D. said, is inadequate savings. This holds back the nation's ability to increase educational skills and expand plants and equipment, in turn inhibiting productivity growth.
After years of criticizing the United States for not tackling its budget deficit, the organization praised President Clinton's deficit-reduction efforts, but suggested that a new round of cuts might be required by 1998.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fall in Week

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 18

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 20,000 last week, erasing the previous week's jump that had lifted claims to a 15-week high, the Government said today.
The Labor Department said new applications for unemployment insurance totaled 338,000, down from a revised 358,000 during the week that ended on Nov. 6. It was the largest decline since claims fell by 56,000 during the week that ended on July 31.
Last week included the Veterans Day holiday. Claims often fall during a holiday week because of the fewer number of days in which to file claims. 
 The Nov. 6 figure, originally estimated to be 354,000, was the highest since 395,000 claims were filed during the week that ended on July 24.
The less-volatile four-week moving average of jobless claims, which analysts prefer to track because it smooths out the weekly spikes, also fell. The average totaled 345,500, down from 348,750 during the period that ended on Nov. 6.
The report also said 5,116 applications were filed under a Federal emergency unemployment program during the week that ended on Nov. 6, up from 4,747 during the previous week.
That number reflected people still eligible to file under the emergency program before it expired on Oct. 2. The House and Senate have approved differing versions of legislation to extend the program, and those differences must be reconciled before final passage. President Clinton supports an extension.
States reporting the biggest increases in claims last week were California, Ohio and Pennsylvania; Texas led states with declines.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises, With Victory For Trade Accord a Factor

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened slightly yesterday, partly in reaction to House approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Traders said the dollar was also bolstered by positive economic signals in the United States and expectations of lower interest rates in Europe. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar jumped to 1.7125 German marks, from 1.7035 marks on Wednesday. The dollar also rose to 107.35 Japanese yen from 106.85 yen.
Gold prices were lower in the United States after rising in Europe. Gold for December delivery fell 50 cents, to $376.70 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
 
 
 
European Rate Cuts Expected
 Widespread expectations for another round of interest rate cuts in big European countries, including Germany and France, helped to buoy the dollar, analysts said.
"European interest rates are slated to come down against a background of strong economic data in the United States," said Benoit Jadoul, vice president for foreign exchange at Chase Manhattan Bank. He cited a decision by Belgium's central bank to cut interest rates sharply on Wednesday, along with a new Government austerity program.
The German Bundesbank is expected to reduce rates before the end of the year, said Curtis Perkins, a trader at Chemical Bank. The Bundesbank hinted at an easier monetary policy when its rate on repurchase agreements, a tool of short-term monetary policy, came in lower than expected on Thursday, he said.
Also aiding the dollar was new evidence of American economic growth. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve issued its November business outlook survey, a closely watched measure of East Coast manufacturing activity, which said manufacturing continued to improve. The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off workers filing claims for jobless benefits fell last week by 20,000, the biggest drop in nearly four months. Both reports supported the dollar.
Mr. Perkins said another factor helping the dollar was the decisive House vote Wednesday night to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Clinton Administration said the pact, which liberalizes trade among the United States, Canada and Mexico, will help the United States become more competitive overseas.
The British pound, meanwhile, slipped to $1.4760 in New York trading, from $1.4805 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: After the Nafta Victory

 BODY:
A neophyte watching the House vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement could be excused for thinking President Clinton was the leader of the Republican Party, supported by a minority of the Democratic Party. But however odd the coalition -- 132 Republicans and only 102 Democrats -- Mr. Clinton won a small economic and huge political victory in pushing Nafta through the House.
Nafta will open Mexico's borders to more U.S. exports and investment, a worthwhile achievement. More important, the Nafta win empowers Mr. Clinton to complete the more important Uruguay Round of international trade talks. And the vote tells Congress that the White House knows how to play tough, which should make health care and welfare reform a bit easier to achieve. 
 Critics accuse Mr. Clinton of buying the Nafta vote at taxpayer expense. But he bought victory remarkably cheaply. For all the wheeling and dealing, Mr. Clinton did not -- based on what's been made public -- gut Nafta, undermine the Uruguay Round or saddle future taxpayers with a big bill.
For example, he promised wheat and peanut growers that he would investigate Canadian export policy; but this poses little danger to consumers or Canada because any action the U.S. might take could be appealed to an impartial panel. He promised vegetable and citrus growers that he would limit tariff cuts on their products under the Uruguay Round; but he can do that without violating the draft agreement under negotiation. And, the President did not, as environmentalists feared, ease restrictions on pesticides.
With Nafta won, President Clinton can now move on to the Uruguay Round, which must be negotiated by Dec. 15 to meet a Congressional deadline. Under the draft accord, tariffs and other trade barriers on food, services, foreign investment and copyright materials would come tumbling down -- each of which would help the U.S. economy.
The agreement promises to add hundreds of billions of dollars to the world economy. But finalizing the deal won't be easy. Mr. Clinton will have to overcome opposition from the domestic textile industry and the French Government, which threatens to undermine the entire agreement for the sake of a handful of farmers.
Next, Mr. Clinton has to make good on his promise to send Congress a bill early next year that would provide dislocated workers substantial training and education. With or without Nafta, millions of Americans will lose long-held jobs because of transformations within the U.S. economy. The compassionate answer is to provide opportunities to acquire new skills.
President Clinton has set out the right vision: an America that opens its borders to foreign goods in return for similar access abroad; an America that provides ample resources to train its workers so they achieve high productivity and, therefore, high wages. Nafta is only the first step.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Defining Bill Clinton

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Billions to buy Congressional votes and a fist in the face to American labor -- after less than a year in office, that is what Clinton idealism came down to in the Nafta debate.
Now the President is in Seattle to face a different problem of political morality: the human right of Chinese men and women to live, work and talk without fear of years in torture cells -- to fight for it or not. 
 The President can use the new strength he claims from his Nafta victory, one of two ways. He can push Beijing toward human decency for Chinese who do not bow their minds to Communism, and for the people of Tibet, captive and brutalized for almost a half-century.
Or he can do what appeals now to some politicians and journalists who once talked big about human rights in China -- give the issue a little pious attention but quickly get down to political and business deals. All right, maybe that will help the Communists and their army. But hey, it is a big-boys world and maybe the deals will help some American businesses with the bottom line.
At least show time in Seattle will not be as expensive for the taxpayer as voting time in Washington.
On both sides of Nafta were honest opinions in the House of Representatives. One was that Nafta would open a new era of open trade. The other was that the treaty as written would be like a small cat with tiger fangs -- -- interesting but nothing to have around the house.
Opponents saw Nafta as a perpetuation of Mexican conditions that no American worker could or should compete with -- child labor, peon wages, government union-busting.
Afraid to leave the decision to a clean ballot, the Administration bought votes with tariff breaks and other goodies: for members from citrusland, for sugar, for peanuts, bed frames, wine, wheat, manhole covers.
The money comes from the taxpayer. As for the bill -- who will ever add it up? The White House?
As bad as bribes was the campaign of distortion about the beliefs and emotions of American workers. They were not fighting against free trade, as the Nafta lobbyists said, but against a perversion of free trade that could send hundreds of thousands of them into the humiliating wasteland of unemployment -- them, not some other person.
Lane Kirkland, A.F.L.-C.I.O. president, says he asked the Administration, Mr. Clinton included, to insist on strict enforcement against built-in Mexican competition-killers. He said he wanted no more than the enforcement Nafta gives against violations of intellectual property -- patents, royalties and so on.
The Administration said yes, according to Mr. Kirkland. Only when it failed to come through, he says, did labor go into the field against Nafta.
Mr. Clinton's "victory" forced into opposition millions of working people who had voted for him. They (and I) would have supported Nafta, if they had been given the safeguards granted to Americans who produce "intellectual property."
Vice President Gore gave an overdue thrashing to Ross Perot. But the Administration's contempt for labor's opinions allows Mr. Perot to prance about as labor's savior -- early Christmas for that peculiar man.
If this political spectacle, this open government vote-buying and bone-breaking, had taken place in Japan, say, or India or Italy, American correspondents in those countries would have filed astonished stories about the strange ways of the natives.
But when it happened in Washington, American journalism, by and large, positively glowed with admiration. Man, see how tough Bill Clinton is, how at last he knows how to bait with money, like other Presidents.
American correspondents abroad get rotated every few years so they don't start to think widow-burning is normal, even admirable -- or vote-buying with public money.
President Clinton said Nafta was the "defining" moment for America. I doubt that, but after the moral debacle of the Nafta debate, Seattle certainly will help "define" the Clinton Administration. Is it recasting itself in the Bushbaker mold -- tough guy, power pol, cash register uber alles? Or does the Administration remember the title of that Clinton-Gore campaign book, "Putting People First"?
Chinese dissidents, Tibetan captives, Mexican children forced to labor, American union members, you could say they are all people.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Now, Be the President

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

 BODY:
The last week may have been the turning point for a flagging Presidency. It can be if Bill Clinton acts on the lessons of his two triumphs in that week.
The Nafta vote in the House was the second. President Clinton showed that he could work the political system to overcome the odds and win a tough one: win big. He trounced the strange collection of Yesterday's Men who thought they had him beat: Ross Perot, Lane Kirkland, Pat Buchanan, Ralph Nader et al. 
 Mr. Clinton's first triumph was a speech last Saturday at the Church of God in Christ, in Memphis. What he did there was in its way as surprising as the winning effort on Nafta.
From the pulpit where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke the night before he was assassinated in 1968, Mr. Clinton gave passionate voice to Americans' concerns about crime. He imagined what Dr. King would say if he could see his community today:
"I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed. . . . I fought to stop white people being so filled with hate that they would wreak violence on black people. I did not fight for the right of black people to murder other black people . . . ."
In Memphis Mr. Clinton broke out of the pattern of political speeches, of the expected and the calculated. He spoke as if from inside himself, responding in emotional terms to the appalling reality in this country today.
The response he got shows that one thing Americans want a President to do is to speak out about wrongs: not always to have a 10-point plan, a graph, but to speak. No one person can solve our problem of social decay, but the President can make us face it. That is Teddy Roosevelt's bully pulpit.
The Nafta saga has another lesson. To be effective, a President must focus on objectives crucial to him and the country. And then he must be resolute in pursuit of those objectives.
Mr. Clinton was slow to focus on Nafta. While he delayed, opponents got commitments from a lot of House Democrats who could have been won for the treaty. The opposition got so far ahead that many expected the President to back away from Nafta. Instead he went all-out and won.
Too often before now Mr. Clinton has backed away from declared positions. There was a widespread belief in Washington that if you made something difficult for him, he would cave. In politics that perception is disabling. Mr. Clinton will have dispelled it if he follows up his Nafta performance with resolve on other issues.
Not just Congress but the world is ready for resolute American Presidential leadership. Many issues await it:
GATT. Only a few weeks remain to conclude the Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations, far more important economically than Nafta. The negotiations will not succeed without a real push from the President.
Haiti. Mr. Clinton has allowed America to be pushed around by a few hundred goons. Does he mean it when he says he is committed to dislodging the coup leaders? If so, it is time to take more determined action, not excluding the use of military force.
It is past time to stop the C.I.A from undermining his Haitian policy. The agency has been pushing vicious descriptions of President Aristide based on interviews with the very men who overthrew him. Who does the C.I.A. think is the President, Bill Clinton or Jesse Helms?
Bosnia. Without going back over the question of stopping Serbian aggression, Mr. Clinton can do much to prevent the tragedy from becoming worse. Indeed, he may be the only person who can prevent human disaster from occurring in Bosnia this winter on a massive scale.
The first snow has fallen in Sarajevo. Supplies of food are inadequate, and the Serbs have again cut the flow of natural gas. They continue to block relief shipments, and they are shelling other Muslim enclaves that are supposedly safe havens.
Mr. Clinton can at least speak out about the need to get relief through, focusing the world's attention on the problem. He can launch an airlift to Sarajevo and Gorazde Airports -- parachute drops are inadequate, especially in winter. He can warn Serbia to stop blocking the gas supply or see its own cut off.
Mr. Clinton, in short, should be the President. He knows how.

HEADLINE: A Risky Victory

BYLINE: By Ted Van Dyk; Ted Van Dyk is a Democratic strategist and trade policy analyst.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The House's passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement was no triumph for enlightenment.
Nafta is likely to create modest economic growth in Mexico, the United States and Canada, even while creating near-term dislocations. But the victory could induce the Administration to make misjudgments that could sink the far more important global negotiations in the 116-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which face a Dec. 15 deadline for completion. 
 Nafta's most important immediate effect will be to rescue Presidents Clinton and Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico from personal political setbacks.
The idea of a free trade zone had been around for 40 years before George Bush's espousal of it midway through his term. He supported it not out of any measured political and economic assessment but for the same reason he had chosen Dan Quayle as his running mate: he wanted to reward and encourage a young man to whom he had taken a liking.
The young man was Mr. Salinas. Trying to modernize and open the corrupt, protected and state-dominated Mexican economy (and deflect charges that his Presidential election had been stolen), Mr. Salinas wanted Nafta as his centerpiece initiative.
Nafta had not been pursued earlier by the U.S., Mexico and Canada for valid and substantive reasons. First, Mexico was far less advanced and economically open than the other two. If this were the 1960's, Nafta would be akin to an embryonic European Community of Germany, France and Spain; Spain would need years of economic, financial, political and social adjustment to truly fit with the others.
Second, as a regional bloc Nafta will be at odds with the international trade and investment system represented in GATT. Countries not in Nafta will be on the outside looking in, and will face discrimination against their products. Caribbean chiefs of state already have protested.
By suggesting that Nafta should be expanded gradually southward into Latin America -- and implying that the U.S. should consider joining a new Pacific bloc -- Mr. Clinton, perhaps unknowingly, has undermined the global regime of economic and financial liberalization that has served the postwar world so well. Faced with Nafta and the European Community, Japan is considering forming a new regional group with itself at the center. Other countries are also looking for a regional club to join.
The White House portrayed Nafta as a way to gain an edge on Western Europe and Japan, both beset by economic stagnation. This was the wrong reason to argue for completion of a North American deal. Western Europe and Japan, our principal security and economic partners, are in trouble; their cooperation is indispensable for global progress. They are not mere commercial rivals.
Mr. Salinas and his Institutional Revolutionary Party will now face slightly less pressure to conduct genuinely honest elections next year. His economic liberalization will doubtless continue, and Mexico probably will not revert to hyper-nationalist policies. But the cost will be high: one-party, oligarchic domination for yet another six years by corrupt conquistadores posing as statesmen and national leaders.
Canada, always something of a bystander in the three-way negotiations, must decide what it will do about the trade sanctions Mr. Clinton imposed on its products as he sought farm-state votes for Nafta. The new Government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, already forced to cope with Quebec separatism, may have little choice but to respond in kind to what Canadians consider bullying tactics.
Mr. Clinton's Nafta victory saves him from immediate damage to his Presidency. But the price he paid for victory will be steep. It includes billions in spending obligations to buy key House votes. And his trade actions against Canada and other partners will make it more difficult to complete the GATT deal on time.
Mr. Clinton's confrontation with the labor movement over Nafta may well poison his relationship with it, at least for the time being, and make it harder to advance his health care reforms.
His incredible promise to House Republicans that he would protect them next year if they were attacked for pro-Nafta votes cannot be kept. It has angered members of his party and core Democratic constituencies whose concerns go beyond Nafta.
The Administration would do well to curtail its recent boasting that "Nafta will send a message to Japan and Europe" and force them into high-noon concessions in the final stages of the GATT talks.
The Nafta victory will be hollow if Mr. Clinton uses it to try to bulldoze the rest of the world in the Pacific talks in Seattle -- and then at the GATT talks -- into accepting U.S. commercial ultimatums. America's choice about GATT, not Nafta, will provide real proof of whether we are optimistic and open or defeatist and closed.

HEADLINE: FUNDS WATCH;
Lower Interest Rates Favor Treasury Funds

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
For the last three years, the story among the 46 Treasury bond funds has been interest rates.
Unlike the United States Government bond funds, Treasury funds do not buy agency or mortgage issues. And Treasuries carry virtually no credit risk. So shifts in interest rates create straightforward changes in their share prices. 
As rates fall, bond prices rise, and the longer a bond's duration (its maturity plus some other factors), the better the bond performs. Conversely, bond prices fall when rates rise.
The best performers among the Treasury funds have been long-term zero-coupon bonds. (For the purposes of this ranking, Benham's other target maturity funds, and the Scudder Zero Coupon 2000, also a target maturity fund, were eliminated.) Next in performance were long-term funds, and then intermediate funds.
No one can predict with certainty what direction interest rates will take, though the dominant view is that rates will rise only slightly over the next year. Conservative investors can hedge their bets by owning shares in intermediate-term Treasury funds, said John Rekenthaler, the editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, in Chicago.

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES BROAD CRIME BILL; SPLITS OVER GUNS

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The Senate today overwhelmingly passed a broad and expensive anticrime package whose leading provisions would add 100,000 police officers to the nation's streets, build a network of high-security regional prisons and create more boot camps for young offenders.
But a related and more contentious piece of legislation, the Brady gun-control bill, stumbled badly when its supporters failed tonight to break a Republican-led filibuster against it. That development appeared to doom the bill's chances for two months at the very least, until after the Senate returns in late January from its winter recess. 
 Supporters of the Brady bill, which would require that every buyer of a handgun wait five business days before taking possession of it, had hoped to have the legislation on President Clinton's desk by Thanksgiving. But they failed twice today to shut off debate. The first vote, this afternoon, was 57 in favor of cloture -- 3 fewer than needed -- and 42 against. The second, late tonight, was 57 to 41.
 
$23 Billion Package
 The broader anticrime package that passed today, a product of lawmakers' new sense of urgency stemming from a public outcry over violence, would cost $23 billion over five years. That would amount to a sixfold increase in the annual subsidy that Washington now gives to state and local governments to fight crime.
It is unclear how big a part of this new assistance would flow to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Even the smallest of the 50 states would receive millions of dollars, but the bulk of the package would be disbursed by the Justice Department on review of applications filed by the states and on the basis of crime rates and other barometers of need.
Still, New York State officials said they hoped to obtain $1 billion of the aid, and New York City has said it hopes to add 5,000 police officers over the next five years as a result of the bill.
The legislation's passage, by a vote of 95 to 4, followed years of gridlock that had killed less ambitious anticrime measures. Senate leaders were able to avoid an impasse this time by stitching together a variety of provisions that allowed conservatives and liberals alike to claim victory.
"This is the finest anticrime package in history," said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. "It has the right combination of tough-on-crime provisions and prevention."
On the Democratic side, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the commmittee's chairman, said: "Conscience and convenience have crossed paths. We're finally beginning to listen to the American people. People are prisoners in their neighborhoods, prisoners in their houses."
 
Headed for Conference
 The bill was opposed by only two Democrats and two Republicans, and now heads with significant momentum for a conference early next year between the Senate and the House, which two weeks ago passed a series of far more modest anticrime measures. Congressional leaders expect that the compromise that emerges from the conference committee will be taken up by both houses promptly and be ready for President Clinton's signature by spring.
House Democratic leaders, who allowed the Senate to assume chief responsibility for drafting the crime package, hope that the final version will closely resemble the Senate bill.
But those same leaders doubt that it will include a Senate provision that would prohibit the further manufacture of 19 kinds of military-style firearms. Largely because of Western and Southern lawmakers from rural districts who are particularly sensitive to the demands of hunting interests, the House has repeatedly turned back similar curbs on long-barrel weapons.
 
Intense Lobbying on Brady Bill
 By contrast, the Brady bill cleared the House with relative ease last week. But today it ran headlong into the Republican filibuster in the Senate, where it had been killed twice in earlier years, and once again it came out the loser.
The bill's opponents were able to fend off cloture despite a daylong lobbying effort by the Clinton Administration. Attorney General Janet Reno visited lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Vice President Al Gore lobbied them by telephone, and Mr. Clinton, in Seattle for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference, issued a statement there that called on the Senate to break the filibuster and pass the bill.
But the National Rifle Association and its allies, who argued that the bill would pose no threat to criminals and instead inconvenience only the law-abiding, had also engaged in a furious lobbying campaign in recent days, and in the end they were the victors.
The Brady bill is named for one of its chief advocates, James S. Brady, the White House press secretary who was disabled by gunfire in the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Its waiting-period requirement is intended to give law-enforcement authorities time to check the background of every handgun buyer for evidence of a criminal or mentally unstable past.
Mr. Brady's wife, Sarah, who accompanied Attorney General Reno to lobby for the bill at the Capitol today, expressed anger that it could not be passed despite the clear majority support that it enjoyed in the Senate. "This isn't the way democracy should work," Mrs. Brady said of the filibuster.
The debate on the Brady bill was intense. Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, said that if it was not passed, "we will have blood on our hands." Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, countered by citing the Second Amendment's guarantee of citizens' right to bear arms. "An armed citizenry," he said, "is not going to become an oppressed citizenry."
 
Victory for Clinton
 Debate on the Brady bill began today immediately after approval of the broader anticrime legislation. Unlike the outcome on Brady, that measure's passage was a victory for Mr. Clinton, who campaigned for the Presidency last year on a promise of one of the bill's central provisions: pouring 100,000 new police officers over the next five years into state and local efforts against crime.
And it was an easy victory, at that. Given public pressure on lawmakers to do something about violence -- pressure that became all the more evident during a number of election campaigns this fall, when crime emerged as a defining issue -- Mr. Clinton did not have to engage in much lobbying on behalf of the bill. And he had virtually nothing to do with the compromises that made its passage possible.
It was those compromises that allowed lawmakers of every stripe to find at least something about the legislation that pleased them.
Liberals won the ban on an array of assault weapons, as well as programs that would provide treatment for drug-abusing prisoners and members of youth gangs. Conservatives won a provision that would broaden the death penalty so that it applied to a total of 52 Federal crimes, and they also achieved a mandate requiring states that accept Federal money for construction of the new regional prisons to insure that violent offenders serve at least 85 percent of the prison terms to which they are sentenced.
To be sure, some parts of the anticrime package are little more than symbolism, a result of political grandstanding at a time when voters are demanding action against street violence. There is, for instance, a provision that would apply the death penalty to cases of genocide, and another that would loosen rules of admissibility of evidence in cases of child molestation, an offense that is rarely adjudicated in the Federal courts.
Nonetheless, the bill would bring a remarkable surge in Federal resources earmarked to fight gang violence, prison overcrowding and such offenses as rape and hate crimes.
The $23 billion that the bill would authorize in spending over five years amounts, on an annual basis, to roughly six times the $756 million a year that the Government now provides for state and local law enforcement. In real terms -- that is, when inflation is taken into account -- that current level is only a third of what Washington provided in such help two decades ago.
The source of all the new billions in spending would be the Federal work-force reductions, so far unspecified, that have emerged as a central part of the Vice President's campaign to streamline the Government.
To make sure that the new money would be spent in the way that the bill envisions, the legislation specifies that state and local governments would not be permitted to use it to replace money that they divert from crime-fighting to other programs.
The crime bill takes a two-front approach.
The first, the one with the greatest emphasis, is law enforcement and punishment. About a third of the $23 billion, the biggest single chunk of the package, would pay for the training and hiring of the new police officers. In addition, the legislation would provide the states $3 billion to finance construction of the 10 new regional prisons, the aim being to ease prison overcrowding that frequently forces the release of violent offenders.
There are a variety of other enforcement provisions as well, one of which would provide $200 million in college scholarships to students who commit themselves to serve as police officers for four years after graduation.
 
 
 
MAJOR PROVISIONS OF THE CRIME BILL
 Bans the manufacture, sale and possession of 19 semiautomatic assault weapons and clips designed to feed more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Specifically exempts more than 650 hunting weapons, in addition to assault weapons that have been already manufactured.
 
Some Examples
A. Tech-9 -- 9-mm assault pistol manufactured by Intratec in the United States.
 
B. Uzi -- 9-mm assault pistol manufactured in Israel.
 
C. Ar-15 -- Assault rifle manufactured in the Unites States by Colt.
 
OTHER IMPORTANT PROVISIONS
 
Authorizes $8.9 billion to put 100,00 new police officers on the nation's streets over the next five years.
 
Authorizes $3 billion for construction of regional high-security prisons and another $3 billion for boot camps for young offenders and other innovative correctional programs.
 
Prohibits the sale or transfer of guns to minors.
 
Authorizes $1.8 billion to combat violence against women. Stregnthens Federal laws against battery and other abuse, sets up a special phone line to report domestic violence and toughens Federal sentences for sex crimes.
 
Makes certain gang activities Federal offenses, ranging from conspiring to join a criminal street gang to committing murder for that gang.
 
Expands the Federal death penalty to cover 52 offenses, including the slaying of Federal law-enforcement officers and drive by shootings.
 
Authorizes $1.2 billion for programs providing drug treatment, alternative punishments, job training and other preventive measures for nonviolent drug offenders who are sentenced to probation.
 
Authorizes $100 million in grants to schools for metal detectors and other security measures.
 
Authorizes $40 million to develop a national criminal background check on those who provide care to children, the elderly or the disabled.

HEADLINE: THE PACIFIC SUMMIT;
'DIALOGUE' IS BEGUN AS CLINTON MEETS WITH CHINA'S CHIEF

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 19

 BODY:
Having promised this morning to tread "a more constructive path" in relations with China, President Clinton met this evening with President Jiang Zemin, leader of the Chinese Communist Party, in the most important contact between the two countries since the massacre in Tiananmen Square in 1989. But little tangible progress was reported.
"I thought we began a dialogue," Mr. Clinton said afterward when asked whether he had made any headway in persuading the Chinese Government to lower trade barriers, limit missile sales and ease up on dissidents. He appeared subdued, and made it clear that there had been no real meeting of the minds between the two. 
 Mark Gearan, the White House communications director, said that the Chinese leader had delivered a 15-minute monologue about the "importance of noninterference in the internal affairs of other nations."
 
In Praise of Honesty
 As if to counter those in Congress and elsewhere who disapprove of meetings with Mr. Jiang or other members of the Chinese leadership without first extracting some quid pro quo, Mr. Clinton said, "I don't think that you ever lose anything by talking to someone, as long as you are honest."
In a continuing effort to loosen the linkage between human rights and commercial relations, the President argued that when China and the United States "work together, we are powerful force for security and economic progress." In effect, he said that abuses of civil liberties in China must not be ignored but must not be permitted to dominate the relationship -- a formulation remarkably like that which guided the Bush Administration and which Mr. Clinton roundly criticized during the 1992 campaign.
 
No Chinese Concessions
 In June, Mr. Clinton renewed trade benefits for China, but said he would not do so again next June unless Beijing's record on human rights improved substantially. Privately, he has said such improvements could not come on the eve of the renewal but must be made to build credibility over 12 months. The President gave no sign that he had received any major commitments during his 90-minute conversation this evening, but he noted pointedly the historic Chinese aversion to discussing such matters in public.
Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that progress had been made because the two sides had talked about the tough issues without stonewalling. But he reported no Chinese concessions, large or small, and used the words "frank" and "candid" to describe the encounter, which are diplomatic code for discussions that produce no measurable result.
Mr. Clinton came to this first summit meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum on the wings of his success in winning House approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement, and he sought to use that victory to generate support for a similar free-trade zone in the Pacific and for the long-stalled negotiations among 108 nations on new world trade rules.
"We hope to complete a triple play," Mr. Christopher declared.
The 16 Asian and Pacific foreign ministers gathered here issued a pointed statement intended to prod the Europeans, particularly the French, into completing the trade talks by Dec. 15. The talks, aimed at updating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have dragged on for seven years.
Pledging themselves to support further tariff cuts on products traded heavily by Pacific countries, including electronic goods, wood pulp and scientific instruments, the ministers said "the time for pledges and commitments is long past."
 
'Lively Discussion' Reported
 But there was far less unanimity on the eventual establishment of a free-trade area in the Pacific. Drawn from nations with widely differing cultures and with economies ranging from the rudimentary to the sophisticated, the ministers rejected a recommendation by a group of private experts that a commitment to free trade be made and officially announced by 1996.
The proposal, Mr. Christopher said, "provoked a lively discussion" during the three-day ministers' meeting here that made it evident that the organization is "not ready to reach that kind of definitive decision."
In addition, the Secretary signaled that the leaders would stay away, as much as possible, from potentially divisive political issues in their discussions on Blake Island, eight miles from Seattle in Puget Sound. He said that "one of the geniuses of APEC is that it focuses on economic development rather than political issues."
Mr. Clinton held a number of meetings with other Asian leaders, including Morihiro Hosokawa, the new Japanese Prime Minister.
American negotiators said that the long-discussed easing of the Japanese prohibition on rice imports did not come up during the main meeting between the two, at which advisers were present. Mr. Christopher said, however, that it came up at a subsequent private meeting, though he gave no details. Several Japanese sources said they were certain that Mr. Hosokawa had decided to modify the ban once his political reform measures have been enacted.
The rice question is important not only in terms of American exports but also because it is a major stumbling block to a new GATT agreement.
 
Seattle Is in Knots
 Seattle was tied into knots by the plethora of meetings involving the leaders and their ministers. Unaccustomed to gatherings of this sort, the Seattle police not only closed off streets, as is always the case at summit conferences, but halted elevators at many hotels for long periods and sealed other guests into their hotels while officials came and went.
But the city nonetheless embraced the meeting as a symbol of its own bright economic future as one of the American cities best situated to benefit from enhanced trade across the Pacific. This is exemplified by the sales of the Boeing Company, the largest American exporter, which sells vast quantities of jets to China and Japan and as part of sales agreements has agreed to the manufacture of fuselages and other items in those two nations.
Mayor Norm Rice and Gov. Mike Lowry, both Democrats, effusively introduced the President today for his fourth speech about trade with Asia since taking office. Behind Mr. Clinton as he spoke were symbols of the considerable regional pride of the Pacific Northwest: four enormous clamshell-shaped glass sculptures by Dale Chihuly, who works in a village named Pilchuck north of here.
Mr. Clinton painted a bright vision of an Asia-Pacific region with "robust and open economic competition," with "Japan fast becoming a model of political reform as well as an economic colossus" and China "playing a constructive regional and global leadership role while moving toward greater internal liberalization."
He compared the meeting here to those at the end of World War II that helped to build such international institutions as NATO, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. He added: "It took them a few years to put this together, and it wasn't self-evident at the time that it had to be done. We now have to bring the same level of vision to this time of change."
"Such goals extend beyond tomorrow's agenda," the President conceded at the end of his speech, "but they must not lie beyond our vision."
 
Computer Sale Confirmed
 The Administration confirmed that it had approved the sale of a Cray supercomputer to China for use in meteorology but tried to play down the significance of the move.
"They could go down to Radio Shack and buy a couple of personal computers and do the same thing," said Bowman Cutter, the deputy assistant to the President for economic policy.
In essence, the Administration gave China the computing power that it desperately sought a few years ago, but which today has more symbolic than practical value, in the hope that it might prompt the Chinese to make concessions on some major points.

HEADLINE: THE PACIFIC SUMMIT;
Clinton Sees Asia Exports as Key to Jobs

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 19

 BODY:
President Clinton today summoned the nation to look eastward now that the cold war has ended, asserting that unemployment in the United States can only be dealt with by expanding foreign trade and that the most dynamic markets for American exports are in Asia and the Pacific, not in Europe.
"The fastest-growing region is the Asian Pacific, a region that has to be vital for our future," Mr. Clinton said in a speech to representatives of the nations taking part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference. 
 In the span of a few years, the President added, these Asian economies have gone from being thought of as "dominos" in the struggle between Communism and democracy to "dynamos" driving the world economy.
Mr. Clinton argued that the United States today faced one of those hinges of history that come along every few generations, and the direction in which it now swings will be critical in determining the country's economic health and security for the coming generation.
 
'Security Is Tied to Economics'
 In this new era, the President declared, "We cannot let our national worries blind us to our national interests. More than ever our security is tied to economics. Military threats remain, and they require our vigilance and resolve, but increasingly our place in the world will be determined as much by the skills of our workers as by the strength of our weapons, as much by our ability to pull down foreign trade barriers as our ability to breach distant ramparts."
The President argued that exports have now become the "lifeblood" of American economic growth.
"This trend will continue," he said. "All wealthy nations are having difficulty creating jobs and raising incomes, even when there is economic growth. Why is that? Because workers in advanced countries must become ever more productive to deal with competition from low-wage countries on the one hand and high-skilled, high-tech countries on the other.
"Being more productive simply means that fewer and fewer people can produce more and more goods. And in an environment like that, if you want to increase jobs and raise incomes, the only way to do it is find more customers for each country's products. There is no alternative. We must compete, not retreat."
 
Call to Update Social Programs
 That was what drove him to push for the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Clinton said, and it is what impels him even more strongly to push for an expansion of American trade with Asia and the Pacific.
Mr. Clinton has told his aides that the purpose of this conference and the purpose of trying to develop this economic forum into something more concrete, is to insure that the United States and its businesses have a strong foothold in the Asian markets at a time when they are increasingly trading and investing with one another, and not the outside world.
The President noted that just as some of America's attitudes about foreign trade have been based on a world that no longer exists -- which was why the fight over the North American trade agreement was so difficult -- so America's unemployment system has been overtaken by global change and has to be revamped to keep the nation competitive.
He seemed to suggest that to get the free trade agreement passed he had had to dismantle the New Deal coalition of labor, minorities and big city Democrats, and replace it with a new coalition of high-tech workers from the Northwest and the South and big and small business. And now, to deal with unemployment, he indicated that he would have to dismantle the New Deal approach to that problem as well.
 
Retraining the Unemployed
 "The unemployment system," Mr. Clinton said, "was created at a time when the average length of unemployment was shorter than it is today and when the average unemployed person, when called back to work, went back to his or her former employer." So workers, he said, could draw money from unemployment insurance, their income would go down for a while and then they would be called back to the same job.
Today, most people are unemployed for much longer and rarely re-employed by the same company, so the current unemployment system is "now an unfair tax on employers and a rip-off for employees because it does not help them," Mr. Clinton said. That is why, the President said, his Administration wants to set up a new system where people who lose their jobs immediately begin retraining programs to learn new skills.
But putting America's domestic economy on a new track is not enough, the President said. While Europe remains at the core of American strategic alliances, Mr. Clinton said, "as our concern shifts to economic challenges we must look across the Pacific as well as the Atlantic."
While it is necessary for the Government to open markets that are being kept closed by Asian Pacific governments, American businessmen "have to do a better job of piercing those markets," Mr. Clinton said. "We cannot have customers where we are not there to make the sale."
To insure that the United States is not shut out, Mr. Clinton painted his vision of how the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum might be developed.
"We will propose a meeting of the APEC finance ministers to advance our dialogue on the broad issues affecting economic growth," Mr. Clinton said.
"We can't imagine now how we could have weathered the cold war without NATO. In the same way, future generations may look back and say they can't imagine how the Asian-Pacific region could have thrived in such a spirit of harmony without the existence of APEC."

HEADLINE: COALITION IN HOUSE MOVES ON DEFICIT

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The same kind of pot-luck stew of House Democrats and Republicans that just swept President Clinton's free trade accord to victory suddenly is threatening to give the White House an embarrassing drubbing on the year's most persistent political issue: reducing the deficit.
Without much fanfare, Representatives Timothy J. Penny, Democrat of Minnesota, and John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio, have pushed to a vote in the full House, probably on Monday, a proposal to cut an additional $90 billion from the Federal budget by 1998. They say Congress must approve the package, or something like it, if lawmakers are ever to convince voters that they have shed their spendthrift ways. 
 It is not clear whether they have the votes to do that. But the House leadership is fearful enough that it has already postponed the House vote, originally set for Saturday, to spend time twisting arms against it. And the White House is so anxious that it has dragooned Cabinet secretaries and top Clinton aides into a furious media campaign to paint the proposal as an assault on the nation's health and fiscal welfare.
 
'Immoral' Impact
 The White House budget director, Leon E. Panetta, summoned reporters to the White House today to call the plan's impact on Medicare recipients "immoral." Defense Secretary Les Aspin called its proposed cuts in military retirement benefits and other Pentagon spending "anti-family" and "a very, very severe blow" to the national security.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kasich, a young Republican who is seen as a comer on fiscal matters, and Mr. Penny, a fractious Democrat who says will retire after this term in disgust at Washington ways, claim at least 50 Democrats and the vast bulk of the House's 175 Republicans are on their side.
In an interview today, Mr. Penny guessed that another 50 Democrats are still up for grabs.
"We're not there yet," he said. "It's not going to be easy. But this vote, more than any in recent years, will define those legislators who are serious about solving the deficit problem and those who are part of the problem."
 
Whither the Center?
 In fact, defining the Congress's political center on Federal spending is really what the struggle is about, as no one seriously expects Mr. Penny's and Mr. Kasich's plan to become law. Even if it passed the House, it would not come before the Senate until Congress returned to session in January, when passions would have cooled. And even if it did pass the Senate, it probably would face a Presidential veto.
Rather, Mr. Penny and Mr. Kasich hope to show enough muscle to force Mr. Clinton into serious bargaining over deeper Federal spending cuts than the White House seems willing to make.
They have allies in Senators Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, and Hank Brown, Republican of Colorado, who have a broadly similar plan for $109 billion in budget cuts ready to offer in the Senate.
And they have a wild card: House members may well feel they can vote for it, and score points back home, without worrying that the White House would actually accept the cuts it proposes.
 
Dramatic Cuts
 And some of the cuts -- in dozens of specific Federal programs -- would be dramatic. Among them are proposals to scale back the Superfund program that cleans up hazardous-waste sites; to end subsidies for public-housing construction in favor of vouchers that would let low-income residents choose their own housing, and to abolish the Energy and Commerce Departments and create in their place a Department of Science.
The plan is intended to cut the Medicare program by $35 billion, partly by raising the hospital deductible for affluent Medicare recipients, to $2,000 from $676, and by raising Medicare premiums for the same recipients. The proposal would also withhold cost-of-living increases on military pensions until retirees reach age 62, and it would raise the retirement age, to 65 from 62, for civilian Federal workers.
Besides arguing that the plan would disrupt the economic recovery and hurt the military, the Administration argues that the cuts would wreck Mr. Clinton's blueprint for health care. The health care proposal would be financed partly by $124 billion taken from the Medicare program that Mr. Penny and Mr. Kasich now seek to pare back.
 
Clinton's Plan
 On Monday, Mr. Penny and Mr. Kasich will offer their proposal as an amendment to Mr. Clinton's own budget-cutting plan, one he promised in August to win conservative Democrats over to his fiscal package.
That plan would cut existing Federal programs by $2 billion and save another $9 billion partly by putting into effect Vice President Al Gore's recommendations on streamlining Federal operations.
Mr. Clinton is in the politically difficult situation of arguing against large cuts in Federal spending. Moreover, his plan's savings look puny beside the Penny-Kasich proposal.
To bulk up his own plan and swing votes away from his rivals' Mr. Clinton said today that he would add another $600 million in spending cuts and try to get Congress to put into law Mr. Gore's plan to gradually reduce the Federal workforce by 252,000 workers. Those actions would boost the White House's total savings to about $30 billion, the Administration said.

HEADLINE: THE PACIFIC SUMMIT;
Mending Images With Pandas and Taking Home 747's

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 19

 BODY:
In another era of Asian diplomacy, American leaders visiting China would always stop in at the home of a Chinese worker, sip tea and painfully follow a scripted conversation about his life at home and work. This time it was President Jiang Zemin's turn, sitting in the loveseat in Cary Qualls split-level house in Marysville, a blue-collar suburb 25 miles north of Seattle.
China's leader came with a giant stuffed panda for the Qualls's 2-year-old son, Gregory, and a doll for Marinda, their 4-year-old daughter. There was Chinese silk for Mr. Qualls's wife, Melanie. And he had a lot of questions about the capitalist life of the 33-year-old mechanic at the Boeing Company, who makes mid-wing stub joints for 747's when he is not entertaining world leaders. 
 Mr. Jiang wanted to know if Boeing owned the house. No, said Mr. Qualls. That led to a discussion about the Qualls's monthly mortgage payments, a new concept in China, and his work schedule. "You have a nice home," Mr. Jiang concluded, surveying the three cars parked in the driveway before speeding off with his entourage of 50.
 
Different Agendas
 These have been days of disparate agendas for the leaders of Asia, each working furiously at image-building and deal-making on their way to meeting President Clinton for the first-ever summit meeting of Asian powers. Mr. Jiang was at the Qualls as part of a carefully orchestrated effort to reform China's image as a repressive regime. He even showed pictures of his grandchildren.
President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines stopped off for Texas barbecue and then dropped by to pick up a 747 for Philippine Airlines. Twirling one of his signature cigars in his suite at the Four Seasons Hotel this afternoon, Mr. Ramos described how he was flying his new toy back home.
"We may be the only ones going back from APEC with something really big," he said, referring to the otherwise dry-as-trade-figures talk that swirled around the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
 
No News Is Good News
 For Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa of Japan, the biggest challenge was to try to make no news at home, particularly news that would threaten his 70 percent approval ratings. Mr. Hosokawa, the Japanese press reported as he left for a 30-hour visit, was coming ready to give in on rice, telling Mr. Clinton that when push came to shove he would finally open a market that Japanese leaders have long feared to breach. No one doubts that agrees with Mr. Hosokawa's own feelings on the issue.
But today, sitting next to President Clinton, he chose his words with utmost precision, mixing English and Japanese to describe the whole question as a "serious no mondai" -- a "serious problem" -- that he could not afford to tackle until he was finished pushing a sweeping political reform bill through the Japanese Parliament.
So did he make his promise or not? Carefully preserving deniability for all in the room, Mr. Hosokawa and Mr. Clinton went off for a private chat, one that the American Ambassador to Japan, Walter F. Mondale, said with obvious relief that he did not witness and so could not discuss.
But Mr. Hosokawa will go home with the one thing he most desperately sought: some more time before he has to get serious about trade problems. "This is a different Government for a different time," Mr. Clinton said this afternoon, taking every chance he could to congratulate Mr. Hosokawa for finally moving to reform a political system whose corruption became a trade barrier in itself.
As soon as that is done, he said, "I believe Mr. Hososkawa will move seriously on the two great economic issues we face," restoring economic growth and moving toward greater opening for investment in Japan.
 
Not Too Casual, Please
 Japan's biggest concern about this week's meetings is that Mr. Clinton will make them too casual. He has already banned assistants and the usual legions of notetakers from his big meeting on Saturday on Blake Island, off the Seattle coast. More than a few ministry bureaucrats are worried their leaders may not be able to sustain hours of serious talk without someone to whisper in their ears.
"Asians don't really feel so comfortable with informal meetings," a senior Japanese diplomat lamented a few days ago. "They feel better if they have to keep their jackets on."
Probably the hardest public relations task of the whole meeting fell to Rafidah Aziz, the Minister of International Trade and Industry of Malaysia. Malaysia has made no secret of the fact it dislikes the whole idea of APEC, which competes with an Asians-and-Asians-only organization that Mohamad Mahathir, the Malaysian Prime Minister, has long advocated.
Mr. Mahathir was the one spoilsport of the event, refusing to take part and quietly urging other leaders in Southeast Asia to do the same. He failed, and at the last minute sent Mrs. Rafidah, who is known for a pithy tongue and a colorful wardrobe.

HEADLINE: Dow Makes Slight Gain In Broad Market Slump

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks were mostly lower yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average the only market indicator posting a gain on the day. The average rose 8.67 points to close at 3,694.01, up 9.50 points for the week. On Tuesday the Dow posted a record high of 3,710.77.
While some of the large capitalization stocks rose, the remainder of the market slumped. Investors, some traders said, were focused on rising interest rates and the state of the economy. 
 Joseph V. Battapaglia, the chief investment strategist for Gruntal & Company, said there were two things to watch in yesterday's market -- bonds, which continued to slip, and the Nasdaq composite, which also continued to weaken.
Also, he noted, "yesterday was an expiration day for options and futures, and the Dow and Standard & Poor's indices were skewed by those closing positions."
 
'A Sloppy Process'
 "Unfortunately, the fundamental change from sliding interest rates to an expanding economy is a sloppy process," Mr. Battapaglia said. "Investors are having trouble dealing with the fact that interest rates are not going any lower and are starting to second-guess if the economy has staying power. This has been the cause of the volatility in the stock market for the past few weeks."
Despite the volatility, Mr. Battapaglia said there were some positive fundamental factors in place. The Producer Price Index and Consumer Price Index numbers were strong recently. The North American Free Trade Agreement was approved despite contentious debate, and the economy is performing strongly as the fourth quarter progresses.
"So, if investors can hold their noses, and keep their eyes closed through this and maintain their positions," he said, "they should be able go into the new year being happy they did so."
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 303 million, down from 313.5 million on Thursday. The number of losing issues was far greater than stocks that showed gains for the day: 1,333 to 795.
 
Price 'Bounce' Expected
 In early trading, blue-chip issues recouped some losses as investors picked the market for buying opportunities based on lower prices.
Market strategists said that while the selloff was not finished, some kind of price "bounce" was due as prices fell, attracting buyers looking for cheaper stocks. And it was bargain hunting that may have kept the blue-chip issues resilient in the face of a sharp drop in bond prices, which caused interest rates to rise abruptly. Bonds had opened lower and then sold off after the United States merchandise trade deficit came in at an unexpectedly high $10.89 billion.
Elsewhere in the market, Talbots, the specialty retailer of women's apparel was up 16 percent from its initial public offering price during the first day of trading, closing at 22 5/8. The company sold 11 million shares and made the top of the most active list yesterday, as 6.8 million shares changed hands.
 
Airline Stocks Weak
 Airline stocks were weaker on news of the strike by flight attendants at American Airlines and the restructuring of United Airlines. AMR, the parent of American, was down 3/4, to 68 1/4, while UAL, the parent of United, was unchanged at 140.
The Pep Boys -- Manny Moe & Jack gained 1/2, to 24 1/8, as the auto parts retailer's third-quarter earnings reached 28 cents a share, compared with 24 cents for the comparable period a year ago. A consensus of 19 analysts surveyed by the Institutional Brokers Estimate System was for 27 cents a share.
On the first full trading session after the North American Free Trade agreement was approved, the expected excitement in trading on the Mexican stock exchange did not materialize. It closed only nine-tenth of a percent higher, or 19.48 points, to 2,185.66.
Stock prices ended lower in Tokyo yesterday, with the benchmark Nikkei index closing below 18,000 for the first time since March 16. The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 225.13 points, or 1.24 percent, to 17,941.19.

HEADLINE: Ski Merger May Perk Up Aspen

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EVERGREEN, Colo., Nov. 19

 BODY:
For years, Aspen has been celebrated as much for celebrities like The Donald and The Ivana, as for, well, The Snow.
Now the area's two skiing companies plan to merge, which may again put snow at the forefront in Aspen at a time when the nation's $2.5 billion ski industry has finally recovered from a recession. 
 For skiers, the merger may mean better ski facilities and more skiing at four mountains, instead of three, with a single lift ticket. For Aspen residents, the merger may mean more jobs and a greater emphasis on being a resort for serious skiers. It also may mean more traffic congestion and even more high-priced housing.
 
 
A Tangled Tale
 But first a tangled tale must be at least partly resolved next week, which is the start of the ski season in Aspen. The tale involves a California billionaire, a Chicago billionaire, a mere millionaire from Texas, and Harvard University. It also involves the five commissioners of Pitkin County, which includes Aspen, whose approval is indirectly key to the merger.
If the two companies merge, the combination would control the $42 million ski business in Aspen, the nation's fifth-largest ski resort. Vail, Colo., is the largest.
The companies are the Aspen Skiing Company, owned by the Crown family of Chicago, and its far smaller unprofitable rival a few miles away, the Aspen Highlands Ski Area, owned by the trustees of Harvard University.
Gerald Hines, a soft-spoken real estate millionaire from Houston, now has an option to buy the Highlands, as it is known, from Harvard, reportedly for more than $20 million. The Indiana native is one of the most prolific developers of office buildings in the country and is known for showplaces like Pennzoil Place in downtown Houston.
 
 
County Approval
 Mr. Hines must first get approval from the Pitkin County commissioners for an ambitious redevelopment plan involving the construction of a shopping mall, ice rink, an amphitheater, and more than 50 condominiums and houses -- the largest such project in Aspen's history.
Mr. Hines's project, which would be at the base of the Highlands, will make little sense as a real estate development unless he also owns the Highlands. His option to buy the Highlands from Harvard expires Monday, and if he exercises it he will be gambling that he will get the county commission's approval in January for his plan.
The Highlands, combined with the redevelopment project, will be even more valuable when it is merged with the larger Aspen Skiing. Aspen Skiing officials say they are certain of the county commission's approval, but an earlier negative vote by an agency making recommendations to the commission indicates that approval is far from certain. Mr. Hines would only say he plans to "wait and find out."
However, it is highly unlikely the Highlands-Aspen Skiing merger would go through without Mr. Hines winning approval for his plan from the county commission.
The commissioners themselves would not comment, except to say they would meet in January on this issue. However, Jody Edwards, a county official who reviewed Mr. Hines's plan for the commissioners, said that Mr. Hines's project was so huge that it would block "the views of the mountains with second homes that are vacant most of the year."
Moreover, Michael Conviser, a member of the Maroon-Castle Creek Caucus, a neighborhood advocacy group, said Mr. Hines's plan would "destroy the Aspen Growth Management Plan," a 20-year-old government plan to restrain real estate development that might damage the environment.
 
 
A 'Sweetheart'
 Still, Mr. Conviser describes Mr. Hines as 'a sweetheart" whose developments are quality projects and who might yet develop a plan that would satisfy the county's objections.
By far, the king of the mountain in Aspen is Aspen Skiing, founded in 1946. It controls three of the valley's four skiing mountains -- Aspen Mountain, Snowmass and Buttermilk -- and two hotels, Little Nell and Snowmass Club. It is the community's largest employer, with 2,250 workers during peak season. More than half of the town's revenues are generated during the five-month ski season.
Aspen Skiing has annual revenue of $40 million, compared with $2 million to $3 million for the Highlands, which controls the Aspen Highlands Mountain. The revenue figures come from I. William Berry, executive editor of the Ski Industry Letter in Katonah, N.Y. Aspen Skiing declines to confirm the numbers.
Aspen Skiing controls operations at its three ski mountains and received almost 1.4 million skiers last winter. The company's skier visits grew by 6.9 percent last year, comfortably ahead of key Colorado rivals like Vail and Telluride.
Under the ownership of Marvin Davis, the Los Angeles oil billionaire who bought Aspen Skiing along with 20th Century Fox in 1981, Aspen Skiing helped foster the resort's image as a refuge for the pampered rich and famous.
 
 
Crown Family
 But seven months ago, Mr. Davis sold his half of Aspen Skiing to his partners, the Crown family, whose fortune is based on real estate and a substantial stock holding in General Dynamics, the big military contractor.
While Lester Crown, the 68-year-old patriarch of the family, said at first that the family would keep 100 percent of Aspen Skiing, it now plans to sell a stake to Mr. Hines if the Houston developer can win the Highlands. The potential stake is reportedly 10 to 15 percent, but Mr. Hines would not disclose details.
Aspen Skiing's rival, the Highlands, was founded in 1958 by Whipple Van Ness Jones, an eccentric businessman and an Aspen resident. "The Highlands is the only operating ski lift museum in the world," jokes Rick Jones, who operated the ski area for six years and is now a ski consultant. Rick Jones, the estranged grandson of Whip Jones, said the Highlands had been losing about $500,000 a year for the last decade.
When the Highlands started, it appeared to pose a threat to Aspen Skiing. Even as the Highlands became less competitive because of obsolete equipment, feuding between the two companies increased.
 
 
$11.4 Million Judgment
 The situation worsened when the elder Mr. Jones filed a restraint-of-trade suit against Aspen Skiing in the early 1980's, contending that the company was trying to drive him out of business. Mr. Jones won an $11.4 million judgment after the case went all the way to the United States Supreme Court, which sustained the award. The suit was filed against previous owners of Aspen Skiing but was settled by the Crown family and Mr. Davis.
A 1932 Harvard alumnus, Whip Jones last year donated the Highlands to Harvard as a gift in a charitable trust. He refers questions about the Highlands to Harvard officials.
The Highlands is "the best ski mountain in the area," said Mr. Berry of the Ski Industry Letter. "The Aspen Skiing Company has the chance to turn it into the fine ski area it should have been all these years," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Trade Deficit Rose 8.3% In September, to $10.9 Billion

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
A widening trade gap with Japan and China and a rare shortfall with Mexico swelled the American trade deficit with the rest of the world by 8.3 percent in September, the Government said today.
A recovering American economy drew record imports of $49.8 billion, up 3.4 percent from a month earlier. Exports rose only 2.1 percent, to $38.8 billion, the Commerce Department said. The combination produced a monthly deficit of $10.9 billion. 
 So far this year, the trade gap is running at an annual rate of $117.3 billion, a substantial deterioration from the $84.5 billion last year and the worst since 1988, when it was $118.5 billion.
"The United States continues to heavily buy imports," reflecting a pickup in the American economy, said Allen Sinai, an economist with Economic Advisers Inc. "Meanwhile, still-stagnant economies around the world are hurting our exports."
Trade was one of the few areas of strength in the economy during the 1990-91 recession; now it is hurting growth and is not expected to improve until late next year or 1995. Slumps in Europe and Japan have cut into export sales while Americans enjoying an economic upturn have increasingly bought more foreign goods.
The report came as President Clinton met with Asian leaders in Seattle to promote expanded trade and only two days after the House approved the North American Free Trade Agreement on promises that it would increase exports to Mexico.
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said in Seattle that the latest trade figures and the deficits with Japan and China spoke "directly to the reasons why we are meeting with our Pacific trading partners."
The September deficit with Japan was $5.3 billion, the worst since April; with China, $2.5 billion, and with all Pacific Rim countries, $8.5 billion.
The United States recorded a $101 million deficit with Mexico in September, the first since March 1991 and the worst since December 1990. That whittled the year-to-date American surplus with Mexico to $1.75 billion, compared with $4.4 billion for the corresponding period a year ago.
Bruce Steinberg, a Merrill Lynch economist, said the Mexican economy had slowed this year because of uncertainty over the trade agreement's passage and the Mexican Government's anti-inflation program. Now, he said, "Mexico's economy is likely to accelerate and the U.S. trade balance should go back into surplus fairly soon."
The deficit with Canada nearly doubled, to $1.1 billion, bringing the year-to-date gap to $7.7 billion, up from $5 billion for the first nine months of 1992. The deficit with Western Europe was $395 million in September and $315 million so far this year. Last year at this time the United States had a $7.2 billion year-to-date surplus with Europe.
The gain in imports in September reflected increases of $216 million in autos and auto parts and $192 million in crude oil. Imports also rose substantially for other petroleum products, iron and steel, computer accessories, civilian aircraft and jewelry.
Exports were bolstered by gains of $476 million in gold, $378 million in food and $124 million in telecommunications equipment, but civilian aircraft exports slumped $376 million.
The year-to-date deficit with Japan is $42.2 billion, larger than with any other country and up from $34.9 billion for the corresponding period last year. The second-worst deficit was with China, $16.7 billion for the year so far, up from $13.5 billion a year ago.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Drop Sharply; Is the Rally Over?

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The rally in the bond market, which has carried long-term interest rates to their lowest level in 25 years, may be over. Such a turn in the market would send home-mortgage rates higher and could make the stock market, already at its own record levels, jittery.
Such a declaration is risky, mainly because of the economy's erratic performance in the last several years. But at least that seemed to be the view yesterday as bond dealers sold and sold as if they were running for the exits. The yield on the 30-year bond rose as high as 6.36 percent, the highest level in more than three months. 
 The rest of the market also slumped as prices fell sharply across the board and yields rose. Fear of stronger economic growth at the end of this year, concern about inflation and worry that the Federal Reserve could move soon to raise short-term rates all played a role in the selloff.
Money managers are also selling to lock in nice profits for the year. And, most important now, the mood of the market is turning grim; even minor data that simply reaffirm what everyone seems to know -- that the economy is growing a little faster -- have become another reason to sell.
The selloff has sharpened the debate between those who think the rally is over and those argue that the decline in long-term rates will resume because the economy will grow at just a moderate pace next year while inflation remains in check.
"I don't see the case to say that we can set new lows on interest rates," said Nicholas Sargen, the chief investment officer at Prudential's Global Advisers, a global bond fund. "Even the old low of 5.75 percent -- that looks distant now."
John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers, takes the other view. "I don't want to say the rally is over," he said. "If we are right on the fundamentals, the U.S. is likely to go through 1994 -- the fourth year of an expansion -- without accelerating inflation, and that would be a positive surprise for the bond market."
What makes choosing sides difficult is that the outlooks are not very different. Both camps expect moderate growth next year at a slower pace than the 4 percent rate now expected in the fourth quarter. They both expect inflation, running at less than 3 percent this year, to remain in check.
Mr. Sargen, however, argues that inflation has to go even lower to get long-term interest rates to new lows. Mr. Lipsky expects that stable inflation with steady growth of about 3 percent will be enough to assure investors that inflation is not on the rise and enough of a "surprise" to push rates lower.
 
 
Trading Range Is Broken
 But for the near-term, that debate seems to make no difference any longer. The jump of the 30-year bond's yield to above 6.25 percent yesterday has already smashed the ceiling of the trading range that many optimists had been betting on.
"I did not expect this kind of selloff," said John R. Williams, managing director of global market economics at Bankers Trust and another analyst who still expects interest rates to resume their decline.
Mr. Sargen sold a lot of his United States bonds Thursday after it appeared that the market would not get a lift from the House's approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement. "You don't fight the tape," he said, referring to the wave of selling that has swamped the market. Expressing a view of many money managers that could actually accelerate the selloff, he added: "You move to the sidelines until the dust settles. The selloff may be overdone, but you can't be confident that the correction is over yet."
In trading in the secondary market around 5 P.M., the price of the 6.25 percent 30-year bond was off 16/32 point. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, was at 6.33 percent, up from 6.24 percent Thursday. Earlier, the bond had been off more than a point and a half with the yield at 6.36 percent.
Three weeks ago, the yield on the 30-year bond was at 5.96 percent. Its 25-year low was 5.78 percent on Oct. 15.
 
 
Fears of Fed Action
 The yield on the two-year note jumped to 4.20 percent, from 4.13 percent the day before. This and other short-term rates are being driven higher by fears that the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank, will be forced by the stronger growth to raise its short-term interest-rate target above 3 percent, where it has been for more than a year.
This fear of a move by the Fed seemed to be heightened this week by a report released Thursday by the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which predicted that the Fed would soon have to push its 3 percent interest rate target higher.
In the last three weeks, the yield on the two-year note has jumped from 4.01 percent. Its low for the year was 3.69 percent on Sept. 3.
The selling yesterday was not really touched off by any one event, but was more of a continuation of the downward trend. Some traders said the report on the trade deficit, which showed imports were increasing, was a cause. But like other recent data, it was just confirming what most analysts seemed to agree on already: that the economy will grow at an annual rate of about 4 percent in the last four months of the year.
The question now is what happens next year, but there will not even be many hints until well into January, which means the selling -- and, for certain, the volatility -- will continue.

Lego Picks California Site for Theme Park

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CARLSBAD, Calif., Nov. 19

 BODY:
The maker of Lego plastic blocks plans to build an amusement park for children in this Southern California coastal town.
The Lego Group, the Danish company that makes the popular toy, said today that the Lego Family Park would feature miniature buildings and other creations made of Legos, the multicolored, interlocking plastic blocks. There will also be amusement park rides for young children.
 
 This will be the Danish company's second amusement park. Lego World, the family entertainment subsidiary of the Lego Group, opened Legoland Park in Billund, Denmark, in 1968.
The company, which had narrowed the potential sites for an American park to Carlsbad and Prince William County, Va., said it had chosen Carlsbad, about 30 miles north of San Diego, because of its favorable demographics and weather.
A spokesman for Lego said a recent decision by the Walt Disney Company to build an amusement park with an American history theme in Prince William County was not a factor in picking Carlsbad.
 
'Great News,' Governor Says
 Gov. Pete Wilson of California called the decision "great news" for the state, which is mired in a deep recession.
The Governor's office said the project was expected to generate annual economic benefits of about $76 million to the Carlsbad area. Construction of the park is expected to create about 800 jobs and $185 million in new investment, Governor Wilson's office said.
The 37-acre park, aimed at children aged 2 to 13 and their families, is to open in 1999. Construction is to begin in 1995, after an 18-month approval process, the spokesman said.
The park is being built on a vacant 424-acre site. In addition to the 37 acres required for the initial park phase, Lego will have 43 acres for roads, setbacks and parking, 28 acres for future expansion and 5 acres for support services.
Master plans by the Carltas Company, which owns the site, include a 700-room resort hotel and golf course, to be developed by Pointe International and Gosnell Builders, and a 38-acre biotechnology office park. Seventy-eight acres of flower fields at the site will be left untouched.
Lego, which is privately held, expects the year-round park to employ about 700 full- and part-time workers and attract about 1.8 million visitors in its first year.

Dollar Rallies and Ends Day Up Against Yen and Mark

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
The dollar rallied against most currencies yesterday, rising against the yen amid expectation of steps by Japan to stimulate its economy and cut its trade surplus with the United States.
An increase in American interest rates helped lift the dollar to a 14-week high against the German mark. 
 In New York trading, the dollar jumped to 108.45 yen, from 107.35 on Thursday. It also rose to 1.7192 marks, its highest level since Aug. 13, before finishing at 1.7148 marks, up from 1.7130 on Thursday.
Gold prices rose. Gold for December delivery gained $1.60, to $378.30 an ounce, on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
Traders bought dollars for yen, betting that Tokyo would take steps to jolt the country's slumping economy, thus spurring demand for American goods. Many expect Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to announce an income-tax cut while he is at the Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Seattle.
 
High Expectations for U.S.
 "People think the U.S. will get what it wants -- free trade and economic stimulus in Japan," said David De Rosa, director of foreign-exchange trading at the Swiss Bank Corporation. Without some action by the Japanese, American officials could start calling for a stronger yen again, he said.
Yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit rose 8.3 percent in September, to $10.9 billion, partly because of a $5.3 billion deficit with Japan.
Signs of strength in the American economy and rising interest rates sent the dollar higher against the mark yesterday, said John Hardy, managing director at Intercap Investments, which manages $20 million in a currency-trading fund. The 30-year Treasury bond surged to 6.33 percent, from 6.24 percent on Thursday.
Higher rates make dollar-denominated deposits more attractive.
Many traders expect Germany's Bundesbank to cut interest rates again before the end of the year to spur economic growth. Germany's central bank last cut interest rates on Oct. 21, when it lowered its key discount rate to 5.75 percent from 6.25 percent and cut the Lombard rate to 6.75 percent from 7.25 percent.
The British pound fell to $1.4732 in late New York trading, from $1.4785 on Thursday.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Beware the Odd Twists In Foreign Investments

BYLINE: By Francis Flaherty

 BODY:
AS more and more Americans invest abroad, there is something they should know: Kansas it's not.
Foreign markets are not as odd as Oz, of course. But in seeking profits from free trade agreements or Communism's eclipse, investors will encounter issues they need not worry about at home. 
 Currency is one. "Currency fluctuations increase the volatility of international stocks," said George D. Kinder, a financial adviser in Cambridge, Mass. "Take a foreign stock that may range between a 20 percent loss and a 20 percent gain. If the likely currency fluctuation is 5 percent either way, then the stock really has a 25 percent range on both sides."
This currency twist can enhance -- or derail -- stock performance. For the year ended in August, Tokyo's Nikkei index rose 16 percent, and the yen gained 21 percent against the dollar, yielding a combined 40 percent gain for American investors. But the London market's 32 percent jump in the period turned into just a tiny hop for Americans. The reason: the dollar rose 24 percent against the pound.
Many people ignore currency swings, but now may be the time to pay attention, said James B. Stack of Investech Research in Whitefish, Mont. With America's rebounding interest rates and low inflation, he said, "it's tough to see the dollar going anywhere but up against European currency over the next 12 to 18 months." However buoyant the European markets, such a swing might deep-six an American's profits.
Hedges can tame the currency risk, but they may not work, warned Brian S. Mattes, a vice president of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds. He suggested holding for the long term and diversifying.
"Economy correlations" is something else Auntie Em did not worry about, but international investors should. The markets of some countries move in tandem, some in opposite ways, and some follow no pattern. Generally, the larger economies have positive correlations with one another and zero to slightly negative correlations with emerging markets like India, Thailand and Greece.
By taking a stake in economies that are only loosely related, investors can lower their risk. With a position in emerging markets, for instance, an investor gets a hedge against trouble in his American portfolio. Campbell R. Harvey, an associate professor of finance at Duke University, is high on emerging markets anyway, but the hedging role heightens their value.
Even a stock mix in closely connected economies can soften market declines. When the United States market dropped about 20 years ago, Mr. Kinder said, an American investor could have cut his losses by a third if he had placed 25 percent of his portfolio in Japan and 25 percent in Canada. One reason: Canada's oil reserves cushioned the stock market there from "oil shocks."
Some conditions in foreign markets -- lackadaisical regulation, great price swings, political instability -- might cause a commotion in Topeka. Domestic investors who blanch at news of a mere corporate reorganization may want to stay home upon hearing Mr. Kinder's worries. "I'm heavily invested in Asia and excited," he said, "but the growing military in China concerns me a little."
Such risks add an exclamation point to that standard investment rule: Diversify! "People will read that Argentina's doing real well and invest a lot there," Professor Harvey said. But one-country investors "can lose their shirts," he warned. "Invest in a basket of countries."
Diversify in other ways, too. Select mutual funds that focus on different industries and different size companies, and that practice different investment philosophies.
"Find funds that hedge," Mr. Kinder said. "Use small-cap funds to enhance the rate of return, and use value funds to minimize price swings."
As in all money matters, the most important question is: How much? What part of a portfolio should be foreign? "The conventional wisdom was 10 to 20 percent," Mr. Kinder said. "But that range is moving up," to 20 percent to 25 percent, he said.
Whatever the recommendation, Americans are homebody investors. Sophisticated pension funds invest only 5 percent to 10 percent in foreign equities, and individuals far less.
Thinking more globally than most, Professor Harvey uses world stock value as a guide. For instance, with emerging markets representing $900 billion -- or nearly 10 percent -- of the world's $10 trillion in stock, he recommends giving them 6 percent to 20 percent of a portfolio.
This world-equity idea may explain past investment patterns. "International investment was an afterthought for Americans 20 years ago -- and with good reason," Professor Harvey said. "The U.S. share of world capitalization was peaking then at about two-thirds."
If world stock is the guide, what would a portfolio look like today? At September's end, the United States had 37 percent of world equity, Japan and the rest of Asia 35 percent and Europe most of the balance.

HEADLINE: Short Sales Outstanding Increase 3.7%, to a Record

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Rising stock market volume and volatile price movements were encouraging signs to investors who sold shares short last month.
Those conditions helped the number of shares sold short and not yet covered to rise 3.7 percent on the New York Stock Exchange, to a record 1.23 billion shares in the month that ended on Nov. 5, according to Big Board figures released yesterday. In September, the number of shares sold short fell for the first time this year. 
 On the American Stock Exchange, short interest also moved higher in the month that ended on Nov. 5, rising 1.7 percent, to 100.46 million shares. The total is the second highest on record at the exchange, surpassed only by the 104.5 million shares sold short in August.
 
 
Bets That Prices Will Fall
 Short-sellers borrow shares and sell them. Much of the heavy short-selling reflects bets that share prices will decline, enabling the seller to repurchase the shares at a lower price, repay the lender and pocket the difference.
"I was surprised that shorts had decreased positions" in the previous month, said Michael Ingraham, a vice president for investment analytical services at Alex. Brown & Sons in Baltimore. "I see this as a recovery and that now we are basically back on trend."
Rising interest rates and year-end profit taking have been pushing broad market averages lower in recent weeks, even as narrower measures like the Dow Jones industrial average have marched steadily higher. The volatility and the price decline are encouraging developments for short-sellers, who for the most part have had a dismal year as stock markets have risen to record highs.
 
 
Tool for Speculators
 In addition to betting on a decline in prices, short-selling is used to speculate on the success of a merger involving stock swaps.
To lock in a profit, arbitragers buy stock in the company being acquired and sell the acquiring company short.
Speculators have been using that technique with shares of Merck & Company, which on Thursday completed its takeover of Medco Containment Services Inc..
Since the deal was announced on July 28, short interest in Merck has surged. With more than 34 million shares sold short, Merck was the single largest short for the month.
After waning last month, bearish sentiment about RJR Nabisco snapped back strongly. The number of RJR shares sold short in the period nearly doubled, to 14.6 million.

HEADLINE: Neutral Stance by Fed Panel

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 19

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve maintained its policy of keeping interest rates steady at a Sept. 21 meeting of Fed policy makers, according to minutes of the meeting released today.
The Fed's Open Market Committee shifted to a neutral stance at a meeting on Aug. 17, abandoning its previous tilt in favor of raising interest rates to restrain inflation. 
 In deciding to keep interest rates steady at the September meeting, the Fed was responding to reports that showed inflation remained low after a bout of higher prices in January, February and April.
In its most recent report on inflation, the Government said consumer prices rose four-tenths of 1 percent in October, with increases of five-tenths or more in several major sectors.
At the September meeting, the Fed committee voted unanimously "to maintain the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions," the minutes said, citing a slower pace of consumer inflation and a decline in producer prices.
The minutes of each meeting are kept secret until after the committee holds its next meeting. The panel last met Tuesday, and analysts have speculated that the group again favored holding interest rates steady.
Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the House Banking Committee, wants the Fed to change procedures and announce the committee policy decisions shortly after each meeting.
According to the September minutes, panel members were confident that inflation would remain under control through the fall months. But beyond mid-November, they said, it was difficult to determine what moves they might have to take on interest rates.

HEADLINE: MORTGAGES;
Owners Offer Financing For Hard-to-Sell Homes

BYLINE: By Nick Ravo

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH housing sales have picked up and mortgages are available at enticingly low rates, vacation homes and hard-to-sell properties sometimes are easier to sell if their owners provide the financing. In part, that is because home lenders are reluctant to make new mortgages on some co-op apartments, condominiums and waterfront houses.
Caveats abound about seller-financing, sometimes referred to as taking back a mortgage or making a private mortgage. Real estate lawyers urge homeowners considering such a deal to assess the risks. 
 "First and foremost, the seller has to be sure that the buyer has the income stream to support the mortgage payments," said Angelo A. Mastrangelo, a lawyer in Rosedale, N.J. "They have to do the income and credit checks."
The seller must also make sure the sale price is in line with the appraised value of the home and the loan-to-value ratio is no more than 90 percent. "You want to be sure that the buyer puts some money in, so he doesn't take a walk," Mr. Mastrangelo said.
The buyer makes a down payment and monthly payments at an agreed-upon interest rate directly to the seller, not to a bank. Generally, the loan is for no more than five years, with the buyer expected to obtain other financing at the end of the term.
In many cases, financing a sale is an alternative to renting out a home that is difficult to sell. It works best for owners who do not need the proceeds to buy another home.
For some buyers, the technique is a way to buy a home when traditional lenders refuse to make a loan on the property. Other buyers may fail to qualify for a market-rate mortgage because they cannot make a sufficient down payment.
Sometimes, an owner finances all or part of a down payment, and the buyer takes out a traditional mortgage for the remainder. "It's supplemental," said William Selsberg, a lawyer in Stamford, Conn.
Mr. Mastrangelo warned that should a buyer default, the seller might have to take back the home and assume the payments.
He added that the buyer and the seller needed separate lawyers for the paperwork. Seller-financing, however, speeds up the closing process and eliminates expenses like points, the fees often charged by banks. Each point is equivalent to a percentage point of the loan.
Seller-financing was popular in the late 1970's and early 80's when high interest rates and house prices made mortgages difficult to get for some people. It was used less as interest rates declined.
In the early 90's, when homes became difficult to sell and banks were reluctant to lend, more sellers provided their own financing. With most lenders offering low rates today, seller-financing is generally provided for second homes and vacation homes.
"Someplace like Martha's Vineyard with a lot of properties on the market, lenders are leery," said Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a Washington trade group.
Mr. Mastrangelo added, "If you own a vacation home, and you want to get top dollar for it, you should be prepared to use seller-financing because lenders are less likely to lend on those kind of properties."
Seller-financing is also common in the co-op market in New York, particularly for units of less than 600 square feet or for units in buildings that are less than 51 percent occupied by their owners. Many banks are reluctant to lend on these units, which have fallen in price over the last five years.
Similar problems plague condominiums in many areas. "There are lots of places where condos used to be worth a lot of money and have since taken a lot of decline in value," said Keith T. Gumbinger, an analyst for HSH Associates, a mortgage research company in Butler, N.J.

HEADLINE: Democracy Struggles in Africa;
Back to the Generals in Nigeria

 BODY:
The latest military coup in Nigeria is a cruel setback for democracy in Africa's most populous country and one of its richest. Thirty years ago Nigeria was among Africa's proudest political pioneers. Today it has become a stumbling laggard, mired in old-fashioned military rule while other parts of the continent move, however haltingly, toward democratic renewal.
The United States and Britain are right to condemn the coup and to consider further tightening the sanctions they imposed in June, when elections were abruptly canceled. Still, the main burden of continued struggle for democracy will fall on ordinary Nigerians who, like so many other Africans, are thoroughly fed up with strongman rule. 
 The old canard about Africans' supposed indifference to "Western-style" democratic systems has been disproved time and again in the past few years. From Benin to Zambia, people have demonstrated in the streets, walked off their jobs and otherwise risked their lives and livelihoods to demand multiparty elections.
Unfortunately, getting to election day has been only half the struggle. Many of the continent's dictatorships have tenaciously clung to power even after they have been voted out, or have sought to reimpose their grip by force before elected governments had a chance to consolidate themselves.
In June, Nigeria experienced the first kind of reversal. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida blocked the apparent electoral victory of Moshood Abiola. After massive protests, General Babangida stepped down and named a civilian, Ernest Shonekan, as Interim President. But Mr. Shonekan never convinced Nigerians he was more than a military puppet.
Now the civilian facade has been ripped away by Gen. Sani Abacha, a long-time military conspirator with a reputation for corruption. General Abacha's first moves ominously included abolishing all political parties, banning strikes and political gatherings and dissolving local civilian administrations.
Politics in Nigeria has long been troubled by jealousies among the country's three main ethnic groups -- the Hausa-Fulani from the north, the Yoruba from the southwest and the Ibo from the east. Mr. Abiola, a Yoruba, fell victim, in part, to these tensions. Although he won a national majority at the polls, he proved unacceptable to powerful sections of the Hausa-Fulani military elite.
But while electoral politics seemed headed toward a promising transcendence of ethnic divisions, the military now appears to have divided the nation anew. It has also divided itself, as generals fiercely compete for power and its profits. While these military rivalries may give civilians a new opening, they also heighten the risk of civil war.
Meanwhile, in one form or another, the struggle for democracy is sure to go on. History and continental trends are on the democrats' side. The United States should do all it can in their behalf.

Easy On That Cucumber

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
When history honors the role played by victuals in the annals of the Great Republic, let it be recorded that it was the fruit-and-veggie bloc that saved the White House's bacon when the North American Free Trade Agreement was in jeopardy at the Capitol.
To say that the President bought a victory with oranges, tomatoes and cucumbers would be unkind to the Congressfolk of the garden and sunshine states. Mr. Clinton had predicted that many patriotic Congresspersons would bravely risk their political careers "to do what they think is right." 
 Justice compels us to concede that risking their political careers may have been what the fruit-and-veggie bloc were doing when they told the White House it could stick free trade in its ear unless tomatoes, cucumbers and Florida orange juice were protected from foreign competition.
The prima-facie evidence, however, suggests they were less interested in doing what was right for the republic than in doing what was right for businesses that flourish in their districts, or to put it in plainer English, for themselves.
Having been told for years by demographers and political analysts that the American farmer is as gone as the horse collar, I was astonished to learn from this event that it ain't so. The tomato farmer and the cucumber grower not only live, they also have power to make Congressmen force the President to excuse them from enjoying the blessings of free trade.
A cucumber lobby: Who would have guessed it? Could it have been founded by Representative J.J. (Jake) Pickle of Texas?
Not to be outdone in the grocery political competition, beef and wheat were also granted boons by the President. Representatives from wheat-producing areas and cattle zones had seemed strangely indifferent to statements that North American free trade would produce economic marvels.
Could it have been a rare case of Congressional unselfishness? Perhaps beef and wheat people were willing to sacrifice the benefits free trade would bring their constituents rather than vote against their colleagues in organized labor, who feared free trade would finish them off.
Not so, as it turned out. Beef and wheat were merely waiting for Mr. Clinton to assure them that if they would just vote for free trade he would help them avoid having to compete with other nations' freely traded wheat and beef.
And so the grocery coalition -- fruit and veg, beef and spaghetti -- was instrumental in giving Mr. Clinton his free-trade agreement. There is nothing remarkable about such bartering and buying of votes when a President wants something as desperately as Mr. Clinton wants the free-trade agreement.
In close-run fights the politician who holds out until the last moment often may walk away with so much Federal gravy that he will need a tank train to get it all out of Washington. The present fight, for instance, has been garnished with news that one Texas vote may cost the Treasury $1.4 billion for construction of airplanes the Pentagon doesn't want.
The public usually pays the final bill for these exercises, but an amazing exception occurred during the fight for the first Reagan tax cut in 1981. Then Democrats decided not to fight the big Reagan cuts; instead, they started competing with Republicans to make them even bigger.
Events rarely turn out so happily for the public, though Mr. Clinton keeps assuring us that we will all bless the day free trade comes to North America. Organized labor's disagreement is based on its rust-belt experience with industries that go abroad for cheap labor, leaving ruin and unemployment behind.
Mr. Clinton's prediction that North American free trade will invigorate the economy is the only reason he has given labor to love him. Concessions went to the grocery bloc, but not to the rust belt. Ironically, those concessions may result in raising grocery prices slightly for struggling rust-belt workers before the great economic revival begins.
After showing he can get along without Jesse Jackson, the President has now shown he can get along without organized labor. With this rough treatment of old populist elements of the Democratic Party, those who think something new is in the wind now hail him as "a new Democrat." What is that? Seems a little like an old Republican.

THE RISE OF RUSSIA AND THE FALL OF THE SOVIET EMPIRE
By John B. Dunlop.
360 pp. Princeton, N.J.:
Princeton University Press. $29.95. 
 IT has been only two years and a few months since President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic and his band of loyal democrats defied a coup d'etat, bringing down the Communist Party and, in due course, the Soviet state. Given the extraordinary speed of events in Russia these days, all that seems like old history now. The democrats, once the plucky underdogs, have since become the country's rulers, fallible, corruptible and given to falling out among themselves in spectacular fashion. Mr. Yeltsin, who stood atop a tank in defiance of the hard-line Communists, has now used tanks to finish off his opponents -- all of them former allies in the Russian Parliament that in May 1990 first elected him to lead the then-Soviet republic.
In short, the Russian story has grown more complicated in the last few years, a far cry from the battles of white hats and black hats that had the world riveted in the climactic years 1986-91. Back then, there was a sense -- conveyed in John B. Dunlop's detailed account of the period, "The Rise of Russia and the Fall of the Soviet Empire" -- that once the democrats prevailed, Russia would be free to achieve the twin goals of the anti-Communist movement, democracy and a market economy.
Instead, two years later, the country is still groping its way toward those goals, dodging obstacles that then were only faint outlines on the horizon. By early 1993, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, quoted by Mr. Dunlop in his epilogue, was writing: "A new age has clearly begun, both for Russia and for the whole world. Russia lies utterly ravaged and poisoned; its people are in a state of unprecedented humiliation, and are on the brink of perishing physically, perhaps even biologically."
Mr. Dunlop, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, tells the story of how Mr. Yeltsin skillfully played the "Russian card" in his struggle against Mikhail S. Gorbachev, harnessing his ambitions to the rise of a new Russia while avoiding the nasty trap of Russian nationalism. Mr. Dunlop describes as well the debates over Russia's confused national identity among "Westernizers" (who want Russia to be a "normal" country and join the "civilized" world), statists (who argue that Russia should be more assertive about upholding its unique historical and geographical interests) and hard-core nationalist Bolsheviks (who yearn for a return of the Soviet empire, recast as Great Russia).
These portraits -- some of them inevitably outdated -- are interspersed with an exhaustive account of Russia's recent history, including a close and provocative look at the August 1991 coup. It is Mr. Dunlop's contention that the coup almost succeeded -- and that, in fact, the storming of the White House, or Parliament building, by troops under the command of hard-line Communists had actually begun in the early morning hours of Aug. 21. The author also raises perplexing questions about Mr. Gorbachev's role in the coup, particularly on the final day when the plotters flew down to the Crimea to meet him at his holiday dacha.
But for all the details, there is a strange flatness about the tale as Mr. Dunlop tells it. For one thing, his sources are almost all secondary. Except for two trips to the Soviet Union, one in 1987 and another in 1989, and occasional conversations with leading Russian political figures when they traveled to the West, Mr. Dunlop relies on the Russian (and to some extent the Western) press for his reporting.
Those sources are certainly ample -- and with his scholar's instinct, Mr. Dunlop makes good use of them. But without an author's own eyes and ears to serve as a guide, the result is in places an awkward, stiff and even random compendium of useful facts, rather than an interpretive narrative that could advance our understanding of the vast changes taking place in Russia.

Out of Control

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
Under a cartoon of a man in underpants with a drink in hand racing along a tropical beach, The Economist headlined, "Don't you just love being out of control?" The cartoon character in the London-based magazine represented the recently privatized British utilities, freed from government's heavy hand, but the phrase is the latest extension of the psychological cliche of the year.
To be in control, as in "As of now, I am in control here in the White House," a phrase used in 1981 by Secretary of State Alexander Haig when Ronald Reagan was wounded, is to be boss. To have a blaze under control is what every firefighter hopes to announce. To be beyond control, as in "circumstances beyond my individual control," was a cop-out first used by Mr. Micawber in Charles Dickens's novel "David Copperfield." But to be out of control is to be damnably difficult in every field of endeavor. 
 Students are susceptible: "The campus is out of control," declared a Republican Assemblyman in 1969, as students rioted at the Berkeley campus of the University of California. Workers, too: a year later, the railroad union leader William Winpisinger testified that workers were "running right on the ragged edge of being out of control." And deficits lend themselves to the phrase: Representative Barber B. Conable Jr. of New York worried in 1981 about "keeping the budget deficit from getting out of control." A copywriter for Hefty lawn bags noted the phrase's power: "Lawn out of control? Better get a Hefty."
The familiar phrase lends itself to use as a compound modifier: An editorial in The New York Times in 1990 commented on a bill by the Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, "to put a lid on out-of-control campaign spending." In a recent TV Guide profile of the actress Loni Anderson, its writer, Mary Murphy, asked, "What about the stories branding Loni as a mercenary, an out-of-control shopper?" (A friend denied that, but only made things worse with "Once we went shopping for 12 hours and came back with nothing.")
The phrase was popularized by psychiatry. "The ego is in charge of feelings, actions and perceptions," explains Dr. E. Michael Ehlers of Bethesda, Md. "Out of control refers to any sort of ego failure. The phrase cuts across many types of disorders, from explosive behavior in psychotic disorders to compulsions and hysteria. The term probably predates psychiatry, but the use of ego functioning in relation to control dates from the late 1800's, the beginning of modern psychiatry."
Has the time come for this weary phrase to be consigned to the cemetery of stereotype? Ordinarily that order would issue from this department, but I don't want to be accused of being a control freak.
 
Pun Jab
 "Miss Bhutto has Punjab in her grasp, but Sind remains a problem." So goes a line farther back in The Economist, which I am reading because it has a new editor and is going through a news-magazine identity crisis, much as Time is doing here. (If it gets out of control, chaps, see Dr. Ehlers.)
Sind is the home province of Benazir Bhutto, who recently regained power in Pakistan. Though married and a mother, she is known by her maiden name, as befits the daughter of a slain Prime Minister, which is why The Economist calls her "Miss" Bhutto. The New York Times uses "Ms." Bhutto; at least it doesn't assert that she is single.
It's good to see Sind back in the news because it recalls the play on words that so delighted diplomats and linguists of a previous century.
Sir Charles James Napier was the British general sent to quell agitation in India in the early 1840's, and in 1843 -- some say without imperial orders -- moved to take the province of Sind, now part of Pakistan. Nervous diplomats in Westminster awaited the results of the battle of Hyderabad, key to the province. Then came the telegraphed message from Napier: the single Latin word peccavi. The Foreign Office broke into cheers because a knowledge of Latin was the mark of a good education in those days, and because Catholic rites used that word from the penitent seeking absolution from the confessor. Peccavi means "I have sinned."
Napier's message meant, of course, that he had taken the province of Sind. The historical scholar Mark Burnyeat of New York suggested that the general was sending yet another message: because he proceeded on his own initiative, risking overextension of his logistical lines, Napier was both boasting of his victory and mock-apologizing for going beyond his orders with "I have sinned."
You don't get generals using multilingual puns in their messages like that these days.
 
The Fuzz and The Wuzz
 Waking up the sleepy audience at the Radio-Television News Directors Association, Dan Rather of CBS lit into the "Hollywoodization" of news.
"Thoughtfully written analysis is out, 'live pops' are in," he said. (A live pop, also known as a live stand-up, refers to the ad-libbing that a broadcast correspondent in the field does on camera after a news anchor introduces the story. When the anchor says, "Now we're going to Charles, who's standing live in the dark where something happened three hours ago, but you can't see it now," the live pop is what Charles has to ad-lib because he hasn't come back to the studio to write his stand-up.)
Mr. Rather continued: "Hire lookers, not writers. Do powder puff, not probing, interviews. Stay away from controversial subjects. Kiss [vulgarism], move with the mass [rhymes with vulgarism], and for heaven and the ratings' sake don't make anybody mad. . . . Make nice, not news."
The pop that enlivened his speech to slanguists was Rather's complaint that "They've got us putting more fuzz and wuzz on the air." I was familiar with fuzz, defined in Godfrey Irwin's 1931 "American Tramp and Underworld Slang" as "a detective; a prison guard or turnkey. Here it is likely that 'fuzz' was originally 'fuss,' one hard to please or over-particular." But what about wuzz? Was this similarly derived from wuss? Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women, in commenting a few months ago about Hillary Clinton jokes, told The Boston Globe, "The overall theme is one of Bill Clinton being a wuss." She probably used this term as if it were synonymous with wimp, unaware of the etymology of wuss as rhyming slang meaning "like a woman" in a derogatory sense.
The CBS co-anchor, obviously drawn to rhyme in oratory, clarified his catchy phrase in a reply to a query from this department. " 'Fuzz and wuzz' refers to police ('fuzz') and dead bodies (was -- 'wuzz')." In slang, the past tense lives.

HEADLINE: SUNDAY VIEW;
Smashing America's Favorite Myths

BYLINE: By David Richards

 BODY:
Taking the exalted view of America, Lincoln spoke at Gettysburg of "a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal." The playwright Robert Schenkkan, casting his sights lower, sees a country born of greed and deceit and single-mindedly devoted to the notion that all men are fleeceable. In "The Kentucky Cycle," which is finally getting a Broadway hearing more than a year after winning the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for drama, he tallies the costs of our national duplicity.
They are enormous. 
 Everything about this two-part, six-hour chronicle (at the Royale Theater) is outsized, in fact. Made up of nine one-act plays set in Eastern Kentucky, the work begins in 1775 when the pristine forest still belonged to the Indians and a few double-dealing fur traders. Then, in 30- and 40-year leaps, it finds its way down to 1975, by which point the land, not to mention its inhabitants, has been pillaged, raped and left for dead.
Size, of course, is no measure of excellence, only size. Still, if "The Kentucky Cycle" falls short of great playwriting, it qualifies as a vigorous piece of popular storytelling, filled with the kinds of surprises, reversals and sudden revelations that were standard fare in the theater when the theater made a point of reaching out to a broad range of customers.
The 21-member cast, headed by Stacy Keach, plays some six dozen characters -- many of them belonging to three feuding families who sink roots in the area and quickly slip into the patterns of skulduggery and retribution that will prevail for centuries. Mr. Keach, in a gruff and disheveled mode, makes his first appearance, minutes after the lights come up, as Michael Rowen, a volatile Irishman eager to forget his years as an indentured servant and grab some land of his own, whatever the consequences.
Later, he shows up as Michael's great-grandson Jed, a dirt-poor farmer who thinks he's making a killing when he sells the mining rights to the family homestead for $1 an acre. Later still, he's Michael's great-great-great-grandson Joshua, a local official of the United Mine Workers, quick to compromise until a mine shaft collapses and he understands that compromise can be deadly business.
All the cast members, moreover, are engaged in similar stretching exercises. As a major character ages, the role is apt to pass from one actor to the next -- which also suggests the daunting logistics of this endeavor. Nonetheless, Mr. Schenkkan and his director, Warner Shook, back off from little. The production depicts -- convincingly, too -- Civil War skirmishes, underground explosions, strikers coming under machine-gun fire from a passing train, plus slaughter in sundry other forms. Despite the title, "The Kentucky Cycle" is clearly meant to be more than the account of one region's woes. What happens in Appalachia, the playwright implies, is what has happened all across this avaricious country, wherever opportunity has struck and men have struck out at one another. The old myths about the heroic forging of America are being systematically dismantled, replaced by a panorama of rampant self-interest.
Although acted on a stark wooden stage with minimal scenery by Michael Olich -- a rough-hewn pediment marking a home, a square of gravel serving as a forgotten burial ground -- the enterprise often has the feel of a saga spun around campfire embers. (When the actors are not participating in the action, they are, you'll notice, sitting on benches at the sidelines, listening.) No spectator need feel left out.
A few of Mr. Schenkkan's characters go beyond types. Mary Anne Rowen Jackson, a 20th-century miner's wife whom poverty has robbed of everything but her pride, is the most memorable, especially as portrayed with uninflected strength and tight-lipped astringency by Jeanne Paulsen. Her transformation into a union leader, beating saucepans together with controlled fury and rallying the cowardly townsfolk to what has been, up to then, a lost cause, is one of the thrilling highlights of the play's second half.
MOSTLY, THOUGH, MR. Schenkkan relies upon figures of lesser dimensions -- a son (Scott MacDonald) who, under the veneer of oafishness, nurtures patricidal passions; a female slave (Gail Grate) who harbors a deep dark family secret; a speculator (Gregory Itzin) profiting from the economic chaos following the War of 1812 by buying up land and reducing its former owners to groveling sharecroppers.
The good guy/bad guy polarities of melodrama govern much of "The Kentucky Cycle," even if the vast majority of characters are schemers and the good guys don't arrive on the scene until the 20th century. In the words of one character, principles are only "one of those sweet nothin's the big boys whisper in your ear while they pull your pants down." The Civil War is presented as just another opportunity to settle personal vendettas or, in the case of William Clark Quantrill (Randy Oglesby), the Confederate raider, to kill for the mad thrill of killing. The bad guys, however, hide their villainy well while Mr. Schenkkan prepares his coups de theatre. Then, a knife glints in the light or the sharp click of a rifle being cocked disrupts the silence, and baseness reveals its dastardly features.
The effects are calculated. But the dramaturgical hammering and sawing that can make "The Kentucky Cycle" seem old-fashioned are also what make it stageworthy. Ambiguity, indecision, spiritual paralysis -- the hallmarks of much contemporary drama -- are in scant evidence. Some of the characters may share their portent-filled dreams directly with the audience and the playwright has written a lovely speech recollecting the scarlet azaleas, "the spark what lights the fuse for spring," that once exploded across the desolate mountainside. (Ms. Paulsen delivers it with a matter-of-factness that only enhances the poetry.)
On the whole, though, "The Kentucky Cycle" is the least ruminative of plays. Like the young country itself, it itches to get on with things and does so in a dominolike tumble of events.
Yet when I say "least ruminative," that is only partially true. Mr. Schenkkan does have a concern besides the despoliation of America. Even as he himself is undertaking a mammoth act of storytelling, he lets us know that he is leery of stories and their power to cajole.
In the best of the cycle's nine segments, "Tall Tales," which is set in 1890, a roving storyteller by the name of J. T. Wells (Mr. Itzin again) wheedles his way into the Rowen house, mesmerizes the daughter with his worldliness (he's been to New York City) and, between shots of corn likker from a Mason jar, charms her parents with the homeliness of his yarns. The stories, of course, are subterfuge. Wells is really an advance man for Standard Oil, which is hungry for coal. The Rowens, taken in, sign an agreement that will eventually turn their cherished farm into a slag heap.
More than chicanery is involved. Throughout "The Kentucky Cycle," family stories passed down from one generation to the next are altered and embellished with each recounting. Self-interest becomes altruism, cruelty ends up as courage. The truth is lost in the process. To the extent that we, too, are taken in by our treasured historical myths, Mr. Schenkkan believes, we set the country itself up for a dangerous fall.
The immediate appeal of "The Kentucky Cycle," however, is its galloping narrative, and the production comes stripped for action. Over and over again, the crude raked stage and the platforms to either side are transformed by Peter Maradudin's lighting and James Ragland's sound effects, which evoke, impressionistically, a myriad of rustic locales. Mr. Maradudin, in particular, provides primeval sunshine, moon-flecked shadows and just about every degree of illumination in between, and deserves the theatrical equivalent of combat pay. Frances Kenny, a talented costumer, limits her palette to browns, blacks, dirty whites, blood reds and a single yellow accent, the ridiculous plume on the hat of a Confederate dandy. The overall impression of monumental simplicity is misleading; sophisticated artists are at work.
Mr. Shook is after a similar simplicity from his actors -- no fuss, no bother -- and generally he gets it. Everyone operates out of recognizable motives, even if it sometimes takes awhile for the true motive to surface. The emotions on display may be uncomplicated but they are big.
Putting his dapper side on hold, Mr. Keach gives a series of scrappy, vividly chiseled performances. In the cycle's climax, he pours the accumulated frustration and rage of the preceding six hours into a single cry to a lone wolf on a far hill, urging the endangered beast to run for its life. The rousing alarm is, curiously, also a bellow of hope.
As a rule, the actors demonstrate their range not so much within a given part but by moving persuasively from one part to another. Mr. Itzin's affableness, as Standard Oil's front man, for example, proves all the more beguiling for the buried rancor he has shown earlier as that implacable speculator. Here, the accomplished Tuck Milligan is a barefoot boy with cheek, there, a middle-aged Jewish labor organizer with Job's patience. Some of the doubling and tripling only the program confirms for sure. In a work about trickery, you could say the actors are perpetrating gleeful deceptions of their own.
The gusto they bring to the assignment is, I suspect, not just the natural expression of characters caught up in the tumult of changing eras. It is also the gut response of unabashed troupers who relish the juicy melodrama they've been handed and can't wait to jump in.
That may be why, for all the villainy it records, there is ultimately something childlike about "The Kentucky Cycle." The company sits us down, fixes us in the eye and then, without apology or hesitation, dares to say, "Once upon a treacherous time . . ."

Avalon (Nee Trammell Crow) Runs Into Opposition

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
AVALON PROPERTIES, known until last Thursday as a Trammell Crow regional partnership, is a $500 million company with 7,000 rental apartments in 22 East Coast complexes from Virginia to the Canadian border. Since 1986 it has built 2,739 of them in Connecticut -- in Manchester, Middletown, Hamden, Shelton and Stamford.
On Thursday Avalon became a Real Estate Investment Trust, or REIT. It continues to occupy its New Canaan offices as headquarters of the northeast region, but is newly listed on the New York Stock Exchange as Avalon Properties. 
 A REIT is an investment vehicle for real-estate ownership that pays no Federal corporate income tax and, in most states, no state income tax either. It typically distributes nearly all its income, derived primarily from rents, to shareholders. It can manage property as well as own it or lend to it, and can also develop property. But if it sells property there are unfavorable tax consequences.
Avalon Properties in Connecticut is one of two former Trammell Crow partnerships that have become REITs. The other, Gables Residential of Atlanta, is not yet listed on the Exchange but soon will be. Both wanted to go public to be able to raise money through stock offerings and mutual funds because banks and traditional lenders had dried up.
Neither is now connected to the Dallas-based Trammell Crow, which preferred to remain a private construction and real estate management company.
"We have contracted for land accommodating 3,200 more units in the Northeast," said Samuel B. Fuller, Avalon's vice president. "About 1,200 will be in Connecticut."
The company concentrates solely on rentals, and its success has been considerable even through the recession. The attractively priced, low-rise New England village-style complexes tend to move swiftly through municipal-approval procedures, while prospective tenants appear at the sales offices as early as ground-breaking.
But warm receptions around the state have not been duplicated in the wealthy towns of southern Fairfield County, where Avalon has several proposals. In part, the company believes that resistance is based on a misunderstanding of "affordable" housing.
Avalon uses a state program designed to promote housing so described by allowing developers higher density in return for 20-year deed restrictions on 20 percent of their units. These must be offered at rents fixed by a state formula based on statistics from the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
"What most people don't understand is that the affordable units are for people who pay rents upward of $1,000, not for people on welfare," said Mr. Fuller.
After a year of negotiations with New Canaan, Avalon's 104-unit project with 15,000 square feet of office and retail space on Elm Street was rejected earlier this year. The developer sued in Superior Court, and a hearing is expected to be scheduled next month. The dispute involves opposing views of parking and height regulations and a 14- by 400-foot strip along Elm Street that the town says it owns and Avalon says it does not.
IN New Canaan, and in Darien, where 35 acres have been optioned by the company but no plans have been submitted, the median income is $73,400, according to H.U.D. Avalon's three-bedroom units in New Canaan would rent for a maximum of $1,468, or the same as a market-rate one-bedroom unit. Maximum rents are established by taking 80 percent of the median income, then 30 percent of the 80 percent. Variations are possible under the formula depending on family size and the market.
"We might have to charge less," said Mr. Fuller.
In Wilton, the Planning and Zoning Commission approved Avalon's requested zone change, clearing the way for a 120-unit project on 12 acres. But Nancy Burton, a lawyer representing the owner of an abutting property, filed an appeal last month in Stamford Superior Court claiming that the site is in a flood zone of the Norwalk River and inappropriate for high-density development.
Rents in Wilton, under the formula, would be, for example, $1,414 a month for a family of four in a three-bedroom unit.
The Town of Trumbull rejected Avalon's application for 600 units in 1992, whereupon Trammell Crow sued the Planning and Zoning Commission. Last January Trumbull was ordered by the court to negotiate a settlement, resulting in a total of 340 units to be built on the 38-acre site in the spring of 1994.
"It's the first multifamily rental complex in town," said Joan Gruce, Planning and Zoning Administrator. "Nobody wants it, but we have no choice."
Trumbull's median income of $50,200 establishes a maximum rent of $1,004.
In its litigation, the developer relied on the 1989 state Housing Appeals Law, which puts the burden of proof on a town to show that a development in which 20 percent of its units are "affordable" would be injurious to the community. Before 1989 the developer had to prove to the planning and zoning commission that a project was within regulations or would do no harm if zoning concessions were granted.
"There is a concentration of cases in Fairfield County because that's where the least amount of affordable housing exists in the state," said Timothy Hollister, Avalon's lawyer in Hartford.
WHILE Stamford is part of Fairfield County's Gold Coast, it is exempt from the Housing Appeals Law because it has more than the 10 percent minimum of affordable housing that the state mandates for all 169 towns. In 1985, as part of a master-plan study, Stamford determined that it needed 2,500 downtown apartments in all price ranges, but "because of the recession only about a fifth of that number was built," said Robin Stein, acting Director of Planning.
In 1989 Avalon built Town Glen near the city center, with 215 garden apartments surrounding a landscaped court and swimming pool. Like most Trammell Crow properties it has a fitness room, racquetball court, clubhouse, underground parking, security and in-house management. Each apartment is fully applianced, carpeted and painted or wallpapered, and has a private deck. Rents range from the high $900's for one bedroom to $1,600 for two bedrooms and loft.
Avalon's newest venture is Town Grove, a 382-unit complex similar to Town Glen, on a 4-acre site in downtown Stamford. The land is held in foreclosure by a division of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "We have it under contract and will purchase it when the city approves a zone change," said Mr. Fuller. That could happen within the next few months. Rents would be be similar to those at Town Glen.
The company's narrow focus on rentals makes sense to John Knight, professor of finance and real estate at the University of Connecticut, who believes that more people are renting and fewer are buying homes in spite of current sales spurred by low interest rates and prices.
"There are major contributing trends," he said. "One is the recognition that people recognize that they cannot assume, as they did for decades, that prices will go up indefinitely, and by a predictable percentage.
"Then there is the labor market. People don't stay in one job for 30 years any more, nor in one place, except perhaps for doctors, lawyers, real estate brokers and other regionally based professionals. While some people will always be homeowners, globally competitive markets that are evolving don't provide job security."
Avalon targets exactly the sort of transitional population that Professor Knight cites, its tenants typically turning over every three years, and its units constantly at or near 100 percent occupied.

HEADLINE: Studio Owners Struggle to Find Buyers

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
LORI KOCH, a lawyer, is one of the innumerable New Yorkers trapped in a studio that has become a financial straitjacket. Her 570-square-foot apartment, which she bought in 1989, is in a doorman condominium at 295 Greenwich Street at the corner of Chambers Street on the southwestern edge of TriBeCa, a few blocks north of the World Financial Center.
Like many young professionals in the 80's, Ms. Koch dearly wanted to own real estate. She paid well for it, too. Her studio cost $175,000. It's now worth about $90,000 -- if she could find a buyer who could get a mortgage. And while similar apartments in her building are renting for about $1,000 a month, her own monthly costs for carrying her mortgage and paying taxes and monthly fees for building operations total about $1,900. 
 "It's a nightmare," said Ms. Koch, who is 29 years old. "I can't sell it. I can't move. And I can't rent it for anything near my carrying costs."
Since the high point of the real estate boom in the middle 80's, sale prices for studios have plummeted by as much as 60 percent, leading the more moderate decline in prices of co-ops and condominiums generally.
Compounding the problems of those who are trying to sell is the stance of banks, which are reluctant to give loans on smaller studio apartments or on units in buildings that are not primarily occupied by tenant-owners. And potential buyers who might once have had to settle for studios now find that the prices of one-bedroom apartments are within reach.
The average price per room of a co-op studio in Manhattan, which was $66,984 for 1989, had fallen 41.7 percent, to $39,080, as of Aug. 31, according to a survey by Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Manhattan. In real estate surveys, co-op studios are generally considered to have two to two and a half rooms.
For condominiums, prices fell 26.7 percent, to $252 a square foot, as of Aug. 31, from $344 a square foot for 1989, according to the Douglas Elliman report.
A similar situation prevails elsewhere in New York City and in suburban communities, brokers report. "The values are just not there anymore for studios," said Margaret S. Scott, president of Mortgage Advisory Services, a mortgage broker in Manhattan. "There are too many of them."
When the more hard-pressed owners seek out advice on what to do, they are often advised to make an effort to restructure their debt, preferably by banding together with others in the building who have similar problems.
"I don't think there is an alternative to a workout except for the bankruptcy option, but only if you are really in the hole," said Edward T. Braverman, a real estate lawyer in Manhattan.
FOR those in not quite such dire straits, Mr. Braverman suggested cutting losses as quickly as possible. "In this kind of market, the best way to get your money back is to buy something else of a much better quality and when the market rebounds you make back more of your loss than you would have by holding on to something that was a bad deal in the first place," he said.
"The studios were such a bad deal," he added. "There is such a large volume in the city and the prices are not going to increase as quickly or to the same extent as larger apartments."
Some studio owners have turned their one-room units into more-marketable one-bedroom apartments by adding a wall or two. Owners should be aware, though, that in most cases structural alterations cannot be made without the approval of the co-op board or condominium association.
Co-op boards could even be cited for violations because the building may no longer comply with its certificate of occupancy as the number of rooms on that floor would have changed.
The board would also want to make sure that the alterations were safe and would not damage neighboring apartments or those above or below.
The future looked rosier when the purchases were initially made. Young buyers thought of themselves as taking the traditional first step on the ladder of homeownership. Other buyers were perhaps older and wealthier suburbanites, purchasing a Manhattan pied-a-terre for intermittent use. Still others were corporations buying for use by personnel traveling through New York, or investors planning to rent apartments out. Many of these buyers, under no pressure to sell, are presumably holding on and waiting for an eventual market upturn.
In the present market, however, the desirability of studios for buyers is hurt by what economists and real estate brokers call "the substitution effect."
Alan Rogers, a managing partner at Douglas Elliman, said that many first-time buyers today were moving into one-bedroom apartments instead of studios. "It doesn't make much sense to buy a studio when you can get a one-bedroom for $100,000 to $200,000," he said. "Why go for one less room? There is a great value in one-bedroom apartments today, especially with low interest rates. For an extra $30,000, why not buy a one-bedroom?"
Sales, particularly those in some co-op buildings, are also being hurt by high monthly maintenance payments required by some co-ops, and by the refusal of lenders to finance properties smaller than 600 square feet or those in buildings with owner-occupancy rates below 51 percent.
Lenders are also increasingly reluctant to finance apartments in walk-ups and buildings where there are fewer than 10 units. Potential difficulty in selling the units is the chief reason.
"There are loans that some lenders just won't touch," Ms. Scott said. "Studios are increasingly in that category. As a result, borrowers who want to buy them are really having a difficult time finding loans."
Though prices for studio apartments in both co-ops and condominiums have been heading down, the gap in relative value between the two seems to be widening, with the studio-co-ops losing ground. In a survey conducted by the Halstead Property Company in Manhattan in the first quarter of 1991, the average condominium studio sold for 30 percent more than a co-op studio. In the first quarter of 1993, the average condominium studio sold for 92 percent more.
Clark Halstead, managing partner of Halstead, attributed the price difference to the underlying building mortgages that are typical in co-ops. The actual cost of a co-op is the purchase price for the shares plus a pro rata share of the underlying debt. Condominiums, however, do not have underlying mortgages, so the entire cost of a unit resides in the purchase price.
Mr. Halstead said that, generally, underlying debt added about 20 to 25 percent to the price of a co-op. This accounts for the higher cost of condominiums, but not for the growing spread in prices, particularly among studios. He said that much of the appeal of condominium over co-op studios lay in the ability to sell or rent them without board approval.
Besides screening prospective buyers, many co-op boards also have policies that either forbid subtenants or allow them for only one or two years.
ULTIMATELY, Mr. Halstead said, this means that in a declining market for sales and a rising market for rentals, condominium studio owners are able to rent. Co-op studio owners, on the other hand, are forced to sell, often for prices much below the purchase price; to remain in their unit or to move out and continue paying the maintenance.
"Co-ops lost more value in the down cycle than condos," Mr. Halstead said. "Condos are a better-grade investment. This is particularly apparent in the studio and one-bedroom units, which were the hardest hit in the recession."
Barbara Braderman is one of the many New Yorkers who own a studio co-op and can rent their units for no longer than two years. Her 600-square-foot unit at 363 East 76th Street is being offered for sale at $85,000. She estimated it was worth about $110,000 in the mid-80's.
"I had an offer two years ago for $86,000," she said. "But things have gotten worse since then. I'm sure I won't get $85,000."
Ms. Braderman currently lives in her studio and wants to sell because the bank where she works as a computer systems manager is expected to cut its workforce soon and she plans to leave the area if she loses her position.
"I've had a few people look, but they say the price is too high," she said. She would not say what she paid for it.
Betsy Tuft is also having trouble selling her 625-square-foot alcove studio on East 85th Street near the East River. . It is being offered at $75,000; the maintenance is $528 a month. "People look, but no call-backs," she said.
Ms. Tuft won't say what she paid for her unit in 1980; it was an insider price. She did say, though, that she could have sold it for about $140,000 in the late 80's. So she lives in another unit in the buildin and has been renting out the alcove studio unit. On Dec. 1, however, her tenant moves out and, under the rules of her co-op, she will no longer be able to rent it, but she will be liable for the monthly maintenance.
She said that two units in her building had been foreclosed because the owners had been unable to sell them and were barred from renting them out for longer than two years. "I'll manage," she said. "I'll do the best I can. Maybe I'll lower the price."
Renee Jaffess of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., is in a similar situation. For the last year she has been been renting out a 560-square-foot studio in a doorman building at 251 East 51st Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan. She bought the unit in 1976. Like Ms. Tuft, she will not disclose how much she paid for the unit, but she estimates it was worth as much as $140,000 in the mid-80's. The maintenance is $521.11.
She is now offering it for $65,000 and is considering a woman's bid of $58,000. The woman "is concerned about the maintenance," Ms. Jaffess said. "She is concerned about its going up."
Ms. Jaffess's co-op board has let her to rent out the unit for the last year and has refused an extension. "They just wouldn't," she said.
The experience has soured Ms. Jaffess on the New York real estate market. "I would never buy an apartment again in Manhattan," she said.
THE situation could be worse. Ms. Koch, the owner of the TriBeCa studio, not only can't sell her unit or rent it out for any amount close to her monthly costs, but she also has a balloon mortgage with the sponsor that requires her to refinance soon and make a $35,000 payment; she made only a $5,000 downpayment in 1989.
With the apartment now worth about $85,000 less than the outstanding mortgage, many owners might think twice about making a $35,000 down payment to keep the apartment. Ms. Koch, though, is willing. She just doesn't have the $35,000.
"Because of the economy, my salary hasn't increased the way I thought it would," she said.
Ms. Koch has asked to have the debt restructured or renegotiated, but the sponsor has declined and is threatening foreclosure. In similar cases, a homeowner would consider allowing a foreclosure to go forward or even filing for bankruptcy protection. Ms. Koch's troubles are compounded, though, by the fact that her sister, also a homeowner, is a co-signer on her mortgage.
"No one ever thought things would turn out like this," Ms. Koch said.
But a housing market is rarely bereft of buyers entirely, and Manhattan studios often have the advantage of highly desirable locations.
One such buyer recently was Eleonora Minkovsky, an insurance executive from Philadelphia. She paid all cash for a 600-square-foot alcove studio in a doorman building at 167 East 67th Street for $75,000; the maintenance is $424. Ms. Minkovsky's daughter, Julia, plans to live in the studio while participating in an executive training program at Bloomingdale's.
It was cheaper to buy than to rent a comparable apartment, Ms. Minkovsky said. "Rents in that neighborhood were $1,100 to $1,300 a month," she said.
The possibility of not being able to sell or rent out the unit doesn't trouble her, either. "People are afraid that they won't be able to sell," she said. "But we decided to ignore that. In two or three years, we'll see what happens."

HEADLINE: Habitats/TriBeCa Rowhouses;
A Sale on Harrison St.

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
THEY'VE always looked incongruous -- stalwart foes of relentless progress, dwarfed by the massive Independence Plaza housing complex in TriBeCa.
A row of fine Federal town houses on Harrison Street, off Greenwich Street, the nine two-and-a-half story houses look new -- almost like Williamsburgh reproductions. 
 For the first time since they were gutted and auctioned by the city in the late 70's, one of them is to be resold. It is the smallest in the dormered row, the corner house at 25 Harrison.
In 1976, the city embarked on what one reporter called "the first, and probably the last" venture of its kind. While six of these late-18th- and early-19th-century houses would remain in the midst of the urban renewal area, three others would be moved to form an enclave in the midst of the new moderate-income high-rise housing development.
The houses were vacant and abandoned. Some had been used as warehouses. The little brick house with the beaded white clapboard side was moved from 314 Washington Street and put on the corner, next to two others that had been moved from sites nearby.
Judging from news reports, the city's action was controversial, mainly because of the cost: $600,000 to restore the exteriors of the nine houses and $250,000 to move three from sites farther down Washington Street. They then were sold to private citizens at $35,000 to $72,000 each.
At the time, Roger Starr, the administrator of the city's housing agency, then known as the Housing and Development Administration, said that without money from Federal, state and city governments "these wonderful old buildings would have remained . . . deteriorated, dusty, imperfectly adapted to incongruous commercial uses, and waiting only for an upturn in land values to crumble under the hammer of a land auctioneer."
Those first homeowners were pioneers. The area -- not yet known generally as TriBeCa -- was bleak at night, not the thriving neighborhood of loft residences it has become.
The new owners had to deal with structures that were little more than brick shells. There were no interior partitions, and no plumbing or wiring. Barton Fleishman, who bought the largest of the houses for $72,000, said the other day that he eventually spent about $200,000 to make it livable.
Randolph Winchester King Jr., the lawyer who started trying to buy the small house on the corner in December 1976 and finally succeeded in 1978, paid $48,000 for his shell. He calls his first year of renovations "the Year of Living Dangerously."
He put the house on the market last January. The prospective buyer, Barrie Mandel, a real estate agent, said that Mr. King had originally asked $850,000.
As a broker, Ms. Mandel showed the house to customers but wanted to buy it herself. She and her husband, Dr. Harvey Schneier, an internist, and their three children were renting in the same row, two houses down.
"I said to the broker when the house comes down to the low fives I'll buy it," said Ms. Mandel. "The broker said 'Yeah, you and the rest of the world.' But he called me and told me when the house was reduced to $595,000." She brought her husband to look at it. They now have a contract to pay $535,000.
In the back, a bluestone patio leads into a private open garden, punctuated by rose arbors and boxwood hedges. In the back of 25 Harrison is a large crabapple tree whose white flowers blanket the bluestone in spring and whose hard little red fruits crush up against the house's small paned windows in autumn.

HEADLINE: A Leader's Lessons From Adversity Unite Town and Gown

BYLINE: By BILL RYAN

 BODY:
THE president of Eastern Connecticut State University, David G. Carter, roams about the campus greeting students by name, usually accompanied by a little personal message or friendly banter.
"Did you ever clean up that spot on the carpet in your room? I'll drop some 'Miracle Clean' off and you can get to it." "You been hitting the books this week? Yeah, sure." 
 His ability to couple students' names with their dormitories, interests, even specific grades, is an art he honed in his childhood, he explained, except then he was etching numbers into his memory on a daily basis.
 
Delinquency and Hustling in Early Years
 He was running numbers, as early as when he was 8 years old. And he was very good at it, never keeping any written records that might be used as evidence against him by the police in Dayton, Ohio, who frowned on people, and most certainly on children, engaging in the illegal business of betting on numbers.
Today, Mr. Carter, who is now 51, said he uses his photographic memory for more constructive and legal purposes though he doesn't mind talking about his early life, of the numbers racket, of delinquency, of hustling for a living in one of the major slums of Middle America where he grew up. He saw people killed. He saw people maimed. He saw people going nowhere, and when he looked in the mirror one of them was him.
The downhill slide of his boyhood started when he was 5 and his family's home, above a grocery store his father owned, was destroyed in a fire. His mother was badly burned. He was burned on his face and hands and spent nine months in a hospital, then tried to hide his scarred hands by wearing gloves. Within a year, his father was dead of a heart attack while still trying to rebuild the store. His mother, a strong, religious woman who had always believed in the work ethic, was disfigured. And the family had gone from middle class to very poor. "It was so bad once that my mother and my brother, Joe, and I all slept in the same bed, along with a BB gun for shooting the rats."
 
Encouraged to Go to College
 As willing as he is to talk about a time that had more than its share of horrors, he is equally willing to talk about the many people who helped him climb out of the slum in Dayton, particularly two sisters, white schoolteachers named Ruth and Catherine Everitt, who saw something in a black youngster often in trouble or suspended from school that most others, particularly the authorities, were missing. The women helped him, giving him jobs to do and then overpaying him, he said, but mostly by encouraging him to do something better with his life, including going to college. One day he decided to quit hustling and try that. And he was hooked.
A few decades later, with degrees from three Ohio universities, including a doctorate in philosophy from Ohio State University, he went home to Dayton. The former delinquent was now the superintendent of the city school system.
Today, he sounds almost like a Horatio Alger character, transferred into the 20th century. The two schoolteachers "taught me people could be benefactors, not adversaries," he said. "All the people who helped me, they touched me and they gave me an obligation to touch someone else. That's what matters in life."
That's his message, and if you don't get it, he will just keep trying. He has the energy, seemingly an unlimited supply of it. "I know I'm hyperactive," he said. "That's a disadvantage of learning from adversity. You try too hard. I don't want to fail."
After the job in Dayton and teaching positions at two Pennsylvania universities, Mr. Carter arrived in Connecticut. He was the associate vice president for academic affairs at the University of Connecticut five years ago when he was offered the job of president of Eastern Connecticut State University.
The opportunity both enthralled and dismayed him. The good part, he said, was that it was a small university, about 4,000 students, a place where he could really get to know students and faculty members. The bad part was that it was virtually unknown, tucked away on a hill that rises up from the center of the small city of Willimantic, an isolated place of higher education in a blue-collar city, physically there but not really part of it. Even the main entrance, off Hill Street, was hard to find.
 
Eliminated Portable Classrooms
 In addition, its physical plant was somewhat less than adequate. David Carter's voice still goes up an octave or two when he talks about that: "They had these portable classrooms. They were probably put up 40 years ago. You were lucky you didn't go right through the floor when you walked in, they were that bad. If you value people, you don't put them in places like that."
He got rid of the portable classrooms. Five years after he took over the university, the initial phase of a $138 million renovation of the college has been completed, including a new dormitory and a new classroom building, with a target date of 2005 for the remainder.
He has even planted neat rows of flowers in the central area. The university president is much addicted to neatness, starting with himself -- shoes shined to a gloss, crease in pants like a knife -- and extending into all corners of his domain. As he travels about the campus, he likes to drop in at dormitories unannounced. He will knock on a door, yell "Hey, it's me," as if everyone inside should know by the voice who it is, and most do. He winces when he sees disarray, congratulates the occupants when one of the apartments is neat and clean. Neatness, he likes, order he likes.
 
Got Money From the State
 One major question is how, in a period of extreme austerity, Mr. Carter has been able to get the money out of the state for major capital improvements while other institutions, including the big University of Connecticut in the next town, are screaming for money. He smiled at the question and discoursed at length. The overall answer seemed to be that you have got to know how to hustle to get money out of the General Assembly, with the addenda that there are bad hustles and good hustles and this is a good hustle. He can fire off statistic after statistic in the effort to demonstrate that Eastern deserves special consideration. "Sixty percent of our students are the first members of their families who ever went to college. We have 34 nations from around the world represented here. Our minority percentage is up to 14 now."
Other state universities may be losing students but not Eastern. The gain is not dramatic: total enrollment of 4,576 this fall in contrast to 4,495 in the fall of 1992. But the figures do go against the trend.
The president has also brought the university closer to Willimantic than it had been in the past. Willimantic is a very poor place. The huge fortress-like buildings of American Thread Company sit vacant at one end of Main Street, ghosts of a textile industry that long ago went South. Now Willimantic, part of the town of Windham, is plagued with high unemployment and attendant social ills.
 
Community-Oriented College
 During a school year every student "has to perform eight hours of community service," Mr. Carter said, "some of them do 300 hours."
Windham's First Selectman, Walter M. Pawelkiewicz said he first met Mr. Carter when he was studying for a doctorate at the University of Connecticut and Mr. Carter was teaching education courses. Now he credits him for a new spirit of cooperation between the community and the university.
"Singlehandedly, he has transformed the university into a model of a community-oriented college," Mr. Pawelkiewicz said. "We have students interning in all our service agencies and schools. We have a town-gown meeting twice a month. For the first time, the town is involved in campus expansion and development of programs. Generally, people at an urban college talk a good game but don't produce. He produces."
And up on the hill, David Carter studies the master plan for his university, explaining every facet of it with obvious delight. He likes the place. He likes his job. "I'm a blessed man," he said. "I wasn't even supposed to go to college."

THE ECONOMY
 
The Trade Vote's Over, But the Debate Isn't
It's all over but the celebrations, the name-calling, the second-guessing -- so it's far from over. With Bill Clinton sprinting to the tape in his lobbying marathon, the House passed the North American Free Trade Agreement last week, by a surprisingly comfortable 34-vote margin. But the vote didn't banish the ambiguities -- the main one being, will this nation lose or gain jobs? (Check back in a decade or so on that one.) There was no ambiguity to the President's victory. The only questions were whether he cut too many side deals for votes, whether he squandered too much political capital. Another clear winner: President Salinas of Mexico. The pact could vault Mexico into the big leagues. A clear loser: organized labor, which went all out to defeat the pact. 

Bulletin: Women Work, Too
When it comes to statistics, the Government is quick on the draw. A month ends, and out come data on unemployment, consumer confidence, you name it. But if Washington realizes some numbers are flawed, it takes a lot longer to shift its huge, rusty gears. Realizing back in 1986 that its joblessness surveys were missing a lot of women, the Labor Department started pondering an overhaul. But not till last week did it come up with a fix. The survey, it seems, often asks women if they were "keeping house or something else," while asking men if they were "working or something else." That bias led many women who were seeking work to be skipped, because you're unemployed only if you're actively job-hunting. But come January, the department said, the surveys will be fixed, the bias gone . . . and the numbers probably higher: By the new count, the total rate for the year ending in August was 7.6 percent, not 7.1.
 
Yes, it was clearly equality-of-the-sexes week. Even the Roman Catholic Church, not what you'd normally call a crusader for women's rights, got into the act, as the nation's bishops came up with the revolutionary idea that men should share fully in child rearing and housework. So, guys, get with it: Turn off that football game and change that diaper.
 
What's Good for Real Estate . . .
A sure sign of the recession a few years back was that no one was buying houses. Who, after all, would make such a daunting investmest in an iffy economy? So as evidence mounts that we're inching, statistic by statistic, back toward prosperity, perhaps the most heartening news is in housing: Last week came a report that builders broke ground in October at the fastest rate in over three years. It's now expected that 1.1 million homes will be built this year, almost up to the level of 1987, back when "safe as houses" still meant something.
 
And the numbers kept rolling in last week: Industrial production rose 0.8 percent in October, the fifth straight gain and the biggest rise in nearly a year. Sales of domestic cars surged 12.4 percent in early November.
 
What Government Fat, Mr. Gore?
The Administration is overflowing with ideas for spending money; the only problem is where to get it. Al Gore offered a suggestion last month, a "reinventing" that would streamline Government and save a hefty $108 billion. It sounded good. Cut the fat, and use the savings for noble causes like fighting crime. But last week the Congressional Budget Office said: Wait a second, those numbers don't quite add up. While the Administration had predicted that the first phase of the streamlining would save $6 billion, the budget office -- which generally uses stricter accounting rules -- said the savings would be only about 5 percent of that. Oh, well, there's always a tax increase.

The Perfect Way To Hurt an Airline
How do you hit an airline where it hurts? Simple. Just ground its planes over Thanksgiving, when Americans have this uncontrollable craving to eat pumpkin pie somewhere else -- anywhere, as long as it's a plane ride away. So last week American Airlines' flight attendants -- amid disputes over scheduling, wages and benefits, among other things -- did just that, vowing to strike till the turkey's cold. Travel was a mess if you had an American ticket. But for the flight attendants, it's a big gamble: American insists strikers will be replaced.
 
G.M. Hands Over a Nest Egg
It's amazing the sums that a little creative bookkeeping can conjure up. A big thorn in General Motors' side is the huge gap -- about $24 billion -- between what it has promised to retirees and what it has set aside. But last week it said it had found a way to throw $5.7 billion into the pot fairly painlessly. It wants to donate 185 million class E shares, which are tied to the performance of its Electronic Data Systems unit, to the pension plan, and somehow it says it can do it without diluting earnings for current class E shareholders. One wonders what other little nest eggs are tucked away in its books for a rainy day.
 
G.M. felt so confident last week that it even said its North American operations, on which it has lost billions in recent years, could actually turn a profit next year. Investors must have been convinced, because G.M. stock hit a yearly high, ending the week at $54.25.
 
Baxter Feels the Health Pinch
As the health care dinosaur flails about in this changing world, its tail keeps knocking things over. Cost pressure has forced cuts in surgeries and hospital stays, and those cuts have rippled through to a top hospital supply company, Baxter International. Baxter said last week that it was cutting 4,500 jobs.
 
Prudential Insurance's Turn
Prudential Insurance already had its hands full when its brokerage subsidiary agreed to pay $371 million to settle S.E.C. fraud charges. But last week accusations of fraud rose to the parent, as a top Prudential executive sued the company, saying it had routinely defrauded institutional investors in a real estate fund. The executive, Mark Jorgensen, asserts that various properties, like the New York Hilton, were carried on the books at inflated values -- to make the fund look better. And when he blew the whistle, he said, he was demoted.
 
Bias Penalty for Shawmut
If you're white and apply for a mortgage, you have a 15 percent chance of rejection; if you're black or Hispanic, the odds are about twice as bad. The Federal Reserve wants this to stop, and, citing possible lending bias, has stymied one bank's expansion plans. Like many banks these days, Shawmut National of Hartford wants to grow by acquiring, but last week the Fed turned down its purchase of the New Dartmouth Bank of Manchester, N.H.
 
Southwest Buys Boeing Jets
Southwest Airlines has redefined air travel by using only smaller jetliners that carry about 130 passengers. So if such planes are the wave of the future, Boeing now seems assured of a place in that future. Last week Southwest ordered 63 Boeing 737-X jets, the new version of the planes it uses now. The order, worth around $2.5 billion, is a signal that Boeing is not going to be left in the dust by Airbus Industrie. And it shows that Southwest has no intention of disappearing into the sunset: It's the largest order in its 22-year history.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
No Rest for a Trade Warrior
President Clinton was on a roll last week, and it was called free trade. No sooner had he sealed a House victory on opening his own hemisphere's borders than he sped to Seattle, for a meeting of a new trade group for Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation, to try to bring Asia into the fold. Mr. Clinton didn't forget the home front. "Make no mistake," he said. "Ultimately this meeting is about the jobs and futures and incomes of the American people."
 
In U.S. Eyes, China Equals Trade
The trade angle also reigned supreme last week when the Administration agreed to sell China an $8 million supercomputer and lift a ban on components for nuclear power plants. The White House sought no concessions on, say, human rights or nuclear-weapons testing. All it wants, it seems, is a big chunk of China's huge market. That's good news for General Electric, which already has a foot in China's nuclear power door, and for Cray Research, maker of that supercomputer. But to critics like Senator Paul Simon, "It's a mistake. We have to be firmer with China."
 
Chrysler Sells a Costly Toy
Well, Chrysler is past its midlife crisis, that odd period when the American male takes his mind off a receding hairline by buying a red sports car. When Chrysler felt this urge six years ago, it went for the top, buying the maker of the ultimate fantasy machine -- the Lamborghini. But now that it's settled down -- and doing quite well at it -- it has no time for such whims, especially as the market collapsed for cars whose prices look more at home in real estate listings. And where is the fanciful money flowing these days? An Indonesian group is buying the Italian car maker.

Reading the Road: 3 for the Holidays

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
O.K., boys and girls, remember study hall? Remember tablets and yellow Dixon pencils and how we spent the time sketching dream cars?
Some of us were going to be designers and work in Detroit and flesh out those drawings. Show them. Or at least, if you were like me, you were going to be a commercial artist, maybe the successor to Fred Harmon, who drew Red Ryder and Little Beaver. 
 In most cases, it didn't happen. But Philip Trachtman followed through, and he has had various careers, all of them in art and ranging from advertising to founding and running the Art Institute of Philadelphia.
Through it all, too, he has maintained his love for automobiles and has peddled cartoons to national magazines. Now, at age 69, he has put a bunch of them together in a funny paperback called "Motor Mania," and he sees a new career ahead.
"I think there's a very broad interest in old cars or cars with sentimental value," he said on the phone from his home in Princeton, N.J. "As people age, the cars of their youth become collectible. And who knows when the models from the 70's or 80's will look good."
All he has to do is last, he said.
In the meantime, there probably will be more like this 64-page collection, published by Paramount Press of Princeton. The $9.75 book can be ordered by dialing 800-508-9515. It is about 9 inches square and slim enough to roll and wrap as a surprise stocking gift for Christmas.
The cars are beautifully drawn and the cartoons are New Yorkeresque. There is, too, a "goofy glossary of demented definitions," which includes words like "defuse" (to make or become harmless or powerless, as when your car quit because defuse burned out).
Corny, yes, but when you are a committed car nut, well. . . .
Another new book -- this one a hardcover and a true gem -- is "Where the Road and the Sky Collide," published by Henry Holt & Company and available for $22.50 in most bookstores.
It is subtitled "America Through the Eyes of Its Drivers," and the author is listed as K. T. Berger, although the K stands for Kevin and the T stands for Todd, California brothers who call themselves car biologists and who previously penned "Zen Driving."
Oddly, given that we have a pair of writers, the viewpoint is first-person singular, but the style works beautifully, and this just might be the most readable automobile book around. That is both because of an ear (four ears, actually) for language and because its 368 pages deal with people and places more than with hardware.
The idea was to send out thousands of questionnaires with the help of J. D. Power & Associates, then to make a tour of the country in a Dodge minivan and talk to some of the respondents about their "agonies and ecstasies on the king's highways."
They wanted to know about the impact of the automobile, about its current state and about whether it might be teetering on the slippery edge of extinction.
"One hundred years after its invention," they write, "the car is in big trouble. Traffic and its attendant emotional stress (six-shooters and Valium in the glove compartment) rank as the most dramatic problem of driving today, but no less consequential is the economic stress -- the ever-increasing expense of owning and operating an automobile."
Driving alone costs our city governments $60 billion a year, they say, and then there is the $55 billion spent each year on imported oil and the billions that the economy loses as workers everywhere sit in traffic, producing nothing but fumes and wallowing in angst.
Yet the Berger Boys like cars, and it shows. Meet, for instance, the former street racer with his tales of a Corvette-powered Porsche (after an accident with the Porsche, a bus driver stops to help and says: "I just knew you were in trouble when you passed me backward."). Or Macon Fry, a 35-year-old teacher of autistic students in New Orleans.
"His house was constructed of bargeboard and other odd assortments of whatever was handy," the Bergers write. " 'Whatever you need,' Macon said, 'sooner or later floats down. You just have to ask yourself how bad do you want it and will it float. Then you wait.' "
Out on the levee is Macon's battered green '57 Ford F-100, the pickup that's as dear to his heart as the swamp. But his feel for city streets is something else: "New Orleans, he said, was an exotic area to drive around in. After he'd been upcountry, he always loved coming back to the city." But the actual driving experience soon wore thin.
"There's potholes that my girlfriend's Hyundai can easily fall into. I mean, her Hyundai's great for going and traveling around the state, but here in the city, you'd best have a truck or something big like an Oldsmobile where, at worst, maybe only the front end's gonna fall in."
Along the way, the Bergers also meet truckers, New York cabbies, Detroit executives, traffic planners and environmentalists, and they make the experience fascinating. This is one trip not to be missed.
Another odyssey, less grand but no less pertinent, is documented in "Solo: Life With an Electric Car," by Noel Perrin, a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College who decided to reverse history by driving east to the future from California. The 192-page volume, published by W. W. Norton & Company, is available for $18.95 in stores or by calling 800-233-4830.
Solo is the name of Perrin's electric car, a converted 1985 Ford Escort in which he attempts a lone cross-country trip. Unfortunately, the red station wagon has a range of less than 60 miles, and Perrin soon longs for internal combustion.
"What an electric car has is a voltage gauge," he writes. "And what is a volt, besides a memorial to Count Volta? It's a unit of force, not of quantity, and a little bit comparable to the speed with which a river is flowing, as opposed to the volume of water in it. I find it hard to think in volts."
He also finds it hard to find fill-ups, and he winds up making the trip neither solo nor by amps alone. More than that I won't say, because part of the book's charm is the uncertainty of the endeavor, but Perrin's narrative carries us right along.
In California, he hears "neat," "cool" and "terrific," and he notes that Californians either are "the politest of all Americans, or else there is a genuine and widespread interest in alternative vehicles." Indeed there is -- although he experiences scorn in Utah and skepticism in Wyoming. Elsewhere, he meets kindred spirits, and a close look at the history and future of the electric automobile sets out both problems and prospects.
The author made the trip two years ago, but he still has the little red wagon, using it for the daily 13-mile commute from his home in Thetford, Vt., to Dartmouth, across the border in Hanover, N.H.
Solo remains inexpensive and Perrin has discovered other advantages as the driver of a zero-pollution vehicle, not least the fact that he has been given a rare reserved parking spot on the campus. It's the one by the building's exterior electrical outlet.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Latin America Finds Harmony in Convergence

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
ON the face of it, the North American Free Trade Agreement approved by the House of Representatives last week after a long and acrimonious debate is a document narrow in scope, affecting only commercial relations with Mexico and Canada. But its passage was greeted with relief and excitement throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, where there is similar movement toward a closer relationship with the United States -- movement that would likely have been derailed had the trade pact been rejected.
Just a decade ago, it would have been difficult to imagine Latin American leaders, with Mexico in the lead, clamoring for closer economic, political and cultural ties with the Colossus of the North, their historical nemesis. But a new breed of pragmatic reformer has emerged in country after country in recent years to put into practice the twin virtues of democracy and open markets that Washington had long been preaching. To them, Nafta was a test of both the sincerity and reliability of the United States. 
 Thus there was alarm throughout the region when it seemed that Congress might hesitate, and jubilation when the Clinton Administration triumphed. "This was not a handshake at arm's length," said Mark Rosenberg, director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University here. "This was an embrace, and Latin America knows it."
In ways both symbolic and practical, Nafta therefore consolidates the profound changes in attitude and approach that have already occurred in Latin America, and creates new opportunities for convergence with the United States. Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American Development Bank, a Washington-based organization that last year alone lent $6 billion for projects like roads, sanitation and small businesses, said he regards Nafta as the most significant American initiative toward Latin America in his lifetime -- far more important, he said, than Franklin Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy or John Kennedy's Alliance for Progress.
"For us, Nafta means we really count for the first time," Mr. Iglesias, a former foreign minister of Uruguay, said after watching the debate and vote from the gallery of the House Wednesday night. "In a world of uncertainties, it is reassuring to leaders of the region to know that we can bet on the friendship of the United States. We now become partners in a joint venture, and that gives us an anchor for the economic reform process."
But Hernando de Soto, a Peruvian who is the author of "The Other Path," a best-seller throughout Latin America that has become the bible of economic reformers, predicted that "the political consequences of Nafta will be even more interesting than the economic ones, at least in the short term." In the same way that Spaniards became Europeanized by joining the European Community after decades of authoritarian rule, he said, "the virtues of a modern society" now have a chance to prevail in Latin American nations that long struggled under the twin burdens of military rule and economic policies that enriched only the elite.
It was the collapse of that system under a mountain of debt in the early 1980's that led to what Latin Americans call the Lost Decade, 10 years of economic stagnation, declining wages and net outflows of capital that made the poor poorer and destroyed the middle class. More out of desperation than confidence, newly enfranchised voters throughout the region turned to young civilian leaders who prescribed austerity and argued that the United States, though a contributor to the region's problems, could also be part of a solution.
Now, with Nafta in place and ideological tensions diminished, those polished technocrats can see light at the end of the tunnel and the possibility of resurrecting a consumer-minded middle class. As Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, the President of Bolivia, phrased it in a plea on behalf of the pact to Congress a week before the vote, the world's largest trading bloc "will be like a sun, and the rest of our economies will be like planets in orbit around it," basking in its glow and stimulated to remove barriers among themselves.
Mr. Sanchez de Lozada recognizes that for the time being, Mexico will enjoy an advantage over other Latin American countries and is likely to attract the lion's share of American investment and attention. But "as we achieve certain standards and certain levels of growth and maturity and in our economies," he also said, his and other countries eventually will also gain "access to this wonderful system of free trade, standardization of democratic practices, labor laws and environmental sensitivity."
Having spent so much political capital getting Congress to approve free trade with Mexico, Mr. Clinton may not be inclined to move quickly on requests from Chile and Argentina, the most likely candidates to follow in Mexico's steps, during his first term. But at the very least, the embrace of Mexico encourages reformers throughout Latin America to continue, if not accelerate, efforts to open up and modernize their societies.
That shot in the arm is especially important in the dozen countries with presidential elections scheduled over the next year, beginning with Honduras later this month and ending with Brazil next fall. "These changes do not get unanimity," Mr. Iglesias observed. "There are debates all over, and that is why with this sort of opening by the United States, reformism gets a boost. It shows there is life after the sacrifices we are making now."
 
Cultural Momentum
 But even as that political debate goes on, the momentum toward integration builds, thanks in large part to advances in communications and transportation. MTV, CNN, HBO, and ESPN, all now available in Spanish, are avidly consumed from Monterrey to Mendoza, and faxes and electronic mail have also reduced the distance between North and South America. The traffic flows in both directions, with visitors from Caracas or Buenos Aires increasingly coming to Miami, Houston and Los Angeles to shop, open businesses, buy real estate, keep doctors' appointments or just attend a baseball game.
In such a world, absolute sovereignty becomes impossible and interdependence seems the order of the day. No wonder, then, that Puerto Rico, which last week voted narrowly to remain an autonomous commonwealth tied to the United States rather than seek statehood, feels less defensive about its status and is even offering itself as a model for relations between the two Americas. "Other Latin American countries are seeking to break down the barriers of sovereignty and enter into an economic association with the United States," Rafael Luis Morales, a 35-year-old teacher in the mountain town of Aibonito, said proudly last month. "But we Puerto Ricans already have that, and it has done wonders for us."
Of course, if the shift to open markets does not deliver improvements in living standards, or if the United States to move forward, Latin America might be tempted to flirt again with populist authoritarianism. But, Mr. de Soto said, "a cultural barrier of sorts has been broken" on both sides with Nafta and it would be hard to return to the patterns of the past. "Having broken through the mental barrier, steps toward full integration now come much more naturally. All of a sudden, it's not that big a problem, gringos and Latinos getting together."

HEADLINE: Clinton Puts a Foot In the Opening Door Of the Global Market

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
WHAT may be the biggest rethinking of American policy toward Asia since the days of Gen. Douglas MacArthur is finally under way, and President Clinton began to outline it last week just inside a giant airplane hangar at the Boeing Company.
Boeing is, after all, the country's largest exporter, and as Mr. Clinton told a cheering throng, its booming Asian business is a model for companies across America. China alone now buys one of every six of its planes; Asian airlines own half of all the 747's ever made. But there is a less-discussed price. The fuselage of Boeing's newest jet, still 18 months from delivery, isn't built by Boeing, but by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries at the plant in Nagoya, Japan, that spit out Zeros for World War II. Just as America insisted in the 1980's that Japan build its cars in America, the rest of the world has caught on to the concept of "local content." So Boeing has announced 28,000 layoffs here while some of its Pacific partners are hiring. To keep its opportunities for growth alive, there is no other choice. Such are the realities that Bill Clinton and his economic strategists have begun to acknowledge in a new vision of American relations with Asia -- a vision that Mr. Clinton spelled out forcefully at the meeting of Pacific leaders that concluded here this weekend. It is a vision that implies tradeoffs and job displacements far more wrenching than any posed by the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the House approved last week after a Herculean display of Presidential persuasion. 
 Underlying Mr. Clinton's approach is a far more subtle appreciation of the realities of economic interdependence than any past American administration has articulated.
Previous presidents have steered clear of the politically uncomfortable fact that Mr. Clinton addressed head-on on Friday: Creating a job for a factory worker in Seattle may first require creating six jobs in Jakarta. The new world order, Mr. Clinton suggested, seamlessly integrates security and economics. Indeed, he touted the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum -- the little-known economic consulting group under whose auspices the Pacific leaders gathered -- as something of a latter-day NATO. He said "our place in the world will be determined as much by the skills of our workers as by the strength of our weapons, as much by our ability to pull down foreign trade barriers as our ability to breach distant ramparts."
In political terms, of course, much of this oratory is about building on Nafta, Mr. Clinton's first big foreign policy win. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said Nafta should be the first out in a "triple play," one that now turns to economic integration of the Pacific and then to tearing down still more trade barriers under a new, much delayed global trade accord, which faces a deadline in mid-December.
Whether he succeeds at that or fails, Mr. Clinton last week became the first President to describe a strategy for the Pacific that truly moves beyond America's huge military presence there. He said Asia's nations "have gone from being dominoes to dynamos," suggesting that America's biggest fear now is that it will be relegated to low-paid guard at the factory gate; Asia's fear, in contrast, is that America's interest will wither as its troops are withdrawn in line with new strategic and economic imperatives.
At the same time, the breadth of Mr. Clinton's vision of a Pacific community -- encompassing Pacific-wide free trade zones and new economic freedoms matched by greater individual freedoms -- clearly left many participants apprehensive. The Indonesians and the Chinese in particular fear an American-dominated organization that will not only present a marketing opportunity but will also pose a political threat.
"Clinton really took everyone by surprise," one of Japan's top industrial planners said. "No one expected such a comprehensive vision, or such lofty goals." Just a year ago, participants noted, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d wrote of the need to preserve the "wheel and spoke" system of alliances in Asia, with the United States at the center.
But that system was collapsing even as Mr. Baker was reinventing it. Years ago it began yielding to a network of relationships that were driven not by government-to-government agreements, the way the European Community was built, but by company-to-company alliances that reached from Tokyo to electronics plants in Thailand and Malaysia, and from Taipei to family-run factories in southern China and Hong Kong.
Those links are now so well established, in a region where America has long under-invested, that Mr. Clinton's new strategy clearly faces major obstacles.
One is that his leverage is limited. A hard truth about economic foreign policy is that there are no aircraft carriers to slip into position to make a point. Ask anyone who has negotiated with Japan over trade in the last 20 years; changing the economic habits of another country is a painstakingly slow business. And when it comes to the key political issue, creating jobs, real policy is often set piecemeal at the corporate level.
"We can put rocks in the stream, but we can't stop the water from flowing around those rocks," Jeffrey Garten, the new Under Secretary of Commerce, said here. "This week in Seattle is about lending some order to international transactions that are growing anyway, but they cannot be stopped."
And increasingly, those transactions undercut efforts to use economics as a foreign-policy lever. Mr. Christopher, defending the decision to sell a supercomputer to the Chinese for the first time since the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989, said on Friday that the United States had to close a $19-billion trade deficit with China. Human-rights symbolism notwithstanding, he said, if we didn't sell the machines, someone else would.
Another challenge is changing the psychology of American business. Ten years of lectures about how Americans must do more to interact with Asian cultures have yet to penetrate very deeply into many American boardrooms. Echoing a Japanese criticism, Mr. Clinton last week castigated American companies for their inward-looking ways.
But one of the politically uncomfortable facts about moving more vigorously into foreign markets is that it frequently requires multimillion-dollar, job-creating investments outside the United States on a scale that would terrify Nafta's opponents.
While no one will say so explicitly, Boeing's decision to build 20 percent of every new 777 jet in Nagoya is part of the quid pro quo to get Japan's big airlines to buy the plane. Boeing acknowledges that such arrangements effectively mean an export of jobs to Asia, but says that on average 85 percent of the content of its planes remains American-made.
"If I don't scratch their industrial itch, Airbus will, or they will do it themselves," says Larry Clarkson, Boeing's top official for international sales. "So far, we have kept them from becoming competitors."

Nafta: The Whys And Wherefores

BYLINE: By David Rosenbaum

 BODY:
IT was one of the most emotional sessions in Congress in years. Partisan loyalties and personal friendships went by the boards. After 13 hours of debate and more than 250 speeches, the House of Representatives voted Wednesday, 234 to 200, to put the North American Free Trade Agreement into effect beginning Jan. 1. David Rosenbaum pulls together a sampler of what was said:
 
"Bill Johnson owns the largest Caterpillar distributorship in the West. There is currently a 20 percent tariff on his products sold in Mexico. Caterpillar has 50 percent of the market. The other half is dominated by Komatsu Company of Japan. Bill says, 'Imagine what will happen when the 20 percent tariff comes off our tractors and it remains on the ones from Japan.' "
-- Jerry Lewis
Republican of California
For the agreement
 
"The Maine footwear industry, the largest in the nation, has lost over 9,000 jobs to countries like Mexico, whose work forces are dominated by low-wage jobs. Similar horror stories can be told about textiles, fisheries and our lumber industry."
-- Olympia J. Snowe
Republican of Maine
Against
 
"Some people may say that I have a democracy fetish. I do not believe that I have one. I think it is irresponsible to enter into a single market with something other than a representative democracy."
-- Lincoln Diaz-Balart
Republican of Florida
Against
 
"I share blood with the Mexican people. And the xenophobic, anti-Mexico slurs that have made the rounds here, including from some Members of the House, I resent that. I resent that very much. . . . We cannot expect to Americanize the world."
-- E. (Kika) de la Garza
Democrat of Texas
For
 
"Hattie Smith worked for U.S. Auto Radiator for 12 years, earning $7.60 an hour. As her last duty before she was fired, Hattie was sent to Mexico to train her 65-cents-an-hour replacements -- 13-year-old girls working without protective gear."
-- William D. Ford

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
After Clinton's Sermon Blacks Are Looking For Action, Not Amens

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Temple Church of God in Christ in Memphis was hot and the 900 people in the pews were sweating. Some 20,000 others were watching on closed circuit television at the downtown convention center. Bill Clinton had come to speak.
The anticipation was almost palpable, and the President did not disappoint. From the pulpit of the historic church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last sermon, Mr. Clinton -- a white man in a church full of black people -- decided to talk about black-on-black crime. 
 Crime, drugs and violence, he said, are destroying the nation. And the ravages of that cycle, he said, are stunting growth, in the black community in particular.
"The freedom to die before you're a teen-ager is not what Martin Luther King lived and died for," he said.
Mr. Clinton was not telling the ministers anything they did not already know, but the President's speech seemed a risky undertaking nevertheless.
Most people are not fond of hearing anyone else detail their shortcomings. And in a society that has been crippled by racial conflict for hundreds of years, his words carried the weight of troubled history, especially when delivered in the cadence of a son of the South.
But Mr. Clinton had calculated the risks. He may care deeply about crime in the cities, but he also knows a political opportunity when he sees one. The Rev. Jesse Jackson has been very vocal on the subject of crime and violence. And members of the Congressional Black Caucus have prodded Mr. Clinton to be more outspoken.
Although he was praised for stepping into the virtually uncharted territory of race and crime, he may have raised expectations beyond his ability to deliver. Crime, like politics, is local. There is only so much a President can do or may be willing to do to turn back a tide that is rooted in joblessness, hopelessness and despair.
Mr. Clinton's aides have said that, for now, he plans to use his office as a bully pulpit to give voice to a painful issue. Many others say that will not be enough.
Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat who has been pressing the Administration to spend more time addressing narcotics and crime, said the speech touched a chord in the black community. "We have not spoken out about the cancers we have in our own bodies," he said. "And all of them weren't planted there by the majority. I would say that 10 years ago we would have run him out of there. But the violence has reached a point where we need help. And jail is not the help we need."
Politics also played a role in Mr. Clinton's calculated risk. Mr. Rangel was told in advance about the speech because White House advisers were trying to win his vote on the hotly contested free trade package. And after the President's speech, Mr. Rangel said, he received a phone call from Ambassador Walter F. Mondale in Tokyo, asking him if the President's impassioned comments did not signal that he deserved support on Nafta.
"I said, 'He made an appeal for Martin Luther King's vote, not mine,' " Mr. Rangel said, chuckling.
Mr. Rangel voted against Nafta. And on crime, he is demanding more than the President is yet willing to commit. He and others are unhappy with the anti-crime bill passed by the Senate last week because it focuses more on punishment than prevention. The bill, which is headed for a conference with the House, calls for $22 billion for more police officers on the streets and more prisons. The Brady bill, which would require a five-day wait for handgun purchases, was derailed by a Republican filibuster.
 
Looking for Solutions
 Mr. Jackson said the President should be assembling solutions including funding for development banks and job training programs and filling vacancies that affect equal employment and civil rights. "The bully pulpit must be preaching policy and plan and priority," he said. "Reagan used the bully pulpit to cut taxes. He didn't just use it to do abstract preaching."
Still, there is relief that Mr. Clinton is talking about the issue at all, which is more than other recent Presidents have been willing to do. Hillary Rodham Clinton said recently that she personally supported Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's proposal to tax ammunition. And in an interview in Rolling Stone, Mr. Clinton suggests that he would support legislation to make it more difficult for gun dealers to get licenses.
He also said he would be interested in supporting a proposal of Senator Herb Kohl of Wisconsin to prohibit gun ownership for people under 18, nationalizing Virginia's law that limits handgun purchases to one a month and banning assault weapons. "People are scared," he said in the magazine interview. "It is very difficult for me to give a speech on the global economy and all my retraining and investment ideas when people don't even think their kids can go to school safely. It is a very basic thing. It unites people across very deep divides."
The polls back Mr. Clinton up.
"Speeches like the one he gave last Saturday are very much out of his soul and his history," said Stanley Greenberg, the President's pollster. But Mr. Greenberg is in a position to know that the President is also responding to polls demonstrating the deep-seated concerns Americans have about crime.
In the latest New York Times/CBS News survey of public opinion, 16 percent cited crime and violence as "the most important problem facing this country today," up from 1 percent when President Clinton was inaugurated in January. That puts it on an equal level with unemployment, jobs, the economy and health care.
If the words Mr. Clinton uttered in Memphis persuaded many, in and beyond the congregation, that he has begun to absorb the size of the task before him, others were waiting to hear more.
If the President is willing to support a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases, why not an outright ban? If he is willing to talk a good game about keeping teen-agers from shooting each other, then is he willing to support significant new spending for job training programs? Paraphrasing scripture in much the same way Mr. Clinton did in Memphis, Mr. Jackson said: "The words must become flesh."

HEADLINE: A Thousand Days and 30 Years;
From Man to Martyr to Myth

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
THIRTY years after John Fitzgerald Kennedy's murder in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963, Americans continue to hold the 35th President in improbably high regard -- not just as a man of star quality, whose life was cut short in a moment whose origins are still debated, but as a national leader ranked in some polls with or above Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Yet John Kennedy's "Thousand Days" in the Presidency were marked less by historic achievements than by continual crises -- the Bay of Pigs fiasco; Berlin; the world's first nuclear confrontation; the beginnings of the war in Vietnam; the heated collisions of white authority and black civil rights demonstrators in the Southern states. Nor were Kennedy's responses always sure. 
 In his last months in office, for example, he concluded the first nuclear test-ban treaty with the Soviet Union. But in his early months he had ordered a massive military buildup that contributed heavily to the Soviet-American arms race. He was reluctant to expend political capital on behalf of black demonstrators, whose persistence made him impatient, and was forced mostly by events into his clashes with Southern recalcitrants like Governors George Wallace of Alabama and Ross Barnett of Mississippi.
The overall record of his Presidency, though in many respects admirable, hardly accounts for Kennedy's high standing three decades later -- a standing all the more unlikely because the years since his death have seen continuing assaults on his personal and political reputations.
His dalliances with women before and during his White House years have become public knowledge. Books like "A Question of Character: A Life of John F. Kennedy" by Thomas C. Reeves and Nigel Hamilton's "J.F.K.: Reckless Youth" have pictured him as privileged, pampered, often irresponsible and insensitive. Inadequately answered charges persist that he and his brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, repeatedly sought the assassination of Fidel Castro. The author Richard Reeves makes it clear in "President Kennedy: Profile in Power" that Kennedy consistently deceived the public about his health, enduring almost constant pain and sometimes resorting to "feel good" injections during his campaign and Presidency.
 
Changes in Atmosphere
 The nation's political and social atmospheres, moreover, have changed greatly since John Kennedy's time. The election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 signaled a national embrace of conservatism after decades of the New Deal liberalism that Kennedy was mistakenly believed to exemplify (his party, save its Southerners, was further to the left than he wanted to be). And the growth of the urban underclass, with the rising incidence of urban crime, has chilled attitudes toward black Americans, with whose improved status the 35th President is indelibly linked.
All this, or less, would have dulled the public's regard for any other former President. How has John F. Kennedy, while not exactly a candidate for Mount Rushmore, prevailed over predictable eclipse? The most important reason, undoubtedly, is the almost mythic manner of his death.
The hero cut down at the height of his glory (though Kennedy was in something of a political slump in the fall of 1963) is a staple of legend-making. And when such a fate befalls a figure of youth and beauty, the legend becomes even more of a romantic drama -- heightened, in Kennedy's case, by the mundane fact that few Americans in 1963 had witnessed, even imagined, the murder of a President.
By then, in fact, the Presidency was an office exalted almost beyond mortality -- by the personality and prominence of Franklin Roosevelt in Depression and war; by Truman's and Eisenhower's cold war leadership of the so-called free world, and by the President's command of nuclear weapons.
As the inheritor of that exalted place, John F. Kennedy became something like a young American emperor: it could hardly be imagined by a fascinated public that he or any President was vulnerable to a human hand. But he was -- a nearly unbelievable fact that spawned dozens of conspiracy theories for a people unable to accept the idea that a deed so momentous did not have equally momentous origins.
The assassination in Dallas, moreover, marked the real arrival of television, history's mightiest conveyor of unforgettable images and moments. Only that autumn, the two major networks, still relatively primitive, had inaugurated 30-minute evening news broadcasts (with John Kennedy the guest star on each program). But from the moment the shots rang out in Dealey Plaza through the funeral services three days later, the networks stayed continuously on the air, steadily focused on the searing drama -- bringing the nation together, as perhaps never before, in its time of shock and grief. Television, blazoning the events of that weekend on the memories of most Americans then living, became the national nervous system.
Kennedy, then in his third year of office, was believed by many to be growing in stature, moving toward a higher statesmanship, an impression since cultivated in the numerous memoirs of his associates. The limited test-ban treaty, concluded only weeks before the fatal shots were fired, seemed ample evidence. So more than a few Americans believe today, some passionately, that a President growing in office would not have taken the nation so deeply into Vietnam as his successor did.
Nor does Vietnam provide the only such wishful idea. Even if Nov. 22, 1963, is taken only as a benchmark in time and what followed a coincidence, it was not long thereafter that things began to go wrong for Americans. The nation's youth began to drop out and turn on, the war in Vietnam became an endless nightmare, cities burned in the "long hot summers" of black revolt, Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King fell before other assassins, world economic supremacy trickled away, crime turned cities into huddles of fear, Watergate destroyed a President and faith in Presidents, hostages and burning helicopters in Iran shattered illusions of American might.
Ironically, all that enhanced the Kennedy legend. Many Americans believed, on faith rather than evidence, that if John Kennedy had not been cut down as he was coming into his prime, if Bobby Kennedy had been there to follow him, these disasters could somehow have been avoided. The worse things seemed to become, the more such Americans missed something they identified with the Kennedy brothers, if in belief rather than fact.
John Kennedy had declared in his inaugural address that "a new generation of Americans, born in this century" had come to power with him. After the stolid years of the 50's and the Eisenhower Administration, the change seemed welcome to that "new generation"; and a third of a century later, in a time of political revulsion, many graying oldsters still mourn a lost leader and the idea of a new age that never came. They will never know if it ever would have.
His most dedicated opponents, moreover, conceded that Kennedy was an engaging man -- not the least of his political assets. His Presidential news conferences were the first to be televised live and regularly, and for millions of viewers they established -- often by the alchemy of "news management" -- his articulatenesshis wit, his sophistication, his apparent mastery of the details of government and diplomacy. No President ever had had the exposure in action that television gave him, and to Americans he became more familiar and recognizable, as have all Presidents since, than the local mayor or Congressman.
Finally, as idolaters often overstate, detractors frequently underrate the Kennedy record in office. It was by no means negligible. He broke, for instance, the centuries-old taboo against a Roman Catholic President, exposing other taboos to the light of reason. He became the first President to call the struggle of American blacks for full equality "a moral issue" -- brave words at the time, earning him a special place in the respect and affection of black Americans.
And though Kennedy's cold warrior inaugural address is more widely quoted, his most memorable words came in the last months of his life, in his speech on June 10, 1963, at American University. He called on the nation, in what was then a risky and challenging change from years of hostility, to re-examine its attitude toward the Soviet Union.
"In the final analysis," he declared, "our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal."
So we all are, as was John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Despite the imperial trappings of the Presidency and his own glittering aura, he knew that well enough. But in the soul-shaking years since his death, as between disillusionment and legend, Americans have chosen legend -- as if to hold in memory their own sense of themselves and their country as they most wished them to be, as they used to believe they were.

HEADLINE: The French, Disneyed and Jurassick, Fear Erosion

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
FOR the French, the dinosaurs were the last straw.
First the Berlin Wall fell, and with it the relevance of the French "force de frappe," or nuclear bomb. Then European unity, the cornerstone of French foreign policy for a decade, disintegrated amid currency turmoil, soaring unemployment and a shaming paralysis before the Balkan war. Then came Mickey Mouse, prompting talk of a "cultural Chernobyl" at Euro Disney. Next GATT -- the onomatepoetic acronym for talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- turned horrible. Finally, those "Jurassic Park" dinosaurs, peering from billboards and merchandised at the 279 McDonald's restaurants in France, rounded out a dim sense that French cultural, commercial and strategic anchors have come unstuck. 
 So it was small comfort for Gallic pride when Euro Disney revealed a disaster this month, announcing losses of $900 million for its first full year of operation and hinting at possible failure. French newspapers took note but nobody crowed. With 11.8 percent of the work force now jobless, another company in trouble was merely more bad news.
The theme park's doldrums are linked more to the European recession and Disney's severe misjudgment of the hotel market than to any visceral incompatibility between Mickey Mouse and the French, although Disney's initial ban on booze and insistence that employees wear "appropriate undergarments" did nothing to mollify an already prickly national sensibility.
That prickliness has been much in evidence of late. The French are going through a bad patch, a recurrence of the intermittent insecurity and questioning that seem to afflict the French soul. Recession and a drumbeat of layoffs from the likes of Michelin and Renault have contributed to this mood. But jobs have been disappearing elsewhere in Europe, too, without producing anything quite like the current French Angst.
Behind the disquiet there lurks that maddeningly vague but pervasive notion that de Gaulle expressed as "une certaine idee de la France." Just what that certain idea is may never be pinned down. But it has a lot to do with a sense of grandeur and civilizing mission as well as a desire to embody intellectual and artistic uplift.
So it is not enough for France to be just another relatively prosperous middle-sized country. It needs a central role, and in projects like the Grand Louvre, completed this week, it has shown that it still has the capacity and imagination to stir international admiration with its public enterprises.
"France needs a 'grand projet' -- an overarching mission," said Jean-Marie Rouart, an author and chief literary critic of Le Figaro. "Napoleon led us across Europe, de Gaulle made us dream, but now we have nothing. Or rather, what we have is American materialism and commercialism as sole world canon."
Because it was perceived as a consummate illustration of this canon, "Jurassic Park" caused a great outburst last month. It was Euro Disney all over again. The dinosaurs were portrayed as monsters intent on gobbling up French culture.
Jacques Toubon, Culture Minister, said the movie illustrated why France must be allowed a "cultural exception" in any new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The exception would allow France to go on subsidizing its cinema and limiting American shows on television. "The alternative," he warned, "is for non-American production to be crushed completely."
Once again, a longing for a different past was evident beneath the surface. Hemingway came to France, as did Fitzgerald and Henry Miller, because inspiration lurked in Paris. Malraux, Gide, Camus, Sartre, Sarraute were international figures. And today?
"There is less and less of France abroad, and more and more that is foreign in France," said Dominique Moisi, deputy director of the French Institute for International Relations. "One minute it's dinosaurs, the next North African immigrants, but it's the same basic anxiety."
That concern -- over a disappearing culture, a lost national identity, an absence of purpose -- also lurks behind all the disputes over grain exports and other agricultural matters that have poisoned the GATT talks. In the French psyche, it is the "paysan," and with him all of rural tradition, that is being threatened by the steamroller of free trade.
But to travel around France today is to see a country that has prospered enormously from open trade and its position as the world's fourth-largest exporter. There is a tremendous gap between the current national anguish and the country's sheer opulence, from the richness of its fields to the elegance of its cities.
That anguish stems from France's intellectual contempt for material values. It wants to stand for an idea; that is the nation's raison d'etre. The idea should be universal -- as Hollywood and Mickey Mouse are today -- but somehow at the opposite end of the moral spectrum from Jurassic Park. But just what that galvanizing idea is escapes the French for now and leaves them waiting morosely for what they see as an ominous millennium.

HEADLINE: Public Colleges Draw More Support As Vital to Train Local Work Force

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Nov. 20

 BODY:
The corporations that began moving to lower Fairfield County a generation ago are paying increasing attention to the quality of the area's public colleges as vital ingredients to the area's economic prosperity.
While New York, with the nation's greatest concentration of Fortune 500 headquarters, has Columbia and New York University among others, lower Fairfield County, which ranks third in Fortune 500 headquarters, has only a commuter branch of the University of Connecticut here and a two-year college, Norwalk Community-Technical College. 
 Those two small colleges, however, are seen as increasingly important to the area's economy's becoming self-sustaining, now that the corporate migration has ended and long-term prosperity appears to depend on smaller businesses that will need a well-educated local population.
 
No Longer Taken for Granted
 After years of being taken for granted, the colleges are being promoted as vital to educating and retraining the county's residents for a rapidly changing workplace. Businesses and corporations are adopting the community college as one of their own. And they are promoting a plan to move the UConn branch to a new campus in downtown Stamford and greatly expand its undergraduate and graduate programs.
The goal, officials say, is not to create a new prestigious institution to compete with traditional four-year colleges, but to serve the hometown needs of the area's businesses and residents, especially adults already in the work force.
"This is part of a broader process of filling in southwestern Connecticut," said Christopher Bruhl, president of the Southwestern Area Commerce and Industry Association. "Just as we are seeing institutions of higher education being strengthened and expanded, we are seeing cultural institutions being created, the child-care network growing, the dramatic upgrading of our hospitals."
Neither college is much older than the county's corporate era. Norwalk Community College and Norwalk State Technical College were founded in 1961 and merged in 1992. The UConn branch opened in 1962 as a feeder for the main campus in Storrs, at the northeastern end of the state.
 
More Business Ties
 For decades, though, the corporate growth had little effect on them. Norwalk Community rented space in a former factory until 1991, when local businesses and politicians finally won a new $23 million campus.
In the 1970's, UConn-Stamford was allowed to offer a few degrees, but it remained isolated on a cramped campus in suburban North Stamford. Finally, in 1990, a local advisory committee recommended an expanded curriculum and a downtown site to the university's Board of Trustees.
The trustees have now authorized $93 million in bonds, and the Legislature has appropriated $10 million to buy a site. Also, the committee estimated that a fund drive could raise $10 million to $15 million more.
The UConn proposal has critics. Professors at Storrs have questioned whether an expanded branch would drain their resources and students. Some students fear their liberal-arts refuge is being captured by downtown business interests.
 
Help for Commuting Students

 Supporters say these concerns miss the point. "The motivation," said the advisory committee's chairman, L. C. Heist, "is more to provide something for the people who are here, and who can't travel great distances, who can't pay for private institutions, who need to work while they're going to school.
"At the moment, if you have a job opening, you can find plenty of people who will come and take it," said Mr. Heist, the president of Champion International Corporation. "Our concern is, are there people in Fairfield County who could take those jobs?"
That concern has also brought growing support to Norwalk Community-Technical, where 80 percent of the 5,100 people enrolled in credit courses are part-time students and where some 4,000 more people take non-credit courses.
Norwalk began wooing employers in the 1980's, offering to train their workers. It provided instructors for subjects like English as a second language and computer use.
 
A Model Contract
 "It's a different world for supervisors today, with discrimination laws, a complex work force and a growing emphasis on self-directed work teams," said Frank Morgan, Norwalk's dean of continuing education. "They were promoted because they were good at their old jobs. They may have no idea how to do their new ones."
What quickly became a model, however, was a contract for the college to provide basic literacy and math classes to several hundred assembly workers at Pitney Bowes.
As Pitney Bowes began making a new generation of computerized mailing machines, it also wanted to replace the traditional assembly line with teams of workers who could make decisions on their own.
On the old line, said Kevin Connolly, the director of manufacturing operations, "I could have done the same thing every day for 20 years, and if the guy next to me and I didn't like each other, we wouldn't say two words all day long. It wasn't necessary."
Now team members would have to talk to each other. They would need new skills, like the ability to read blueprints. But in deciding where to start, Pitney Bowes discovered that 40 percent of the 1,100 workers could not read at a fourth-grade level and that 70 percent lacked math skills.
The company turned to Norwalk Community, and in 1988 27 instructors began literacy and math classes at the factory. Nearly everyone has met the initial goals, and now the college and company are discussing courses to raise reading and writing levels further.
Many employees say the training has made a difference in their personal lives as well. Lula Preci of Fairfield, who has been with Pitney Bowes since 1984, said she both understood and remembered more of what she reads. And she learned how to balance her checkbook.
 
Help for Immigrants
 Antoine Greffard, who came to the United States from Haiti in 1974 and started at Pitney Bowes in 1978, said the literacy classes had improved his spoken English, in part by encouraging him to take out a library card for the first time and read more.
And both Ms. Preci and Mr. Greffard said they were more self-confident. "It's made a difference to me outside of work, because now I'm going to tell you exactly what I'm feeling," Mr. Greffard said.
So far Norwalk has worked with about 25 corporations. The retraining at Pitney Bowes is seen as a model in part because the benefits to both the company and its employees are so obvious. Employers need adaptable employees like Ms. Preci and Mr. Greffard; the workers, in turn, are much more employable.
"In the end," Mr. Bruhl said, "the only thing a company owns is its capacity to innovate, and that comes from people having the training and the skills to change. Your people need to have the lifelong ability to be constantly developed and nurtured and stimulated through education."

HEADLINE: THE PACIFIC SUMMIT: Reporter's Notebook;
Among the Totem Poles, An Unusual Gathering

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLAKE ISLAND, Wash., Nov. 20

 BODY:
The White House wanted this summit conference, the first-ever gathering of the major nations of the Pacific, to look different -- something well beyond the usual guys-in-suits assemblies in formal settings.
What they got, on a raw Puget Sound day, was a cross between Twin Peaks and the Renaissance Weekend-cum-networking retreat that Bill Clinton used to attend on the other coast. 
 It was all sweaters and plaid shirts as the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum gathered inside an Indian long house on this uninhabited island of 475 acres, eight miles from Seattle. Even the Sultan of Brunei, considered the richest man in the world, looked like just another weekender on his Northwest holiday as he entered the long house here with the other world leaders.
The leaders noshed on salmon and blackberry cobbler inside the cedar-planked long house, which served the coastal Salish tribes, on an island where Chief Seattle was born more than 200 years ago.
Surrounded by the ageless glare of Indian totem poles, the leaders put aside the more factious issues of trade, tariffs and human rights to talk about the basic bonds that unite them. That may turn out to be nothing more than the Pacific Ocean, which laps against the most dynamic economic region in the world.
 
Will They Sing 'Kumbaya'?
 "Smooth sailing," Mr. Clinton said as he led the leaders single-file off the passenger ferry Tyee and into the lodge.
"I don't know if they are going to be holding hands and singing 'Kumbaya,' but this is just what the President had in mind," said Lorraine Voles, a White House spokeswoman. "This is all about getting to know each other."
It has been said that people dressed in down coats sometimes look like hand grenades with feet. Bundled against the Puget Sound chill, some of the Asian leaders looked as though they were fresh from an Eddie Bauer catalogue.
Inside the long house, the leaders sat in a semicircle under carved cedar Indian masks and canoe paddles, Mr. Clinton as the leader-moderator.
Business, Mr. Clinton has said with considerable bluntness over these last two days, is really what this get-together is all about. They may have talked about human rights in China, but the real concern is American apples for the Japanese market and Boeing 747's for anyone in the Pacific who needs one.
Mr. Clinton said earlier that he didn't mind being compared to a rug merchant. "I'm not ashamed that I've asked other countries to buy Boeing airplanes," he said.
 
Espresso and Grunge
 From the unrelenting politeness of the natives to the ubiquitous espresso carts, Seattle has been a culture shock to the Asian press and the White House advance team.
Early on in the week, Asian delegates milled around the free espresso offered in the convention center headquarters, befuddled by the array of choices of coffee, a local cliche.
But by Friday, everyone seemed hooked, and a caffeinated quirkiness prevailed. Even the President joined in, ordering, in response to a shout from a cart vendor, a "double shot decaf latte."
Awaiting the arrival of the leaders, foreign journalists could consult one of several "story concierges." But the suggestions that they visit the Microsoft Company Campus, the Boeing factory plant and the Space Needle were not enough. Many reporters wanted to know where they could find "grunge music" and how they could get to Snoqualmie Falls, where the cult international television hit "Twin Peaks" was filmed.
 
Waiting on the Sultan

As the home of Bill Gates, who was listed last year as the wealthiest man in America but has since slipped to No. 2, Seattle has gotten used to can-you-top-this stories about the wealth of the co-founder of Microsoft. But there has been a near frenzy of rumor and office talk about the Sultan of Brunei, whose fortune, estimated at $35 billion, makes him the wealthiest man in the world,
On his latest trip abroad, a visit to Cyprus, he reportedly left a tip of $170,000 with the hotel staff .
When this news hit Seattle several weeks ago, people were flooding the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel with fervid requests to act as bellboy or bellboy's assistant for a day. But the hotel staff has remained intact, and mum.

HEADLINE: THE PACIFIC SUMMIT;
Godfather to Pacific Era? Clinton Succeeds by Merely Getting Asians to Meet

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 20

 BODY:
If Harry S. Truman was the midwife who attended at the birth of new Atlantic institutions such as NATO in the years following victory in World War II, President Clinton pictures himself as the godfather of new linkages in the Pacific in the aftermath of the cold war.
But in the last half-century, Asia has usually been more intractable for the United States than Europe, and this week's pioneering summit meeting of Pacific Rim leaders showed that shaping its future remains difficult.
 
 Mr. Clinton did not stumble here. It was no piddling achievement merely to get the leaders of Indonesia, Taiwan, China, South Korea and other countries together -- something that probably could not have been accomplished as recently as two years ago. In that sense, as Robert E. Rubin, a top presidential economic adviser, put it this week, "The meeting is the message."
"Meeting now and agreeing to meet again suggests the power of the social and economic forces propelling very different societies toward closer association," said Michel Oksenberg, president of the East-West Center in Honolulu. "Those forces are much greater than most of us understand, but it is still very hard to elicit a definitive response from most of these governments and therefore very hard to record measurable progress."
Nowhere more so than in the troubled relationship between Beijing and Washington. Mr. Clinton is touchingly ardent in his efforts to get along with the nation he described here as "home to one of every five people who live on this planet, and the world's fastest-growing major economy." He sees trade with China as a magic elixir that can cure many American economic ills.
But China gave no ground at all on human rights. It provided no fig-leaf to cover President Clinton's nakedness before those in the United States who demand concessions as the price of trade benefits. Indeed, in a press briefing on Friday, Qian Qichen, the Chinese Foreign Minister, stonewalled like a Soviet spokesman of the Brezhnev era. Regarding several of Mr. Clinton's proposed human-rights reforms, he said stolidly, there had been no discussion at all and no need for any, because China's policies were immutable.
It may be true, as Mr. Clinton hinted, that this was just posturing, Chinese-style, for consumption at home. It may be that with the country's paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, in deteriorating health, and with the jostling for succession well under way, no one official can make a commitment, and President Jiang Zemin acted here more as a conduit to his colleagues in Beijing than as a decision-maker.
If so, the real result of the talks between Mr. Jiang and Mr. Clinton, the most significant contact between the two countries since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, may not be known for several days or several weeks. Striking a far more conciliatory note than that struck by his delegation in Seattle, Mr. Jiang told a group of visiting Americans in Beijing last month that he had "every confidence that we will find our way through this."
But it is also true that the Chinese leader failed to follow up his recent promise to give "positive consideration" to permitting envoys of the International Committee of the Red Cross to visit his nation's 3,000 political prisoners. Some Western human rights workers had predicted that Mr. Jiang would announce plans to release some prisoners and to establish legal procedures for the rest to appeal their cases, but as far as is known, he did not.
Indeed, an Asian diplomat who has played a key role in the negotiations here characterized the attitude in the Chinese camp here as "very tough, very unyielding." Without explicitly threatening to leave the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group, he said, the Chinese were saying that nothing would be accomplished until Washington stopped trying to link trade with human rights.
President Clinton tried one small gesture of decoupling, approving the sale to the Chinese of a relatively unsophisticated Cray supercomputer that was previously blocked. But he is committed not to renew special trade benefits, known as most-favored nation status, unless China eases its handling of dissidents. The benefits come up for renewal in June.
At the moment, the advantage appears to lie with the Chinese. Few in Washington think that Mr. Clinton would risk his grand vision for Asia, to say nothing of jeopardizing current trade with China, by withdrawing trade privileges; in fact, some see most favored nation status as the nuclear bomb of the 1990's -- a weapon so fearful that no one dares detonate it.
 
 
Bluff by Christopher?
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher said after Mr. Clinton's meeting with Mr. Jiang that concessions made now and early next year would weigh more heavily in Washington's decision than those made at the 11th hour next May. But that sounded like a bluff. In cold political terms, the Chinese can probably indulge with impunity their predilection for last-minute gestures, because late and well-publicized concessions from Beijing could hardly be met by Washington with a mutually damaging withdrawal of benefits.
The Chinese and other Pacific ministers meeting here this week surprised some of the doubters when they agreed to a common front on the global trade talks, proposing a list of further cuts in tariffs and challenging European participants to get moving. In a region where consensus rather than majority rule is the dominant mode, organizations move at the pace of their most cautious members and such forceful statements are uncommon.
Whether or not the action helps to break the deadlock in the global negotiations, aimed at strengthening the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it was hailed by the Administration as a sign of what can be achieved.
Unfortunately for Mr. Clinton's larger purposes, most of the leaders made abundantly clear their opposition to the early creation of a Pacific free-trade zone, which would include the world's three largest economies, those of the United States, Japan and China, and account for half of the world's gross national product as well as 40 percent of world trade.
Nobuo Matsunaga, Japan's former Ambassador to the United States who is here as his Government's special envoy to the Pacific Rim talks, said that it would take 5 to 10 years for the free-trade idea to mature. The recommendation for a faster pace by the so-called Eminent Persons Group, a panel of private citizens headed by the American economist C. Fred Bergsten, was speedily consigned to the limbo where old position-papers dwell.
"If Mr. Clinton tries to rush us, he will fail, and the whole idea will fail as well," Ambassador Matsunaga said. "He must be patient."

HEADLINE: U.S. Aid Hasn't Stopped Drug Flow From South America, Experts Say

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Nov. 20

 BODY:
It was the summer of 1989, and drug lords were gunning down presidential candidates in Colombia and flooding American cities with cocaine. Declaring that there was "no match for an angry America," President Bush announced that he was expanding the war on drugs.
Though his main pledge was to crack down on street sales, Mr. Bush also asked Congress to increase spending to help cut off the drug supply at its source in Peru, Colombia and Bolivia. 
 Four years and roughly $2 billion later, drug policy experts interviewed throughout the Andes share a conclusion: The flow of drugs from South America to North America has not slowed.
"We haven't had any real impact on the drug flow," one official at the United States Embassy here said. He noted that Peru seized 7 tons of cocaine and cocaine base last year out of an estimated 650 tons produced there. "That's peanuts," he said.
 
Failed Campaigns
 American drug enforcement agents have tried forcible eradication of crops of coca leaf, the essential ingredient of cocaine; substituting other crops for coca; destroying cocaine laboratories, and tightening customs controls on refining chemicals. They have patrolled the skies to interdict flights by drug planes and widened investigations of money laundering by traffickers.
But in a market dictated by supply and demand, the American-financed efforts have at best raised operating costs in a highly profitable business. In one indication that there is no shortage on the streets, the prices and purity levels of illegal drugs sold in the United States have remained relatively stable over the last four years.
Today Washington is sending crossed signals to South America on the future of the drug war. Clinton Administration officials are talking about "tracking down the bees in the hive" and devoting more money to catching cocaine traffickers in the source countries.
"We can't stop our efforts -- that would be to doom a number of these countries to even greater attack by narco-traffickers," said Timothy E. Wirth, a State Department counselor who advises the White House on drug policy.
 
Congress Cuts Funds
 But Congress is cutting aid to Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador for military and police action to block drug shipments by about one third this year, to roughly $90 million. Overall American aid for anti-drug efforts in Peru, Colombia and Bolivia is also declining.
"The Clinton Administration is afraid to say that an international drug war can't work," said Kevin B. Zeese, vice president of the Drugs Policy Foundation, a Washington-based group.
The reaction in the Andean countries has been muted. Many South Americans say their governments joined the so-called drug war only to soothe the United States and were always skeptical that its enforcement strategies would work.
"Drugs are only on the agenda in Peru when Fujimori goes to the U.S. or when Lee Brown comes through Lima," said Roberto Lerner Stein, a local drug expert, referring to Alberto K. Fujimori, the Peruvian President. On the day that Mr. Brown, President Clinton's top drug policy official, visited Lima last August, Peru's Congress approved a bill requiring that convicted traffickers get life sentences.
A case study of the obstacles to enforcement is offered at Santa Lucia, a mountain base in Peru's Huallaga Valley that has cost American taxpayers about $100 million over the last five years. Four years ago, American Embassy officials talked enthusiastically of using Santa Lucia as a base for eradicating coca leaf cultivation in the valley, Peru's prime growing area.
 
Air and Land Attack
 Initially joint teams of Peruvians and Americans descended by helicopter to mountain slopes and attacked fields of coca bushes with weed cutters. But Shining Path guerrillas fired on the helicopters, forcing police officers to abandon the manual eradication exercise.
Then the United States experimented with aerial spraying of herbicides in an attempt to kill the crops. Peru's Government then blocked that move out of fear of driving unemployed and desperate peasants into the ranks of the Shining Path.
Cocaine laboratories and drug planes were the next targets. Guided by American-supplied radar, Peruvian Air Force pilots have shot down or forced down eight small planes used for trafficking this year -- a tiny fraction of the hundreds that are estimated to carry drugs from Peru annually.
And when cocaine trafficking is pressured in one area, it shifts to another. Colombian planes now often fly over Brazil before darting into Peru for pickups.
On the ground, traffickers have shifted refining operations in Peru from enormous factory-size laboratories to mobile, easily concealed jungle labs. To reduce transportation costs, leaders of Colombia's powerful cocaine cartels also increasingly refine cocaine in Bolivia. Cocaine now accounts for two-thirds of Bolivia's drug exports, up from one-third at the start of the drug war.
 
Change of Route
 Police efforts have also prompted traffickers to diversify their export routes. Today the lion's share of South America's cocaine exports slips through countries that are not significant producers, including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela.
On Nov. 6, the Venezuelan police broke up a trafficking ring that was reported to be shipping one ton of Colombian cocaine a month to the United States. Underscoring Venezuela's role as a transit country, United States officials acknowledged on Friday that a C.I.A. anti-drug program there accidently allowed a ton of nearly pure cocaine to be shipped to the United States in 1990.
Similarly, coca leaf cultivation in Peru has shifted out of helicopter range of Santa Lucia, which is in the Upper Huallaga River Valley. Moving into the central and lower valley, about 200,000 farmers now grow coca in an area that was largely rain forest only four years ago. New coca cultivation destroys 500,000 acres of Peru's Amazon rain forest every year, according to Peru's National Institute of Natural Resources, a Government agency.
"You can win in some areas, but then they are replaced by other areas," said Dr. Lerner, a Peruvian psychologist who studies drug issues here. "Supply depends on the consumer market."
Next month American drug advisers are to leave the Santa Lucia base as part of a 50 percent cut in total anti-drug aid to Peru. "By the end of the year we have to wrap it up," said one American official here. "We are already moving out equipment."
 
Peruvian Criticizes U.S.
 Mr. Fujimori, the Peruvian President, has bluntly criticized the Americans' anti-drug strategies. An agronomist by training, Mr. Fujimori has long argued that the best aid would be economic incentives to persuade coca leaf growers move to alternative crops.
"Many people would accept alternative crops, but there are no loans," Mr. Fujimori said in a recent news conference here. "For weapons, there's money. But to develop agriculture, there's no money."
In Colombia, which has the strongest economy of the Andean countries, President Cesar Gaviria recently told President Clinton that Colombia would make up any cuts in American aid from its own budget. One of the American-financed programs, an effort to reform and protect Colombia's judiciary, is highly popular with the public.
But, in Bolivia, the poorest nation of the region, officials warn that American aid is essential for maintaining anti-drug efforts.
Because Bolivian cocaine is also exported to Europe, Bolivia's new Minister of Government, German Quiroga, said in a recent interview that his country would have to turn to countries like France and Germany for help.
American drug enforcement officials interviewed early this month in Bolivia, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela preferred to emphasize individual successes in the anti-drug fight.
They note that Peruvian Air Force planes regularly fire on trafficking planes, sending them crashing into the Amazon jungle. In Colombia, the police have killed or jailed most of the top leaders of the Medellin cocaine cartel. In Bolivia, crop substitution programs have encouraged peasants to eradicate about 20 percent of the nation's coca plants since 1989.
 
Cocaine Still No. 1 Export
 But cocaine powder and semi-refined cocaine remain the largest single export items for Bolivia, Colombia and Peru. In Bolivia and Peru, about 5 percent of the population depend on coca crops as a livelihood. Peruvians grow about two-thirds of the world's coca leaf, a market share that has changed little during four years of the drug war.
"You can't declare war on three million peasants," said Hernando de Soto, who coordinated Peru's anti-drug strategy two years ago. "When I was Peru's drug czar, the only people I could talk to in Washington were cops or people who wanted peasants to raise silkworms."
After years of research, American and Peruvian Governments have failed to come up with a product that competes with coca leaf or with incentives that rival those of the Colombian cocaine cartels.
The cartels often provide agricultural credit. They pick up products at the farm gate. They pay cash. And they circumvent the red tape surrounding legal exports.
 
Little Farm Credit
 In contrast, Peru's cash-strapped Government provides virtually no farm credit. Guerrilla violence has damaged the nation's road and bridge networks to such an extent that Amazon farmers cannot afford to send products to cities like Lima on the Pacific Coast. Bureaucratic demands involving licensing and paperwork close export markets to all but the most sophisticated farmers.
Experts say that hundreds of millions of dollars in aid -- far more than Western nations are willing to provide -- would be needed to develop alternative agricultural programs and transportation systems to get the crops to market.
"In Lima, it is cheaper to import a redwood tree from California than to bring a log from the Amazon," Mr. de Soto said. "The peasants say they want to substitute coca. But to do that you have to create a market environment."
Not only has the coca leaf harvest defied Washington's wishes, but poppy fields are appearing in Colombia and Peru. Virtually unknown to the country five years ago, poppies are now grown on an estimated 75,000 acres in Colombia. Today, Colombia is second only to Burma in production of poppies for heroin.
 
Widespread Corruption
 Official corruption is also a challenge in countries where policemen make $90 a month and judges earn $200 a month. In Peru, 15 policemen were recently jailed on charges of accepting a $100,000 bribe in return for freeing one of the Huallaga Valley's biggest drug traffickers, a Colombian named Waldo Vargas, a day after he was detained in May.
In Colombia, a Deputy Attorney General, Guillermo Villa, was dismissed last month after it was discovered that he was a friend of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, who with his brother, Miguel, controls the country's powerful Cali cocaine cartel.
In Venezuela, President Ramon J. Velasquez nearly resigned this month after he discovered that he had pardoned a major cocaine trafficker. The 78-year-old President maintains that one of his secretaries was to blame for slipping the pardon into a pile of documents awaiting signature. But the police are investigating reports that the family of the trafficker, Larry Tovar Acuna, paid $800,000 to win his release.
Although seizures of drug shipments actually declined throughout the Andes last year, United States officials argue that American aid has strengthened police forces and court systems in South America by fostering an attitude that drug-related payoffs are still scandalous.
"We have prevented the country from falling into the hands of the 'narcos,' " a United States Embassy official said in Bolivia. "If we leave Bolivia, corruption will go to all levels."

HEADLINE: Senators in Nigeria Balk at Military Takeover

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LAGOS, Nov. 20

 BODY:
In one of the first signs of open opposition to the Nigeria's new military ruler, 67 elected senators vowed today not to surrender their seats in the federal legislature, which has been dissolved. But they did not say how they would resist the new military government.
"The military must know that they are not armed to treat Nigerians and Nigeria like a conquered people and an occupied territory," the senators said in a statement. It was a rare show of unity for a chamber that had been sharply divided during the political crisis, which began with the nullification of the June 12 presidential election. The statement was issued after the senators were ejected from government-paid hotel rooms in Abuja, the capital. 
 "Every military administration justifies its takeover with claims to have the ability to clean up the society, but ends up being more corrupt than the preceding one," the statement said.
On Wednesday, Gen. Sani Abacha, the Defense Minister, ousted the interim civilian government of Ernest Shonekan. The next day he dissolved the federal legislature, the 30 state governments and all local councils, and also banned political activity. He promised to institute a new democratic system, but did not say when.
Nigeria was plunged into chaos when Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, who spent eight years promising a return to an elected civilian government, nullified the results of the June election.
The apparent winner of that vote, Moshood Abiola, in his first remarks since General Abacha's takeover, said today that he would have to consult with his advisers before deciding what action to take.
After canceling the results of the presidential election, General Babangida resigned under pressure and named Mr. Shonekan to succeed him. General Abacha said he was ousting Mr. Shonekan and dismantling democratic institutions to better deal with Nigeria's worsening economic woes and widespread civil unrest.
Nigeria has been in the grip of a nationwide general strike called to protest a sharp fuel price increase Mr. Shonekan imposed two weeks ago. Today, labor leaders met with the new government labor director, but Adamo Oshimole, deputy director of the National Labor Congress, said the government had spurned their demand to scale back the price increase.
General Abacha, who received military training from the United States and who helped lead coups in 1983 and 1985, met in Lagos today with the Ambassadors from the United States, France and Britain. A spokesman for the general said the talks were "frank and cordial." There was no immediate comment from the ambassadors.

HEADLINE: THE PACIFIC SUMMIT;
BOYCOTT IN ORDER, MALAYSIAN SAYS

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Nov. 20

 BODY:
As President Clinton played host this weekend to Government leaders from across Asia, one Prime Minister who declined his invitation to Seattle, Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, was pleased that he stayed home.
Prime Minister Mahathir, who is known here for his caustic anti-Western oratory and for his well-honed sense of political theater, insisted again today that he made the right decision in boycotting the summit meeting. 
 "I have no regrets," he told reporters in Kuala Lumpur, the futuristic capital of a nation that during his 13 years in office has been transformed into an economic dynamo. "I'm happy to be here."
He said that there were important reasons for his decision to reject President Clinton's invitation. The Prime Minister said that he was disappointed before the summit meeting by the cool response of the United States and other nations to an Asians-only economic grouping that he has championed.
 
A Publicity Bonus
 And was it also possible, he was asked, that by boycotting the Seattle meeting there was a publicity bonus for Malaysia, which otherwise might have been ignored at the summit?
"There is something to be said about that," Prime Minister Mahathir conceded, a large grin on his face as he explained his theory that it can be better for the leader of a small nation to be notorious than to be anonymous.
"When a country is doing well, is peaceful, nobody is interested," he said. "Perhaps you have to thumb your nose at people before they notice you. Perhaps that may be a strategy we will follow. We should arrest a few foreign journalists -- then we'll be noticed." He laughed again.
During Dr. Mahathir's tenure, Malaysia has produced prosperity where a generation ago there was only poverty. While the per capita income in Malaysia is only about $3,000 a year, it is growing rapidly. The economy has expanded at a rate of more than 8 percent in each of the last five years.
But freedom is limited here and the judicial system is often criticized by international human rights groups. The Government tolerates little dissent, and news organizations are timid in their coverage of government affairs.
 
Notorious Drug Laws
 Outside Asia, Malaysia has probably gained more notoriety for its drug laws -- which require the death penalty for trafficking in small amounts of narcotics, even when the accused are Western tourists -- than for anything else.
Within Asia at least, Dr. Mahathir -- he was educated as a physician -- should have no concerns about being noticed.
The influence of the 68-year-old leader in Southeast Asia is out of proportion to Malaysia's population of only 18 million people. "He might be willing to offend Western diplomats, but you'd never see him be rude to a Western businessman," said an American diplomat. "He understands the value of foreign investment and free markets."
Dr. Mahathir said today that he might have attended the Seattle meeting had there been more support from the West for the East Asian Economic Caucus, the all-Asian economic grouping that he devised three years ago.
He has promoted the caucus, which exists now as little more than a name, as a counterweight to the European Community and to efforts among the nations of North America to lower regional trade barriers.
The United States and other Western nations have sought to block the creation of a powerful East Asian economic group out of fear that it could become a trade bloc that would shut out Western powers.
While Prime Minister Mahathir has praised the Clinton Administration as "more accommodating" than the Bush Administration in its approach to Asia, he said today that he still feared Western powers were turning their foreign policies toward Asia "merely in order to have a share of the economic dynamism and the market potential."
"They should be focusing on Asia because Asia is an important part of the world," he said.

HEADLINE: Outlook for Cuba Grim, Study for State Dept. Says

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 20

 BODY:
A new report on Cuba paints a grim picture of the island's future, saying that attempts at economic reform now under way will probably lead to civil strife before the end of the decade.
The report, which was commissioned by the State Department, says President Fidel Castro and Cuba's Communist Party leadership are attempting limited free-market reforms modeled after those undertaken in China. It concludes, however, that a number of factors, from Mr. Castro's highly centralized rule to a reluctance by the Communist leadership to unleash market forces "will deny Cuba the economic benefits of the China scenario." 
 The 674 page report, titled "Transition in Cuba, New Challenges for U.S. Policy," is the product of nearly two years of work by a team of 17 academics. It was produced under the supervision of Lisandro Perez, a specialist in Cuban affairs at Florida International University in Miami.
Cuba's economy has stumbled badly since the demise of the former Soviet Union two years ago, shrinking more than half by some estimates. Hoping to arrest that decline, Havana has accelerated the pace of its own economic reforms, allowing citizens to form small private businesses, legally possess foreign currency and form their own agricultural cooperatives.
"Cuba's future will be grim, no matter what is the name of its ruler or the form of its political regime," the report says. "The most optimistic conclusions set the date for an appreciably more liberal, more democratic, and more prosperous Cuba no sooner than the beginning of the millennium."
In what the report describes as the two most likely scenarios for Cuba's immediate future, the island's leadership, unwilling to undertake bolder political and economic reforms for fear they would threaten their hold on power, will attempt to muddle through the present crisis, tinkering around the edges of a collapsing system.
In the first scenario, the Government faces a challenge, such as a coup attempt or food riots, perhaps as early as next year, and is able to survive.
The repressive measures needed to put down the challenge, however, spark civil conflict that quickly draws the involvement of the large Cuban American community in Florida. As the strife spreads, the report says, the United States may feel obliged to become militarily involved to help end the crisis and remove the Castro Government.
Under the second scenario, the Castro Government is able to hang on until late in the decade, but at the cost of continued economic deterioration and social decay. When challenged domestically, what would by then be a much weaker government collapses, much as happened in some of the countries of Eastern Europe.
"All the evidence available to us suggests that the willingness to undertake bold reforms is lacking," said Jorge Dominguez, a Harvard University professor who directed the political analyses in the report. "You have the possibility of a riot over food or an immigration crisis some time in the near future, or things could drag on for a while until the economy is gone, there is no more respect for the law and things just begin to collapse."
Another scenario, considered less likely, includes an attempt to follow the example of the ruling party of Mexico, which has opened its economy and allowed a limited form of political pluralism but manipulated the system to retain control.
Dissenting scholars of Cuban affairs say that while the country's situation is dire, it is by no means a foregone conclusion that the island's economic reforms are doomed to failure, or that its economy cannot be revived.
"A lot of what will determine the success of the China model is external to Cuba," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economist at Smith College. "What will the United States' European allies policies be toward the American embargo, which many find distasteful? How much oil will the Cubans discover? What will be the price of nickel in five years?
"I don't see any kind of economic miracle in the making," he added, "but the Cubans have enough balloons in the air so that some of them might fructify and create some strength."

HEADLINE: Rabies Fear Is the Latest Barrier to Deer Hunting

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANCRAM, N.Y., Nov. 19

 BODY:
For the first time in 20 years, Brian Yorck will not get up before dawn on Monday to go out hunting on the opening day of the deer season in southern New York State.
"My concern is the rabies problem," he said. 
 Although the number of rabid deer is relatively small -- only 13 confirmed cases in a deer population of almost a million -- some hunters like Mr. Yorck think there is no point in taking a chance.
The State Department of Environmental Conservation shares that concern -- to the point of issuing guidelines on how to handle carcasses for the tens of thousands of hunters who will be in the field for food or sport or camaraderie from Monday through Dec. 14.
 
Hunters Are Declining
 But the department, which regulates hunting in the state, is more worried about long-term trends like a continuing decline in hunters and a rapid growth in the deer population. That has both environmental and economic implications in a state where hunters contribute an estimated $100 million a year to the economy.
"Kids in their formative years are spending their time in malls, not in the woods," said Ed Feldman, an official in the state's Bureau of Fish and Wildlife.
The total number of licenses to hunt deer fell from 811,000 in 1985 to 694,000 in 1992, according to the state's big-game experts. This year's figures are not yet available.
The decline in hunting in New York State reflects a national trend, according to three researchers at Cornell University.
 
The Future Looks Bleak
 "The future of hunting looks bleak, given social values coupled with recent and projected trends in American demographics," said the researchers, Daniel J. Decker, Jody W. Enck and Tommy L. Brown, members of the Human Dimensions Research Unit of the Department of Natural Resources at Cornell.
The wildlife experts said hunting was declining for reasons as varied as a rise in single-parent families, with fewer opportunities for children to learn hunting from their fathers, and a decrease in land available for hunting because many property owners don't allow it.
In addition, the Cornell researchers quoted other studies reporting that many Americans feel killing animals for pleasure, male bonding, tradition or food is "simply inappropriate" in modern society.
Coincident with the decline in hunting has been an increase in the deer population of New York and other states to the point where deer are considered pests in many areas.
 
Mild Winters Cited
 James Glidden, head of the state's Big Game Unit, said the decline in hunting only partly explains the population rise. More important, he said, was a series of mild winters and a return of many farm fields to young forest growth that provides an ideal habitat for deer.
As a result, the statewide size of the deer herd has climbed to almost a million, up from 450,000 in 1978, too many for the natural range to support.
In their quest for food, hungry deer have invaded farmers' fields and suburban lawns as far south as Westchester County to eat shrubs near houses.
"They have reached the limit of toleration," said Glenn Cole, head of the conservation department's wildlife unit at New Paltz. "And the herd is getting bigger."
 
Females Are the Key
 Because controlling female deers is key to controlling the population, the state issues special permits for licensed hunters to shoot an antlerless deer in addition to a buck.
Last year, a record number of deer were killed -- 118,000 bucks and 115,000 does and fawns. Although the total of 233,000 was up from 213,000 the year before, it was not enough to cope with the increase in the deer population.
Of the deers killed last year, 64,000 were female adults, less than the department's target of 70,000. This year, it issued more special permits than ever before, with a target of 71,200 does.
But the 1993 hunting picture is clouded by the fear of rabies.
"Most hunters will never see a rabid deer," the department said.
Nonetheless, it issued guidelines for the safe handling of carcasses and recommended that venison be cooked at least to 140 degrees Fahrenheit to kill any bacteria or viruses that might be present.
"The likelihood of contracting rabies from deer is very slim," Mr. Cole said. "But some people are concerned and may not hunt. It could affect the take."

News, News And More For the Irish

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
THERE are times when the patriot's game can seem confounding, even ludicrous, as with the $7.4 million Brink's robbery in which Federal agents have suddenly netted a veritable Sean O'Casey farce of circumstance and suspects: Bags of money scattered about a dim tenement apartment; an Irish revolutionary hiding out in America as a comic book dealer in Queens; an Irish-American cop -- long the New World role model for the Irish people -- arrested as a worker at the plundered Brink's depot, and a classically ascetic Irish priest, beloved as "Father Pat" who toiled for decades among the least of our urban brethren down in the Lower East Side, arrested as a principal in the outsized caper.
All have denied the charge of being found in possession of bags of the stolen fortune, let alone actually stealing it. But with the great playwright O'Casey dead and buried there's no witty way to be imagined out of all this, only the plodding process of criminal justice. 
 "Hollywood couldn't have done it better," says Brian Rohan, who scooped the city last week in the Irish Voice with an exclusive interview with the Rev. Patrick Moloney proclaiming his innocence from his holding cell, before the priest made bail. "Father Pat's a great guy, a sweet guy, but I would have a problem putting him in charge of tonight's dinner, let alone a Brink's heist," says Mr. Rohan, who, as a ubiquitous reporter in the city's resurgent Irish community, fairly summarizes the general puzzlement and wariness at this story.
No one loves an odd tale that shreds a few of life's cliches more than the Irish do; they specialize in this to the point of having co-opted the English language of their colonial occupiers and reforged it into a blazing Irish art. But this story of Father Pat has some unpromising edges, not the least of which is the suspicion, far from proven, that much of the Brink's loot might have been intended for the Irish Republican Army's continuing guerrilla war against the British presence in Northern Ireland.
The I.R.A. itself and official supporters of the reunification cause in this country have quickly, angrily denied all such suspicions. To be found looting this land of traditional sanctuary would risk perverting decades of tolerance here for the long-running cause of Irish nationalism. It would be more Realpolitik debacle than O'Casey farce. And this at a time of considerably renewed interest in the cause among the flow of ever-arriving young Irish immigrants.
Most usually pay little attention to the Northern troubles as they grow up in the Southern republic and face its overwhelming economic problems and the bittersweet choice to emigrate. Once in New York, many look back if not in anger, then in greater need of detail about their larger Irish history. Thus hundreds of them, bolstered by older generations of Irish-Americans, held a surprisingly large demonstration recently outside the British consulate to contend that the London Government has been half-hearted about a promising new peace initiative under way lately in the North.
For all the interest in the Father Pat story, it still had to share even greater front-page space in the city's Irish newspapers last week with the peace initiative's developments. Non-Irish just tuning in for the priest's tale could read all about the considerable controversy generated by President Clinton again barring a visa for Gerry Adams. He is the leader of Sinn Finn, the political arm of the I.R.A., and is deeply involved in the peace talks as an articulate yet enigmatic man who denies the White House charge that he also takes part in the I.R.A.'s more violent stratagems.
"I don't think the Empire State Building will crumble if Gerry Adams is let in," was the visitor's observation from Boston of Tim Pat Coogan, an eminent Irish journalist who is a cold-eyed expert on I.R.A. history.
Barred visas, fragile peace hopes, agonizing death of innocents back home: That's the traditional Irish-American story, of course, not this odd tale of Father Pat and the Brink's heist. Resourceful as all other city newcomers chafing at the hyphen in their status, the Irish fortunately topped all of the above for sheer storytelling dynamics by the end of the week with the exciting tale of Jack's Lads. That's the popular nickname of the Irish republic's soccer team, which narrowly avoided playoff elimination to qualify for a greatly coveted place in the 1994 World Cup tournament to be held in the United States.
To qualify, Jack's Lads, ranked 11th in the world, barely managed a tie with the lower rated Northern Irish team in a peaceful, sporting game that mixed Irish and British players in as poetic a form of good news imaginable for the city's Irish community. Jack's Lads will be coming, in person, not merely through the dish antennas dotting the city's pub tops. What a relief from this business about stolen millions and aberrational Irishness.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Opening

 BODY:
Nervous commentators fear that North Korea is about to develop nuclear weapons, leading them to urge immediate sanctions or even bombing raids to take out the regime's nuclear facilities. But President Clinton is adopting a sound diplomatic strategy for coaxing North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions.
The U.S. and South Korea will cancel the provocative Team Spirit military exercises they conduct annually if North Korea opens its nuclear sites to regular inspection and resumes talks with South Korea. That could set the stage for trading U.S. diplomatic recognition for a verifiable end to North Korea's nuclear program -- which in turn could lead to aid and investment from abroad. 
 North Korea has said it will resolve the nuclear issue if the U.S. takes steps to "renounce its nuclear threat" -- a veiled reference to Team Spirit. Mr. Clinton is offering the opening Pyongyang has long sought. Now it must live up to its word.
North Korea signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty in 1985. But it did not allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect its nuclear facilities until 1992, after the U.S. withdrew its nuclear warheads from South Korea. North and South Korea also agreed to ban reprocessing of plutonium on the peninsula. Such reprocessing is needed to convert spent nuclear reactor fuel into weapons-grade plutonium.
But North Korea has never agreed to arrangements to verify the North-South accord. And when I.A.E.A. inspectors turned up evidence that the North's reactor may have been operating longer -- and produced more spent fuel -- than the North had said, Pyongyang barred special inspections of its nuclear waste sites that could have helped clear up the discrepancy. It also suspended regular inspections, claiming that the I.A.E.A. was being unfair and that the U.S. and South Korea were still making nuclear threats.
These actions immediately raised suspicions that North Korea was stalling inspections while it rushed ahead with bomb-making. But there is no evidence that its reprocessing plant has begun operating. Its backtracking may have been just a bargaining tactic to get the best deal for giving up its nuclear program. Mr. Clinton's diplomacy will test that proposition.
Impatient hawks have urged tougher measures, like bombing North Korea's nuclear facilities. But U.S. intelligence suspects the North may have secret sites. If so, they cannot be targeted.
Others urge immediate imposition of sanctions by the United Nations. While North Korea's economy is one of the most self-sufficient in the world, it does depend on imported oil for 10 percent of its energy needs. An oil cutoff would require cooperation from China both in the Security Council and on its border with North Korea.
But neither Beijing nor Seoul wants to see North Korea collapse, sending refugees or its army spilling across their borders. So sanctions will be applied only as a last resort.
That's why Mr. Clinton is rightly resisting pressure to get tough with Pyongyang. Instead, he's taking a calculated political risk that the North means what it says. But Pyongyang should not be under any illusion: if it continues to balk, tougher measures are sure to follow.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Offers Chance to Export Our Ideals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"This country's greatness was not built on cheap labor," Representative Richard A. Gephardt stated in the waning hours of the debate on the North American Free Trade Agreement. That statement does a disservice to the working people of this country and to history.
This country was most definitely built on cheap labor. From African slave laborers to indentured servants, convicts, children, Chinese chain gangs, Irish labor camps, lofts of Eastern European Jews and more, the great expansion and consolidation of this country's land holdings and economy were built on the cheapest labor available and paid for by trading fear for hope and the workers' present for their children's future. 
 Mr. Gephardt's complaints of Mexican labor and labor laws could have been made against United States labor and labor laws in this century, when wages were criminally low, workplaces were treacherous and often deadly, and unions were illegal.
Since World War II, workers have watched their increasingly bloated union leadership, Mr. Gephardt's allies, bargain away thousands of jobs in collusion with increasingly bloated corporate leadership.
Some American jobs have been going and will continue to go to Mexico, free trade agreement or no, and it is cynicism for Mr. Gephardt to allow his supporters to believe otherwise.
Now that the North American Free Trade Agreement has passed, Mr. Gephardt and his cronies owe it to those he claims to represent to take advantage of what may be gained. Lane Kirkland of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. has vowed not to forget those who voted in favor of the trade agreement. He should stop wasting his members' pension money on this selfish vendetta; there is more on the line than his machismo. In addition to the goods, services and foodstuffs that we can export to Mexico and the rest of the world, we should be exporting our principles of government and trade unionism.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Offers Chance to Export Our Ideals;
Nothing for Labor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Gary Hufbauer's attack on the A.F.L.-C.I.O. for opposing the North American Free Trade Agreement (Op-Ed, Nov. 15) distorts organized labor's position on global trade. 
The labor movement fought for strong side agreements, including labor, social and environmental standards. That's not what we got. The Congressional strategy to pass the trade agreement depended on strong pro-business Republican support and maintaining the support of the authoritarian Salinas regime in Mexico. Both of these precluded side agreements that could protect workers in the United States and Mexico.
Also, there are countless examples of United States corporations already taking advantage of the low wages in Mexico to relocate there and to ratchet down United States wages and working conditions by threatening workers in this country with job loss.
Our union will continue to argue for a trading policy based on a high-wage strategy that takes advantage of the productivity of United States workers. The free trade agreement is not the answer to our economic problems.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact Offers Chance to Export Our Ideals;
Nothing for the Poor

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am disappointed that your Nov. 16 editorial implied I would vote against the North American Free Trade Agreement because I am running scared. It is hard to believe you could conclude that the approximately $60,000 I received from labor political action committees each election cycle, less than 25 percent of my contributions, would sway my decision. Especially when my constituents have never given me less than 80 percent of their support in the last 20 years. 
 I believe that the North American Free Trade Agreement is an important move toward free trade. It will accomplish its goals. The economy of all of North America will improve with new jobs in all three countries.
There is no question that some American jobs will be lost. But, unlike organized labor, I believe that in any event many of these jobs will be lost in time. While I regret acceleration of the loss, that is not enough reason for me to oppose the trade agreement.
I opposed the free trade agreement because not enough is being done to make sure that all Americans will be able to take advantage of the new jobs it will create. There are in this country too many people who are without education and training to qualify for these new opportunities. They are the people living in poverty and surrounded by despair and drugs.
Until I see an effort to make it possible for the poor of this country to share in the bounty I will oppose the North American Free Trade Agreement.

HEADLINE: Without Earlier Drama, Trade Accord Is Passed

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
With little of the drama or emotion that characterized the debate in the House on Wednesday, the Senate gave final Congressional approval tonight to the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Under the accord, tariffs and other trade barriers between the United States, Canada and Mexico will be gradually removed beginning on Jan. 1, creating the largest free-trade zone in the world. 
 The Senate approved the legislation to put the accord into effect by a vote of 61 to 38. Politically, it was the most important issue of the year for President Clinton and Congress. But passage in the Senate was never in doubt, the way it had been in the House, where it passed on Wednesday by a vote of 234 to 200.
As was the case in the House, party loyalty in the Senate was abandoned and the President prevailed on the strength of Republican support. Voting for the measure were 27 Democrats and 34 Republicans. Voting against it were 28 Democrats and 10 Republicans.
 
Hope for an Expanded Market
 "I do not believe that this Nafta is necessarily going to produce jobs immediately," said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, "but it offers the hope that an expanded market will expand employment in our country."
Taking a different view was Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, who said, "If we do not lose jobs, which we will, it certainly will have a depressing effect on the wage structure in this country."
The trade measure created some unusual alliances. The Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, and the Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, supported the legislation. Senators Carol Moseley Braun, Democrat of Illinois, and Jesse A. Helms, Republican of North Carolina, were joined in opposition.
 
A 15-Pound Agreement
 The outcome tonight did not turn on the arcane provisions of the 15-pound agreement, which would abolish some tariffs immediately and phase out others over 5, 10 or 15 years.
Nor did it really turn on the question of jobs. Depending on whether the projections of proponents or opponents are right, the accord will either lead to a few hundred thousand net new jobs in the United States or cost the country a few hundred thousand jobs. In either case, that is insignificant to an economy with about 120 million workers.
But the trade pact came to stand for the economic changes that are sweeping the country in the aftermath of the cold war: more demand for American products abroad and for foreign goods here; the shrinking military industries; ever fewer blue-collar jobs, and increased opportunities for workers who are highly educated and masters of new technology.
Those changes are promising to many Americans but frightening to many others. Businesses seeking new markets for their exports were strong supporters of the accord. Labor unions were vigorously opposed.

GRAPHIC: Graph: "The Trade Pact at a Glance"
 
THE NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT would bind the economies of Canada, Mexico and the United States. It would take effect on Jan. 1, 1994, and would eliminate various taxes and rules to allow goods and services to be sold freely from the Arctic to Acapulco. Because the United States and Canada entered into a free-trade agreement on Jan. 1, 1989, the North American pact would mainly affect trade between Mexico and the United States and between Mexico and Canada.
 
HOW THE DRAFT CHANGED: The Clinton Administration negotiated two side agreements and several special deals benefiting United States industrial and agricultural interests as various as sugar beet and orange juice producers and makers of household appliances. The three countries agreed to cooperate in monitoring environmental abuses; they also agreed to a process for investigating of labor abuses, a compromise union leaders found too weak.
 
WHAT IT ISN'T: The free-trade zone created by the agreement would not involve common tariffs and other trade barriers toward the rest of the world. Nor would it include efforts to combine currencies, welfare programs and immigration policies.
 
THE KEY: Tariffs: Taxes that the Federal Government collects on goods from other countries. The agreement would phase out tariffs immediately or, in some cases, over 5, 10 or 15 years. Mexican tariffs on American goods average 10 percent.
 
AFFECTED INDUSTRIES
 
Agriculture: The United States and Mexico would eliminate 57 percent of their trade barriers immediately, the rest over 15 years.
 
Auto makers: Would eliminate or cut tariffs on vehicles assembled in each country. Mexico would eliminate import quotas on automobiles.
 
Banks and brokerages: Mexico would virtually dismantle its ban on American banks, and American securities firms would be allowed to increase their investment in the Mexican market.
 
Textiles: Would eliminate many Mexican tariffs immediately and American and Canadian tariffs of up to 30 percent over 10 years.
 
Energy: American drilling companies would be allowed to share in profits from oil strikes in Mexico.
 
Trucking: Mexican and American truck drivers would be allowed to drive their rigs in each other's countries by the end of the century.

HEADLINE: TRADE VOTE EFFECT MAY EBB OVER TIME

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Of all the politicians who President Clinton said had "put their political careers on the line" in voting for the North American Free Trade Agreement, Representative Sam Farr could have topped the list.
Mr. Farr, a Democrat from Carmel, Calif., is a newcomer to Congress who barely made it in the first place. He had to fight off more than two dozen rivals in a primary before winning a special election in June. 
 And, because he reneged this week on his campaign pledge to oppose the trade accord, unions that were critical to his victory are now offering to mount an all-out effort in 1994 to help Bill Monning, a Democrat who was Mr. Farr's closest rival in the open primary, challenge Mr. Farr.
But Mr. Monning is not sure he wants to take on Mr. Farr again. "The question I would raise, hypothetically, is, three months from now, how much of the electorate is going to remember the Nafta vote?" he asked.
 
Political Bravado
 For all the cries of betrayal from the unions, for Ross Perot's chest-beating threats that "we'll remember in November," and for all of Mr. Clinton's bravado about political courage, it is by no means certain that many lawmakers who voted for the pact will be turned out by the voters.
Despite the bare-knuckle politics in Washington over trade, the voting public has not seemed deeply moved. Since the battles were more within the parties than between Democrats and Republicans, it may be that only in the closest races, particularly primaries, that the influence of labor or of backers of Mr. Perot might make a difference.
"We'll have two lifetimes in politics between now and the election," Vice President Al Gore said in an interview. "Those who are angry about the vote today may themselves feel differently after a few months."
 
Playing Down Fears
 Representative Bill Paxon of upstate New York, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, played down the notion that supporters of the pact are frightened. "Most members take the view that there's a lot of water to go over the dam between now and next November," he said.
The greater impact may be in 1996. Two opponents of the agreement, Mr. Perot and Patrick J. Buchanan, who sought the Republican nomination last year, might be emboldened by polls showing support for the pact has diminished with some Republican voters.
On the Democratic side, the fight has torn the party's traditional coalition, perhaps leaving Mr. Clinton more open to a challenge from the left in the 1996 primaries. An analysis of the House vote by the Economic Policy Institute, a union-backed research group, found that by supporting the agreement Mr. Clinton "has alienated his base, including voters in the suburbs, in the middle class and in swing states."
 
Reassuring Lawmakers
 But the President's immediate political concern is reassuring lawmakers who voted with him that he will do what he can to help them next year. In a letter he signed Wednesday night to each of the 234 Democrats and Republicans who voted for the agreement, Mr. Clinton wrote, "The historic nature of Nafta and the intense feelings on both sides of the issue and on both sides of the aisle mean it would be best for the House and for our political system if this issue were not re-fought in the 1994 Congressional elections."
Rather than debating the trade accord itself in next year's race, it may be more likely that candidates will use it to make other points. Mr. Perot, for one, is already stirring up anti-Government sentiment among his supporters by citing the deal-making that led to the agreement's passage. The biggest fear for Democrats is that their challengers would blame the trade pact for anything bad that happens in a district.
Knowing that unions can carry their influence only so far, some labor officials said they want to focus on defeating a few vulnerable incumbents, like Mr. Farr. "It's disturbing," the congressman said of such plans. "I've been in the California legislature and had a 94 percent voting record for labor."
 
White House Help
 Mr. Farr, who said he voted for the agreement because he had concluded that it would ultimately lead to more jobs for his district on the central California coast, said that Robert Reich, the Labor Secretary, had agreed to come to the district to explain the pact to labor and business groups. "There's an open door to the White House if you ask for assistance," said Mr. Farr, whose predecessor, Leon E. Panetta, is the Federal budget director.
While Mr. Farr gotabout a third of his campaign contributions from labor groups he still could be formidable, because he can now count on big donations from political action committees tied to business.
 
Leaning on the PAC's
 That weighs on the mind of Mr. Monning, a lawyer in Salinas, Calif. "Clinton and Panetta will probably make up the difference, in terms of leaning on those PAC's that wanted Nafta," he said.
Rex Hardesty, a spokesman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., agreed that the financial clout of unions can easily be countered by business groups. But he warned against underestimating the unions. "They're not factoring in the 'we'll go fishing, we'll sit on our hands' quotient," he said. "There's no way to quantify what it costs to a candidate when labor sits on its hands."

HEADLINE: SENATE CONFIRMS A SCIENCES CHIEF

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Slipping in a vote between more fractious issues like gun control and trade treaties, the Senate early this morning confirmed Dr. Harold E. Varmus, a Nobel laureate, as leader of the country's most prominent biomedical research organization, the National Institutes of Health.
Dr. Varmus, a professor of microbiology and biochemistry at the University of California at San Francisco, is internationally renowned for his work on the genes that cause cancer, the devious mechanisms of viruses and other basic puzzles of biology. 
 He takes over as director from Dr. Ruth Kirschstein, who will stay on as Deputy Director. Dr. Kirschstein has been the interim head of the institutes since the departure of Dr. Bernadine Healy, who resigned in June after persistent complaints from politicians and scientists about her argumentative style and her awkward handling of investigations into scientific fraud.
 
Overseeing $11 Billion Budget
 In assuming the post, Dr. Varmus, 53, will command a sprawling operation with an $11 billion annual budget that finances most of the biomedical research carried out at universities and companies around the nation.
The largely administrative job is a big shift for Dr. Varmus, who has spent most of his career in a laboratory. But he has served on many policy-making panels over the years.
Dr. Varmus said in an interview today that he learned of his confirmation after returning from a late-night showing of "The Remains of the Day," a movie based on the elegantly precise novel by Kazuo Ishiguro.
Dr. Varmus has an unusual background for a scientist of his stature, having earned his bachelor's degree in English from Amherst College and a master's in English literature from Harvard University. He went on to earn a medical degree from Columbia University and did post-doctoral training at the National Institutes of Health.
Researchers are elated to see one of their own take the helm of the Government body that feeds them. N.I.H. directors generally have been clinicians rather than pure scientists. "We in the trenches are really optimistic," said Dr. Jeff Boyd, head of the gynecological pathobiology group at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, one of the 18 institutes that make up the N.I.H. "I've been here for 17 years, and I must say this level of excitement has not existed before."
 
Candidate of Clarity
 Dr. Samuel Broder, director of the National Cancer Institute, said: "Appointing Harold Varmus as Director provides an unmistakable signal that we will have a strong basic research agenda. He's not a compromise candidate. He's a candidate of crystalline clarity. He'll have enormous credibility, and credibility is everything in this town."
But if credibility is everything, it is not the only thing. Dr. Varmus, as well as many who are watching him, know how difficult it will be to turn around an organization that has been plagued by problems, including recent complaints by N.I.H. scientists of racial discrimination and sexual harassment.
He will also have to resolve disputes over issues like how much biomedical research should be freewheeling and curiosity-driven, and how much aimed at finding cures for specific diseases or swiftly generating new products and technologies to strengthen the country's economic base. In an era when every Government science program is being squeezed, financing is a major concern.
"One of the things I'm concerned about is that there's been a pretty strong surge of enthusiasm for Harold, who's one of our own, a fundamental investigator," said Dr. J. Michael Bishop, who shared the Nobel Prize with Dr. Varmus in 1989 for their studies of cancer genes. "I hope that doesn't mean people will think he can double the budget and turn things around overnight."
 
Focusing on Immediate Needs
 Rather than seeking great new sources of wealth, or sketching out grand visions of the future of the institutes, Dr. Varmus said he would try to focus on immediate needs and manageable goals. His responsibilities fall into two broad categories.
First, he must consider the institutes' extramural program, the 89 percent of the budget that goes toward supporting biomedical research and education at universities, companies and other organizations throughout the country. Most biomedical research in America, from studying embryonic development in a model animal like a fruit fly, to testing a new immune therapy on human patients, is supported by grants from the N.I.H.
Secondly, Dr. Varmus must oversee intramural work, the research and other programs carried out at the 18 institutes on the Bethesda campus and satellite sites.
As the nation's leading spokesman for biomedicine everywhere, Dr. Varmus's main task, as he sees it, will be to set a tone, to promote the importance of basic research, to emphasize that the spinoffs from basic research have already been profound, and will only get greater.
"His challenge will be to get people excited again about basic science," said Dr. Florence Haseltine, director of the Center for Population Research. "I worry that biomedicine could get so complacent that it risks getting the knees cut out from under it."
As an example, she cited the Superconducting Supercollider, which Congress killed in part because physicists failed to make a strong enough case for its importance.

HEADLINE: Around U.S., Citizens Fight to Take Streets Back

BYLINE: By DON TERRY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 20

 BODY:
Never has the Rev. Michael Pfleger seen so much heartbreak and violence in the inner-city neighborhood around his Roman Catholic church here. But he and his parish are not waiting for the police or the government or the cavalry to come to their rescue.
If they were to wait for help to arrive, Father Pfleger says, the young thugs on the corner might be old men with little thugs of their own. 
 So the parishioners have taken to the streets to discourage drug deals and convince gang members that there is a better way. They have started tutoring programs, found jobs for the jobless and have helped shut down some of the liquor stores that sold alcohol to their children.
They are fed up with the sorrow and the suffering that surrounds them. And they are not alone.
 
Government's Impotence
 All across the country, ordinary citizens faced with extraordinary troubles are patroling their streets, feeding their hungry, treating their addicted. It can be dangerous duty, but night after night they come out of their homes to save their communities in a celebration of people power and a condemnation of the government's impotence.
For too long, they say, they have waited and prayed and paid taxes for their elected officials to make a difference, only to see their neighborhoods crumble from neglect and their children shot down on the way to school.
In recent days and weeks these citizens have been praised and prodded by politicians and preachers to do even more for themselves.
From the pulpit of the church in Memphis, where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last sermon, President Clinton made an emotional appeal last week for people to take responsibility for the social ills around them.
The Rev. Jesse Jackson has been saying the same thing for months to black teen-agers in cities from Washington to Oakland, Calif. Ending the violence in the inner city, he says, is "the new frontier of the civil rights movement."
 
'Please Stop the Killing'
 With bold hearts and empty pockets, grass-roots groups, started around kitchen tables, in church basements or mosques, have been doing for self for years. They have done it because they want to and because they have to. They haunt street-corner drug markets in Washington, patrol mean streets in Atlanta, teach peace in Detroit and distribute food to the homeless in Harlem.
In Greenville, S.C., it is midnight basketball leagues. In Glenwood, Ill., it is dress sales to help send needy children to college or trade school; in San Francisco, rap sessions between the elderly and the youngsters who terrify them at the first hint of dusk.
In Little Rock, Ark., a mock graveyard with 42 white wooden crosses reminds everyone how crucial this crusade of neighbor helping neighbor has become. A sign between the crosses reads: "For goodness' sake, brothers and sisters, please stop the killing."
It is a plea heard around the country.
In Chicago, Father Pfleger said: "The violence and despair is definitely worse than it's ever been. But it's stirred a kind of rebirth of people saying they're not going to take it anymore. People are organizing."
But Father Pfleger said no one should believe that brave citizens can replace in any way trained police officers, social workers and drug counselors.
 
Pressuring Government
 "We need to organize and work as a force to make government and law enforcement do what they are supposed to do," Father Pfleger said. "Instead of one person calling the police when they see a drug deal happening, 22 people should call. The squeaky wheel gets the oil."
Robert Fisher, a professor of social work at the University of Houston, said there were all kinds of grass-roots efforts against violence these days, including Women Against Violence Everywhere, gay groups trying to fight hate crimes, the continued proliferation of neighborhood watch groups.
In middle-class and affluent areas, residents often fight crime with their pocket books, paying for additional security officers and higher fences.
In poorer inner-city neighborhoods, where the sound of gunfire and mourning is loudest, church and small community groups are at the front lines.
"All of this, in many ways, is a positive sign, a typically American response" Professor Fisher said. "Voluntary efforts tend to be more democratic and more responsive to citizens' needs."
 
'Unnoticed and Unrecognized'
 But Professor Fisher said the surge in grass-roots groups had a much darker side.
"Ultimately," he said, "it's a response to the irresponsibility of the public sector and of the society at large refusing to really address the issue of crime and specifically the cause of crime."
This movement of resistance against thugs and terror, poverty and governmental neglect is nothing new in the inner city.
But in recent years, out of necessity and fear, more and more people and groups have banded together to protect themselves from the storm raging through the streets, said Robert L. Woodson, president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise in Washington.
"There are more of these groups springing up now than ever before," he said. "But some of them have been around for 20 years. They go unnoticed and unrecognized."
They do their best, often with budgets stitched together with donations, bake sales and faith.
 
Scholarships for Youths
 The memory of her murdered son keeps Addie Mix going when she is tired after working her full-time job as a public school teacher and when there are still a million and one chores to do before the scholarship dinner.
Mrs. Mix is the co-founder of a two-year-old nonprofit group, Reclaim Our Youth, or R.A.Y., in Glenwood, a southern suburb of Chicago. She began the group with friends after her son was shot to death during his freshman year at a small private college in Texas.
"When something like that happens," Mrs. Mix said, "you either get better or you get worse."
So far this year, R.A.Y. has awarded two $1,000 college scholarships and a $500 stipend for a student entering trade school. In the summer the group runs a camp for children.
There are about 25 members of R.A.Y., most of them teachers. They hold meetings in their homes, where the $5 monthly dues and any donations are collected.
"We are handicapped because of lack of funds, but we just decided we weren't going to let anything get into our way," Mrs. Mix said. "You can always find excuses not to do something."
As these groups try do more than chase bad guys away from their homes and street corners, the word "holistic" keeps coming up.
To Deloyd Parker, the director of the Shape Community Center in Houston, crime and violence are symptoms of larger problems that include unemployment, poverty, crumbling schools and the lack of affordable housing.
"Everyone is going into this thing about violence," he said. "And trust me, violence is symptomatic, and most of what is being addressed are symptoms. When we start focusing more on the causes than the symptoms we'll be in better shape."
But the symptoms are breaking out all over.
 
Taking Youths Off Streets
 A Y.M.C.A. in Buffalo is trying to do something about that with an eight-team basketball league for 120 inner-city youngsters that began last month.
The teams are coached by lawyers, and the games are refereed by judges and police officers. The lawyers are paying all of the league's expenses.
"A lot of these kids, if they weren't in this league, they'd be out there doing something," said the Y.M.C.A.'s director, Larry Stitts.
Before playing the games on Friday nights, the players must attend a workshop where guest speakers talk to them about life and law.
Four years ago in Little Rock, a dozen neighbors, including State Representative William L. Walker Jr., got together to patrol streets where gangs, guns and drugs ruled the night.
But in the last year, the group has been idle, mainly because, Mr. Walker said, it received no assistance from businesses or government to provide jobs, food or housing to the troubled young people on the street.
"Everyone says they're concerned about crime, but whenever these kids try to change, there's nothing available for them to go to," Mr. Walker said. "No jobs, and no one gives them a chance."
He added: "These guys are hungry. They need shelter. They needs jobs, but the community as a whole was not there for them."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: 14TH STREET;
Amid Dispute, Work to Start On Housing for Homeless

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
After three years of sharp local debate, crews will start construction this week on a 12-story apartment house for 94 homeless and low-income families on East 13th Street, along with an adjacent complex of retail shops on 14th Street.
The apartment project, Genesis II, will include medical care, day care, recreation, classes and counseling for its residents. The sponsor is Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, a nonprofit organization founded by Andrew M. Cuomo, the son of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
 Opponents are still fighting the project in court as an illegal use of public money and have appealed to Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani to halt the work when he takes office. But the sponsor, HELP, says the project has final City Council approval and Mr. Giuliani would not be able to change it. His transition office had no comment.
The site is a rubble-strewn lot, vacant for two decades, running from 114 East 14th Street through the block to 113 East 13th Street. The Koch administration tried to develop luxury housing there, and later the site was considered for public housing.
"This space has been a sore spot, a haven for drugs and a public hazard," said Maria Cuomo Cole, who took over HELP after her brother became an Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Clinton Administration. "Now it will revitalize the neighborhood."
Occupancy is planned for early 1995. The city and state will provide $3 million to build the shops and $14 million for the apartments. No leases have been signed yet. Shop rents will go to the city; apartment rents, from $400 to $750 for one to three bedrooms, will pay operating expenses.
The sale of $14 million in tax credits will finance the social-service programs, including advice for parents, job training and computer classes. There will also be a roof garden above the two-story shops and a playground between the buildings.
Half the apartments will be for families from temporary shelters; the rest will be for low-income residents (a family of four can earn up to $27,000 a year). People from the neighborhood will receive preference.
City Councilman Antonio Pagan said that Mr. Cuomo "has bullied this project through against the will of the community." Another opponent, Joanna D. Underwood, president of the East 13th Street Community Association, said the money would provide more housing instantly if used to buy or rent existing apartments. She also argued that "putting a whole group of families with instabilities into one high-rise building" harms them and burdens the neighborhood.
Her association filed two suits, one now awaiting its first ruling and the other on appeal after being rejected. They contend that the sponsors used a condemnation procedure to avoid the city's land-use review process and an auction of the property for the top bid.
Proponents call the project an innovative way to aid the neighborhood and the needy, with services to foster self-sufficiency. They say it conforms to zoning, was the subject of 16 hearings and is legal. BRUCE LAMBERT

HEADLINE: MAKING IT WORK;
The Recruiting Trenches

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
AT 0950 hours on a recent weekday, Staff Sgt. Allen X. Johnson is deep into his square wooden box filled with information cards on prospective recruits. Across the desk in the Army's recruiting station on East Fordham Road in the Bronx, the station commander, Sgt. 1st Class Richard Day, runs down a checklist and peppers Sergeant Johnson with questions.
"Garcia?" 
 "He failed the test; needs to study on his math ability."
"That bad?"
 "Terrible."
All right, forget Garcia. On to a slippery prospect named Evans. "That's a wrong phone number," Sergeant Day says. "I tried it myself."
Sergeant Johnson agrees. "I did a house call on him," he says, smiling. "The address is bogus, too. They do that sometimes."
Together the sergeants work their way down the names, throwing out the prospects who have scored below the 31st percentile on the Army's battery of aptitude tests or who turn out to have medical problems or criminal records. They make notes to call those who have shown interest but need extra persuasion or who have actually signed contracts but are having cold feet.
At 1030 hours, Sergeant Johnson is squared away and ready to head out for a day of meeting, greeting, persuading and advising anyone between 17 and 35 who shows the slightest inclination to listen. The sergeants call this prospecting, and it takes them to schools, shopping centers, unemployment offices, post offices and restaurants -- anywhere that people gather.
The Army may be downsizing, but it still needs recruits. And to get the recruits, it needs recruiters, more than 200 of them working the New York City area alone. Sergeant Johnson is one of them.
The job is repetitive and grueling. Sergeant Johnson wears the Army uniform, but his assignment puts him in that grand door-to-door fellowship that embraces insurance salesmen, Jehovah's Witnesses and peddlers of encyclopedias, people who wake up each morning and know they will encounter a full day of suspicion and rejection.
"You have to go through about 100 people before you get five people to qualify," Sergeant Johnson says, unperturbed. "Sure, there are days when you get up and you'll be dragging a little bit, but then you get out there in the community and see the smiles, and everything's O.K."
Well, mostly O.K. True, recruiting was up for the year ending Sept. 30. The New York battalion signed 608 more recruits than the previous year, when 4,252 enlisted. On the other hand, recruiters have been under siege. On Wednesday a state court handed down a decision that may bar them from state colleges and universities. Responding to a suit filed by a lesbian student at the State University at Buffalo, the court ruled that the military's policy toward gay men and lesbians, who can serve only if they keep their sexual orientation secret, violates an executive order prohibiting discrimination by state agencies on such a basis. A SUNY spokesman said they have not decided whether to appeal the decision.
If the ruling stands, recruiters like Sergeant Johnson will have to come up with some new, creative approaches. No one said the Army would be easy.
Sergeant Johnson, 29, is a wiry Washingtonian with nine years in the service. He is now 22 months into a three-year tour of duty as a recruiter, after which he will return to his usual job of personnel administration. He is assigned to Metro Company, one of five units that make up the batallion responsible for the New York City area. The Fordham Road recruiting station, one of the largest in the city, covers 17.5 square miles of the east-central and northeastern Bronx. With six Army recruiters and one Army Reserve recruiter, Fordham was given the mission, in the last fiscal year, of providing 81 recruits and 52 reservists. It supplied 107 and 49.
Sergeant Johnson's speaking style, deliberate and calm, reflects countless hours of delivering the same message to thousands of young men and women who he firmly believes have everything to gain from a hitch in the Army. "Even if you don't join," he says, "you can still get something from the Army's message: 'Be all you can be.' That applies no matter what you do in life."
Ready to roll, Sergeant Johnson teams up with Staff Sgt. Keilow K. King. The two men stuff a green plastic Army bag with brochures about benefits and programs. In an oversize briefcase they carry cardboard advertising displays.
The team is pumped up. A passer-by eating a slice of pizza asks directions. Sergeant King obliges, then tries to persuade the man to drop in at the recruiting station.
The first visit is to DeWitt Clinton High School, a regular stop on the recruiting route.
The recuiting station keeps in close touch with high schools. It even sends over the 26th Army Band for concerts, then works the crowd with recruiters, who also make a point of attending football and basketball games.
"Basically, this is a community job," said Sergeant Johnson. "We have to learn about the community and be in the community."
In the high school cafeteria, students wander over to a table that Sergeant Johnson and Sergeant King have turned into a neatly organized recruiting table. Both men move quickly from small talk to the pertinent questions: How old are you? Are you doing well in school? What kind of career do you have in mind? Do you want to go to college?
The two recuiters explain that the Army can help, with college loans of up to $30,000 for some four-year enlistees, a powerful inducement. It can provide training in 250 job categories. No need to act now. Under the Delayed Enlistment Program, students can sign on the dotted line but enter the service a year later. "We don't want people to leave school," Sergeant Johnson said.
The students make a rush toward the free plastic Army bags and bumper stickers. Several talk briefly with the recruiters and accept a business card or fill out a form to receive information. A few say they will drop by the recruiting station. Others drift off. Sergeant Johnson ends one conversation by looking into the eyes of a student and saying, "Be all you can be."
After about an hour the two men gather their materials and head off to the school library to replenish the green Army box, which sits about 10 feet from the blue Navy box, with fresh brochures.
Then onward to Bronx Community College, where the students approach more warily. Some express political objections to the military or recount the unpleasant experiences of a friend. Others are clearly interested, however, in seeing exactly what the Army can do for their education.
After about 90 minutes at the college, it's time to head back to the station to do paperwork until 5 P.M. Then "red time" kicks in: one hour of phone calling from lists of high school seniors with the goal of enticing two prospects into the station.
Today has been pretty good, Sergeant Johnson says. Some decent prospects, at least a dozen cards filled out, and plenty of face-to-face contact, which always generates the highest percentage of prospects. Sergeant Johnson has put the word out. It's short and simple: Be all you can be.

HEADLINE: THE PACIFIC SUMMIT;
Leaders at Summit Seek Strong Pacific Community

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 20

 BODY:
President Clinton played host to a Pacific Rim club meeting today, gathering 13 Asian-Pacific leaders in an Indian long house on a windswept island to preach the gospel of open markets and to secure America's foothold in the world's fastest growing economic community.
Mr. Clinton said the free-flowing talks with his counterparts -- the largest such gathering ever of Asian leaders -- had laid the basis for an Asian-Pacific "community" that would play an "increasingly vital role for our nation and the world" by working together to expand trade, lower tariffs and create new high-tech jobs. 
 "At least now, for the first time," Mr. Clinton told reporters during a break in the six hours of talks, "our region has the means to hold serious policy discussions on such questions as how to remove trade barriers and how to sustain robust growth.
"If you ask me to summarize in a sentence what we have agreed, it is this: We have agreed that the Asia-Pacific region should be a united one, not divided. We have agreed that our economic policies should be open, not closed."
 
Open Economic Policies
 "We have also agreed that we should begin to express that conviction by doing everything we possibly can," Mr. Clinton said, to get a good global trade agreement by Dec. 15 that would reduce tariffs and set rules for international commerce.
Dressed in a brown leather bomber-style jacket, lumberjack shirt, brown slacks and boots, Mr. Clinton greeted his guests at the Seattle docks at dawn to carry them by Coast Guard ferry to Blake Island -- like a weekend outdoorsman taking a few fraternity brothers out for a picnic. Only China's President, Jiang Zemin, didn't quite get into the swing of today's L. L. Bean diplomatic dress code, coming in a business suit.
Japan's Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, who is considered something of a fashion plate in Tokyo, showed up in an aviator's scarf, and Kim Young Sam, South Korea's President, wore a Korean cardigan sweater. President Fidel V. Ramos of the Philippines wore black leather gloves in which he jauntily twirled a cigar.
Their casual dress, though, belied the fact that these were the leaders of some of the world's most populous nations, countries that control half of the world's total output of goods and services.
"I hope we will all exchange telephone numbers and fax machine numbers," President Ramos said.
Once on the remote island in the middle of Puget Sound, eight miles off the coast of Seattle, Mr. Clinton and the leaders retreated to a long house in Tillicum Village, a replica of a Native American settlement, where they entered into an unstructured discussion on the future of their Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
Warmed by a space heater during a raw Seattle morning, they were seated in chairs in a circle, each accompanied only by their translators and a single aide.
One official remarked that if the world has become a global village, its Main Street, where the business is booming, is now somewhere around the South China Sea, at the heart of the collection of Asian-Pacific nations gathered here.
As the Pacific Rim leaders waved hello to the cameras from the balcony of the log building with Mr. Clinton standing in their midst, they almost seemed to be waving hello to the American public, and underscoring the President's argument that American jobs and markets will increasingly be coming from Latin America and the Orient, not from across the Atlantic.
 
Largest Gathering Since 1966>
 It was the biggest gathering of Asian and Pacific leaders since President Lyndon Johnson convened a summit meeting in 1966 in Manila to enlist support for the Vietnam War. But this gathering was a striking contrast to the East-West get-togethers that have so dominated global politics during the cold war. Here the issue was not the balance of power, but the balance of trade. Here the acronyms being tossed around were not Start, NATO or C.F.E., but APEC, Asean and G.N.P. Here the question being asked most by reporters was not who blinked, but who paid?
Indeed, many officials seemed to feel a certain electricity in the air here that comes from witnessing the creation of a grouping of powers that all the participants appear to believe is going to be important -- though no one is quite sure what shape it will take.
The Asian-Pacific nations are deeply wary about being herded together too tightly by the United States, because they fear both its political domination and its insistence on expanding human rights along with expanding trade. Japan's Foreign Minister, Tsutomu Hata, reflected that wariness when he told reporters that APEC should evolve through "incremental gradualism by consensus."
The unusual combination of energy and ambiguity that surrounded this meeting was captured in a "vision statement" issued by the leaders at the close of their session. It was long on vision and short on specifics.
"In this post-cold-war era, we have an opportunity to build a new economic foundation for the Asia-Pacific that harnesses the energy of our diverse economies, strengthens cooperation and promotes prosperity," it said. "Our meeting reflects the emergence of a new voice for the Asia-Pacific in world affairs."
 
'Cooperative Solutions'>
 It said that APEC envisaged a community of Asia-Pacific economies that will work together to promote "cooperative solutions" to global economic problems, an open international trading system, improved education and training and advances in telecommunications and transportation among member states.
Mr. Clinton said the leaders had agreed to gather next year in Indonesia for a second regional summit meeting. The importance of such annual meetings, say American officials, is that it will begin to give more of a structure and permanence to this Asian-American alliance.
During today's discussions President Kim of South Korea quoted a Korean proverb: "The beginning is half the job done."
A White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, said the next meeting will take place in November or December 1994 following Congressional elections in the United States.
 What Mr. Clinton hoped to achieve most from this summit meeting -- and appears to have accomplished is to insure that America is not slowly locked out of this emerging Asian economic Main Street, which is growing twice as fast as Europe.
The Asians, for their part seem anxious to make sure that they also have a strong link with the emerging North American free trade zone. American officials also hoped that the prospect of an American-Asian trading association would force the Europeans to make the last concessions needed to complete the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -- the worldwide trade agreement -- by Dec. 15. "The message to Europe" from this meeting, Mr. Clinton said, "is we want this to be a united but open community and we want Europe to work with us to get a good GATT agreement. We want them to join us in a new world trading system."
On Thursday, APEC added Mexico and Papua New Guinea to its roster and agreed to add Chile next year. In addition to those newcomers, current members are: Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Phillipines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.
While American officials expressed satisfaction with the results of this week's summit, it did underscore the tension between Washington's three priorities in Asia -- expanding trade, promoting human rights and democratization and stemming missile proliferation.
None of the Asian-Pacific leaders share America's enthusiasm for making trade benefits contingent on human rights performance. And the more the United States pushes to expand trade in the region to create jobs back home, the more leverage the Chinese and others have in resisting American demands on human rights.
American officials said that despite the good public face that Mr. Clinton tried to put on his meeting Friday with the Chinese president -- saying that they had at least begun a dialogue about human rights and other issues -- the Chinese leader in fact gave Mr. Clinton nothing whatsoever.
With the Chinese now running a $19 billion dollar trade surplus with Washington, and doing business in almost all 50 states, they seem increasingly confident that Congress will not strip them of their trade benefits because it would cost too many jobs in too many parts of America -- particularly Seattle, whose Boeing Aircraft company now does 14 percent of its business with China.
 
China Sees U.S. as Codependent
 China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, bluntly told reporters that this issue of whether or not the United States will renew China's low trading tariffs in June -- depending on its human rights behavior -- is a relic of the past, because Washington is now as dependent on the trade for creating middle-class jobs as China is.
"It is not the case of a special advantage to one side or a special disadvantage to the other," Mr. Qichen said, when asked if he feared that Washington would not renew China's most-favored-nation trade beneifts. "We do not approve of the practice of linking things which have nothing to do with trade issues."
Mike Jendrezejczyk, head of Asia Watch, a human-rights monitoring organization, said he was struck by "the amazing confidence the Chinese now have that trade will take care all their problems in America."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page picture caption in some editions yesterday about the meeting of Pacific Rim leaders misidentified the man in the right foreground. He was Prime Minister James Bolger of New Zealand, not Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada.
The main front-page article on Nov. 21 about the meeting of Asian-Pacific leaders in Seattle misstated the surname of the Foreign Minister of China at one point. He is Qian Qichen; Qian is the surname.

HEADLINE: SENATE APPROVES BRADY LEGISLATION AND TRADE ACCORD

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 20

 BODY:
The Senate passed the Brady gun control bill and the North American Free Trade Agreement tonight and finished its major work for the year.
That left the House still struggling to conclude the first session of the 103d Congress as it faced tough fights Sunday and Monday over campaign finance and lobbying legislation and a measure to impose $90 billion in further budget cuts. 
 But with tonight's action this session established itself as one that produced more legislation than any in the last several years. Besides the trade agreement, the likely enactment of the gun bill and the $496 billion deficit reduction measure voted last summer, Congress also passed significant legislation on family leave, national service, student loans and easier voter registration.
 
Compromise Opens Way
 The 63-to-36 vote to impose a five-day waiting period on the purchase of handguns came after a day of negotiations in which Republicans dropped the filibuster they had successfully maintained Friday night in exchange for an amendment that amounted to a political fig leaf.
To pass the bill, which supporters had conceded was all but dead, proponents agreed that the waiting period would be in force for four years, unless the Attorney General decided a fifth year was necessary. Earlier they had insisted on five years. But Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told the Senate he would go back to five years in conference with the House, which passed a version of it two weeks ago.
Final enactment later this month is likely, although Mr. Biden's admission that he would not fight for the amendment infuriated some Republicans, and they could delay action until next year. Under the bill, a handgun purchase would be delayed for five working days, unless a state imposed a longer waiting period.
The Brady bill, which had been bottled up by opponents for seven years, is named for James S. Brady, the White House press secretary wounded in the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981.
 
Republicans Claim Credit
 The vote on the trade agreement was 61 to 38, with 27 Democrats and 34 Republicans in favor and 28 Democrats and 10 Republicans against it.
It was sent to President Clinton after Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine told the Senate that the measure was a significant token that "this nation will actively engage the challenges of this post-cold war world."
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, claimed credit for his party for the decision, because, while the outcome was not in doubt in the Senate, in the House Republicans provided the critical votes while most Democrats opposed the bill. "By remaining true to our historic commitment to the philosophy of free trade, open markets and job creation, we made the difference, and we did what was right for America," he said.
Eager to wrap up the session, senators hung around the chamber for hours on end instead of going back to their offices, though proceedings were occasionally interrupted by shouts from the cloakrooms, where many senators exulted at the exciting finish of the football game between Boston College and Notre Dame.
 
Health Care Bill Introduced
 The major event in the House today was not legislative action but the long-delayed introduction of President Clinton's health care bill. It appeared that the measure differed only in minor detail from the bill presented to Congress, but not formally introduced, in late October.
House leaders struggled to get the 100 co-sponsors that the Administration's leader on health care, Hillary Rodham Clinton, had insisted they produce. But they did it with 95 regular members of the House, and the delegates from American Samoa, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
There were no speeches on the introduction. But Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, issued a statement maintaining that the bill would be passed next year and would "do away -- forever -- with the anxiety that too many Americans feel today about their health insurance: that it will cost more than they can afford; that they can't get coverage or will lose it; that it won't cover what they need."
The measure was also expected to be introduced in the Senate before all senators leave the capital. They will return in late January for the second session of this Congress.
 
Breaking a Roadblock
 Before the Senate could get to the trade measure, it had to clear a major obstacle, Senator Phil Gramm's effort to tie up a bill providing $1.1 billion in emergency unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless.
The Senator had sought to force Congress to include in the bill a cut of 252,000 Federal employees. The cut was proposed in the Administration's "reinventing government" plan.
But the Senate defeated Mr. Gramm's proposal, 63 to 36, then passed the conference measure by 79 to 20 before sending it back to the House, where approval seems certain.
Although the Senate had added the jobs provision and the House had taken nonbinding votes to include it, opposition by Government employee unions and Democratic leaders kept it from being part of the final compromise.
 
Many Small Bills
 By 54 to 45, the Senate also voted to allow the Resolution Trust Corporation to spend $18.3 billion to bail out failed thrifts. As a condition for the release of more than $10 billion, the measure requires the Treasury Secretary to certify that the agency has complied with a number of management reforms, including a tightening of contracting oversight. The measure still awaits action in the House.
Besides the introduction of the health care bill, the House indulged in a flurry of noncontroversial legislating, with several bills, like the Fountain Darter Preservation Act and the Chinook Salmon Broodstock program, being passed in as little as a minute. And a long debate began, though no vote was taken, over a bill to make the District of Columbia the nation's 51st state, the state of New Columbia. That measure seems to have no chance of passage.
Off the floor the biggest activity was in a Democratic caucus of two and a half hours to assemble votes for the bills to change the campaign finance and lobbying disclosure laws.
The campaign measure would create voluntary spending limits of up to $800,000 in House races, with vouchers for up to $200,000 worth of communications spending -- mail and broadcast -- to be given to candidates who accept the spending limits.
 
Bill Faces Obstacle
 The measure, which is similar to one passed last year in the certainty that President George Bush would veto it, as he did, is scheduled to come before the House on Sunday.
But Representative Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat who has supported public financing in the past, has contended that he has the votes to block consideration of the bill. He maintains that it would be better to pass a much simpler bill, one that reduces contribution limits by political action committees to $1,000 from $5,000 and by individuals to $500 from $1,000.
Mr. Synar said today that he had 60 to 70 Democratic backers to prevent the leadership bill from coming up, which would be enough if he got the solid Republican support that was promised on the procedural vote over taking the bill up. But he said the leaders might yet turn the issue around.
Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts said there was overwhelming support for the leadership plan. "Women and blacks particularly said the other alternatives put them at a disadvantage," he said, adding that they argued that they depend on "cooperative fund-raising" while their opponents depend on wealthy individual contributors. The Synar bill would ban the "bundling" of individual contributions by organizations like Emily's List, which backs Democratic women who support abortion rights.
The discussion on lobbying reform took the form of a long question-and-answer session between caucus members and Representative John Bryant of Texas, whose subcommittee is working on the issue. "There were a lot of concerns expressed about how the lobby reform would work," said Representative Martin Frost. "Members had trouble following the bill."
Representative Bryant passed out a simple table to explain what would be allowed or banned. All travel paid for by lobbyists, for example, would still be allowed but would have to be disclosed in considerably more detail than it is now. Meals could not be paid for by lobbyists, but could be provided by another company representative, even if the lobbyist was present.

HEADLINE: Now It's Japan's Turn to Play Catch-Up

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
LAST month, Takenori Kanzaki, head of Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, summoned top executives from about 100 communications companies to an early morning meeting and showed them a videotape prepared by his agency.
The tape opened with President Clinton and Vice President Gore in Silicon Valley, talking about plans for the so-called information superhighway. It then showed American scientists working on an interactive television project. There were glimpses as well of the installation of optical fibers to increase capacity of an American cable TV system and of an American service that delivers personalized electronic newspapers to computer users. "America is again aiming to gain world leadership with the superhighway plan," the narrator intoned. 
 A few years ago, such a scare tactic might have been used in the United States to warn of Japan's impending conquest of some new market. But when it comes to advanced telecommunications, it is Japan that is now waking up to the fact that it is far behind the United States, at a great risk to its economy. And Mr. Kanzaki's ministry, far from being the solution, is blamed by many experts for being part of the problem, having overregulated Japan's telecommunications industry and smothered innovation.
In the United States, for instance, the use of electronic mail and computer networks is exploding, providing a new forum for commerce, speeding corporate decision-making and allowing scientists to swap data.
But in many Japanese offices, papers are still piled high and the number of personal computers per 100 workers (just 9.9) is only one-fourth that of the United States. Of the PC's that are there, only 13.4 percent can communicate with other computers within a company, through so-called local area networks, compared with 55.7 percent in the United States. And California alone has six times as many computers connected to the Internet, the worldwide network that is growing like a weed, as all of Japan.
"We are almost 10 years behind the United States" in networking, said Tateo Arimoto, an official of the Science and Technology Agency.
 
Other Big Gaps
 In the United States, cable television is evolving into a conduit for hundreds of channels, video on demand and two-way educational programming, among other things.
But in Japan, fewer than 3 percent of households receive cable programming compared with 60 percent in the United States. And while American cable companies like Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner Inc. are strong and busy forging alliances, Japan's cable companies remain small and for the most part are too unsophisticated even to provide pay-per-view services.
And in the United States, wireless communications are beginning to stretch the boundaries of the office, allowing people to stay in touch from anywhere, anytime. But in Japan the relative number of users of cellular phones is less than one-third of that in the United States. And there is little of the entrepreneurial activity found in the United States aimed at wireless transmission of data.
Developing its own information infrastructure is vital to Japan for several reasons. For one, new services like interactive television or huge computerized data bases can be big businesses in and of themselves.
Moreover, advanced communications can improve the productivity of existing businesses or assist in scientific research. Gobs of data from satellites studying the earth remain unusable by many scientists in Japan for lack of a high-speed network to deliver the information, said Hiroshi Mizuta of the National Space Development Agency.
Japan's lack of sophisticated networks could also threaten its world-leading electronics companies. With their home market underdeveloped, such companies will have to design their most advanced portable phones, video equipment and telephone switches for use abroad, which is a little more difficult.
For the same reason, Japanese companies missed the market for machines known as routers, electronic "traffic cops" used to connect smaller computer networks into bigger ones. A future product they might trail in -- unless they work with American companies -- is the cable converter that could well control the flow of information into the home.
 
The Missing Link
 Indeed, electronic distribution of video, games, music and computer data could be a competitive threat to Japanese hardware, such as video- game machines, CD-ROM players and videocassette recorders. Japanese companies like Sony and Matsushita, which have already expanded beyond hardware to software, or programming, through purchases of Hollywood movie studios, now must ponder whether they are still missing a link -- distribution.
Both Sony and Matsushita have talked recently with John Malone, head of T.C.I. He is said to be interested in purchasing a stake in one of their movie studios, which would give one of them a tie-up in the cable business. A Sony executive said the company is interested in cable. But Tsuzo Murase, executive vice president of Matsushita, said his company is not interested in buying into cable nor in selling its studio, MCA Inc.
One reason Japan is lagging, particularly in computer communications, is cultural. Typing Japanese is difficult, making personal computers less convenient than sending handwritten messages on fax machines.
The Japanese also value face-to-face communications. Ikuo Nishioka, who became the head of the Intel Corporation's Japanese subsidiary a year or so ago after a career at the Sharp Corporation, said he was "astonished" at Intel's use of electronic mail. When he completed his orientation visit to Intel's headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., he said goodbye to other executives instantly by sending them messages. "In Japan," he said, "it would take two weeks to say goodbye," by arranging appointments.
At the International Superconductivity Technology Center, a Government-backed research lab here, the cultural problem is of another sort. The laboratory's director forbids the use of electronic mail, afraid that confidential information will leak out.
Other problems include the fact that it costs 5 to 10 times as much to lease a data line here as it does in the United States, said Izumi Aizu of the Tokyo-based Center for Global Communications. And Tokyo has been reluctant to support the Internet because it does not use a communications standard the Government has been backing.
 
Biggest Problem
 That is indicative of the biggest problem, many experts say: The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has ruled over the industry with a heavy hand and has been slow to authorize new services. Such tight regulation might have helped protect Japan's market from foreign competition, but it has also stifled the innovation spurred by the more open market in the United States.
A few years ago, for instance, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company tried to introduce a service here that would allow consumers to use a computer modem while talking on the phone. But regulation was so strict the company gave up.
"What's lagging is not the technology," said Roger Moore, president of the Japanese operations of Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd. "What's lagging has been more the changes in the competitive environment."
Japanese companies, after all, are among the leading manufacturers of cellular telephones. The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Japan's main phone company, and competitors like the DDI Corporation are making good progress on newer digital cellular service and the next generation of mobile phone service.
But because of Government regulation, rates for cellular phone service in Japan are among the highest in the world and customers must rent their phones from the service supplier, paying about $600 a year for a phone that could be purchased for half that amount in the United States.
Cable television has suffered because the telecommunications ministry decided to back a still commercially unsuccessful effort to transmit television programs from satellites to homes. Cable was relegated to being a local service aimed mainly at improving television reception. It was not until 1989 that satellites were used to distribute programs to cable systems, allowing for the development of nationwide cable programming services similar to MTV and Cable News Network. And a controlling interest in a cable company can be held only by an investor based in that company's service area, a rule that will soon change but has left cable operators small and Balkanized.
"We don't have capital" in the industry, said Yasushige Nishimura, who is in charge of the cable business at the Sumitomo Corporation. "We don't have personnel resources. We don't have expertise."
 
Government's View
 Responding to criticism, Masaharu Matsumoto, deputy director of the cablecast division of the telecommunications ministry, said cable TV in Japan is less regulated than in the United States. Cable operators here, he said, do not pay franchise fees and do not have ceilings on their rates.
To be sure, in terms of technology and deregulation of its telephone system, Japan is hardly in last place and is ahead of some European countries such as France and Germany. And much of the frenzy of industry activity in the United States, including the recent rash of alliances, might not result in profitable businesses.
Japan also has a capacity to advance rapidly once it decides what it must do. And that dawning is now occurring. Earlier this month the Social and Economic Congress of Japan, a group that has the ear of the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry, submitted an "emergency" proposal to the Government saying Japan is "decisively behind" in telecommunications and needs a program to catch up.
Already cable TV, computer network and cellular phone use has accelerated. And deregulation is gradually occurring, pushed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The rule requiring cellular subscribers to lease their phones will be gone by April, for instance.
Expertise is also being imported, giving American and European companies a chance to break into the Japanese market. Last week, the Nynex Corporation said it planned to build advanced cable systems in partnership with the Tomen Corporation, a trading company. T.C.I. has taken a stake in a cable programming service controlled by Sumitomo. And N.T.T., to tap into American technology, made an investment this month in Nextel Communications, a mobile radio company.
The telecommunications ministry's showing of the Clinton-Gore video last month was meant to garner industry support for a pilot project in which optical fiber will be installed in 300 homes near Kyoto to test delivery of video on demand, video telephones and other services.
But there is a debate here, as in the United States, about whether development of the information superhighway should be the role of Government or of industry. Within the Government, there is also a bitter war for control between the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the trade ministry.
N.T.T., which was privatized in 1985, says it can wire the entire country with optical fiber by itself by the year 2015. It is experimenting with new services like super high-definition television, which is twice as sharp as existing HDTV and would allow medical images to be transmitted with enough clarity for diagnosis by doctors in other locations.
N.T.T. estimates that providing optical fiber to every home and business will cost $400 billion, an amount it says it can manage. But others have their doubts and there are reports the start of the fiber plan is being postponed. N.T.T.'s profits have been decimated by competition in the long-distance business and by regulations that have held down local rates.
There are also doubts about whether such a high-capacity network can pay for itself. The telecommunications ministry must decide whether to allow N.T.T. to be in the video programming business. If it does not allow it, N.T.T. might never be able to make the optical fibers pay off. But if it does, N.T.T. might crush some fledgling cable television companies.
In electronic mail, Japan's problems are not only Government regulation, but also lack of the Government's usual participation in industrial development. In a reversal of roles, Washington underwrote the development of research networks in the United States while some frustrated scientists in Japan have had to hook up their own networks.
"Our Government doesn't understand the importance of internetworking yet," said Haruhisa Ishida, a professor in the computer center at the University of Tokyo.
To the extent Government agencies do have networks, they do not communicate with other agencies. A message from one to another might have to go through the United States.
 
Plugging In
 The Government is now planning to remedy that with an interagency network to connect 100 national research institutes, with eventual extensions to universities. But some scientists from industry and Government think that plan, which could cost about $40 million in the first three years, does not go far enough. They are suggesting a far more ambitious plan to allow researchers to use supercomputers through an extremely high-speed network. But this project, which could cost at least $300 million, has not yet received approval.
In business, use of networking is also starting to spread. Tadashi Sekizawa, president of Fujitsu Ltd., travels with a pocket computer to check his electronic mail. Japanese affiliates of A.T.&T. and the Intercon Systems Corporation of Herndon, Va., have just begun offering companies here access to the Internet.
And Japanese counterparts of Compuserve and Prodigy, the personal computer services, are also gaining popularity. The two main services, NEC's PC-VAN and Fujitsu's Nifty-Serve, did not start until 1987. Now each has more than 500,000 subscribers.
"When we started this business," said Takashi Yamakawa, general manager of the planning department at Nifty-Serve, "we were afraid that Japanese were too shy to express their private opinions in public spaces like forums."
Now, the on-line forums are overloaded with messages, a sign that a networking culture might not be all that foreign to Japan after all.
 
 
 
JAPAN'S MAVERICK MASTER OF THE INTERNET
 JUN MURAI is the father of the Internet in Japan, a role that has brought him a measure of fame but not always made him popular with the establishment.
Dr. Murai, who teaches at Keio University, began trying to connect Japan's computers to the world in 1984. As a first step, he had to develop Japanese language ability for the software used to control the Internet, the worldwide network.
A ball of energy, Dr. Murai started JU-Net and WIDE, nonprofit networks that connect universities and tie them into the Internet. He is also on Internet's architecture board.
All this has made the 38-year-old computer scientist a revered guru. A company called Intercon International recently advertised that he would be the speaker at a news conference in which it would introduce a service to connect Japanese businesses to the Internet. But Dr. Murai, who is known for having an overloaded appointment calendar, couldn't make it. "Some Japanese press didn't walk in the door when they saw Murai was not there," said Intercon's president, Roger Boisvert.
Some scientists, however, feel Dr. Murai is too powerful and he has had his share of clashes with the Government. He has been an adviser to Internet Initiative Japan, a startup that is trying to provide Internet connectivity to businesses but has so far failed to get a Government permit.
The WIDE network was developed with academic volunteers and corporate contributions, without waiting for the Government. Such a grass-roots effort has not always been appreciated by the Education Ministry, which is developing its own networks.
Dr. Murai said he has little patience with regulators. "Government people like to control things and I don't like to be controlled," he said.
Someday, Dr. Murai said, he would like to be a visiting scholar in the United States. "It's very interesting to see how people are using computers for their daily lives there, which is not happening in this country," he said.
Not surprisingly, computers play a big part in his daily life. His house is wired with a local area network so he can sit in his kitchen and connect to his computer room and by high-speed data lines to the world beyond. "My 8-year-old daughter communicates with me by e-mail," he said proudly.
His ultimate goal: "I want to connect all the computers in this world."
 
 
 
THE SHAKY SATELLITE GAMBIT
 INSTEAD of cable television, Japan has placed its bets on broadcasting directly from satellites to homes. But the satellite business has had trouble getting airborne.
The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications decided on using a type of satellite that had a powerful signal but could carry only a few channels. It reserved two of those channels for NHK, the state-controlled broadcasting company. To provide programming for a third channel, the ministry in 1984 pooled investments of more than 200 companies into Japan Satellite Broadcasting under the leadership of a former ministry bureaucrat.
Today, Japan Satellite has only 1.4 million subscribers for its pay-television service, known as Wowow. That is less than half the 3 million needed to break even. Earlier this year Japan Satellite was rescued from financial straits by a group of banks and the president was replaced.
It wasn't until a few years ago that the ministry liberalized the use of a different type of satellite, previously used in Japan mainly for phone service. These satellites have a less powerful signal but can transmit far more channels. New companies, backed by Japan's giant trading companies, began using them to distribute cable programming. They are also starting to broadcast directly to homes in competition with the older satellites. But the two types of satellites require different receiving equipment, fracturing the market and confusing consumers.

HEADLINE: Now It's Japan's Turn to Play Catch-Up

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
LAST month, Takenori Kanzaki, head of Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, summoned top executives from about 100 communications companies to an early morning meeting and showed them a videotape prepared by his agency.
The tape opened with President Clinton and Vice President Gore in Silicon Valley, talking about plans for the so-called information superhighway. It then showed American scientists working on an interactive television project. There were glimpses as well of the installation of optical fibers to increase capacity of an American cable TV system and of an American service that delivers personalized electronic newspapers to computer users. "America is again aiming to gain world leadership with the superhighway plan," the narrator intoned. 
 A few years ago, such a scare tactic might have been used in the United States to warn of Japan's impending conquest of some new market. But when it comes to advanced telecommunications, it is Japan that is now waking up to the fact that it is far behind the United States, at a great risk to its economy. And Mr. Kanzaki's ministry, far from being the solution, is blamed by many experts for being part of the problem, having overregulated Japan's telecommunications industry and smothered innovation.
In the United States, for instance, the use of electronic mail and computer networks is exploding, providing a new forum for commerce, speeding corporate decision-making and allowing scientists to swap data.
But in many Japanese offices, papers are still piled high and the number of personal computers per 100 workers (just 9.9) is only one-fourth that of the United States. Of the PC's that are there, only 13.4 percent can communicate with other computers within a company, through so-called local area networks, compared with 55.7 percent in the United States. And California alone has six times as many computers connected to the Internet, the worldwide network that is growing like a weed, as all of Japan.
"We are almost 10 years behind the United States" in networking, said Tateo Arimoto, an official of the Science and Technology Agency.
 
Other Big Gaps
 In the United States, cable television is evolving into a conduit for hundreds of channels, video on demand and two-way educational programming, among other things.
But in Japan, fewer than 3 percent of households receive cable programming compared with 60 percent in the United States. And while American cable companies like Tele-Communications Inc. and Time Warner Inc. are strong and busy forging alliances, Japan's cable companies remain small and for the most part are too unsophisticated even to provide pay-per-view services.
And in the United States, wireless communications are beginning to stretch the boundaries of the office, allowing people to stay in touch from anywhere, anytime. But in Japan the relative number of users of cellular phones is less than one-third of that in the United States. And there is little of the entrepreneurial activity found in the United States aimed at wireless transmission of data.
Developing its own information infrastructure is vital to Japan for several reasons. For one, new services like interactive television or huge computerized data bases can be big businesses in and of themselves.
Moreover, advanced communications can improve the productivity of existing businesses or assist in scientific research. Gobs of data from satellites studying the earth remain unusable by many scientists in Japan for lack of a high-speed network to deliver the information, said Hiroshi Mizuta of the National Space Development Agency.
Japan's lack of sophisticated networks could also threaten its world-leading electronics companies. With their home market underdeveloped, such companies will have to design their most advanced portable phones, video equipment and telephone switches for use abroad, which is a little more difficult.
For the same reason, Japanese companies missed the market for machines known as routers, electronic "traffic cops" used to connect smaller computer networks into bigger ones. A future product they might trail in -- unless they work with American companies -- is the cable converter that could well control the flow of information into the home.
 
The Missing Link
 Indeed, electronic distribution of video, games, music and computer data could be a competitive threat to Japanese hardware, such as video- game machines, CD-ROM players and videocassette recorders. Japanese companies like Sony and Matsushita, which have already expanded beyond hardware to software, or programming, through purchases of Hollywood movie studios, now must ponder whether they are still missing a link -- distribution.
Both Sony and Matsushita have talked recently with John Malone, head of T.C.I. He is said to be interested in purchasing a stake in one of their movie studios, which would give one of them a tie-up in the cable business. A Sony executive said the company is interested in cable. But Tsuzo Murase, executive vice president of Matsushita, said his company is not interested in buying into cable nor in selling its studio, MCA Inc.
One reason Japan is lagging, particularly in computer communications, is cultural. Typing Japanese is difficult, making personal computers less convenient than sending handwritten messages on fax machines.
The Japanese also value face-to-face communications. Ikuo Nishioka, who became the head of the Intel Corporation's Japanese subsidiary a year or so ago after a career at the Sharp Corporation, said he was "astonished" at Intel's use of electronic mail. When he completed his orientation visit to Intel's headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., he said goodbye to other executives instantly by sending them messages. "In Japan," he said, "it would take two weeks to say goodbye," by arranging appointments.
At the International Superconductivity Technology Center, a Government-backed research lab here, the cultural problem is of another sort. The laboratory's director forbids the use of electronic mail, afraid that confidential information will leak out.
Other problems include the fact that it costs 5 to 10 times as much to lease a data line here as it does in the United States, said Izumi Aizu of the Tokyo-based Center for Global Communications. And Tokyo has been reluctant to support the Internet because it does not use a communications standard the Government has been backing.
 
Biggest Problem
 That is indicative of the biggest problem, many experts say: The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has ruled over the industry with a heavy hand and has been slow to authorize new services. Such tight regulation might have helped protect Japan's market from foreign competition, but it has also stifled the innovation spurred by the more open market in the United States.
A few years ago, for instance, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company tried to introduce a service here that would allow consumers to use a computer modem while talking on the phone. But regulation was so strict the company gave up.
"What's lagging is not the technology," said Roger Moore, president of the Japanese operations of Canada's Northern Telecom Ltd. "What's lagging has been more the changes in the competitive environment."
Japanese companies, after all, are among the leading manufacturers of cellular telephones. The Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, Japan's main phone company, and competitors like the DDI Corporation are making good progress on newer digital cellular service and the next generation of mobile phone service.
But because of Government regulation, rates for cellular phone service in Japan are among the highest in the world and customers must rent their phones from the service supplier, paying about $600 a year for a phone that could be purchased for half that amount in the United States.
Cable television has suffered because the telecommunications ministry decided to back a still commercially unsuccessful effort to transmit television programs from satellites to homes. Cable was relegated to being a local service aimed mainly at improving television reception. It was not until 1989 that satellites were used to distribute programs to cable systems, allowing for the development of nationwide cable programming services similar to MTV and Cable News Network. And a controlling interest in a cable company can be held only by an investor based in that company's service area, a rule that will soon change but has left cable operators small and Balkanized.
"We don't have capital" in the industry, said Yasushige Nishimura, who is in charge of the cable business at the Sumitomo Corporation. "We don't have personnel resources. We don't have expertise."
 
Government's View
 Responding to criticism, Masaharu Matsumoto, deputy director of the cablecast division of the telecommunications ministry, said cable TV in Japan is less regulated than in the United States. Cable operators here, he said, do not pay franchise fees and do not have ceilings on their rates.
To be sure, in terms of technology and deregulation of its telephone system, Japan is hardly in last place and is ahead of some European countries such as France and Germany. And much of the frenzy of industry activity in the United States, including the recent rash of alliances, might not result in profitable businesses.
Japan also has a capacity to advance rapidly once it decides what it must do. And that dawning is now occurring. Earlier this month the Social and Economic Congress of Japan, a group that has the ear of the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry, submitted an "emergency" proposal to the Government saying Japan is "decisively behind" in telecommunications and needs a program to catch up.
Already cable TV, computer network and cellular phone use has accelerated. And deregulation is gradually occurring, pushed by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. The rule requiring cellular subscribers to lease their phones will be gone by April, for instance.
Expertise is also being imported, giving American and European companies a chance to break into the Japanese market. Last week, the Nynex Corporation said it planned to build advanced cable systems in partnership with the Tomen Corporation, a trading company. T.C.I. has taken a stake in a cable programming service controlled by Sumitomo. And N.T.T., to tap into American technology, made an investment this month in Nextel Communications, a mobile radio company.
The telecommunications ministry's showing of the Clinton-Gore video last month was meant to garner industry support for a pilot project in which optical fiber will be installed in 300 homes near Kyoto to test delivery of video on demand, video telephones and other services.
But there is a debate here, as in the United States, about whether development of the information superhighway should be the role of Government or of industry. Within the Government, there is also a bitter war for control between the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and the trade ministry.
N.T.T., which was privatized in 1985, says it can wire the entire country with optical fiber by itself by the year 2015. It is experimenting with new services like super high-definition television, which is twice as sharp as existing HDTV and would allow medical images to be transmitted with enough clarity for diagnosis by doctors in other locations.
N.T.T. estimates that providing optical fiber to every home and business will cost $400 billion, an amount it says it can manage. But others have their doubts and there are reports the start of the fiber plan is being postponed. N.T.T.'s profits have been decimated by competition in the long-distance business and by regulations that have held down local rates.
There are also doubts about whether such a high-capacity network can pay for itself. The telecommunications ministry must decide whether to allow N.T.T. to be in the video programming business. If it does not allow it, N.T.T. might never be able to make the optical fibers pay off. But if it does, N.T.T. might crush some fledgling cable television companies.
In electronic mail, Japan's problems are not only Government regulation, but also lack of the Government's usual participation in industrial development. In a reversal of roles, Washington underwrote the development of research networks in the United States while some frustrated scientists in Japan have had to hook up their own networks.
"Our Government doesn't understand the importance of internetworking yet," said Haruhisa Ishida, a professor in the computer center at the University of Tokyo.
To the extent Government agencies do have networks, they do not communicate with other agencies. A message from one to another might have to go through the United States.
 
Plugging In
 The Government is now planning to remedy that with an interagency network to connect 100 national research institutes, with eventual extensions to universities. But some scientists from industry and Government think that plan, which could cost about $40 million in the first three years, does not go far enough. They are suggesting a far more ambitious plan to allow researchers to use supercomputers through an extremely high-speed network. But this project, which could cost at least $300 million, has not yet received approval.
In business, use of networking is also starting to spread. Tadashi Sekizawa, president of Fujitsu Ltd., travels with a pocket computer to check his electronic mail. Japanese affiliates of A.T.&T. and the Intercon Systems Corporation of Herndon, Va., have just begun offering companies here access to the Internet.
And Japanese counterparts of Compuserve and Prodigy, the personal computer services, are also gaining popularity. The two main services, NEC's PC-VAN and Fujitsu's Nifty-Serve, did not start until 1987. Now each has more than 500,000 subscribers.
"When we started this business," said Takashi Yamakawa, general manager of the planning department at Nifty-Serve, "we were afraid that Japanese were too shy to express their private opinions in public spaces like forums."
Now, the on-line forums are overloaded with messages, a sign that a networking culture might not be all that foreign to Japan after all.
 
 
 
JAPAN'S MAVERICK MASTER OF THE INTERNET
 JUN MURAI is the father of the Internet in Japan, a role that has brought him a measure of fame but not always made him popular with the establishment.
Dr. Murai, who teaches at Keio University, began trying to connect Japan's computers to the world in 1984. As a first step, he had to develop Japanese language ability for the software used to control the Internet, the worldwide network.
A ball of energy, Dr. Murai started JU-Net and WIDE, nonprofit networks that connect universities and tie them into the Internet. He is also on Internet's architecture board.
All this has made the 38-year-old computer scientist a revered guru. A company called Intercon International recently advertised that he would be the speaker at a news conference in which it would introduce a service to connect Japanese businesses to the Internet. But Dr. Murai, who is known for having an overloaded appointment calendar, couldn't make it. "Some Japanese press didn't walk in the door when they saw Murai was not there," said Intercon's president, Roger Boisvert.
Some scientists, however, feel Dr. Murai is too powerful and he has had his share of clashes with the Government. He has been an adviser to Internet Initiative Japan, a startup that is trying to provide Internet connectivity to businesses but has so far failed to get a Government permit.
The WIDE network was developed with academic volunteers and corporate contributions, without waiting for the Government. Such a grass-roots effort has not always been appreciated by the Education Ministry, which is developing its own networks.
Dr. Murai said he has little patience with regulators. "Government people like to control things and I don't like to be controlled," he said.
Someday, Dr. Murai said, he would like to be a visiting scholar in the United States. "It's very interesting to see how people are using computers for their daily lives there, which is not happening in this country," he said.
Not surprisingly, computers play a big part in his daily life. His house is wired with a local area network so he can sit in his kitchen and connect to his computer room and by high-speed data lines to the world beyond. "My 8-year-old daughter communicates with me by e-mail," he said proudly.
His ultimate goal: "I want to connect all the computers in this world."

HEADLINE: The Dining Game: 10 Inside Moves

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER

 BODY:
ONE of the more competitive sports in New York City is played out not in Shea or Yankee Stadium, but rather at the tables of the city's better restaurants. In a city where restaurants are the main arenas of social and business entertaining, you can't be blamed entirely if you begin to believe that you are where you eat.
Getting reservations, securing the right tables, receiving top-notch service, being treated as someone special -- all this is the helium that inflates our social balloons. Oh, yes, food is important, too -- sometimes. 
 Experienced diners, many on liberal expense accounts, have mastered the sport of making restaurants work for them. But even for the merely recreational diner, navigating the tricky shoals of New York City restaurants isn't all that difficult. It's like everything else in this town: You have to know how to play the game.
In the nine years that I spent as a restaurant critic for The New York Times, dining out 10 or more times a week -- and trying hard not to seem like someone -- I picked up some inside moves. Try them on. At the very least, eating out is more fun when you feel that you have an edge.
 
1. BECOMING A REGULAR
 Restaurants are not democratic institutions. Just as clothing stores and butcher shops have regular customers whom they treat with special care, so, too, does a restaurant have preferred customers. There is really nothing wrong with that. It's just good business. So keep in mind that because you do not get pecked on the cheek by the owner and seated at the best table is not necessarily a reason to feel slighted and complain.
An old maxim in dining circles states that the best restaurants are those in which you are well known. Your goal should be to become an insider at restaurants you like. This can be done by frequenting the place, chatting with the owner or maitre d'hotel, and generally moving into the establishment's family circle.
 
 
 
2. FINDING SOMEWHERE NEW: THE SNIFF-AND-RUN METHOD
 There are 15,000 restaurants in New York City; even the average avid diner's universe doesn't really hold more than a dozen. So how to find somewhere new? Pirouetting down the street looking at restaurant awnings is the worst method. You might as well just open the Yellow Pages, close your eyes, and put your finger on a place.
There is a better way. Every month or so, I join a friend, Tim Zagat of the Zagat Survey, in a driving tour of a New York neighborhood in which we visit 30 to 40 places a night. The purpose is to find new restaurants or to check up on old ones. When we see an establishment we want to investigate, we walk in, ask to see a menu and just stand on the fringe of the dining room and observe. (Even though we may look like a couple of Internal Revenue Service agents, standing there in dark suits and refusing to sit down, the owners are usually cordial.)
It is amazing how much you can deduce about a restaurant by spending just a minute inside. Is the room lively? Is it romantic? Is it suitable for discreet business conversations? Are the patrons eating with gusto and enjoying themselves? Does the menu look appealing and original, or just humdrum?
And -- this may be a surprise, but it is critical -- does the dining room smell good? Some places have an arresting aroma of garlic and olive oil or maybe charred steak. If a dining room smells like cleaning fluid, or worse, we head for the door. These sniff-and-run visits are astoundingly accurate, based on our experiences going back for dinner. Among those we discovered this way and returned to later for dinner are Becco, the family-style Italian restaurant on West 46th Street; Oceana on East 55th Street, Trois Jean on East 79th Street, and Zoe on Prince Street. We discounted countless others.
 
3. GETTING IN: THE 40 PERCENT SOLUTION
 That ultra-hot, hard-to-get-into place of the moment may not be as hard to get into as you think. Booked to the gills though they may be, many establishments find themselves with empty tables on weekends, when some people reserve at a few places and decide where to go at the last minute. If you are willing to take a chance, you can simply show up at a restaurant without a reservation at 8 P.M. or later. Restaurants generally hold a table for about 45 minutes, so by that time you may get the table of someone who had reserved for, say, 7 P.M. but never showed up.
Behind this bit of trickery is a surprising -- and, to many a restaurant owner, anguishing -- fact: On an average Saturday night, the top restaurants like Lutece, Le Bernardin and Le Cirque have "no show" rates of up to 40 percent. "And many of those customers have confirmed that afternoon by phone that they are coming," said Jean-Jacques Rachou, owner of La Cote Basque.
Gilbert Le Coze, owner and chef of Le Bernardin, estimates that on Saturday nights his no-show rate runs from 40 to 60 percent. He does overbook, he said, but not "heavily like the airlines, because what happens if everybody shows up some night?"
Indeed, nothing causes more chaos in a restaurant than people who make reservations and do not have the courtesy to cancel if they can't make it. (Note: If you are going to be more than, say, 15 minutes late, a phone call to the restaurant is greatly appreciated. Chances are they will remember you as a considerate customer and respond in kind.) If you have ever walked into a restaurant and been told it is full, while right in front of you are empty tables, that could be the reason.
 
 
4. TACTICAL TIPPING
 This is the most confusing aspect of eating out to many diners. Yet knowing how to tip -- neither niggardly nor lavishly in a show-off manner -- and whom to tip is another way of currying favor in restaurants.
Since waiters generally earn minimum wage, their income is derived primarily from tips. Therefore, unless you wind up wearing half of your meal or are ignored by the waiters, a standard 15 percent tip on the total pretax bill is expected. Many New Yorkers find it convenient to double the sales tax of 8.25 per cent to arrive at a 16.5 percent tip. If service is exceptionally good, however, a tip of 20 percent or more would be appropriate.
Payment for captains, who usually supervise teams of waiters, varies. In older and traditional establishments, captains often receive substantial salaries and keep all of their tips. In most new restaurants, however, captains earn slightly more than waiters but still depend on tips for much of their income. In these restaurants all tips are pooled. In either case diners should remember that the rule of thumb for restaurants with captains is 16 to 18 percent of the pretax total for waiters plus 5 percent for captains.
If, however, you want to single out a particular captain or waiter for extraordinary work, you can hand him or her cash upon leaving and say something like, "Thank you; this is for you." The amount should be commensurate with the bill, usually $10 to $20.
Maitres d'hotels do not usually receive tips unless they have performed specific favors, perhaps finding you a table on a busy night. In that case a cash gratuity is warranted, usually from $10 to $20.
Sommeliers are increasingly rare. If a restaurant has a sommelier and he or she is genuinely helpful, the rule of thumb is 10 percent of the cost of the wine. If the sommelier does little more than hand you the wine list and pour the first round, no tip is necessary.
Finally, here is a tactic that is rarely employed but can be astoundingly effective in making points with your favorite dining spot. One evening about 12 years ago I was working as a chef's assistant in a French restaurant when the owner came back to us and placed a bottle of Champagne on the counter. "The Smiths" (I don't recall their name) "want to thank you for a great meal."
This dumbfounded me as something about as likely as telling a toll booth attendant, "Keep the change." And you can imagine how we took care of the Smiths on their subsequent visits. The sous-chef was so touched I thought he was going to offer to drive them home.
 
 
5. STRATEGIC COMPLAINING
 Restaurant owners have an adage: A happy customer tells 10 friends; an unhappy one tells 20.
To get satisfaction when something goes wrong in a restaurant, you have to understand how they view the situation; the last thing restaurateurs need is an ugly brouhaha in the dining room. They are more inclined to settle any reasonable complaint on the spot -- that is, if they are approached with civility, not animosity. Bring your complaint to an authority figure, either the manager or the owner. Waiters often have no authority to act above a certain level, so don't waste your time fighting with them.
For instance, a well-run establishment will try to make amends for long delays in seating (say, more than 20 minutes) by buying you drinks or perhaps offering a complimentary course or a bottle of wine.
If you do not get satisfaction on the spot, the best recourse is to write a calm, reasoned letter to the owner. It's a good idea to send carbon copies to local restaurant critics, too. Letters are the most potent arrow in a diner's quiver. Countless times I have seen owners respond to the customer with a phone call or a letter and an invitation to return for dinner on the house. This is good customer relations, and good business.
If the problem involves sanitation in the dining room or the kitchen, that's another matter. Call the New York City Department of Health at (212) 285-9503.
 
 
6. HAVING IT YOUR WAY
 If you have a special request for a restaurant, say a vegetarian meal, you should ask at the time of making a reservation, not when you show up. Doing that at the last minute on a busy night can test the patience of the most genial chef. Occasionally you may crave a simple dish, say a hamburger or pasta with only olive oil and garlic, neither of which are on the menu. In that case, it isn't out of line to ask on the spot if it can be done.
 
7. GETTING A GOOD TABLE
 If you are ushered to an undesirable table -- actually, there should not be really undesirable tables in good restaurants -- politely ask the host if anything else is available. Restaurants are more flexible in seating than they admit. You may have to wait, but if it enhances your experience it is worth it. It is sometimes unreasonable to ask for a specific table, because it may be booked by regulars.
 
8. BEYOND BEAUJOLAIS
 Those who are not comfortable choosing a wine should ask the waiter for a suggestion, always specifying the price range. (The standard markup for wine is twice what you would pay in a wine shop, or three times wholesale.) Most restaurants have at least one person who can make recommendations.
But what if you do not like the wine you choose? The wine may be off, in which case the restaurant must take it back. Or it might be perfectly fine but not to your liking. In that case you should make it known to the waiter. If a restaurant has any class at all, it will replace the wine without comment. There is no law specifying that if you take more than two sips of the wine you must pay for it. It is essentially a matter of courtesy between the restaurant and the customer.
The same applies to food. If you are unhappy with a dish -- even if it is well prepared -- you should talk to the waiter or manager. As in the wine example, a professional restaurateur would never risk alienating a customer for the price of one dish.
 
9. BRINGING YOUR OWN
 From time to time you may find yourself with a special bottle of wine that you would like to drink over a fine meal at a restaurant. The only establishments that allow that as a matter of routine are those that do not serve alcohol. If you bring your wine, they will serve it, sometimes charging a small corkage fee, say $5. Getting other restaurants to allow this is not easy. Some refuse outright because every bottle of wine a customer brings in is a lost wine sale to the restaurant (and with markups of 200 percent or more, that could be a lot of lost revenue).
If you call ahead and ask, however, most will allow it. Corkage fees generally range from $10 to $25.
 
10. GOOD EATING, ON A BUDGET
 A common perception is that New York City is the country's priciest place to dine. Well, it can be, if you ignore the remarkable values that abound in this hard-pressed economy. For example, Gotham Bar and Grill, one of the city's most innovative American restaurants, offers a $19.94 lunch; Jo Jo, the trend-setting bistro on East 64th Street in Manhattan, has a $25 prix fixe lunch, as does its sister restaurant, Vong. Raphael, the handsome French restaurant on West 54th Street, offers a $29 prix fixe dinner, which is a value considering the quality offered, and the Hudson River Club overlooking New York Harbor serves a $24.94 prix fixe dinner that is well worth the price.
This is just a smattering of what is available. Even better bargains can be had by those who are willing to dine at off hours, say, before 7:30 P.M. or after 10 P.M. The special menus come and go, so it is always worthwhile to ask if any exist. You wouldn't take a cross-country airplane flight without checking on discount fares, so why ignore discounts in restaurants?
 
Where Anyone Can Feel Like a King

The best measure of service, of course, is the way a restaurant treats you when you're not a regular. Here, in alphabetical order, is a personal rundown of 10 restaurants that exemplify the best of service.
The preponderance of old-line French establishments is testimony to the long French tradition of fine service. Many of the waiters at these restaurants have been at it for 30 years or more.

CHANTERELLE 2 Harrison Street, at Hudson Street, Manhattan, (212) 966-6960 -- Hushed, formal and elegant, this small downtown French restaurant has an eagle-eyed staff that swoops down when needed and remains at a distant perch when not.
GOTHAM BAR AND GRILL 12 East 12th Street, Manhattan, (212) 620-4020 -- The casually dressed servers at this leading contemporary American restaurant observe all the fine points, and always with good cheer.
HARRY CIPRIANI 781 Fifth Avenue, at 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 753-5566 -- Sharp and professional service has been the hallmark of all restaurants run by the Venetian-born Mr. Cipriani. This one is no exception.
LE CHANTILLY 106 East 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 751-2931 -- The splendid dining room at this French restaurant is run by a pampering crew of mostly French waiters who are omnipresent but never obtrusive.
LE PERIGORD 405 East 52d Street, Manhattan, (212) 755-6244 -- A most congenial French restaurant with formal, black tie service. The seasoned staff could not be more accommodating or eager to please.
MARK'S The Mark Hotel, 25 East 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 879-1864 -- The genteel, English ambiance at this fine hotel restaurant is made even more enjoyable by a knowledgeable, sophisticated service staff.
THE RIVER CAFE 1 Water Street, Brooklyn, (718) 522-5200 -- Service at this glamorous floating restaurant on the East River has been a model for how things are done right. The tradition continues.
THE SIGN OF THE DOVE 1110 Third Avenue, at 65th Street, Manhattan, (212) 861-8080 -- The romantic setting at this innovative French/American restaurant is enhanced by the low-key, highly proficient staff.
THE "21" CLUB 21 West 52d Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-7200 -- The clubby feeling here at this historic New York institution is conveyed by a warm and hard-working staff that makes regulars feel like family. First-time visitors are treated with care as well.
UNION SQUARE CAFE 21 East 16th Street, Manhattan, (212) 243-4020 -- The young, bright, highly trained staff here never loses its composure under relentless pressure. The perpetually smiling waiters and waitresses expose more ivory than a Steinway showroom.

HEADLINE: These Faithful Fans Always Know What Time It Is

BYLINE: By JUDY POKRAS

DATELINE: FLEMINGTON

 BODY:
IMAGINE this: parents in their 40's, with pre-teen-age children in tow, and both age groups singing and clapping to the silly antics of two men, one in his mid-70's, the other just shy of 70.
That was the improbable sight on a recent Saturday as Buffalo Bob and Clarabell performed children's songs from "The Howdy Doody Show" here at a Doodyville Historical Society convention at the Flemington Baptist Church. 
 Buffalo Bob Smith, who turns 76 on Saturday, wearing a fringed, rhinestone-studded frontiersman outfit, played piano and sang "It's Howdy Doody Time" and other favorites. Clarabell (Lew Anderson, 69) in full clown regalia, played clarinet and horsed around, and the duo drew laughs and rapt attention from the audience of about a dozen children and 60 graying adults.
Later, sitting at a table in the church, Buffalo Bob said he started on WNBC radio in March 1947, where he created the voice that eventually became Howdy Doody on television. It was at the suggestion of a producer that he called a Disney artist, Velma Dawson, who created Howdy's freckled face from the sound of Howdy's voice over the phone.
 
Valued Beyond Price
 Buffalo Bob said he keeps the original Howdy Doody marionette in a plastic display case "on a handsome pedestal" in his North Carolina home. When asked what the marionette's value is, he replied, "Well, what would you say your children are worth?"
The Doodyville Historical Society's convention was organized by the society's founder, Jeff Judson, 45, a pharmacist in Raritan Township, with the help of Joseph and Jeanne Cannavo of Swedesboro. Mr. Judson also edits the society's newsletter, The Howdy Doody Times.
The group, consisting mostly of middle-aged fans who are hoping for some kind of revival of "The Howdy Doody Show," began in 1978. It has about 360 members nationwide, Mr. Cannavo said.
The show ran from 1947 to 1960.
Convention attendees -- collectors of marionettes, videotapes and other memorabilia -- came from as far away as California and represented a wide variety of occupations. Fans included two physicians, a psychologist, an accountant, a college professor, a Methodist pastor, a muralist, an exterminator, a police dispatcher, working mothers, secretaries, sales people and others, including a few who were unemployed.
The convention featured a Howdy Doody memorabilia exchange, door prizes, rare film footage, appearances by characters from the show and those who worked behind the scenes, and a Howdy Doody trivia game. (Question: How many freckles did the original Howdy Doody have? Answer: 48, one for each state).
 
Look-Alike Contest
 The costume-contest winner was a redhead, David McLaughlin, 5, of Southampton, who had been transformed into a life-size look-alike of Howdy Doody, in jeans, plaid shirt, bandanna, gloves and cowboy boots.
Conventioneers were treated to drawings of their favorite Howdy Doody characters on the spot by Milt Neil, 79, the show's artist. Mr. Neil, born in Irvington and a Wayne resident since 1937, left Disney to work on "The Howdy Doody Show," where, with the show's writer, Eddie Kean, he designed Flub-a-Dub, Mr. Bluster, Dilly Dally and other puppets.
"Dilly Dally was the only puppet in the world that could wiggle his ears," he said.
Another member of the Howdy Doody team at the convention was Robert (Rip) Rippin, 74, the show's first director and later its producer. Mr. Rippin was born in Perth Amboy and has lived in Colonia since 1950, in "the house that Howdy Doody built," he said.
At the convention dinner, he introduced an old Army buddy, E. Roger Muir, the executive producer of "The Howdy Doody Show," whom the society was honoring.
Mr. Muir, 74, announced that he was talking with executives of NBC, which owns the basic rights to the characters, to produce a series of 90-minute home videos during the next several years and to build a "Doodyville U.S.A." theme park.
Doodyville would feature talking and electronic puppets, displays of the many premiums the show offered in its 13-year network run, and several 50-feet mini-theater "peanut galleries," each with a large-screen television monitor featuring one or two years of the show. From time to time, there would also be appearances of the show's characters.
"I hesitate to say we'll be back on the air, but I'm going to keep trying," Mr. Muir said. "We hope in the next three months we can crack the nut."
 
Network Reviews Options
 Patricia Schultz, an NBC vice president, said in a telephone interview that the network was continually reviewing proposals on how to revive "Howdy Doody" and was also "exploring a lot of different possibilities, like home video."
NBC recognizes that it has a valuable piece of property and a "very popular show and character in Howdy Doody," she said.
Mr. Cannavo said: "The Doodyville Historical Society intends to support Roger in whatever way it can. But the bottom line is, the society wants the show back on the air as soon as possible." He said he thought a theme park would have more merit if the show was actually on the air.
Mr. Cannavo said the society had three ideas for how the show could be brought back: broadcast reruns of the original 2,500 network shows, but with newly shot "intros and outros" featuring Buffalo Bob Smith and Howdy; broadcast reruns of the 135 shows that were shot in 1976 and 1977 for a syndication, or create new holiday specials, using the available members of the original cast and crew.
Mr. Cannavo said the society had collected more than 8,000 signatures in a petition to bring the show back. About 3,000 were collected by a Gloucester County Freeholder, Joseph L. Manganello, a society supporter.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in/Highland Park;
Well-Established, but Unpretentious

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
THE tiny Middlesex County borough of Highland Park has its traffic problems, and its business district could use a facelift. But those who live there find it comfortable and unpretentious, and it is a thriving community.
Its downtown -- Raritan Avenue -- is part of Route 27, one of New Jersey's most congested highways, and traffic there slows to a crawl in the rush hours. The Raritan Avenue business district, which is mainly turn-of-the-century, is within 10 miles of three major shopping centers, Menlo Park in Edison, Woodbridge Center in Woodbridge and the Brunswick Square Mall in East Brunswick. Yet it remains a prosperous business street with few empty stores. 
 Most houses -- and there have been few one-family houses built in the last 30 years -- are on narrow lots and the tax rate is the highest in Middlesex County, mostly because of a lack of industry.
Last year the owners of a Highland Park house assessed at $150,000 would have paid $4,660 in taxes, about 40 percent higher than the tax on a similarly valued home in Sayreville, which has the county's lowest tax rate.
But the houses retained their value through the housing slump and continue to command higher prices than those in most of the surrounding communities.
All Highland Park's school buildings are at least 30 years old and in need of renovation. Yet the students scored an average of 1,016 on their Scholastic Assessment Tests (college boards), the highest average score in Middlesex County.
"It's just as stable as the Rock of Gibraltar," said Thomas F. Boyle, the tax assessor. He added that while most other communities in Middlesex County had dropped in assessed valuation by as much as to 15 percent since 1981 because of the decline in property values, Highland Park had gone up by 9.98 percent.
To begin to understand the dynamics of Highland Park, one must stroll along Raritan Avenue on a warm Saturday morning. The sidewalk is crowded with mothers wheeling baby carriages, Orthodox Jewish men and boys wearing yarmulkes as they walk to services -- there are four synagogues in the borough -- children on bicycles and older people strolling.
Jews account for about 40 percent of the population, with the rest a mix of other white groups, blacks, Hispanics and Asians.
Reflecting the size of the Jewish community, Highland Park is one of the few New Jersey communities encircled by a symbolic fence, known as an eruv in Hebrew. It is a thin wire that is strung along telephone polls surrounding the town. According to Jewish law, Orthodox Jews may carry or wheel things on the Sabbath inside such an enclosure.
Mayor H. James Polos says that one of the secrets to Highland Park's success has always been the accessibility of its political leaders. As an example, he cites an incident in 1920 when Robert Wood Johnson, the founder of Johnson & Johnson, was Mayor.
"An angry resident called the Mayor at home to complain that his garbage was not collected," Mr. Polos said. "That night, Mayor Johnson pulled up in front of the man's house in his limousine and picked up the trash."
WHILE Mayor Polos does not own a limo and has never picked up a resident's trash, he says it is not unusual for him to be approached by residents in the supermarket. "They can talk to their elected officials and get results," he said, "and that makes them feel they have a real stake in the community."
One resident, David S. Levine, said that he was attracted to the borough and its downtown 10 years ago, when he and his wife, Frances, bought a four-bedroom colonial on Dennis Street. They had lived in a rental apartment in Old Bridge, N.J.
"My wife worked in town," he recalled, "and we just observed that it was a quaint, well-established, walking town. So we looked for a house here."
Mr. Levine, marketing director for a computer company in nearby South River, said he enjoyed living in Highland Park because "it is a safe town, where you are comfortable sending your children downtown to buy things."
The Levines have two daughters, 11 and 7 years old. Like many members of the Conservative Jewish community, they send their children to a Jewish private school -- the Solomon Schecter Day School of the Raritan Valley, in nearby East Brunswick. Many Orthodox Jewish residents send their children to the Rabbi Pesach Raymon Yeshiva, in Edison. The Schecter school runs from kindergarten through grade 7 and and the Raymon yeshiva from kindergarten through grade 8.
Milton Ziment, owner of ERA Ziment Realtors on Raritan Avenue, said prices for one-family homes ranged from about $100,000 for some small houses to more than $500,000 for a few new four- to five-bedroom colonials with views of Donaldson Park and the Raritan River.
Many 30- to 40-year-old four-bedroom colonials go for $200,000 to $400,000.
Mr. Ziment, citing figures from the Multiple Listing Service, said the market was improving in Highland Park. In 1991, 44 houses were sold in the borough in an average of 117 days each. So far this year, 51 houses have been sold; they were on the market for an average of 82 days and went for 94 percent of the asking price.
There are just a handful of town-house developments. One of the largest is L'Ambiance, near the border with Piscataway. Its 18 two-bedroom, two-bath units start at about $170,000, Mr. Ziment said.
The luxury condominium apartments market took a beating in the housing slump. In 1989, the eight-story, 83-unit River Ridge Terrace building on South Adelaide Avenue, was completed. The two-bedroom apartments started at $210,000. However, the developer could not sell them all and eventually auctioned off 20 apartments, some for half of the original asking price. Those apartments, which are the high end of the condominium market, now sell for about $120,000.
There are more than 3,000 rental apartments, mostly in the 20 garden-apartment complexes on the perimeter of the borough. Apartments are also available in two-story houses in the center of town. Mr. Ziment said rents ranged from $575 to $660 for one-bedroom and from $675 to $750 for two bedrooms.
Highland Park began as a religious community in 1681, when a group of dissident Baptists led by the Rev. Francis Drake, a descendant of the explorer-adventurer of the same name, arrived from nearby Piscataway and bought land from the Leni Lenape Indians.
In the Revolutionary War, in 1776, Hessian soldiers held a fort on the bluff overlooking the Raritan River and had artillery duels with Alexander Hamilton's battery, which was covering Washington's retreat from New Brunswick.
HIGHLAND PARK went through a growth spurt in 1835 when the New Jersey Railroad built a line from Jersey City to the Raritan River. The passengers had to get off the train and take a stagecoach over a bridge to New Brunswick. The name Highland Park was coined in 1885 by a Mr. Beekman because much of the land was wooded and overlooked the Raritan River
According to William F. Ducca, the borough historian, Highland Park seceded from Raritan Township (now Edison) in 1905 because the residents wanted their own school district. Currently, there are three schools: the k-2 Irving School, on South 11th Avenue; the 3-6 Bartle School, on Mansfield Street, and Highland Park High School, on North Fifth Avenue.
Superintendent of Schools Peter J. Bastardo said the district has received a $4 million low-interest loan from the New Jersey Economic Development Administration to bring the schools up to current codes.
Computers are introduced in kindergarten. By second grade each child is expected to write and publish a story on a desktop computer. Last year, the high school chemistry team won the state championship. Its football team won the state championship for small schools two years ago. Of the 1992 graduating class, 85 percent went on to higher education.
Today, much of Highland Park remains county parkland. It is sandwiched between the 90-acre Donaldson Park off South Second Avenue on the borough's southern tip, and the 473-acre Johnsons Park, on River Road. Both parks have ball fields, picnic grounds, tennis courts and ponds. Johnson Park also has a petting zoo.
Many of Highland Park's residents work in New Brunswick, where there are hospitals, medical laboratories and Johnson & Johnson and Rutgers University. Others are employed in neighboring Edison's Raritan Center industrial park or in Manhattan.
There is an abundance of restaurants on Raritan Avenue, among them a Charlie Brown's, Tabachnik's deli, Hunan East, the Northern Italian Radicchio, the Spanish-Mexican La Fonda and even a rabinically supervised kosher Dunkin' Donuts.
Highland Park has been home to two Nobel laureates. The late Selman A. Waksman was awarded the prize in medicine and physiology in 1952 for his work with antibiotics and Dr. Arno A. Penzias, who shared the 1978 prize in physics for his work related to the big bang theory, still lives there.

In 1963, Charles murdered Barbara in their bedroom with a .32-caliber pistol. He told the court that she was having an affair with a sculptor and had spent more than $200,000 on a black magic center in Massachusetts. At the trial, he was found to be insane and was ordered confined to an institution. The Castle is now used as offices.

HEADLINE: Seeking a G.M. Package That Pleases Everyone

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: NORTH TARRYTOWN

 BODY:
WITH one hand, General Motors last month gave workers at the automotive plant here a brief reprieve, agreeing to keep its assembly lines busy for an extra year before closing for good. With the other, the country's largest auto maker delivered an ultimatum to officials in this Hudson River village: either revoke a precedent-setting local environmental-cleanup law or face legal action.
While workers at one of General Motors' oldest plants were relieved to have a year's grace to plan their futures, village leaders bridled at the get-tough legal stance the auto maker had taken with them. 
 Early this month, the auto maker made good on its ultimatum to the village and filed suit in United States District Court in Manhattan, seeking an injunction against the ordinance enacted last June in North Tarrytown, the Environmental Protection and Abandoned Industrial Property Reclamation Law.
That law, the first of its kind in the state and one of the first in the country, holds General Motors -- or any other large company leaving town -- responsible for cleaning up after itself. It is designed to prevent problems that have occurred in other waterfront communities, like nearby Hastings-on-Hudson, where large companies moved away and left behind environmental hazards, said the law's author, Donald W. Stever, a lawyer who lives in North Tarrytown.
In Hastings-on-Hudson, Anaconda Wire and Cable was situated on the waterfront until 1976. In 1989 a study revealed that it would cost $15 million to clean up polychlorinated biphenyls and heavy metals left in the ground by the company.
The law requires a company that is relocating to remove all hazards, like crude oil, oil derivatives, asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and pesticides. It is also designed to avoid "industrial neighborhood blight," created when companies leave their sites. In addition, the law requires a company to post a bond to cover the cost of building demolition, if necessary, and any other hazardous-waste removal.
 
'An Extreme Breach of Faith'
 Margaret G. Holmes, a General Motors spokeswoman, said that the auto maker was already complying with Federal and state regulations governing industrial sites and added that the company was simply protecting its legal position by filing the suit. She said that the Village Board of Trustees had agreed to rescind the law at a meeting this fall and then reneged and that the law was unduly stringent in comparison with existing state and Federal laws. General Motors was was not abrogating its responsibilities, she said.
But Mayor Sean Treacy saw the company's actions in a different light: "I call it an extreme breach of faith. Clearly, they want to walk away from us after 78 years in this village and show no moral responsibility. This should be a warning to other communities, 'Don't trust G.M.' "
Mayor Treacy and the Village Trustees had courted the auto maker's favor for more than a year in an effort to craft a departure package that would leave both sides satisfied when the company left town.
Ms. Holmes, who said General Motors was still open to negotiation and wanted to settle the lawsuit out of court, said that the suit challenges the village's regulation on several grounds. The law violates Federal interstate commerce regulations and unnecessarily replicatesstate and Federal laws, according to court papers.
 
Precedent for Other Communities
 But local ordinance is also perceived as an attempt to strong-arm the manufacturer, Ms. Holmes said: "It is not an environmental ordinance; it is a pretext for economic protectionism. It is aimed at keeping us in the village or forcing us to find someone else to take over the plant."
Mr. Stever denied the charges, saying that it was "important for the village to take control of its own destiny" to avoid the fate of other riverfront communities.
And Mayor Treacy observed that if the court upheld even parts of the law, it could set a precedent for other communities to follow in the future.
"It is foolish for them to take us into court," he said. "This can only give faith to other communities to enact similar laws to protect themselves."
In February last year, General Motors announced that it would close the 2.5-million-square-foot plant -- one-fourth larger than the World Trade Center -- even though it had been recently retooled for production of the plastic-bodied Chevrolet Lumina, Oldsmobile Silhouette and Pontiac Transport minivans. In part, disappointing sales of the futuristic-styled vehicles contributed to the decision.
 
Sales Have Picked Up
 Before the retooling in the late 1980's, an extensive package of local, county and state concessions -- estimated at $140 million in incentives, tax abatements, special programs and services -- had been offered to the company as an enticement to remain in North Tarrytown. General Motors accepted the package and made plans for a long stay.
But the company's expectations were not in line with the market's response to the minivans, which did not do well in the showroom. In light of this and other financial worries facing the beleaguered auto maker, it tagged the North Tarrytown plant and others for closing. The deadline for North Tarrytown was set for the summer of 1995.
In a concession last month, following four months of contract talks with the United Auto Workers, the manufacturer agreed to extend the deadline and another at a metal- stamping works in Kalamazoo, Mich. Now production of the minivans is scheduled to continue for another 12 months here, while General Motors' plant in Doraville, Ga., gears up for production of a new generation of the vehicles, which have been redesigned and are now selling well, Ms. Holmes said.
Meanwhile, the local economy has already begun to feel the impact of General Motors' planned departure. The first blow came when the workforce here, which stood at 3,450 in February last year, fell to 2,150 six months later when General Motors eliminated its second shift.
 
Village and Schools Will Lose Funds
 Merchants along Beekman Place -- where delicatessens, bars and other establishments line the street that leads down to the plant -- say business is off and that they are worried about their survival once the plant closes in two and a half years. The closing date, with the extension, is now the summer of 1996.
"We lost our afternoon trade when the plant went to a single shift, and once they leave altogether, it is going to make a big dent in our lunch trade," said Christopher Rezza, co-owner of Green County Importing Corporation, a grocery store and delicatessen. "In this economy, that's hard to take."
Government officials, too, are worried because the village and local school district will be losing the income from annual payments in lieu of taxes that the auto maker has been making to them. Last year General Motors paid North Tarrytown $1.1 million, or slightly more than 20 percent of the municipality's annual budget. Also last year, according to the agreement, the company wrote a check to the Union Free School District of the Tarrytowns for $1.9 million toward its budget of $22,669,062.
In the departure agreement hammered out before the lawsuit, General Motors had offered to continue local payments worth an estimated $5 million for two years after it closes the plant. For now, though, all deals are off until the matter of the local ordinance is settled, Ms. Holmes said.
 
A Better Mood at the Plant
 But while the village and the auto maker argue over in-ground pollutants, tax abatements and departure packages, workers like Angelo Valletta, 46, say they are worried about "more important things, like the rest of our lives."
"I'm talking about my retirement, what I'm going to do once this place shuts down," said Mr. Valletta, who has worked for General Motors for 28 years.
Mr. Valletta, a resident of New Windsor, in Orange County, said he was grateful for the year's extension at the plant, which would give him the 30 years he needed to be eligible for a retirement package. "It gives me time to think, to get ready," he said. "I want to sell my house and go to Florida, where it's cheaper to live."
He said the mood at the plant was upbeat since General Motors announced it would stay open a year past its original summer 1995 shutdown. It has given workers time to sign up for programs at a learning center at the plant, to sharpen their English and reading skills, he said.
 
A State Involvement
 "We keep telling everyone, 'Prepare yourself,' " said Mr. Valletta, a benefits worker for Local 664 of the United Auto Workers. "But you know, some people think this plant will never close. Who know's what's going to happen from one day to the next?"
The State Office of Economic Development is working with the auto maker and village officials to salvage the agreement worked out before the lawsuit was filed last month. "Hopefully, this is just a temporary parting of the ways," said Steven B. Vitoff, a spokesman for the office.
In addition to continuing some payments to the village, General Motors had also agreed, as part of the departure agreement, to sell a 1.5-acre riverfront parking lot to the village or a designee of the village, so that it could be developed as a source of tax revenues, and to help find tenants for the site.
Moreover, it said it would allow a part of the site to become part of a countywide Greenway linking village landmarks with parks and stretches of riverside property.
The village has until the first week in December to rescind the law and resume negotiations before General Motors moves forward on the suit, Ms. Holmes, the spokeswoman, said.

Mr. Valletta, a General Motors employee for 28 years, spoke of the company's decision to keep the plant open for another year. "It gives me time to think, to get ready," he said. "I want to sell my house and go to Florida, where it's cheaper to live." (Susan Harris for The New York Times) (P.23)

IN HISTORY'S SHADOW
An American Odyssey.
By John Connally with Mickey Herskowitz.
Illustrated. 386 pp. New York:
Hyperion. $24.95. 
 NOTHING John B. Connally ever did was as disarming as the way he behaved when he went bankrupt in the Texas real-estate bust of the late 1980's. It was a maximally humiliating situation: the confidant to Presidents and billionaires, 70 years old and still imperious, Connally had managed to fall into a financial ruin so complete that he had to sell off the furniture on his ranch. But he and his wife, Nellie, went so far as to serve as hosts at the auction of all their property. They never displayed bitterness or meanness; Connally even appeared in good-humored advertisements as a kind of living reminder that there is life and even a measure of dignity after bankruptcy.
"In History's Shadow: An American Odyssey" is a little like the auction. Connally's sense of his own stature was such that if he'd had his druthers, he might have produced a deadly serious memoir aimed at enhancing his historical reputation, like the books of Richard M. Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson or Henry A. Kissinger -- or no memoir at all, just noble silence. Instead, before his death in June, he submitted with good cheer to the publishing routine that, for a famous person, pays best: the breezy as-told-to book laced with juicy tidbits. (The "to whom," in this case, is Mickey Herskowitz, who has previously written books with Bette Davis, Dan Rather and Howard Cosell.) There is far more material in these pages on what happened when Connally was wounded at John F. Kennedy's side in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963 -- a subject that Connally was proud of never having discussed publicly -- than on what he did in his three terms as Governor of Texas. Somehow, though, he emerges pretty gracefully from an exercise that could have embarrassed and diminished him. He gives up the goods -- including an account of the teen-age suicide of his firstborn child -- without ever seeming cheap, petty or bathetic.
Though he was raised in rural poverty, Connally spent his entire adult life as a Texas Ubermensch. He was elected president of the University of Texas Student Assembly on the same day in 1938 that Nellie was elected Sweetheart of the university; and a year later, at the age of 22, he was the chief aide to Texas's brightest young politician, Congressman Lyndon Johnson, and so was right in the middle of everything that important Texans were doing. Connally was so spectacularly handsome and commanding that he was being talked about as a prospective governor or even President not long before he was out of his 20's. He personified the great Texas progressions of his lifetime, from poor to rich, country to city, small-time to worldly.
Therefore the most interesting question about Connally is why he never got the part he looked and acted. It is a question that obviously occurred to Connally himself a time or two, and he answers it in his book in two ways, one direct and the other almost unconscious.
In Connally's mind, his Presidential prospects were a secondary casualty of Lee Harvey Oswald. (As assassination buffs know, Connally did not believe in the Warren Commission's "single bullet theory," but he says here that he did believe Oswald, acting alone, was the assassin. Oswald, he thinks, fired three shots, hitting Kennedy twice and himself once.) Had Kennedy been re-elected in 1964, the nation in 1968 could easily have turned to the popular Democratic Governor of Texas as a replacement. But Lyndon Johnson's Presidency left people in no mood to consider another Texan for the top job in the 1960's.
Connally's next big chance seemed to be 1976, at what would have been the end of Richard Nixon's second term; Mr. Nixon, he says, had made Gerald R. Ford Vice President on the understanding that Connally, who had become a Republican in 1973, would be the anointed successor. Watergate spoiled that plan. In 1980, the year Connally actually ran for the Republican nomination, he could not beat Ronald Reagan, partly because as a party switcher he was regarded with suspicion by Republicans and partly because he had been tried, though acquitted, on bribery charges. That was the end of the story, though he does offer as a parting shot the observation that Mr. Reagan was not "as good a president as I would have been."
The real problem, though, may have been the profound ambivalence about politics that is a running motif of "In History's Shadow." The Presidents Connally knew best -- John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon -- were, for better or worse, completely dedicated to the profession of politics. But Connally was never willing to descend fully to the perilous depths of total commitment. He took nine years out of his rising period during the 1950's to work for Sid Richardson, the Texas wildcatter who founded what is now the Bass brothers fortune, because he feared "the desperation that comes with being a man of modest means in politics." He found it distasteful to go to football games with Johnson because all Johnson wanted to do there was talk politics. He urged Kennedy not to ride in the motorcade in Dallas because it would be "exhausting . . . a powerful psychic drain," and instead to save his energies for meeting with businessmen. He decided to leave the governorship because "whatever I was able to accomplish in solving the problems of the state, there would always be new problems" -- a thought it is impossible to imagine Lyndon Johnson having.
Connally metes out praise by way of variations on adjectives like firm, elegant, disciplined, sophisticated, ruthless, distant and, above all, tough -- proconsular words. He found something weak and petty about the basic practice of politics; he absorbed almost unthinkingly (because it fit his nature so perfectly) the main idea of the Texas Democratic Party in its all-powerful heyday in the post-World War II years, which was that the purpose of government is to help business. Connally's most lasting achievement is having helped to build the University of Texas into a national institution during his governorship, but he did this, he explains, only because "industry follows brainpower." His "message" in the 1980 campaign was, to Clinton-era sensibilities, shockingly narrow-gauged: "If you're not willing to get into the political arena and defend your business, to defend your interests, to defend this economic system, then you're not worthy to head any corporation in America, in my judgment."
When Connally erred, which was pretty often, it was in the direction of acting excessively decisive and tycoonlike. He advised Johnson to threaten to drop nuclear weapons on Hanoi, and Mr. Nixon to burn the Watergate tapes. In December 1990 he and a Texas oilman friend, on a private mission to free the Middle East hostages, called on Saddam Hussein in Baghdad ("He was calm, deliberate, restrained, and gave the impression of being totally in command of himself") and told him that "the average person in the United States or elsewhere knows little of your disagreement with the Kuwaitis" -- this as his country was gearing up for war over just that issue.
It is sometimes amazing how little he knew about life outside the Texas-Washington-corporate nexus; while describing his work wheedling Government jobs for constituents when he was an aide to Johnson, he tosses off as an aside that "those were the days before Civil Service" -- which actually was founded in 1883. No doubt Connally's piling up of $300 million in debt in the early 1980's was another example of his tendency to view swagger as the one key to life.
Once in 1973 Mr. Nixon invited Connally, who was practicing law in Texas at the time, after having served as Mr. Nixon's Secretary of the Treasury, to join him and Leonid Brezhnev on a cross-country flight on Air Force One, so that the Soviet leader could meet the man he probably would be dealing with in the late 1970's. "As we flew over the Grand Canyon, the three of us talked about matters relating to the rearrangement of the universe," Connally reports, the tone indicating that this was the milieu for which he was best suited. But the truth is that for most of his life Connally wound up playing, against type, the second lead to men you'd think he would have outshined: Lyndon Johnson, Sid Richardson, Richard Nixon; even in his final, real-estate phase, his protege, Ben Barnes, was the managing partner of the business. In the last pages of this book, Connally tosses bouquets to President Clinton, Ross Perot and Ann Richards, the Governor of Texas, perhaps to indicate his willingness to play consigliere. How could these people have been John Connally's bosses, instead of his being theirs? Because they were willing to put ambition ahead of dignity, and he wasn't.
