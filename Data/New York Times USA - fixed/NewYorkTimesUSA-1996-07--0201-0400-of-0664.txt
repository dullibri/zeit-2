Mickey Hart's New Life
 "There really is life after the Grateful Dead," said Mickey Hart, who played percussion with the Dead from 1967 until its breakup last year after the death of Jerry Garcia. 
 "I've been in the Grateful Dead my whole life," he continued. "It's had its ups and downs, and it has taken almost all of my time. Now that the Grateful Dead isn't there, it opens up a whole other set of possibilities."
But the projects Mr. Hart is now involved with seem Deadlike. This afternoon at Liberty State Park in Jersey City, his group, Mickey Hart's Mystery Box, is to appear at the Furthur Festival, which includes Ratdog (led by another former Dead member, Bob Weir), Bruce Hornsby, Los Lobos and Hot Tuna. For an encore, members of these bands plan to indulge in a jam session; past shows have featured renditions of such Dead staples as "Truckin' " and "Fire on the Mountain."
"This festival is gaining its own consciousness," the 46-year-old Mr. Hart said during a telephone interview from a tour stop in Indiana. "The musicians are meeting in buses and working stuff out and trying to make the show better. In the Grateful Dead world, we were kept from interacting like this on tour because of the pressures of being the Grateful Dead. This is very refreshing to me and Bob. It's easier. My only gripe is that we don't play long enough."
The music of Mr. Hart's new band is quite different from the American-roots musical journeys of the Grateful Dead. The product of four years of precision work (he spent two and a half weeks just preparing a piano with small percussive objects for the album's tribute to John Cage), "Mickey Hart's Mystery Box" (Rykodisc) offers a mix of world percussion and soulful pop vocals. Nonetheless, Mystery Box also retains strong connections with Mr. Hart's past, mainly because the former Dead lyricist Robert Hunter wrote the words.
The emotional centerpiece of the album is "Down the Road," in which Mr. Hart, who has rarely recorded his voice, gently speaks, over the soulful cooing of the Mint Juleps, about a strange sound he hears coming from the sky. "It sounded like Garcia, but I couldn't see the face," he intones. "Just the beard and the glasses and a smile in empty space."
Though Mr. Hart seems happy for the opportunity to move into the next phase of his life, he says that not a day goes by when he doesn't think of Jerry Garcia. "This morning I was looking at NBC," he said. "My eyes are not like they used to be, and the sunny weather symbol over Florida, it had glasses on and it looked just like him. I said, 'There's Jerry over Florida.' "
Next week, Mr. Hart's music is to be performed at a place where Deadheads will be a minority: he will be in Atlanta for the opening ceremonies of the Olympic Games, for which he composed the call to nations. "Much of the percussion of the world I tried to put out there on that field," he said. "But I refrained from using the military: I don't want the world to march. I want the world to dance."
 
Days of Music
 The second annual testament to the madness and ambition of New York club owners begins next week: from Sunday to Saturday (July 14 to 20), 450 bands have been booked in 17 clubs in Manhattan and one in Hoboken, N.J. Unlike its predecessor, the New Music Seminar, this Macintosh New York Music Festival is not just for the music industry. It is also offering $50 passes -- 3,000 of them -- that allow bearers access to all these concerts as well as to a three-day symposium on the Internet and its applications to music.
There will also be related concerts at more than a dozen clubs around the world, most of which will be broadcast live on the Internet. At 7 on Wednesday morning, for example, anyone with a good alarm clock and enough computer power can watch the Dynamite Masters of Blues Quartet, a noisy Japanese guitar band that has never performed in the United States, perform at the Club Milk in Tokyo. "I can foresee a day when other countries start thinking of the festival as a showcase to the world," said Michael Dorf, the owner of the Knitting Factory, who organized the festival with Andrew Rasiej, an owner of Irving Plaza.
Despite Mr. Dorf's global ambitions, one of the most important events taking place at the festival is strictly a local one. On Monday at 4 P.M. at the Bottom Line, club owners, clubgoers, politicians, law enforcers and community board members are getting together for a public Quality of Nightlife Forum to discuss the future of clubs and bars in Manhattan.
David Hershkovits, the publisher of Paper magazine, who organized the conference along with several club owners, said that between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's quality of life campaign, the increasing power of community boards over the approval of liquor and cabaret licenses and stepped-up scrutiny by law-enforcement officials, it is more difficult than ever to open a club or bar safely and keep it open profitably. In addition, Peter Gatien's recent indictment for conspiracy to sell the drug Ecstasy at two of the clubs he owns, Limelight and Tunnel, has saddled clubs with the worst reputation they have had in years.
The conference has set goals: to form an alliance of clubs and bars; to convince the city and community boards that clubs are an economic and cultural boon; to teach clubgoers the importance of behaving responsibly and respectfully, especially outside these places, and to ask the city to cooperate by making public kiosks available for promotional posters. (Most flyers posted on lampposts and buildings are illegal.)
Mr. Gatien is to appear at the forum along with Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan borough president; members of every community board below 57th Street; representatives of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, and employees and owners of the Spy Bar, Don Hill's, Wetlands, Irving Plaza, Sound Factory and more than a dozen other nighttime haunts.
 
Soundlab's PartyUnder a Bridge
 For those who have found the floating art, technology and experimental dance music party called Soundlab too crowded or too hard to find, it is holding a blowout with four sound systems and some of Manhattan's most innovative disk jockeys (Spooky, Olive, the Bedouin and Soulslinger) on Friday night at the Anchorage, under the Brooklyn Bridge, from 10 P.M. to 6 A.M.
For those who have never heard of Soundlab, this group of multimedia artists, technology whizzes, writers, musicians and disk jockeys involved with it may be the most innovative and important underground cultural collective working in Manhattan. At previous Soundlab parties, musicians known for their work in the avant-garde in the 1970's learned to accept the disk jockey as an equal in improvisation while music fans learned that sound can't always be separated from visual and spatial stimuli.

HEADLINE: Pollution Backsliding in New Jersey

 BODY:
The people who live in New Jersey care about the environment. They have voted for some of the toughest pollution controls in the country. Their Congressional delegation, including many Republicans, has honorably resisted the G.O.P.'s yearlong effort to dismantle the nation's basic environmental laws. There is no mystery to this. New Jersey is a densely populated state with an economy dominated by petrochemical complexes and other heavy polluters. It has more Superfund sites than any other state, and 85 percent of its waterways remain unfishable and unswimmable.
For obvious reasons, New Jersey residents do not want to move backward. But, environmentalists complain, the state's Governor, Christine Todd Whitman, does. In keeping with her campaign pledge to make New Jersey more "business friendly," Mrs. Whitman has proposed changes in the state laws governing water quality and waste disposal that, her critics say, would erase 25 years of slow but steady progress. 
 As detailed in a recent account by Jennifer Preston of The Times, the new rules would allow private industry and municipal waste treatment plants to discharge more toxic substances into state waterways than they can under current law. Maximum fines and penalties would be reduced.
Meanwhile, in her budget for the next fiscal year, Mrs. Whitman has ordered major staff reductions at the state's Department of Environmental Protection, including lawyers who prosecute violations and scientists who monitor air and water quality. This angered even some Republicans in Trenton, and last week legislators voted to restore $7 million of Mrs. Whitman's proposed $17.2 million cut. Mrs. Whitman, unrepentant, said she would not use the money to prevent layoffs.
The Governor makes no apologies for her basic strategy. She says the old-fashioned command-and-control approach to environmental regulation requires industry to obtain dozens of individual permits to stay in business, encourages endless litigation and drives prospective employers away. Instead of closely regulating what comes out of every sewer line and smokestack, Mrs. Whitman prefers a more flexible system in which all the "stakeholders" -- government, industry and environmentalists -- sit down together and establish general goals. Regulators would monitor the end results but not oversee every step of the process.
On water pollution, her plan is to move away from monitoring individual discharges to what she calls a comprehensive "watershed approach," managing not only industrial and municipal discharges but all sources of pollution, including runoffs from farms and lawns.
 In theory, there is nothing wrong with Mrs. Whitman's strategy. Indeed, Carol Browner, administrator of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other state governors, have been looking for ways to replace the old system of regulatory micromanagement with broader, more cooperative approaches.
In practice, however, there is one serious flaw in Mrs. Whitman's plan. It is not even close to becoming a reality. Except for one working group, which has met infrequently, there is no machinery in place that would enable business, environmentalists and regulators to set common goals. There are no "watershed" programs, even on paper. The idea of resolving disputes through mediation instead of the courts is in its infancy.
Until Mrs. Whitman can add real substance to her ideas, it would be sheer folly to weaken existing regulations and cripple the agencies that enforce them.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Pressured by Fears That Strength Hurts Exporters

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower yesterday, pressured for a second day by fears among big United States exporters about the currency's strength and by a growing conviction that Germany was unlikely to lower interest rates soon.
In late trading yesterday in New York, the dollar stood at 110.30 Japanese yen, unchanged from Tuesday. The dollar traded at 1.5250 German marks, down from 1.5263 marks. The British pound rose to $1.5525 from $1.5490. 
 The dollar continued to be weighed down by concerns expressed by big American exporters that the currency's recent strength against the yen is hurting them by making their products cost more in Japan. The dollar touched 111.16 yen Monday, its highest level in nearly two and a half years.
Donald V. Fites, the chairman and chief executive of Caterpillar Inc. told a business meeting in Japan on Tuesday that the current level of the dollar against the yen could erase the recent signs of improvement in the trade imbalance between the United States and Japan.
Yesterday, Mr. Fites released a survey of American executives showing they would like to see the dollar trade between 90 yen and 100 yen. And Albert M. Chambers, a senior official at the Ford Motor Company, said that the current exchange rate was hurting American auto makers in Japan and that the United States Government knew it.
"The dollar has been moving off of what U.S. corporate leaders are saying," said Lizbeth Goldberg, an assistant vice president at the New York branch of Hypo Bank.
Other analysts, however, said the statements by the executives were merely justifications to sell the dollar and lock in its recent gains. They said the dollar was more vulnerable to weakness if United States or Japanese monetary officials expressed similar concerns.
"Someone like Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has a lot more pull than some guy who wants to sell more tractors," said Tad Haley, a trader at the New York branch of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.
Further pressuring the dollar was sentiment that Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, would choose to keep interest rates unchanged at its regular policy-making council meeting today.

HEADLINE: Japanese Trade Practices on Trial

 BODY:
The United States and Japan meet today in Geneva to begin a process of resolving their latest trade dispute without the destructive bombast that has marked their previous disagreements. The Clinton Administration properly decided to take its unfair trade practices case against Fuji Photo Film and the Japanese Government to the World Trade Organization rather than imposing sanctions. American sanctions would violate international trade rules and make Washington's bullying tactics the issue rather than Japan's suspicious trade activities.
The Eastman Kodak Company, with considerable supporting evidence, says that the Japanese Government conspired with Fuji to block Kodak's access to the Japanese film market. The conspiracy began, Kodak says, in the late 1960's after Japan agreed under pressure from its allies to open up its economy to foreign investment. But as Kodak documents show, the Japanese Government rigged rules so that the likes of Kodak would be shut out. 
 Kodak offers a bill of particulars to support its claim. The company asserts that the Japanese Government helped build a distribution system for film that excluded Kodak, and that Japanese rules prevented Kodak from investing in Japanese enterprises, blocking an easy way to break into a foreign market. Laws prohibiting large retail outlets denied Kodak access to stores with enough shelf space to carry foreign brands. Finally, Kodak could not easily undersell Fuji because Government officials helped Japanese companies fix retail prices.
Fuji disputes Kodak's evidence point by point, charging that marketing incompetence, not Japanese conspiracy, limited Kodak's market share. Fuji also contends that Kodak has shut it out of markets in the United States -- a charge that was undermined this week when Fuji announced that it had outbid Kodak to buy the photo finishing plants of Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, and to provide Wal-Mart with photo finishing supplies.
The W.T.O. was created to sort out trade disputes. The antitrust violations at the heart of the Kodak case do not fit comfortably within the W.T.O.'s jurisdiction. But the United States can make the compelling argument that Japanese behavior over three decades effectively nullified its promise to lower tariffs and other trade barriers. The Administration can further argue that Japanese rules favor domestic companies, which is a clear violation of W.T.O. standards.
The Kodak case asks the W.T.O., in effect, to pass judgment on the way Japan does business. That may be a stretch for the fledgling organization, but resolving tricky disputes in an impartial manner was precisely why more than 100 countries created it. The United States will now put the W.T.O. to its first important test.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
China Shuns U.S. Partners for 100-Seat Jet

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 10

 BODY:
China's main manufacturer of civil aircraft announced today that it would team up with European and Singaporean partners to build a planned 100-seat commercial jet, dealing a blow to the Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
"The partners have reached consensus to research and manufacture the 100-seat aircraft," said Li Jianduo, spokesman for the manufacturer, Aviation Industries of China. 
 The partnership announced today represents a significant step forward in China's effort to become a key competitor for the potentially huge business in Asian aircraft orders. Talks with South Korea on an alliance to develop a passenger plane for the Asian market broke down last month.
The long-awaited decision is regarded as a boon to the European partners -- British Aerospace P.L.C., Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. The project will give them greater access to the Chinese and Southeast Asian markets, where air traffic is expected to grow most quickly. Singapore Technologies will be the other partner in the project.
European and American jet makers had competed for two years to join China in building the 100-seater.
"In the long term, it's a big deal for the Europeans and for Airbus," said Wiener Barnaby, an analyst with Credit Lyonnais Securities, referring to Airbus Industrie, the European consortium owned by Aerospatiale and British Aerospace in partnership with Deutsche Aerospace and Construcciones Aeronauticas of Spain.
For Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, the Chinese decision represents a setback as they try to expand in Asia.
"Boeing is disappointed," said Zheng Ling, a spokesman for the American company in Beijing. "Right now, we are evaluating the market, and we haven't decided to go ahead with production of a 100-seat aircraft." Boeing does not now make a passenger jet that small.
Last month, Boeing officials conceded that they had lost the race to join China in building the planes. In April, Aerospatiale, a French state company, signed a preliminary agreement with China.
Don Hanson, spokesman for the Douglas Aircraft division of McDonnell Douglas, told The Associated Press that the company did not enter into serious negotiations with China for a 100-seat jet.
The Chinese project has been estimated at $2.5 billion. While the details of the partnership were not disclosed, The South China Morning Post of Hong Kong reported today that the Chinese company would hold a 45 percent stake, the European partners, 40 percent, and the Singapore company, 15 percent.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	Airline Suspends Orders
LONDON, July 10 (Reuters) -- British Airways, which is in talks with its pilots to avert a threatened strike, said today that it had suspended aircraft orders. "The board decided to defer all aircraft investment decisions until the financial consequences of the dispute could be assessed," a spokeswoman said.
British Airways has about $10 billion worth of orders with Boeing and has informed that company of its decision, she said. The airline has 44 planes on order with Boeing and options for 24 more.
Talks between British Airways and the pilots' union continued today in an effort to resolve a pay dispute that led to last week's vote authorizing a strike on July 16.
In New York, shares of Boeing fell 12.5 cents today, closing at $90.25.

HEADLINE: Hartford to Seek Voluntary Desegregation

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

 BODY:
Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut said yesterday that he wanted to use voluntary measures to remedy the segregation in Hartford schools that the state's high court ruled unconstitutional, such as letting urban parents choose to send their children to suburban schools.
"The real solution to better schools is still, in my opinion, more discipline, more parental involvement, and school choice responds to a lot of those issues," Mr. Rowland said while discussing the decision on a WTIC radio talk show. 
 Connecticut's Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that racial segregation in Hartford's public schools deprived students of the equal educational opportunities guaranteed by the state Constitution, and it asked the state's General Assembly to find a way to desegregate Hartford's schools. But it offered no remedies itself.
In the wake of the ruling, many politicians agreed with the Governor that voluntary measures were preferred, and that achieving desegregation by assigning students to travel between city and suburbs was unacceptable. Whites make up less than 5 percent of Hartford's public school enrollment.
The already daunting challenge of desegregating Hartford's schools is complicated by the changing demographics of suburbia. Just as whites began leaving Hartford for the suburbs after World War II in a voluntary movement that led to segregated city schools, a wave of minority families have been leaving Hartford for its suburbs since the late 1980's.
In the seven years since the desegregation lawsuit known as Sheff v. O'Neill was filed, so many minority families have moved to the older suburbs bordering Hartford that their schools are now confronting racial-balance issues of their own. In East Hartford, for example, the percentage of minority students rose to 49.3 percent in 1995, from 23.1 percent in 1989. In West Hartford, the proportion rose to 22.7 percent, from 12.1 percent.
The implications of this latest population shift can be seen in the problems besetting Project Concern, a 30-year-old voluntary integration program between Hartford and its suburbs that is often mentioned as the obvious model for quickly responding to the court order.
Since 1966, the nationally heralded program has enabled 6,000 black children from Hartford to attend suburban schools; at its high point in 1978, 1,175 children were voluntarily bused to 13 suburban districts, some of them among the most highly regarded in the nation.
But when school resumes at the end of summer, fewer than 500 children will be enrolled. The decline, said the program's administrator, Mary Carroll, is due to problems that would be difficult to overcome even if the Legislature seized on Project Concern as a solution.
The greatest problem, Ms. Carroll said, is that suburban districts are running out of classroom seats as their enrollments surge while the city's falls, leaving no room for new Project Concern students. The movement of minority families from the city to suburban towns, made possible by declining rents throughout the economically stressed region, has also diminished the appeal of an integration program for those towns.
West Hartford, for example, once had more than 350 Project Concern students, but as it has struggled with crowding and racial balance in its own schools, the number has fallen to 80 as the town accepts only half a dozen new students each year. Manchester, where the minority enrollment has more than doubled since 1989, had 98 students as recently as 1992 but no longer takes new ones.
And as families that can afford to leave Hartford do so, the increasing poverty of those who remain means fewer Hartford children qualify for Project Concern, Ms. Carroll said. Many children have social or developmental problems that disqualify them, or lack the strong family support needed to commute to a distant school, she said.
A decline in financing has left the program itself less able to help; once it employed 56 paraprofessionals to work with the children in suburban schools, but now it has 7.
"The city is spiraling down and we're trying to draw from that population without any support for them," Ms. Carroll said.
The biggest minority group in Hartford schools -- Hispanic children, 49.9 percent of the enrollment -- is largely excluded from Project Concern. Historically, the program has been aimed at blacks, the dominant minority group in the 60's. In addition, suburban schools don't have bilingual programs and so do not accept children who aren't fluent in English, she said.
"We can't expand without the support services, and we can't do it without opening it to the Hispanic community," she said.
Yesterday the Attorney General, Richard Blumenthal, was still studying the court ruling before deciding whether to ask the Supreme Court to reconsider it. "We believe the court would be very unlikely to grant a motion to reconsider," he said.
The decision cannot be appealed to the United States Supreme Court because the suit was based on Connecticut's constitution and was tried in state courts.
After speaking on several radio shows, Mr. Blumenthal said, "People are reacting very reasonably and positively, and that fact is reassuring."
The Connecticut Education Commissioner, Theodore S. Sergi, said: "I think there's general agreement that nothing the court said really has an effect on school in Connecticut in September. There shouldn't be any sense out there of confusion or concern about that."

Poland Joining O.E.C.D., A Step Further Into Europe

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW, July 10

 BODY:
In a major psychological boost for its increasingly healthy economy, Poland is set to join one of the world's premier capitalist clubs, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
At a ceremony on Thursday in Paris, the Poles are expected to sign an agreement to join the O.E.C.D., a group of 25 relatively wealthy nations that acts as a meeting place and research center for the industrial world. 
 Poland, with a population of about 40 million and a fast-growing economy, will be the third formerly Communist country to become part of the O.E.C.D., following the Czech Republic and Hungary.
Membership confers a stamp of approval on Poland's free-market reforms, which resulted in 7 percent growth last year, the most robust in Europe. Growth is expected to slip to about 5 percent this year and pick up slightly in 1997.
Poland was the first country in Eastern Europe to recover from the severe slump in growth after the fall of Communism in 1989, according to the research unit of Deutsche Bank, which added that private business there now generated about 60 percent of the gross domestic product.
In April, Standard & Poor's, citing Poland's economic growth and improved balance of payments, raised Poland's credit rating to BBB-, an investment grade, from BB.
In another sign of confidence in the Polish economy, European and Asian investors snapped up a $164.4 million Eurobond issue by Poland on Tuesday. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and CS First Boston jointly led the deal, Poland's second such issue.
To become an O.E.C.D. member, Poland had to meet the organization's principal policies, which required considerable legislative changes. Many of these changes, ranging from freeing the movement of capital to lifting quotas on foreign audiovisual material, have been seen here as a trial run for what Poland hopes will be its eventual membership in the European Union.
"We feel pretty good about the steps Poland has taken," said David Aaron, the American representative to the O.E.C.D. in Paris. "They have accepted basic things that are important to us."
Mr. Aaron said Poland had gone further than some current European Union members to meet some of the requirements.
But not all the changes, which were opposed by some political factions in the coalition Government of former Communists and the Peasants' Party, were as sweeping as some foreign investors in Poland would have liked.
Under procedures introduced to comply with the O.E.C.D. policies, a foreigner can now buy an apartment and as much as 4,000 square meters of urban land without a special permit. Mr. Aaron said the Polish Government had pledged to put foreign investors who wanted to acquire larger parcels of land on a fast track for a permit.
But American lawyers working with foreign investors in Warsaw, said the easing of restrictions on real estate ownership was not enough. Under European Union regulations, a foreign company can purchase real estate without any permit.
In banking matters, the Polish central bank now gives licenses for foreign bank branches only to those ready to invest in troubled Polish banks. The Warsaw Government won a concession from the O.E.C.D. that would allow its banking industry time to improve before allowing the unrestricted opening of foreign bank branches. That will be delayed until the end of 1998.

The S.E.C. says it happened: a corner in the Treasury market.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
CORNER the Treasury market?
It sounds impossible, but Federal regulators said yesterday that it was done three years ago by Fenchurch Capital Management, a Chicago company that runs two commodity funds. 
 Fenchurch, without admitting or denying anything, agreed to pay a $600,000 fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Fenchurch's president, Marcus A. Hutchins, agreed to pay a $200,000 fine levied by the Chicago Board of Trade. Fenchurch also consented to a Federal court injunction sought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In a corner, an investor gets control of so much of a specific security that others cannot obtain it, or at least cannot do so without paying an outrageous price.
The C.F.T.C. said that in June 1993, when that month's futures contract for 10-year Treasury notes was expiring, Fenchurch cornered the market in a key Treasury note. The result was that its pools made a lot of money while traders on the other side lost a lot.
"Manipulation of this sort can and did affect improperly the value of the bargain struck before trading had expired," said Geoffrey Aronow, the C.F.T.C.'s director of enforcement. He added that the enforcement action, taken in concert with the S.E.C. and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, would "let market participants know that we will act to insure the markets remain free of illegitimate forces."
The futures market in 10-year Treasury notes is a large one, although not as large as in some other contracts. A buyer of a futures contract is betting that interest rates on such notes will decline, while a seller is betting they will rise. Most traders in futures contracts close out their position before the contracts expire.
But if the contracts are not liquidated, the sellers of each contract must deliver actual Treasury notes to the owners of the futures contracts.
The Board of Trade, where the contracts trade, has a list of what Treasury notes can be delivered to satisfy each month's futures contract. Brokers routinely keep track of which Treasury note would be the cheapest to buy to satisfy a contract.
As the June 1993 contract was expiring, Fenchurch held 12,700 contracts -- covering $1.27 billion of notes -- and it wanted delivery of Treasury notes. The cheapest to deliver was the note maturing in February 2000, with a coupon of 8.5 percent. (Don't ask why a note with less than seven years to maturity can satisfy a contract for 10-year notes. That is just one of the mysteries of the financial futures market.)
Those who had sold contracts, and were required to deliver notes, began to scramble to find the February 2000 notes, seeking to either buy or borrow them. But there were few to be found. As a result, many had to buy the next-cheapest note, an 8.875 percent note that matured in May 2000.
By the C.F.T.C. account, getting that note cost an extra 5/32 on the price of a bond, or 15.6 cents for $100 face value. Fifteen cents is not enough to make a phone call, but that translates into $156.25 a contract. And Fenchurch ended up getting the better Treasury notes to satisfy 4,800 of its contracts. That calculates to an advantage for Fenchurch of $750,000.
Was Fenchurch just lucky? Not the way the regulators see it. While the February 2000 note was originally issued in a volume of $10.7 billion, a lot of the notes had been cut up by Wall Street to produce zero-coupon securities, and others were tied up in accounts that did not trade them.
As the June contract expired, Fenchurch controlled $1.4 billion of that issue. In the next few days, it bought or borrowed enough of them to put its position over $2 billion.
The C.F.T.C. noted that during that period Fenchurch was borrowing money and paying the normal interest rate on transactions secured by Treasury securities. But so desperate were the sellers of the contracts to get their hands on the February 2000 issue that they were willing to lend money at negative rates -- that is, pay someone to borrow -- if the borrower would post as collateral that issue. But Fenchurch chose not to take them up on that offer.
Fenchurch issued a statement that emphasized the settlement would not affect the funds it managed, and added that "we decided it was in our best interest and the best interests of our investors to settle this matter so we could move on." For the next two years, the C.F.T.C. will get detailed reports of Fenchurch's trading.
While there has been talk of cornering newly issued Treasury securities -- that was the foundation of the Salomon Brothers scandal five years ago, although no corner was proved -- this is the first time anyone has been charged with actually cornering an issue, even for a brief time. With players able to borrow billions for speculation, it appears that even the largest securities market in the world -- Treasury securities -- is vulnerable to manipulation.

HEADLINE: Punish Employers, Not Children

BYLINE: By George J. Borjas; George J. Borjas is a professor of public policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Four million illegal aliens reside in the United States, and their number grows by 300,000 every year. This is on top of the three million granted amnesty in the late 1980's.
The costs of illegal immigration in both economic and social disarray are high. That is why California voters backed Proposition 187, which denies many social benefits to illegal aliens -- including public education. 
 Now Congress has joined the fray. The House recently passed the Gallegly amendment, which would give states the right to bar illegal aliens from public schools; the measure faces a tougher time in the Senate.
Such a ban on schooling probably would prompt some people to think twice before crossing the border illegally. After all, we know that illegal immigration from Mexico responds to the price of tomatoes in the United States: there are more Border Patrol apprehensions when the price is high and farms pay more to harvest the crops. If aliens respond to the price of tomatoes, they may well respond to the cut in education benefits.
Still, is this an effective way of stopping the illegal flow? Imagine the emotional outrage when the evening news begins with a scene of two burly Border Patrol officers preventing a sobbing 7-year-old from entering a public school. This image alone, and the shameful history it evokes, suggests that this policy is not a serious attempt to curtail the illegal alien flow, for it is unlikely ever to be enforced.
The policy also fails to address the real underpinning of the illegal immigration problem: the wage gap between the United States and Mexico -- the largest between any two contiguous countries. The incentives for Mexicans to migrate are enormous. And American employers benefit from the entry of illegal aliens; a vast pool of workers keeps wages down.
So both illegal aliens and their employers want to see the tide continue. Few are penalized for breaking the law. When an illegal alien is caught, the Border Patrol sends the person back across the border; typically, the migrant tries again. Once people make it to the United States, they can easily buy fake documents and be hired by an employer who will do no more than give the papers a cursory inspection.
Illegal aliens go to emergency rooms, send their children to public schools, apply for welfare, get driver's licenses. They have frequent contact with government agencies. Yet nobody is held accountable for this large-scale law-breaking.
We need deterrence, but barring illegal aliens from our public schools is not an effective way of stopping illegal immigration. For one thing, it would have no effect on the migration of single people and childless couples. In addition, many children who live in undocumented households were born in the United States and are American citizens courtesy of the 14th Amendment, so they are automatically entitled to public education.
We could deter many more illegal aliens if we imposed substantial penalties on the employers who hire them. These companies -- agricultural enterprises, sweatshops -- get the bulk of the gains from illegal immigration but bear few of the costs.
What would happen to the demand for undocumented workers if we billed the owners of the fields where the migrants toil, and the families who hire illegal domestic help, for the expenses incurred by public schools and Medicaid?
Finally, any serious proposal must offer a way of establishing who is an illegal alien. Regardless of where we choose to catch them -- the school or the workplace -- we need to be able to tell them apart from legal immigrants.
We have yet to grapple with this troublesome detail, which raises the specter of a national identification system. But we cannot tackle the problem of illegal immigration as long as we skirt this issue.
We do need to discourage illegal aliens from entering the country, and encourage those already here to leave. Barring them from public schools, however, is more symbol than substance.
The fact that it has become the centerpiece of the current debate implies that Congress is not yet serious about stopping the tide of illegal immigrants.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Rise Again; Fed Rate Action Is Doubted

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher yesterday for a second consecutive day, bolstered by speculation that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to raise interest rates in the next few weeks.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 17/32, to 86 22/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 7.08 percent, from 7.13 percent on Tuesday. 
 With little economic data available to give direction, the market focused its attention on an article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday about a new Federal Reserve study. The study, according to The Journal, discusses a new approach to monetary policy, arguing that when inflation is relatively low, as is the case now, policy makers should refrain from taking action.
The study reflects the thinking of several top Fed policy makers, although the theory -- called "opportunistic disinflation" -- does not represent current Fed policy, The Journal said.
Some market participants interpreted the news of the study to mean that the Fed was not in any rush to raise interest rates, as had been expected following Friday's surprisingly strong employment report.
If the Fed were to adopt such a policy, said Jack Ablin, director of fixed income and senior fund manager at the Private Bank at Bank of Boston, "it puts a rate increase on hold and that means the Fed will rely on the market to slow the economy down."
Bond prices bounced higher in the afternoon after a speech by Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, comforted the market. Addressing executives and bankers in Montrose, Colo., Mr. Hoenig did not say anything new about Federal Reserve policy, but bonds traded higher on relief, said Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston.
The market is expecting the Fed to raise the Federal funds rate, the lending rate between banks for overnight loans, to 6 percent from 5.25 percent.
"If you look at where the market is today, it is in the center of a range that has been traveled over the past two years," he said.
"There is no staying power, because it has been a difficult market to trade all year, choppy and with little participation, and the monthly jobs data determining the top and bottom.
"Most market participants may be right about where the market is headed, but because the trading is so choppy, it is difficult to stay in the game without getting stopped."
Larry M. Berman, senior fixed-income analyst with Technical Data of Boston, was more optimistic.
"The technicals have aligned bullishly," he said, "and we cannot rule out a test of resistance in the 6.90 percent yield range again."
In the Treasury futures market, the September 30-year bond contract finished 2/32 off the session high of 107 18/32. It closed up at 107 16/32.
Robin Mesch, chief fixed-income analyst with Thomson Research of Boston, said the rally was likely to meet resistance at 107 23/32 to 108.
"The first approach into the region was met with enough selling to lay it sideways," she said.
"But what is noteworthy about the horizontal price action is that it was lacking the consensus of a fair price, and this tells us there is possibility for another strong run-up today," she added.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Big, Bold, Outside: Billboards Back in Fashion

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
All of a sudden, it seems, outdoor advertising is growing again to be as big as -- well, all outdoors.
For decades, outdoor billboards, signs and posters, once a vibrant and integral part of the American consumer economy, have been perceived as dull and dowdy offspring among the family of media. Television is glamorous, radio is intimate, magazines are slick, newspapers are immediate and outdoor is, at best, plain-spoken ("Eat here. Get gas.") and visible (a polite way of saying in-your-face). 
 Worse yet, outdoor advertising became embroiled in disputes over issues such as its dependence on revenue from marketers of alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, the clustering of signs for products like fortified wines and malt liquor in inner-city neighborhoods and the eye pollution caused by signs that obscured landmarks and scenic attractions.
It was all a far cry from the days when brands like Campbell's soup, Coca-Cola and Wrigley's gum were built on bold, bright images plastered on billboards along the nation's highways and so-called spectaculars in Times Square -- giant, extravagant neon signs with smoke rings and waterfalls -- came to symbolize the wonderful cacophony of New York City.
But now outdoor advertising appears to be enjoying a renaissance, reconstituted as part of a category known as out-of-home media, which also includes transit advertising and sales pitches at nontraditional sites like airports and shopping malls.
The industry's revenue last year rose 8.2 percent from 1994, according to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, a trade organization. That represented the largest one-year gain in more than a decade -- and it outpaced the growth of most other media.
The revival has attracted the attention of Wall Street as well as Madison Avenue.
In recent months, a spate of acquisitions has served to consolidate what is still a fairly fragmented industry. The most recent came late Tuesday, when Outdoor Systems Inc., a small company that completed an initial public offering of its stock only three months ago, agreed to buy the largest outdoor advertising concern in North America, the Gannett Outdoor unit of the Gannett Company.
The deal delighted investors, who pushed Outdoor Systems' shares up 32.8 percent to a close of $48.125 in trading on Nasdaq, a gain of $11.875. Gannett's shares closed at $70, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
"I don't know of another time in our industry when there's been such momentum and energy carrying us forward," Nancy J. Fletcher, president and chief executive of the Outdoor Advertising Association, said yesterday in a telephone interview from Washington.
Though outdoor advertising still faces significant drawbacks -- including persistent complaints about the exploitation of spaces that ought not to be commercialized -- the medium looks as if it is bouncing back.
"When you're outdoors, you're part of the environs," said Peter Arnell, chairman and executive creative director at the Arnell Group, an advertising agency in New York. "That's very different from having someone purchase something like a magazine to see your ad." Arnell has produced innovative outdoor ads for Donna Karan apparel, which featured painted skylines of Manhattan, and for Samsung home electronics products -- produced on mesh nets that are draped on the sides of buildings and "roll up," Mr. Arnell said, "like big venetian blinds."
The reasons for the seeming outdoor bounce-back include: new technologies like computer graphics, which make possible innovative signs like Samsung's and represent a marked improvement in reproduction quality over conventional paper; the wooing of advertisers like movie studios, cosmetics makers and radio stations to reduce the reliance on so-called sin products like liquor and cigarettes; success in convincing marketers to make outdoor ads integral aspects of their brand-building image campaigns, and better maintenance methods that keep signs from turning seedy.
"It's a cool medium," said Alan J. Gottesman, who follows the advertising industry as managing director of West End Communications/Consulting in New York. "A lot of it is very mundane: 'Buy pizza here now.' But I think there's a lot more life in the outdoor business than most people give it credit for.
"As all other media fractionalize, that has not diminished one iota the strategic vitality of outdoor," he added. "People still spend a lot of time in their cars."
In cities, they spend a lot of time in buses and subways, as well: Outdoor Systems will pay $690 million in cash for the Gannett outdoor operations, which include transit advertising in New York City.
"I thought it was cheap," said Arte Moreno, president and chief executive of Outdoor Systems in Phoenix, laughing.
"We went public to pay down debt and position ourselves for the big acquisition," said Mr. Moreno, who began in outdoor advertising in 1979 at Eller Outdoor and five years later joined with a partner, Bill Levine, now the chairman of Outdoor Systems, to buy up outdoor companies.
"I've been at this a long time, and the medium works," Mr. Moreno said. "It does a great job for the advertiser. We don't try to do everything, but we do try to make your name big and bold and do it efficiently."
Karl Eller, for whom Mr. Moreno once worked, endorsed his bullish view of the industry.
"The values have gone up, the prices have gone up, the multiples have gone up," said Mr. Eller, now chairman and chief executive of the Eller Media Company in Phoenix. In another outdoor mega-deal in August, he bought Patrick Media -- which traces its roots to a century-old outdoor company, Foster & Kleiser -- from the GE Capital unit of the General Electric Company. That purchase price: $518 million.
The numbers are big for a medium whose roots are in simple pitches posted along roadsides -- billboards like the famous rhyming signs for Burma-Shave, which delighted travelers memorized:
The bearded lady
Tried a jar
She's now
A famous
Movie star
Burma-Shave
"The industry has come back in vogue," said Mr. Eller, who has worked in outdoor advertising for 44 years and put Gannett in that business when he sold Eller Outdoor along with the rest of the Combined Communications Corporation to Gannett in 1979. "Things go in cycles," he added, "and right now we're in a good cycle."
Among others who are behaving as if they share Mr. Eller's beliefs is H. Wayne Huizenga, the Florida entrepreneur who founded Blockbuster Entertainment; he is forming a billboard business as part of a conglomerate he now runs, Republic Industries.
"Outdoor is having a resurgence because it offers an explosion of different possibilities," said Jack Hanrahan, senior vice president and worldwide director for out-of-home media at the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago.
Burnett buys the most outdoor advertising of any agency in America, according to the trade publication Advertising Age, spending $140.7 million in 1995, up 11.8 percent from $125.8 million in 1994. Burnett clients active on the outdoor front include the Kellogg Company, for Nutri-Grain breakfast bars; the McDonald's Corporation; the Philip Morris Companies, for brands like Marlboro cigarettes and Miller Lite beer, and Reebok International Ltd.
Among the attractive traits of outdoor advertising, Mr. Hanrahan listed "the ability to get reach and get it fast," the relatively low cost of outdoor campaigns compared with a more expensive medium like television and the flexibility to use outdoor as a mass medium or as a narrowly focused medium.
For instance, a focused test campaign for one Philip Morris brand, Altoids mints, has used outdoor advertising almost exclusively, concentrating on posters with offbeat images like an old-fashioned body builder and this two-word headline: "Nice Altoids."
"We were able to use integrated marketing data on a ZIP code basis," Mr. Hanrahan said, "buying poster panels and bus shelters in neighborhoods where our target audience of white-collar, more affluent consumers lives, works and plays." Sales of Altoids rose more than 50 percent in the markets where those outdoor ads appeared, he added.
For all the positive signs in sight for the outdoor medium -- Ms. Fletcher of the Outdoor Advertising Association answered her telephone yesterday by saying "It's a wonderful day in the neighborhood" -- problems remain.
James Dougherty, an analyst who follows agencies and advertising for Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, cited two worries.
One, he said, is that "tobacco is still a very important source of revenue, and as tobacco consumption continues to go down, advertising follows consumption." Figures compiled for the Outdoor Advertising Association by Competitive Media Reporting in New York, which tracks ad spending, show tobacco remains the second-largest ad category.
"And there's recurring governmental intervention to restrict billboards," Mr. Dougherty said, "though that's a problem more in Canada than the United States."
Mr. Hanrahan of Burnett said that clients still raise objections to the outdoor medium. One is that "to make outdoor work, you've got to have just the right creative," he said -- "short on words and impactful on visuals."
A second problem is what Mr. Hanrahan called "servicing issues: inspecting to make sure the paper isn't falling down or a tree hasn't grown in front of the billboard."
The replacement of paper with vinyl has helped keep signs tidy, he said; still, Mr. Hanrahan maintains a staff of 21 workers to inspect clients' outdoor ads.
And there is always the reality that cyclicality goes both ways.
"It's like the mid-80's," Mr. Eller said of the prices being paid for outdoor companies.
He paused. "I hope it doesn't crash and burn down the road," he added.

HEADLINE: Senate Acts on Labor Measures Opposed by Clinton and Unions

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
The Senate delivered a setback today to one measure that would undermine the strength of labor unions, but approved another that would give companies greater leeway in setting up their own employer-employee groups.
Both bills were strongly opposed by the Clinton Administration and organized labor, which said the intention was to undermine the power of unions. 
 The two votes came a day after the Senate acted on another contentious labor bill, approving an increase in the minimum wage.
The Senate rejected, 68 to 31, an effort to cut off debate and move toward final action on a bill that prohibits labor contracts to require that all employees pay union dues as a condition of employment. It fell 29 votes short of the 60 votes needed to end debate and move legislation toward a final vote.
The sponsor of the legislation, Senator Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina, said that such a law, which is now in force in 21 states, should be nationalized because "compulsory unionism violates a fundamental principle of individual liberty."
But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the bill was a "direct attack on the ability of working people to protect their economic interests."
The Senate next voted, 53 to 46, to send to President Clinton a measure that would allow employers to form groups with workers to discuss such issues as quality control.
The bill, sponsored by Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, is identical to legislation narrowly passed by the House last September. The President has said he will veto it.
Mrs. Kassebaum, who heads the Senate Labor Committee, argued that her bill only made it easier for employers and employees to cooperate in nonunion settings.
"It only represents common sense," she said. "It's not in any way designed to be a destroyer of unions."
But the Administration, in a statement, said the President would veto the legislation because it could lead to employers' creating company-dominated unions that "would undermine a 60-year tradition of collective bargaining."
Mr. Kennedy, the ranking Democrat on the Labor Committee, said there was no need for the legislation because 30,000 employers had already set up teams with workers, and the National Labor Relations Board rarely objects.
Republicans earlier tried to attach the bill to legislation to raise the minimum wage, but the President said the labor relations measure was a "poison pill" that would precipitate a veto. The Senate and House have passed the wage increase, and the President has said he will sign it.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A rigid Japan Inc. could tumble from the top industrial ranks.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
AFTER shuffling in place for much of the 1990's, the Japanese economy is growing again. But before the Japan bashers get a chance to sound the alarm, consider this analysis of the economy's long-term prospects by Robert Alan Feldman of Salomon Brothers.
"Japan will face major difficulties in maintaining living standards over the next 30 years," he wrote last month in a report to Salomon's clients. "At recent levels of productivity growth, per capita income cannot even be kept flat in the face of an aging population." 
 Mr. Feldman may be excessively pessimistic. But his story of a Japan at risk of slipping from the first rank of industrial powers is both plausible and, from the American perspective, just a bit reassuring. For what the Japanese economy apparently lacks is what the American economy has in spades: a freewheeling culture that allows rapid change and encourages bottom-up technological innovation.
Output per worker in Japan, which grew at an annual pace of 6 percent to 8 percent for much of the century, began to decelerate in the early 1970's. Indeed, Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan, noted that Tokyo lowered its official estimate of long-term growth potential for the economy to 4 percent from 6 percent in the mid-1980's and, most recently, to just 3.5 percent.
That does not shock economists enamored of the "convergence hypothesis" -- the idea that productivity tends to equalize in industrialized countries. What may be surprising is that Japanese growth seems to have stalled prematurely, at a point where output per worker is well below American levels. The current burst of growth, it is generally agreed, merely represents a return to full use of economic resources after a long recession.
What may be even more surprising is that Japanese productivity growth has gradually slowed in spite of a sustained investment effort that exceeded the pace of American capital accumulation even during the last recession. This suggests that the average return on new investments in Japan is well below the return on this side of the Pacific.
Part of the explanation is straightforward. Most recent growth in advanced economies has been based on productivity change in services, where Japan lags far behind. "They have four million more people working in retailing than they would need" were the sector as productive as its American counterpart, calculates David Hale, an economist at Zurich Kemper Investments in Chicago.
Of course, Japan is still very prosperous. And even modest continuing growth in living standards ought to sustain civility and social cohesion. But Mr. Feldman of Salomon Brothers suggests that such sanguinity may be premature.
Like other advanced economies, Japan has a rapidly aging population. But after decades of low birth rates and rising life expectancy, Japan is far ahead of the curve. Salomon Brothers projects that the labor force will shrink by 14 percent in the next 20 years while the population will grow by 4 percent. Unless Japan can raise its anemic rate of productivity growth -- six-tenths of 1 percent -- or raise consumption at the expense of savings, living standards will actually decline.
Mr. Feldman argues that clipping coupons from Japan's accumulated investment abroad -- now about $800 billion -- will not be nearly sufficient to close the gap between expected domestic output and current levels of consumption. Nor is Tokyo likely to ease the demographic crunch by liberalizing immigration, say, by admitting skilled working-age foreigners from Hong Kong. Indeed, if economic convergence is to continue, he suggests, it will depend on a combination of increased work from would-be retirees -- a matter of necessity for many since Japan's pension system is even less well financed than the Social Security system in the United States -- and revolutionary changes in the way the Japanese economy works.
Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, agrees. Along with breaking the logjam on productivity growth in services and letting Japan's grotesquely inefficient agricultural sector wither away, he argues that "Japan must become friendlier to innovation." A culture that so heavily relies on the group, glorifies consensus and concentrates financial decision-making in the hands of a few giant institutions is going to have a tough time producing its own Silicon Valleys.
Since the mid-1970's -- just when Japanese productivity growth began to tail off -- Americans have been simultaneously envious and fearful of Japan Inc., the fabled interlocking directive of business and government that keeps the production lines running on time. Now it appears this Confucian version of central planning is a grand barrier to achieving the material quality of life taken for granted in the affluent West.

HEADLINE: Late Rally Spurs Stocks, With Dow Climbing 21.79

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A late afternoon technical rally pulled stocks out of a sharp decline yesterday, allowing blue chips to finish higher.
But weak technology shares and uncertainty about the future of the economy kept the broader market mixed. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down nearly 50 points, turned around in the last hour of trading thanks to computer-generated buying programs and bargain hunting.
The Dow closed 21.79 points higher at 5,603.65. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.31 points, to 656.06.
But declining issues still outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a margin of 4 to 3. And the technology-rich Nasdaq composite index fell 12.40 points, to 1,141.19, nearly a three-month low.
"It did come back quite quickly and for a while quite vigorously, but with today's close it really has not resolved some of the near-term damage created by weakness in technology and last Friday's 115-point drop" in the Dow, said Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
Yesterday's early declines were touched off by Motorola, the big semiconductor and telecommunications company, which warned after the market closed on Tuesday that its second-quarter profits were far short of analyst estimates. The company attributed the weakness in part to slack demand for semiconductors. Shares of Motorola fell 32 percent in early trading.
The earnings shortfall erased any optimism generated by the semiconductor industry's monthly book-to-bill report for June, which showed the third straight increase in the ratio between new orders and previous orders that were billed.
Motorola recovered slightly from its low for the day but still finished 8 5/8 points lower at 57 7/8.
Motorola was the latest of several computer and technology companies that have been releasing disappointing earnings reports or forecasts in recent days.
Mary Farrell, market strategist at Paine Webber Inc., said many analysts failed to reduce their earnings predictions when the economy was moving at a slower pace earlier this year.
"These disappointments are the result of overoptimism about how many companies would be able to get through the slowdown with their earnings intact," she said.
Weakness in stocks came despite another strong day in the bond market, which has recovered some ground from Friday's steep selloff. The stock and bond markets tumbled that day on fears over inflation and interest rates generated by a surprisingly strong employment report.
"Obviously, there was widespread shock and surprise at last week's employment numbers. said Eric Miller, chief strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in San Francisco. "But now there's more a sense of confusion" about the true pace of the economy and inflation, he said.
Corporate earnings reports yesterday were not all disappointing. Abbott Labs, the drug maker, gained 7/8, to 42 1/2, after besting analyst expectations by 1 cent a share. Safeway, the supermarket chain, beat expectations by 3 cents and gained 1, to 35 1/8.
Among other individual issues, shares of Procter & Gamble closed up 1/4, at 88 1/2. Procter & Gamble told analysts that per-share earnings would rise at a slightly slower pace in the current quarter than the quarter a year earlier.The company also announced that it planned to buy back up to $1 billion of its common stock and that its board had raised the annual dividend by 12.5 percent, to $1.80 a share.
Technology stocks were weaker following Motorola's warning. America Online slipped 1/2, to 39 1/2; Texas Instruments fell 3/4, to 48 1/2; Intel dropped 1/2, to 72 7/8, and Broderbund Software Inc. slumped 1, to 31 3/4.

HEADLINE: Crime (and Punishment) Rages Anew in China

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: ZHONGSHAN, China

 BODY:
The corpse of the taxi driver was still warm in the back seat when Liao Yongxiong, age 29, pulled up in front of the Lian Yuan Street branch of the Industrial and Commerce Bank here in the car he had just hijacked.
He concealed his pistol under his jacket and went inside. The three women tellers greeted him; he was a familiar face as one of the security guards who delivered cash each week from the main office. 
 Perhaps he was smiling when he asked, "Could I use the restroom?" because the women were all too willing to unbolt the door to the security area where they were working.
He killed them swiftly, just as he had the taxi driver, with point-blank shots to the head or chest. Only one of the tellers, right before she died on the blood-spattered floor, was able to press the alarm button near her desk as Mr. Liao was escaping with a bag full of cash and securities.
Scenes like this one, which occurred on April 16 on a leafy side street here in this southern Chinese boom town, had been virtually unheard of in China during most of the last five decades. Now, suddenly, gangsters are staging a comeback in China and major crime seems out of control.
This has provoked the largest nationwide crackdown on crime in more than a decade and a wave of executions that has alarmed human rights organizations.
Serious crime and crimes involving firearms are rising at more than 20 percent a year, with more than a third of those cases involving gangs.
"We were used to seeing this kind of crime in the movies, but such things have never happened here," said Su Leting, who had just opened a new seafood restaurant and was concerned, as many members of the Zhongshan business community are, that fear of crime would drive foreign investors away. "Many foreigners have started to get nervous about social stability," said Hu Baishou, the editor of the Zhongshan Daily, whose front page carried the police composite drawing that led to Mr. Liao's arrest 54 hours after the robbery.
Before China opened to the outside world in the late 1970's, totalitarian social controls had all but eliminated major crime, drug trafficking and prostitution. But with the decentralization of authority, the disappearance of Communist-organized neighborhood committees and the reappearance of wealth, a criminal reawakening is under way.
Although the overall crime rate in China remains modest in comparison to that of United States and other Western countries, its rapid rise and a sudden surge in major crimes, including murder, armed robbery and drug trafficking, have triggered a response from Communist Party authorities.
In December 1995 and February of this year, criminal gangs in Guangdong province and in Beijing staged spectacular armored car robberies with precision planning and sophisticated arms. Together they netted more than $2 million in cash.
The holdups prompted the Ministry of Public Security to rewrite its budget plan for the next five years to buy more armor, better alarms and global-positioning devices that use satellite signals to pinpoint the location of cash-carrying vehicles, many of which are not even armored in China.
The day before the Zhongshan bank robbery, the police in Guangdong province stopped five jeeps and a truck trying to smuggle 1,200 pounds of heroin into Hong Kong for shipment to the United States and Europe. It was one of the largest single hauls of heroin in history.
In the country's rich coastal provinces, well-armed highway gangs have used prostitutes to lure truck drivers into robbery and murder traps. Kidnappers are preying on the families of China's new rich and the heroin trade has spread to all of China's large cities.
But it may have been Mr. Liao's murderous bank heist in this city where Sun Yat-sen, the father of modern China, was born that shocked the Communist leadership in Beijing into ordering a nationwide crackdown on major crimes and gangs.
The so-called "Strike Hard" crackdown has led in its first two months to tens of thousands of arrests and at least a thousand executions, more than at any time since the 1983 crackdown on crime when, diplomats say, 10,000 were put to death within a few months.
One of those executed in the current campaign was Mr. Liao, who was shot in the back of the head on April 30 by a police executioner, 15 days after the crime. Before he died, he was paraded before 5,000 Zhongshan residents at a sports stadium, where he was denounced as a "barbarian" by local Communist Party officials.
"This was a big case, so the masses' reaction was very serious," said Mr. Hu, the newspaper editor, who is also the deputy chief of propaganda for the Communist Party committee in Zhongshan. "After Liao was arrested, the people were very happy and they appealed to execute him right away."
Mr. Liao's last words to a state television interviewer were, "I do not fear death," and his dramatic appeal to his older brother to care for his 3-year-old son was captured by a local photographer.
Around the country, so many city and provincial governments have been staging execution rallies that human rights organizations are having trouble keeping an accurate tally.
Even before the crackdown, the human rights group Amnesty International was estimating at least 2,000 executions a year in China, with the death penalty being applied in many cases "as a result of political interference" and "with hardly any safeguards against miscarriages of justice."
In Shanghai, China's largest city, Fu Changlu, an administrative judge of the city's First Intermediate People's Court, said in an interview that "within the realm of the law, we have to be as severe as we can" on the perpetrators of major crime.
"Anyone who may be executed, will be executed," he said. "We will not simply give capital punishment to all criminals, but those who deserve it will get it."
An internal Public Security document issued in April characterized the rising crime rate as a outgrowth of "the accumulation of social wealth and a growing gap between rich and ordinary people" that is "forcing us to take measures to more effectively track and crush crime."
Crime is also making news. Many local Communist Party newspapers have dropped some of the dull essays on party theory from their front pages to make room for the latest criminal outrage.
One "vampire gang" in northeastern China, a newspaper reported, enslaved homeless children and sold their blood to hospitals. And in Hebei province, a night security guard was reportedly sentenced to life in prison for ringing up $6,000 in international telephone charges to telephone sex lines in the United States.
Even the Communist Party flagship paper, The People's Daily, which likes to chronicle the sins of Western society, was forced to give prominent display last winter to the murder of Li Peiyao, the vice chairman of the National People's Congress, China's parliament. Mr. Li was murdered during the burglary of his home by one of his body guards from the People's Armed Police.
Chinese experts say the number of gangs and "secret societies" are growing faster than the police can count them. One nationwide police tally found that in 1991, there were about 500 known criminal gangs comprising a few dozen members to more than 100. By 1995, the tally had leaped to about 10,000 gangs with a total membership of 500,000 to one million members.
Cai Shaoqing, a professor at Nanjing University who studies China's criminal history, says most gangs are made up of unemployed youths and former prisoners.
Not since 1983, after the first stirrings of capitalism in China had revived criminal opportunities in a huge population accustomed to deprivation, have Communist Party leaders been so compelled to whip up a national campaign against crime.
Their decision has prompted speculation about its larger political meaning.
Some experts say this crime wave provides the younger generation of Chinese leaders an opportunity to demonstrate their toughness on law-and-order issues, which are becoming more important as China's economy develops.
But the new campaign carries the unmistakable echoes of earlier power struggles in which popular revulsion to the seamy side of capitalism were exploited by party conservatives to improve their standing. This revulsion was the impetus for the 1983 crackdown.
In the culture of the Communist Party, crime is associated with the chaos and corruption of the pre-Communist era. Even the family of Deng Xiaoping, the country's paramount leader, was a victim. As a young revolutionary, Mr. Deng got word in 1938 that his father had been set upon by bandits and killed in their native Sichuan.
But the crackdown has fostered alarm among legal scholars that China's efforts to establish the rule of law in its criminal justice system could be undermined by the overtones of a "mass movement" -- a term associated with the political persecutions of the Maoist era -- against crime.
"The leaders are not yet putting this crackdown forward as a movement," said Jiang Ping, one of China's most prominent legal scholars and former head of the Politics and Law University in Beijing, "but it has the smell of a movement because the whole party is behind it and the whole nation is involved."
Mr. Jiang, like many legal scholars, also questions whether China's heavy reliance on the death penalty has had any effect.
"The first crackdown really began in 1984, and you could say that for these 10 years or so, the more we crack down. the more serious the crime situation becomes," he said. "This time the crackdown may be connected with the need to insure stability as the economic and social shortcomings emerge" in China's reform era and create "disaffection among the masses that can lead to the spark that sets off trouble."
For now, the crackdown appears to enjoy popular support.
Even Mr. Liao's neighbors in Wuguishan village could not argue with the death penalty verdict against him. "It was fair," said a friend of the family, as he sat in Mr. Liao's courtyard home under portraits of his ancestors and the ashes of incense sticks recently burned before them. "If you kill a man, you should pay compensation with your life."

HEADLINE: New Israeli Leader's Visit Elicits Curiosity and Ambivalence

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
When Benjamin Netanyahu arrives in New York today for his first visit to the city as Prime Minister of Israel, he will be greeted by a Jewish population excessively acquainted with his American-style political sagacity but deeply ambivalent about the direction he may lead Israel.
Given the anxiety about how extreme a departure the new Prime Minister may represent, his three-day visit to the city regarded as the epicenter of Jewish life in the United States has stimulated unusually intense interest. Hundreds more people than can be accommodated have clamored for seats at his public appearances. 
 Many have seen him repeatedly before. In the 1980's, when Mr. Netanyahu was Israel's delegate to the United Nations, it was nearly impossible to navigate the television talk shows without witnessing him, and he became a familiar and popular figure in many New York Jewish circles. But the "Bibi" so omnipresent then was not the Prime Minister, and that makes all the difference.
"We know him, but we don't know him," said Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, who sees the trip as important in establishing the tone of the relationship with Jews in New York.
"We're wondering, is this the old Bibi, the new Bibi, or what Bibi?" said Phil Baum, the executive director of the American Jewish Congress. "I think American Jews are looking for some reassurance that the Likud Government is not some off-the-wall, right-wing government. I hope we get that. There is a lot of apprehension."
The two issues of foremost concern to many New York Jews are his harder-line views on the Middle East peace effort and his suggestions that his Government will significantly strengthen the authority of Orthodox Judaism in Israel.
During his crowded schedule, Mr. Netanyahu, 46, is expected to draw heavily on his reservoir of political guile and charisma to try to rally support and approval from a highly disparate population with tangled emotions that probably harbors more opponents of his ideology than supporters. In this first trip, most of the welcomers anticipate a steady dose of social felicities and palliatives from the Prime Minister and relatively little in the way of substance.
"It's Mr. Netanyahu's opportunity to make nice-nice and say all the right things about the relationship between America and Israel," said Rabbi Gerald Skolnik of the Forest Hills Jewish Center, a large Conservative synagogue. "Some will welcome him as a conquering hero, which I personally don't see him as. They will greet him as the next incarnation of the Messiah. The others, like me, who disagree with him, will greet him respectfully."
The visit, while punctuated with political courtesy calls and some talk-show appearances, will revolve around meetings with Jewish leaders and business executives.
There has been pronounced interest in hearing what he has to say. More than 600 people responded to invitations to a meeting this evening for which the host is the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Since there was room for 400, 200 were relegated to a waiting list.
"Even Congressmen are calling up for tickets and can't get in," said Malcolm Hoenlein, the executive vice chairman of the organization. "It's the first visit of a new, young Prime Minister who has a rapport with the New York community."
Another session this evening, sponsored by the Jewish Community Relations Council, with a capacity of 3,000, was fully subscribed within 48 hours. Hundreds were turned away.
"There's a lot of interest in how Netanyahu is going to square the circle on a number of issues," said Gary Rosenblatt, editor of The Jewish Week.
Rabbi Schorsch, who opposed Mr. Netanyahu, said he is somewhat less troubled on the issue of the peace effort than he was just a month ago. "I think he has played his cards very well," he said.
But he remains worried that the Prime Minister will slow the trend toward religious pluralism in Israel. "The issue that concerns American Jewry is the status of Reform and Conservative Jews," he said. "They constitute overwelmingly the majority of American Jews."
Rabbi Skolnik added: "There are a lot of people in favor of the peace process who would like to see it slowed down. I don't think most American Jews will fight him on that. But I care about the religious pluralism issue. It affects me tremendously. I'm not allowed to go to Israel and officiate over a wedding. And that does bother me a lot. In two and a half weeks, I'm taking 40 people from my synagogue to Israel on a tour. I would like to have an equal share in the Jewish state."
Mr. Netanyahu has strong support in Orthodox circles, but many in the Conservative and Reform movements feel cut out of the loop with the new Prime Minister, and regard his visit with tepid interest.
"I believe the Jewish community will give him a very warm reception, which I respect but do not participate in," said Rabbi Rolando Matalon of B'nai Jeshurun, a Conservative synagogue on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. "I do not have any warm feelings for him or his platform."
On the other hand, for people like Rabbi Avi Weiss of the Hebrew Institute of Riverdale, who is a hawk on insuring Israeli security, the election of Mr. Netanyahu has whisked them back into the mainstream. "In the past, I felt discounted, marginalized by Israeli officials," he said. "I didn't count. Now I feel I count again."
Many others, however, find him indecipherable. "He's still a mystery," said Alon Grotch, an Israeli-born psychologist in New York. "The dilemma I feel about him is you look at his whole history and his position has been consistently right wing. But his campaign was very American, based on images. That suggests a pragmatic, consummate politician who will do whatever it takes to stay in power. I saw him on 'Larry King Live' and he says a lot and he says nothing. I'm still trying to find out who he is."
The Prime Minister will arrive in the city under heavy security. He is traveling with 20 Israeli agents, double the usual allotment, and they will be augmented by Federal agents and New York police officers. A police helicopter equipped with high-resolution video cameras will track his movements within the city and sharpshooters will be poised on rooftops. Three floors are being sealed off at the hotel where he is staying, the Stanhope on Fifth Avenue and 81st Street, across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
At the Stanhope, he has meetings scheduled today with Gov. George E. Pataki, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Bob Dole, the presumed Republican nominee, and is to meet at the Sheraton New York Hotel with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Keen to draw further investment to Israel, he will have lunch at the New York Stock Exchange with 200 business leaders seeking reassurance about the Israeli economy. After the large evening sessions with Jewish leaders, he will be the guest at a private dinner held by Ronald S. Lauder, the wealthy businessman and cosmetics heir.
Tomorrow, his schedule is media-laden. He is to have breakfast with 30 journalists, meet with Jewish and Israeli journalists and conduct television and radio interviews.
On Saturday, he plans to attend morning Sabbath services at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun on East 85th Street, the modern Orthodox synagogue at which he worshiped when he lived in New York. He will walk to and from the synagogue, posing perhaps the most significant security risk during his visit. Those blocks will be cleared of vehicles and lined with police officers. Rabbi Haskel Lookstein lamented, "I'm going to have to move my car."
After the service, the Prime Minister may do some sightseeing. He is considering taking his family to the Central Park Zoo. Mr. Netanyahu will leave after sundown, the end of the Sabbath, to return to Israel.
Though many expect the Prime Minister to be asked some tough questions during his visit, few anticipate that he will get too stiff a buffeting on his first trip. "The game hasn't started," Rabbi Schorsch said. "We're just warming up."

Scanlon Leaves Firm That Handled Crises

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT 

 BODY:
John Scanlon, the longtime public relations executive who has been at the center of several corporate controversies, is leaving Abernathy MacGregor Scanlon, a financial and crisis communications agency in New York where he has been a partner since June 1993.
James L. Abernathy and James T. MacGregor, the agency's managing partners, said in a statement sent to their clients that the agency would return to a previous name, the Abernathy/MacGregor Group Inc. The statement said Mr. Scanlon, 61, would rejoin Edelman Public Relations Worldwide, where he had worked from 1983 to 1988. 
 But Michael Morley, president at Edelman in New York, said yesterday: "It's no secret we have been in discussions with John Scanlon about his return to Edelman. But no agreement has yet been reached nor will be until John has taken a well-earned break through the month of September at his home in Ireland."
Mr. Scanlon could not be reached for comment. He has been the subject of intensive news coverage for his work for a New York law firm to advise the Brown & Williamson Tobacco unit of B.A.T. Industries P.L.C. on ways to discredit Jeffrey S. Wigand, former head of research at Brown & Williamson. Mr. Wigand, who appeared on the CBS news program "60 Minutes," has accused Brown & Williamson executives of lying about whether cigarettes are addictive.

HEADLINE: U.S., Enforcing Cuba Curbs, Punishes Canadian Company

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
The Administration struck today for the first time against foreign companies operating in Cuba, informing the top executives and the biggest shareholders of a Canadian mining concern that they and their families will be barred from the United States, State Department officials said.
The action against the company, the Sherritt International Corporation, is the first application of the Helms-Burton law, which President Clinton, against the advice of many of his closest advisers, signed this year. It has raised a storm of protest throughout Europe and Latin America, and Canada has told its companies to ignore American threats and has warned it may retaliate with countersanctions. 
 [A Sherritt official in Calgary, Alberta, said the company would continue investing in Cuba. "We are staying the course," a Sherritt vice president, Patrice Merrin Best, said in an interview with Reuters. About nine officials and large shareholders are thought to be involved.]
American officials in Washington said executives from telephone companies in Mexico and Italy would be informed in coming days that they will also be barred from visiting the United States and from sending their children to visit or study here.
While today's action seemed to represent a harder line by the Administration, behind the scenes the White House is debating whether to bow to the protests abroad by suspending enforcement of another provision of the law that could cost foreign companies hundreds of millions of dollars.
President Clinton faces a deadline of Monday to decide whether to allow American companies whose properties in Cuba were seized by the Government of President Fidel Castro to file suits in United States courts against foreign companies that are now using them.
The State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said today that "there is a good deal of discussion about that issue" and that no decision had been made.
The issue is fraught with election-year risks.
Mr. Clinton signed the Republican-sponsored sanctions bill reluctantly in February after Cuban warplanes shot down two small civilian planes flown by an anti-Castro group based in Florida.
The economic isolation of Mr. Castro is an enormously charged issue within the Cuban-American community in Florida, an important state in the November presidential election, and political advisers of Mr. Clinton are urging him to take a hard line against companies doing business with Cuba.
But a hard line could also hurt Florida's economy. A coalition of Canadian church, labor and relief groups urged Canadian tourists today to boycott the state unless the United States relents on Helms-Burton. About two million Canadians travel to Florida each winter, spending about $1.3 billion.
Mr. Clinton's economic advisers, including Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and the chairman of the National Economic Council, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, have made it clear that they are worried about retaliation against American companies.
"I have some real concerns about the extraterritorial application of American law," Mr. Rubin said in a telephone interview today from Texas, where he was reviewing border controls. "But you have to balance that with our interests in bringing pressure to bear on countries like Cuba and Iran. Over the next few days we're going to have to make some decisions."
Traditionally, the United States has been opposed to proposals that punish foreign companies as a way of pressing their governments to change national policy with what is called a secondary boycott. Washington vociferously argued against similar measures in the 1970's, when Arab nations boycotted companies that did business with Israel.
But Mr. Clinton has made clear in recent weeks that he will sign legislation penalizing companies that invest in Iranian or Libyan oil projects worth more than $40 million. Differing versions of the bill have passed the House and the Senate by overwhelming margins. That bill has also been the subject of enormous opposition in Europe, especially in France and Italy.
The Helms-Burton law, named for Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, and Representative Dan Burton, Republican of Indiana, was intended to drive foreign investors out of Cuba in an attempt to bring down the Castro Government, which is already starved of cash.
It requires the Administration to bar from the United States top executives and major shareholders -- and their families -- of companies found to be "trafficking" in American property confiscated by Mr. Castro in 1959, soon after he took power.
Sherritt International operates properties that were seized from the predecessor of what is now Freeport-McMoran a New Orleans-based mining concern.
The Mexican telephone company Grupo Domos and the Italian telecommunications holding company Societa Finanziaria Telefonica per Azioni, or STET, use properties that once belonged to the ITT Corporation.
[The Mexican Government said late Wednesday that it had sent a diplomatic note to the United States Government protesting the Helms-Burton law. "The Government asked the State Department to pass on its concern to the President of the United States and urge him to suspend the entry into effect" of provisions of the law, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement quoted by Reuters].
Under the law, the officials who received the State Department letters would be banned from entering the United States starting in 45 days. Canadian officials would not release their names, but the list was said to include a number of prominent British investors in the company.
"We're bracing ourselves for a torrent of criticism from our allies," said a senior State Department official. "It's going to be very messy."
While banning individuals from the United States is the major symbolic action in the law, the big money rests in the provision that allows American citizens to sue foreigners and foreign companies that "act to manage, lease, possess, use or hold an interest in" property confiscated by Cuba from people who are now American citizens. That includes many Cuban-Americans.
Several foreign governments have said they will challenge that provision in international tribunals, including the World Trade Organization, because it gives American courts the authority to seize assets of foreign comapnies for actions that took place beyond American borders.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Read Their Lips: The Other Guy Is the Candidate in Favor of Big Tax Increases

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 10

 BODY:
Turning to what both sides said would be a central issue in the Presidential race, the Clinton and Dole campaigns today introduced television advertisements in which each portrayed the other's candidate as a steadfast proponent of big tax increases.
The attack on President Clinton had been expected, because ever since entering the race Bob Dole had described him as an adherent of high spending and high taxes. 
 But Mr. Clinton's decision to engage Mr. Dole directly on an issue that Republicans have long viewed as an Achilles' heel for the President came as a surprise, all the more so since the Clinton advertisement drew on Speaker Newt Gingrich to make the case that it was Mr. Dole who was the advocate of higher taxes.
In that commercial, which Democratic aides said was completed today and would be televised beginning on Thursday evening, the announcer intones, "Republicans called him the tax collector of the welfare state" -- Mr. Gingrich's onetime description of Mr. Dole.
In conscious imitation of a commercial that Steve Forbes used against Mr. Dole in the Republican Presidential primary in New Hampshire -- much to Mr. Dole's annoyance, according to his aides -- this one offers viewers a scroll of various tax increases that Mr. Dole supported during his three and a half decades in Congress.
It ends by showing him proclaiming at a campaign stop, "You're going to see the real Bob Dole from now on," while the tag line reads: "The real Bob Dole. 35 years of higher taxes."
For its part, the Dole campaign went on the air this evening with a commercial that tried to make much the same case about the President. In a segment shot in black and white, this advertisement showed Mr. Clinton saying in a campaign debate in October 1992, "Now, I'll tell you this: I will not raise taxes on the middle class to pay for these programs."
It went on to say that upon becoming President, Mr. Clinton had embarked on a program that "gave us the largest tax increase in history."
"Higher income taxes," it said, including "increased taxes on Social Security benefits. More payroll taxes."
"Under Clinton, the typical American family now pays over $1,500 more in Federal taxes," it said. "A big price to pay for his broken promise."
Clinton campaign aides immediately attacked the premise of the Dole advertisement, noting that almost all the tax increase at issue had fallen on the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers rather than on the middle class.
Accordingly Mr. Clinton's aides, and independent tax experts as well, disputed the advertisement's assertion that "the typical American family now pays over $1,500 more in Federal taxes." They argued that in fact the only provision of the Clinton tax increase that had really affected middle-class families was a 4.3-cent-a-gallon rise in the Federal tax on gasoline, amounting to about $36 a year for each such family.
What is more, the tax increase that the President championed -- totaling about $250 billion over five years, part of a 1993 deficit-reduction effort -- is, adjusted for inflation, less than the tax increase enacted under President Ronald Reagan in 1982.
Whatever the differences over the numbers, today's squabbling, and the advertisements themselves, were a vivid illustration that the matter of tax increases would occupy a prominent place on the Presidential election landscape this year, and that the White House was not prepared to concede an issue that has proved regularly effective for Republican Presidential candidates for a generation.
After learning of the Clinton advertisement, Mike Murphy, a Dole strategist, said this evening, "This is a huge strategic victory for us."
Mr. Murphy maintained that the Republicans had succeeded in shifting the campaign debate from Mr. Dole's equivocal remarks on the addictiveness of tobacco "to a fight on taxes."
"We're spending our money making this election about our issue of taxes," he said, "and the Democrats are making it about our issue of taxes."
Mr. Clinton's aides saw it differently. The Republicans, one political adviser to the President said, believe that if they win the debate on taxes, they will have won "the whole ball game." But "we're not going to cede it," this adviser said. "No way."
Consequently the Clinton commercial listed Mr. Dole's support of measures like the income tax increase enacted in 1990, during the Bush Administration, and the 1983 increase in the Social Security payroll tax, during the Reagan Administration.
But the President's aides declined this evening to offer any examples of tax votes cast by Mr. Dole with which Mr. Clinton now disagreed.
"The purpose of this ad is to expose the hypocrisy of Bob Dole and the Republicans' talking about the President," said Joe Lockhart, Mr. Clinton's campaign spokesman. "And that's what the ad is about. We're not talking about any particular tax increase. The ad is designed to expose his hypocrisy when he's talking about Bill Clinton and taxes."
Both commercials will be televised on CNN and in local markets within states that are expected to be closely contested this fall. The Democratic National Committee learned of the Republican commercial this week as Mr. Dole's aides began distributing it to local television stations. A copy made its way to Democratic operatives in Washington, who immediately began finishing a response advertisement on the subject that had been waiting on a shelf.

Clinton Uses Sanctions Against Canadians
The Clinton Administration took specific action for the first time against foreign companies operating in Cuba, informing top executives and shareholders of the Sherritt International Corporation, a large Canadian mining concern, that they and their families would be barred from entering the United States, State Department officials said.
This is the first application of the Helms-Burton amendment, which President Clinton signed despite the warnings of close advisers. The provision has fired protests throughout Europe and Latin America. Canada told companies to ignore the threats. [Page A1.]
 
Hewlett-Packard Sees Slow Demand
In news that could roil technology stocks again today, Hewlett-Packard said that new orders for all of its products were slowing and would probably hurt the company's profitability for the current quarter.

THE CAMPAIGNS AND THE ISSUES

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

 BODY:

The Republican Primaries
A Bonus Proposal For Late Contests
The Presidential primary and caucus season has steadily been growing shorter as, over the years, more and more states have tried to schedule their primaries earlier and earlier in an attempt to gain greater political leverage in the nominating process. 
 This year, the season was the most frenetic ever, with so many states voting one-after-another in the first six weeks or so that voters often complained they were being forced to make a decision without proper time to contemplate.
On the Republican side -- there was, of course, no contest on the Democratic side -- it was clear well before half of the primaries and caucuses had been held that Bob Dole would almost certainly be the nominee. Voters in the remaining states felt politically left out and primary and caucus turnout plummeted.
Things may be different, come the next primary and caucus season, in the year 2000.
A study task force set up by the Republican National Committee is recommending that the party offer bonus national convention delegates to states that schedule their primaries and caucuses late in the season.
The task force suggests that the season run from the first Monday in February through the third Tuesday in June, with states that schedule voting after March 15 qualifying for delegate bonuses -- ever larger for ever later dates.
For example, states voting between March 15 and April 14 would receive a 10 percent increase in delegates. Those voting between April 15 and May 14 would receive a 15 percent increase. And those voting on or after May 15 would receive a 20 percent bonus.
What's the outlook for the proposal, which will be put to a vote in August at the 1996 Republican National Convention in San Diego?
A big, politically powerful state like California, which moved its primary date forward this year, might be enticed to move back in 2000 in return for even more convention clout.
But a small state like New Hampshire would gain relatively little convention clout with a bonus, however big, and, anyway, probably would prefer to keep its nationally prominent position as one of the earliest states to vote.
Before the task force proposal can be put to a floor vote in San Diego, it must first make its way through a committee process, much as a piece of Congressional legislation. At that level, every state, big or small, gets two votes.
 
Campaigning in Cyberspace
Vermont Candidate Petitions Web Users
Politicians long ago discovered the World Wide Web, establishing sites where interested cybersurfers could retrieve information about candidates and causes. Just yesterday, Vice President Al Gore announced that a "Clinton/Gore '96" site was up and running.
But perhaps the most unusual political cybersite seen thus far in 1996 is the one established by August St. John, a Vermonter who, when he's not dabbling in politics, commutes down to New York to teach marketing on the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University.
Professor St. John is running for Governor of the Green Mountain State, as an independent and a self-described "futurist." But in order to get on the November ballot, he must submit nominating petitions signed by at least 1,000 qualified Vermont voters, no easy task for a candidate who says he has little money and hardly any staff.
His solution?
A web site -- what else for a confirmed futurist? -- from which voters can download a copy of his petition, then print it out, sign it and send it in.
"I'm trying to prove you can run for office if you have a lot of interest but not a lot of money," the Professor says.
No count yet on how many signatures he has pulled in with his offbeat on-line approach, which state election officials only recently approved. But even if he gets on the ballot, as a relatively unknown candidate he still will face a steep uphill political struggle, especially against the incumbent Governor, Howard Dean, a well-regarded Democrat who is seeking a third two-year term.
Republicans, who will choose a candidate in a September primary, recently lost their strongest hope when Lieut. Gov. Barbara Snelling suffered a stroke and announced she would not seek nomination. With her out of the race, political experts now give the edge in the primary to John Gropper, a computer consultant from Rochester who unsuccessfully sought the nomination in 1994.
 
The Nader Strategy
Stealth Candidate Poses a Threat
He's hardly campaigning, a stealth candidate if ever there was one, but Ralph Nader is already on the Presidential ballot as the Green Party candidate in half a dozen states -- Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, New Mexico and Oregon.
What's more, efforts are under way to get the noted consumer crusader listed in six more states, all of major political importance -- Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and, as of Tuesday, New York.
"People are tired of voting for the lesser of two evils," Mark Dunlea, the head of New York's Greens, said in kicking off the campaign to get the 15,000 petition signatures needed to get the Nader name on the Empire State's ballot.
Nobody expects Mr. Nader to be elected President, not even Mr. Nader. But his candidacy carries a certain credible threat. Because of his long presence on the national scene, he has a constituency and, polls indicate, he has the potential to pull votes away from President Clinton.
In a closely fought fall contest in big states like New York or California, this could pose danger to the President. To counter the threat, Mr. Clinton might be forced to trim his political sails on reform of economic policy, election law and environmental protection, all Nader crusades. B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: CONSTITUENCIES;
After Dole's Snub, N.A.A.C.P. Greets Clinton Warmly

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 10

 BODY:
President Clinton and the N.A.A.C.P. warmly embraced each other today as Mr. Clinton, in an address to the organization's annual meeting, touted his Administration's economic record in creating jobs, condemned a wave of arson against black Southern churches and vowed to veto Republican efforts to roll back gun control legislation.
"I will say one thing that the Republican candidate for President did not say, and probably will not and cannot say," Mr. Clinton told the delegates. "I will veto any attempt to repeal the assault weapons ban." 
 Mr. Clinton's likely Republican rival, Bob Dole, backed away on Tuesday from efforts to repeal the ban on 19 kinds of assault weapons. Today, Mr. Clinton appeared to be challenging Mr. Dole to match his veto promise.
On these and other points, the President enjoyed a vigorous, positive reception. Though the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is ostensibly nonpartisan, the 3,000 delegates meeting here greeted Mr. Clinton with a standing ovation and repeated chants of "four more years!"
In part, of course, that is because most of them are liberal Democrats. But the enthusiasm for the President might also reflect the group's anger over the decision on Tuesday by his likely Republican rival, Bob Dole, turning down an invitation to speak to the group. As a result, Mr. Clinton's mere presence carried as much weight as his words, perhaps even more.
"Had Dole come I don't think the reaction to the President would have been as partisan as it was," said Julian Bond, a member of the group's board of directors.
Jonas Byrnes, a delegate from Kansas City, Mo., said he believed Mr. Dole had made a mistake in bypassing the meeting. "If he expects to get the black vote, he should at least have shown the courtesy of showing up to discuss the issues," Mr. Byrnes said. "Just don't write people off."
Not everyone was impressed with the President, however. Braimeh Kanu, president of the N.A.A.C.P.'s Springfield, Ill., chapter, asserted that many of the new jobs the President said had been created lacked "permanency," and chided Mr. Clinton for not being more specific on how he would further black economic development in a second term.
"A lot of us clap but don't chew on the meat of what he is really saying," Mr. Kanu said.
For his part, Mr. Clinton was as relaxed as if he were "in the home of a old friend," as Sallie Lee, a delegate from Jamaica, Queens, put it. He called N.A.A.C.P. officials by their first names, joked that Benjamin L. Hooks, 71, a former executive director, was looking "younger and handsomer than ever," and called the group's organist, J.R. Williams, "Brother Williams."
On the subject of church burnings, Mr. Clinton touted the Justice Department's indictment of two white supremacists on charges of burning down a church in Alabama. But the President's tone was preacherly and professorial, comparing the burnings with the ethnic violence in Rwanda or Bosnia and the sectarian strife in Ulster.
"There are people all over the world who look like they can't exist unless they go out and kill somebody who is different from them; or at least keep them at arms length," Mr. Clinton said.
The mood -- indeed the prospects -- of the N.A.A.C.P. are far brighter than they were just two years ago.
During the past 12 months, the organization has whittled its debt to about $800,000 from $3.2 million, said Francisco Borges, the group's treasurer. Mr. Borges said that the bulk of the debt was reduced by negotiating payment plans -- in some cases paying less than the full amount -- with vendors like hotel chains who had not been paid for rooms and services associated with the N.A.A.C.P.'s 1993 convention in Chicago.
By reducing obligations to vendors, laying off staff and closing several regional offices, the group has cut its spending to about $11.4 million last year from $18.6 million in 1994, according to a report submitted to its budget committee.
"We are current now, relative to our obligations," Mr. Borges said in an interview.
But the report also indicates how much the discord that has wracked the civil rights group in recent years has hampered its ability to raise money. Revenues plummeted to $13.7 million in 1995, down from about $15 million the year before. In the first five months of this year, the group has raised $6.4 million, indicating that contributions and dues have rebounded.
Under the leadership of its new president and chief executive officer, Kweisi Mfume, the N.A.A.C.P. has also begun to streamline and modernize its operations.
For example, the group has moved to computerize its membership rolls under a contract with the Saturn Corporation, a software company that has upgraded the membership and direct mail capabilities of major environmental, religious and relief organizations.
The system will allow the N.A.A.C.P. to track the names and addresses of more than 1.2 million current and former members. The new system also will give the group the capability to contact members in any given Congressional district so they can put pressure on members of Congress when it is needed.

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
On Palisades, 2- and 3-Family Homes

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: NORTH BERGEN, N.J.

 BODY:
Here on a ridge carved from the Palisades and overlooking the Hudson River, an enclave of two- and three-family homes is beginning to rise.
Bergen Ridge will consist of 34 houses, ranging from 3,000 to 3,800 square feet, for a total of 90 residences. The development signals a return to a housing form that has long characterized this Hudson County township. The houses will be grouped in clusters along a central slice of the six-acre site, off Bulls Ferry Road, not far from Boulevard East, where the cliff rises behind it 80 feet. The property sits 100 feet above River Road, which runs parallel to the Hudson's west shore. 
 Each of the 12 two-family houses will have a 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom residence for the owner on the first and second levels, topped with a two-bedroom, 1,000-square-foot rental apartment. The 22 three-family homes will be similar the two-family houses, but they will also have a one-bedroom, 800-square-foot ground-level rental, cut into the cliff. Each apartment will also have its own private front entrance. All the homes will have a one-car garage as well a two-car driveway and two street-level parking spaces.
The $8 million project, being developed by the Applied Companies of Hoboken, underscores an increase in building activity in this 5.3-square-mile community after a four-year lull. It is also another indicator of the renewed interest of developers in housing in riverfront towns in Hudson and Bergen Counties, where a spate of new and revived projects have just been completed, are planned or already under way.
The Bergen Ridge project is a revival. It was conceived during the building boom of the last decade as a 120-unit, five-story condominium building. But the local developers were able only to blast clear the ridge before the project faltered. The Bank of New York, which took back the property through foreclosure late in 1994, sold it a year and a half ago to the new developer for just under $1 million.
Applied -- which is involved in three other riverfront projects with 2,000 rental and condominium apartments -- redesigned Bergen Ridge for several reasons. Low-rise buildings are easier and less costly to build, "making the construction economics more cost-effective," said Michael I. Barry, a company vice president.
The market also has a supply of condominiums and more are planned. "Two- and three-family homes fit in North Bergen and can be easily absorbed," he said.
Henry Gomez and his wife, Susan Rogler Gomez, would like to buy a house and move with their 2-year-old son from their rental apartment in the township. "A two-family appeals to us because of the security of the rental income," said Mr. Gomez, a public relations director at Home Box Office in Manhattan. Mrs. Gomez is a vice president at the Union Chelsea National Bank in Manhattan. "Based on the size," Mr. Gomez said, "we feel it's an excellent value."
A two-family house, he added, will "hold its value better than a condo and stands a good chance" of appreciating over time.
North Bergen welcomes the construction. Over the last four years the township has lost $100 million in revenues from properties with the departure of industries and tax appeals, said Joseph Auriemma, North Bergen's business administrator.
Besides Applied's move into Bergen Ridge, another developer has taken over the unbuilt portion of a project on one of the last buildable tracts along North Bergen's half-mile-long waterfront. The Barrett Companies of Ridgewood plans to turn the 14-acre site into twin 12-story buildings with a total of 500 apartments. Thomas J. Barrett, the company's president, said the first building would be marketed as a rental and the second as a condominium.
"This activity is the beginning of a resurgence for us," Mr. Auriemma said. "It is the type of development that will be a benefit to the township and a real opportunity to put ratables back on the tax rolls."
At Bergen Ridge, the brick-and-vinyl clapboard homes will be centered in the middle in four clusters, each with six to 16 units that follow the natural contours of the site.
The project will be reached from a road that will snake behind the homes. "The idea was to optimize the river views," said Erica Tishman of Peter DeWitt Architects of Manhattan, which did the site planning and building design for the project.
To fit all 34 houses on the site they will be attached, rather than separated by side yards. But buyers own the land beneath the house, and a 25-by-25-foot backyard. The project will also include an outdoor pool. Owners will pay a $100 yearly fee for the upkeep of the pool and common areas.
Prices are expected to start at $285,000 for the two-family houses, and at $345,000 for the three-family homes. The monthly rentals will be $800 to $1,000 for a one-bedroom apartment and $1,200 to $1,400 for a two-bedroom. Mr. Barry said mortgages at competitive rates with 5 to 10 percent down would be offered to buyers through two mortgage companies. Sales are to begin the week after Labor Day, he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Hurt by Stock Slump And Rate-Rise Hints in Europe

BYLINE: Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended mostly lower against leading currencies yesterday, weakened by a stock market slump and fresh signals that European nations might be ready to raise interest rates.
Investors also appear to have tired of waiting for the dollar to rally against European currencies, which have held firm as the dollar has risen against the Japanese yen. 
 In New York, the dollar settled at 110.35 yen, up from 110.30 on Wednesday. The dollar fell to 1.5216 marks from 1.5250. The British pound rose to $1.5533 from $1.5525.
"Some of the dollar selloff was born out of frustration." said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. "It's a combination of people worrying about stocks and also thinking maybe it's time to adjust stale long positions."
The dollar kept to narrow trading ranges in overseas markets, restrained by heavy purchases of option contracts betting on a continuing lack of price volatility.
But as the stock market began to sink in early New York trading, dropping the Dow Jones industrials as much as 133 points during the session, the dollar fell in sympathy.
"We saw modest selling pressure, mostly from speculators," said Marc Chandler, senior foreign exchange analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "But today's move was exaggerated by thin market conditions and a few chunky orders."
The dollar tested technical support at 110 yen and 1.52 German marks, but ultimately found buyers at those levels.
Investors began to speculate that European interest rates might soon rise after the Bundesbank declined to cut German interest rates at its regular meeting.
There was also speculation that Belgium and the Netherlands were considering raising rates, which would make dollar-linked assets less appealing.
"That is perceived as negative for the dollar if it signals an end to the cycle of lower interest rates in Europe," Mr. Chandler said.
Talk that the Federal Reserve may delay an expected increase in United States short-term interest rates also weighed on the dollar.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that a new Federal Reserve study discussed a theory that when inflation was relatively low, policy makers should refrain from taking action.
"People would not appreciate the Fed taking such a laissez-faire approach," Mr. Pettit of the Long-Term Credit Bank said.

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
A Soft Landing?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
To most Americans it is an obscure corner of the world, not on the radar screen of concerns. But the Korean Peninsula in fact presents one of the most dangerous and difficult challenges to U.S. policy today.
The danger is of an unusual kind. It comes from the economic decline of a country whose totalitarian regime we detest, North Korea. We might take satisfaction in the troubles of an odious system, but neither American nor South Korean officials are indulging in such Schadenfreude. For the decline could lead to menacing instability, even military aggression. 
 For six years now, since it lost its subsidies from the Soviet Union and China, North Korea has had negative economic growth. Floods last year made an already bad food problem critical; recent escapees have reported incidents of starvation. A shortage of oil has cut the generation of electric power.
The fear in Seoul and Washington is that the Kim Jong Il regime could provoke a military conflict with South Korea as a distraction from its failure. Or, in another scenario, a collapse of the system could put an enormous economic and humanitarian burden on the South.
South Koreans used to see reunification of the peninsula under their system as a goal devoutly to be desired. Now they are not so unthinkingly enthusiastic. They know what absorption of an economically backward East Germany cost the German economy, and North Korea is a far worse case.
The South's economy grows as much every nine months as the total of North Korea's annual gross domestic product. Since the Korean War, per capita income here has grown from less than $100 a year to $10,000. It is the disparity in the two Koreas -- success and openness against failure and obsessive isolation -- that creates danger. No one can be sure what the Pyongyang regime may do under the pressure of failure.
The Clinton Administration's answer to the danger is a policy of "engagement" with North Korea. Two years ago it negotiated an agreement for Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear program in return for provision of non-menacing nuclear reactors and an interim supply of fuel oil. We have on the table, unanswered by Pyongyang, a proposal for four-party talks with the two Koreas and China on a Korean peace treaty.
Just now the U.S. promised $6.8 million in emergency food aid. But both Seoul and Washington have said that any more substantial assistance will be conditioned on North Korean willingness to talk about the four-party treaty proposal.
The aim of the engagement policy is to bring about change in North Korea with a "soft landing." The U.S. Ambassador to Seoul, James T. Laney, explained in an interview that the idea is to have North Korea open itself increasingly to foreign investment, make economic reforms and in return receive enough help to get through the immediate crisis.
"Military deterrents worked when the North Koreans had something to lose," the Ambassador said, meaning a functioning economy. "Now the problem is their descent into possible instability, with the chance of desperation or accident.
"The North is wobbly. If it wobbled onto the South, the consequences would be catastrophic.
"We have to find new ways of risk management. We don't do it out of any romantic notion that they've changed heart or that they deserve our assistance. They don't. It's a self-interested policy to reduce the risks of irrationality."
The thesis is that drawing North Korea gradually into the world, and the world into its economy, would give the regime a stake in more reasonable behavior. But can it be trusted to keep agreements?
"It's not as if we had no experience with their keeping an agreement," Ambassador Laney said. "We do, an important agreement," the nuclear freeze. American experts are now in North Korea encasing 8,000 spent fuel rods so they cannot be reprocessed into plutonium for bombs. And South Korean technicians are in the North surveying a site for a power reactor that Pyongyang at first refused to let the South supply.
"Their isolation is unsustainable," Mr. Laney said. "They have no choice."
But the question is whether Kim Jong Il and his colleagues will believe that their regime can survive "engagement," however rational it seems to us. Some here think they will not risk letting the world into North Korea.

HEADLINE: Democrats Drafting a Platform With a Corner for Dissent

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 11

 BODY:
Ostentatiously unified, a group of Democratic Party officials today finished the first stage of drafting a party platform that reflects President Clinton's policies across a range of issues but tries to remain broad enough so that Democrats who disagree with the President on particular points will not be antagonized.
Not one voice of dissent was raised in the two days that the party's Platform Drafting Committee met here. 
 The most vigorous advocates of abortion rights embraced new platform language worked out by the White House that states that the party, while unequivocally supporting legal, Government-financed abortions, respects "the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue."
Advocates of gay rights did not complain that the rough draft under discussion today completely avoided the questions of same-sex marriages and homosexuals in the military.
Labor leaders accepted a section favoring trade expansion and extolling the President's push for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the unions had strenuously opposed.
No one blinked an eye over the statement in the draft that "the era of big Government is over" -- a direct quotation from the President's State of the Union Message this year, but an observation that would have been unimaginable in a Democratic platform as recently as eight years ago.
The drill-team precision is quite a change for a party used to sit-ins, walk-outs and even riots over platform issues like civil rights and the Vietnam War.
This new-found unity comes on the 100th anniversary this week of the adoption of a party platform that laid the foundation for the Democratic Party of the 20th century, creating enthusiastic supporters on the one hand but driving legions of defectors into the laps of Republicans.
The party's convention in July 1896 in Chicago was where William Jennings Bryan gave his famous "Cross of Gold" speech, insisting on putting more money into circulation by the free coinage of silver. It was there that the party first adopted a platform advocating a graduated income tax. And it was there that the platform placed the party squarely on the side of labor unions and against big business.
But this year the Democrats are determined to stand peacefully on the sidelines and watch Republican platform battles over such issues as abortion and environmental protection.
"The tables are reversed this year," said Donald L. Fowler, the Democratic national chairman. "We're enjoying unity. They're miserable in their division. We're enjoying that a great deal."
The rough draft of the platform that was discussed by the drafting committee here this week will be modified and then voted on by the full Platform Committee at a meeting in Pittsburgh on Aug. 5. A final draft will go before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 27, the second night.
Unlike the situation in some parliamentary democracies, party platforms in the United States are hardly binding and, in fact, are often forgotten between one election year and the next. But they do help define the parties.
However the final wording turns out, the Democratic platform this year will undoubtedly favor legal abortion, support gun control, oppose discrimination against homosexuals and emphasize environmental protection.
The Republican platform, which is to be written in San Diego the first week in August, will surely advocate outlawing abortions, oppose gun control, oppose statutory civil rights for homosexuals and stress economic development over the environment.
Democrats are overwhelmingly in favor of free choice on abortion. But to avoid any rift over the matter like the one that has dominated Republican platform discussions, the White House produced a paragraph that seems destined to get into the final platform untouched. It states: "The Democratic Party is a party of inclusion. We respect the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue, and we welcome all our members to participate at every level."
This comes right after the paragraph stressing the party's support for legal access to abortion regardless of a woman's ability to pay for it. And it comes just before a paragraph supporting contraceptive research and family planning.
Mr. Fowler interpreted the meaning this way: "We are a committed pro-choice party. That implies that people can choose for themselves in accordance with their own conscience."
The Democrats' platform this year has the same themes as the one in 1992, but several passages have been changed to conform with the politics of the last four years.
For instance, the 1992 platform supported equality for homosexuals in the military; the issue is not mentioned this year. The 1992 platform proclaimed the "right" of all Americans to "quality, affordable health care." The rough draft this year calls only for assuring that Americans have access to health insurance.
"This reflects reality today," Mr. Fowler said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Stock Decline Helps Bonds Rise 3d Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities gained for a third consecutive session yesterday as investors focused on inflation data due today and a swirl of opinions about Federal Reserve monetary policy.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 10/32 , to 87. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to yield 7.05 percent, from 7.08 percent on Wednesday. 
 Traders said investors took profits in early trading yesterday after the previous day's rally, pulling prices lower. But bonds recovered as stocks tumbled, prompting a flow of money out of stocks and into the short end of the Treasury market.
"Much of the flight to quality went into the bill market, which is the shortest and fastest and most liquid place to park assets while you're waiting for the next shoe to drop," said Jack Regan, chief market strategist at Josephthal, Lyon & Ross.
Short-covering by investors who had bet that Treasury prices would fall also bolstered the market, he said, as did buying of longer maturities by hedge funds.
"But initially it was the money from the selling of stocks going into the bill market that propelled Treasury prices," Mr. Regan said.
Bill and note prices rose, with the rate on the six-month bill falling to 5.28 percent, from 5.31 percent on Wednesday, and the rate on the two-year note falling to 6.25 percent from 6.28 percent.
The market continued to be buffetted by speculation about the Federal Reserve's next step on interest rates. An article in The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday suggested to some investors that the Fed would hold steady on rates. It said a Fed paper took a new approach to monetary policy, arguing that when inflation is relatively low, as is the case now, policy makers should refrain from taking action.
An article in The Washington Post yesterday also reported on the paper and while both articles said that the study did not represent current Fed policy, the market did not see it that way until yesterday.
Other speculation about the Fed weighed on the market. A report by Johnson Smick, a Washington consulting firm led by former Fed officials, suggested that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, would have raised rates if he had had the jobs report in hand at the meeting of Fed policy makers last week, said Kim Rupert, an economist with MMS International of San Francisco. The report said that Mr. Greenspan "gambled" by holding rates steady.
"That's what I believe took the market down early today," Ms. Rupert said. "Because the report was released late Wednesday night, the market did not get around to reacting to it until this morning."
At a time when investors are so uncertain about the direction of interest rates, such reports and speculation can have a greater effect on prices than at other times.
The market will turn its attention today to the latest inflation numbers. "We believe the Producer Price Index and retail sales for June will be market friendly," Mr. Regan of Josephthal, Lyon & Ross said. He expects an increase in the price index of one-tenth of 1 percent.
Today's retail data have "the potential to surprise on the strong side," Ms. Rupert of MMS International said, "especially considering recent strength in building materials and furniture sales."
But she said that the most recent weakness in the Johnson Redbook data and a slowdown in auto sales suggested that the retail reports would be soft.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Up 18,000 in Week

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits jumped by 18,000 last week, the Labor Department said today. The size of the increase surprised economists, who had been looking for a more modest gain of around 3,000.
New applications for jobless benefits totaled 369,000 for the week ending last Saturday. In the previous week, claims fell by 3,000. 
 The increase last week came after three weeks of improvement. The four-week moving average for claims also rose to 357,750, its highest level since April. It had been 355,500 the previous week.
Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the one-week change as the June unemployment rate hit a six-year low of 5.3 percent.

HEADLINE: Schoenberg Archives to Leave U.S.C.

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
The University of Southern California has agreed to give up its vast collection of musical scores, papers, drawings, writings and tapes of the composer Arnold Schoenberg and to pay half the cost of transferring the collection elsewhere, ending a bitter dispute with the Schoenberg heirs.
Spokesmen for both sides confirmed yesterday that the university, in Los Angeles, would turn over the archives, worth some $50 million, by the end of 1998. 
 While the family has not decided who will get the collection, several European institutions have made offers to the Schoenbergs, who are also talking to the New School for Social Research in Manhattan.
The family contends that the university repeatedly violated pledges it made 23 years ago to help preserve the legacy of Schoenberg, an inventor of 12-tone music and one of the most influential composers of the 20th century, who died in 1951 at 76. The archives contain 6,000 pages of Schoenberg's music, drawings, and writings; some 2,000 published volumes of music, and books, diaries, letters, and even a piano and his desk in a replica of his study.
In lawsuits and countersuits that cost the two sides hundreds of thousands of dollars, the heirs accused U.S.C. of violating its 1973 agreement not to use the institute building for purposes unrelated to Schoenberg's music. The family demanded that U.S.C. relinquish the materials and pay to have everything transferred to another site, including items given by other donors after the institute opened in 1977.
The university denied the family's charges and challenged many of the rights the family had claimed under the 1973 agreement. After a state court judge barred U.S.C. in January from using the institute for activities unrelated to Schoenberg, negotiations began toward yesterday's agreement.
The battle has drawn much of its heat from bitter animosity among key figures, as well as from differing assessments of Schoenberg's place in the ranks of great composers. The dispute also highlights the frequently sensitive issue of how much control donors should have over their gifts to institutions, and for how long.
Finally, it reflects the perils of shifting tastes. U.S.C. paid a high price to acquire the collection, only to find that over time, public interest in Schoenberg and his work had waned. "Schoenberg is simply not Beethoven," said a music scholar at U.S.C. who insisted on anonymity.
E. Randol Schoenberg, the composer's grandson, who represented the estate, said that "enticing" offers for the archives had come from the Hague, Vienna and Berlin, but that the Mannes College of Music, of the New School for Social Research, was also being considered as a new home for the archives, a possibility confirmed by Mannes. Officials at several other institutions said they had ruled out a bid for the collection, citing the Schoenbergs' stringent conditions, which, in one case, included a request that the institution pay up to $500,000 in legal fees incurred by the family in its battle.
Schoenberg scholars are dismayed at the prospect of losing the archives to Europe, which the Jewish composer, born in Austria, fled after the Nazis came to power.
"Because Schoenberg was also a teacher, painter, writer and theorist of music, the archives are a true slice of 20th century culture," said Walter Frisch, a music professor at Columbia University.
Claudio Spies, professor emeritus of music at Princeton, said it was "revolting" that the Schoenberg family, "three imbeciles who know nothing about music," would even consider transferring the collection to Berlin or Vienna, where Jews were so viciously persecuted. But Ronald R. Schoenberg, the composer's eldest son, said that the archives must go where they would receive the greatest respect.
U.S.C. officials said that however enthusiastic they were about the archives, keeping them under the conditions outlined in the 1973 agreement no longer made economic sense, given "shrinking funds for higher education," said Lloyd Armstrong Jr., U.S.C.'s provost since 1993. "We asked the family in the spring of 1995 for changes that would make the institute more cost-effective from an academic standpoint, but they refused."
To win the collection in 1973, U.S.C. pledged to found a Schoenberg Institute of Music to house the archives, and construct and staff a building. The institute, U.S.C. further agreed, would be used solely for concerts, lectures, research and events related to the music of Schoenberg, who lived for 17 years in Los Angeles before his death.
Under its first director, Leonard Stein, who had been a student of Schoenberg's, the institute held numerous conferences and recitals, and published a scholarly journal. When Mr. Stein retired in 1991, U.S.C., with strong prodding from the Schoenberg family, hired Paul Zukofsky, a highly regarded violinist and former director of chamber music at Juilliard.
But Mr. Zukofsky and the Schoenbergs soon clashed when, several people familiar with the dispute said, the new director began quarreling with the staff, shut down the institute's lectures and concerts and encouraged the disbanding of the Friends of the Arnold Schoenberg Institute, a 200-member group that raised money for the institute.
Mr. Zukofsky said in an interview that he had done all of these things at the family's urging. Whatever the case, the Schoenbergs accused Mr. Zukofsky of trying to eliminate their role in the institute. In a 1994 memo to a U.S.C. administrator, Mr. Zukofsky wrote, "I stipulate that I am intensely irritated by the Schoenbergs." While the institute's $350,000 annual budget -- less than one-twenty-fifth of one percent of U.S.C.'s annual budget -- was "perhaps too small to matter," he wrote, "I really have to ask why we are putting up with this."
U.S.C. seemed to agree. In a letter to the university's board in 1995, Mr. Armstrong, the provost, complained that the institute's recital hall was seldom used and not much visited by scholars. "We can't spend more than $300K per year," he wrote, "on an activity that has marginal positive impact on the university or the community beyond."
The lawsuit has cost U.S.C. hundreds of thousands of dollars; the university refuses to say how much. "If they had spent that money on the institute," said Judith Rosen, the founder of the now defunct friends' group, "there would be no problem." Meanwhile, U.S.C. announced in June that it had reached the halfway mark of a $1 billion endowment drive.
Several scholars said the rupture between U.S.C. and the family was caused partly by a clash of "visions" between the heirs and Mr. Zukofsky.
Ms. Rosen, who had supported Mr. Zukofsky on the U.S.C. search committee, said that once he got the job, he "antagonized everyone." "He totally misread the city," she said.
Ms. Rosen said she also blamed U.S.C. for the impending loss of the archives. "If Schoenberg had written music for a football marching band, we would have been a lot more successful," she said.
Mr. Zukofsky and U.S.C. officials said that the university had lavished attention on the institute, spending more than $5 million in the last 22 years on building and expanding its operations. Instead of mounting poorly attended concerts and lectures, he said, he had concentrated on "getting material in the archives published" and on creating an inventory of Schoenberg's letters, of great use to scholars.
Most parties agree that, in retrospect, the university was probably ill advised to have made the commitments it did in its 1973 contract. The clash, they note, coincided with a public decline in Schoenberg's music and growing attention to more popular culture.
"Maybe that is really what shocked the Schoenbergs," said Mr. Frisch of Columbia, "that the reverence for high musical tradition was no longer shared by everyone, particularly those who control money at universities."

HEADLINE: A Market Ripe for Manipulation;
Laxity in London Opened Door for a Sumitomo Trader

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
Anyone who has taken Economics 101 knows that the price of goods and services is determined by supply and demand.
But not in the copper market. Not until recently, at least. 
 The headlines last month trumpeting the dismissal by the Sumitomo Corporation of a copper trader who had racked up at least $1.8 billion in losses underscored what metals traders have known for years: The copper market, largely centered here in the frenetic "rings" of the London Metal Exchange, is more a gentlemen's club than a trading pit.
Loosely regulated and opaquely run, the exchange apparently gave the trader, Yasuo Hama naka, the cover he needed to masterfully manipulate the laws of supply and demand for perhaps as long as a decade, according to a number of traders and others familiar with the way the market operates.
Armed with Sumitomo's billions and what must have been a cast-iron stomach, Mr. Hama naka took huge positions, through the exchange and on the even less regulated over-the-counter market, in both physical copper and contracts for its future delivery. Capitalizing on weak disclosure rules, he was able to mask when and how much he was buying and selling on behalf of Sumitomo, the world's biggest supplier of processed copper. That let him confuse other traders about the true size of his holdings and thus the real level of global demand.
Indeed, Mr. Hamanaka seems to have come as close as any trader ever has to controlling a global market for an extended period of time, earning the moniker "Mr. Copper" for his ability to affect prices. Usually, he would use that power to push prices up. If a wave of selling put downward pressure on his position, he appeared to have an almost limitless ability to keep buying and thus prop up the price.
For years, those maneuvers presumably filled the coffers of his employer in two ways. One was through sales, by another arm of the company, of processed copper at the premium price. The other was from big bets that Mr. Hamanaka placed in the futures market -- bets that the price would indeed rise.
"No one is bigger than the market, but Hamanaka was bigger than the market at times and he used that to keep prices high," said one longtime London Metal Exchange trader who spoke on condition of anonymity.
But the laws of supply and demand can be manipulated for only so long, even in the murky world of copper. Regulators here eventually got on the case, prodded by their American counterparts as well as by recent scandals involving other "rogue" traders. And convinced that Mr. Hamanaka had manipulated the market into an artificially high zone, hedge funds and other short-sellers ganged up on him, throwing huge sums of their own into a game of chicken to force the price down.
"At some point this spring, it was obvious that the battle was unwinnable" by Mr. Hamanaka, one trader at a major American investment bank said. "You could detect a sense of desperation in his trades, a wildness that indicated things weren't working out quite like he had calculated."
When Mr. Hamanaka lost the game in mid-May, and copper prices started to collapse, the effect was devastating to both him and his company. His whereabouts undisclosed, Mr. Hamanaka has issued no public statements. Sumitomo, which insists that Mr. Hamanaka's trades were unauthorized and that his losses were just as much a surprise to management as they were to the public, may be out as much as $4 billion when all the dust clears, some traders said.
Whether Sumitomo came out a net winner or loser during the Hamanaka years is not known, however, since he is thought to have made plenty of money for the company before the collapse.
But everyone else has had to foot the bill, at least in a small way. Mr. Hamanaka artificially raised the price of copper an average of 5 cents a pound on the spot market during the last five years or so, the longtime London Metal Exchange trader estimated, a period when it traded at between 73 cents and $1.46 a pound. The added expense would have been passed on from traders to processors to manufacturers of goods containing copper to, eventually, consumers.
Mystery still surrounds the debacle, with many in the business puzzled about numerous aspects of Mr. Hamanaka's operation and increasingly skeptical that Sumitomo could have been in the dark for so long. In fact, Merrill Lynch & Company, which maintained two trading accounts used by Mr. Hamanaka, has said those accounts were authorized by his superiors, an arrangement that Sumitomo denies. It is not even clear whether anything Mr. Hamanaka did was illegal.
 
A Lack of Oversight
Self-Regulation With a Twist
What is clear, however, is that the copper market's loose structure enabled, if not encouraged, the kind of over-the-top trading that could lead to a multibillion-dollar loss:
*The London Metal Exchange, like many other British financial institutions, has been largely self-regulated, unfettered by the degree of government oversight that American exchanges receive. Historically, the London exchange's top officials hold interests in both the trading and mining of copper and other metals, leaving the exchange open to questions about possible conflicts of interest. The current chairman, Raj K. Bagri, together with his family owns a $600 million copper processing company, Metdist Ltd. When he took the chairman's job, which is unpaid, in 1993, Mr. Bagri assigned day-to-day operations to his son. American exchanges have stringent rules governing such holdings, including mandatory recusal from oversight responsibilities if a conflict arises. The London exchange apparently has less rigorous protections.
*The availability of information about trading, or the degree of so-called transparency, is limited on the exchange, which sets the benchmark price for copper. Only positions of 15,000 tons or more must be reported by exchange members, and then only privately to the exchange's chief executive. By contrast, members of the Comex, a division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, are required to publicly report positions of as little as 1,000 tons.
*Much trading here in copper and other metals is done over the counter in the form of futures contracts negotiated between two or more parties outside the official market, and thus beyond the London exchange's purview. In the United States, futures contracts must be traded on an exchange.
*Unlike the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the United States, which in recent years has pursued even minor trading violations with a Rottweiler-like intensity, the London exchange has relied on more gentle persuasion, typically calling in members and traders for a chat about transgressions. In extreme cases, the exchange has imposed limitations on prices to bring them in line with the real supply and demand, rather than impose sanctions against individuals who might have monkeyed with the market.
*Traders on the London exchange are allowed to meet daily margin calls with credit, rather than cash, letting them amass large positions without attracting the attention of their corporate treasurers, who would otherwise have to cut them checks. The Comex requires cash.
Even before the debacle, the London Metal Exchange was seeking to bring at least some, if not all, over-the-counter trading under its supervision, something that is now virtually a certainty.
But David E. King, chief executive of the exchange, staunchly defended its other idiosyncrasies as essential to London's success as a free and open market. He insisted that charges that it lacks regulatory zeal are merely sour grapes from the Comex, which has lost most of its market share in copper to London in recent years.
"The regulatory structure here since the mid-1980's has been very robust and in fact compares well with the regulatory environment in the United States," he said. "The complaints being made, in my view, are purely for competitive reasons."
 
Market Puppeteer
Smoke, Mirrors, Squeeze Plays
Still, Mr. Hamanaka was able to take full advantage of the London exchange's idiosyncrasies. While traders and regulators suspected that he was hoarding copper, for example, no one could be sure because he spread his trades among brokers, thus eluding the 15,000-ton reporting threshold.
In fact, most of his business was conducted in the over-the-counter market and thus out of regulatory reach. Mr. Hamanaka shunned the Comex, not only because it lacks the liquidity needed for the volume of trading he was doing, but also, he said in past interviews, because its regulations were too stringent.
And the London exchange, when it was first alerted to Mr. Hamanaka's problematic activities five years ago, thought it adequate to hold a discussion to air its concerns with him and another Sumitomo executive. Exchange officials were apparently satisfied with the explanation they received about a request for verification of fictitious trades that Mr. Hamanaka sought from an exchange member, David L. Threlkeld, in 1991. The officials were told that the request had been made only to resolve a tax matter in Japan and was of no relevance to the exchange.
In short, Mr. Hamanaka worked the copper market like a skilled puppeteer. In squeeze plays in 1991 and again in 1993, he used his control of large supplies of copper scattered around the globe to leverage prices sharply higher, traders said. Some even suspect that less blatant manipulation by Mr. Hamanaka kept copper prices at artificially high levels throughout the years that he was a star trader at Sumitomo.
 
New Players
Short-Sellers And Regulators
But late last summer, when Mr. Hama naka was preparing for a third squeeze, he found himself confronting vastly different forces in a market that had begun to develop defenses to his standard manipulation.
Following financial disasters at Kidder, Peabody, Barings, and Daiwa that were apparently orchestrated by rogue traders whose bosses were asleep at the switch so long as profits seemed to flow in, regulators in markets across the world were on red alert.
And since Mr. Hamanaka's last squeeze in 1993, hedge funds and other speculative investors had become active in the metals markets.
Such players as Tiger Management and George Soros's Quantum Fund, two of the largest and most successful hedge funds, looked at the price of copper last August -- when the spot price was $1.35 to $1.40 a pound -- cranked some supply figures through their economic models and decided prices were destined to fall.
They started going short -- borrowing and selling copper with the hope of buying it back later at a lower price, pocketing any difference as profit.
Meanwhile, traders believe, Mr. Hama naka was trying to push prices higher That meant whenever the funds sold, he or someone else had to buy to keep the price up.
The push-and-pull contest took on epic proportions. At one point earlier this year, brokers estimate, the hedge funds held almost one million metric tons of copper in short positions, an amount equal to nearly 8.5 percent of the world's total consumption of refined copper of 11.9 million tons last year.
And still the price did not fall far enough. Quantum finally dropped out of the fight in March, when prices declined somewhat, to about $1.15 to $1.18 a pound. Quantum has not said whether it made or lost money.
 
Numbers Crunch
Alarms Sound About a Glut
But there was more than hedge funds at work. Reports of rising stocks of copper started appearing late last summer, reports that the market initially ignored.
Statistics for copper and other metals had become unreliable for several reasons. The European Union, moving toward a single market in 1997, had begun calculating imports and exports among its member countries differently; the World Bureau of Statistics estimated that the new method resulted in an overstatement of copper consumption by 225,000 tons in 1993 and 250,000 tons in 1994.
The breakup of the Soviet Union also jumbled the data. Sometimes, Russia would not report trade with one or another former republic because it still regarded them as part of itself. And exports from Kazakhstan, a large copper-producing region, were underreported or not reported at all, which led analysts to underestimate supplies in the West.
Peter Hollands, an analyst at Bloomsbury Minerals Economics, a metals consulting firm in London, said that for a period last year, the discrepancy between the high and low estimates of copper stocks was roughly 600,000 tons.
Eventually, a growing number of analysts started sounding alarms about copper supplies outstripping demand.
 
Prodding From U.S.
Turning Up The Heat
Early in 1995, officials at the London exchange began to receive pointed letters from Mary L. Schapiro, then commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington. Ms. Schapiro, now head of Nasdaq's regulatory arm, had been trying to raise the commission's profile by cleaning up the commodities business, where someone always seems to be trying to corner a market, as the Hunts tried to do with silver in 1980.
The London exchange drew Ms. Schapiro's interest because of its plan to open a warehouse in Long Beach, Calif., for the storage and delivery of copper. The exchange had warehouses for other metals in the United States, but this one, which opened in April 1995, was widely regarded among traders as nothing short of a bold bid to take away enough business from the Comex to push it out of the copper market.
In a recent interview, Mr. King, the London exchange's chief executive, denied having such a goal. "The rationale for establishing Long Beach was to supply Southeast Asia," he said. "We could not keep up with demand out of our warehouse in Singapore, and while we would have liked to open one in Japan, Taiwan or South Korea, it would have taken more time."
Still, the Long Beach warehouse became a Pandora's box for the exchange, since it gave Ms. Schapiro a reason to look into its activities. Several members of the exchange's governing committee -- some say including Mr. King, who declined to disclose his vote -- had objected to opening the warehouse for just that reason, to no avail. "A considerable number of us knew that it was just going to get up the noses of the Americans," one member said.
In any event, in March 1995, Ms. Schapiro wrote a letter to Mr. Bagri, the exchange's chairman, expressing concerns. About six months later, the C.F.T.C. began investigating copper trading activities in London, seeking to determine their impact on the American market.
Officials of the C.F.T.C. say they started the inquiry because they felt frustrated in trying to obtain information about large market positions from their London counterparts. For their part, officials at the exchange have said British law constrains them from both gathering and sharing some of what was sought.
By late fall, spot prices for copper were vastly higher than prices for future delivery -- a reversal of the normal state of affairs since futures prices typically factor in interest costs and storage charges.
The reversal, a hallmark of earlier Hamanaka squeezes that is known as a backwardation, made no sense in light of mounting evidence that copper supplies exceeded demand. The London exchange and the Securities and Investments Board, something of a super-regulator of Britain's financial markets, joined the American agency in its search for an explanation.
This time, the exchange did not call Mr. Hamanaka and Sumitomo in for a chat. Instead, its board gave Mr. King a mandate to get to the bottom of the squeeze.
Some American traders speculate that the exchange and other British investigators got tougher because Mr. Hamanaka was now funneling much of his business through an American firm, the Global Minerals and Metals Corporation, instead of his traditional broker, Winchester Commodities. Winchester, which one trader described as the "longtime bete noire" of the London exchange, had ties to the British political establishment through Charles (Copper Fingers) Vincent, a member of the English elite who founded the firm.
In any case, Mr. King's investigative committee apparently failed to find a smoking gun. It disbanded without taking action, handing over the information it collected to the Securities and Investments Board.
Meanwhile, rumors that Sumitomo controlled 70 percent of the copper in the Long Beach warehouse -- an amount that would constitute a potent weapon in any attempt to further manipulate prices -- kept the C.F.T.C. in the investigation.
 
Day of Reckoning
Mr. Copper Finally Blinks
On May 17, when the spot price was $1.21 a pound, another rumor swept through the copper market, one big enough to make it move -- and fast. "Hamanaka had been removed from his post; Hamanaka had absconded with millions; Hamanaka had been given a promotion -- whatever version of the rumor you got, it all boiled down to Hamanaka's being out of the market," said one trader.
For reasons that remain unclear, Mr. Hamanaka, or more likely his superiors at Sumitomo, had finally blinked. When the hedge funds and other speculators sold short that day, no one answered by buying. Prices fell 12 percent in two days.
Sumitomo put out the word that Mr. Hamanaka had been promoted and would not be trading any longer. Prices continued to fall. And on June 16, the giant trading company said that "Mr. Copper" had been dismissed. Since then, copper has fallen to a low of 83 cents a pound on June 27, a drop of 31 percent since May 17. [It closed in London Thursday at 88 cents.]
The Securities and Investments Board is now conducting a review of the exchange with an eye toward ending some of its idiosyncrasies. Among other things, London is likely to gain more power to regulate non-members like Sumitomo.
But some fear one more negative result of the Sumitomo scandal -- that in the zeal to reform the market, regulators may go too far and cripple its free-wheeling nature. Its business would almost certainly dry up, for instance, were clients required to put up cash for daily margin calls.
"One of the beauties of the market is that it has limited regulation, which allows it to function fluidly," said Roman Borkowski, managing director of F.L.T. & Metals Ltd., a division of the Polish metals company Impex. "And one of the bad things is that it has limited regulation, which allows people, if they're big enough and rich enough, to abuse it. Somewhere, there has to be at least a narrow path between those two extremes."

HEADLINE: Freeholders Eliminate County Police In Hudson

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, July 11

 BODY:
The Hudson County Board of Freeholders said it had no choice, but when it voted this evening to disband the county's 82-officer Police Department, the officers who packed the meeting room said they had been betrayed.
"I've done good work for this department for 11 years," Officer Donald Dixon said. "We're getting stuck, and it's a hurting pain, because these are people who have lived and worked in this county." 
 In a loud and bitter meeting that lasted through the afternoon, officers and their supporters alternately pleaded and argued with the freeholders. More than 200 people spilled from the hot boardroom out into the hall, many wearing T-shirts that read, "Save the Hudson County Police/To Protect and Serve." But ultimately the board voted, 7 to 2, to eliminate the Police Department.
County officials have said the decision to close the department, whose members patrol the county's parks and roads and operate the county 911 emergency call system, reflects a cold economic reality: expenses rising faster than the county's tax base can support. The County Executive, Robert C. Janiszewski, has said he was forced to make drastic cuts by a $17 million shortfall on a $323 million budget. Closing the department would save about $3 million per year, county officials have said.
But opponents have argued that costs will merely be passed along to municipalities, whose officers will be forced to take up the county force's duties.
At least three other northern New Jersey counties -- Essex, Bergen and Union -- have small county departments that supplement municipal forces, as Hudson's does. But officials in those counties have said they plan to maintain their departments.
The Hudson County force contrasts with a large, full-service county operation like that of Suffolk County in New York State, which acts as the primary law enforcement agency in its area.
But the supporters of the Hudson County department have said the officers provide experienced backup for municipal officers, and relieve them of the burden of patrolling highways and parks. The county public safety director, Glenn Cunningham, told the Board of Freeholders that municipalities would have to begin assigning officers to patrol those areas.
"A sham is being played on you freeholders," Mr. Cunningham said.
In 1995, Hudson County police officers issued 47,800 tickets and responded to 1,916 accidents on the 15 county roads they patrol. They made 579 arrests, including 40 in county parks, and also arrested 154 people on warrants.
One of the blows to the department came from a reorganization of the state courts, which now send revenues from motor vehicle tickets to the municipality in which they are issued rather than to the county. The Hudson County police used to receive $3 million in revenue from traffic summonses, about the same amount the county expects to save by eliminating the department.

HEADLINE: Broader Warrants Issued for 2 Bosnian Serbs

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS 

DATELINE: THE HAGUE, July 11

 BODY:
The United Nations war crimes tribunal issued international arrest warrants today for the Bosnian Serbs' political leader, Radovan Karadzic, and their military chief, Gen. Ratko Mladic, who are charged with genocide and other crimes in the four-year Bosnian war.
The warrants oblige members of the United Nations to arrest the men if they enter their countries. But the warrants are unlikely to have any immediate effect because Western countries have not been willing to have their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia seek the two leaders out. 
 For the first time, the tribunal also called publicly for an investigation to determine whether President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia shares responsibility for war crimes in the Bosnian conflict. The Bosnian fighting has taken tens of thousands of lives, uprooted millions of people and adding "ethnic cleansing" to the world's vocabulary.
By openly extending the tribunal's inquiry to Mr. Milosevic, the three-judge panel has taken a step that some Western officials had hoped to postpone, since they see the cooperation of the Serbian President, who faces a reimposition of sanctions, as vital to the continuing peace effort.
The tribunal has reportedly been secretly gathering evidence about Mr. Milosevic for some time. But today the three judges made formal a decision to investigate whether the Serbian President -- who supported the neighboring Bosnian Serbs in their effort to conquer parts of Bosnia -- should be held accountable for crimes committed in the military campaign, such as deliberate, large-scale killings of civilians.
Judge Claude Jorda of France, who first read out charges against Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic, said the court had no choice but to ask the prosecution "to investigate decision-making responsibility at the same, or higher level."
Documents and testimony in the hands of the court, he said, suggested "that a plan existed, designed at the highest Serbian political and military level, to set up a new state through the use of violence" in Bosnia. Judge Jorda avoided using Mr. Milosevic's name at this point. But in their written decision, the judges referred to communications in 1991 in which Mr. Milosevic and Dr. Karadzic discussed their plans for the coming war.
In an interview, a court official said the call to investigate "higher levels of responsibility" amounted to an announcement that the tribunal was looking into the Serbian President's possible personal responsibility for war crimes.
The issuing of international arrest warrants against the two central figures of the Bosnian war is the strongest measure the tribunal can take, short of trying the accused, which it cannot do in their absence.
Indictments and local arrest warrants for the two men were issued last year and sent to the authorities in Belgrade, Pale (the Bosnian Serb headquarters) and Sarajevo, and to the Governments of Britain, France, the United States and Switzerland. The tribunal is essentially the creation of Western countries, which, however, have been unwilling to have peacekeeping troops in Bosnia arrest the the leaders, or to use economic sanctions to press the Bosnian Serbs or Serbia to hand them over to The Hague, as called for under the Dayton peace accords.
With the new arrest warrants, which are broader than the existing ones, the tribunal hopes to increase pressure on the West to have the suspects arrested. But if a country refuses, the tribunal can do little more than complain to the United Nations Security Cuncil.
Christian Chartier, a spokesman for the court, said that today's decision "puts the burden on the international community to live up to its commitment to the court and carry out its decisions."
The arrest warrants and call for investigation of Mr. Milosevic came a year after the Bosnian Serb takeover of the town of Srebrenica. Western officials believe that thousands of Muslim men and boys were massacred in the following days, an event that figures prominently in the indicments of the two leaders.
As part of its effort to press the West to arrest the Bosnian Serb leaders, for the past two weeks the tribunal has held hearings to present evidence against them. The fate of Srebrenica and of many other Muslim towns and villages was described in detail.
"War and darkness descended upon Bosnia and Herzegovina, a culturally rich and diverse land and the toll in human lives has been enormous," the prosecutor said. "The fury and cruelty of ethnic cleansing have shocked the conscience of the world."
The prosecutors said that in addition to the killing, torture and rape of tens of thousands of civilians, Bosnian Serbs destroyed 1,123 mosques, 504 Roman Catholic churches, 5 synagogues and had also targeted cemeteries and monasteries in their effort to create purely Serbian regions. While some Croats and Muslims also committed atrocities, Bosnian Serb crimes were more systematic and centrally directed, officials have charged.
In his summary today, Judge Jorda said "Ethnic cleansing, it seems, was not the byproduct of the war, but rather its aim."
In announcing today's ruling, the three-judge panel unanimously confirmed the existing indictments against Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic.
In their ruling today, the judges also expanded other charges against Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic. In the indictments, the two leaders have been charged with "command responsibility" for genocide and other crimes of war. But the judges ruled that they are also "personally responsible" for the crimes with which they are charged, a definition which aggravates their culpability. The court's decision said that Dr. Karadzic and General Mladic "were not only informed of the crimes allegedly committed under their authority, but also, and in particular, they exercised their power in order to plan, instigate, order or otherwise aid and abet in the planning, preparation and execution of the said crimes."
The judges said that the offenses were committed in keeping with "a political program and institutional and military organizations."

HEADLINE: Market Place: Stocks Plunge on More Signs of Weaker Corporate Earnings;
Some Wonder if Party's Over For Technology High-Fliers

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The list of corporate casualties in the technology field is lengthening. It's easy to dismiss an Apple Computer or a Digital Equipment as troubled companies bedeviled by problems of their own making. But with two blue-chip bellwethers, Motorola and Hewlett-Packard, surprising Wall Street this week with announcements of slowing business, it raises questions about the outlook for technology shares in general.
Skittish investors expressed their concerns yesterday by driving the price of technology stocks down sharply. The Pacific Stock Exchange index of 100 technology companies fell more than 4 percent yesterday, and the technology index has dropped more than 17 percent in less than two months. 
 Yesterday's selloff was prompted by a statement from the Hewlett-Packard Company late Wednesday, after markets had closed, that orders for its computers and printers were slowing. Lewis E. Platt, the chairman, acknowledged that he did not know whether the slowdown was seasonal or "a fundamental shift in the business climate."
High marks for candor, but head-scratching uncertainty is not what technology investors want to hear from the head of the second-largest computer maker. Hence the rush to the exits. Shares of Hewlett-Packard fell $10.625, to $78.375. And the retreat was indiscriminate, hitting all the major technology companies: Microsoft down $5, to $114.50; Intel down $3.375, to $69.50; I.B.M. off $2.875, to $96, and Compaq down $2.875, to $43.75. .
The easing of technology-stock prices has come in waves, starting with semiconductor shares last fall. Bruce Lupatkin, director of research for Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco, calls it a "rolling correction." But he added: "It's really been in the last three weeks that we've had consistently ugly days. A lot of people feel that it's over for technology stocks."
Investors, Mr. Lupatkin notes, are going to be giving the earnings reports of all technology companies close scrutiny as more of them report financial results for the quarter ended in June. A few of those reports, depending on how the results square with Wall Street expectations, could steady or unsettle the technology sector.
For example, Intel, the chip maker, will report its results after the market closes next Tuesday. Microsoft, the software leader, will announce its quarterly results after the market closes on July 22. Compaq, the leading producer of personal computers, will report on July 24. And I.B.M., the largest computer maker, reports on July 25.
Many analysts insisted yesterday's rout was a hasty overreaction. Technology stocks are notoriously volatile but, they say, the long-term outlook for them remains bright. "I think this is the panic bottom," said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter.
The underlying trend of continued heavy investment in information technology, economists say, shows no sign of letting up. Spending on computers and telecommunications now represents 40 percent of total capital spending by corporate America, up steadily from 20 percent in 1981, when I.B.M. introduced its first personal computer.
"I don't know about Hewlett-Packard, but the explosive upward trajectory of investment in information technology is not slowing down," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist of Morgan Stanley & Company. "Corporate America's addiction to technology has never been greater."
The upward trend in technology investment has been mirrored in stock prices. Since October 1990, the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index has increased nearly fourfold, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has doubled.
Yet the long view is often scant comfort to investors on Wall Street, where history is defined as yesterday's trading. Besides, as recently as a few weeks ago, analysts were confidently predicting that the bottom had been reached in technology stocks, only to see things get worse.
"We've seen not only depressed financial results, but they're depressing," said Rick Whittington, an analyst for the Soundview Financial Group in Stamford, Conn. "We need to see encouraging results from some of the leading technology companies in the next week or two."

Trampled Dreams

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Ask Cicih Sukaesih about her dreams and you will hear a long, long silence. She has none. In Indonesia, a woman who is 32 years old, unmarried, broke and unemployed keeps her thoughts focused on the short term. Each day is an emergency.
Ms. Sukaesih used to earn about a dollar a day working in a factory that made athletic shoes for one of the world's premier marketers of dreams, Nike Inc. It wasn't much of a living. A study of women in similar circumstances in 1989 had shown that 88 percent were malnourished. 
 In 1991 the legally required minimum wage was raised to a dazzling $1.25 a day. But the operators of the Sung Hwa Dunia factory in Serang, West Java, where Ms. Sukaesih worked, refused to pay it. The staggering wealth of the big shots at the top of Nike's pyramid depends on the laborers at the bottom being paid next to nothing. This time the laborers balked. Six hundred workers who were barely earning enough to feed themselves walked out of the Sung Hwa Dunia plant. The police and the military, trained to suppress labor unrest, were quickly alerted. Investigations were begun. The 600 workers walked back in.
Still, an example had to be made. In January 1992, Ms. Sukaesih and 23 others who had dared to demand that their employers pay the minimum wage were dismissed.
I talked with Ms. Sukaesih by phone Wednesday night. Speaking through an interpreter, she described the working conditions in the factory. "We were not treated with respect," she said. "Many of the supervisors were from Korea. They yelled at us. There were some that liked to hit people, slap people. There were some who would kick the Muslim workers when they were praying during their lunch break."
The factory has since been taken over by different operators (also under contract to Nike) and the name has been changed to Eltri Indo Footwear. The abusive practices reportedly have ceased and the minimum wage, now a little over $2 a day, is being paid. But Ms. Sukaesih and her co-workers have not been rehired. They have sued and their case is now languishing before the Indonesian supreme court.
Ms. Sukaesih will be in the United States next week to tell her story. Her trip is being paid for by labor and human rights activists who want Nike to settle the claims of workers who have been unfairly dismissed, and agree to independent monitoring as a safeguard against abuses in the factories.
Ms. Sukaesih has no money of her own and her prospects are dim. She is already considered old for factory work. "They want young girls," she said. "At my age you have to pay a bribe to a security guard just to apply for a job."
Meanwhile, the women who are working are only marginally better off than Ms. Sukaesih. There is a widely held notion -- and Philip Knight, Nike's chief executive officer, does nothing to discourage it -- that minimum-wage workers in Indonesia are paid enough to live reasonably comfortable lives. That is not so.
Many of the working women live in bamboo or tin dwellings with no running water and nothing in the way of appliances. Apong Herlina, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Institute, tells the heartbreaking story of women from the countryside who have come to the cities for work but do not earn enough to have their children with them. The children remain in the country, being cared for by relatives.
"These women work a tremendous amount," Ms. Herlina said, "but there is not enough money for transportation or time to travel the long distances to visit their children. They see them once a year, during holiday. The rest of the year they grieve."
Dreams fade into nothingness in the long, grim hours in the factories. The workers who live with their children face a struggle each day just to feed them. And then it's back to work in the shadow of the Nike "Swoosh."
The system works fabulously for Mr. Knight and his team of celebrity hucksters, led by the inimitable Michael Jordan. Mr. Knight's holdings were recently estimated at more than $5 billion. I spoke with Mr. Knight on Wednesday, too. He noted that Indonesians were lining up for jobs in factories that make Nikes. And he said that it would wreck the country's economy if wages were allowed to get too high.
"How much would you pay them?" he asked.

HEADLINE: Netanyahu, in New York, Promotes His Views on Peace and Invites Investments

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
Returning with new stature to an intimately familiar venue, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel switched his oratorial skill and boyish charm to full volume yesterday as he urged New York City's Jewish population to embrace his approach to peace in the Middle East and to invigorating the Israeli economy.
In a polyrhythmic opening day of a three-day visit -- his first as Prime Minister -- to New York, the loquacious Mr. Netanyahu spoke in ballrooms packed with Jewish leaders, met with politicians and lunched with businessmen on Wall Street, all in a tightly choreographed effort to find common ground and mitigate differences among a population he feels is important to his success. 
 He sounded many of the same themes that he had evoked during his two days in Washington, but to a decidedly different and divided audience, including many who are deeply skeptical, if not hostile, toward his ideology.
Seeking to calm the apprehensions of many New York Jews, Mr. Netanyahu, 46, spent an hour fielding questions from a gathering of 400 people sponsored by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
He reiterated his emphasis on Israeli security and his devotion to privatizing the economy.
Pressed on his hard-line views on achieving peace in the Middle East, he said: "It is reciprocity. We keep commitments. You keep commitments. We insist the deal be kept on both sides."
Once again, he declared that "Jerusalem has to remain undivided, with one government, not two."
On the matter of Palestinian aspirations, he said: "I'm going to say to the Palestinians, you run your own affairs. We're not interested in running your lives, so long as Israelis gain security."
On another issue of great concern to non-Orthodox Jews, his intimations that he would roll back gains made by Conservative and Reform movements in Israel, Mr. Netanyahu was emphatic: "We'd said we'd preserve the status quo. We stand our ground. We'll keep the status quo."
For the most part, the Prime Minister was nimble in his handling of questions, though not entirely lifting the clouds of ambiguity from his positions.
The audience was polite if not overly enthusiastic in its response. Rabbi Norman Patz of Cedar Grove, N.J., though more liberal in viewpoint than the Prime Minister, said, "I'm very impressed by his ability to think on his feet."
At an address in the evening to a more diverse crowd of some 3,000 people invited by the Jewish Community Relations Council, Mr. Netanyahu received an appreciably more exuberant reception. He was interrupted several times by standing ovations, and the event seemed to take on the feel of a pep rally.
The Prime Minister spoke passionately about the importance of Jewish continuity and unity. "It seems to me that the great task of Zionism today," he said, "is to reinforce Jewish identity." He implored Americans, especially young people, to go to Israel in a "physical and spiritual airlift."
Afterward, his security agents were to usher him quickly from the ballroom at the Sheraton New York Hotel, but to their dismay he jumped down from the stage and waded into the huge crowd, shaking hands and exchanging cordialities.
Much of his day had been devoted to impressing on his audiences his dedication to economic reform.
In a luncheon address before some 150 business and financial executives in the board room of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Netanyahu made a strong plea for investment in Israel, which he said would pay bountiful dividends as he carries out his pledge to privatize and deregulate the Israeli economy.
It marked the first time a Prime Minister of Israel had visited the stock exchange, and may well have been the first kosher lunch (grilled chicken) served there.
Introduced by Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics heir who has been an ardent supporter, Mr. Netanyahu, who does not adhere to a Kosher diet, nevertheless made a point of thanking his hosts for the kosher food. "That's essential when you try to keep coalitions together," he said. "Don't knock it."
In a brief talk, he vowed that he would succeed in privatizing state-owned industry, lifting regulatory barriers and lowering taxes. "I think Israel has the greatest potential of any economy in the world," he said. "That's because we have twin curses that become twin blessings." He identified these as the fact that Israel has a strong scientific and technological base because of its large defense industry, and the fact that Israel has not had capitalism, meaning no obsolete industries to dismember.
"My bottom line -- I hate to use the word bottom line -- is I'd like you to come to Israel because it's good for Israel, and I'd like you to come to Israel because you'll make money," he said.
Yielding to the security concerns of the Israeli agents who attended him, he demurred from strolling the stock trading floor, as visiting dignitaries customarily do. But he did make a brief appearance at the floor's podium, at a time when the stock market was 132 points in retreat.
"I don't know what to say: 'Buy, Sell, Buy, Sell,' " he said. Given the turmoil on the floor, the traders screamed, "Buy," and he responded in kind.
Mr. Netanyahu is a comfortable presence in New York City, where he has many friends from the 1980's when he was Israel's delegate to the United Nations. He attended high school and college in the United States and worked as a management consultant during his 16 years in this country.
Throughout the morning, as he held court for local political leaders at his suite at the Stanhope Hotel on Fifth Avenue and 81st Street, several hundred people stood transfixed across the street, cordoned off behind metal fencing, anxious for a glimpse of the young and charismatic Prime Minister.
Mr. Netanyahu began the day with perfunctory visits with Gov. George E. Pataki and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. Governor Pataki said they spoke about trade and peace, and joked about the fact that both of their election campaigns were orchestrated by Arthur Finkelstein.
Governor Whitman, after her brief visit, said that the Prime Minister wanted to know about her privatization and tax reduction efforts in New Jersey.
The Prime Minister also received Bob Dole, who told Mr. Netanyahu that ties with Israel will be stronger if he is elected President. The Prime Minister danced away from even the suggestion of an endorsement. Mr. Dole also jokingly told the Prime Minister that he "wanted to look up his pollster."
In the afternoon, Mr. Netanyahu met with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a friend for 12 years, and told him that he admired some of his moves in shifting city functions to the private sector and planned to borrow from those ideas. "It turns out that New York and Israel are not that different in this matter," Mr. Netanyahu told the Mayor. He also complimented Mr. Giuliani on making the city cleaner and better in several ways than it was when he was living here.
The Prime Minister collected a bevy of mementoes during his trips around the city. After the stock exchange luncheon, the chairman of the exchange gave him a Bull and Bear statue that he said he would take to the Knesset as "the weapon of choice."
The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations gave him two Mets jackets, one for him and one for his wife. He was told that "Mets" actually stood for "Middle East Terrorist Stopper."
"I can only hope these are flak jackets," Mr. Netanyahu said.

HEADLINE: President Announces Plan To Encourage School Repair

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 11

 BODY:
Seeking to expand the Federal role in repairing public schools, President Clinton announced today that he would ask Congress for $5 billion to help straighten sagging roofs, seal cracked foundations and fix other problems nationwide over the next four years.
While acknowledging that education is a major issue in the President's re-election campaign, officials said formulation of the new program was prompted partly by reports by the General Accounting Office over the last year and a half that found $112 billion in pressing construction needs, including poor heating, broken plumbing, and electrical wiring that is inadequate for running computers. 
 "Too many school buildings and classrooms are literally a shambles," Mr. Clinton said today in the White House Rose Garden. "We cannot expect our children and our teachers to build strong lives on a crumbling foundation."
Administration officials said they were still working on a formula for awarding the money, but that it would be weighted toward the neediest communities. One Administration official said New York State could expect as much as $400 million to $500 million.
The officials said they would ask Congress to allocate the money from the one-time auction of part of the broadcast spectrum.
Under the plan, the Federal dollars would not be spent directly on the schools. Instead, the Federal Government would pay up to half the cost of the interest on the tax-exempt bonds typically issued to pay for school construction.
As a result, Mr. Clinton predicted that the $5 billion Federal investment would prompt a total of $20 billion in school repairs and renovation.
In keeping with the themes of personal responsibility and shared community values that are forming the backbone of his campaign, Mr. Clinton stressed today that he was not seeking to dictate solutions or supplant local responsibilities.
"Our school construction initiative would be flexible," Mr. Clinton said. "It would give communities and states the power to decide how to use the new resources. It would help those who help themselves, requiring local communities to take responsibility for this effort."
Independent groups were quick to praise the plan.
"It doesn't do all things for all people, but it's the first major and most substantial Federal response to school repair needs that we've ever seen," said Michael Casserly, executive director of Council of the Great City Schools, a coalition of the nation's largest urban public school systems. "And it's also significant the way that they've done it: essentially leveraging and encouraging additional efforts locally."
Administration officials said that of the nation's 17,000 school districts, 100 to 125 with the highest number of children in poverty could apply for subsidies directly to the Department of Education. Among these districts is New York City, where many schools still burn coal for heat.
Other districts would apply to the states. Mr. Casserly praised that feature of the plan, saying that at the state level, poor districts "tend to get less than their fair share."
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's national economic adviser, said the plan's costs would be covered by the proceeds from auctioning portions of the broadcast spectrum between Channels 60 and 69.
"The new digital technology has essentially freed up some new space on the broadcast spectrum," Dr. Tyson said, "and that means the space can be used without disturbing the TV broadcasting that's already going on."
The Federal Government has traditionally had a minor role in maintaining schools, and officials emphasized that they intended the program to last no longer than four years.
Mr. Clinton originally planned to announce the program today in Tampa, Fla., in a state he narrowly lost in 1992. But with Hurricane Bertha threatening, the White House shifted the ceremony here.

HEADLINE: Council Seeks Raise for Contract Workers

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Upset that many companies doing work for New York City pay their workers the minimum wage, the City Council overwhelmingly approved a bill yesterday that would require those private contractors to pay 3,500 workers far more.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's aides said that he might veto the bill, which is expected to raise the city's contracting costs by $15 million a year. But after yesterday's 41-to-7 vote, City Council members voiced near certainty that they could override a veto and make New York one of the first cities to pass legislation mandating higher wages for employees of city contractors. 
 "I don't think we in the city should be in the business of substandard wages, wages lower than what the private sector pays," said Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed, a Manhattan Democrat who is one of the bill's chief sponsors. "This will give these workers more personal dignity and will mean many of them will no longer need food stamps or welfare."
The bill would require city contractors in four areas -- security, cleaning, food service and temporary office work -- to pay the prevailing rate for private-sector workers doing similar jobs. Council officials estimated that this would raise the wages of unarmed security guards to $7.25 an hour, food workers to $9 an hour and temporary office workers to about $11.25 an hour.
In an interview, First Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers stopped short of saying that Mr. Giuliani would veto the bill, which many supporters call a "living wage bill."
Mr. Powers said: "We have serious concerns about the bill. It increases the cost of the budget, which means we're going to have to cut somewhere else in the budget to pay for the increased cost, and the Council hasn't identified where to cut." He added that the Mayor believes the wage problem should be dealt with through a national minimum-wage bill because "it keeps us competitive if every area of the country is paying high wages."
Several Council members said that the Mayor, facing what would be his sixth veto override, might be thinking twice about vetoing a bill for which church groups and labor unions have lobbied intensely as part of a nationwide effort to have cities, states and Federal legislators raise wages for low-end workers.
In the past, mayoral aides attacked proposals for such a bill on the ground that it would increase the city's budget deficit and send out an image that New York was a place where big government was once again seeking to strangle business. Indeed, in attacking the bill, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said, "We might as well dust off the Communist Manifesto."
Sheldon S. Leffler of Queens, one of three Democrats to vote against the bill, said, "Government interference in the wage market will reduce the competitiveness of New York City and discourage investment and economic growth here."
Last year Councilman Sal F. Albanese proposed a version of the bill that would provide employees of city contractors $12.10 an hour plus health benefits. But as the price of letting the bill go to a vote, City Council President Peter F. Vallone pushed to have the wage minimum reduced and the benefits requirement eliminated, partly so it would be less of a strain on the city budget.
Opponents of the bill say that contractors, having to pay higher wages, will pass the cost on to the city by submitting higher bids; some supporters say that contractors will merely swallow the difference.
Nonetheless, Mr. Albanese does not hide the fact that he hopes to use the bill as a weapon in his campaign for mayor.
"When the New York City Council acts, the entire nation watches," said Mr. Albanese. "It's a landmark piece of legislation." He noted that he had been asked to testify before Chicago's City Council next week because it is considering similar legislation.
Similar laws have been enacted in Baltimore, and bills are being considered in Los Angeles and St. Paul.
In New York and around the country, the labor movement has pushed hard for such a law to show its concerns for low-paid workers and to help derail efforts to contract out or privatize municipal work. Very often the main reason that private companies can provide services more cheaply is that they pay lower wages.
"Today's bill is an excellent first step toward assuring a fair wage package for the lowest-paid among us."said Brian McLaughlin, president of the New York City Central Labor Council, the federation of the city's trade unions.

HEADLINE: 102 DAYS TARDY, ALBANY REACHES DEAL ON BUDGET

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Friday, July 12

 BODY:
Finally producing what has become the tardiest state budget in the nation's history, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature announced a $66 billion spending plan on Thursday that rejects most of the cuts and policy changes that Mr. Pataki had advocated.
The Governor and legislative leaders ended a long, rancorous stalemate by reaching a compromise late Wednesday night on several issues that had held up a final agreement, including Mr. Pataki's plan to overhaul the state's $5 billion workers' compensation system. 
 The budget was due on April 1, but for the 12th straight year, state leaders failed to meet that deadline. The National Conference of State Legislatures believes no other state has ever approved a budget this late.
The Legislature began moving the budget bills toward passage on Thursday night, and the State Assembly met well into the early morning. But until the final bill is passed, probably tonight or Saturday, the record for lateness, now at 103 days, keeps growing.
The Legislature restored about $1.45 billion in cuts that Mr. Pataki had called for, mostly in Medicaid, which pays for medical care for the poor, and for higher education as well as welfare. One result is there will be no tuition increases for SUNY and CUNY students, officials said.
Mr. Pataki also did not get approval of several far-reaching criminal justice and welfare proposals he had offered. He had called for the state to eliminate parole for all violent felons and toughen its treatment of juvenile offenders, but those plans were turned down. He also asked for time limits on welfare and cuts in benefits. The Democratic-controlled Assembly, the Governor's main rival in Albany, responded with its own plan for time limits, but Mr. Pataki labeled it too weak and the two sides could not find a compromise, so the whole idea was dropped.
Mr. Pataki, who as a candidate repeatedly vowed to put a stop to the tradition of tardy budgets, said this afternoon that the people of the state should focus on the contents of the budget, not when it was approved.
"Absolutely, it was worth the wait and worth the fight," he said.
The Governor said the agreement would continue his drive to reduce the state's spending and cut taxes. When counting all the money in the budget, including Federal funds, state spending will actually increase a bit. But Mr. Pataki noted that when only the state's own money was counted, spending would decline slightly. The budget also includes a promise from the Legislature to pass an environmental bond act that the Governor proposed last month. The act, which voters must approve in November, would authorize the state to borrow $1.75 billion for environmental projects.
The deal also keeps in place the second phase of a three-part cut in state income taxes that the Governor pushed through the Legislature last year.
Still, the agreement seemed to underscore that this has been a difficult legislative session for the Governor, who proposed his budget on Dec. 15, a month early, hoping to insure that it would not be late. At the time, Mr. Pataki called for cuts and policies based on the assumption that the Federal Government would revamp rules for Medicaid and welfare.
When President Clinton and Republican leaders in Congress could not agree on those regulations, Mr. Pataki's budget fell apart, and he later had to present a revised plan to the Legislature.
The Governor successfully moved many of his proposals through the Legislature last year, his first year in office. But this time, he found more resistance, even from his Republican allies who are the majority in the State Senate. The Senate and the Assembly are up for election this year, and members of both houses wanted to spend more to curry favor with voters.
Mr. Pataki, who became the state's first Republican governor in a generation when he was elected in 1994, is not up for re-election until 1998. He had proposed the cuts in his original budget plan to help pay for his income tax cut. But with the economy improving, less cuts were needed. Legislative leaders said the state's revenues were running more than $700 million higher than they estimated in December.
The leaders said they would pay for the rest of the proposed cuts through $1.3 billion in one-time revenue sources, including taking $481 million from a fund that pays for medical malpractice settlements. They also lowered their estimates of how much programs like Medicaid would cost the state in the next year.
As they had in past years, fiscal monitors criticized the one-time revenues being used to cover recurring costs. They also bemoaned the inability of the state's leaders to reach an agreement on time, pointing out that the lateness has contributed to giving New York one of the lowest bond ratings of any state. The low ratings raise the cost of interest when the state borrows, which ultimately results in less money for schools and a host of other items in the budget.
Mr. Pataki won concessions from the Assembly on cutting the costs of the state's $5 billion workers' compensation system. The Assembly also agreed to proposals by the Republican majority in the Senate to cut business taxes.
The tax cuts, on real estate sales, petroleum, property and other items, will save businesses about $83 million in the next fiscal year, rising to more than $250 million annually in about three years.
The Governor and legislative leaders also agreed on a amnesty program for people who have not paid their state taxes. The program is expected to yield about $150 million to $200 million, officials said.
One issue that propelled the budget talks to completion on Wednesday night was the expiration of a state law that protects thousands of loft tenants in New York City. Mr. Pataki and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, had threatened to let the law lapse if the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, did not accede to changes in the workers' compensation system.
Finally, at about 11:45 P.M., the three men emerged from Mr. Pataki's office to announce that they had reached agreement, and Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver then rushed over to the Legislature to pass a 36-hour extension on the loft law.
As part of the final budget agreement announced on Thursday, the Legislature is to extend the loft law for three years, officials said.
Legislative leaders spent the afternoon praising the aspects of the budget that they believed would appeal to their constituencies.
Mr. Silver, who had crusaded against Mr. Pataki's proposed cuts, repeatedly noted that the Legislature had made restorations in spending.
The budget now "takes care of the working men and women of New York," Mr. Silver said. "It takes care of the middle class of New York, it takes care of the education needs of New Yorkers, it takes care of the health care needs of New Yorkers."
Mr. Silver noted that the agreement included a plan from the Assembly that would cut the state's 4 percent sales tax on clothing for one week next winter for items worth less than $500 as an experiment to see whether it would generate more economic activity.
Mr. Bruno, who has close ties to business groups, praised the business tax cuts that the Senate majority championed, saying that the state had made a serious error by enacting them in the first place.
"We are doing some really great things on behalf of the people of this state," Mr. Bruno said.

Chart: "The Long Road to a Budget Agreement"
 
Dec. 15 Gov. George E. Pataki presents his $63.8 billion budget. To close a projected deficit and pay for tax cuts, his plan seeks steep reductions in spending on Medicaid, welfare and higher education. In a foretaste of rhetorical battles to come, the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, calls the plan "a thinly veiled attempt to destroy the middle class of this state." Joseph L. Bruno, a Republican who is the Senate majority leader and Mr. Pataki's most powerful ally in the Legislature, acknowledges that it might need "fine-tuning."
 
Jan. 3 Mr. Pataki uses his second State of the State address to try to drum up legislative support for his austerity budget, a difficult task in an election year.
 
March 11 Senator Bruno calls on the Governor to rewrite his budget, saying it depends too heavily on Federal actions that seem increasingly unlikely to happen. "If we are going to deal with the budget in the real world," Mr. Bruno says, "then we have to deal with real numbers."
 
March 15 Mr. Pataki goes to Washington to press for changes in Federal welfare and Medicaid laws that could save New York State $2 billion in the coming fiscal year. Despite threatening harsh new cuts if Washington does not help, he is rebuffed.
 
March 16 In a surprise announcement, Mr. Pataki says he has found $1.4 billion in additional money that will enable him to avoid painful new spending cuts.
 
March 28 The Governor and legislative leaders abandon their effort to pass a budget on time because of the budget impasse in Washington. They agree instead to a stopgap spending measure that freezes state spending at current levels for four weeks while also allowing a previously approved tax cut to take effect.

April 1 The state's new fiscal year begins, with no budget.
 
May 6 With the budget six weeks late, Mr. Silver steps up his attacks against Mr. Pataki, accusing him of trying to undermine public schools and of paying skimpy attention to stalled budget negotiations.

May 22 After weeks of negotiations, Republican and Democratic legislative leaders offer a budget proposal intended to jump-start the molasses-slow negotiations. Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver say their budget will spend $1.2 billion more than Mr. Pataki's, mainly on schools, the state university system and health care programs.
 
May 27 The Governor's budget office attacks the bipartisan budget proposal as $1.2 billion out of balance and filled with irresponsible election-year spending.
 
May 30 Mr. Pataki says he will ask the Legislature to provide aid to public schools through March 1997, a move that would relieve the single greatest pressure on him and the Legislature to reach a budget agreement soon. This plan also dies in the Legislature.
 
June 5 Budget talks collapse in disarray and acrimony. Both houses of the Legislature vow to pass sharply different budgets, though neither plan is likely to be acceptable to the other house -- or to Mr. Pataki.

June 8 At 4:52 A.M., the long-overdue budget becomes the longest-overdue budget.
 
June 27 The Governor and legislative leaders emerge from a three-hour negotiating session saying they were making progress but still trying hard to enact a spending plan by July 4.
 
June 30 The Governor and legislative leaders announce that they have an agreement on a plan to deregulate the state's hospitals. Saying they are making great headway on budget negotiations, they also agree to extend a law protecting thousands of New York City loft residents, many in Mr. Silver's district, for three days while negotiations continue.
 
July 3 Mr. Pataki and the leaders concede that they cannot meet their goal of enacting the budget by July 4 and the Legislature adjourns for the holiday weekend after extending the loft law for another week. The Governor's aides make it clear that he will hold the budget hostage to gain concessions from the Democrats on a plan to revamp the workers' compensation system.
 
July 9 On the 100th day that the budget has been late and workers' compensation talks deadlocked, Mr. Bruno repeats his pledge not to extend the loft law again until there are budget bills ready to be passed.
 
July 10 Just hours before the loft law is about to lapse, Mr. Pataki and the leaders announce an agreement on revamping the workers' compensation system, opening the way for final budget passage.
 
July 11 Mr. Pataki and the leaders announce that they have reached a budget agreement.

NEW YORK
 
Finally, a State Budget
Producing the latest state budget in the nation's history, Governor Pataki and the State Legislature announced a $66 billion spending plan that rejects most of the budget cuts and policy changes that Mr. Pataki had advocated. Ending a long and sometimes rancorous stalemate, the Governor and legislative leaders released details of the budget, including Mr. Pataki's plan to overhaul New York State's $5 billion workers' compensation system. [Page A1.]
 
The budget deal gave all sides something to walk away with. [B5.]
 
Dismal Look at Welfare Agency
Eight months after Elisa Izquierdo's death highlighted the failings of the city's child welfare system, social workers, housing court judges and government officials say the agency charged with protecting the city's most vulnerable adults is just as flawed. They say its mistakes and oversights in dealing with the very old, the abused and the mentally ill have resulted in continuing abuse, homelessness and, sometimes, even death. [A1.]
 
Freedom, Coffee and Advice
At the corner of Jackson Avenue and Queens Plaza South, beneath a billboard image of the Statue of Liberty, the City Department of Correction releases several hundred inmates a week. In their first acts as free men, some grab a beer or a pack of cigarettes. Others head for a coffee cart operated by Seema Sandhir, who has worked the corner for two years. She offers milk and sugar, and a word of advice: "Don't do it next time. Be a good boy." [B1.]
 
Term Limits Back on Ballot
Three years after New Yorkers voted overwhelmingly to impose term limits on the city's elected officials, they will be asked to reconsider their decision in a vote this fall on whether to extend the limit from 8 years to 12. The City Council, which vigorously opposed term limits in 1993, voted overwhelmingly to place a referendum on the November ballot asking voters to allow the mayor, comptroller, public advocate, borough presidents and Council members to hold office for 12 years. [B1.]
 
The Council approved a bill requiring contractors to increase the pay of 3,500 workers. [B2.]
 
Relations in Awkward Stage
What was left unchanged on Benjamin Netanyahu's first day in town as the Israeli Prime Minister was an awareness among many Jews whose hearts are in both New York City and Jerusalem that their relationship with Israel has entered a new, uncertain stage. To a degree, so has their self-identity. NYC by Clyde Haberman. [B1.]
 
Netanyahu Courts New York
Returning with new stature to an intimately familiar venue, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel switched on his oratorical skill and boyish charm to full volume as he urged New York City's Jewish population to embrace his approach to peace in the Middle East and to invigorating the Israeli economy. [B3.]
Politicians all but lined up to be seen with the new Israeli leader, and he was only too happy to oblige. [B3.]
 
Melee After Boxing Match
Fans and boxing handlers brawled at Madison Square Garden last night after the heavyweight Riddick Bowe was declared a winner by disqualification over Andrew Golota of Poland. The police were called in and evacuated the arena. Minor injuries were reported and the authorities maintained a tight security around the Garden hours after the fight ended. Sports. [B9.]
 
Search for Missing Girl
They were surreal scenes: the lawyers at Lollapalooza, the bankers talking to bouncers, the middle-aged accountant interviewing a child with green spiked hair. They came in their jackets and ties bearing fliers and an urgent question: Has anybody seen a girl named Missy? They were all searching for Melissa Gay, 14, who left her parent's Connecticut home Saturday, took a train ride to New York, and apparently disappeared into the underground world of rave parties. [B3.]
 
Drug Dealer Sought in Deaths
While detectives searched for a convicted drug dealer in the killings of three Queens women, police officials said the slayings were motivated by a $50 drug debt. The police identified the suspect as Allan James Gordon, 24, who lives across the street from where the victims were killed. [B3.]
 
Beating Victim Returns Home
Shane L. Daniels, 21, who was beaten into a coma in May during a fight involving a New York City police officer outside a Long Island bar, spent his first full day back home. [B6.]
 
ABC Carpet and Home is not welcome on Long Island's affluent East End. [B6.]
 
REGION
 
Schools Could Get Millions
Seeking the largest Federal role ever in repairing public schools, President Clinton announced that he would ask Congress for $5 billion for the repairs. One official said that New York, where many schools still burn coal for heat, could expect as much as $400 million to $500 million. National report. [A12.]
 
NEW JERSEY
 
Police Force Disbanded
The Hudson County Board of Freeholders said it had no choice, but when it voted to disband the county's 82-officer Police Department, the officers who packed the meeting room said they had been betrayed. [B5.]

HEADLINE: NYC;
Netanyahu: U.S. Style, Israeli Content

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
ABOUT a year ago, Benjamin Netanyahu was fast-walking on a leafy street in Jerusalem when he bumped into someone who lived there, a man he had met many times before. When the man expressed surprise, Mr. Netanyahu, who was then Israel's opposition leader, explained that he had just moved into the neighborhood.
What street, he was asked. He pointed vaguely somewhere over yonder. Still curious, the acquaintance asked for specifics. Again, Mr. Netanyahu gave an elliptical response, muttering something about security concerns. 
 Now, this particular acquaintance never thought of himself as much of a terrorist threat, and in fact this minor episode probably had nothing to do with security. It was, however, a reminder of something about Israel's new Prime Minister that is often lost in the American-style politicking that he has mastered so well:
He does not like to reveal much about himself.
That may sound surprising, since he seems thoroughly American, down to the smooth public style he has shown to advantage this week. Don't let that fool you. Unlike American politicians, he is not a product of the Age of Oprah, ready to natter on about his childhood and how it shaped him.
All that is fine. Trouble begins, though, when you realize that getting Mr. Netanyahu to fill in the details of his national policies, articulated thus far only in broad outlines, can be as doomed to failure as trying to find out where he lives.
FAMILIAR though his face may have been, Mr. Netanyahu was still something of an enigma to the leaders of major Jewish groups who gathered at the Sheraton New York Hotel yesterday to welcome him for the first time as Prime Minister to this city that has more Jews than Jerusalem and Tel Aviv combined.
Whenever you talk about Israel's relations with American Jewry, you really mean the Jerusalem-New York nexus. It is a powerful bond, forged from a common faith and history, and it stayed firm yesterday. The new Israeli leader strode into a packed room to applause -- more polite, though, than exuberant -- from officials of groups ranging politically from right to left and religiously from Orthodox to nonobservant.
There were no surprises. Mainstream Jewish groups, as a matter of both principle and self-interest, line up behind the Israeli Prime Minister, no matter who he is. But questions put by these officials to Mr. Netanyahu, about central issues like his intentions toward the Palestinians and his ideas on religious pluralism, left them no more informed than when they came in. Many agreed that his responses, while stylishly delivered, came in familiar, generalized terms.
Then again, their opinions may count for the Prime Minister only up to a point. That is certainly the case with many ordinary Israelis, who increasingly have come to the conclusion that the American Jewish experience bears little relevance to their own.
Yes, they remain brothers and sisters, and Israelis will no doubt always value the clout that American Jews have in Washington and in the national news media. But spend much time worrying about how Israeli policies are playing in Forest Hills or on the Upper West Side? Not very likely.
ISRAEL'S President, Ezer Weizman, could not be more blunt about it. Over and over, he tells American Jews who call on him to forget about being a vital part of their people's future as long as they live in the Jewish diaspora.
It is not lost on Israelis that when Palestinian terrorist bombs started to explode in 1994, the first to cancel flights to Tel Aviv -- in droves -- were American Jewish tourists. As for the millions of dollars raised for Israeli institutions by American groups, many based in New York, money indeed can't buy love, especially since those dollars account for an ever-shrinking share of Israel's thriving economy. Some Israeli officials have gone so far as tell American Jews to keep their money -- and their opinions.
Left unchanged on Mr. Netanyahu's first day in town was an awareness among many Jews whose hearts are in both New York and Jerusalem that their relationship with Israel has entered a new, uncertain stage in the last few years. To a degree, so has their self-identity.
"We've sort of gotten past the idea of identifying ourselves just by how much money we contribute to Israel," Gary Rosenblatt, the thoughtful editor of The Jewish Week, told a group of fund-raisers recently. "But we haven't gotten to the next step. We're still floundering around trying to determine what it is."

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Fell in June; Producer Prices Up Slightly

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Retail sales fell in June, while producer prices rose modestly last month, the Government reported today, in two reports that eased some concerns about inflation and interest rates.
The Commerce Department said retail sales declined two-tenths of 1 percent, to $205.2 billion last month, as demand for everything from new cars to clothing waned after several months of strength. Sales had risen a brisk eight-tenths of 1 percent in May. 
 The Labor Department said the Producer Price Index edged up two-tenths of 1 percent in June, after a decline of one-tenth of 1 percent in May. Energy costs fell last month after rising earlier in the year, but food prices strengthened.
Excluding food and energy prices, which are often volatile, producer prices still rose two-tenths of 1 percent after being unchanged in May, the department said.
Producer prices are the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers.
"Prices are still very well behaved," said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company.
Coming a week after an employment report for June showed unexpected strength in the economy, today's reports, which came in near expectations, helped calm some of the fears raised by the jobs data. The two reports, especially the sales data, suggested that growth might not be as robust as previously believed.
The data on retail sales and producer prices helped bolster bond prices today.
The stock and bond markets have been sharply weaker since last Friday, in large part because investors fear that signs that the economy is picking up speed will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner -- and more sharply -- than has been expected.
Indeed, some investors have speculated that Fed policy makers will take the unusual step of raising rates before their next meeting on Aug. 20.
"The producer price report provides the Fed no leverage whatsoever for raising interest rates at this time," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.
The drop in June retail sales follows strong gains earlier this year and could point to slower growth in the second half as consumers spend less, analysts said. Most analysts said the economy grew strongly in the second quarter.
"This number shows us the consumer is not Superman, that there is some vulnerability here," said Christopher Low, a senior economist with HSBC Markets. "This weakness comes just at the right moment and the likelihood of a Fed move in the near future has been diminished."
Michelle Laughlin, chief economist at Sanwa Securities USA Inc., said, "The inflation data is not so bad as to suggest the Fed needs to move sooner and at the same time the retail sales data weren't so weak as to suggest the Fed will not move at all."
In its report, the Commerce Department said that excluding autos, sales rose one-tenth of 1 percent in June after a rise of five-tenths of 1 percent in May.
Sales of new cars fell 1.4 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted $49.7 billion, after rising 1.8 percent in May. New cars account for nearly a quarter of total retail sales.
Sales at general merchandise stores fell four-tenths of 1 percent after a 1.2 percent rise in May. Sales at clothing stores dropped 1.3 percent after increasing nine-tenths of 1 percent in May.
The Labor Department said energy prices fell 2.1 percent last month as gasoline dropped 7.4 percent and heating oil 11.4 percent.
Energy prices over all fell six-tenths of 1 percent in May.
Food prices partly offset the drop in energy prices, rising 1.6 percent after being unchanged in May.
Passenger car prices jumped 1 percent after increasing three-tenths of 1 percent the previous month.

HEADLINE: Elation, and Deflation, Over AIDS

 BODY:
It is hard not to feel a surge of elation at the rapid progress reported at the international AIDS conference in Vancouver this week. For the first time since the early days of the epidemic, scientists seem actually to be gaining ground in treating a viral menace that has been largely incurable and almost invariably fatal.
The most startling advances have come in drug treatments. Where once there was essentially one major drug, AZT -- moderately effective in slowing AIDS but highly toxic -- now there is an array of drugs in the same family as AZT and a whole new family of drugs that act through a different mechanism. By combining these drugs artfully, doctors have achieved astonishing results in suppressing the AIDS virus in small numbers of patients for limited periods of time. In perhaps the most dramatic result, the virus became undetectable for up to 300 days after participants took a three-drug combination. 
 Nobody knows for sure that the new treatments will work over the long term. They can cause severe side effects, like kidney stones and nausea, and many patients will no doubt find it extremely difficult to take more than 15 pills a day indefinitely, often on an empty stomach and at precise times. It also remains possible that the wily AIDS virus will eventually develop resistance to these currently potent drug cocktails, especially if many patients fail to take their medicines in the strict regimen required. AIDS doctors are rightly trying to dampen the initial hype and optimism over the treatment gains pending bigger and longer clinical trials. There is concern that the new developments may fizzle out as so many others have in the long, gloomy history of AIDS.
But even after all the caveats, it is hard to minimize the dramatic shift in thinking that has occurred. Whereas AIDS victims in the past have faced a dreary prospect of decline toward eventual death, now there is an emerging possibility that those who have access to the new drugs can suppress their infection and live with it as a lifelong, chronic ailment, much like herpes or diabetes. No one is predicting a total cure yet, but when the first subject with no detectable virus is finally taken off drugs, doctors will be watching anxiously to see whether the virus rebounds -- or has been eliminated for good.
The paradox is that, even if the new treatments pan out, the outlook for controlling the global AIDS epidemic remains grim. The treatments are expensive, ranging above $15,000 a year, and thus will be difficult to provide to all those who might benefit in the United States. The cost of providing these treatments in developing countries, where some 90 percent of those infected with the AIDS virus live, is likely to be prohibitive. The only sensible response is better prevention programs and, most important of all, an effective vaccine to protect against infection. That is the goal toward which AIDS researchers must now focus their energies.

HEADLINE: If U Cn Rd This . . .

BYLINE: By Tamara Plakins Thornton; Tamara Plakins Thornton, an associate professor of history at the State University of New York at Buffalo, is author of a forthcoming cultural history of handwriting.

 BODY:
The conventional wisdom these days is that the art of penmanship is vanishing and that the culprit is electronic. As a Michigan teacher recently told The Chicago Tribune, "Handwriting has taken a big beating because of computers and keyboards."
But this is hardly the first time warnings have been sounded about sloppy penmanship. A hundred years ago, it was the typewriter that was spelling the death of cursive. At issue today, as it was 100 years ago, is a fear of modern technology, and a yearning for a simpler past. 
 Early in the century, educators concerned about the reduced emphasis on penmanship and the introduction of typing into the curriculum came up with a novel way of fighting back. The then popular Palmer method of shaping letters promised to meet the typewriter on its own terms by turning the arm into a perpetual motion machine. But the hand was no match for a Remington.
By the 1950's, the alleged decline of handwriting had become something of a national obsession. Penmanship jeremiads appeared by the dozens in educational periodicals and popular magazines. Our "increasing reliance on the telephone, typewriter, dictating machines and electronic brains," commented The Saturday Evening Post in 1955, "would seem to be making handwriting as obsolete as smoke signals."
The cold war had increased American paranoia. Our weakened moral fiber, moralists argued, would make us less able to withstand a foreign aggressor. We had been too permissive. Among other things, we had allowed schoolchildren to avoid the hard work of learning proper handwriting.
By the mid-'60's, America had become worried not only about moral laxity but economic competitiveness as well. Penmanship advocates pointed to the economic costs of illegible inventory lists, sales receipts, packing slips and the like. In 1965, a story in The Pittsburgh Press blamed an engineer's scrawled instructions for a NASA failure.
The championing of self-expression and individuality prevalent in the late 1960's and 1970's prompted plenty of complaints about lack of discipline among the nation's youth, and even some nostalgia for the authority of the long-lapsed Palmer method. As two Palmer-trained pedagogues commented in 1975: "Children are rarely made to do anything in school any more. They have freedom of choice, which is good, but given freedom of choice, who among us would elect the dullness and repetition which characterized the penmanship of yore?"
For these educators, what needed to be recovered was not so much the penmanship lessons of yore as yore itself.
In 1991, when Phil Donahue recalled "the law and order of Catholic school in the 40's" and "the absolutes that enabled us to sleep so well in childhood," he chose the Palmer method to symbolize the comforting certainties of his youth.
"Your penmanship," he wrote in a newspaper essay addressing his teacher, Sister Mary Andrew, was "the excellent standard to which we all aspired." But as Mr. Donahue confessed, he had long since strayed from that model: "This small sin of the flesh is just one reminder of the many shortfalls between doing what you said and doing what I do. My adult life has been, like my penmanship, sliding backward."
Some are drawn to old-fashioned cursive as an antidote to the impersonal nature of the modern world. "It was like a little time capsule," is the way one writer for The Denver Post described a handwritten letter, "friendlier than a letter dashed off a computer. It was a real letter -- the kind people don't have time to write anymore."
In St. Cloud, Minn., a company called Written by Hand employs 150 workers to pen thousands of handwritten appeals for charity. Ballpoint pens are used because they are messy; smudges are seen as a personal touch.
So the ultimate goal of all the hand-wringing over handwriting is not legibility, and never has been. The real motive is to remember a time when rules were rules and people followed them, when machines were just machines and people ruled them. Instead of lamenting the sad fate of cursive, we would do better to think about why it matters so much to us in the first place.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Gets Big I.M.F. Credit, Backing Market Reforms

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Venezuela was awarded a $1.4 billion credit from the International Monetary Fund yesterday, a distinction that also serves as a seal of approval on the country's economic reform package.
Venezuela's plans to create an open, market-oriented economy, free of the stifling controls and regulations that once characterized virtually all the countries of Latin America, were introduced there in April by the Government of President Rafael Caldera. 
 Announcing the loan, the I.M.F. spoke approvingly of Venezuela's "ambitious and front-loaded economic program." It said the program was designed to redress a dismal economic situation in this potentially rich oil-producing country, which has suffered slow growth, 57 percent inflation, a big budget deficit and difficulties in the banking sector.
Under the new program, Venezuela has already lifted price controls on all goods except medicine as well as controls on currency flows in and out of the country and on interest rates. It is now committed to cutting public spending steeply, strengthening its banks and selling off state-owned telecommunications, aluminum, steel, electrical and petrochemical plants.
But the Government will also seek to protect the living standards of the country's 2 million poorest families from the impact of its austerity measures by giving them additional subsidies with help from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, the Monetary Fund said.
"All the countries of the region with the exception of Cuba and Haiti are going after what's known as the Washington consensus on economic policy," said Michael Hood, an analyst at J. P. Morgan in New York who specializes in Latin America.
The Venezuelan Finance Minister, Luis Raul Matos Azocar, said, "We are all moving in the same direction now." He spoke at a meeting of New York bankers on Thursday at which he previewed the accord with the Monetary Fund and explained his plans for liberalizing Venezuela's economy.
"We do not really need the I.M.F.'s money because our reserves are strong," Mr. Matos said. "But we want the I.M.F.'s stamp of approval to bolster international confidence in Venezuela."
Since the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980's, the countries of the region have been moving hesitatingly and with varying degrees of enthusiasm away from the closed, regulated economic systems they created in the 1950's and 1960's under the influence of economists like the late Raoul Prebish of Argentina.
Mr. Prebish and his followers had advocated a policy of economic self-sufficency under which these countries tried to build their own manufacturing industries by excluding imported goods, relying on exports of raw materials to earn foreign exchange.
But collapsing commodity prices in the 1980's left Latin America unable to service the big foreign debts it ran up to finance this dash for self-sufficency. And as they were forced to seek assistance from the Monetary Fund, the countries of the region have found themselves under growing pressure from the institution, as well as from successive American administrations, to make their economies more open and market-oriented.
The new trend began in Chile under the military Government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who in 1976 set his country firmly on the road toward economic liberalism, advised by economists of the so-called Chicago School who preached the benefits of free trade, deregulation and open competition.
Bolivia took the same path in 1985 with a series of economic reforms that lead to a loan agreement with the Monetary Fund in 1986. Mexico followed suit that same year.
But while Argentina and Brazil also tried to liberalize their economies during the 1980's, Monetary Fund officials say the efforts were half-hearted and the results disappointing.
In Argentina serious economic change only began in 1991 under President Carlos Saul Menem, while in Brazil it did not start until 1994, when Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was then Finance Minister and is now President, started fighting the country's run-away inflation, though without accepting any I.M.F. supervision over the economy.
In addition to today's loan agreement with Venezuela, the Monetary Fund now has accords with 11 other Latin American countries that offer them credits provided they liberalize their economies according to an agreed schedule. They are Argentina, Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Panama, Uruguay, Peru, Bolivia, Honduras, Guyana and Nicaragua.

HEADLINE: Alex Manoogian, 95; Perfected Design of Single-Handled Faucet

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Alex Manoogian, the Armenian immigrant responsible for making the single-handled faucet a ubiquitous fixture in modern bathrooms and kitchens throughout the United States and around the world, died on Wednesday at St. John Hospital in Detroit. Mr. Manoogian, who lived in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich., was 95.
Thanks to his realization of the promise of the ball valve joint patented by three inventors, Mr. Manoogian, who came to the United States from Turkey as a teen-ager in 1920, amassed a fortune. He proceeded to dispense it by donating millions of dollars to religious, educational, charitable and cultural institutions and hospitals -- many of them serving the Armenian community -- in scores of countries in North and South America, Europe, the Middle East and Australia. 
 Mr. Manoogian, who founded a small but successful machine shop in Detroit called the Masco Screw Products Company, specializing in automobile parts, was approached in 1952 by the inventors of the ball valve joint, which was capable of making hot and cold water run from a single tap.
They were looking for someone to develop a faucet based on the valve at a time when there were virtually no single-handled faucets on the market.
"It appealed to me," Mr. Manoogian said later. "I said, 'Why wouldn't people want to do something with one hand instead of with two?' "
He signed an agreement with the inventors, and he put his shop to work. Two years later he had a faucet whose handle could be turned left or right for hot or cold water and be pushed or pulled to control the volume. And the faucet was dripless, having no washers to wear out.
Although Mr. Manoogian was intrigued by manufacturing the single-handled faucet, his interest in selling it was minimal. But when plumbing companies told him there was no market for such a fixture, Mr. Manoogian felt he had no choice but to market it himself.
Last year the Masco Corporation, based in the Detroit suburb of Taylor, realized sales of $3 billion from home furnishing and building products, including plumbing and brass goods, kitchen cabinets, appliances, spas and locks manufactured in 100 factories in 15 countries.
The faucets, marketed under such names as Delta, Peerless and Sherle Wagner, are made in single- and double-handled models that range in price from about $40 for a relatively simple chrome fixtures for do-it-yourselfers to thousands of dollars for top-of-the line models made from precious metals. The faucets account for $698 million, or 23 percent of the company's total sales, and the company says its products hold 38 percent of the domestic market for faucets.
Stock in Masco, which barely survived the Depression, was first sold to the public in 1936 for $1 a share. A year later it was listed for sale on the Detroit Stock Exchange, and Masco shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1969. Masco officials calculate that a $10,000 investment in the stock in 1958 would be worth $25 million today.
Mr. Manoogian, a somewhat shy Old World figure who spoke in lightly accented English, was widely regarded as one of the most prominent persons of Armenian descent in the world. For 36 years he was the international president of the Armenian General Benevolent Union, a worldwide educational, cultural and humanitarian organization. In 1970 he was elected life president, and in 1989 honorary life president.
In such countries as Argentina, Australia, Canada, Iran, Israel, the Netherlands and the United States, institutions created or assisted by Mr. Manoogian's generosity were named for him, his wife, the former Marie Tatian, who died in 1992 after 61 years of marriage, or his parents, Tacvor and Tacoohie Manoogian.
Mr. Manoogian donated the home he had once lived in to the City of Detroit, which uses it as the official residence of its mayor.
In 1990 he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, a special award to outstanding Americans, and last year the Republic of Armenia awarded him its National Hero Medal and declared him an Armenian citizen, the first individual outside the country to be so honored.
Mr. Manoogian was born in 1901 in Smyrna, now Izmir, Turkey. The collapse of the Ottoman Empire in World War I promoted so much economic chaos and political repression for Armenians in Turkey that he left in 1920 for the United States, where he was later joined by his parents, two brothers and two sisters.
Mr. Manoogian settled first in Bridgeport, Conn., where he worked in a factory and taught Armenian in evening courses for adults. In 1924 he moved to Detroit, where, as a skilled machinist, he founded Masco Screw Products in 1929.
He is survived by a son, Richard A. Manoogian of Grosse Pointe, Mich., now chairman and chief executive of Masco; a daughter, Louise Simone of Manhattan, who succeeded her father as president of the Armenian General Benevolent Union; six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

Bonds Extend Price Gains To a 4th Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rose yesterday for a fourth consecutive session after reports on producer prices and retail sales eased worries that the Federal Reserve would quickly raise interest rates.
The data on producer prices and retail sales in June suggested that economic growth might not be quite as robust as had been indicated in last Friday's surprisingly strong report on June employment. Treasury prices were also bolstered by a rally in the Treasury futures market. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32 , to 879/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 7.03 percent, from 7.05 percent on Thursday.
Shorter maturities, however, finished slightly lower, as investors looked ahead to what could be a volatile week, with fresh data on consumer prices and industrial production and Congressional testimony from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Early losses in bonds were erased after the Commerce Department said retail sales fell two-tenths of 1 percent, to $205.2 billion in June. Excluding autos, sales rose one-tenth of 1 percent.
Retail sales were soft, "but one month doesn't make a trend." said Carl Palash, chief economist at MCM Moneywatch in New York.
Jack Ablin, director of fixed income and senior fund manager at the Private Bank at the Bank of Boston, said, "Retail sales were positive for the market, showing a large down move after a huge increase the month before."
The Labor Department reported the Producer Price Index edged up two-tenths of 1 percent in June. While the index was at the high end of expectations, Mr. Palash said, a decline in the costs of materials showed no price pressures in the manufacturing pipeline.
Mr. Ablin said he saw yesterday's data as noninflationary.
In addition, bond prices were bolstered by a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, whose index of regional business activity showed a drop to 7.7 in June from 11.6 in May.
Mr. Palash said the economic data weighed the possibility of a moderation in growth ahead and also showed that inflation was well contained.
"The data," he said, "were neutral with respect to Fed policy and not weak enough to close the door on a Fed tightening, nor strong enough to make certain a tightening immediately ahead."
Anthony Chan, chief economist at the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, said: "Although today's rally was quite impressive, one has to be careful in realizing that market sentiment will continue to remain volatile until Mr. Greenspan lays out his real objectives next Thursday in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before the Senate Banking Committee."
In the Treasury futures market, the September bond contract settled at a price of 10813/32 , after opening at 10718/32.

HEADLINE: For an Exclusive With Netanyahu, Just Get in Line

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD 

 BODY:
He made his debut as the celebrity spokesman for WINS radio's traffic reports. He served as the utility "exclusive interview" of the day. He facilitated the distribution of ice cream coupons. And, figuring "Why not?" on a summer Friday afternoon, he went to the movies.
It was a catch-all type of day for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel yesterday, as he continued his orchestrated campaign to charm, pacify, stimulate and otherwise enrapture a city he dearly wants to count as an ally in his new administration. 
 If plugging a radio station helped, so be it. If the public wants money-saving ice cream coupons, let them have them.
And, hey, even he needs an entertainment break.
On the second day of his three-day visit to New York, Mr. Netanyahu hewed to a less geographically ambitious schedule than he did on Thursday, when he journeyed indefatigably around the city and addressed sizable public assemblages. Yet he was probably no less effective in getting mileage for his message of a tough stance on Middle East peace combined with economic reform.
WINS radio found itself blessed that, in an early-morning interview with the station, the Prime Minister thoughtfully applauded its traffic reports for helping him avoid road congestion during his days as Israel's delegate to the United Nations. WINS was unable to resist playing the plug repeatedly during commercial interludes all day long.
Throughout a schedule somewhat less punishing than Thursday's had been for his aides and security detail, the Prime Minister chose to remain inside the Stanhope Hotel on Fifth Avenue and 81st Street for the greater part of the day, devoting the morning to obliging the news media with sound bites and sitting for two sessions with groups of journalists. Most of the afternoon was taken up by a procession of reunions with American friends.
And so he was heard as an "exclusive" interview on both Fox's "Good Morning New York" and on WCBS radio. He went before the cameras with Bill Beutel as well as Gabe Pressman, in each case saying essentially the same things he had been repeating for days in nonexclusive settings: He would insist on security for Israel in Middle East peace talks, Jerusalem would never be divided and Israel's economy was poised for phenomenal growth.
Over the $20 hotel breakfast with some 40 American journalists (including Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters and Dan Rather), the Prime Minister, brimming with self-confidence, skillfully navigated 45 minutes of questions, scrupulously careful not to make headlines, but graceful in his evasions.
He again sounded the principal themes of the trip: the continuation of the peace process and Israel's business potential now that a market-oriented party is in power. He gently rebuked the United States for not pushing Syria harder toward peace, and declared, "I am prepared to negotiate with Syria without preconditions right now."
He was occasionally funny, in an American-referential way. When he was asked about President Clinton, he deftly ducked mention of their areas of disagreement and praised Mr. Clinton's detailed knowledge of Middle East issues, saying, "He didn't hold up three-by-five cards."
He followed the breakfast meeting with a session with about 20 journalists from Jewish publications.
Mr. Netanyahu gave over the greater portion of yesterday to catching up with some of his many friends and associates from 16 years in the United States, especially his tenure as a delegate to the United Nations in the 1980's.
Those who came calling at the Stanhope included a strikingly diverse assortment of the known and the unknown. One moment it was City Comptroller Alan Hevesi (who discussed the possibility of investing money from the city's pension funds in Israel) and the next it was Rabbi Elimelech Naiman from Brooklyn. One moment it was Laurence Tisch, the wealthy New York businessman and former CBS chairman, and the next it was Rose Mattus, an old friend who is the president of the Mattus Ice Cream Company of Fort Lee, N.J.
As she was leaving, Ms. Mattus gleefully distributed ice cream coupons outside the hotel to anyone who wanted one. Those who did included photographers, security agents and those merely lucky to be passing by. They were good for 50 cents off on Monterey Sorbet or Mattus Original Vanilla.
Late in the afternoon, the Netanyahus, under a solemn cloak of secrecy, went to the movies. They watched a private advance screening of "A Time to Kill," the upcoming thriller based on a John Grisham novel. With them were Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time Warner, the actor Richard Gere and Ehud Olmert, the Mayor of Jerusalem.
All in all, many Jewish leaders who heard Mr. Netanyahu felt he had performed well in this first visit as Prime Minister.
"While he did not reveal any new positions, at least publicly, I think his knowledge of English, his understanding of America and his quite exceptional communications skills created a quite attractive package that I think softened the edges that many of the skeptics have been focusing on," said David A. Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish Committee. "I think what he's accomplished is he's bought some breathing space until the rash judgments are made."
Today, Mr. Netanyahu plans to attend Sabbath services at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, the synagogue he worshiped at when he was at the U.N. and which is just four blocks from his hotel. Things may go a little slower than usual. The synagogue anticipates a crowd of some 1,000 worshipers, more than triple the normal turnout on a summer Saturday.
After the service, if the weather cooperates, his intention is to visit the Central Park Zoo with his wife, Sarah, and their two young sons. He flies back to Israel after sundown.

HEADLINE: Group Disputes G.O.P. Ad on Cost of Tax Increase

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
A central assertion in the Republicans' latest advertisement attacking President Clinton -- that the typical family's Federal tax bill has increased $1,500 under Mr. Clinton -- has been disputed by the nonpartisan organization that the party cited as the source of the information.
The group, the Tax Foundation, said on Thursday that the Republican National Committee advertisement on behalf of Bob Dole's Presidential campaign was "misleading" because it failed to reflect that the increased tax bill resulted largely from economic growth that produced increases in family income. 
 "It surprises and disturbs us," said Stephen Gold, the communications director of the Washington foundation.
The Republican committee had cited a 1995 Tax Foundation report to back up its assertion that, "Under Clinton, the typical American family now pays over $1,500 more in Federal taxes." The commercial did not note that during the same period, median family income increased $6,260 to $52,039 from $45,779 in 1992.
Mr. Gold said his organization had complained to Mr. Dole's campaign that while the $1,500 figure "is technically correct, people need to know more about the figure."
"Most of it really does come from economic growth," Mr. Gold said. "They're not giving credit to the Clinton Administration for higher income, but they're giving it blame for the higher taxes."
Mr. Gold said that by his organization's calculation, the real increase in taxes, adjusted for inflation and increase in income, was about $300.
A Republican Party spokesman, Mary Crawford, said campaign officials believed that the advertisement was not unfair to the Tax Foundation.
"It's their study," Ms. Crawford said, adding that she did not share Mr. Gold's concern about the omission of the income figures. "We don't have to say that."

HEADLINE: After Selloff, Stocks Drop But Only a Bit

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Many investors waded back into the stock market with caution yesterday, stemming two days of heavy price declines, which had led many analysts to wonder if the long bull market on Wall Street was coming to a close.
The Nasdaq composite index, which has fallen nearly 12 percent since its high on June 5, closed the day at 1,103.49, down 2.87 points. The Dow Jones industrial average, which includes larger, more established companies, fell 9.98 points to close at 5,510.56. It has declined nearly 5 percent since reaching a peak in late May. 
 The day's trading, while hardly spectacular, provided bulls with evidence that the selloff earlier in the week was not as dire as many bears had been portraying it.
"What basically happened was that investors got off the sidelines," said Abby Joseph Cohen, a strategist and self-described market bull at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "I think over the last few days investors were in shock."
But it was clear that many investors were still nervous. While bargain hunters snapped up many technology stocks, which had plunged after unexpectedly bad news from stalwarts like Motorola and Hewlett-Packard on Tuesday and Wednesday, there were still more sellers than buyers.
Hewlett-Packard was down 1/4, closing at 78 1/8 yesterday, having dropped 15 percent for the week. Motorola was also down, closing at 55 3/4, down 1/8. Digital Equipment, I.B.M. and Compaq Computer also lost ground.
The big gainers yesterday were oil equipment stocks, which have enjoyed a strong rally recently, along with natural gas producers and health stocks, which bounced back after a warning of disappointing earnings from United Healthcare on Thursday sent them reeling along with the technology sector. Yesterday, United Healthcare rose 2 1/8, to 33 1/8.
The Nasdaq market was helped by a rise in shares of Intel, which announced that in a break with recent tradition it would not be cutting prices on its microprocessors later this year. Many analysts saw this as evidence that Intel was confident that demand for personal computers would remain strong.
"The session started out with a better tone, but most stocks still seem for sale," said Timothy G. Grazioso, manager of Nasdaq trading at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. "If it had opened with a handful of bad news it would have been a lot less orderly."
As it was, Nasdaq's two biggest technology plays -- Intel and Microsoft -- went in opposite directions. Intel rose 1 3/4 to close at 71 1/4, while Microsoft fell 2 1/8, to 112 3/8.
Mr. Grazioso attributed Microsoft's decline to profit taking. "That is an example of a stock that everybody has had a profit in over the last six months, so they can take some money off the table," he said.
To some analysts, investor worries were apparent in yesterday's reaction to unexpectedly strong earnings from Chrysler. By many accounts, auto stocks should have rallied on the news. Instead, the Big Three auto makers were down. Chrysler lost 1 1/4, to 56 1/4. General Motors dropped 1, to 48 1/4, and Ford Motor fell 3/8, to 30 3/4.
Chrysler's profit gains were seen as a last hurrah by investors, said Jack V. Kirnan, the auto industry analyst with Salomon Brothers. "They are saying: 'This is as good as it gets. All the good news is behind us not ahead of us,' " he said, referring to investor worries about increasing competition, a stronger dollar and the prospect of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
While Mr. Kirnan said he did not believe that such worries were yet justified for the car companies, David G. Shulman, the chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, echoed those sentiments about the market as a whole.
"I still think it is possible for the market to make a new high later in the year," he said, though he cautioned that any rally would be confined to larger, more established stocks, rather than the small companies that have caused the Nasdaq's rise in recent years.
"We've drawn blood," he said, referring to the Nasdaq's more recent plunge. The market has shown the population that they can lose money. It will be conservative from here."
Investors should know more next week, he added, when more economic statistics and corporate earnings, including those of Intel, will be issued, and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, will testify before Congress.
Ms. Cohen of Goldman, Sachs said she was even more optimistic. For investors to be worried about an overheated economy, as they were when the Government reported robust employment statistics a week ago Friday, and then to be concerned about weak corporate earnings, as they were this week, is a contradiction that cannot last, she said.
"At this point investors are not willing to pay for 1997 earnings because there is too much uncertainty in their minds," she added. "But over the coming months people will realize that the economy is growing enough to generate profits but not enough to generate excessive inflation."
She predicted that the S.& P. 500 index would reach between 690 and 700 by the end of the year. It closed yesterday at 646.
Earlier, stocks in Japan ended sharply lower. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed down 236.13 points, or 1.08 percent, at 21,656.45. For the week, the Nikkei was down 575.97 points. In London, the Financial Times Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares fell 20.7 points, or nearly six-tenths of 1 percent, at 3,728.3, a loss of 14.9 points for the week.

HEADLINE: G.A.O. Puts Cost of S.& L. Bailout at Half a Trillion Dollars

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
The General Accounting Office today released the most comprehensive Government study so far on the costs of the savings and loan bailout, placing a total price tag on the debacle of nearly half a trillion dollars, including more than $130 billion from taxpayers.
The figures were roughly in line with previous estimates, and included both direct and indirect costs as well as interest payments that will stretch out for decades. 
 The money went to clean up the financial mess from the failure of more than 700 savings institutions in the 1980's and early 1990's as a result of mismanagement, fraud and an economic downturn in states like Texas and California.
"The bad news in this report is that the cost of the failure of many thrift institutions, with interest, approaches half a trillion dollars and that taxpayer accountability due to bonds issued will continue through the year 2030," said Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, a Republican who is the chairman of the House Banking Committee.
"The good news is that America's financial institutions today are stronger and sounder than in many years, that the bank and savings and loan insurance funds are positively capitalized and that prudent regulation is in place," Mr. Leach said.
The G.A.O., which functions as a financial watchdog for Congress, said the total bill included $87.9 billion spent by the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency set up by Congress in 1989 to sell the assets of failed institutions, and $64.7 billion spent by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which guaranteed deposits.
It also included $7.5 billion in tax benefits granted to healthy savings institutions that acquired ailing savings and loans. Interest expenses included $111.8 billion on two bond issues, and $209 billion in interest on Congressional appropriations.
For all the money thrown at the problem, the books are not yet closed. The Supreme Court ruled this month that the Government could be liable for billions of dollars in damages for arbitrarily changing a set of accounting rules, hurting or forcing out of business dozens of institutions that had agreed to acquire failing savings associations.
Moreover, the current Savings Association Insurance Fund remains badly undercapitalized, and the banking and savings industries are feuding over who should pay to bring it up to a prudent level and also finance interest payments on bonds issued to pay for the cleanup.

HEADLINE: Traverse City Journal;
Utility Customers Put a Premium on Wind Energy

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER 

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., July 12

 BODY:
This time of year, the fields on the high bluff west of Traverse City begin to yield all sorts of crops: cherries, peaches, cucumbers and corn. Seven weeks ago, though, Terry Lautner's alfalfa field sprouted something the neighbors are still talking about: a giant windmill to generate electricity.
But it is not just the windmill's enormous spinning blades or its prodigious size -- it is the nation's largest -- that has people in this upper Great Lakes community buzzing. It is also how it was financed. Traverse City Light and Power, a city-owned utility, readily persuaded 145 families and 20 businesses to agree to pay 20 percent more for their electricity -- an average of $7.58 a month -- to gain a clean source of energy. It is the first time, energy industry experts say, that an electric windmill has been built in the United States by charging utility customers a premium, or green, rate. 
 "I've always been interested in tapping the wind energy in that field," said Mr. Lautner, a 39-year-old dairy farmer whose family has tilled the fields here since 1865. "It's real neat. I became so interested I killed a day watching them put it up when I should have been planting corn."
If there is a place where some people would gladly pay a little more for a cleaner source of power, it is here in northwestern Michigan. While the Traverse region is politically conservative, it is also developing a reputation as one of the most innovative areas in the Great Lakes basin for trying ideas that join environmental and economic goals.
Two years ago, for example, residents of nearby Old Mission Peninsula voted to increase their property taxes to raise at least $2.6 million. That extra revenue, generated in the teeth of national anti-tax sentiment, is being used to protect thousands of acres of scenic orchards and cultivated fields by paying farmers not to develop their land.
"It really wasn't hard to attract customers to the program," said Steven B. Smiley, an energy economist here who guided the windmill project. "We wrote a letter to all of Traverse City Light and Power's customers in June 1994 and told them it would cost a little more each month to put up a windmill. Within a few weeks, we had more customers than we ended up needing."
There was a brief period, in the late 1970's and early 80's, when wind power seemed to be a promising alternative to conventional power sources like oil. Under the Carter Administration, tax credits were established to encourage innovators. The Reagan Administration ended the Federal tax credit in 1985, and the domestic industry began to decline.
The snow-white machine here, erected at a cost of $670,000, is a Danish-built Vestas V-44 600. Its rotors are 144 feet long and spin at 28 revolutions per minute, fast enough for the blades to slice through the air at 145 m.p.h.
The bluff where the machine stands is buffeted by winds from Lake Michigan that average 14.5 m.p.h. The utility expects that its windmill will generate 1.2 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year, roughly what is needed to supply 200 homes in Traverse City.
The windmill, which turns with a gentle whoosh like the sound of the summer breeze in a screen, is a monument to the vision and perseverance of Mr. Smiley, who first introduced the idea to local utility executives in 1989.
Mr. Smiley said that at a cost of 7 cents a kilowatt hour, the windmill produces the lowest-priced electricity of just about any new power source. But it cannot compete with coal-fired power plants whose costs have been amortized over decades.
As a result, Traverse City Light and Power produces and buys electricity for less than 3 cents a kilowatt hour. The utility's executives assured Mr. Smiley that they would support a windmill if he could come up with a means for making up the difference. So he did.
As part of its energy policy, the Bush Administration enacted a tax credit in the early 1990's that is now worth 1.6 cents a kilowatt hour. At Mr. Smiley's urging, the Michigan Public Utility Commission awarded Traverse City Light and Power a $50,000 grant. Mr. Smiley calculated that customers interested in supporting the windmill would have to pay 1.58 cents more per kilowatt hour. Some 263 of the utility's more than 8,000 customers signed green rate contracts; 80 are on a waiting list.
Ever since the windmill went up over Memorial Day weekend, the utility and Mr. Smiley have been receiving fan mail from across the country. Randy Udall, director of the Community Office for Resource Efficiency, a nonprofit advocacy group in Aspen, Colo., sent one of Mr. Smiley's favorites.
"Traverse City, we salute you," Mr. Udall wrote. "Taking energy decisions into your own hands. Putting money where your heart is. Cleaning the air. Saving fossil fuels for our grandkids. Why, that's almost un-American."

HEADLINE: A Boom With a Difference;
Oil Services Get More Savvy

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

DATELINE: LAFAYETTE, La.

 BODY:
Eight years ago, jobs in the oil-service industry were so scarce that a classified ad for a handful of openings drew hundreds of job seekers to the Global Marine Drilling Company parking lot by the time the manager, Bill Watson, arrived at 6 A.M.
"Some had slept in their cars all night," he recalled. One applicant looked so beaten down that Mr. Watson impulsively pulled a $20 bill from his wallet and handed it to him to tide him over until his next paycheck. 
 "There was that look of desperation," Mr. Watson said.
How times have changed. The same skilled rig workers who had to plead for work back then now have their pick of jobs. The man that Mr. Watson took pity on, Gary Dunn, who was once reduced to picking up soda cans along highways for the nickel deposit, now makes $3,200 a month and is building a new home in Tennessee.
He and thousands of other oilfield workers are the beneficiaries of a surprisingly strong recovery of the oil-services industry. And nowhere is the boom having a bigger impact than in southern Louisiana, studded with hundreds of companies that do everything from manufacturing drilling equipment to ferrying materials to oil platforms.
Statewide, employment in the sector has bounced back to 50,000 after experiencing a disastrous slide to 45,000 in 1993 from a peak of 95,000 jobs a decade earlier. The industry is running at full throttle, with an estimated 95 percent of all available rigs drilling for oil, up from a little over 60 percent early last year. The high demand has pushed the cost to oil companies of hiring a drilling platform in the Gulf of Mexico to an average of about $35,000 a day from a little over $20,000 a year ago, according to Jefferies & Company, an energy-research firm.
The engine powering this resurgence is technology. Improved methods of interpreting three-dimensional seismic readings have enabled oil companies to peer ever deeper under the waters of the gulf, and has sharply increased the success rate of their exploratory drilling. And the latest horizontal-drilling techniques have allowed the companies to squeeze more oil from old fields at low cost.
But it is not just technology that makes this oil boom different from the last one. The oil-service industry is much more hard-nosed, and much more sophisticated, than it was in the late 1970's and early 1980's, when oil prices were soaring and some market analysts were predicting they would hit $60 to $100 a barrel. Then, banks eager to get in on the action, loosened the credit lines to the point of soliciting anybody with an oil-rig lease to take out a loan.
Today, still smarting from being saddled with huge inventories of nearly worthless oil-drilling gear and other equipment they inherited from companies that went under, the same banks have shut off financing for any but the most cash-flush borrowers.
"Loans are made on one thing, and that's cash flow," said C. R. (Rusty) Cloutier, president of Mid-South National Bank, which got stuck with a lot of worthless collateral in 1986. "Property and lease rights don't help you very much now."
And while the banks' stinginess may be bad news for start-ups and struggling companies, it is probably good news for the oil industry as a whole because it damps the sort of speculative fervor that fuels the boom-and-bust cycle.
Indeed, the companies that survived the last downturn are a tough-minded bunch whose owners and managers figure they can make money even if the price of oil stays stuck in the range of $18 to $20 a barrel, which has prevailed for the last three years -- or even if the price falls.
"If we can get only $18 to $19 a barrel for the next three years we can make a profit," said James H. Prince , controller of Stone Energy in Lafayette, which has stepped up exploration and development of existing fields.
Rather than dream about quick profits, companies like Mr. Prince's subject themselves to painstaking analysis of everything from geological formations to the cost -- down to a few pennies a barrel -- of extracting oil in a given location. But they are not afraid to go against the common wisdom. William W. Rucks 4th, president of Flores & Rucks Inc. here, says his company has grown steadily since the late 1980's by buying old fields from such majors as the Shell Oil Company and using the latest technology to squeeze more oil out of them.
Mr. Rucks, 38, said rigorous financial oversight and cost-cutting had enabled Flores & Rucks to prosper. "People are very cautious this time around," he said. "You just hope the hard lessons are going to be remembered." Since his company went public at $10 a share in 1994, it has enjoyed a healthy cash flow and has raised more than $235 million from its initial and subsequent public offerings. Its stock has been trading recently in the $35 range.
While Flores & Rucks stock has done better than most, the oil-service industry has outperformed the market over the last year. In the first quarter of 1996, for example, shares of a group of companies followed by Jefferies & Company rose an average of 34 percent, compared with a gain of about 9 percent in the Dow Jones industrial average.
For all the toughness, oil-service companies in Louisiana are caught up in a hiring frenzy. With the departure of tens of thousands of oil workers during the lean years to other industries, often in other parts of the country, the search at times takes on a desperate air.
They are hanging huge "Now Hiring" signs outside their plants and filling local papers with display ads for workers. To retain workers, they are increasing wages for the first time in years, though their obsession with containing costs is keeping the raises modest. They are also gearing up to train new workers and are sending recruiters to campuses of technical colleges.
People who already hold jobs are working harder than ever. Mr. Watson, the Global Marine manager, puts in 12-hour days ordering thousands of items, from drill bits to pool tables, that must be shipped to inland drilling rigs and offshore production platforms. He is so busy, he says, that he can no longer snatch a few minutes to play a video game on his office computer. The office staff has multiplied so fast, to 30 people from 5 in two years, that he can't keep track of all the new faces. "I haven't played golf in two years," he lamented.
Makers of oil-exploration equipment say they have trouble meeting demand. Dailey J. Berard, president and chairman of Universal Fabricators Inc., stretched his arms in frustration in his office in New Iberia, La., at the thought of all the business he has to turn away -- $100 million in orders for drilling and production platforms last year and a projected $100 million again this year.
Even though Mr. Berard has tripled his work force over the last three years to 450 from 160, he is booked for major projects well into 1997. "We can't staff up for it fast enough," he said. "We can't find the skilled work force."
The workers they do find are sitting pretty. "There's jobs everywhere," said Huey J. Herbert, a 26-year-old pipe welder who works up to 80 hours a week.
Mr. Dunn, the man who accepted the $20 bill from Global Marine's Mr. Watson, has experienced a complete reversal of fortunes. For a time in the 1980's, with oil jobs impossible to find, he says, he and his wife, Sheila May, teetered on the brink of homelessness. The bank had foreclosed on their house, and they lived in their battered Nova, driving around southern Louisiana looking for ways to make a few dollars. Sometimes they would walk along the highway with plastic bags, collecting cans and bottles. Other times, they would knock on doors, offering to do household chores. "You'd say: 'I'll rake a yard for $10,' " said Mr. Dunn, who is now 42. "You would do anything to make ends meet."
Through it all, the couple -- who have two children -- held onto their pride. "We never asked for a handout," Mr. Dunn said. "I kept my good credit." Finally, the industry opened up and today Mr. Dunn is an assistant driller on a deep-water rig that is exploring for oil off West Africa. He works 12-hour days for one month, then takes home leave the following month. With his income approaching $40,000 a year, he and his wife recently decided to build a new home in Bradford, Tenn., near her parents.
For Lafayette, a city of 107,000, the oil-exploration boom is just icing on the cake of a recovery that has been under way for several years as local officials attracted industries ranging from apparel and jewelry manufacturing to food processing, and big retailers followed.
Driving his Ford Explorer along Pinhook Road, Gregg Gothreaux, president of the Lafayette Economic Development Authority, points with pride to the strip's economic rebirth. There is hardly a block that does not boast a new mega-store -- here a Home Depot emporium, there a Barnes & Noble bookstore, farther on a Super K-Mart grocery store.
State Route 90, the coastal road where most of the oil-service concerns have their headquarters, is also enjoying a renaissance. Just a few years ago, it was lined with empty corrugated-steel buildings, whose parking lots were overgrown with weeds. Now, new buildings are springing up. "We've already outgrown this," said Mickey McDonald, manager of a division of Hanover Compression, pointing to a large factory where workers assemble 1,000-horsepower gas compressors. To accommodate a work force that has grown to 59 from 9 in six years, Mr. McDonald plans to build a second plant next to this one and has his eye on a Mom-and-Pop outfit nearby.
Mr. McDonald is not embarking on an ill-considered, breakneck expansion. He is cautious in his hiring practices, for example, spending extra time to find skilled workers and then training them to make sure they handle his company's $700,000 machines properly.
Like many oil-service companies, Hanover is controlled by major players who are savvy about the market and unlikely to overextend themselves. Started in 1990 by a group of Houston investors who bought and consolidated three compressor-leasing companies, Hanover subsequently teamed up with two natural-gas giants, the Enron Corporation and Western Resources.
"The days of the little company are over," Mr. McDonald said.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Leadership Backs Out on a Bill To End Preferences

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 12

 BODY:
Amid continued criticism that their party is insensitive toward minorities and women, the House Republican leadership has withdrawn its support from a bill that would end all Federal affirmative-action programs. The move scuttles any chance that the measure will pass this year.
Instead, House Republican staff members and conservative civil rights advocates said, Republican lawmakers will concentrate on seeking to end programs that give preferences to "disadvantaged" companies in the awarding of contracts. In practice, the benefit has mainly gone to companies owned by members of racial minorities. 
 A bill to end such contract preferences will be taken up next week by the House Judiciary Committee. . That measure is a stripped-down version of one introduced last year by Representative Charles T. Canady, Republican of Florida, and by Bob Dole before he left the Senate, where he was the Republican leader, to campaign full time for President.
The original bill, the one the Republican leadership has now abandoned, would have prohibited the Federal Government from granting any preferences on the basis of race, color, national origin or sex in Federal employment, contracts and any other Federal programs. It would also have forbidden the Government to require or encourage affirmative action by Federal contractors.
The new bill would ban only preferences in awarding contracts.
The quiet abandonment of the broad-gauge attack on all Federal affirmative-action efforts, first reported in The Washington Times today, was a marked contrast to the way the bill was introduced last July. Mr. Canady and Mr. Dole announced their proposal at a crowded news conference where they criticized Government "discrimination."
But in the year since, the Dole-Canady bill, officially called the Equal Opportunity Act of 1996, has run into strong bipartisan opposition, a surprising development given the Republicans' control of Congress. Mr. Dole's affirmative-action stand has come under fire from some Republican moderates, like Gen. Colin L. Powell, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
"Republicans have been ambivalent from the beginning about Dole-Canady," a Republican staff member involved in the issue said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "So this is not a surprise."
The Dole-Canady bill also failed to gain the support of either of the black Republican Representatives in Congress, J. C. Watts of Oklahoma and Gary A. Franks of Connecticut.
"When you have both of your African-American members of Congress saying to the leadership that they should not proceed, I think that obviously puts them in a very difficult position," Mr. Franks said in an interview.
The change in strategy means that in this term, the Republicans will no longer oppose affirmative-action programs in employment, which have benefited white women to a much greater degree than members of racial minorities. Federal affirmative-action programs in awarding contracts, on the other hand, have disproportionately aided racial minorities.
Many Federal contracts that have been set aside for economically and socially disadvantaged companies are parceled out by the Small Business Administration under its 8(a) program. Of the 6,000 companies that participated in that S.B.A. program in the last fiscal year, only 32 were not owned by members of minorities.
"Contracting is black," a Democratic staff member involved in the issue said. "They have made the political judgment that they can't take on women."
It is unclear how comprehensive the attack on affirmative action in Federal contract programs will be. While the revised Dole-Canady bill would end affirmative action in the awarding of all Federal contracts, a bill being offered by Representative Jan Meyers, Republican of Kansas, would end only the S.B.A. program.
The small-business program, the largest such effort run by the Federal Government, awards contracts worth about $5.8 billion annually. Other large preference programs in contracting are run by the Defense Department and by the Transportation Department; smaller ones are administered by other Federal agencies.
Ms. Meyers and her staff say they have been given the impression by the House leadership that her bill will be given top priority as a substitute for the Dole-Canady measure.
"Mrs. Meyers's approach is a priority with the leadership at this point," one of her aides said. "Dole-Canady is on the back burner for further consideration."
An aide to Speaker Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, said today that while no decision had been made, the leadership was "leaning" toward throwing its full support behind Mrs. Meyers's bill.
The retreat of the House leadership has drawn a vitriolic response from Republican conservatives who say that opposition to affirmative action is both morally and politically right.
"On this issue, the Republican leadership has neither guts nor brains," said Clint Bolick, vice president of the Institute for Justice, an organization that opposes affirmative action.
"This is the Lilliputian approach to civil rights policy. The Republican leadership has consistently been terrified of this issue for unknown reasons."
Linda Chavez, head of the Center for Equal Opportunity, another conservative group that opposes affirmative action, said: "Lord knows why they are doing this. I think they are really stinging from the very successful ploy of painting the Congress as extremist. They want to be on the side of the angels."
But, Ms. Chavez added, "capitulation rarely works."

Retail Sales Fell in June; Producer Prices Edge Up
Retail sales fell in June, while producer prices rose modestly. The two Government reports eased some concerns about inflation and interest rates. Retail sales fell two-tenths of 1 percent, to $205.2 billion last month, as demand for everything from new cars to clothing waned after several months of strength. The Producer Price Index edged up two-tenths of 1 percent in June, after falling one-tenth of 1 percent in May. Energy costs fell last month, but those declines were offset by a rise in food prices. [Page 34.]
 
Treasury prices rose after reports on producer prices and retail sales eased worries that the Federal Reserve would quickly raise interest rates. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32 , to 879/32 . The bond's yield fell to 7.03 percent from 7.05 percent on Thursday. [44.]
 
New U.S. Plan on Data-Scrambling
Under pressure from Congress and the computer industry, the Clinton Administration proposed a series of new data-scrambling policy initiatives that it said would address the Government's national security concerns while also permitting American companies to compete more effectively overseas. [34.]
 
Intel Revamps Chip Pricing
Intel is fine-tuning its pricing practices to try to lift sluggish sales of personal computers to the home market and to increase its profits. The company will make deeper price cuts than previously planned on some of its Pentium chips in August, on a third or less of its lines, analysts predict. But Intel will then hold prices steady through the end of 1996. [35.]
 
MGM Remains on Kerkorian's Mind
Kirk Kerkorian just cannot seem to stay away from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc. Mr. Kerkorian, the Las Vegas billionaire who has owned MGM two times before, is joining forces with the studio's chairman, Frank G. Mancuso, and his management team, in a bid for MGM. Also part of the team is Seven Networks, an Australian television company. A person close to the team said the three were offering about $1.3 billion. [35.]
 
Venezuela Gets $1.4 Billion Credit
Venezuela was awarded a $1.4 billion credit from the International Monetary Fund, a distinction that serves as a seal of approval on the country's new economic plan. The I.M.F. said the program would redress a dismal economic situation in a potentially rich oil-producing country, which has experienced slow growth, 57 percent inflation and a big budget deficit. [3.]
 
New Estimate of S.& L. Bailout Cost
The General Accounting Office released the most comprehensive study so far on the costs of the savings and loan bailout, placing a total price tag on the debacle of nearly half a trillion dollars, including more than $130 billion from taxpayers. The figures were roughly in line with previous estimates, and included both direct and indirect costs as well as interest payments that will run for decades. [34.]
 
Milken Settles Lawsuits
Michael R. Milken has quietly settled lawsuits with his former accountant, removing one worry as Mr. Milken's recent business activities continue to be scrutinized by Securities and Exchange Commission investigators. [34.]
 
Putting a Premium on Wind
The city-owned utility in Traverse City, Mich., has persuaded customers to pay 20 percent more for electricity to gain a clean source of energy from the nation's largest windmill. This is the first time a windmill has been built by charging utility customers a premium. [6.]
 
Dollar Gains Strength
The dollar rose against most leading currencies, helped by big purchases by Japanese buyers and by gains in the United States bond market. The strength of the dollar against the yen also helped it advance against the mark and other currencies. [32.]
 
Corn and Soybean Prices Surge
Corn and soybean futures prices surged on the Chicago Board of Trade, following forecasts for scorching, dry weather in the Midwest that threatens to ravage late-planted crops. On other markets, coffee prices fell and natural gas rose. [32.]

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Chrysler Quarter Profit Surges but Stock Takes a Hit

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 12

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation announced today that its second-quarter earnings surged more than sevenfold, meeting Wall Street's expectations, but its stock fell as investors worried about slowing auto sales and growing competition in key markets like sport utility vehicles and mini-vans.
Chrysler said its net income totaled $1.04 billion, or $2.77 a share, for the quarter. Adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split, effective Monday, the auto maker said it earned $1.39 a share in the most recent quarter. 
 Chrysler's after-tax profits were the third highest ever, after the fourth quarters of 1994 and 1995, when the company had substantial one-time tax credits. The company's pretax profits of $1.72 billion were the highest ever.
Moreover, sales in the latest quarter rose 26 percent, to $15.84 billion.
But traders on Wall Street were not satisfied, driving Chrysler's stock down $1.25 to close at $56.25. The Standard & Poor's index of the Big Three auto stocks has fallen 16.2 percent from a peak on May 22, as worries have spread about slowing sales, fierce competition, a possibly slowing economy and a strengthening dollar that helps Japanese auto makers.
Chrysler earned only $135 million, or 35 cents a share, on sales of just $12.52 billion in the second quarter of last year. But sales and earnings were depressed then by the company's difficulties in introducing a new line of mini-vans that have since proved very profitable.
Officials at Chrysler -- the third-largest American auto maker -- were cautiously optimistic about the future. "Assuming the economy holds, interest rates don't increase substantially and the industry settles with its represented workers without a strike, we're now projecting 1996 U.S. industry sales of 15.5 million units, up from earlier forecast of 15.3 million units," said Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, in a statement this morning.
Chrysler executives played down the possibility that the company's fat profit margins, which were $1,905 a vehicle in the second quarter, would erode as American and Japanese rivals introduce new sport utility vehicles and mini-vans. Chrysler's highly successful Jeep division and the Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town & Country mini-vans are the cornerstones of the company's profitability.
James P. Holden, the executive vice president for sales and marketing, said in a telephone conference call with reporters that rivals had introduced new models before with limited success in gaining market share. "We've never had anybody take a bite out of us," he said.
Chrysler was the first auto maker to mass-produce a modern mini-van, and Mr. Holden said that the company was determined to stay the leader in that market. "We understand that segment better than anybody else," he said.
Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto industry analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company, said that Chrysler remained in a fairly strong competitive position and that the fall in its stock today mainly reflected investor disenchantment with the entire auto sector.
"It's more of an industry concern rather than a Chrysler concern," he said. "We're at about as good as you're going to get."
Shares in the General Motors Corporation fell $1 today, to $48.25, while Ford Motor Company's stock dropped 37.5 cents, to $30.75.
W. Van Bussmann, Chrysler's chief economist, warned today in the company's conference call with reporters that the dollar's recent strength against the Japanese yen threatened to erode the American auto maker's recent gains. He contended that the dollar's strength reflected intervention in currency markets this year by the Bank of Japan and said that the Administration should get in touch with the bank to complain.
But Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said that there was limited evidence that the dollar's rise was the result of any Government intervention.
Chrysler's results for the last quarter include a $101 million gain, or $87 million after taxes, from the sale of the military electronics and aircraft-remodeling divisions. The results also include a $65 million charge, or $100 million after taxes, for losses on the company's investment in the Thrifty Rent-A-Car System Inc.
Chrysler is trying to sell Thrifty along with another auto rental company, Dollar Rent A Car Systems Inc. "We view the rental car industry as one you can participate in quite nicely without owning a rental car company, and with less risk," said Gary C. Valade, Chrysler's chief financial officer.

HEADLINE: Immigration Service Needs a Major Overhaul

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The photographs accompanying your July 9 news article about New York State farm workers were worth thousands of words. No other occupational group in America today would be expected to live with outhouses. 
 Although the only real avenue for meaningful improvement in farm workers' living and working conditions is self-organization, it is naive to suggest, as the article does, that if workers merely "understood how essential they are to the industry . . . they might be less timid about asking for better terms."
There is an oversupply of farm labor in the United States, resulting in high unemployment, underemployment and low wages. Many workers do not speak up because they fear replacement by a more compliant worker. The agricultural industry has perpetuated an oversupply of labor through immigration and labor legislation and by hiring workers who lack authorized status.
Farm labor organizing is made difficult by the lack of resources available to unions, discriminatory treatment of farm workers in labor legislation and the limited government resources assigned to enforce the law against the powerful agribusiness industry. Public support for labor organizing and boycotts against the products of abusive employers helps farm workers overcome these odds.

HEADLINE: A Fundamental Problem

BYLINE: By JASON DEPARLE; Jason DeParle is a staff writer for the Magazine, based in Washington.

 BODY:
BOB DOLE DOES NOT MAKE SMALL TALK EASILY, but as his plane idles this campaign morning, he gives it a go. He sheds his suit coat and strolls back to the press cabin, where, in a starched shirt, he stands and starts chatting about his dog. Dole mentions the going-away party that awaits him in the Senate and flatters reporters by promising to have them home early, in time to take the afternoon off.
The geniality does not last. 
 "Senator, a serious question," begins one of the two dozen journalists who have just watched him work a convention of Catholic editors. "Can you tell us about your visit with the Cardinal?" More specifically, the reporter wants to know what Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua of Philadelphia said about the party's anti-abortion plank, the 98 words of political nitroglycerin that are threatening to detonate next month at the Republican Party's national convention in San Diego.
Dole's mouth tightens and his eyes flicker warily. "Obviously he feels strongly about it," he says. Well yes, Senator, but how about you? How do you feel? During the long pause that follows, Dole looks about as comfortable as Dan Quayle at a spelling bee; the grinding of the mental gears is all but audible as he searches for something to say.
Failing, he simply turns and stalks off. This odd, silent exit is nearly complete when he returns to vent a final word of protest. "If war were declared tonight and I went on a talk show," he growls, "the first question would be about abortion."
The whirring microcassettes replay every word, but the real issue is not abortion, and Dole himself knows it. The debate about platform language has saturated the news for weeks, down to the level of farce, but as a guidepost to action, the platform is all but meaningless. What's really at stake is the formidable coalition that has brought Republican victories in three of the last four Presidential elections and established the party dominance nationwide. More specifically, the question is whether Dole can mobilize the religious conservatives, who are at once the party's most energetic supporters and also its most obstreperous. And can he do it without alienating the other constituents -- economic conservatives and moderate swing voters -- he needs to overcome his daunting deficit in the polls?
Heading toward San Diego, he is more than mindful of his party's mistakes at the Houston convention in 1992, when Patrick Buchanan's call for a "religious war" thrilled the faithful but sent others fleeing the Big Tent. These days, there are intriguing divisions inside the religious right itself, at least at the leadership level and perhaps as the grass roots, too. There are unbowed believers like Buchanan, who demand orthodoxy on abortion and gay rights. But there are others, most notably Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, who find Dole's half-loaf offering of old-fashioned, mainstream conservatism preferable to noble defeat. Dole sought the nomination claiming he could unite the party's ideological camps; now, through awkward silences and caustic outbursts, he is mired in the work of proving it.
Dole's ties to religious conservatives have always had an air of ambiguity, despite two impressive credentials -- his solid anti-abortion voting record and his popular, evangelical wife. The movement runs on ideological fervor; Dole is a Beltway operator distrustful of insurgencies. Where the insurgents are earnest, he is ironic. Where they demand conviction, he worships the effective compromise. Before a movement born of preachers, Dole stands a legislator through to the bone. The intraparty abortion wars of the past few months have only magnified the underlying doubts. Dole brokered a peace, then shocked his own staff by scrapping it and lashing out at a prominent opponent of abortion. "I don't know where these people come from, you know," he said.
Perhaps Dole still harbors long-shot hopes of crowning his ticket with Colin Powell, who supports abortion rights. Perhaps he is seeking his own Sister Souljah, some irksome ally he can profitably defy to broadcast his own independence. Or maybe he just figures that with President Clinton as the alternative, religious conservatives have no place to go. Maybe he even believes that beneath the roar, the Christian right is a paper tiger.
But when he arrives in San Diego next month, Dole will be surrounded by delegates disproportionately chosen from the movement's ranks. And they have readied themselves for rebellion, against the leadership of the party and even the conciliators in their own ranks. Earlier this month, Dole riled them again when he said he would have no problem with a Vice President who supported abortion rights. Possible insurrections now lurk on any number of fronts -- including the platform, the treatment of Buchanan and Dole's choice of a running mate.
Trailing this summer by as much as 20 points, Dole cannot live without the foot soldiers of the religious right. But two related questions are as pointed as ever: Can he live with them? And can they live with him?
 
SENATOR INSIDE'S HISTORY WITH THE BELIEVERS
BOB DOLE SWEPT THE FURNITURE from his Senate office in the spring of 1993 and invited a crowd to breakfast. Though the leaders of the Christian right had been blamed for George Bush's defeat in the previous fall's election, Dole wanted to keep getting to know them. A cross-section of the self-described "family values" movement showed up. Among them were Ralph Reed, the fresh-faced Wunderkind of the Christian Coalition, and his older, overshadowed rival, Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council. There were representatives of Phyllis Schlafly's Eagle Forum, Louis Sheldon's Traditional Values Coalition and Beverly LaHaye's Concerned Women for America. While scarcely household names, these were the organizers with the mailing lists and telephone trees, the ones who can light up the Capitol switchboard over Washington's apostasies.
Dole served them fruit, cereal and a videotape lampooning Bob Dole. The sketch, from "Saturday Night Live," featured a caustic Dole (Dan Aykroyd) doing battle on health care with an overbearing Hillary Rodham Clinton (Jan Hooks) as her feckless husband (Phil Hartman) looked on. The Aykroyd character was sufficiently true to Dole's dark side that not everyone knew whether to laugh: "All right, Hillary, one more word outta you and you're gonna be a stain on that back wall." But Dole thought it was a riot. He took questions, joked about the legislative session and sent people home feeling good.
It was May 18, 1993 -- nearly three years before the first primary vote would be cast. Reed was particularly impressed. "What's so smart about it was he knew that most of those leaders would support someone else, either privately or publicly," he recalls. "But the key was: 'Let's stay close, let's have our line of communication.' "
In other words, Dole understood himself well enough to realize that he wouldn't be the first choice of most Christian activists; he understood politics well enough to realize that he couldn't afford to be their last. From the spring of 1993 to his breakthrough in the South Carolina primary nearly three years later, Dole did just enough to get by.
A Republican Presidential aspirant really has no other choice. Fully 23 percent of registered Republicans now say yes when asked if they consider themselves "part of the conservative Christian political movement, also known as the religious right." (The figure is an average from six polls taken this year by CBS and The New York Times.) And larger percentages show up to vote. This year, 29 percent of the primary voters called themselves part of the religious right. In the kickoff state of Iowa, the number was 35 percent. In South Carolina, the gateway to the South, it was 36 percent.
But even those figures may underestimate the disproportionate influence that comes from the advocates' commitment. God is a formidable ward boss, and people whose politics flow from their faith make unusually dedicated grunts. Two years ago, Campaign and Elections magazine did a nationwide survey and concluded that religious conservatives "dominated" the Republican Party in 18 states. (That means a majority of the party's governing body was "directly affiliated" with the movement.) In 13 other states, the movement had "substantial" influence, meaning its members accounted for more than a quarter of the state hierarchy.
Dole presented the Christian advocates with a mixed picture. He is a divorced man who is said to attend the church of the Sunday talk show. Intensely private, he is ill-at-ease with the pulpit's confessional style. And while he has a strong anti-abortion record, he prefers to talk about other things, like deficit reduction or taxes. Moreover, the very quality that made him effective in the Senate -- his skill at forging compromises -- makes him suspect to those seeking ideological steel. "I am willing to be another Ronald Reagan, if that's what you want," Dole said last year, as if to advertise his rubber soul.
On the other hand, distasteful as he might find it, Dole had shown he could play the abortion card when it suited his purposes. Indeed, he was the rare member of the Senate who owed his seat to his exploitation of the issue. He was heading toward defeat in his 1974 race when, in the final minute of a televised debate, Dole assailed the obstetrician he was running against: "Why do you do abortions? And why do you favor abortions on demand?" Dr. Bill Roy, his Democratic opponent, was left speechless, not least (as Richard Ben Kramer reports in his book "Bob Dole") because he loathed abortions and had performed them only on rare instances to save a mother's life. Dole closed the race by telling schoolchildren to "go home and ask your parents if they know how many abortions Bill Roy has performed." He won by a sliver.
And however warmed-over Dole's own faith might appear, his wife has no hesitation in proclaiming hers. Indeed, for the past nine years Elizabeth Dole, the president of the American Red Cross, has traveled the country discussing "the difference Jesus Christ has made in my life." A former Cabinet secretary under Presidents Reagan and Bush, Dole likens herself to Esther, the Old Testament queen who clung to her comforts. She says she, too, was once spiritually drowning in the flood of her secular successes. Then beginning in the mid-1980's, a series of Bible studies and prayer meetings led her back to her faith. "I knew it was time to cease living life backwards, time to strive to put Christ first, pre-eminent -- with no competition, at the very center of my life," she says.
It sounds like something Pat Robertson might say -- and the affection of the televangelist and Christian Coalition chairman gave Bob Dole another hidden asset. The two had grown fond of each other during their unsuccessful Presidential races in 1988. An unlikely match on the surface, the legislator and the preacher have a few things in common, including a generational bond (Dole is only seven years older); the Senate (where Robertson's father also served); law school, and military service.
Though Robertson shuns interview requests (especially when they concern his conspiracy theories about Jewish bankers), I found him one evening at a banquet table honoring Billy Graham. Effusive in his praise of Dole, he launched into a story about a 1988 Presidential debate. With Democrats and Republicans all set to quiz one another, Dole sent an emissary to Robertson's room to warn him of the questions he planned to ask. "He wanted our guys -- namely, the Republican candidates -- to look good," Robertson said. "I just liked him. Bob is a straight-shooting, honest, honorable man." As for Dole's wife, "She's deeply loved by people; she's a dear friend of mine. I think the world of her and I'd love to see her in the White House."
As the 1996 race took shape, Dole got a lift from the abstention of rivals with more obvious appeal to Christian conservatives, including Dan Quayle, William Bennett and Jack Kemp. Then he waged an effective campaign to keep the candidate he considered most threatening, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, from outflanking him on the right.
In part, he did it with hires. Beefing up his staff with movement types, Dole brought a crusading conservative lawyer named Kyle McSlarrow into his Senate office to keep an eye on legislative business and he brought Steve Scheffler and Judy Haynes into his campaign, giving him the services of two top Christian Coalition organizers.
In part he did it with bills. Dole beat Gramm to the punch with proposals to curb affirmative action, rein in Government regulation and bolster private-property rights. And in part he did it with the inherent power of his post as Senate majority leader. When Clinton nominated Dr. Henry Foster as Surgeon General, Dole had another obstetrician to attack; he denied Foster a confirmation vote, citing his conflicting statements about the number of abortions he had performed.
As he tightened his ties to the Christian right, Dole got considerable lift from Gramm's own missteps, most famously his disastrous meeting with James Dobson, the Colorado Springs psychologist and religious broadcaster. Though little known to the general public, Dobson is the Sam Walton of the family values movement, a distributor with unparalleled reach. His daily broadcasts attract more than three million listeners on 1,500 radio stations, and his organization, Focus on the Family, has a mailing list of 2.2 million. In April 1995, he flew to Washington to hear out Gramm.
The meeting was sufficiently important that Ralph Reed, seeking to be useful, stopped in beforehand to warn Gramm that Dobson would want moral reassurances. Instead, Gramm burst in late and proclaimed, "I ain't running for preacher, that's your job." Incensed, Dobson spread the word. Gramm grew so desperate to regain his squandered credibility that a few months later he began mass mailings to announce his anticipation of the Second Coming. "And when He comes back, He won't need government to impose His values," he wrote.
Dole found a better way of courting the religious right: he blasted the morals of Hollywood. The timing couldn't have been more fortuitous. Just as Gramm was self-destructing, Dole was denouncing the "mindless violence and loveless sex" glorified by the entertainment industry. Though Dole himself nearly balked at giving it (as Bob Woodward reports in "The Choice"), the May 1995 speech brought him greater accolades than his campaign had dared imagine. Its glory is that it worked on two levels. Without ever mentioning God or church, Dole found an intimate connection to conservative Christians. But he also found enough secular resonance to land on the "CBS Evening News."
The speech came long before Buchanan's insurgency caught fire and before Reed went quietly scrambling for a fire hose for Dole. But to this day, the Dole campaign regards the speech as both a highlight of the past and a model for the future. It remains in continual search of Hollywood sequels -- double-coded messages that rouse the faithful while also assembling the larger coalition Dole needs. "The foundation of Bob Dole's victory as the Republican nominee was made in the Hollywood speech," Reed says. "That was where he made an explicit and eloquent appeal to religious conservatives, based on a moral issue."
 
PRIMARY DANCE: ONE STEP TOWARD GOD, ONE STEP BACK
A FEW DAYS BEFORE THE NEW HAMPshire primary, Elizabeth Dole battled a blizzard to reach a Christian Coalition rally in Manchester. But she might just as profitably have stayed home. As she labored through her speech with a cheerleader smile, the boredom in the room was palpable. This was Buchanan country, and Buchanan himself had just roused the crowd with a defiant defense of his Houston speech. "There is a cultural war!" he bellowed to chants of "Go, Pat, Go!"
In the aftermath, Dole was left facing the flannel-shirt crowd in a perky lime dress; she looked like a country-club hostess and sounded like a banker. "Now how would a balanced budget affect you?" she said. "Well, for one thing, interest rates would drop 2 percent." Twenty-six television cameras rolled and no one clapped.
Representative Bob Dornan, the Zhirinovsky of the race, happened to be sitting in the front row, where he leaned over and promised Garry Trudeau, the creator of "Doonesbury," "I won't lose their attention." And he didn't. He followed Dole's flop with an incoherent screed about abortion, Jesus and United Nations troops, and he won a standing ovation. It was a bad sign, on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, to earn less applause than Bob Dornan.
But the Dole campaign's relationship with the religious right has just this rocking-horse rhythm: one lurch forward and one lurch back. Every appeal to Christian conservatives seems counterbalanced by a move that ignores, insults or misgauges them, at times even gratuitously so. It could be a Machiavellian plot to establish Dole's steely independence. At times, it could be ineptitude. But William Kristol, the Republican strategist who regularly throws darts at Dole in his magazine, The Weekly Standard, offers a third interpretation: when it comes to those on the religious right, Dole is deeply ambivalent. "He thinks they're very important and he thinks they're very difficult," Kristol says. As a result, Dole finds himself "oscillating between semi-pandering to them and semi-offending them."
The semi-offenses had started long before the primaries. Dole tangled with Christian conservatives over last year's welfare bill, backing cuts that were (slightly) less severe than they desired. He risked their wrath over homosexuality, when he said his staff was wrong to return a campaign check to the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group. He ignored the calls from the Christian right to fire Sheila Burke, his chief of staff and a supporter of abortion rights, whom they assailed as "Hillary Lite." And he ignored calls to sign a pledge, being circulated by Phyllis Schlafly, to keep the anti-abortion plank. "Sign the pledge, sign the pledge," his detractors taunted last September at the Christian Coalition's annual convention.
Dole's troubles with the religious right accelerated last December when he fumbled a question on "Meet the Press." Would he support a constitutional amendment to ban all abortions? "I supported that at one time," Dole said. "I would not do it again." What's more, he added, "My view as a Republican candidate is this shouldn't be a dominant issue in the Republican nomination or the campaign for President in 1996."
He might just as well have gone on the "700 Club" to spit in Pat Robertson's eye. It took several days of Dole "clarifications" to quell the protests from Gary Bauer and Ralph Reed. Dole said he was simply reiterating his longstanding support of exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. But Iowa right-to-lifers were still carrying the clips around two months later on caucus day.
And Dole was tripping on his words once more, on the cusp of the South Carolina primary. A woman stood up during a television debate and asked, "If I am brutally raped by a vicious criminal," would Dole let her have an abortion. First he said no. Then he said yes. Then he said he agreed with Buchanan, who, in much more lyrical terms, had said absolutely not.
As his abortion credentials flagged, Dole did himself further damage with the Christian right: he went on the air with television ads dismissing Buchanan as an extremist. Outside the narrow confines of Christian conservatism, this might seem an unremarkable statement; certainly Buchanan's been called worse. But inside the movement -- indeed, inside factions of the Dole campaign -- jaws were dropping. Christian conservatives had been called "extremists" for years, and many deeply resented it. Dole simply couldn't have picked a more loaded phrase. "These people feel that when you use that term, that it's like the N-word to an African-American," Reed says. "You're shooting at Buchanan and you're hitting the base of the party."
A flabbergasted Buchanan, feeling personally betrayed, began warning that he might not support Dole even if he won the nomination. Reed was quietly seeking to stem Buchanan's surge, but he, too, felt the need to react; avoiding any mention of Dole by name, he warned that such language represented "the curse words of the establishment and the slurs of the chatter class." To this day, Bay Buchanan, the candidate's sister, manager and confidante, sounds like Joe Pesce when she conjures the attack on family honor. "It was a slur against my brother -- Bob Dole knows my brother," she says. "It is extremely insulting."
After airing the ads for nine days in five states, a testy Dole finally pulled them and wrapped himself in semantics. The ads had literally called Buchanan "too extreme," leaving off the suffix. "I haven't characterized him as 'an extremist,' " he said. "I have said 'mainstream or extreme.' " But within a few days, Dole's deputy campaign chairman, Bill Lacy, was out of a job, and his promotion of the E-word, in whichever iteration, was one of the reasons.
In an interview months later, eager to boost Dole's standing, Reed gave him the benefit of the doubt. "I sensed that somebody had written those remarks for Dole," he said. "He didn't know it was code." But in a sense that's worse: by Reed's current logic, Dole is so out of touch with religious conservatives that he can shower them with epithets and not even know it.

AT THE GRASS ROOTS FOR GOD, BUT NOT NECESSARILY FOR DOLE
THE DEPTH OF THE RESULTING DOUBTS about Dole could be seen one April evening in Horseheads, N.Y., a wisp of a town a few miles from the Pennsylvania border. Four hundred and fifty people, from the Mayor on down, had gathered at the high-school cafeteria, where a roast beef dinner would net $20,000 for a local anti-abortion group. Gary Bauer was the keynote speaker. A short, slight, serious man with a nasally voice and bulging round eyes, Bauer had come up the hard way. He was born on the wrong side -- the sinning side -- of the river; his home of Newport, Ky., was a blue-collar gambling den in the shadows of Cincinnati, the birthplace of Ivory soap. His father was a janitor and a lifelong alcoholic.
The younger Bauer found the Baptist church through his maternal grandmother and became a teen-age enthusiast in a Republican crusade to clean up the town's bars. After earning a law degree at Georgetown University, Bauer wound up as a 35-year-old gofer in the Reagan White House, literally "getting people's lunches"; he finished his tour as Reagan's domestic policy adviser and one of his most visible New Right ideologists.
Along the way he met James Dobson, who had joined a White House anti-smut crusade. On the outer edges of Dobson's broadcasting-publishing-counseling empire was a moribund public-policy outfit called the Family Research Council. Dobson brought in Bauer to run it in 1988, and it has since become a buzzing warren of "family values" orthodoxy, with 75 employees, a $10 million budget and a full complement of books, newsletters and targets: from job-training programs to the Beijing women's conference. Though their groups are now legally independent, Bauer still operates as a Washington lens for Dobson, who features him regularly in broadcasts and publications.
The Horseheads crowd greeted Bauer like a star. They carried Jell-O molds and fruit punch to a reception in his honor, toted copies of his books and asked for his autographs. There were two doctors in the crowd, a man who runs a pizza parlor, a stay-at-home mom and a woman who makes jewelry from plastic fetus molds. The conversation quickly turned to the presumptive nominee. A middle-aged man in a business suit said: "I just can't get excited about Bob Dole."
A woman who home-schools her six children said: "He's so wishy-washy!"
A 40-something precinct worker said: "He talks pro-life but he acts pro-death!"
A grandmother asked Bauer what he made of Dole. "The only way to win is if he's clear on our issues," Bauer said. "Which he isn't!" she barked.
Caught in this semicircle of Betty Crocker ward bosses, Bauer gripped his punch glass with both hands and fought off a satisfied smile. "This is the time to let Senator Dole know that if he walks on you. . . ."
"We'll walk on him!" growled an otherwise placid woman in a floral print dress.
Standing in the lobby of the Howard Johnson's the following morning, Bauer had only one lament: if only Dole could have been there! "I think it would have helped him understand that he doesn't have the natural constituency of the Republican party nailed," he said. At least not that portion that pays for dinner with checks adorned with fetuses. "For those people last night, this is the reason they're in politics. And if you play games with the issue, you lose."
 
RALPH REED: MIDDLE MAN, BUT FOR WHOM?
FLYING BACK FROM HORSEHEADS, BAUER changed planes at LaGuardia, where he ran into Ralph Reed. On the surface, they were all smiles, but the underlying strains are no secret. Bauer is the Avis of the pair, perpetually No. 2, trying harder, and resentful of Reed's astonishing new market share; Reed, after all, was still jockeying for position in the College Republicans club at the University of Georgia when Bauer was sitting in the White House.
The two chatted amiably and parted. But a few weeks later, sitting in his office, I asked Bauer about Reed's new book, "Active Faith," which admonishes movement leaders to exercise a new "grace and humility, in speech and deed." Bauer frowned. He did not note that Reed himself used to boast of leaving his opponents in body bags. But he did mention the 1992 fund-raising letter from Reed's boss, Pat Robertson, which said feminism "encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians."
"I don't have any objection to the idea of civility," Bauer said. "What's objectionable is to be lectured by someone who seems to think he is noble in this regard and everyone else needs lecturing." A few weeks later, I asked again: had Bauer read Reed's book? "I've been doing so much promotion of mine," he said. "We're up to 363,000 copies!"
There is more than mere ego involved. The two have competing visions of how the movement should evolve, with Bauer valuing purity over practicality. "This is obviously delicate," he said one day, tiptoeing around the subject. "Ralph is probably a bit more interested in being an inside player in the Republican Party."
A bit more interested indeed.
Reed may have been virtually unknown when Pat Robertson discovered him but he had spent his whole life training for the job. The son of a Navy surgeon, he grew up in Miami and Toccoa, Ga., and managed his first campaign in junior high school, his own race for the student council. In 1989, as the famous story goes, Robertson was at an inaugural party for George Bush when he met the impressive young organizer with the impossibly boyish face. He asked Reed for suggestions on salvaging a new grass-roots organization from his leftover campaign mailing list. Reed wrote a memo, and the two were off and running. Reed's telegenic brilliance offered a reassuring public face and it continues to deflect attention from Robertson's often-stated doubts about such matters as the separation of church and state.
Reed, who is 35, says his own "faith experience" occurred in 1983, shortly after his college graduation. He had come to Washington to head the College Republicans when one evening he spied a prominent conservative drinking and chasing women. Wanting to police his own morals, Reed decided to find a church by looking in the Yellow Pages -- under E for evangelical. Why evangelical? "Because I knew from my political involvement that they were solid," he explained recently.
The answer unlocks the essential Reed. While many religious leaders have described how their politics flowed from their faith (Reed's stated idol, Martin Luther King Jr., comes to mind), in Reed's case the reverse held true: his politics preceded -- even determined -- his church. The point isn't that Reed's faith is insincere, only that it is inessential to his vocation. Even when founding the Christian Coalition in 1989, "I did not consider myself a 'Christian activist,' " he writes in his book. "My background was as a Republican political operative."
His foreground still is. "Active Faith" puts the emphasis on the active, with Reed according himself V.I.P. status on nearly every page. "I ran across the Capitol grounds at breakneck speed and jumped into a waiting car, which squealed out of the parking lot and headed for the television studio," he writes in a typical passage. Like many others on the Christian right, Reed likes to describe himself as a member of a persecuted minority. But his recorded responses to the moments of alleged bigotry are revealing. There is nothing of the anxious trembling, the nauseating self-doubt, that has greeted the truly persecuted -- Gandhi, say, as he peered out at the British Empire. There is no internal bleeding. There is only the adrenaline rush that comes from glimpsing a tactical edge. When a Democratic Congressman attacked the religious right a few years ago, Reed joyously dashed off a press release. "That was all the opening we needed," he writes.
For the past several years, Reed has been admonishing his movement to broaden its reach and relax its ideological severity. With a doctorate in American history, he is painfully aware of the self-marginalizing political instincts evangelicals have shown, from William Jennings Bryan to Jerry Falwell, and he does not want to follow their path. As early as 1993, Reed published an article in Policy Review, the journal of the Heritage Foundation, arguing for a new Christian right. For religious conservatives "to win at the ballot box and in the court of public opinion," he wrote, they must embrace "the concerns of average voters in the areas of taxes, crime, government waste, health care and financial security."
Notice the words "to win." Reed is not indulging in philosophical rumination; he is counting votes. Like Dole, Reed knows that Christian conservatives, for all their vaunted influence in some Republican primaries, cannot win real power on their own. They can turn out voters and capture school-board seats. In close Congressional elections, they can make a difference. But the broader the race, the more their power fades -- especially when their own influence and ideology become the issue. Witness the defeats of Mike Farris, Jim Miller and Oliver North, three movement figures who ran for statewide offices in Virginia. All went down in flames in the Coalition's backyard.
The group's most celebrated victories tell the flip side of the same story. The Christian Coalition may have helped Newt Gingrich capture the House, as Reed often says, but the Republicans' Contract With America gave them virtually nothing in return. As a prime example of the group's electoral muscle, Reed often points to the 1992 election of Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia. And the Coalition's support may have indeed made the difference; the group claims to have spread more than two million voter guides across Georgia. But as Reed acknowledges, Coverdell supports abortion rights! What Reed has called a symbol of his movement's "remarkable effectiveness" is simultaneously a symbol of its limits. It is "remarkably effective" only when tempering a central belief.
The 1996 campaign brought Reed a predicament -- "all dressed up and nowhere to go," he said recently. There was no obvious figure to support. Buchanan, of course, is the very definition of a social conservative: adamantly anti-abortion, anti-gay rights and vociferous on the traditional values themes. He is also precisely the kind of divisive, marginalizing figure that Reed considers a prescription for defeat. Though Reed had previously avoided public derogation, in "Active Faith" he goes as far as saying that Buchanan's campaign "recalled the pro-family movement's previous status as the red-headed stepchild of American politics."
What ensued is what Reed himself has called "a delicate dance." Officially, the group remained neutral. Behind the scenes, Reed said in an interview, "I had a very self-conscious strategy to have Christian Coalition operatives working in every Presidential campaign." The better to cover his bets. ("I think early on he was watching Gramm," Bay Buchanan says.) But what Reed finally appeared to bet on most of all was the success of the front-runner.
The subject is a touchy one. Reed adamantly denies any tilt toward Dole. "We didn't do anything to advocate the election or defeat of Dole," he says. "I was not tacitly for anyone. I was neutral." But there are three things to keep in mind. By the time he hit South Carolina, Dole was on the ropes; Reed considered the surging Buchanan a threat to his movement, and the Coalition's South Carolina network was crucial in helping Dole turn Buchanan back. Speaking of Reed, Bay Buchanan says, "There's no question in my mind that he was involved, to make certain Pat wasn't the nominee."
The details make for a long he-said, she-said exchange between the Buchanans and Reed. The Buchanan camp is especially bitter about the Coalition's voter guides, the main weapon in the group's arsenal. To preserve its credibility, not to mention its tax-exempt status, the Coalition clings to the fiction that the guides are strictly informational, with no endorsement intent. But Democratic candidates have long considered them the paper equivalent of a hit and run. And so now does Bay Buchanan. The guide omitted Dole's support of Nafta and GATT; it was silent on Dole's refusal to sign the Schlafly abortion pledge, and it neglected his support of Clinton's Supreme Court choices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, both of whom are supporters of abortion rights. Indeed, of the 14 issues listed in the guide, Dole and Buchanan are shown holding the same position on 12. "The conclusion, from the editing, is that there is no difference," Bay Buchanan says.
Reed defends the guides by saying that Dole aides were correspondingly upset that the guides noted Dole's support for rape and incest exceptions and his refusal to condemn Congressional pensions. "The Christian Coalition distributed nonpartisan voter guides that favored no candidate," Reed says.
Bay Buchanan is equally miffed about the grass-roots jockeying in South Carolina. While much of the credit for Dole's win has gone to David Beasley, the Governor, and Carroll Campbell, the ex-Governor, Dole's Coalition connections were also a key. Reed's former deputy, Judy Haynes, had been working the state for Dole for a year. "She basically moved to South Carolina," says Scott Reed, the Dole campaign manager (and no relation to Ralph Reed). On most of her trips, Haynes stayed with Roberta Combs, the Coalition's South Carolina director. While Combs has said she stayed officially neutral, Scott Reed puts it differently: "She and Judy are the best of friends, and they went down there and put the thing together with Beasley."
Ralph Reed says he had nothing to do with Haynes's work for Dole. But Rod Mays, a Greenville, S.C., pastor, says he received numerous phone calls from other local Coalition leaders urging him to support Dole despite their official neutrality. "What really angered me was an organization that claims to be Christian talking out of both sides of their mouth," Mays says.
Enough people share Mays's perception to leave Reed in a potentially awkward position: some of his troops think he's responsible for the candidate now flouting their concerns. Whether that will drive him harder to bring Dole around -- or at some point denounce him, to burnish his movement bona fides -- is still anyone's guess. Bay Buchanan goes as far as arguing that Reed is "no longer a legitimate leader of the social conservatives in this country." In New Jersey, a Coalition member was so incensed at what he called the tilt toward Dole that he put out an electronic news release with this subtle title: "The New Blasphemy: Rigging the Election Results by Fraud in the Name of Jesus Christ!"
Though a lawyer for the Coalition fired off a letter, warning of libel, Reed now says it's all a sign of progress: "Any leader of a social-reform movement who is on the cutting edge of tactical and strategic shifts by that movement is going to experience some level of ambivalence, and sometimes opposition, from others in that movement. And that is not a sign of anything other than the fact that you're moving the ball down the field."
 
ON ABORTION: DOLE MAKES PEACE -- AND BREAKS IT
ACROSS FROM THE National Cathedral in Washington, the Cafe Deluxe offers meat loaf, martinis and a mahagony bar -- just the sort of a stylish new place where a happy operative might sit and savor a success. On the the second Monday of June, a high prince of the Dole campaign was doing exactly that. He was recounting -- with great detail, understandable pride and an insistence on anonymity -- how the campaign had defused the abortion plank controversy, thereby insuring a harmonious convention in San Diego.
Only a few days earlier, after months of anticipation, Dole had finally stated his position. Despite the growing criticisms of moderate Republican governors, he would keep the strict anti-abortion plank. But he would also add "tolerance language" to assure supporters of abortion rights that their concerns were understood. Dole's statement had achieved the seemingly impossible. It won generous praise from the advocates of abortion rights, like Gov. Christie Todd Whitman of New Jersey. Yet the opponents, including Buchanan himself, declared they were happy, too.
"We're geniuses!" the Dole aides had told one another, as they watched that evening's news. There was just one arcane detail left: where to put this "tolerance language"? Dole had strongly implied, without flatly stating, that it would go in the preamble to the entire platform, not in the abortion plank itself. That way it would acknowledge disagreements in many areas, without suggesting any particular wobbliness in the commitment to the unborn.
From afar this seems like so much talk of angels on a pin -- either way, the plank still calls for a complete abortion ban. But to finely trained ears, it is a matter of, well, life and death. "There's no confusion here," Deep Bistro told me as he munched his Caesar salad. "We're talking about the whole platform, not the plank."
What the Dole aide didn't know was that, at the very moment we were eating lunch, Dole was going on CNN to fire-bomb his hard-won peace. The conversation was over, Dole said; the disclaimer goes directly in the plank. "It has been resolved," he said. "I made that decision. It is not negotiable."
And hundreds of anti-abortion delegates immediately vowed to fight him. Representative Henry Hyde, Dole's choice to head the platform committee, even warned that he might resign. What could Dole have been thinking? There are two possibilities: a) he wasn't or b) the plank itself is so unpopular that Dole felt he had to find a way to further distance himself from it, even at the risk of inciting the right. Dole's erratic campaign style points toward the former, but the polling data hint at the latter.
While the anti-abortion forces have fervor on their side, two-thirds of the party favors keeping some form of abortion legal. The plank, by contrast, calls for a constitutional amendment to ban all abortions. There are no stated exceptions for rape or incest; there are no stated exceptions for the life of the mother. There are, it appears, simply no exceptions. According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, when the National Republican Senatorial Committee polled the party this spring, it found that as many as 40 percent of Republicans were considering a vote for Clinton because their own party was so strident on social issues.
Reed saw the problem coming and he wound up the first to be burned. When he sent "Active Faith" to press last winter, he included his own stab at an alternate plank and quickly found himself labeled a Judas. By accident or design, Reed's language was perfectly ambiguous on the central issue of the debate: whether the plank would call for a constitutional amendment. It pledged to "seek by all legal and constitutional means to protect the right to life." But does that mean under the current Constitution? Or under an amended one?
The unveiling of Reed's plank happened to coincide with a news conference Bay Buchanan had organized to threaten Dole, but she now had Reed in her cross hairs as well. "We are saying no words can be changed," she said. "We will fight them inside the convention hall. We will fight them outside the hall. We will fight them on radio, on TV, in the mail, on the phones. We will fight and fight and fight until we win. There is no compromise. There is no negotiating. There is no appeasement."
Within a few days, Reed was calling it all a great misunderstanding; he had written his plank merely as an intellectual exercise, he said, not as a trial balloon. "I think that my pro-family and pro-life credentials are, you know, beyond reproach. For anyone to suggest that I was planning on going to San Diego to water down the platform is laughable." Bay Buchanan puts it differently: "That prodigal son didn't get to the end of the block."
Reed's experience in touching the third rail eerily presaged Dole's. The campaign started searching for a compromise as early as April, when the moderate governors began threatening a floor fight. The Dole aides then found the tolerance language in a particularly thrilling place: Ronald Reagan's 1980 platform. Who would quarrel with the Gipper? Dole gave the go-ahead and they released the statement of June 6 to rave reviews.
Four days later, Dole snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. His vow to single out the abortion plank itself for tolerance language was especially galling to the religious right, since it came during an interview that was mostly devoted to praising their nemesis, Colin Powell. "In my heart, he's a great guy," Dole said. Though Powell has stated he will not join the ticket, he is widely thought to be Dole's first choice as a running mate. And he unambiguously supports abortion rights. Smelling a conspiracy to lure a moderate onto the ticket, the right issued all manner of dark warnings.
By the next day, Dole had had enough. He was stepping down from the Senate, capping a 35-year career on Capitol Hill. He was about to make his last address in the legislative chamber he loved; he was thinking back on his proud battles for food stamps, disability rights and deficit reduction. He made time for a morning interview with a Kansas City television station and was promptly asked about . . . Abortion! The plank! Something Gary Bauer just said!
Gary Bauer? "What's the difference if it's in the preamble or the platform," Dole barked. I mean, this is a moral issue."
Dole went on: "I don't know where Gary Bauer's been all his life, but I've always know that we have had pro-choice Republicans and pro-life Republicans."
And on: "If he's not tolerant, he ought to say so. I happen to be tolerant. . . ."
And even that wasn't enough to get it off Dole's chest. Bauer "misinterprets about everything I say -- I mean, I think he looks for reasons to put out press releases."
Was Dole searching for his Sister Souljah? If so, he didn't quite find her. The rap singer, recall, was advocating the murder of white people; Clinton's rebuke of her during the 1992 campaign was effective but not particularly risky. Dole by contrast might consider Bauer just the kind of unelected, publicity-seeking nag he disdains. But when it comes to abortion, Bauer speaks for a powerful, well-organized faction of the party, whose support Dole needs.
The tumult unfolded according to script. Bauer dashed to the "Crossfire" studio. Dobson interrupted the previously scheduled broadcast across his 1,500-station archipelago. "When you're talking about killing babies," he warned, "there's not a whole lotta room for compromise." Weary of managing the unmanageable, the Dole aides didn't even try to dress up the mess with a positive spin. Their subsequent silence sent only one message: When it comes to this abortion debate, there's no telling what Dole will do.
 
WILL SAN DIEGO BE '92 REVISITED?
AS DOLE GIRDS himself for San Diego, he might stop and think of the Alamo -- or, more precisely, the Alamodome. Sixteen thousand Texas delegates gathered there on a 103-degree day last month, intent on making a statement. The statement was not one of even tepid support for the party's presumed nominee. The statement the delegates made was one of fierce, anti-abortion zeal.
A movement was afoot to keep Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison from joining the 123-member delegation Texas will send to San Diego. Never mind that Hutchison, who won her 1994 election with 61 percent of the vote, happens to be one of the most popular politicians in Texas. She also supports abortion rights. "We are not here to play political games," said Colleen Parro, a leader of the insurrection. "We are here to stamp out a great moral evil: abortion."
The dickering went on for three days, and in the end Hutchison squeaked through. But not by much. After a voice vote proved too close to call, she was declared a victor by the chairman's eye-count of thousands of standing bodies. And Hutchison notwithstanding, the delegation Texas is sending to San Diego cares more about abortion than it cares about Dole. The two Texans who will join the platform committee, David Barton and Betty Lou Martin, are stalwarts of the religious right. Barton is best known as the author of a book called "The Myth of Separation." Of church and state, that is.
So much for the outbreak of "tolerance."
Similar scenes have played out at state conventions across the country. In Washington State, the chairman of the Republican Party got ousted as a delegate after refusing to let Buchanan speak. In Minnesota, two members of the delegation vowed to vote for Alan Keyes if Dole picks a running mate who wants to keep abortion legal. In South Carolina, Carroll Campbell scarcely got himself elected a delegate; though the ex-governor is one of the most popular politicians in the state, he finished 12th in the balloting, behind a slate of unknown Christian Coalition members.
Beyond the abortion plank, there's the question of Buchanan: will he be allowed to speak? Bay Buchanan keeps a map of San Diego on her desk and surveys her options like a SWAT-team captain. "He is owed both an apology and he's owed a prime-time spot," she said. "We expect the address to be prime time inside the convention hall." She stabbed the map. "Otherwise, it'll be prime time outside the convention hall. I have no problem with that. I think the press would be quite interested in a Pat Buchanan speech outside the convention hall."
Reed's role in the endless negotiations is a wonder to behold. He flew into San Antonio by charter plane and veered from provocateur to peacemaker in the course of a single evening. When a fund-raising dinner for the Christian Coalition filled a ballroom with 2,000 people, Reed served red meat. They will not "cower behind the stained-glass ghetto."
"We are Christians!" Reed thundered, and the crowd was on its feet. "And we honor and serve our God. We are not going to apologize for being Christians anymore. To anyone!"
What Reed didn't mention was that he was also neck-deep in the behind-the-scenes efforts to allow Hutchison to become a delegate, despite her support for abortion rights. And when the dinner was over, he retired to a suite the size of a modest train station and talked of possible deals with Dole. He had more angles in mind than I. M. Pei. Where could the tolerance language go? "You could put it at the beginning, you could put it at the end," he said. "You could have it in a declaration of principles. There's been some talk about having a preamble, and then having a declaration of principles, and then having a platform itself.
"We're trying to get to the same place," Reed added. "I am optimistic."
Before heading to San Antonio, I stopped to chat with another "senior official" in the Dole campaign. This one, let's call him Deep Reassurance, scoffed at the idea that Dole has a problem with the right. While a handful of zealots might try to cause trouble, he insisted that religious conservatives were not fixated on abortion. "They live lives like everyone else," he said. "They're interested in taxes, crime, honesty in government."
The plank controversy will eventually get settled, he said, and Dole will then return to events like the Hollywood speech, messages that offer a double bang for the buck. Like time limits on welfare recipients. Campaign polls show that 75 percent of the moderates support them -- as do 85 percent of the religious conservatives. The same goes for term limits for Federal judges. Or a tax credit for families. "And there's economic angst and cultural decline," he went on, in happy anticipation of the misery to milk. "And by doing these things, doing them correctly, you can both energize your base and build a broader electoral coalition."
Candidates shouldn't get too worried about cantankerous members of their base, he added. Democrats like Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis spent too much time worrying about unions and minorities, and they lost. Similarly, George Bush spent too much time in 1992 worrying about religious conservatives. "He paid them so much attention, to the exclusion of other things like jobs and the economy," he said. Clinton, by contrast, often kept his base at odds in 1992, not just with Sister Souljah, but with his calls to end welfare and his support of the death penalty. And he's doing it again this year with homosexual supporters, by refusing to defend gay marriage. "Bill Clinton has shown you can walk pretty far from your base and still not lose them," the Dole aide said.
But can Bob Dole walk that walk? He has a different party, a different personality and a much more contentious issue. On the very day the Texans were jeering the mention of his name at the Alamodome, Dole was in Michigan, trying to get the focus off abortion and on to farm policy. Working a rope line, he came across a middle-aged woman in a flowery blouse holding a placard. "Challenge Clinton, Not Bauer," it said. Seeming not to notice, Dole paused to shake her hand.
"I'm worried about the babies, sir," she said.
" 'Bout what?" Dole asked.
"The babies."
Arrghhh -- one of those! "Yeah, I'm worried too," Dole said, moving on. "Check my record."
"Yeah?" the woman shouted at the back of his head. "Don't waffle so much."
Dole twisted his mouth toward a sardonic smile, but he didn't look back. "We don't waffle," he said.

HEADLINE: Q. & A.

 BODY:

Tenant's Refusal To Pay
 
Q. I own a co-op apartment that I rent out to a subtenant. Recently, in accordance with the sublease agreement, the subtenant's rent increased by 10 percent. However, the subtenant does not want to pay the increase and has sent rent checks for a lower amount with the following endorsement written on the back of the check: "In full payment of all rent due this month."
Can I deposit such checks but still sue the subtenant for the overdue balance? Is it better to retain such checks as evidence to be used in a non-payment proceeding? . . . Hilda Saibon, Brooklyn.
 
A. Samuel Himmelstein, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in landlord-tenant matters, said that assuming the apartment is deregulated and the rent increase is legal (which it would likely not be in a rent-stabilized or rent-controlled apartment), "my advice would be to reject the money and sue for nonpayment of rent for the full amount."
If the owner cashes or deposits the check, Mr. Himmelstein said, there is a likelihood that a court would view acceptance of the check as an agreement with the endorsement it contains.
Moreover, he said, it would be equally unwise for the owner to retain the check without cashing it.
"There are many court cases that say that retention equals acceptance," Mr. Himmelstein said, explaining that while courts vary in their interpretation of how long a check must be held before it is considered accepted, it is always better to err on the side of caution.
"Any landlord's lawyer will tell you that a prompt return of the money to the tenant is critical," he said.
 
Insurance Protection For Mortgages
 
Q. Is there such a thing as mortgage payment protection insurance that covers mortgage payments in the event a homeowner becomes unemployed or unable to work due to illness or disability? . . . Dobie Gresham, Manhattan.
 
A. David Steppat, marketing director for Minnesota Mutual Life, an insurance company in St. Paul, said that such insurance was available in various forms from various sources.
One such product, Mr. Steppat said, is called mortgage disability insurance. Generally, he said, such insurance provides for the payment of mortgage payments in the event the policyholder becomes sick or disabled during the policy period.
"The payment periods will vary," Mr. Steppat said, explaining that the insurance will typically cover mortgage payments for a period of one or two years. Unlike ordinary disability insurance -- under which payments are made to the policyholder -- a mortgage disability insurance policy will typically provide that payments be made directly to the mortgage holder.
The cost of such coverage, he said, depends on the size of the monthly mortgage payment and the age and health of the policyholder. On average, Mr. Steppat said, monthly premiums amount to about five percent of the mortgage payment.
Another form of mortgage payment insurance provides protection against the loss of a job.
"There are some products out there called involuntary unemployment insurance policies," Mr. Steppat said. Such policies, which provide for mortgage payments during a specified period of unemployment -- caused by dismissal or layoff, not by resignation -- typically cost more than disability policies and often impose a waiting period of up to a few months before payments start.
Both forms of coverage, he said, are typically offered through direct marketing channels -- either by mail or telephone solicitation -- and through individual mortgage lenders.

HEADLINE: FROM THE DESK OF;
Getting My Two Cents In Corporate America

BYLINE: By WILLIAM DORNBURGH; William Dornburgh is a former associate professor of economics at St. Peter's College in Jersey City.

 BODY:
THE big-ticket business decisions -- the downsizing, the optimizing, the cost-cutting, the mega-mergers-- are all quantified in terms of multimillions, if not billions, of dollars. In this age of deal-making and the computer, no one cares too much about what happens to the right of the decimal point.
Still, we like to think that common sense is a reasonable criterion in financial matters, that there should be some correlation between, say, the cost of a transaction and its underlying value. 
 Alas, this is not always the case, as I discovered recently as I was preparing for retirement and a move from New Jersey by making certain financial adjustments.
I wrote to the First Chicago Trust Company of New York to advise it that I was ending my participation in one of the dividend reinvestment plans it administered. I soon received a stock certificate for the accumulated shares in my account.
In a separate envelope, I received a check for 18 cents, compensating me for the 0.005 share that remained in my account. With some embarrassment, I deposited it into my bank account. After all, if First Chicago was going to go to the trouble of spending 32 cents on postage to send me 18 cents, the least I could do was to accept its generosity.
Of course, it cost more than 32 cents to send me that check. The banking system had to clear it through my bank in North Carolina -- where I spend my winters -- and through the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and New York and finally back to First Chicago. Still, 18 cents is 18 cents.
I also had an I.R.A. investment management account, consisting of government bonds, at United Jersey Bank, which I decided to consolidate with an individual retirement account at T. Rowe Price. Following my instructions, United Jersey sent me a check for the account balance, payable to T. Rowe Price as custodian for my I.R.A. A couple weeks later, United Jersey sent me another check, payable to T. Rowe Price, representing accumulated interest on the bond account. The amount: 2 cents.
Thinking T. Rowe Price might be a bit sticky about accepting such an investment, I decided not to forward the 2-cent check. Instead, I had it framed, at a cost of $15.
When I left my home in New Jersey, I dutifully paid all my obligations to vendors and utilities, including what I thought was a final bill from Bell Atlantic.
But the next month, Bell Atlantic sent me a bill for 19 cents. While I am scrupulously honest, I am also frugal and saw no reason for burdening the banking system with a check for 19 cents. Consequently, I taped two dimes to the Bell Atlantic invoice. With my usual magnanimity, I wrote across the invoice, "Keep the change."
You guessed it. A couple weeks later, I received a check from Bell Atlantic for 1 cent. I still haven't decided whether I should spring for another $15 frame.

HEADLINE: A Grungy Shocker on Heroin Comes Ashore

BYLINE: By MICHAEL DWYER; Michael Dwyer is the film correspondent of The Irish Times.

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
A FEW WEEKS AGO THE PARTnership for a Drug-Free America introduced its first national campaign aimed at fighting heroin. "You have a whole new group of young people who don't know the terror, the horror, the tragedy of heroin," explained Richard D. Bonnette, president of the organization.
Will they learn from "Trainspotting," the much-talked-about new British film opening in the United States on Friday? At one point in the movie, a junkie rhapsodizes about heroin: "Take the best orgasm you've ever had, multiply it by a thousand, and you're still nowhere near." 
 Though the film also goes on to show one character dying of AIDS and another quitting drugs cold turkey, it never does condemn heroin abuse. When you're off heroin, says Renton (played by Ewan McGregor), the addict who has sung its praises, "you have to worry about bills, about food, about some football team that never . . . wins, about human relationships and all the things that really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit."
The film, which opened in England in February, has become a phenomenon, its content inspiring heated debate about post-Thatcherite slackers and their aimlessness. The film's anti-Masterpiece-Theater style has spawned a popular soundtrack album by Blur, Lou Reed, Primal Scream and Iggy Pop, among others. And, because of its louche look, the film has inspired ads for sneakers, clothing and other movies.
The question is whether "Trainspotting" will have the same kind of impact in the United States, where the film has already received a lot of advance publicity, just as "Kids" did last year, when audiences were primed to rush out to see a movie about American drug-taking teen-agers that was heralded as the end of Western civilization. (Audiences instead chose to go see "Die Hard With a Vengeance," again.)
Will Americans identify with a film full of Scottish slang? A film that -- no matter how charming or rude -- at one point assumes a familiarity with the importance of Archie Gemmill's soccer goal against Holland in 1978?
"Trainspotting" portrays a group of Edinburgh friends with names like Renton, Sick Boy, Spud and Begbie who steal, take drugs (and try not to take drugs), struggle not to become employed, play and watch soccer, drink, pick up girls (one of them seriously under age), descend into Edinburgh's sewers to retrieve some opium and discuss the films of Sean Connery.
The movie has not only climbed to the No. 3 spot in all-time earnings for a film made and financed in Britain but has inspired a storm of protests on one hand and won rabid fans on the other. Its grim tone has invited comparisons to another work of British pop nihilism, the 1971 Stanley Kubrick film "A Clockwork Orange," in large part because of Renton's narration: a rapid-fire monologue full of vulgarisms and delivered in a Scottish brogue so thick, some of it had to be rerecorded for the American release. (A sample: "Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a [expletive] big television, choose washing machines, cars, compact disk players and electrical tin openers.")
The phenomenon that became "Trainspotting" began in 1993 with the publication of a novel of the same name by Irvine Welsh about heroin addicts in an economically depressed Scotland. (In the 80's, Edinburgh became what John Arlidge, a newspaper columnist at the London-based Independent, called "the heroin and AIDS capital of Europe.") The novel became a cult hit and inspired a successful stage play on the West End and elsewhere. The title, which is ironic and derogatory, refers to a British hobby of collecting locomotive numbers off passing trains, and, in the context of the film, suggests a life bereft of purpose.
To write the script, John Hodge, a soft-spoken 31-year-old doctor, returned to the book, a collection of loosely related stories that he originally thought could never be made into a movie. His solution was to pull the book apart, meld some characters, invent others and rely heavily on voice-overs to provide the interior monologues.
"Trainspotting" is the second movie from the director Danny Boyle, the producer Andrew Macdonald and Mr. Hodge, the team whose previous movie was the dark Scottish comedy "Shallow Grave." It was Mr. Macdonald, whose grandfather was the renowned producer and director Emeric Pressburger, who decided that they should adapt Mr. Welsh's novel to the screen.
"After the success of 'Shallow Grave' we received any number of offers from Hollywood," Mr. Macdonald said as he and his two colleagues sat, casually dressed, in the very formal St. James's Club here. "But we thought it was more important to stay in Britain and make another contemporary film. The only thing we had to do was to keep it relatively cheap, so we could keep control over it." The movie, shot in less than two months, cost only $2.5 million.
Mr. Boyle, a young-looking 39, and his team researched the film by meeting heroin users in the Edinburgh suburb of Leith, where the story is set, and by meeting former addicts at the Calton Athletic Drug Rehabilitation Center in Glasgow. "I always think that art tries to catch up with life," he says, "and occasionally a book like 'Trainspotting' comes along, which tries to view the experience from the inside."

IN WORKING ON THE FILM, MR. Boyle said, he came to realize that for people inside the drug world, "it becomes about survival, about getting on and getting what you want, whether it be a fix or a girl or whatever."
"You have to deal with that," he added. "You can't just take the old position of 'You touch drugs, you die. They will damage you.' In the long run, of course, there's probably terrible damage waiting."
The dizzying pace of the movie is set in the opening scene. The camera follows store detectives as they chase Renton and a friend through the streets while Iggy Pop's "Lust for Life" pumps up the soundtrack. Mr. McGregor, who stars in the film, had previously played the journalist in "Shallow Grave" and turns up next month as Frank Churchill in the period film "Emma."
While many British films, like those of Ken Loach, embrace a form of social realism, "Trainspotting" favors the surreal: set pieces attempt to show what addicts feel when they overdose (a carpet seems to open up like a grave) and when they go through withdrawal (babies seem to crawl on the ceiling).
The film's boys-will-be-boys attitude might never have survived if the picture had been backed by a commercial studio. The "big decision," Mr. Macdonald said, was to let the adventurous television network Channel 4 finance the film.
"We worked so well as a team with them on 'Shallow Grave,' " he said. "If we had been involved with a more commercial backer like Miramax or Polygram, it would have been a lot more difficult, I think, and would involve a lot of compromises." Miramax is distributing the film in the United States.
In the end, the film makers say they did not make any compromises, and that may be why the movie touched a nerve in Britain, with commentary spilling over from the entertainment pages to the opinion columns. The Daily Mail, for example, condemned the film's "irresponsible, lofty refusal to judge or condemn" heroin addiction.
Mr. Hodge disagrees. "The film doesn't condone drug taking," he insisted. "It just accepts bounds of reality. I think it's a responsible film because it shows what goes wrong if you take heroin."
"There's so much hypocrisy," he went on. "People are quite happy to ignore the damage that alcohol does. In the film, Begbie is the most dangerous, and his drug is alcohol. We've all had the misfortune to sit on the train next to someone like Begbie."
Mr. Boyle also rejects criticism of "Trainspotting." "I just thought the book was an amazing experience," he said. "People say it's about heroin, but like all great books, it's actually about how complex humanity is, and how we just evade definition."
Writing in The Times of London, the columnist Magnus Linklater suggested that the "starkest message emerging from the 'Trainspotting' phenomenon is the rift it reveals between the generations on the subject of drugs and their insidious appeal." Young audiences accept it as a genuine portrayal of life in the raw, he said, while most of their elders are appalled.
To date, "Trainspotting" has taken in more than $18 million at the box office in Britain, a remarkable achievement in view of the fact that the film's rating denies admission to anyone under 18. Of the British-made films, only "Four Weddings and a Funeral," which has taken in $40 million, and "A Fish Called Wanda," with $20 million, have been more popular.
Next, Mr. Boyle, Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Hodge will collaborate on a romantic comedy adventure called "A Life Less Ordinary," about a Scottish cleaning man who loses his job when he is replaced by an automatic vacuum cleaner. "There are no drugs involved," Mr. Hodge promised.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/39 and 41 Commerce Street;
Two 1830's Homes, and a Garden Big Enough for a 3d

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THE rain leaks into the house at 41 Commerce Street through loose mortar, peeling paint and holes in the roof -- indeed, it looks as if little has been done since 1832, when the structure was built as one of a curious pair with 39 Commerce Street. Now the owner is spending $60,000 on the little building, but if things go right, a passer-by won't be able to tell the difference.
In 1830 Peter Huyler of Hackensack, N.J., bought the end of the block that was created as Commerce Street turned north to meet Barrow Street. And in 1832, as the former suburb of Greenwich Village was being absorbed by the larger city, Huyler built the two houses that now stand at 39 and 41 Commerce Street. 
 Early tax and building records indicate that the original houses were two-and-a-half stories high, with dormers in a peaked roof, a typical model for structures of the period.
What is unusual about 39 and 41 Commerce Street is the large garden they share. The blockfront is 72 feet long, but the houses take up only 45 of those feet, and the garden space could have easily accommodated a third house. Although both houses now have their main doorways facing the garden, early photographs and plans show that the original doorways faced the street and that there were few windows on the garden.
There are several popular explanations for this unusual pair of houses, the most common of which is that Huyler built them for his two sisters -- a story for which no evidence exists. And yet the garden seems so generous, in relation to the rest of the city, it invites such mythology. The answer, however, may lie in how the city itself has changed.
Maps and other records indicate that most of the houses on the block had small adjacent plots -- it was, after all, still part suburb. So the gardens seem prominent only in the context of later, more intensive rowhouse development of the city.
Huyler never lived in New York, but he did not sell the buildings -- he held them for rental. Regina Kellerman, an expert on 19th-century New York, says that building for long-term investment was common in the West Village. The first identifiable tenant at 41 Commerce Street was Peter Burdett, who moved there in 1842; at 39 Commerce it was William Halsey, described in directories as a "captain," who moved there in 1848.
In 1873 the Huyler heirs had the architect Daniel T. Atwood alter the roofs of both 39 and 41 Commerce, creating a full third story under a slate mansard roof. The Huylers sold 39 Commerce in 1877, and No. 41 in 1899. The 1900 census shows a family of six and two boarders in No. 39, and a family of four with six boarders in No. 41. The six included a Mary Moody, 30, who made umbrellas.
A 1905 photograph at the New-York Historical Society shows 41 with its Commerce Street doorway, heavily shuttered windows -- perhaps because of the summer heat -- and a solid board fence along the garden.
The doorways were moved to the garden fronts at some point before 1932, when a city survey shows the present arrangement, along with a skylight in the top floor of 41. Although census records in the 1920's show occupants of the houses with jobs like baker, laborer and teamster, the new popularity of the village soon brought tenants like Mabel Swerig, a librarian, at No. 39 and D'Arcy Dahlberg, an artist, at 41.
Both buildings had been divided into four apartments each by that time, but in 1948 a new owner of No. 41, James G. Lambrakis, combined the four apartments to create a private house. No. 39, however, has remained divided. In 1969 the Landmarks Preservation Commission included the entire area in the Greenwich Village Historic District.
Although No. 39 has been spruced up in the recent past, No. 41 could be an Edward Hopper painting. The mansard is spotted with tar, there are holes its cornice and sheet-metal window surrounds. On the first two floors, the pointing on the brick crumbles with a pass of a finger, and ancient paint curls up off the brick like the cracked surface of a bone-dry mud flat.
This year a new owner, Ruth Scheuer, retained the architect Richard Ayotte to stop a growing number of leaks in the house. His mission is not to remove but to somehow preserve the peeling paint.
"The owner bought an old house, and she wants an old house," Mr. Ayotte said, pointing to an ancient "Ball Playing Not Allowed" sign, almost completely rusted away, that he will keep intact.
Looking across the street at a recently restored 1880's flat building, 68 Barrow Street, Mr. Ayotte said, "You can't tell if that was built last year, or 100 years ago." At 41 Commerce Street, Mr. Ayotte will repoint the brick and replace the slate and galvanized iron roof trim; otherwise, his work will be invisible.

REFLECTIONS OF A COLD WARRIOR
 From Yalta to the Bay of Pigs.
 By Richard M. Bissell Jr. with Jonathan E. Lewis and Frances T. Pudlo.
 268 pp. New Haven:
 Yale University Press. $30. 
 Dean Acheson was against the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency. In July 1947, he warned Harry Truman that once it was established neither the President "nor anyone else would be in a position to know what it was doing or to control it." But in the spirit of the times, which were driven by an obsession with national security, the agency came into being. A year later, at the suggestion of George Kennan, an office was created to send agents into the field -- not simply to discover the intentions of foreign governments but also, if need be, to intervene covertly in their domestic affairs.
Such "covert ops" became especially useful during the Eisenhower Administration. They were cheaper than direct military intervention and, so it seemed, successful in advancing Washington's goal of global containment of Communism. John F. Kennedy increased spending on conventional forces to allow for greater flexibility, but the emphasis on covert operations, and its stepchild, counterinsurgency, prospered -- even though it led to the greatest humiliation suffered by the Kennedy Administration, the slaughter of C.I.A.-financed Cuban exile guerrillas on the swampy shores of the Bay of Pigs.
The man who eventually took charge of covert operations -- arguably the most intellectually gifted of any of the C.I.A. operatives -- was Richard M. Bissell Jr. (1909-94). "Reflections of a Cold Warrior" is his story (written with the assistance of Jonathan E. Lewis and Frances T. Pudlo). Like many of the early gung-ho spymasters who helped run the agency in the halcyon era of the 1950's, Bissell came from a privileged background -- the Groton School, Yale University. He remained at Yale to receive a Ph.D. and to teach Keynesian economics; he counted among his most outstanding students the Bundy brothers, William and McGeorge, and the Rostow brothers, Eugene and Walt.
But service in World War II changed everything for him -- as it did for many of his gifted students. The feeling of power and purpose that young men experienced in the mortal struggle against fascism and totalitarianism was not easily shed. And when the advent of the cold war sounded another call to action, Richard Bissell heard the trumpet. He went to Washington to help write the Marshall Plan, and in 1954 he joined the operatives around the avuncular, pipe-smoking Allen Dulles, the Director of Central Intelligence, whose exploits as a wartime spy and taste for derring-do rivaled James Bond's.
As assistant to the director, Bissell soon became involved in a covert operation designed to overthrow the regime of the democratically elected President of Guatemala, Jacobo Arbenz Guzman. The Eisenhower Administration believed that Arbenz was a Communist tool and that an Arbenz alignment with Moscow would constitute, in Bissell's words, "a major threat to regional stability." Once Arbenz sought arms from the Soviet bloc the way was open for Dwight D. Eisenhower's operatives to topple him.
In a plot worthy of a Woody Allen movie, the C.I.A. used broadcasts into Guatemala to exaggerate the unimpressive military forces of an exiled former army officer named Carlos Castillo Armas, whom the agency had built up as an alternative to Arbenz. In addition, a small agency-run "rebel" air force was able to fly unopposed over Guatemalan territory, where it engaged in widespread bombing, often with little more than empty Coca-Cola bottles. But these few decrepit planes were not enough to bring down Arbenz, and Eisenhower, even at the risk of betraying the Administration's policy of "plausible deniability," made additional aircraft available for the rebel air force. In the end, the Arbenz regime collapsed.
At the time, Bissell hardly questioned the need to overthrow Arbenz. Yet the result has been decades of one of the most repressive regimes in Central America. In retrospect, he admits that "U.S. interests over the years might have been better served if Arbenz had remained in power." But then he concludes that because Washington had destabilized a democratically elected government, we had a great "moral obligation" to "try to do something about the underlying situation" in that country.
What that means is left unanswered. Should we have bought the country? Should we have attempted to convert Castillo Armas into a statesman? The real answer is not to overthrow a democratically elected government in the first place, no matter what its alignment, unless it poses a direct military threat to the United States.
In the aftermath of Guatemala, Bissell saw the need to develop a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft -- the U-2. As the man who brought this project to a successful conclusion, he deserves high marks. The U-2, with its ability to overfly territory without detection, provided valuable photographs of Soviet defenses. By 1960, the information it had gained had persuaded the Eisenhower Administration that the United States was not falling behind Russia in missile technology.
Unfortunately, as a kind of reward for this achievement, Bissell was put in charge of covert operations in 1959. In this capacity, he had the responsibility for explaining to President John F. Kennedy the Eisenhower Administration's plan for landing exiles on Cuba, where they were expected either to stimulate an uprising or to disappear into the mountains and become the nucleus of a guerrilla force that would ultimately overthrow Fidel Castro.
The story of the Bay of Pigs, as related by Bissell, is as disheartening as ever. Once again, the Rube Goldberg aspects of the plan are stunning: Cuban exiles, who had been trained in Guatemala (by now a friendly regime) and later in the Southern United States, were to touch ground on a beach known as the Bay of Pigs. Air support would be supplied from aging B-26's, flown by Cuban exile pilots. But the plan's success depended on air strikes against not only Fidel Castro's communications but also Cuba's small air force, to keep it from destroying the invaders. Although Kennedy acquiesced in the plan, he was a reluctant commander. At the last moment, he sharply reduced the number of air strikes -- largely to be able to conceal Washington's involvement -- and this doomed the landing force.
Unlike Eisenhower, who had been willing to supply the extra aircraft when the Guatemalan operation was in danger of collapse, Kennedy backed off. It simply never occurred to Bissell that when the chips were down, Kennedy would not come through with the needed air support. It was, after all, the longest of long shots that 1,000 exile soldiers were going to be able to overwhelm some 200,000 members of Cuba's armed forces.
The failure was absolute. The exile army was destroyed. The mountains they were supposed to hide in were some 80 miles away from the beaches, across a virtually impenetrable swamp. Kennedy was humiliated and, worst of all, he had just lost a round to Fidel Castro, which made him more determined than ever to get him.
Bissell was through. As he recalls, Kennedy told him: "If this were a parliamentary government, I would have to resign and you, a civil servant, would stay on. But being the system of government it is, a Presidential government, you will have to resign." Eventually, Bissell left the Government to work in the private sector, and to ponder the role of the C.I.A.
In his meticulous but unexciting prose, he concludes that covert action is compatible with democracy. Yet it is hard to see where the C.I.A.'s so-called successes in this field did not eventually turn into malevolent ghosts that ended up causing more lethal problems for us than the original difficulties.
After the failure of the Bay of Pigs, that supreme realist, Walter Lippmann, stated an enduring truth about the making of an effective American foreign policy: "A policy is bound to fail which deliberately violates our pledges and our principles, our treaties and our laws." He reminded us then -- and it is a good thing to be reminded once again -- that "the American conscience is a reality. It will make hesitant and ineffectual, even if it does not prevent, an un-American policy."

 Bordering on Chaos
 Guerrillas, Stockbrokers, Politicians,
 and Mexico's Road to Prosperity.
 By Andres Oppenheimer.
 Illustrated. 367 pp. New York:
 Little, Brown & Company. $25.95. 
 Pity the journalist who covers Mexico. In 1992, the year Andres Oppenheimer started research for this book, our southern neighbor was an international darling. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, saluted for opening his country's markets to foreign goods and arranging to repay its foreign debt, was a model, we were told, for any leader trying to nudge a weak economy up into the ranks of the first world. But as Mr. Oppenheimer's title hints, early on in his writing all kinds of catastrophe struck, and what had begun as an inquiry into the Government's success soon came to feel like an inquest into its failure.
To recap the disasters: On New Year's Day, 1994, ski-masked guerrillas led an uprising in the destitute southern state of Chiapas. Later that same year, as Mr. Salinas's term in office wound down, the presidential candidate and the congressional leader of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, were assassinated, and in December, three weeks after a new president, Ernesto Zedillo, took over, the currency collapsed. The emperor had turned out to be not only naked but rashly misguided in policy and quite probably corrupt. In February 1995 Mr. Salinas, by now a figure of scandal, ducked out of the country under cover.
It's been a grotesquely eventful period -- a few years as unsettling, in their own way, as the late 1960's in the United States -- so that covering it all is rather like trying to sum up shockers in this country as disparate as the Watts riots, Charles Manson and the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In "Bordering on Chaos," Mr. Oppenheimer, a correspondent for The Miami Herald, attacks each issue with the confident common sense and sometimes -- though this may be inevitable in a book tackling current events so soon after they occurred -- the rushed generality of a daily reporter.
Topic No. 1 is the Chiapas uprising, a story he believes most American journalists naively mishandled. The Zapatistas' articulate green-eyed leader, Subcommander Marcos (Rafael Guillen), seduced the foreign press into believing that the movement was an innovative "post-modern" attempt to better the lot of Mayan Indians, whose grievances are indeed legitimate. But Mr. Oppenheimer demonstrates (though he is certainly not the first to do so) that the rebellion was led by a club of intellectuals trained in the same stale, intransigent Marxist dogma that has tied up the Latin American left for decades.
As for the two recent assassinations of PRI leaders, Mr. Oppenheimer speculates that both internal party warfare and drug trafficking may have played a role. But he disagrees with the theory favored by Mexican and American academics (and, again, often uncritically accepted by American journalists) that the fighting inside the PRI represents an ideological split between the so-called dinosaurs (the corrupt old guard) and younger free-market reformers. According to Mr. Oppenheimer the chaos is nothing more grand than a jostling for turf. The real problem is that the PRI has held power for more than seven decades and its leaders, always corrupt, have lately become reckless and hubristic. He likens the situation to hereditary decay, as when a royal house, after centuries of inbreeding, starts giving birth to deformed and even insane heirs.
Mexico's greatest hope, Mr. Oppenheimer believes, is for President Zedillo to quit the PRI altogether and start over with a new, more democratic party. Barring such a courageous move, he sees promise in the entrepreneurial, self-sufficient spirit of the National Action Party, or PAN, a right-wing party of middle-class, industrial and Roman Catholic interests that has recently gained a few governorships in the north. But he cautions that some kind of safety net needs to be extended to the poorer south to head off future disasters like Chiapas.
A persistent theme, and Mr. Oppenheimer's most useful point, is that despite all the recent turmoil, Mexicans are not the hot-blooded potential revolutionaries many Americans have assumed them to be. According to pollsters, their biggest worry is unemployment; in one poll asking them to name their most personally pressing concern, he notes, "the Zapatista rebellion ranked lower than traffic jams."
SUCH results are a necessary reminder of who Mexicans are not, but one sometimes wishes Mr. Oppenheimer could bring us closer to who they are than multiple-choice answers to a survey. Again and again he has to concede that Mexico tends to stump conventional American journalism. In the Chiapas jungle, hoping for access to Subcommander Marcos, he bribed a young guerrilla liaison with cigarettes, crackers and T-shirts, only to discover that the boy was not a guerrilla at all but an impostor and a thief. A PRI senator, after giving a detailed inside account of a scandalous 1994 meeting of Mexican moguls (where he claimed Mr. Salinas requested that they donate $25 million each to the party), published a book essentially saying of his revelations, "Just kidding."
Stopping to untangle a conspiracy theory that certain Zapatista rebels are actually Government agents and a rumor that President Zedillo is not exactly who he claims to be but the son of a mysterious man who drifted out of the picture when he was a child, Mr. Oppenheimer throws up his hands. "I was, as most journalists in Mexico often are, at a total loss. . . . Were the Zapatistas real Zapatistas? Was Zedillo a true Zedillo? How could one write about a country where one could not only not trust what people said, but wasn't even sure whether people were who they were supposed to be? Studying Mexico, as one U.S. academic had once told me, was like working in Plato's cave: you only saw shadows and never knew which shadow belonged to whom." As useful as Mr. Oppenheimer's summary is, in the end it is these moments of bewilderment, more than any single insight, that stand out. For now, it seems, we're still looking at shadows.

THE REMEDY
 Class, Race, and Affirmative Action.
 By Richard D. Kahlenberg.
 350 pp. New York:

 In the face of growing attacks on programs of racial preference, some analysts have called for a shift from an affirmative action policy based on race to one based on economic class or need. Richard D. Kahlenberg's book "The Remedy: Class, Race, and Affirmative Action" is by far the most comprehensive and thoughtful argument thus far for that position. Mr. Kahlenberg, a fellow at the Center for National Policy in Washington, strongly supports antidiscrimination laws, like the 1964 and 1991 civil rights acts, to fight race and sex discrimination. He is also in favor of the noncontroversial traditional approach to affirmative action: enlarging the applicant pool so that women and members of minority groups are not excluded from consideration by the workings of the old-boy network. But he feels that preferences in hiring or admissions should benefit only the economically disadvantaged, regardless of race, ethnicity, sex or sexual orientation.
Racial preferences, Mr. Kahlenberg maintains, were not part of the original national affirmative action policy designed by the Johnson Administration. Rather, affirmative action, combined with antidiscrimination initiatives, was conceived as a program of social mobility "to insure that members of all races had a fair chance to compete." Nor did Martin Luther King Jr. or Robert F. Kennedy ever endorse racial preferences. Indeed, in the middle to late 1960's, thoughtful and progressive advocates of racial equality reached two basic conclusions: to overcome the legacy of previous discrimination, it was necessary to move beyond the formal equality of opportunity embodied in the civil rights act; and compensatory programs to achieve racial justice had to involve the disadvantaged of all races.
In 1968, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy were assassinated and Lyndon B. Johnson served his last year as President. King, Kennedy and Johnson viewed compensation for African-Americans as part of a broader and more ambitious effort to promote a Great Society of genuine equal opportunity, color-blindness and integration; after their departure, civil rights thinking dramatically shifted, in two ways. The first, Mr. Kahlenberg writes, "focused on a narrow zero-sum effort, pitting the very groups King had sought to unite against each other and following a theory of compensation that many Americans refuse to accept." The second, which emerged in the late 70's, subtly shifted the justification for affirmative action from compensation to diversity -- "from racial preferences as a temporary bridge to color-blindness to racial preferences as a permanent way of life."
Mr. Kahlenberg feels that the first approach often does not help disadvantaged applicants because if the goal is equality of group result, a child of a black Supreme Court Justice would tend to be preferred over the child of a white Appalachian miner. And since the second approach rests solely on the notion of social utility rather than on past wrongs, it "often benefits groups that have never been discriminated against (WASP's) and hurts groups that have (Asians, Jews and homosexuals)."
For Mr. Kahlenberg, only an affirmative action based on class would correct for society's injustice and provide genuine individual equal opportunity. While eliminating benefits for advantaged minorities, it would enhance benefits for both poor people of color and poor whites. Moreover, class-based affirmative action programs would hasten racial integration, "but without the increased racial prejudice and hostility associated with racial preferences."
Mr. Kahlenberg has clearly done his homework, and in laying out his argument he draws on the work of many analysts in the field, including my own. He asserts, correctly, that blacks would benefit disproportionately from an affirmative action based on class because "as a group" they are "more disadvantaged than whites." I would argue, though, that the shift could actually result in the systematic exclusion of many middle-income blacks from desirable positions because conventional measures of performance are not sensitive to the cumulative effects of race. By this I mean having one's chances in life limited by race, regardless of class, because of the effects of living in segregated neighborhoods -- that is, being exposed to styles of behavior, habits and the particular skills that emerge from patterns of racial exclusion -- because of the quality of de facto segregated schooling and because of nurturing by parents whose experiences have also been shaped and limited by race.
Thus, if we were to rely solely on the standard criteria for college admission, like S.A.T. scores, even many children from black middle-class families would be denied admission in favor of middle-class whites who are not weighed down by the accumulation of disadvantages that stem from racial restrictions and who therefore tend to score higher on these conventional measures. The extent to which standard aptitude tests like the S.A.T. and tests used for the promotion of police officers are measuring merit or real potential to succeed, not privilege, is not readily apparent.
Mr. Kahlenberg is fully aware that standardized tests fail to measure such important attributes as character, creativity and leadership. Nor do they predict who will become a good doctor, businessman or lawyer. "But until someone devises such tests," he states, "we are stuck with muddling along and doing the best we can."
Since race is one of the components of "disadvantaged," should not the ideal affirmative action program be based on class and race? Mr. Kahlenberg rejects this idea. In his formulation, class-based preferences are designed to replace, not supplement, race-based preferences, except in those rare cases where racial remedies address the problem of documented injury due to discrimination. He would probably argue that the complex calculus of disadvantage he would use to determine class eligiblity for affirmative action addresses the problem of the cumulative effects of race. This calculus includes not only parental income, occupation and education but net worth, family structure, the quality of secondary education and neighborhood influences. Although the use of this more complex calculus would increase the proportion of African-Americans in the pool, it would still result in the systematic exclusion of many of those blacks from middle-income families who are nevertheless still suffering the cumulative effects of race. This could create a situation in which, for example, African-Americans who are admitted to Harvard represent the bottom half of the socioeconomic continuum in the black community, while those who are above the median are excluded, because they no longer fall within the affirmative action pool. They are therefore left to compete with middle- and upper-income whites who are not burdened by the handicaps of race -- as their higher scores on the conventional tests reflect.
Finally, Mr. Kahlenberg is very sensitive to the political problem that whites are overwhelmingly opposed to the standard race-based affirmative action. But it should be pointed out that some race-based programs are supported by a substantial majority of the white population. While they oppose "preferential" racial policies like college admission quotas or job hiring and promotion strategies designed to achieve certain numerical outcomes, most white Americans, according to recent studies, approve of "compensatory" affirmative action programs, like race-targeted programs of job training, special education, special scholarships for black students who maintain good grades in school, and special recruitment efforts.
It would not be a leap of faith, therefore, to assume that a strong and convincing case could be made for a program of class- and race-based affirmative action. Such a program would feature a broad definition of disadvantage, couched in language that promotes the notion of enhancing opportunity, not the narrow racial preference discussed in this book.

HEADLINE: Paying Their Own Way

BYLINE: By BRIAN HANSON-HARDING 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
RAYMOND MAKORI, 19, has his eye on a car, a sporty used Mitsubishi Starion. So at 3 P.M. five times a week -- more often, if he can get the overtime -- he takes a bus from his home here to the gatehouse at the sprawling Panasonic headquarters in Secaucus to begin an eight-hour shift as a security guard.
There would be nothing unusual about Raymond's $6-an-hour job, or his dream of new wheels, if it were not for the way he plans to use them. "I need a car so I can get a second job on weekends," he said the other day. "I have to pay part of the household bills and the rent." And he has to pay nearly $3,000 a year for tuition (and help pay it for his younger brother and sisters) at St. Aloysius High School in Jersey City, where he will be a senior in the fall. 
 Raymond Makori, a tall, polite, soft-spoken young man who emigrated from Kenya just this year, is one of a growing number of urban students who not only attend Catholic school but also pay their own way. Of the 3,000 students at Jersey City's seven parochial high schools, the poorest thousand or so go to three -- St. Aloysius, St. Anthony's and St. Mary's -- where the tuition is less than $3,000 a year, low enough to be within reach of a teen-ager who earns money flipping burgers or selling clothes at the mall.
Adults at these schools say perhaps a quarter of the students are paying some or all of their tuition. "It used to be that a few kids worked to buy nice clothes or luxuries," said Robert Gleeson, a longtime math teacher at St. Al's. "Now they're working out of necessity."
Catholic school officials in other cities are noticing a similar phenomenon. "Our students who live in Trenton will do literally anything to go to this school," said Joseph Lemme, principal of McCorristin Catholic High School, where at least 5 percent of the students depend on their own income to pay tuition.
Why they do it -- why they work long hours, often at great cost to their social lives, their grades and even their health, to get an education they could get at no cost in public school -- is a question packed with implications about the lives of the students, their families and the cities themselves.
For the students, parochial school keeps them out of a world they see as too large, too anonymous, riddled with gangs and peer pressure. They say they need the structure and discipline of Catholic school to succeed.
"In public school you find people taking drugs," said Raymond Makori, sounding almost apologetic. "It's safer in private Catholic schools." said Raymond Makori, sounding almost apologetic. "It's safer in private Catholic schools."
Often it is pressure from parents and from cultures that motivates students to pay for a Catholic education -- an education that in Jersey City includes one mandatory religion course per year, plus prayers at the beginning of each day and each class. In many immigrant families, especially Hispanic ones, an older sister is expected to sacrifice herself to pay for the education of a younger brother, said Peggy Orenstein, author of "Schoolgirls: Women, Self-Esteem and the Confidence Gap" (Doubleday, 1994).
"There's a big expectation from the outside world that they will get pregnant and drop out," she said. "It can seem as a responsible, affirming thing if you're bringing in money and sending a little sibling to school."
Whatever the reasons, it is clear that more and more students are taking this route to an education. "When I first came here, there really wasn't any student who had to pay his or her own tuition," said Nancy Heymer, a guidance counselor at St. Aloysius. "It's been steadily increasing over the 14 years I've been here."
This is no surprise to Bret Schundler, the Mayor of Jersey City, who for years has crusaded for a voucher plan that would make it easier for poor students to attend parochial or private school. "Kids will work to stay in an environment that is safe and where they're able to learn," he said. "In contrast, public schools have a philosophy based on egalitarianism. They have a school culture based on anti-elitism. They say anti-elitism, I say anti-excellence."
People who work and learn in the public schools, of course, reject such generalizations. The idea that students get away with anything they want is "simply untrue," said Tom Favia, president of the teachers' union, the Jersey City Education Association. And Smita Patel, a junior at Dickinson High School in Jersey City, scoffed at the notion that public schools have some sort of monopoly on fear, violence, gangs and drugs.
"There's peer pressure everywhere," she said. "Part of the point of going to school is to learn to distinguish right from wrong. If you're careful, if you don't associate with people who cause trouble, you'll be all right."
Still, even public school defenders say the Catholic schools have some built-in advantages. While "there are some very excellent people coming out of Jersey City's public schools," said Ed Richardson, a spokesman for the New Jersey Education Association, "nonpublic schools can pick and choose whom they want to educate." Mary Murphy, principal of Our Lady of Good Counsel High School in Newark, acknowledged, "We are able to provide a safer, smaller environment because we can pick and choose our students."
What follow are the stories of several who were chosen, and who chose to pay their own way.
 
MIGUEL SANTOS
The Pull of the Gang
Ask Miguel Santos why it was so important to go to St. Aloysius that he worked more than 32 hours a week to pay the tuition, and he stares at the burn scar he got as a member of the Visaya Boys gang.
"In public school, I think I would have dropped out, ended up selling drugs," said Miguel, 18, the son of a Guatemalan political refugee. "At St. Al's, they call your house; they make sure you're in school."
Of his five best friends who attended Dickinson (not to mention the 65 members of the gang), he was the only one who finished high school and was accepted to college; he is attending the Educational Opportunity Fund summer program at Montclair State College, where he was accepted for the fall term. "I'm the only one in the gang who made it this far," he said.
Going to Catholic school through eighth grade did not keep Miguel out of gangs or out of trouble. But when his parents had to economize by sending him to public school for his freshman year, Jersey City became for him a landscape of "safe" and "hostile" zones, defined by his gang affiliation. Afraid of trouble with rival factions at his local high school, Lincoln, he tried to move in with a friend in order to go to Dickinson, a school of 2,600 students in Jersey City Heights, where his gang was based.
"My mom saw that," he said, "and she decided to go halves with my older sister, Erica, to pay for my tuition" at St. Aloysius in December of that year.
Going to St. Al's, a parochial school of 300 students on a gritty but bustling commercial block downtown, was "like coming home," he said. "I had a safe learning environment. When I went to Lincoln, the little while that I did go, kids would scream, they would smoke marijuana in the hallways and the bathrooms. You would never find that in here."
Still, the pull of the gang was strong. And when he met his gang buddies after school each day, they would tease him about his school uniform. "My friends used to say, 'You're a crossover, you're a pretty boy, you're a prepster.' "
At the end of his freshman year, his mother learned that he planned to run away to live with a friend and go to Dickinson to be with his gang. "When I came back to pick up my report card, she was waiting for me outside. The next day, she put me on a plane for Guatemala to live with relatives."
When he got back at the end of the summer, his parents insisted he act more responsibly and pay his tuition at St. Al's. So he got a job working 31 hours a week at a Waldbaum's supermarket in the Newport Plaza strip mall, where he started as a cart boy earning $5.05 an hour and over three years moved up to cashier and assistant runner, at a dollar an hour more. Miguel gradually drifted away from the gang and toward a new group of friends who earned money as D.J.'s at parties in New York, and he would help out, earning $60 a party.
At first he thought paying for school wasn't worth it. "I'd have way more fun at Dickinson," he said. "But at the same time, I still had a lot of close friends here. They weren't into gangs. They really kept me into school a lot."
So Miguel Santos scraped by. With a final average of 79, he was accepted to Montclair State College and hopes to study law. He credits the school: "The teachers made the difference." But he also thinks working his way through school helped.
"I pay to be here," he said. "If I don't take advantage of the opportunity, I waste all my money."

ANDREA DOUGLAS
In Bed by 3
 Working to pay tuition since age 14 has certainly taught responsibility to Andrea Douglas, a quiet, serious St. Al's student bound for Douglass College. "If I went to public school, I wouldn't care if I got a C," she said. "Now if I get a C, I get a heart attack."
Even though her mother's night job at the post office was barely enough to support Andrea and her two brothers, she wanted to avoid the public Snyder High School. "There were drug transactions going on right in front of the school," she said. So she got a job working 20 to 25 hours a week at a clothing store in the Hudson Mall in Jersey City to help pay tuition.
Working that much sometimes made Andrea feel she was missing out. "The people who don't have to work are out partying," she said. "If you have to work, you can't have that fun."
The job takes its toll in other ways. "As soon as I get home, I have to wash up and get ready to go to work, so I'll be doing homework till 1 or 2 in the morning," she said. "I try to be in bed by 3 o' clock. If there's a hard test, I study the night before, but all the other studying I do in the morning, in homeroom, between classes."
Such grueling schedules can have physical effects. "You see their skin tone change," said Margaret Lanni, the director of guidance at St. Al's. "They're tired; they're not eating right; they don't keep themselves well." Mr. Gleeson, the longtime math teacher, said: "It's very difficult for them. I don't know how they do it, to be honest."
Working 30 hours a week stocking shelves at Shop Rite has had an effect on Miguel Valentin, 17, whose family rejected Ferris High School in favor of St. Mary's High School in downtown Jersey City.
"I come home tired," he said. "If I got a test the next day, I go to sleep and worry about it in the morning." While he got B's and C's his sophomore year, Miguel barely passed this year. And after slipping two months behind in his tuition, he couldn't afford to cut back on work.
And now there seems to be even less chance he can work fewer hours. After his sister was slashed in the face with a razor blade at school, his parents plan to put her in St. Mary's too.
Still, many adults who work with young people say that those who must work to pay their own tuition will probably do better in school. "Young people working for tuition are looking at the long term," said Alan Zuckerman, executive director of the National Youth Employment Coalition, a job-training research group in Washington. "When they do that, they're more motivated, and their chances of succeeding are greater."
Mr. Gleeson agreed. "Some of the best students are the ones who work," he said. "They get a feel for the real world, it shows them what they're up against, and it makes them want to study that much harder."
If Andrea Douglas's spirit ever flagged, she always had a cautionary tale in her best friend, a decent student during sophomore year at St. Al's, who began attending Dickinson in her junior year when her family could no longer afford tuition.
"She started worrying about her wardrobe, she wanted names -- Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Polo Ralph Lauren," Andrea said. "She was always cutting school to be with the crowd. After a while, she was flunking out of math, and nearly flunked the whole year."
She paused. "If I went to public school, I probably would have cut school with her."
 
DIGNORA AQUINO
Working, and Winning
 Eighteen-year-old Dignora Aquino is confident and well-spoken, and she has a sophistication born of working several years as a receptionist that makes her seem more like a teacher than a student.
"I knew that if I went to Dickinson, I wouldn't get out with good grades," said Dignora, the oldest of three children of Dominican immigrants. "I didn't want to get into all the peer pressure. There were four kids in my building who all graduated public grammar school together, and I'm the only one that graduated high school. If I hadn't gone to a parochial school, I probably would have ended up the way they did."
Dignora put herself through the last three years of high school completely on her own. "My father just refused to pay the tuition," she said. "He said, 'Just do it yourself.' "
And she does. She graduated fourth in her class last month and was accepted to St. Peter's College on a full scholarship; Michael Cunningham, her employer at Cunningham Graphics in Jersey City, called her "literally one of our best employees."
Next year, in addition to going to college full time, she intends to pay tuition at St. Al's for her youngest sister, Amabel.
At St. Al's, far more girls than boys are paying their own way. And when boys do get jobs, says Ms. Heymer, the longtime guidance counselor, there is a greater chance that they will assert their independence and cut school. (Miguel Santos, for instance, thought that since he was paying tuition, he could come and go as he pleased, and racked up more than 25 absences in his junior year.)
Families are more demanding of girls," Ms. Heymer said, "even to the point that the girls are almost accountable if the brothers don't behave or do well in school."
But when it comes down to choosing which sibling will go to parochial school, it will usually be the brother. "My parents thought that if I went to Ferris I'd hang out with the wrong crowd," said Miguel Valentin, a junior at St. Mary's. "They have more confidence in my sister."
Sometimes even the best students are caught between the pressures of work and school, their grades slipping. "They're afraid to speak to the boss because they need the job and are afraid of losing it," said Ms. Heymer. "They will not go and say, 'I have exams this week,' or 'I'm really working too many hours.' And sometimes it's their parents who are putting the extra pressure on them by counting on their income."
Working for high school tuition helps students become more mature and responsible, she went on. "But I think it still takes its toll on them, either academically or socially."
Of course, there are always the exceptions, like Dignora Aquino, who managed to work 35 to 40 hours a week, maintain high grades, and still go out dancing every Friday night. "Dignora is the absolute deviation from the norm," said Ms. Lanni, the guidance director. "She goes and goes and goes."
Next year, with a full scholarship to St. Peter's and free room and board in the dorm, she plans to hold down a full-time job.
"Anything in particular?" she was asked.
"I want to be a police officer. I've already passed the exam."

In Danbury, a Short Street That's Long on Hope

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

DATELINE: DANBURY

 BODY:
THE rehabilitation of a short street named for one of this city's notable natives, the late composer Charles Ives, has provided a focus for its effort to rejuvenate its downtown, which went into a sharp decline following the opening of the 1.5-million-square-foot Danbury Fair Mall in 1987.
Under the stewardship of its 43-year-old, four-term mayor, Gene F. Eriquez, the city committed itself seven years ago at the start of his first term to the creation of a downtown core of mixed uses and attractions within walking distance of one another. 
 Derelict, vacant buildings that lined the narrow, two-block Ives Street have been converted to restaurants, dance clubs and theme bars.
Ives Street's business owners have banded together in a promotional campaign, posting signs all over town pointing the way to the "Dining & Entertainment District," which eventually will cover the area bounded by Main, Liberty and White Streets and Patriot Drive.
The signs also appear on Interstate 84, directing motorists off the highway at Exit 5.
With an unemployment rate at 3.7 percent, a population that remains constant at 70,000, and a moderate tax rate of $19.13 per $1,000 of assessment, Danbury's economic health is almost robust. Its 11 million square feet of industrial space is 93 percent occupied, and 4 million square feet of office space has a vacancy rate under 15 percent, according to figures compiled by several local real estate offices.
Over the last four years the city spent $8 million downtown, building the 556-car Patriot Municipal Parking Garage, planting a town green where a crumbling parking lot once stood, upgrading the sewer and water systems and installing decorative street lighting, benches and paving.
Next on the agenda is Cityworks 2000, a proposed $14.9 million bond issue to enlarge City Hall by 25,000 square feet, renovate and enlarge the 40,000-square-foot public library by 4,000 square feet and update the computer, electrical and climate-control systems at Rogers and Broadview Middle Schools and Danbury High School.
Tom Devine, one of the entrepreneurs who has contributed to the revival of Ives Street, arrived 15 years ago to take a job as restaurant manager. Seven years later he leased a restaurant on Ives Street and went into business for himself as the owner of the Ciao Cafe.
"The city was starting to make improvements," he said. "They were putting in brick sidewalks, burying utility lines, and the banks were very supportive about lending money to new restaurants. Not a lot of people were investing in downtown Danbury then."
TWO months ago he paid $700,000 for a restaurant in a 1920's former firehouse across the street and reopened it as the Two Steps Downtown Grill.
The Hat City Alehouse, a four-month-old Ives Street bar, is a second establishment for Tom Kennedy, who also owns T.K.'s American Cafe in another part of the city. "We wanted to have something downtown because we saw what was going on here," he said.
The bar's walls are covered with old photographs of Danbury and its numerous hat factories, and dangling from the ceiling are Mallory, Lee, and Stetson hats, memorializing the industry that gave Danbury the name of Hat City.
Tuxedo Junction, a popular Ives Street nightclub, will soon be joined by Retro, whose parent company, Bopper's, has clubs in Waterbury and Stamford. Retro has leased a 6,500-square-foot building.
Included in the downtown mix is Liberty Terrace, a moderate-income housing development that opened in 1993.
Developed by the late George Davon, the 36 condominium apartments units of 1,100 to 1,250 square feet were sold for $78,000 to $98,000 to buyers who earned no more than $52,000 if single or a couple or $59,800 for a household of three or more.
The city has approved development of the largest indoor ice-skating center in the region on a vacant two-acre lot between Liberty Street and the Patriot Garage. Financial arrangements for the 85,000-square-foot complex, which is to be called the Western Connecticut Sportsplex and cost more than $8 million, are expected to be completed by the end of the month. It is expected to open late next year.
The developers are Goodfellow Ashmore Financial Group, a division of Goodfellow Ashmore Real Estate in partnership with Dr. Randolph Trowbridge, a local physician, and a recreation-center company that Todd Payne, owner of the real estate company, declined to name. The group plans an Olympic-sized rink for figure skating, a smaller rink for hockey, banks of lockers, food concessions and a second-floor video and entertainment center.
Central to the entertainment component is the proposed restoration of the 1929 Palace Theater on Main Street, which retained all but 180 of its 2,000 seats when it was converted to a triplex in 1992. The triplex was shuttered a year ago after Sony opened a 10-screen theater on Eagle Road off I-84.
"We hope to find a developer to bring it back as a performing arts center," said Mayor Eriquez. "We are looking to establish an arts organization to lease it with an option to buy."
One of its functions would be to provide a winter venue for the outdoor Charles Ives Performing Arts Center of Western Connecticut State University.
Within the last two months a newly built 14,000-square-foot Walgreen's opened on Main Street, adding to the service businesses, financial institutions and medical offices that have taken over former retail establishments, and the old Union Station re-opened as the Danbury Railway Museum after a 42-month, $2 million restoration.
The 17,000-square-foot depot, built in 1903 and surrounded by an additional 17,000 square feet of wood-canopied platforms, had been abandoned for 10 years. Its museum's exhibitions relate to the city's history and ecology and its gift shop is filled with railroad-related merchandise.
UNTIL a new Metro-North station -- under construction by the Connecticut Department of Transportation -- opens in October, the ticket window in the old depot will remain in operation. Late this summer a restaurant will open at the new station, created out of a 1940's dining car and club car that are being refurbished in the Danbury railroad yards by Paul Lamson and Harry Schuesner, both restaurateurs.
Much of what has been accomplished was done in a joint effort by the city and a group of downtown property owners who formed a special services taxing district in 1988. About 130 of them currently pay an aggregate of $140,000 a year for street maintenance, security and promotion. The district extends from the railroad tracks at Franklin Street, along Main Street, through the Dining & Entertainment District, south to Boughton Avenue.
"We feel that the downtown is coming back strong," said Robert V. Macklin, president of Ridgefield-based Village Bank, with branches in Wilton, New Milford and south Danbury. "It's already happening, and we want to be part of it." The bank is building a new 17,000-square-foot branch next to the Patriot Garage, scheduled to open next summer.
Union Savings Bank, a Danbury-based institution with 17 offices in western Connecticut, built The Galleria, a 40,000-square- foot brick office building that fills a former vacant lot on Main Street. Earlier, it had renovated a deteriorating building next door and leased it to Danbury Hospital
"The city has spent a lot of money to fix our streets and build the garage," said Charles Frosch, president of the bank. "This was a private effort to show we don't expect government to do everything."

HEADLINE: SCHOOLS;
It's Hot, Boring, Slow and Necessary. It's Summer School.

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: EDISON

 BODY:
First, the heat: it spreads through the halls like ether, dulling the senses and slowing down time. Eyes glaze over, heads droop low and the textbooks spread across sticky desks go unread.
In steamy classrooms around the state, summer school has begun. 
 It is a little-loved ritual, one that never seems to change. Unless they want to repeat a grade or take extra courses in the fall, students who fail a class must return to school in early July for five weeks of catch-up.
Since this is New Jersey and air conditioning in public schools is rare, they sit in classrooms as humid as rain forests, memorizing vocabulary words and math theorems while summer passes them by.
"It's hot; it's boring; it's slow," said Omar Leak, 17, who is repeating geometry and American history at J. P. Stevens High School here. "I want to be on the beach."
There is no rule requiring Mr. Leak and his peers to show up, since New Jersey students have the option of repeating classes during the regular school year. But most follow the advice of their guidance counselors, spending 60 hours in summer school to make up for a failing grade. (If they fail two classes, they must put in twice as much time.)
New Jersey does not have a standardized curriculum for summer school, so the offerings vary from district to district. Most summer programs fall into two categories: remedial, for students who have failed a class, and enrichment, for those who want to dabble in art, creative writing and other elective-type classes without earning credit. Many districts charge tuition for enrichment classes. In Edison, prices range from $35 for a 14-hour creative writing class to $90 for a 30-hour ceramics class.
The State Department of Education does not monitor summer programs or keep track of enrollments, so it is not clear how many students attend each year or exactly what they learn. One thing is certain, though: many districts have eliminated summer programs because of budget cuts. In districts with no summer school, struggling students must either do without or pay several hundred dollars to attend another district's program.
Edison, one of the state's largest districts, offers two summer school programs, remedial and enrichment, because it has so many students, said Donald Flor, who oversees the programs. About 650 are attending the high school remedial program this year, and about 10 percent come from neighboring towns, paying $300 a course. The money helps Edison sustain its program, which costs about $90,000 a year, Mr. Flor said.
"When you're talking about budget cuts, summer school is one of the first topics to come up," he said. "Every year we think we might lose the funding, but every year it comes through."
On Tuesday, the sixth day of Edison's remedial program, the mood at J. P. Stevens High was grim. In an algebra class, one student dozed while others scowled at their workbooks. Some prowled the halls; others sneaked outside to glimpse the sun. Algebra is the most common summer class, said John Russell, the head teacher, with geometry a close second.
In the cafeteria, more than 300 sweaty teen-agers hunched over tables while three teachers patrolled, making sure no one talked. This was Credit Completion Summer School, for students who passed their classes but had more than 13 absences. Tanya Foster, who said she had missed so many classes she lost count, was putting in time for the fifth summer in a row.
"If you do your work it's not bad, but if you want to fool around, it goes by slow," she said, grateful for the opportunity to talk without being shushed. "Yesterday it rained, and it was the slowest day ever."
About 20 Edison teachers are teaching summer school this year, and Mr. Russell said far more applied for the job. They are paid $42 an hour and teach up to five hours a day from July 1 to Aug. 2. The job is popular for economic reasons. But Mr. Russell said that even with the short hours, it is not necessarily easy.
"These teachers are earning their money," he said. "You get all the kids who didn't do well. They don't want to be here. You're doing a lot of fighting."
Like most other school districts, Edison does not offer a remedial program for elementary pupils because of financial limitations.
But increasingly, parents who can afford it are enrolling young children in for-profit summer schools. Huntington Learning Center, a national chain based in Oradell, has 13 centers in New Jersey. About 1,500 New Jersey children are enrolled this summer, said Al Prior, a spokesman.
At Huntington, parents pay $100 for diagnostic tests, then $35 an hour for classes that usually focus on math and reading skills, Mr. Prior said. Most children spend two to four hours a week at the centers, and most sign up for the entire summer, he said. Most are middle and high school students, but a growing number are ages 5 to 7, he added.
"Parents don't want their kid to go into that summer vegetation mode anymore," Mr. Prior said.
If Laura Gundry, an English teacher in charge of Edison's Credit Completion program, had her way, there would be no need for costly summer programs. In an ideal world, she said, New Jersey's public schools would all remain open in summer. (Two elementary schools in Trenton are already on a year-round schedule, as are more than 2,000 nationwide.) Since so many parents work and cannot afford to provide their children with educational opportunities in summer, she said, year-round school makes perfect sense.
"Let's get realistic: it's an idea whose time has come," Mrs. Gundry said. "Parents can't entertain their kids all summer anymore, and we shouldn't be closing schools for 10 weeks anymore."

HEADLINE: THE GREAT OUTDOORS;
Underfoot, a 750-Foot Test Mixing Ashes and Asphalt

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: ELIZABETH

 BODY:
To get to the giant Ikea store here, you may have to drive over your own garbage.
Despite the objection of environmentalists, 750 feet of Center Drive has been paved with a mixture of asphalt and ash from Warren County's incinerator, in an experiment designed to make incineration more financially viable. 
 "This may be a case where recycling this material rather than disposing of it may be worse for the environment," said Richard Denison, senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington. "Virtually no work has been done looking at long-term consequences. The heavy metals will be there in just as high a concentration in 50 years as today, so what's to stop that from showing up in the playground of a school in its next life?"
Only a decade ago, incinerators were hailed as an environmentally friendly way to dispose of solid waste, generating electricity while preserving dwindling landfill space. Seventeen percent of the nation's garbage is now burned, but burning it has not proved cost-efficient. Too many incinerators have been built, recycling has been more successful than expected, and the landfill shortage is not as severe as feared.
In New Jersey, where there are incinerators in Warren, Essex, Gloucester, Camden and Union Counties, it costs about $100 a ton to dispose of garbage in an incinerator, more than double the cost of using a landfill, said Bart Carhart, executive director of the Pollution Control Financing Authority of Warren County. And landfills still end up with leftover ash that may contain toxic lead, cadmium and chromium.
"These are the nuclear power plants of the 90's, both for the economic and environmental hazards," said Judith Enck, senior environmental associate with New York Public Interest Research Group in Albany.
To reduce costs, incinerator companies have helped sponsor projects to find uses for the ash. At the State University of New York in Stony Brook, Frank Roethel, a chemistry professor at the Waste Reduction and Management Institute, supervised the building of a boathouse in 1990 with 14,000 ash blocks. So far there have been no noticeable adverse environmental effects.
There have also been ash-paving projects in New Hampshire, Florida, Massachusetts, and now the one in Elizabeth, directed by a six-agency consortium headed by the state Department of Environmental Protection and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
"The amount of material being used is not enough to cause any kind of problem," said Warren Chesner, president of Chesner Engineering, in Commack, L.I., and coordinator for the Elizabeth project, where 15 percent of the asphalt mixture contains ash. "And you need to put it in a real-world traffic environment; if you put it out in the boonies, and you don't do it rigorously, you'll just have to do it after."
So far ash has not been an easy sell. Across the country, more than 280 municipalities have rejected ash-paving plans, according to Ellen Connett, who, with her husband, Dr. Paul Connett, publishes Waste Not, an anti-incineration newsletter in Canton, N.Y. The Elizabeth project was originally proposed for several Warren County locations, including a stretch of Interstate 80 -- but was rejected each time. When the Port Authority suggested putting the road on its own property on Center Drive, Union County and Elizabeth passed ordinances trying to prevent the use of ash on local roads, to no avail.
Supporters say that it is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of recycling ash.
"There are bad uses and good uses for ash, and asphalt is probably O.K.," said Marian Chertow, director of the Program on Solid Waste Policy at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. "Let's re-use the waste: this is the essence of industrial ecology, where one company's waste is another's feedstuff."
Opponents of the Elizabeth project have no plans to quit, no matter what conclusions officials draw about this project.
"They have a vested financial interest in seeing this stay afloat," said Madelyn Hoffman, director of the Grass Roots Environmental Organization in Flanders. "There's virtually no possibility that anything coming out of these tests will be other than a glowing recommendation."

HEADLINE: NEW JERSEY & CO.;
More Arduous Than Childbirth, It's the Time to Pick a Swimsuit

BYLINE: By DEBBIE GALANT 

DATELINE: WEST ORANGE

 BODY:
Linda Basch brings me a bathing suit that she says has been working for women who want to attract attention, well, upward. No wonder. The bottom of the suit is plain black, but the top third is a wacky, bold, black-and-white checkerboard on a weird slant, somehow reminiscent of the Op Art movement of the 1960's. Well, maybe it works for some women, but the leg on this suit is cut so high that it reveals parts of my body I've never noticed -- probably because of strong psychological defense mechanisms.
I draw open the curtains and the verdict is swift. Mrs. Basch wrinkles her nose and assumes a strained smile, as though she has just smelled something offensive. 
 Next suit.
We're in the rear dressing room of Helen Hirsh, a locally famous store that claims it has the biggest selection of swimsuits in the country, 5,000 in all, ranging from size 4 to size 54, and bulging to EE. And the only thing standing between me and a flattering fit is about $70. Because Mrs. Basch, the store's manager, and Betty Paskow, the store's owner, will bring me pile after pile of striped, tropical and classic black suits -- along with an equal measure of advice, criticism, reassurance and wisecracks -- until I am happy.
If Helen Hirsh were a big corporate conglomerate, it would surely hire the Gallup Organization to demonstrate statistically what every woman instinctively knows: that buying a bathing suit stands second only to giving birth as one of the most dreaded chores in the female curriculum. But because this is a small family business, it relies simply on a mug, used as a pencil holder, that a customer once brought in. "Things could be worse -- we could be trying on swimsuits," it says.
(The real Helen Hirsh, who sold the business in 1956, died at age 95 last year. She started in the lingerie business, a line that now keeps the store afloat outside of the summer and the winter cruisewear season.)
For most women, buying a bathing suit is truth time. Every potato chip and piece of chocolate you've ever eaten is now quite visible on your hips and, moreover, taunting you from the mirror. And unlike that power Armani suit, there's scant fabric in this suit to hide behind (or to hide your behind). "People are at their most insecure," Mrs. Basch says. "I would say that out of a thousand customers, one is happy with what she looks like."
That's where Mrs. Basch, Mrs. Paskow and 12 other fitters come in. Unlike most department stores, where you face the mirror and brutal fluorescent lights on your own, Helen Hirsh provides not one, but usually several doting, motherly types to size you up, run for more suits and eventually find the yard or so of Lycra that will best cover your flaws and flaunt your assets.
That may sound like mental cruelty, but the women who work here have at their disposal such a large inventory of bathing suits, and such extensive experience at fitting bodies of all shapes and sizes, that the process of trying on suits, opening the curtain and waiting for their pronouncements actually becomes (dare I suggest it?) fun.
Although most customers try on between 10 and 30 suits before they select one, Mrs. Basch recalls one client who literally stayed all day and tried more than 300 suits before settling on one she liked. "A department store will not give you any help," Mrs. Basch says. "It's a seasonal business for them and a primary business for us."
It helps that there's probably someone in the fitting room who's twice your size. Nor is your body -- or the fact that you might not even like it -- anything unusual at Helen Hirsh. In fact, the bathing suit ladies say, it's usually the size 6 women who are most uptight. "They always think they're fat," says Leah Mendelson, who has been fitting the hard-to-fit for 25 years. Mrs. Basch says she probably sees three certifiable anorexics a week.
Mrs. Paskow, the resident comedian, often breaks the tension of shopping for bathing suits by reminding her clientele that they're not making life-and-death decisions.
To the 60-somethings who worry about, say, too much cleavage, she points out: "They're not looking at you. They're looking at the 18-year-old with the long legs up to her neck and the 34 triple-D." Asked to sum up their own problems looking for bathing suits, Mrs. Basch reluctantly admits that she's larger on the bottom than than she is on top, while Mrs. Paskow openly confesses to the opposite problem. "Between the two of us, we make a perfect person, two perfect people," Mrs. Basch says. "God's variation on a theme," Mrs. Paskow says.
Of course, you must come to Helen Hirsh prepared for unflinching honesty. I thought the first suit was great. I thought I looked skinny. I thought I had done the impossible, found the perfect fit on the first try.
Wrong. Linda Basch shook her head, frowned and directed my attention from my legs and abdomen, which seemed astonishly svelte, to the two empty points that puckered out in front. "You don't fill it out," she said without a trace of embarrassment.
Eventually she did find me a suit I could fill out, and at its first appearance at the swimming pool, the compliments flowed. But I must have tried the same suit on four times before I finally bought it, fussing each time about one detail or another. The last time I fretted that perhaps it made my stomach look too big.
Mrs. Basch informed me that it was my panty line, not the suit, that was causing the problem. Then came the most humiliating experience I have ever endured in the service of journalism. In one brisk move, Mrs. Basch reached under my suit and tugged my underwear down to mid-thigh, thereby eradicating the panty line, my dignity and my last reservations about the suit. I was speechless.
But Mrs. Basch had a grin the size of Brooklyn. "The ultimate punishment!" she declared triumphantly.

HEADLINE: Market-Rate Rents In Manhattan: <arrow up>

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
THE Manhattan residential rental market is roil-ing, sometimes jetting spikes in prices to previ-ously unseen heights, and the impact is beginning to be felt in the other boroughs.
For those seeking shelter, not much is cheap in New York City's rental market these days, but the increases are most dramatic for unregulated units that make up about 600,000 of the city's 2 million apartments. 
 In terms of average rent rates and new construc tion -- standard measures of the industry -- the 26- county New York metropolitan region remains static, according to Federal data, barely showing signs of recovery from the deep real estate depression of the late 80's and early 90's.
But -- spurred by a healthy increase in jobs in the city last year, by continued robust activity on Wall Street, by the computer-driven growth of the so-called "new media" industry downtown and by bustling renewal projects like the redevelopment of Times Square and the 42d Street corridor -- Manhattan is a torrid rental market.
Whether that temperature can be sustained, and whether the steamy prices seeping into choice locations beyond Manhattan portend what one scholar called a "virtuous cycle" of renewal, or a time bomb for dislocation of tenants in the city's poorer neighborhoods, remains to be seen.
Still, "The big news is that the city is coming back," said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate and financing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. "And this is exciting because not all cities are coming back after the great East Coast real estate crash of the early 90's."
All the activity is churning a market still taut after an extended period during which there has been scant new construction of multiple-unit housing throughout the city. Permits for the building of only 5,991 apartments in all five boroughs were issued last year, according to the Department of City Planning. "And we really need to be creating about 40,000 units a year to keep the stock replenished," said Arthur Zabarkes, dean of the New York University Real Estate Institute.
And so, between increased economic activity, a gain of 28,200 jobs from May 1995 to May 1996, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, and a dearth of vacant apartments, the rental squeeze is on.
 Susan Foster has been pinched.
 Ms. Foster and her daughters, Ali, 13, and Erin, 12, were looking for "a big change," and certainly got one this month when they moved from a rural part of Pennsylvania, "with a population density of four people and four cows per square mile," to Manhattan.
A former undersecretary for intergovernmental affairs in the Carter administration, Ms. Foster, 48, had been living in a converted barn on a 155-acre dairy farm, 80 miles southwest of Harrisburg, when a job offer from her old boss, former Housing, Education and Welfare Secretary Joseph A. Califano Jr., enticed her to the big city.
"I was, of course, looking for a nice 6,000-, 7,000-square-foot home, just like the farm, for $2,000 a month," Ms. Foster said. "I called my friends in New York and, after they got done laughing, they told me I should think about downsizing." Eventually, Ms. Foster rented a three-bedroom apartment in a fashionable building on Riverside Drive -- for $3,650 a month.
Ms. Foster, who will be vice president of the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, said she had expected to run into "hard-sell, fast-talking, shark-like brokers from whom you had to protect your children."
Instead she found "some really decent human beings I was happy to do business with, except they charge an exorbitant brokerage fee" -- 15 percent of the first year's rent.
Gone, obviously, are the days of prospective tenants haggling for a lower rent, of offers for six months free occupancy, of the leasing agent saying, "I'll throw in a new refrigerator." Joyce West, vice president of the Charles H. Greenthal Residential Sales Corporation, said: "There was a time in the 70's and early 80's when things stayed on the market for years. Every building we managed had lots of vacancies."
Now, in Manhattan, the rental scene is one of bidding wars, C.I.A.-like security checks, four letters of reference and, in Ms. Foster's words, "a stamp on your forehead that says approved by the I.R.S."
THESE days, said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest Inc., one of Manhattan's largest rental companies, "we're seeing overall rent increases of 30 percent since the low point three years ago." In rarefied habitats, she said, some apartments rent for $15,000 a month, up to $3,000 more than only a year ago. Ms. West spoke of "large units bringing, sometimes, $20,000 to $25,000 a month -- that's $300,000 a year!"
The downtown market "is one of the hottest in the city," Ms. Packes said. "It, similarly, is getting all-time high prices, particularly lofts." A two-bedroom, 1,500-square-foot loft could rent for $4,500 to $5,000, she said. "We just did a rental at 240 Centre Street, the old police headquarters, a three-bedroom there for $6,000."
Kevin Singleton, vice president of the Rockrose Development Corporation, had one word for the market: "Frenzied."
Rockrose has not quite completed construction of a 148-unit building at 100 Jane Street in the West Village, and two-thirds of the building is already rented. "We started renting on June 7 and, as of today," Mr. Singleton said last week, "there are 50 apartments left."
"Because of construction," Mr. Singleton said, "we would show people an apartment on the fifth floor, tell them the same apartment is available three floors higher, and they would rent the apartment unseen. Can you imagine?"
Manhattan renters, it would seem, are growing accustomed to the once unimaginable. Despite high prices, said Ms. West of the Greenthal group, "The first six months of this year we more than doubled the amount of leases that have been signed."
Through the first six months of this year, according to a survey conducted by Feathered Nest of about 1,500 regulated and market-rate apartments -- many of them sublets in co-ops and condos -- rents for studios on the Upper East Side averaged $1,361, 3 percent more than the $1,317 only seven months ago. On the West Side, studios averaged $1,459, up 8.7 percent from $1,342 at the end of 1995. One-bedroom apartments on the East Side are currently averaging $2,067, up 4.9 percent from $1,970 last year; while on the West Side, one-bedrooms averaged $2,037, up 1 percent from $2,019 in December. The survey looked at a total of 343 one-bedroom apartments on both the East and West Sides.
For two-bedrooms on the East Side, rents are averaging $3,315, compared to $3,281, a 1 percent increase. The average two-bedroom on the West Side is up 6.8 percent, to $3,406 from $3,190.
And the three-bedroom market, according to the survey, which looked at a total of 48 apartments, is showing startling disparities. Three-bedroom apartments on the East Side are actually down 10.1 percent, to $4,687 from $5,214 at the end of last year. But three-bedrooms on the West Side are up a whopping 44 percent, to $5,910, compared to $4,100 in December.
Ms. Packes attributed the East-West divide to "a longterm trend since the 1980's toward the appreciation of the West Side."
Particularly on the East Side, she said, very affluent families are now finding it cheaper to buy apartments than continue renting. For moderately affluent people, the West Side, with its ornate, prewar housing stock, is now more desirable for renting, Ms. Packes said.
"For your young, single studio-dweller, the West Side is hotcakes," she said. "For families with children who don't have the capital to buy yet, it's two- and three-bedrooms on the West Side all the way."
The market "is definitely strong, and vacancy rates are very, very low," said Gary Jacobs, executive vice president of Glenwood Management, a company that builds, owns and manages thousands of units, mostly on Upper East Side.
Generally, Mr. Jacobs said, "we average 6 percent increases on a one-year lease, 8 percent for a two-year lease, but sometimes we get far more than a 30 percent increase -- when a formerly below-market stabilized apartment becomes available."
Dr. Wachter at the Wharton School has devised her own method for assessing the strength of the market. Using the bi-monthly TRW-Redi Inc. Realty Report, which is based on public deed filings, Dr. Wachter looked at the prices of rental buildings that sold in April or May of this year and compared them to prices paid for the same buildings when they were previously sold in 1993 or since. Dr. Wachter found:
-- A four-story building on East 13th Street, sold in April for $3.15 million, had previously sold in February 1994 for $2.9 million.
-- A four-story building on West 83d Street sold in May for $1.85 million, triple the previous price of $620,000 in May 1993.
-- A five-story building on East 66th Street sold in April for $4.11 million, nearly four times its previous price of $1.25 million in August 1993.
The surge in building prices may be prompted, Dr. Wachter said, by the possibility that the New York State Legislature will modify or even not renew rent regulation in June of next year. But more immediately, she said, the deals indicate "that the rental market is recovering from its 1993 doldrums, that people are willing to buy at prices we haven't seen since before 1993."
And, obviously, they are willing to buy because there are people willing to rent. "Niches in Manhattan are soaring, driven by affluent baby boomers," said James W. Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "At this stage, nationally and certainly in New York City, family-raising baby boomers are the center of the housing market pork chop."
BUT a prime cut of the market, particularly in these not-so-lazy days of summer, is the throng of diploma-clutching college graduates joining trainee programs throughout the city's financial community.
Fresh-faced Jessica Uccellini, a slim, sparkly energy force ready to burst upon the city, fits the profile.
Ms. Uccellini, 22, just graduated from Georgetown University and, in September, will join a training program at Chase Manhattan Bank. With counsel from her father, a real estate broker in their hometown, Troy, N.Y., Ms. Uccellini started looking for an apartment in May. "New York has proven to be unlike any other real estate market, according to my Dad," she said. "He said it's very undisciplined, anything goes."
One broker, recommended by friends of the family, "showed us beautiful apartments," Ms. Uccellini said, "but they were way above my price range" -- $1,800 to $2,500 a month, with assistance from her family. "She was showing me apartments for $2,700, $3,200, even a one-bedroom for $3,700." The apartments in Ms. Uccellini's price range were "horrid," she said.
Eventually, she placed a bid. "The reason New York has proven such an enigma is that, No. 1, they negotiate rents, which is not something I had ever heard of before; and my dad was surprised about that," Ms. Uccellini said. "Second, we had my credit checks done, sent them deposit checks, and it turns out they got a better offer, $50 more a month.
"It's very strange to think you're going to be living somewhere and then, three days later, 'No, sorry, we had a better offer.' "
Another "really strange" thing about the Manhattan market, Ms. Uccellini said, is that there is no multiple listing service, "so a broker's knowledge of available rental places is only as extensive as her network of friends or other brokers."
After family consultations, the Uccellinis decided to try other brokers, one of whom, Karen Rathje of the Corcoran Group, lined up nine apartments, all within 15 minutes' walk on the West Side. The fourth one on the list -- in the Apthorp on Broadway between 78th and 79th Streets, a block-square Renaissance Revival building with a fountain in its grand courtyard -- reminded Ms. Uccellini of "a chateau in France." And a one-bedroom was available for $2,100 a month.
"I was in awe," Ms. Uccellini said. "My mother said, 'We just won the lottery.' "
With $2,100 a month for a one-bedroom evoking lottery-prize elation, prospects for the Manhattan market are difficult to gauge. Cathe LeBlanc, director of the rental division at the Corcoran Group, believes rents may have peaked. "Prices are not going to drop overnight," she said, "but I'd say in six months to a year you're going to find a lot more negotiating going on."
Ms. LeBlanc views apartment rentals and sales as bedfellows on an old mattress. With rents so high, many tenants now see buying as the better option, and with sales prices rising, potential buyers might be afraid of being left behind.
"It could go one or two ways," Ms. LeBlanc said. "A lot of the apartments currently being rented in co-ops and condos may go on the market for sale, instead of rental again, which will keep the rental market fairly tight. Or, owners may keep renting because the return is so high. If that's the case, I think you'll see a lot more apartments to choose from and negotiating on rental prices."
The current price pressure in Manhattan is rippling through other sections of the city.
In Brooklyn Heights, for example, said Brian Lehner, a rental agent for the William B. May Company, one-bedroom apartments currently rent for between $1,200 and $1,800, two-bedrooms for $1,400 to $3,000, and three-bedrooms for $2,200 to $3,500 "and more."
Even in less tony Fort Greene, Brooklyn, said Katherine Lilly, owner of Realty on the Greene, "good one-bedrooms are going for at least $1,000," two-bedrooms for between $1,000 and $1,800, and three-bedrooms from $1,500 to "well over $2,000."
"I would say," Ms. Lilly added, "that rents are 15 percent higher than three years ago, and they are renting much quicker to better qualified people -- a lot of music and movie industry people, a lot of people from out of state."
Susan Goldy, president of the Bronx Board of Realtors, said that as Manhattan goes, so goes Riverdale, "with a lag time of three to six months and a differential of 20 percent; and there's probably a 20 percent differential between Riverdale and the rest of the Bronx." In Riverdale, Ms. Goldy said, one-bedrooms are renting for between $750 and $1,100, two-bedrooms for $1,000 to $1,600, and three-bedrooms for $1,400 to $1,800.
Earl Washington's clientele at United Realty Services on the Grand Concourse includes many working-class people and welfare recipients. With signs of renewal in the Bronx -- "We've gone through the burn-outs, the vandalism, the landlords abandoning buildings," Mr. Washington said -- rents have racheted up in recent years. Rents brokered by his agency range from $475 to $850 for a one-bedroom to between $875 and $1,200 for a three-bedroom apartment. "For deregulated apartments, you're probably looking at 10 to 15 percent increases over the last three years," Mr. Washington said.
In Queens, according to Joseph Mottola, head of the Long Island Board of Realtors (which includes the borough as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties), one-bedrooms are going for $600 to $800, two-bedrooms from $650 to $900, and three-bedrooms from $900 to $1,400. And those prices hold even for so-called working-class neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, East Elmhurst and Corona, said Edward Butts, owner of Butts Realty. A three-bedroom apartment in those communities, Mr. Butts said, "goes anywhere from $900 to $1,200."
And on Staten Island -- where Thomas Maira, owner of Maira Real Estate, said, "If there are 20 apartment buildings here, I'm just unconscious of them" -- a two-bedroom in a building close to the Verrazano Bridge is currently listed for $1,200.
The city's rental stock comprises both regulated and unregulated apartments. The approximately 600,000 unregulated apartments include those in buildings built after 1973, certain co-ops being rented by their owners (in many cases sponsors who attempted to convert buildings into co-ops or the institutions or other owners who bought them out), apartments that have been released from the restraints of rent regulation, frequently because their rent rose beyond $2,000 a month, and apartments in buildings with five or fewer units.
Apartments under rent stabilization (rent control, the other type of regulation, applies to only about 101,000 units), are currently subject to an 8.5 percent increase when a lease is signed after a vacancy, and to decontrol if they are vacant and have attained a $2,000 a month rental. In addition, apartments can be deregulated if they rent for $2,000 and their occupants have had a combined income of $250,000 for two years in a row.
CONTINUED price pressure on the boroughs beyond Manhattan could have an impact on poorer sections of the city where rent-regulated and subsidized apartments are particularly hard to obtain. What that impact will be is a subject of debate.
"I think it can be the best thing that happens to the other borough neighborhoods," Dean Zabarkes at N.Y.U said. "The person who comes to New York and can't find a Manhattan apartment is now going to look elsewhere. The beneficiaries will be New Jersey, Queens, parts of Brooklyn and good old Riverdale. The Concourse will see it."
In 1993, however, the city's Housing and Vacancy Survey indicated that less than 2 percent of all apartments with rents below $500 were vacant. And last month, the city's Rent Guidelines Board approved the largest rent increases in seven years -- 5 percent for a one-year lease and 7 percent for a two-year lease -- for tenants of the city's 1 million stabilized apartments, who currently pay an average $660 a month.
At the same time, Federal rent subsidies for low-income tenants in about 100,000 apartments begin coming up for renewal -- or expiration -- starting this year. If subsidies expire, some of those apartments in middle-income neighborhoods could go to free-market rates while others, in poorer communities where tenants cannot afford to pay more, could be abandoned as landlords see their rent streams narrowed.
"The city could lose from 30,000 to 50,000 low-income units over the next five years," said Victor Bach, director of housing policy and research at the Community Service Society, a nonprofit anti-poverty agency. "Given the limited supply of decent housing available on the open market, we're likely to see a lot more doubling up among low-income families and, perhaps, unprecedented levels of family homelessness."
Dr. Wachter at the Wharton School sees the ripple effect of increasing rents as prompting "a virtuous cycle -- rather than a vicious cycle -- of redevelopment and renovation, leading to additional supply, which helps cap the rental pressure."
"But it's not all good," she concedes. "It squeezes people."

HEADLINE: CHICAGO BUILDINGS;
Still Magnificent, And Thriving Too

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As Alderman of the 42d Ward, where the Magnificent Mile is situated, I am vexed by Paul Goldberger's allegations that we are ravaging our heritage and destroying the architectural environment here in Chicago ["In Chicago, a Tale of Lost Magnificence," June 16]. The tone of his article is highly inflammatory, endeavoring to stir up controversy where none should exist. This is insulting to all of us who have worked hard to insure the economic prosperity and esthetic beauty of Chicago's central boulevard. 
 We are disappointed that Mr. Goldberger is "profoundly depressed" because Chicago's North Michigan Avenue has not preserved every single one of its medium-size commercial buildings but rather has made way for large modern buildings. He overlooks the fact that we have preserved many of these older buildings and maintained the mid-rise scale of the avenue.
In the 25 years I have served on the Chicago City Council, I have seen North Michigan Avenue blossom into an economic giant and a prosperous mercantile center rivaling Fifth Avenue. I find it quaint that a New Yorker would recommend that we keep this city in antiquarian limbo while the glass towers and commerce of his city reap money.
Mr. Goldberger is depressed. Well, I am elated by the new North Michigan Avenue. It is beautiful and prosperous, and the tourist dollars continue to roll in.

HEADLINE: THEATER TICKETS;
Struggling Students Can't Afford Them

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I find Bruce M. Robinson's tolerance, if not defense, of today's high-priced theater tickets [Letters to the Editor, June 16] insensitive to all of us who struggle with the economics of value. 
 Like Mr. Robinson, I, too, am a clergyman, and although not yet retired, I'm at an age where balcony seats are out of the question.
While a student at Pratt Institute in the early 50's, I happily skipped one meal a week in order to see everything on stage -- theater, ballet and musical performances. A seat in the last rows of the balcony cost between $1.20 and $1.80. Today, a student's meal costs far less than a $35 balcony seat.
Because I need to sit close to the stage, a single theater ticket, a train ticket from Connecticut and a cheap meal tops $100. As difficult as this is for me, imagine how much more it must be for the underprivileged student.

HEADLINE: ATLANTA: A VIEWER'S GUIDE;
When a Change of Address Comes With a New Anthem

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY 

 BODY:
AT THE 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Alina Astafei won a silver medal in the high jump for Romania. She is favored to win another medal in Atlanta, but if she does, she will win it for Germany.
Mark McKoy won the gold in the 110-meter hurdles for Canada in 1992. But in Atlanta, the name on his warm-up suit will be Austria. 
 Astafei and McKoy are hardly anomalies this Olympic year. In an era of E-mail, mass tourism and mass immigration, athletes are also on the move. A Bulgarian weight lifter is now cleaning and jerking for Australia; a British long jumper is now leaping for Italy; a Russian is hurdling for Sweden, and Chinese table tennis players are competing for at least 15 different countries, including the United States.
"It boggles the mind," said Ian Marshall, administrative director of the International Table Tennis Federation.
The dissolution of the Soviet Union and its bloc is the biggest reason for the unprecedented and sometimes controversial movement. No fewer than 22 of the athletes who will represent Germany in Atlanta were not Germans in 1992 and most of them came from Eastern Europe. Of the 25 athletes who will represent Israel, 10 immigrated from Eastern Europe in the 1990's. To underline how much the geographical and psychological borders have been redrawn, the American weight-lifting team has a former Soviet named Konstantine Starikovich who amuses others and presumably himself by doing Beavis and Butt-head imitations.
Global village indeed.
Some athletes move for love: Li Dong Hua, a Chinese men's gymnast, married a Swiss tourist he met in Beijing and is now a contender on pommel horse for Switzerland. Some move for money: McKoy's agent, Robert Wagner, is an Austrian who believed there were more business opportunities for him in Austria.
And it is not just the athletes who leave. Since the collapse of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many of the brightest coaching minds in the former Soviet bloc have left for more stable and remunerative environs. Romanian coaches have helped Greek and French gymnasts make significant leaps. A Russian coach is behind the development of the Syrian heptathlete Ghada Shouaa. East German coaches are developing fine rowers all over the globe.
Cases of Olympians changing nationality are hardly new. Olga Fikotova, the 1956 women's discus champion from Czechoslovakia, became a four-time United States Olympian after marrying the American hammer thrower Harold Connolly. Zola Budd, a distance runner from then-banned South Africa, took British citizenship so she could compete (and collide with Mary Decker) in the 1984 Olympics. Two years later, a gifted 19-year-old Bulgarian weight lifter of Turkish descent named Naim Shalamanov defected to Turkey. He changed his name to Naim Suleymanoglu and lived up to his nickname, Pocket Hercules, by winning Olympic golds in 1988 and 1992.
The Olympic charter states that an athlete who has competed internationally for one country (even as a junior) and then changes citizenship or allegiance must wait three years before competing for the new nation. However, if the athlete's former national Olympic committee and the relevant international sports federation grant permission, the International Olympic Committee can waive the three-year requirement. (Some sports, like soccer, do not permit players to change national teams.)
Gilbert Felli, the I.O.C. sports director, said there were 47 such eligibility cases before the 1992 Olympics. Although precise statistics for 1996 remain unavailable, Felli said there were almost 90 heading into Atlanta. Those figures do not take into account athletes who waited the three years or emigrated before competing internationally.
Germany, with its relatively liberal immigration laws and economic might, has become a destination of choice. "Some of our sportsmen and sportswomen are not so happy about it because some of them have had their places taken away," said Manfred Seeger of the German Olympic Committee. "On the other hand, we have to look out for these people who come to us. But we have to find a better middle road."
The most intriguing of the new Germans is Astafei, who was known as Galina, not Alina, when she competed in the high jump for Romania. Astafei's brother was shot and killed during a demonstration in 1989, the year the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled from power. According to Astafei, her brother's unsolved murder is one of the main reasons she left Romania for a sports club in Mainz, Germany, in 1993 with her husband and 3-year-old daughter. At the time, Astafei also said she wanted "to enable my daughter to have a future."
Romanian sports officials reacted angrily to her departure, and even after she received German citizenship in February 1995 and won the world indoor title for Germany, they refused to waive the three-year waiting period.
"It's not fair the rich could steal the poor's work," the sports minister Alexandru Mironov said then. Mironov was insisting publicly that Germany pay the Romanian Olympic Committee to compensate for Astafei's loss. He estimated Romania had spent nearly $700,000 training her.
But in April, the Romanian committee voted, 4-3, to let Astafei compete for Germany. Even though the committee recently had closed a $1 million sponsorship deal with a German sporting goods company, Lia Manoliu, president of the Romanian organization, said there was no link between the deal and the vote. "To say no to Galina would have been the most serious punishment you could give to an athlete," Manoliu said.
Cash settlements are not unprecedented. When Suleymanoglu defected, the Turkish government paid $1 million to the Bulgarians so they would waive the three-year rule. When the weight lifter Kakhi Kakhiachvili, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist from Georgia, decided to compete for Greece in 1994, the French daily L'Equipe reported that the Georgians were paid the equivalent of $100,000 to give their assent.
Dionissis Gangas, general secretary of the Greek Olympic Committee, said he knows of no such payment. What is indisputable is that Kakhiachvili, now known by the more Grecian name Kakiasvilis, received his Greek passport in only nine days. According to Gangas, what greased the bureaucratic machine was not his talent but his mother's Greek origins.
"Accepting those with Greek blood is logical and normal, but I am against the nationalization of ready-made champions with no connections to a country," Gangas said. But he admitted that the Greeks have not always respected this distinction and cited one example: the wide-scale adoption of teen-age basketball players from the former Yugoslavia. "It's totally legal," he said. "I'm a lawyer so I know, but it is crazy, stupid."
In the United States, a country whose very existence is based on immigration, recent efforts to accelerate citizenship requests for athletes have met with little success. The handful of naturalized Americans who will be in Atlanta, including Monica Seles and Hakeem Olajuwon, had to wait the requisite five years for citizenship.
Seles and Olajuwon both have expressed pride about representing the United States. Kevin Han, a badminton player who left Shanghai for New York at age 17, says he dreamed of competing for the United States as a child. But it is clear that childhood dreams and adult patriotism do not always dictate the movements of the modern Olympic athlete.
"I think first of all, the athletes are in the Olympics for themselves, not their coaches, not their families but themselves," said Astafei's agent, Gunter Eisinger, a former German track and field coach. "Only if they are in a medal ceremony and see that flag and see that hymn do they get the feeling of the team or the nation. But this is not the first point, not anymore."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
On the Fast-Food Menu, Another Taste of Value Pricing

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
IT was hard to miss all those Taco Bell price-cutting ads last month. Many consumers immediately began uttering five of the most important words in the English language: What's in it for me?
To be sure, saving a few fast-food dollars will hardly send one's children to college, but with food prices expected to jump at grocery stores because of higher grain prices, cheaper fast food provides at least some relief. And the cost of eating out is hardly a theoretical issue for that classic American statistical unit, the family of four: it averages $1,500 a year on fast food, according to the NPD Group, a market-research consultant in Rosemont, Ill. 
 Taco Bell, which has lagged behind Pizza Hut and KFC in same-store sales among Pepsico's three fast-food chains, moved to cut that bill a bit last month when it announced its new Extreme Value Combos, priced at $1.99. These combination meals, which include a soft drink plus three tacos or two burritos, cost about 25 percent less than if the items are purchased separately. They are also $1 less than the burger-fries-soda combination meals at many of Taco Bell's hamburger-chain competitors.
"A heavy fast-food user eats in a fast-food restaurant about 10 times a week," said John N. Martin, the chairman and chief executive of Taco Bell. "Now, if our customers can save a buck every time they eat, that's enough to go to the movies or fill the tank with gas."
It isn't the first time that Taco Bell has outpriced the competition. In 1988, Taco Bell "was the first to go aggressively for value pricing, and it influenced McDonald's, Burger King and Domino's, as well as Pizza Hut and KFC," said Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a restaurant-industry consultant in Chicago.
In the 1980's, the concept of value pricing was new, but these days, it is less likely that Taco Bell's competitors will follow suit. "Taco Bell is returning to its heritage, but other chains have already gotten the value message," said Andrew J. Conway, a beverage analyst for Morgan Stanley & Company.
McDonald's declined comment on Taco Bell's announcement, and Burger King said it would not copy Taco Bell. "We will not come down in price in response to Taco Bell," said Cori Zywotow, a company spokeswoman.
Although there may not be a fast-food price war this summer, analysts expect the price-cutting by Taco Bell to have a moderating effect. "McDonald's is now under pressure to watch the pricing on Arch Deluxe," the hamburger it introduced recently, Mr. Paul said. "Simply put, Taco Bell is under the $2 price point, and McDonald's is over it."
McDonald's may have another problem. Despite the hoopla over the recent introduction of the Arch Deluxe, sales, though strong, have been below expectations, according to industry executives. Arch Deluxe sells for $2.09 to $2.49, depending on the ingredients.
The problem for Taco Bell, which had $4.5 billion in revenue last year, is that it is still competing not only against McDonald's and Burger King but also against low beef prices. "Red meat continues to be so cheap that McDonald's and Burger King are ruling the fast-food roost," said Terry Bivens, a food analyst for Donald & Company.
In addition, Taco Bell has languished after its reduced-fat Border Lights Mexican-food menu failed to increase the customer base in 1995. "When the company introduced Border Lights, it lost some of its focus, and lost some of its core heavy consumers to McDonald's and Burger King," Mr. Conway said. "It created customer confusion."
To Mr. Martin of Taco Bell, Border Lights, which the company still offers, was "a success because we sold $650 million worth of it," he said. "The execution was the problem," he added. "The complexity of the offerings slowed our service from 4 to 6 minutes." He referred to the average wait from the time customers entered a Taco Bell until they were served.
"Taco Bell is having trouble with new-product introductions, so price is now their most powerful marketing tool," said Roy D. Burry, a securities analyst for Oppenheimer & Company.
But the new combinations are more than a marketing tool. Despite the low prices, the items are not envisioned as loss leaders.
"It's tough to make a margin on $1.99, but we can do it if we have an increase in our traffic," Mr. Martin said. "Then you get the economies of scale. Of course if you don't get more customers, you're going to take a margin hit."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Around the World, Cheers for Small Stocks

BYLINE: By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN 

 BODY:
OVER the last six months, small-company international stock funds have come into their own. While the average foreign stock fund has risen 9.2 percent in the first half of the year, the small-company stock funds that invest primarily abroad have returned 14 percent. Over the last 12 months, they have also outperformed an index of larger-company stocks, the Morgan Stanley Europe Asia Far East index, 19 percent to 13.3 percent.
Despite these gains, small-company international funds remain a relative backwater in a rushing tide of cash toward stock mutual funds. Of the 37 small-company international stock funds followed by Morningstar Inc., just three have more than $1 billion under management -- Templeton Global Smaller Companies, Acorn International and Capital Research and Management's Smallcap World Fund. 
 That few investors have found their way into this sector is not surprising. As a result of recessions, tight monetary policies and emerging-market blowups, small-company international investing left much to be desired in the first half of the 90's. From January 1990 to December 1995, small-capitalization, or small-cap, foreign stocks underperformed large foreign stocks by more than 15 percent on a cumulative price basis, according to Acadian Asset Management, a small-cap international money manager in Boston.
Yet in the last three years, mutual fund companies in the United States have rolled out almost two dozen small-company international stock funds. And within the last 12 months, these funds have taken off.
To be sure, a fair number have benefited from the big gains in small-company domestic stocks. Six of the top 10 small-company international funds are "world," or "global," funds that invest in both American and foreign stocks. At one time or another over the last year, these world funds have had just 40 percent of their portfolios invested abroad.
AMONG the funds is Fontaine Global Growth, which has led the group over the last year with a total return of 52.7 percent. Heavily invested in North American mining stocks, it has had as little as 37 percent of its portfolio in foreign investments in that period. But the list of top performers also includes some exclusively foreign small-company funds, like Invesco European Small Company, Twentieth Century International Emerging Growth, Founders Passport and Montgomery International Small Cap.
The main impetus behind this performance has been the improving world economy. Small-company stocks typically perform better in stronger economic environments, said Nitin Mehta, senior portfolio manager in London for Seligman Henderson, a money management firm. When economies are slowing, investors often seek larger, more stable companies. Because Europe and Japan have been showing signs of new economic life and all major world economies are expected to grow next year, Mr. Mehta said, investors have been putting money to work in smaller companies.
An equally important factor has been demand from United States money managers. Looking for diversification, they have found a wealth of good, fast-growing small companies abroad that are still relatively unknown and undervalued. Managers cite Fresenius of Germany, a supplier of kidney dialysis equipment; Laox, a Japanese electronics retailer, and JBA Holdings, a British software company.
Indeed, these small-company funds tend to invest in different market sectors than typical United States small-cap funds do. Instead of relying heavily on technology and health services, the foreign portfolios generally have greater concentrations in cyclical industrial stocks, consumer durable goods and even financial stocks. Henrik Strabo, lead manager for the Twentieth Century International Emerging Growth fund, likes a German bank, Marchollek Lautenschlager, which he described as "very service-driven."
The small-cap arena "is where the real growth is coming from," said Michael Gerding, manager of the Founders Passport fund, which has investments in Salomon, a French manufacturer of ski and golf equipment, and Grolsch N.V., the midsized Dutch brewery group. On average, company earnings in the small-cap international fund group tracked by Morningstar are growing 17 percent a year, compared with 9 percent for all foreign stock funds.
Even more excitement has been created by what Mr. Strabo described as "a whole transformation going on in how the capital markets work" in Europe. Companies formed after World War II as family enterprises and financed primarily by banks have been finding that they can finance their growth at less cost and attract new managerial talent by raising capital in the equity markets, he and other managers said. Governments in Europe and Japan have also encouraged small companies to raise money in public markets, according to money managers.
"People like me are jumping up and down with joy," said Allan Raphael, co-portfolio manager of the First Eagle International fund, which invests in both small- and mid-cap foreign stocks. Investors used to find small, fast-growing public companies primarily in the United States and Britain, he said. "Now," he added, "people have the ability to invest in these types of companies elsewhere." Among Mr. Raphael's favorites is Pagnossin, the Italian ceramic company whose brightly colored dishes are sold at Bloomingdale's and other department stores.
Because European institutions have typically shied away from investing in small-company stocks and because of their poor performance in the last six years, their valuations remain very attractive, managers said. "The stocks are very cheap against a much more benign background," said Ronald Frashure, senior portfolio manager at Acadian.
UNTIL recently, the lack of interest in this type of foreign investment also meant that the markets were less efficient. Managers at the AIM Global Aggressive Growth fund have found that when fewer analysts and investors follow a small foreign company, the consensus earnings estimates tend to be further off the mark.
"That presents an opportunity for better returns," said Paul Rogge, co-portfolio manager of the fund.
And for bigger losses. Foreign small-cap stocks, like their American counterparts, can rise and fall faster than larger stocks because fewer shares are available to trade. Like other international funds, the small-company variety also exposes investors to currency risk, but with an interesting twist, Mr. Gerding said. Large companies with global businesses tend to have a natural hedge against weakness in their own currency. If the Swedish krona weakens against the dollar, for example, Volvo will earn more dollars from its American sales. That dynamic will not be at work for a company that sells primarily in a home market.
Investors in the T. Rowe Price International Discovery fund have seen the pitfalls of investing in this sector. In 1990, when most of the world's major economies slipped into recession, the fund fell almost 13 percent, about 10 percentage points worse than the Standard & Poor's 500. In 1994, the fund's investments in small companies in emerging markets helped drive down returns by more than 7.5 percent while the Morgan Stanley index rose 7.8 percent.
David Warren, an executive vice president at Rowe Price-Fleming International, which manages the fund, said that the first two years of the fund -- 1988 and 1989 -- were great but that the 1990's were tough. "You've got to be long-term oriented" in this market, he said.
RESEARCH by Wanger Asset Management, which offers the Acorn International fund, indicates that since 1985, small-company foreign stocks have provided returns about two percentage points a year higher than large-company foreign stocks. "You should get paid more for less liquidity and the younger nature of these companies," said Leah Zell, co-manager of Acorn International.
Ms. Zell likes the stock of Kempen, which manages two of the oldest small-company mutual funds in the Netherlands, and of the Philippines-based International Container Terminal Services, which manages and operates ports in emerging countries where trade is growing rapidly.
Given the outlook for world economies and the liberalization of capital markets, managers say that now is a good time to get into small-company international funds. "We're still finding good opportunities and, given the environment, we're very optimistic," Mr. Gerding said.
Nor do the managers seem unnerved by any weakness in the United States market. "We feel that because the interest rate and economic fundamentals are different and because of the different makeup of the company sectors," said Mr. Frashure at Acadian, "any selloff among United States small stocks will not be contagious to the international small-cap market."
One sign of the opportunities is new investment by savvy stock pickers like Michael Price, said Craig Litman, partner at Litman Gregory & Company, an investment advisory firm in San Francisco. On July 3, Mr. Price's Heine Securities began offering the Mutual European fund, which invests primarily in European small-company stocks and has raised $50 million so far.

HEADLINE: Bond Market Listens to Savers, Not Bears

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I am glad I'm not one of James K. Galbraith's economics students on the receiving end of the disinformation in "What Inflation?" (Op-Ed, July 10), wherein he blames bear-market speculators with dubious motives for the sharp decline in bond prices this year. Students take note: 
 * The United States bond market is an arena importantly affected by foreign investors and not as inefficient as Mr. Galbraith implies.
* Markets reflect not only current conditions but also anticipated ones. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin has proposed issuing inflation-indexed Government bonds to help investors overcome inflation fears. Such a device should not be necessary for a fiscally sound economic power.
* There is a "new math" at work in the United States where a 3 percent inflation rate is acceptable. Elsewhere, in Germany, for example, the old math still applies: zero inflation is the acceptable rate. Bond investors know this and insist on adequate real returns to compensate for inflation risks. Monetary policy, therefore, is watched closely as a critical line of defense against any fiscal actions that are an attack on the nation's wealth -- the savings of millions of its citizenry.
It is the voice of savers that is expressed in bond market movements, not "speculators," which Professor Galbraith chooses not to hear.

HEADLINE: For Bank's Boy Wonder, Gray Hairs and Lessons

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL 

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia

 BODY:
'I'VE made every mistake that anybody in the business has made," John S. Reed says, twirling his half-glasses in his hotel-room armchair.
He has too much gray in his black hair to be banking's boy wonder anymore. He is still an eclectic thinker, with more interest in the future than in the stodgy ways of banking. But Mr. Reed now blends his enthusiasm with a new sobriety forged in 12 painful years as chairman and chief executive of Citicorp. 
 For a chief executive, he is studiously unconcerned about his image. He assigns Citicorp's vice chairman, Paul Collins, to read articles written about the company so that he doesn't have to. He rarely has his picture taken, even for the company's annual report. And he hadn't granted an interview to a major publication since 1992.
He did agree to comment for this article on his new corporate strategy that places more emphasis on emerging markets. But he insisted that he would speak only for 15 minutes, and that the interview be in Australia, where he was attending a banking conference.
When he arrived in the hotel room in Sydney, Mr. Reed was, as always, far more candid than these cagey conditions would have predicted. He spoke for more than an hour, in two sessions, about a range of issues. Here are some of the lessons he has learned, based on his comments and those of people who have spoken with him:

BE A HANDS-ON MANAGER "When I came into my job, I assumed that we had a whole set of very capable people who knew lots of stuff that I didn't know, and that I just had to make sure to give them permission to run and to balance the company," Mr. Reed said. "I no longer believe that. I'm today running the company and you see my own judgments involved in some of these things in a way that wasn't true before."
 
DON'T RUN A HORSE RACE FOR A SUCCESSOR Mr. Reed was chosen in a public three-way contest, and the infighting that resulted consumed much of the bank. Now he says that as soon as he knows whom he wants as his successor, he will appoint him or her president. (One leading candidate, Roberta Arena, who is in charge of credit cards, is a woman, and three were born outside the United States.)
To make room for possible successors, Mr. Reed pushed aside Pei-yuan Chia, the vice chairman most responsible for the bank's international consumer business, asking him to take early retirement after he refused to delegate more responsibility to younger executives. Mr. Reed has called Mr. Chia, who is 57, a "corporal in general's clothing," say people who have spoken to the chairman on the subject.
 
WATCH OUT FOR REAL ESTATE "Real estate's a great business in southeastern Asia, where you have rapid growth and reasonably high inflation. Real estate in Germany, where you have no growth and no inflation, is just absolute suicide. And why bankers haven't figured that one out a long time ago I don't know, but demonstrably they haven't."
 
AVOID ACQUISITIONS "We've tried the idea of an acquisition, and frankly our view is it's not a great way to go," Mr. Reed said. "I looked on a pro-forma basis at what a merger between us and Nationsbank might look like. If it had produced some startlingly interesting result I would have said, 'Gee, maybe we should look at that,' but I didn't."
The biggest problem with such a blockbuster merger? "It would be hard to sell the stock," Mr. Reed said. "Our international strength would be diluted so much by the size of our U.S. activities it would be hard to give an independent value to the international side of the business."
 
RESIGN YOURSELF TO THE MARKET'S WHIMS William H. Gates founded the Microsoft Corporation in 1975, a year before Mr. Reed began Citicorp's aggressive push into consumer banking.
"It's funny," Mr. Reed said, Citibank's consumer business "started from zero and makes more money than Microsoft. If we could write a browser, we'd be selling at 40 times earnings."
 
CONSIDER WHETHER TO STAY OR GO By the end of the summer, Mr. Reed said, he will decide whether to move Citicorp's corporate headquarters out of New York City. "There are two drawbacks to New York," he said. "We're so established there and so forth that we could sleep without knowing it. And some of our principal operating businesses are there."
Mr. Reed worries that having the boss around will be too much of a distraction for the people who run the big New York branch system and other local activities.
Some executives say the best place is London, because its time zone makes it easier to have daylight conversations with Europe, Asia and the Americas. But "I think I'd have a legal problem running the company outside of the U.S.," Mr. Reed said.
Would he like to move the company to Princeton, N.J., where Mr. Reed has moved with his second wife, Cindy? "No, no, no, no," he said. "When I go down Nassau Street, I would not want to run into a bunch of Citibankers."

Holy War Is Home To Haunt the Saudis

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
EVEN as he confessed to a terrorist bombing that left five Americans dead last year, the young Saudi still spoke with obvious pride about how religious fervor had led him to join a jihad, or holy war, in a distant Muslim land.
"I did travel to Afghanistan," the 28-year-old, Muslih al-Shamrani, recalled in a televised confession. "I was trained in the use of light and heavy weapons. In Afghanistan, I met people of various nationalities who charged rulers and scholars with blasphemy." He brought his extremism home, joining with three friends to target the Saudi Government and its American backers. "We decided to carry out an act of jihad inside Saudi Arabia," he said. 
 Their target last November was an American-run military training center in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. And as they acknowledged in confessing to the deadly bombing, Mr. Shamrani and two of the other terrorists were veterans of the jihad in Afghanistan. There, they said, they were schooled in Muslim fundamentalism -- and in the means of translating their anti-Saudi, anti-American extremism into violence.
Their holy war did not end when they were beheaded in a public square in Riyadh on May 31 (an execution that, American officials say, cut short an inquiry into who else might have been involved). In fact, the executions almost certainly made martyrs of them in the eyes of some of the thousands of young Saudis who, encouraged by their Government, had also made the pilgrimage to Afghanistan, the scene of what American and Saudi policy makers once described as a great victory of the cold war.
When another bomb blast killed 19 American airmen in an apartment complex in eastern Saudi Arabia last month, suspicions turned immediately to the veterans of Afghanistan. Had they struck again? And could America and Saudi Arabia have unwittingly set in motion the training of fundamentalist zealots who are now turning their skills against their former patrons?
 
 
 
'Our Guys'
 "These were our guys, they were the heroes who brought down the Soviet empire, and now they've come home to cause problems, and not just in Saudi Arabia," said a Saudi Government official. "There's a lot of anger among them. There is a permanent war going on in their minds."
Anthony H. Cordesman, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, who recently completed a study of Saudi security, says America too has reason for regret. "I don't think it's fair to say that this is America's doing -- the Saudi Government was very enthusiastic about this policy of sending young men off to Afghanistan -- but we do have to take at least some of the blame," he said. "I don't think the United States realized what the consequences might be."
The foreign foot soldiers of the Afghan war have now been linked to terrorist attacks across the Arab world, from Algeria to Egypt to Saudi Arabia, and also in the United States, where veterans of the fighting in Afghanistan were convicted of involvement in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York.
After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the United States and Saudi Arabia poured in billions of dollars of arms and equipment to support the Muslim tribesmen who called themselves mujahadeen (holy warriors), in their fight against the Soviet-backed regime. Military trainers were sent by the Central Intelligence Agency to the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
With Washington's blessing, the Saudi Government encouraged young men to prove their religious devotion by joining the fight, and an estimated 8,000 young Saudis -- most of them poor and uneducated -- went off to the Afghan battlefields. When the Soviet troops withdrew in 1989, the Americans and the Saudis shut down their aid programs.
 
 
 
No End to Chaos
 But the end of the war did not mean the end of the chaos, as factions of the mujahadeen began to fight among themselves. And if there was any loyalty to the United States or Saudi Arabia for their support of the rebels, it evaporated as the faction leaders quarreled over who could be the most xenophobic and violent in the defense of Islam.
The American military trainers left the border. But in a land flooded with weapons and guerrillas who knew how to use them, the military training centers remained open -- schools for another generation of Muslim soldiers, who wanted to learn how to lead a jihad back home.
In Saudi Arabia, their fight appears to have begun with the bombing in Riyadh last November, and many suspect it continued with the explosion at the Khobar Towers apartment complex last month. It is at least possible that the terrorists were trained in Afghanistan by Americans or, more likely, by Pakistanis or Afghans who had worked with the C.I.A.
Mr. Cordesman and others who study the region are quick to note that the situation in Saudi Arabia was already ripe for unrest, if only because of the near-collapse of the Saudi economy and the resulting 40 percent unemployment rate among young Saudi men -- the very men the Government had encouraged to go off to Afghanistan to fight.
The jihad against the Saudi Government and its American allies may have only just begun. A militant Saudi dissident, Osama Bin Laden, warned last week that the terrorists who carried out the recent attacks were planning new bombings.
 
 
 
The 'Main Enemy'
 The bombers will continue to "hit their main enemy, which is the Americans," said Mr. Bin Laden, the scion of a wealthy Saudi trading family. Ousted a few weeks ago from Sudan, which acted under pressure from the United States and Egypt, he issued his warnings from his new base of operations: Afghanistan. "The safest place in the world for me," he said, "is Afghanistan."

HEADLINE: Scratch 'n' Spend;
Muting the Lotteries' Perfect Pitch

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
A RECESSION, layoffs and economic dislocations have made these punishing times in California, but the state government spends millions of dollars broadcasting a simple piece of advice for helping people deal with the stress: play the lottery.
"Just when the curtain's down on your luck, good luck could make a comeback," the state says in one ad. Another sounds a warning on the consequences of not buying lottery tickets: "Everybody gets lucky sooner or later, so don't take any chances." 
 It's a seductive thought, but one that many politicians are finding increasingly troubling. California is conveying a message that bombards people so relentlessly in so many regions that lotteries have become the most visible face of many state governments.
Thirty-six states, plus the District of Columbia, operated lotteries last year, and they spent $372 million on advertising in the 12-month period that ended June 30, 1995, according to La Fleur's 1996 Lottery World Almanac, a trade publication. That is triple the amount spent a decade ago, making lotteries among the largest and most aggressive advertisers in the country.
 
 
 
Step Right Up
 The pitch is paying off: lottery ticket sales have risen from $9 billion in 1985 to $31.9 billion last year. Of that amount, about $11 billion ended up in state coffers, after covering jackpots and administrative expenses.
What disturbs some people is the fact that the states, armed with these hefty ad budgets, have hired some of the best salesmen in the country to persuade people that, in effect, the government sanctions gambling as a short cut to happiness, that playing lotto is fun, and that it is a suitable method for financing everything from education to wilderness preservation. The advertising may also be helping the casino industry by legitimizing gambling as a healthy leisure activity.
"Clearly, the acceptance of the state lotteries gave a credibility to gambling and took away some of the stigma," said Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr., president of the American Gaming Association and a former chairman of the Republican Party. "This was the state government involved. That gave it a respectability it might not have had otherwise."
The lotteries have been a boon for cash-strapped state governments, but many legislators are having qualms about the brazen promise of easy money. "It has always bothered me to hold up the prospect of instant riches," Gov. George E. Pataki of New York said in April, and he ordered lottery officials to emphasize instead the funds flowing into education. (One former ad said: "We Won't Stop Until Everyone's a Millionaire.") A recent Colorado television ad showed some handsome scenery -- the state's lottery supports parks -- and carried the lines: "Open space. Never to be developed. Purchased with your lottery dollars."
The Massachusetts state legislature has taken among the most drastic steps, slashing the lottery's advertising budget from $12 million a few years ago to $400,000 this year. Virginia forbids its lottery from sending direct mailings to targeted customers. Minnesota prohibits ads that encourage playing the lottery as a means of relieving personal financial problems, that laud winners or denigrate those who do not play.
Working at cross purposes to these good intentions is the fact that many states, voracious for lottery dollars and realizing that new games must be introduced to keep the money flowing, are bringing out newer, faster games, and are spending heavily to promote them.
But what is now gaining increasing attention is not just the propriety of the government urging people to wager frequently -- particularly since research shows that poorer people are often the heaviest purchasers of lottery tickets -- but the almost total lack of regulation over the advertising. Some experts maintain that this has made state governments the unwitting torchbearers for one of the country's most lucrative industries: casino gambling.
The reason is that the states are exempt from Federal laws that prohibit certain kinds of casino advertising. Casinos can advertise their entertainment or recreational operations but, unlike the states or Indian-owned casinos, they are prohibited from mentioning or displaying wagering itself. No cards, dice or roulette wheels, and certainly no claims of the riches awaiting those who play.
The states are even exempt from Federal truth-in-advertising laws, which might force lotteries to disclose the fact that the odds of winning -- typically millions to one -- and the total winnings paid out are lower than in just about any other game. The states pay out roughly 50 percent to 60 percent of the income from ticket sales in jackpots. By contrast, Las Vegas slot machines generally pay out more than 95 percent, and table games 85 percent or more. "The lottery is the worst game in terms of payout, but it is the dream bet," said William Thompson, a professor of public policy at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. "That's why it is ideal for the poor person."
This imbalance has produced two unanticipated but important consequences. One is that many experts credit state lottery advertising for having made possible the rapid spread of casino gambling over the last seven years. The states, these experts argue, sanitized the once-unseemly image of the casinos. "Lotteries did pave the way for other forms of gambling across the country, no question," said David Gale, president of the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. "The idea of combining gambling and government has created great acceptance."
The second consequence is that there have been several legal challenges that might result in a lifting of the ban on casino advertising. In the principal case, a Las Vegas television station argued that the Federal prohibition was unconstitutional because it violated its First Amendment rights. A Federal District Court ruled in the station's favor several years ago, and an appeals court is expected to hand down its ruling soon.
Several legal experts said the prospect of a victory for the casinos was greatly enhanced recently when the Supreme Court struck down a Rhode Island law that had banned liquor stores from advertising prices. "We lived with this prohibition because, for a while, no one else could advertise either," said Janet Rogers, who argued the case for the TV station. "But when everyone else was permitted to do it, we decided enough is enough. This is extremely discriminatory, and that's the issue."
Ultimately, the reason the lotteries advertise so heavily, and that casinos are fighting for the right, is because it works. Sam DiPhillipo, head of the Massachusetts lottery, said his state's drastic cuts would undoubtedly hurt: "It is my belief that, while it won't have an immediate effect, long term it will have a real impact. Jackpot awareness is everything in this business."

HEADLINE: The World;
Poland's Leader Leaves A Marxist Past Behind

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WARSAW

 BODY:
WHEN Aleksander Kwasniewski went to Washington for his first visit as Poland's President last week, he had one overall objective: to dispel the loaded tag-line, "ex-Communist."
Neither the Western-style election campaign with which he unseated Lech Walesa last November nor the general perception that Mr. Kwasniewski's pre-1989 Communism was more pragmatic than ideological had dislodged skepticism in the United States. 
 After all, Mr. Walesa, the lion of freedom, was everyone's favorite abroad, even though he had become a rancorous, divisive and bullying figure at home.
But with early visits to Paris, Bonn and NATO headquarters in Brussels, followed by an adeptly handled trip to Moscow, the telegenic Mr. Kwasniewski (pronounced kvash-NYEF-skee), 41, quickly was embraced in Europe as its style of social democrat. Europe accepted His explanation of his past -- that his roots reflected a political expediency and a desire to reform the Communist Party from within.
Now it seems as if he may have succeeded in being accepted that way in Washington, too.
 
 
 
Eyeing the Future
 "If a country has changed fundamentally from the ground up like Poland has, Kwasniewski's political world is going to change too," said a White House official who saw the new President operate in Washington. "You're going to have to be a social democrat or be marginalized. Kwasniewski's emphasis is on the future, the future, the future."
Americans are coming to understand, the official added, how significant it is that the victories of former Communists in Poland, Hungary and Lithuania were achieved through democratic elections. In all these countries, ex-Communists are governing with an eye to the next elections, trying to balance the demands of older constituents who hanker for the social security of the past and the desires of the more confident, younger voters who yearn for future growth under capitalism.
To the surprise of many, Mr. Walesa paved the way for his successor's smooth landing in Washington.
The anti-Communist former President had been zealous in his hostility to Mr. Kwasniewski during and after the election. But the ex-President prides himself as a Polish patriot above all, and he realized that bad-mouthing Mr. Kwasniewski as a "red spider" (as he has called him at home) wouldn't do Poland's image any good.
Last month in Chicago, Mr. Walesa preached tolerance to a gathering of Polish-Americans, a conservatively inclined group that has generally opposed Mr. Kwasniewski. When he was reprimanded for having handed over power to a former Communist, Mr. Walesa appealed to his supporters to remember that Mr. Kwasniewski had been chosen in fair elections. Democracy, Mr. Walesa said, was what the Solidarity movement had fought for. What did you want me to do, he asked: hang on to power like the dictators Fidel Castro in Cuba and Kim Il Sung in North Korea?
And at the White House, Mr. Walesa told President Clinton that Poland under Mr. Kwasniewski could be trusted as a reliable ally. With that recommendation, the new leader had a more comfortable platform for his pitch about Poland's desire to join NATO. The Clinton Administration has made it clear that when NATO decides to expand (as is expected next year), Poland will be among the new members.
But this was Mr. Kwasniewski's first opportunity to present the case himself, and he chose a sophisticated approach, according to an Administration official. Instead of stressing the threat of Russia -- which is actually much of the appeal of NATO for the Polish people -- the new President emphasized that Polish membership could help unite Europe. He told Mr. Clinton that Poland wanted to be an equal European partner in NATO, with the responsibilities that imposes.
"His mantra was very clever: he said Ronald Reagan brought down the evil empire, George Bush helped unite Germany and Bill Clinton could unite Europe," said the Administration official.
Mr. Kwasniewski has, in fact, worked hard to see that Poland has a tenable case as a member of a united Europe. One standard set down by NATO last year for aspiring members was a functioning free-market economy, alongside a democratic political system. When Mr. Kwasniewski's party, the Left Democratic Alliance, won parliamentary elections three years ago, economic reforms begun under the anti-Communists continued. And as President, Mr. Kwasniewski has gone out of his way to court foreign investors.
So when he met with Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor and addressed the American Chamber of Commerce he had an upbeat message: Growth was seven percent last year, the strongest in Europe. The private sector accounts for about 60 percent of Poland's economy. The middle class is growing, fueling a consumer boom for dishwashers, mountain bikes, electronics and, most of all, cars. Buying on credit, a stark indicator of a middle-class mentality, is taking off.
On Capitol Hill, Mr. Kwasniewski stressed that Poland was not interested in NATO for a free lunch, and wanted to carry the burdens. Already, he said, Poland has reached out to its neighbors to the east, in particular Ukraine, which Washington would like to see knit into Europe rather than into the Russian fold.
With the argument of capitalist Poland as a responsible European neighbor, Mr. Kwasniewski probably went far in obliterating his Communist past and in the meantime winning some votes in the Senate that Poland will need when it comes to approving an expanded NATO.

HEADLINE: Greenspan, the Oracle;
An Economy Waits for the Magic Words

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
NEARLY every sentence uttered in public by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is parsed, as soon as it leaves his lips, for clues to the direction of interest rates. On Thursday morning, those who track monetary policy will be listening particularly intently when Mr. Greenspan outlines his views on the economy to a Congressional committee.
Never mind that Mr. Greenspan's statements can be so elliptical as to obscure the Fed's intentions. With the economy running at a surprisingly strong clip, the markets increasingly jumpy and unemployment so low that employers might have to push up wages, analysts will be searching for any signal that the Fed will raise rates this summer to avert a possible surge in inflation. 
 It is a ritualized process that Mr. Greenspan knows well after nearly nine years as head of the central bank, and one he manages with great care.
In this case he will sit, patiently professorial, before a group of deferential if occasionally befuddled Senators who will do their best to follow his dense analysis and tortured syntax.
Consider this, from Mr. Greenspan's appearance before the Senate Banking Committee in February:
"And I think where the confusion arises is the fact that you cannot view monetary policy as a sort of simple issue of, if the most probable outcome is coming out of this soft patch into moderate growth with low inflation, which I think is the most probable outcome, that is not the same statement as saying that you therefore, in the process of implementing monetary policy or formulating it, I should say, completely disregard what the upsides and downsides of a potential outcome may be."
 
 
 
Attention Is Paid
 Still, journalists will bark his key phrases into mobile phones. Wall Street traders will follow his testimony live on television and computer screens. A single word from him, even an inflection, can send the financial markets stampeding.
But there is much more to Mr. Greenspan's relationship with the markets than verbal artistry. For just as he can roil or calm investors with a few syllables, the markets can make Mr. Greenspan's job considerably harder or easier.
Mr. Greenspan's considerable influence over the economy derives not so much from any direct control of interest rates -- the Fed can only nudge up and down two relatively obscure short-term rates -- but from his credibility with his most important audience, the bond market.
It is the bond market, after all, that sets the long-term rates that really matter to the behavior of companies, individuals and entire economies, including those that are benchmarks for mortgages and business and car loans. And bond investors hate nothing more than inflation, which inexorably erodes the value of their holdings.
"Even the central bank in the most powerful economy in the world is subject more than before to the discipline of the global financial markets," said David M. Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York investment firm.
Some economists go so far as to describe Mr. Greenspan as a financial Wizard of Oz -- seemingly all-powerful but in reality dependent on nothing more than the his subjects' willingness to believe in him.
To a large degree, they remain more or less in step with him because they share his goal: a stable, low-inflation environment. Yet even with his strong inflation-fighting record, Mr. Greenspan cannot take the markets for granted.
He generally tries in his cryptic way to warn the markets during his public statements of any impending change in policy, yet he clearly likes to keep his options open to deal with rapid changes in the economy -- all of which is one reason he appears so equivocal.
 
 
 
A Failure to Communicate
 The relationship between the Fed and the markets does not always work smoothly. In early 1994, a booming bond market had pushed interest rates to very low levels, contributing to a surge in economic growth and an attendant increase in inflationary pressures. Mr. Greenspan sent the markets what in retrospect was a clear warning, stating publicly that a rate increase was a question of when, not if. But when he did raise rates shortly afterward to keep inflation from infecting the economy, the markets were shell-shocked, and bond prices went into a yearlong swoon.
The markets have had a hard time this year reading the economy and the intentions of Mr. Greenspan and his fellow policy makers on the Federal Reserve Board and at the regional Federal Reserve Banks. For years, many economists and Fed officials considered it an article of faith that when unemployment fell below 6 percent, signs of inflation would soon appear.
But unemployment has been below 6 percent for nearly two years -- it is currently at a six-year low of 5.3 percent -- and there are no consistent signs that consumer prices are rising faster than their modest 3 percent rate of the last several years. Mr. Greenspan, who is not all-powerful within the Fed but holds considerable sway, appears to some colleagues and acquaintances to be engaged in an intellectual reappraisal of the American economy's capacity for non-inflationary growth, and to be unusually tentative in his conclusions about whether to change policy.
Monetary policy decisions in coming months will also be complicated by the fact that this is a Presidential election year. While the Fed has proven willing to raise rates during an election campaign -- it last did so in 1988 -- it prefers to remain on the sidelines.
Still, Mr. Greenspan and the markets seem to be of a similar mind at the moment. Since March, when it became clear that the economy was growing at a pace far stronger than analysts had anticipated and increasing the risk that inflationary pressures could take root, the bond markets have sent interest rates sharply higher, acting as a brake on the economy. The markets, in effect, are doing the Fed's job for it, allowing Mr. Greenspan some extra time before deciding whether to reverse a series of cuts that began a year ago.
Implicit in its unstated bargain with the markets, though, is that the Fed will move swiftly to raise the rates it controls as soon as inflation does become a threat. Many economists think that will happen no later than the Fed's next monetary policy meeting, on Aug. 20 -- right between the Republican and Democratic conventions.
"As soon as they begin to get hints of inflation, the markets respond rather strongly and do some of the Fed's work for it," said Lyle E. Gramley, a former Federal Reserve Board Governor. "But if the economy were to continue to show the strength we've seen in recent numbers and the Fed did not respond, there would be a significant loss of credibility at stake."

HEADLINE: At Meeting in Moscow, Gore Is to Urge Russian Reform

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore will urge President Boris N. Yeltsin to capitalize on the mandate for reform that he won with his re-election when the two men meet in Moscow, probably on Monday, American officials said this week. Mr. Gore is to arrive in Moscow tonight.
He and about half the United States Cabinet will be in Moscow on Monday and Tuesday for the seventh in a series of semi-annual meetings with their Russian counterparts, led by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who has been renominated to his post by Mr. Yeltsin. 
 Mr. Gore, while protesting that "I'm not a doctor," will be the first American official to spend much time with Mr. Yeltsin since the Russian's health problems stopped him from campaigning at the end of the long election campaign. President Clinton, who spoke with Mr. Yeltsin on the telephone on July 5, said the Russian "sounded so good" that he "didn't have to ask him about his health."
But Mr. Yeltsin's energy level and capacity for hard work are open questions, and American officials hope that a chance for real reform of Russia's institutions and legal structure will not be squandered by a President known for his long retreats after crises are passed.
"While there are many rough spots ahead, this meeting takes place in an atmosphere of more optimism than any other," Mr. Gore said on Friday.
It will be the first meeting of what has come to be known as the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission "when we can say that Russia is not facing an imminent risk of sliding into hyperinflation," Mr. Gore said.
The Vice President refused to suggest that Mr. Yeltsin should renege on his generous campaign promises, which could break the Russian budget, saying with a grin that such decisions, "so characteristic of democracies," were up to the Russians.
It is by no means clear that Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin agree on short-term economic policy, however, with Mr. Yeltsin going on television on Wednesday to say that fighting inflation was no longer a top priority. Mr. Chernomyrdin is said to favor a retightening of belts, while the International Monetary Fund's representative in Moscow, Thomas Wolfe, said it was time for Russia to "attend to the budget and raise revenues" as soon as possible to remain within I.M.F. guidelines for a $10.2 billion loan.
One of Mr. Yeltsin's economic advisers, Aleksandr Livshits, has spoken of forthcoming decrees and measures to abolish tax concessions and to crack down on corporate tax evasion, while Mr. Yeltsin promises to keep factories open, stimulate production and restore savings and pensions that have been diminished by inflation.
Mr. Gore was upbeat. "In the wake of the election," he said, "I have no doubt that Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin will continue on the reform path."
NATO expansion will also be a topic, Mr. Gore said, noting that "we've seen a lower profile where Russian statements and concerns are involved." Other difficult issues, like Russian sales of nuclear reactors to Iran, will also come up.
But the main work of the meetings is to bring Cabinet members on both sides together to go over issues from disarmament to trade and taxation of foreign companies investing in Russia.
The Energy Secretary, Hazel O'Leary, will discuss nuclear issues with her counterpart, Viktor Mikhailov, in particular the conversion of some Russian nuclear reactors from using plutonium. The Health and Human Services Secretary, Donna Shalala, will discuss cooperation on fighting diseases like diphtheria and alcohol abuse, and seek better access to the Russian market for American-made drugs.
Defense Secretary William J. Perry will discuss the conversion of chemical-weapons factories and Russian research into biological weapons. But since Mr. Yeltsin dismissed his Defense Minister, Pavel S. Grachev, replacing him temporarily with the Chief of Staff, Gen. Mikhail Kolesnikov, it is not clear how much substance the discussions will have.
Mr. Gore and his party will also meet Aleksandr I. Lebed, Mr. Yeltsin's new and outspoken chairman of the National Security Council.

THE STATES AND THE ISSUES

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

 BODY:

California
Brown May Have Last Laugh Yet
Willie Brown has now been gone from the California State Assembly for the better part of a year. But his machinations linger on. 
 Mr. Brown, a Democrat who served as Speaker of the nation's most powerful and important state legislative body for a record 15 years, was forced by term limits to abandon Sacramento, though he deftly managed to land on his feet as Mayor of San Francisco.
Just before he left the capital for the City by the Bay, the Republicans, as a parting shot, finally came up with enough votes to gain control of the 80-seat Assembly for the first time in almost 20 years. But before they could formally take over, the unsinkable Mr. Brown, as his own parting shot and Machiavellian gesture, stole away a couple of the Republicans' wavering members and snatched back control.
Then he rewarded one of the heretics, Doris Allen of Huntington Beach, with the title (but not the real power) of Speaker. Still later, in a confusing game of musical chairs, he tapped another of the heretics, Brian Setencich of Fresno, to succeed her.
Furious Republican leaders successfully mounted a campaign to have Ms. Allen recalled in a special election, and replaced her with a solidly faithful party member, thereby narrowly regaining effective control of the Assembly, Mr. Brown having left for San Francisco. Then when Mr. Setencich sought re-election, the party spent heavily in the spring primary and denied him the nomination, giving the nod instead to a political unknown, Robert Prenter Jr.
Now, as though straight from the Willie Brown play book, Mr. Setencich is undertaking some machinations of his own, bent on sweet revenge.
The Democrats have nominated no candidate to take on Mr. Prenter in November. So Mr. Setencich, scenting opportunity, plans in the fall to wage a ballot write-in campaign in hopes of regaining his old seat.
He'll make a concerted appeal to Democratic voters. Should he succeed, and should control of the Assembly, post-election, once again come down to a narrow vote or two, Republicans may once again find themselves cursing Willie Brown -- and wondering whether he might have left his heart in Sacramento.
 
Initiatives
A Hot Voter Issue Is How to Hunt
Most ballot initiatives deal with heavy-duty social and economic issues -- affirmative action, gay rights, city charters, taxes. But this fall, a number of state ballots around the country will also include initiatives that deal with hunting rights, an issue that in recent years has begun to add some political steam to its always-present emotional wrench.
Increasingly, groups like the National Rifle Association and the Humane Society of the United States, along with conservation groups, are focusing their considerable organizational, monetary and political resources on the ancient debate over how much game should be taken and with what equipment and methods. At issue, now, is the particularly controversial use of leg traps, dogs and bait to take such animals as bear, cougar, bobcat and lynx.
In initiative votes over the past two years, conservation and animal rights groups in Oregon managed to ban the use of dogs and bait in bear and cougar hunting, while in an initiative vote in California, conservation and animal rights forces managed to retain a ban on the hunting of mountain lions.
This fall, Oregon hunters and sportsmen, better organized now, will attempt again, via an initiative, to win approval of the use of dogs and bait in bear and cougar hunting.
In Idaho, by contrast, conservationists and animal rights supporters have managed to get an initiative on the ballot that would end not only the use of dogs and bait in bear hunting but also would do away with the spring bear-hunting season.
Alaskans will be asked to vote on whether to outlaw the use of airplanes to hunt wolves and whether to require hunters who have flown to a hunting site to delay a day before actually firing at a wolverine, fox or lynx.
In Colorado and Massachusetts, animal rights groups and conservationists are collecting petition signatures for an initiative that would ban leg-hold traps and snares in hunting, while in Michigan and Washington, other conservation and animal rights groups are pushing for a ballot item that would ban the use of bait and dogs in bear hunting.
Generally speaking, for conservationists and animal rights groups, these fights tend mainly to turn on "responsible" bag limits and humane hunting methods.
Hunters and sporting groups, on the other hand, often contend that conservationists and animal rights groups overstate their case and, at heart, want to impose so many hunting regulations that going into the field will not be worth the shot and powder it takes.
 
Indiana
Steamrollering Big Government
When Representative David McIntosh, a conservative Republican from Muncie, Ind., first arrived in Washington two years ago, Speaker Newt Gingrich sensed immediately that he was an ideological soul mate, a committed enemy of Big Brother government. He took the freshman legislator under his wing.
Soon, Mr. McIntosh became chairman of the subcommittee on regulatory affairs of the House Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee.
Roll 'em back, Mr. Gingrich instructed Mr. McIntosh.
He has, with vigor.
Just the other day, for example, he moved to gut a Federal regulation that requires anyone laying asphalt on a Federal highway to wear long pants.
Fresh asphalt is very hot, and a splash or two on a leg can have real bite. Still, employees of E&B Paving of Anderson, Ind., were willing to put their legs at risk as, under a broiling Midwestern summer sun a few weeks back, they laid down a stretch of blacktop along Interstate 69, near Muncie.
Could they wear short pants, they beseeched the crew boss.
No way, he shot back, recalling that a couple of years ago E&B was fined $2,400 by Federal safety inspectors because some asphalt workers were caught in short pants.
Someone wrote his Congressman.
And now Mr. McIntosh is drawing up a bill.
"This is yet another example of red tape that may make some sense to a bureaucrat in an air-conditioned office in Washington," he says, punching the asphalt-hot inside-the-Beltway button. "If the employees say it's safer to handle asphalt in shorts, I trust their judgment. This isn't rocket science." B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
In what has become his own weekly radio address, Bob Dole today sought to capitalize on the Republican Party's historic image as the party of cutting taxes. He said it was "high time for a fairer, flatter and simpler" tax system, although he did not make a specific proposal, adding that the 1040 tax form should "go the way of the Berlin Wall."
"I believe you should be able to file your tax return on a postcard, or electronically, without paper at all," he said. "And, above all, I am guided by the belief that our tax code should recognize that a family's most important responsibility is raising children and not supporting the bureaucracy in Washington." 
 Mr. Dole, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, has been speaking in the time allotted the Republicans for responding to President Clinton's weekly radio message. Taking over the radio response has given Mr. Dole an official outlet, now that he has left the Senate to campaign full time for President.
The two campaigns are embroiled in an advertising war over which party has cut taxes the most. Mr. Dole today laid out the Republican case, saying that Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax increase was the largest in history. But if adjusted for inflation, it was less than the tax increase enacted under President Ronald Reagan in 1982.
Mr. Dole went on to list the tax cuts enacted by the current Republican Congress but vetoed by President Clinton: a $500-a-child tax credit, a reduction in the estate tax, a reduction in the marriage-penalty tax, a reduction in the capital gains tax rate, creation of a tax credit for adoptions and a tax credit for long-term care of family members.
He said that under President Clinton, Americans were sending more of their paychecks to Washington. "Taxes are now so high that, according to the National Tax Foundation, the typical American family pays more in Federal, state and local taxes than it spends on food, clothing and housing combined," he said.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: POLITICAL MEMO;
Dole's Free-Form Style Upsets Campaign Plans

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Bob Dole's Presidential campaign has taken to keeping a political calendar detailing the themes Mr. Dole will address each day. Last Saturday was juvenile crime day, Wednesday was reserved for welfare reform, and the topic for Thursday was the United States' relations with Israel.
All of which would have been hard to tell from watching Mr. Dole campaign these past few weeks. From attacking the president of the N.A.A.C.P. to trying to back off his opposition on an assault weapons ban, Mr. Dole has kept his own calendar -- often to the detriment of his campaign. 
 If there is a grand strategy behind all this, neither he nor his aides have been able to explain it. But in his seemingly free-form campaign, Mr. Dole has often found his political calendar set not by his aides but by the questions posed by reporters, who are often encouraged by the White House to bring up certain issues. And he has embroiled himself in the kind of issues that Presidential candidates with Mr. Dole's level of experience usually try to avoid.
All of this has caused obvious dismay among even his own staff, anxious over signs that the candidate and the campaign are adrift, squandering opportunities in the dwindling time left before the Republican convention.
A host of reasons are given for Mr. Dole's recent difficulties, and they involve what Mr. Dole's concerned associates see as shortcomings both of the candidate and his campaign staff. (Most of Mr Dole's aides, aware of the candidate's distaste at seeing his advisers' names in the newspapers, would not agree to be quoted).
As for the candidate, Mr. Dole seems to be having difficulty adjusting from the transition of being Senate majority leader to being a candidate for President. Used to Congress, where he fired off his views with an edgy wit to a regular group of reporters who enjoyed his style, Mr. Dole now seems caught off guard by how a stray remark on an airplane tarmac can become front-page news.
This was particularly clear the past month, as Mr. Dole seemed to work through the fine points of his party's anti-abortion plank in television interviews, almost as if he were still wrestling through legislative differences in the privacy of the Senate cloakroom.
A second factor for Mr. Dole is that he continues to chafe at the modern ways of campaigning -- from using a prompter to disciplining himself to talk in short phrases designed for the news -- pressed upon him by his campaign staff, most of whom, while experienced political operatives, are still decades younger than he is.
Finally, Mr. Dole, in his associates' view, has yet to find a theme to unify his campaign and explain to the public why he wants to be President. This has helped to create the vacuum that has allowed unwanted topics, like Mr. Dole's chance remarks about tobacco, to dominate Mr. Dole's days.
Mr. Dole's campaign staff poses an entirely different set of complications for the candidate. He is surrounded almost entirely by political professionals, as opposed to people who have a grounded loyalty to the candidate or ideology. By comparison, President Clinton was carried in 1992 by a foundation of advisers who shared his centrist political approach.
It was nearly unheard of in 1992 for Mr. Clinton's political advisers to disparage the candidate to a reporter. That is not the case for Mr. Dole. His aides have increasingly taken to pointing out his shortcomings, not to undercut him, but because they want to do in the newspapers what they have been unable to do in his presence: Prod Mr. Dole to change his ways.
That explained the wave of aides complaining about how Mr. Dole would not follow the teleprompter. And after Mr. Dole gave what his own aides described as a "confusing" speech on assault weapons, the candidate's associates prodded reporters to ask him again about the topic, in hopes he would say off the stage what he was supposed to say on it. (He did not.)
Many officials in the Dole campaign learned Presidential politics while working for candidates like Ronald Reagan and Jack F. Kemp. Both of those men were more amenable to the kind of campaign script that dominates American politics today, like remembering to smile or pointing up at the balloons when they drop at a rally.
Mr. Dole has never taken to such instructions, but since many in his campaign are relatively new, they are regularly surprised when he, for example, simply ignores presumably newsworthy lines that have been inserted into his text.
"Half the campaign still thinks they're working for Jack Kemp," one of Mr. Dole's associates said on Friday. "The other half still thinks they're working for Ronald Reagan. And very few people still seem to understand they're really working for Bob Dole."
Some inside Mr. Dole's campaign believe that by the time of the convention, none of this will matter. By then, he will have presumably chosen a running-mate, and will release an economic plan, which will include tax cuts, and which will give the campaign the center of gravity his aides sometimes worry is missing.
But others believe that this period is important, and that public opinions are now beginning to set. Mr. Clinton and Ross Perot were able to make a public case for themselves in 1992, largely because they were unknown. Mr. Dole, by contrast, has been in public life more than three decades, which may mean his window for convincing people to take another look at him will be that much smaller.
There are signs that Mr. Dole is trying to change his ways. His staff has been repeatedly distressed at Mr. Dole's willingness to answer questions from reporters about topics that have only caused him trouble. Thus, it was a small moment when he posed for a picture with foreign policy advisers on Friday and he cut off a questioner who began to ask him if he had the discipline to run for President. "We're here talking about this meeting," he said.
That said, Mr. Dole has been in politics for 35 years. This is his third run for the Presidency. And no matter the lackings of his political style, his aides are becoming increasingly certain of one thing: Little can been done to alter it.
"Dole is Dole," one associate said. "And it's futile to try to change him. You recognize his positives and you recognize his challenges. The staff's job is to maximize one and minimize the other. And I think we will."

HEADLINE: James Plinton Jr., 81; Broke Color Barriers at U.S. Airlines

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS 

 BODY:
James O. Plinton Jr., one of the first blacks to be named an executive in the airline industry, eventually becoming a vice president at Eastern Airlines, died on July 4. He was 81 years old.
Mr. Plinton, who spent most of his life trying to break down the strong barriers that blacks faced in the airline industry in the 1940's and 1950's, died of cancer at the Lake Wales Medical Center Extended Care Facility in Lake Wales, Fla., said to his daughter, Kathryn Plinton Roman. 
 She said that even as a youth, Mr. Plinton was fascinated by aviation. When he rode in the rumble seat of his father's Model T Ford, he wore a pair of goggles and pretended he was piloting a plane.
Mr. Plinton was born in Westfield, N.J., on July 22, 1914. He had his first major run-in with the color line as a young boy when he was denied membership in the Westfield Y.M.C.A. and told that he was not allowed to use the swimming pool.
After becoming a successful executive in the airline industry, he was elected president of the national Y.M.C.A.
Mr. Plinton's father wanted him to pursue a medical career, and Mr. Plinton graduated from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania with a bachelor's degree in biology.
He worked in the post office and the merchant marine but then pursued his passion for flying by entering the University of Newark's Division of Aeronautics, where he earned a commercial pilot's license and flight instructor's rating.
He went on to the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and joined the flight training staff of the United States Army Air Corps as one of the first black flight instructors of the 99th Pursuit Squadron.
He trained about 150 pilots, many of whom saw action in World War II and became known as the Tuskegee Airmen.
Mr. Plinton tried repeatedly to be hired as a pilot by major airlines in the 1940's and 1950's. He was turned down by an industry that had a strong bias against hiring blacks as pilots and flight attendants but allowed some blacks to become ground crew workers.
Mrs. Roman said her father was not one to bring discrimination complaints or lawsuits. He persisted in pursuing a career in the industry, though, and after World War II, he turned to airlines outside the United States.
Mr. Plinton helped organize Andesa, the national airline of Ecuador. He also helped Haitian International Airlines.
His big break came in August 1957 when, through the intervention of a pilot and friend, he was able to get an interview at Trans World Airlines. He was appointed executive assistant to the director of personnel and industrial relations, a position that helped him bring other blacks into the industry.
This was the first time that a black had been named to an executive position by a major airline. Mr. Plinton then called the breakthrough a "fabulous opportunity."
In 1971, Mr. Plinton moved to Eastern Airlines, where he was appointed a vice president, then the highest position achieved by a black person in the industry. When Mr. Plinton retired in 1980, Frank Borman, the chairman of Eastern, asked him to stay on as a special assistant for a year.
After his retirement, he remained active as executive director of the Metropolitan Fellowship of Churches in Florida and chairman of the Tacolcy Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit group of black business and professional leaders.
Mr. Plinton's wife, Kathryn Hancock Plinton, died in 1993. In addition to his daughter, Mrs. Roman of Lake Wales, Fla., he is surivived by a son, James O. Norman Plinton of Miami.

HEADLINE: Perspectives;
On the Playing Fields of Flanders

BYLINE: By JANE LEAVY; Jane Leavy, a former sportswriter for The Washington Post, is finishing her second novel.

 BODY:
On the way to the battlefield they stopped to buy wooden shoes. The 14 American women of the 1920 United States Olympic team, their chaperones and an Army driver were going sightseeing in the killing fields of Flanders where, the poet wrote, poppies grow.
But there were no flowers. Or trees. Or grass. Nothing living at all. Just mud reaching as far as the horizon. It was less than two years after the signing of the Armistice. Europe's Champs de Bataille, or Avenue of Battle, as Belgium is still known, was struggling to return to the land of the living. Ypres, the site of some of the bloodiest fighting, had not been completely cleared of weapons or body parts. But it had become a macabre tourist attraction. 
 "Come visit the battlefields of Liberated Belgium!" beckoned a full-page ad in a pre-Olympic sports magazine.
And so they went. Aileen Riggin was 14 years old, the youngest member of the United States team, when she won the gold medal in springboard diving. She remembers how her feet, shod in the heavy wooden shoes, kept sinking into the mud. And how oil glistened on the surface, making rainbows out of devastation. "It was rather pretty actually," she said.
She remembers this too: Her feet were killing her.
"They warned us the battlefield was a mess," she said recently from her home in Honolulu. "We were allowed to wander around at will. My feet hurt like crazy because they told us to buy the shoes big. The peasants in the fields stuffed them with straw and woolen socks. We didn't know about that. We limped around, peeking in pill boxes and trenches, picking up things, souvenirs we shouldn't have had -- German helmets and cartridge cases, shells.
"I picked up a boot and dropped it immediately. The boot had been occupied."
That eighth grader from Brooklyn is 90 years old now and the oldest living female American Olympic champion, a fate, she notes, "I won't have to bear much longer."
She celebrated her birthday in May by winning six gold medals under her married name, Aileen Riggin Soule, at the United States Masters Swimming Short Course Championships in Cupertino, Calif. She will be in Atlanta for the Games starting tomorrow, where she is among those celebrated in the Olympic Woman exhibition.
She quit diving some 30 years ago because of a detached retina. But she still swims a mile every other day. Her times, she says, are a state secret. Her memories are not. They are virtually all that remain of the 1920 Olympics.
The Great War hovered over the Games. They were awarded to Belgium in homage to its losses and in hopes of reviving its war-ravaged economy. "Belgium was on its knees," said Marc Maes, a member of the 1996 Belgian Olympic Committee. "Well, then, it is always on its knees."
The Belgians had a year and a half to prepare for the Games, which lasted from April to September, combining winter and summer events. They were left $23,000 in debt. For Riggin, it was a grand adventure. For the Belgians, "it was a financial debacle," said Roland Renson, author of "The Reborn Games" and chairman of the Sports Museum of Flanders.
The cornerstone of the Olympic Stadium was laid on July 4, 1919. American soldiers still stationed in Antwerp celebrated by erecting a baseball backstop on the site, the oldest soccer field in Belgium. The Belgians reciprocated by besting their liberators in a tug of war, then an Olympic sport.
When the Games opened a year later, on Aug. 14, the tugs-of-war were still evident in the ruins of the city, and the empty seats of Olympic Stadium. A standing room ticket cost three francs, the equivalent of 50 loaves of bread. The people, in whose honor the Games were staged, stayed away. The few who could afford to come were greeted at the stadium by a plaster statue of a Belgian soldier heaving a grenade.
The United States Olympic team traveled to Antwerp on the Princess Matoika, a rusted old German troop ship that had been handed over to the Americans as a reparation of war. While the athletes waited on the pier to board, the coffins of 1,800 American war dead were unloaded. Dan Ferris, who was secretary-treasurer of the Amateur Athletic Union, said: "The caskets were sitting there on the decks, lines and lines of coffins. The smell of formaldehyde was dreadful. It was a shocking way to start."
The crossing took two weeks, an eternity for the men quartered below in the stinking, rat-infested hold. At night, they sneaked up on deck with their bedding. In the morning, they vied with 13 dressage horses for fresh air, according to several sources, though Riggin has no recollection of the animals. "I'm still troubled about those horses," she said recently. "I don't think I would have forgotten 13 horses on deck."
The athletes tried to train. But the Princess Matoika was small. "We were falling all over each other," Riggin said.
Runners jogged on a cork track laid topside. There were calisthenics on deck but classes were not mandatory and never lasted as long as half an hour. Javelin and discus throwers tied fishing lines and cables to their projectiles and heaved them overboard. "Dick Landon, the high jumper, practiced by trying to kick out deck lights," Riggin said. "The rifle team was tempted but did not succumb to shooting sea gulls."
Swimmers waited in line to take their turn in a pool built out of canvas and two-by-fours, just big enough to hold a single man. The tank was filled by hose with water from the gulf stream. A rope tied around the swimmer's waist held him in place while he raced against the clock. Riggin says divers were lucky to get wet.
When the team finally reached Antwerp, there were no accommodations for the 272 American men. Housing was scarce, a crisis made worse by the arrival of all 2,668 Olympic athletes. American Olympic officials tried to persuade the men to remain on board, precipitating the "Mutiny of Matoika." The men threatened not to compete unless they were allowed off the boat. Officials found them beds, sacks filled with corn husks and straw, in an abandoned schoolhouse. The women stayed in a Y.W.C.A.
The Games opened with a Catholic mass, honoring athletes killed in the war. Later that day, when the white doves of peace were released, an Olympic first, they were greeted with volleys of cannon fire. Gabrielle Goris Cnoops, a daughter-in-law of one of the organizers and a special guest at the opening ceremony, is now 94 years old.
"It was an apotheosis," she said recently in Antwerp. "We were happy to see all those nations together."
Except, of course, the Axis powers, who were not invited.
The Olympic flag made its debut, as did the oath, taken by a Belgian war hero and fencer, Victor Boin. "His voice was firm, like a fencer's," Cnoops said.
Many of the athletes were soldiers and marched in uniform. The American women marched in men's straw boaters stuffed with paper. No one had remembered to bring hats for them. Women's groups outside the stadium protested their exclusion from more "manly" sports.
The swimming and diving competitions were held in the moat that surrounded the ancient city. Spectators, such as they were, sat on benches erected on ancient ramparts. The water was dank, dark and frigid -- welcoming only to rats and frogs. "And the rats swam faster than the men," Maes said.
"We nearly died when we saw what they had for us," Riggin said. "Then, we got in the water where we could have died. It was dangerous, it was so cold. Fifty-two degrees."
There were no hot showers. Riggin remembers several water-polo players being pulled out of the water on the verge of hypothermia and that "the women seemed to be able to handle it better than the men."
Sunlight pierced the surface infrequently. "The water was almost black," Riggin said. "On a sunny day, you could look up and see a glimmer of the sun. On a rainy day, you couldn't see a thing."
And it was always raining. The rain stirred up the sludge and their fears. "You'd be out of breath going down as deep as we did and you'd get fuzzy in the head, disoriented," Riggin said. "I was always scared I'd swim the wrong way."
She didn't practice any more than she had to, especially from the platform, where she finished fifth. It was hard making herself go up the tower and harder staying up there: at 65 pounds she was no match for the wind. "When you hit the water your hands come back and hit your forehead. In practice, we wore sponges to soften the blows. I had a terrific headache the whole time."
She left Antwerp with a gold medal, two German army helmets and a cartridge case. Her journey ended as it began, on a transport ship loaded with the dead. Riggin and her teammate, Helen Wainwright, six weeks older, watched the mournful procession of pine coffins.
"Two little girls standing at the railing, crying," Riggin said. "The soldiers were very gentle with them. They observed all the rules. Each one got a salute."
In the last three quarters of a century, Riggin has skated in the movies with Sonja Henie, swum for Billy Rose's Aquacade and covered sports for the New York Post. She won two more Olympic medals in Paris in 1924, a silver in diving and a bronze in the 100-meter backstroke. Three years later, she toured the States with Gertrude Ederle, the first woman to swim the English Channel. In retrospect, she is not sure which was more terrifying, diving into the moat in Antwerp or into a six-foot-deep glass tank so narrow she had to pull in her arms in order to do a swan dive. For this, she earned $500 a week and was once almost electrocuted.
She has been back to Antwerp twice. But she never saw the Olympic diving venue again. "No one seemed to know where it was," she said.
By 1923, the Belgian Olympic Committee had gone bankrupt. Olympic officials sold every artifact of the 1920 Games -- starter pistols, warmers, chronometers, even their own building -- to help recoup the deficit.
Today, all that remains of the Olympic Stadium is the cornerstone laid in July 1919, hidden in a dank corridor behind a pub in a decaying stadium that is still home to the oldest soccer club in Belgium. The fate of the plaster sculpture of the Belgian soldier remains unknown.

HEADLINE: Moynihan's Tax-Break Bill Could Foil Dreams of Fields

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
At a time when New York City has mounted a major drive for new stadiums for the Yankees and Mets, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan may have thrown a wrench into its efforts with a bill that would eliminate Federal tax breaks for new professional sports arenas.
Mr. Moynihan, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in an interview on Friday that the intent of his bill was to withdraw the Federal Government from the business of underwriting team owners and sports franchises as many teams, like the Yankees, have threatened to relocate unless their host cities build new stadiums. 
 Federal tax subsidies for stadiums, which take the form of tax deductions for people who buy the municipal bonds used to finance construction, would in effect be transferred to educational institutions under Mr. Moynihan's plan. The Senator has introduced another bill that would increase the amount of tax-exempt financing available to medical schools and large, research-oriented universities.
"Taken together, these two bills correct a serious misallocation of our limited resources," said Mr. Moynihan, who introduced both bills on June 17 and provoked immediate protests from cities like Nashville and Pasadena, Calif., where officials said the mere suggestion of eliminating tax breaks forced them to postpone stadium projects.
In New York City, where construction of stadiums for either the Yankees or Mets is at least a year away, the reaction from City Hall has been no less critical.
"We have communicated to the Senator that this is not at all helpful," said John Dyson, chairman of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Council of Economic Advisers, who has led the effort for a new stadium for the Yankees on Manhattan's West Side.
Although the Mayor has not ruled out the renovation of the existing Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, he and George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the Yankees' principal owner, have made clear their preference for a West Side stadium. Consultants estimate its cost at $1.08 billion. Mr. Steinbrenner declined comment on Senator Moynihan's proposal.
Plans for a new Shea Stadium in Flushing, Queens, to cost an estimated $437 million, have won vigorous support from the Mayor, who hopes two new stadiums would attract the Olympic Games to the city in 2008. The new Shea would be built across a parking lot from the existing one.
Senator Moynihan's bills have provoked more muted criticism in Albany. State officials said the proposed cut in Federal tax breaks would undermine any stadium project for the Yankees or the Mets.
"The Senator raises a good question -- whether public funds should be used to subsidize professional sports," said Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. "But the bill needs to be refined. Localities will continue to build stadiums, and this will just make it more expensive."
Mr. Gargano and other officials said Mr. Moynihan's proposal was too broad and would eliminate tax-exempt financing for work on parking lots and other public improvements necessary to accommodate new stadiums. It would also make projects ineligible for tax breaks even when professional sports teams shared stadiums with the public for amateur or recreational events.
Senator Moynihan's bill wouldmake building new stadiums or updating existing ones more costly because tax-exempt municipal bonds have traditionally been the least expensive way to finance large-scale public projects.
Experts said the most likely alternative would be to issue taxable bonds, but since investors would not benefit from tax deductions they would have to be paid higher interest. Mr. Dyson estimated that the interest rate on taxable bonds would be at least two percentage points above the prevailing rate on tax-exempt bonds, with the difference in the tens of millions of dollars.
Senator Moynihan's bill has struck a sensitive chord in cities where officials were preparing over the last month to sell bonds for stadium projects. Nashville, which had planned a $60 million tax-exempt bond sale the first week in July for a new stadium, postponed the sale because of uncertainty over whether bond holders could be assured of tax deductions.
Critics say the Senator's proposal has severely hampered stadium plans across the nation, even though it is not expected to come to a vote in the Senate this year. That is because rules governing the sale of municipal bonds require a pledge that the bonds will always be tax exempt. That assurance cannot now be given. Senator Moynihan's bill, if approved, would be retroactive to the date of its introduction in June. Lawyers on the Senator's staff said they had made the proposal retroactive to prevent a "rush to market" by cities trying to sell bonds ahead of a vote on the bill.
Although frustrated by the timing of Senator Moynihan's proposal, Mr. Dyson and Mr. Gargano dismissed the suggestion that Mr. Moynihan was using it as a political maneuver in an attempt to undermine Republican administrations in New York City and Albany.
"We have great regard for the Senator and usually agree on principle," Mr. Dyson said. "I just wish he would have waited until we got our financing in place before he introduced this bill."
Senator Moynihan said his proposals rested on a long held belief that too much Federal support was being extended to professional sports while university research, particularly at medical schools, was being reduced.
"Professional sports teams are commercial activities and Columbia-Presbyterian is not," he said. "Universities are where the brain stuff comes from, and that is what deserves our support."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Send Holbrooke to Discuss Indicted Bosnian Serb Leaders

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 13

 BODY:
Richard C. Holbrooke, the Clinton Administration's former chief negotiator in the Balkans, will return to the region next week in an effort to convince Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to live up to the peace accords reached in Dayton, Ohio, and bring about the ouster of two Bosnian Serb leaders, a senior Administration official said today.
The decision to send Mr. Holbrooke was reached on Friday at a White House meeting of President Clinton's senior national security advisers, after a recommendation by Secretary of State Warren Christopher, the official said. 
 Mr. Holbrooke will leave on Monday for Belgrade, and will also travel to Sarajevo and Zagreb, the Croatian capital. In recent weeks Mr. Holbrooke has been outspoken -- more so than the Administration -- on the need to fully carry out the Dayton accord and remove the Bosnian Serb leaders from power.
"Although there are serious issues in all three capitals, the primary issue is Milosevic," the official said. "We will read him the riot act and make clear that his behavior is inconsistent with the promises he made in Dayton."
In particular, Mr. Holbrooke will press Mr. Milosevic to fulfill his promises on insuring that the two Bosnian Serb leaders -- Radovan Karadzic, the political leader, and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the military commander -- are removed from power.
This week the International War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague issued arrest warrants for both men, who have been indicted on charges of war crimes.
Elections viewed as critical to Bosnia's future are scheduled for September, and the Western powers backing the Balkan peace accord want the Bosnian Serb leaders removed before the elections are held.
The thinking in asking Mr. Holbrooke to return to the region as an envoy is that he, more than any other figure in the Administration, has been able to wrest concessions from Mr. Milosevic. Despite Mr. Holbrooke's decision after the Bosnian peace agreement to leave public office, he has remained an official consultant.
Under the guidelines of the NATO mission in Bosnia, the NATO troops there do not have the responsibility to arrest General Mladic and Dr. Karadzic and turn them over to the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. In his discussions with Mr. Milosevic, Mr. Holbrooke will raise the issues of "both of removing them from power and facilitating their arrest," the official said.
At a meeting in London this week, the United States and the four other nations responsible for bringing peace to Bosnia -- Britain, France, Germany and Russia -- failed to reach agreement on whether to impose economic sanctions on Serbia because of President Milosevic's failure to live up to this aspect of the Dayton agreements.
The Clinton Administration has still not given Mr. Holbrooke specific instructions on whether the United States is prepared to move forward immediately with new sanctions against Serbia.
"The specific threat of sanctions has not yet been decided," the official said.
There was no discussion of a military response, the official said. The Pentagon, fearing reprisals against American troops, remains adamantly opposed to forcibly arresting the two Bosnian Serb leaders, particularly General Mladic, who commands the Bosnian Serb army and has a loyal following.

The Second Daley's Legacy

BYLINE: By BRENT STAPLES 

 BODY:
Downtown Chicago is an architectural dream, a place where bold skyscrapers stand mirrored in Lake Michigan and vivid against a vast Midwestern sky. But encircling this scene is a calamity of staggering dimensions -- the poorest and, until quite recently, worst-run public housing system in the United States.
The Chicago Housing Authority is landlord to about 100,000 people, 95 percent of whom live on welfare, in prison-like towers that depress property values and frighten away the middle class. Generations of black Chicagoans have grown up in the C.H.A., cut off from mainstream culture and opportunities. The city's legendary boss, Mayor Richard J. Daley, built much of modern Chicago, including many of its high-rise cages for the poor. There is a pleasing symmetry in the fact that his son, Mayor Richard M. Daley, is involved in a movement that could eventually eradicate them. 
 The opening chapter of the plan centers on the Cabrini Green housing project on Chicago's Near North Side, not far from the Gold Coast. If the funding plan solidifies and Cabrini tenants cooperate, the projects will be partly demolished and replaced with a mix of town houses, single-family houses, modest flats and mid-rise apartments. The development will be economically integrated -- 30 percent low-income, 20 percent subsidized moderate income and 50 percent market rate. Mr. Daley has committed 50 acres of city-owned real estate for private development to shore up the effort. In addition, the city will build schools, parks, a police station, a public library and other amenities. The Cabrini development should be the easiest to institute given its proximity to the rich. The challenge will come with hellish enclaves like Robert Taylor Homes, a deep-ghetto project in a neighborhood that was destroyed to build it.
The Daley initiative is remarkable given the city's history. As both the courts and urban historians have consistently pointed out, Chicago's public housing was deliberately used to segregate blacks who streamed into the city in the 1950's and 60's. Plans for public housing in white areas were killed by City Hall. The strategy left Chicago the most segregated of America's major cities, a place where demographers say blacks and whites are less likely than elsewhere to even encounter each other on the street.
In the late 1960's a group of tenants sued, charging what everybody knew -- that public housing was discriminatory. The case was named for Dorothy Gautreaux, who died before the case was finally decided. The city was ordered to make public housing available in white areas and was forbidden to build further in black areas, except on court approval. The Federal Government has earmarked about $40 million this year to institute the Gautreaux decision. Some of that money could end up in the Cabrini plan.
The three decades since the suit have seen public housing get steadily worse. Things began to look up only last year, when the Housing and Urban Development Secretary, Henry Cisneros, took control of the C.H.A., prompted by a management crisis and a series of crimes involving ever-younger children. The decision to hold the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this year obviously played a role as well. HUD installed Joseph Shuldiner, a former general manager of the New York City Housing Authority, as executive director.
His first-year results are promising. A quarter of the apartments have been placed under private management, improving services and letting administrators concentrate on deeper problems. Once a scandal, the voucher program for the poor who live outside the projects has been revamped and will produce a surplus this year. Evictions of disruptive tenants are up by a third, and unpaid rents down by a quarter. The C.H.A. has a balanced budget for the first time in memory, thanks in part to a tough new inspector general. Faced with tangible improvements, and honest management, tenants who feared redevelopment now embrace it.
Mayor Daley has been looking for a way to make his imprint on the city his father built. If he can transform public housing -- and sweep away those high-rise cages -- his legacy will be secure. BRENT STAPLES

HEADLINE: River Runs Wild and Town Finds Profit

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: COPPERHILL, Tenn., July 12

 BODY:
Who says you can't improve on Mother Nature?
Many in this town in the southern reaches of the Appalachians straddling the Tennessee-Georgia border are questioning that bit of conventional wisdom as they prepare for an influx of thousands of people this month for the whitewater kayaking and canoeing events of the 1996 Summer Olympics. 
 The course for the events, through a 1,700-foot stretch of twisting, churning water on the Ocoee (pronounced o-COE-ee) River, is the first Olympic whitewater course on a natural river. But it is natural only to a point. Over the last three years, engineers and designers have resculptured it, gingerly positioning boulders weighing up to six tons to narrow the river here or create eddies there, or carefully "enhancing" the rocky features of the river's bed usually left dry by diversion of the water to make power.
In the process, they have created a course that has drawn rave reviews from paddlers worldwide and has local residents contemplating a tourist-clogged future that could surpass the economic boom that accompanied the arrival here in the 1800's of the copper mining industry, long since defunct. And Olympic officials noted that tickets to the events at the site in the Cherokee National Forest two and a half hours north of Atlanta were among the first to sell out.
"There is nothing not to like about this course," said Joe Jacobi, one-half of the United States team that won the gold medal in the two-man whitewater canoe event in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992 and who last year moved from the Washington area to Copperhill to be near the Ocoee. "I'm the only paddler who can truthfully say that I have the best whitewater route in the world in my backyard."
The signs of change are all around the tiny mountain town of 362. But those signs are often at war. Along the main street, two new coffee shops -- Loving Chocolates and Small Planet -- demurely advertise cappuccinos and lattes. Just a few doors away at the Nugget, the town's not-so-new pool hall/tattoo parlor/bar, "Tattoos" blares out in five-foot letters over the door.
"It's getting yuppified, and they are trying to run me out," complained Paul Blair, the Nugget's owner, as he described what he termed repeated harassment by city officials.
Whitewater kayaking and canoeing crashed into the region quite by accident. The Tennessee Valley Authority had harnessed most of the 40-mile-long Ocoee as it runs from Georgia, where it is called the Toccoa, into Tennessee, for hydroelectric power. The agency dammed it into reservoirs and or diverted through tunnels or along miles of wooden flumes that allowed the water to plunge hundreds of feet and turn turbines. One day in the early 80's, a truss holding one flume broke, and the Ocoee returned to its natural course for a few miles.
Ferris Maloof, a Copperhill businessman, recalled that the accident reproduced "a beautiful, wild whitewater river" that quickly spawned a thriving commercial rafting industry. When the T.V.A. had repaired its flume and sought to resume its power generation on that section of the river, the new and growing industry fought them. Eventually a lease and permit system was established, allowing flows on designated sections of the river 116 days a year. The flows support a $40 million annual industry that last year attracted nearly 300,000 people to the area.
"It was a godsend," Mr. Maloof said of the collapse of the flume, noting that it paved the way for the area's being considered as the site of the Olympic whitewater events and the creation of the new course.
The $25 million refashioning of the river began three years ago as a joint effort by the T.V.A., the United States Forest Service and the Tennessee Ocoee Development Authority. As a first step, Mark Mobley, a T.V.A. engineer, and John Anderson, an architect-designer, built a 300-foot-long scale model of a stretch of the river. With the aid of computer modeling, sprayed concrete and wire, they duplicated at one-tenth scale every rock shelf, depression and hydraulic jump, where some of the water turns back on itself. Then they manipulated the flow with sandbags and modeling clay.
Meira Crawford, a spokeswoman for the Forest Service, said that in altering the river's banks with native limestone boulders, all individually positioned and cemented with sand-toned, pebble-flecked concrete, the agency sought a natural a look and a route over which the river could easily wash when swollen by rains.
Mr. Mobley said that in remodeling the river he and Mr. Anderson had encountered large boulders in the once-dry riverbed spray-painted with graffiti. After sandblasting the rocks clean, they decided to preserve the essence of the graffiti in some names for the course's features. Thus, a point where the current sluices between two boulders near the start is called Smiley Face for the picture on one of the now-submerged rocks.
Scott Shipley, a 25-year-old member of the United States team who is the 1995 world champion in the one-man kayak event, said recently after a practice run that the course had features that were minefields for paddlers. One is a "hole" called "Humongous" where the foamy clash of rushing water can hold a kayaker in place interminably. Last September in the world championships on the course, he saw a Swedish kayaker become so tired as she vainly tried to paddle out of the swirl that she eventually jumped from her boat and swam to the bank.
It is such dramatic features, said Reed Sisson, a spokesman for the state development agency that will operate the course after the Olympics, that make residents think the location will attract future events and more tourists. And unlike the copper mines whose shafts made Swiss cheese out of the mountains, the whitewater industry creates few environmental concerns.
Until about two years ago, unemployment had been as high as 15 percent, Mr. Sisson said, and residents had been leaving since the last copper mine closed in 1985. But with the whitewater phenomenon, unemployment is now about 4 percent.

Long Beach Rent Battle Focuses on Vacancy Rate

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
A DISPUTE between landlords and the City of Long Beach over the continuation of rent stabilization there could, according to lawyers representing both sides, lead to new guidelines for all municipalities that have adopted the Emergency Tenants Protection Act of 1974.
Lawyers say that the state statute never laid down clear rules on how municipalities determine whether a rent emergency continues to exist and that the Long Beach controversy could clarify some of the issues. 
 The Emergency Tenants Protection Act applies only to Rockland, Westchester and Nassau Counties. Like the separate rent control and rent stabilization laws applying to New York City, it expires next June, when the State Legislature must decide whether to renew or amend it.
The state law gives municipalities the option to adopt rent protections if a survey reveals that vacancies in rental buildings are 5 percent or less.
However, should vacancies subsequently exceed that threshold, rent stabilization must be lifted, the law says. But it does not specifically require periodic vacancy studies. Also, the Emergency Tenants Protection Act applies only to buildings completed before Jan. 1, 1974.
In Nassau, 24 municipalities, including Long Beach, have adopted rent stabilization. Long Beach initially included only buildings of 100 units or more, but added those with 60 to 99 units in 1979. Twenty-two buildings with 1,553 apartments are now rent stabilized.
In the current dispute, four essentially identical lawsuits were filed in May by landlords and others against the city and the City Council.
They claim in part that a rent emergency no longer exists in Long Beach because the vacancy rate now exceeds 5 percent.
Two of the actions were brought in State Supreme Court in Mineola and two in United States District Court in Brooklyn because constitutional issues have been raised.
Several condominium owners and homeowners and a co-op corporation have joined with the landlords. The additional plaintiffs are collectively seeking $4.5 million in damages from the city on the claim that their property values have declined because they must pay higher taxes to make up for the reduced taxes paid by apartment house owners. Landlords are seeking $24.2 million in damages.
But lawyers on both sides agree that the main issue before the courts is whether the city is illegally maintaining rent stabilization if, as landlords contend, vacancies now exceed 5 percent.
"This case is about the 5 percent," said Herbert Rubin, a Manhattan lawyer who represents the landlords' group. "Seventeen years have gone by and the city has done nothing to ascertain whether 5 percent vacancies still exist or don't exist." In New York City, a vacancy study is undertaken periodically. It has always found the vacancy rate to be under 5 percent.
Martin A. Shlufman, a Garden City lawyer who also represents the plaintiffs, said a survey done by landlords late last year found at least 90 vacant apartments in rent-stabilized buildings -- establishing that more than 5 percent of apartments were vacant, he said.
ALL 22 buildings were not surveyed, Mr. Shlufman said, "because all we had to do was come up with a figure in excess of 5 percent," or 78 apartments.
But tenant groups contend that landlords have been warehousing apartments to inflate vacancy figures. Landlords say that is not the case. In January, the owners formally requested that the city conduct its own survey.
Before that can be done, several key issues on which the law is "silent," have to be resolved, said Joel K. Asarch, corporation counsel for Long Beach. "As far as I'm concerned, a silent statute doesn't put a duty on somebody," he said.
For example, is a municipality obligated to do a survey just because a landlord requests one?
Must all vacant apartments -- even those not on the rental market -- be counted? The law does not address the warehousing issue, he said.
And which buildings are included? Some courts have held that subsidized rental housing that is owned and managed by a local housing authority must be counted even though such buildings are not subject to rent stabilization.
In Long Beach, that would add 288 units of fully occupied subsidized housing for the elderly.
Conversely, 25 West Broadway, a rent-stabilized building, is undergoing a major renovation in which 66 of 89 apartments are empty and will shortly go on the rental market. Should the building, which still lacks a certificate of occupancy though it has existing tenants, be counted?
"From a legal point of view, there are a lot of points that these cases are going to raise," Mr. Asarch said. "We need the court's guiding hand so that we can do the proper thing."
Rent stabilization has always been a simmering issue in Long Beach. In 1974, landlords challenged the city's adoption of the rent law, but lost. Later, however, they won large tax reductions on the claim that rent stabilization reduced their buildings' market value.
Landlords say that rent increases allowed by the Nassau Rent Guidelines Board are not enough to cover the cost of operating and maintaining their buildings, especially in an oceanfront community where the weather is particularly damaging.
Last year, the guidelines board approved a 1.5 percent increase for a one-year lease and a 2.5 percent increase for a two-year lease. Increases for the current year have not yet been decided. Landlords also say that when they make major capital improvements it takes years to recoup their investment.
"I am in an economic war pure and simple, and I am going to do everything I can to defend myself," said Samuel Walton, a Melville developer who is a lead plaintiff in two of the four lawsuits. His 276-unit Executive Towers at Lido on East Broadway is one of the major rent-stabilized buildings in Long Beach.
BUT tenants maintain that Long Beach is such a desirable place to live that rents would skyrocket without protections. They also assert that even with stabilization, rents are continuously rising.
"When I moved here 20 years ago, I paid $300 a month, and now I'm paying almost $800," said Shirley Weber, who occupies a one-bedroom apartment at the Executive Towers complex.
Units similar to hers where there has been greater turnover are renting for $1,100 a month or more, she said.
Edwin L. Eaton, the City Manager of Long Beach, said that concerns that vacancies might have crept over 5 percent prompted the city to suggest a compromise earlier this year: vacancy decontrol, under which existing tenants continue to receive rent protection but apartments that become vacant are removed from rent stabilization.
"Given our fears, we felt it was a good compromise because it allowed us to protect people and also give landlords a little bit of what they were looking for," Mr. Eaton said.
Landlords were satisfied, but tenants so vigorously opposed the idea at a public hearing held April 16 that the City Council decided to table all further discussion indefinitely. The first two lawsuits were brought by the landlords' group on May 19.
Mrs. Weber said she and fellow tenants opposed vacancy decontrol because they were fearful it would open the door for harassment to get them out.
"These are rental units, but they are our homes," Mrs. Weber said. "It's a terrifying thing to feel your home is in jeopardy."
Vacancy decontrol also destroys a community, said Michael McKee, director of development for the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, a tenants' advocacy group. He has been counseling tenants in Long Beach.
"No one who could not afford to pay a market rent could ever again move to Long Beach, and middle-income people would be squeezed out," he said.
Now that landlords "have thrown down the gauntlet," said Mr. Asarch, the city's Corporation Counsel, "we intend to fight tooth and nail to protect the citizens of this town."
"All eyes will be on Long Beach," said Mr. Shlufman, the landlords' lawyer. "This is the kind of case that probably will make new law, because the courts will now have to interpret the statute and what it intended and what it required."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 21, 1996, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article in some copies last Sunday about a legal challenge to rent control in Long Beach, L.I., included a quotation from a tenant, Shirley Weber, misstating her rent. Figures supplied by her landlord, Samuel Walton, and now confirmed by Mrs. Weber show that her 1976 apartment rent was $340 a month, not $300; her present rent is $741, not "almost $800." The current figure, however, includes an $80 garage charge; the apartment is $661.

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
CHARLES INGENITO and Regina Hrostek, who are getting married in September, set their sights on living in North Jersey to be near their jobs and families. He is a lawyer in Bergen County; she is a saleswoman for a Stamford, Conn., information technology consulting concern.
After searching the area's housing market the couple found that, for what they would pay to rent an apartment, they would be better served buying a home and building equity. But single-family detached homes were too expensive or needed too much work, Mr. Ingenito said. They settled on a town house at Franklin Heights, a 420-unit community being built in Mahwah in Bergen County. It cost less than $200,000, their price range. 
 Steven Schwartz and Susan Robolino, who plan to marry next year, tell a similar story. The couple, who work for a Morris County incentive concern -- he as director of computer operations, she as a meeting planner -- are buying a new condominium duplex apartment in the 140-unit Cambridge Heights at Clifton complex. The price was less than $140,000.
Both couples are helping to once again fuel the market for attached housing, as are single men and women, empty-nester couples and some young families. That market was overbuilt in the mid-80's construction surge and came to a near-halt during the recession, when buyers were worried about declining prices and their ability to resell units.
Since then, as the state's residential market has slowly improved, helped by reasonable mortgage rates, so has attached housing. Much of the oversupply of such homes has been absorbed and prices, though lower, have stabilized, said David J. Schoner, vice president of the new homes division at the Coldwell Banker brokerage.
"I don't think we can sell in five years and make a huge profit, but we can make a little," Mr. Ingenito said, adding that he and his fiancee also liked the lifestyle town houses offered.
Ms. Robolino and Mr. Schwartz were also worried about resale value. "But we bought at a lower preconstruction price and feel we can at least make back what we pay for the unit," she said, adding the key for them was that it was new and affordable.
Builders are hoping other buyers who cannot or choose not to buy a one-family detached home will also view attached housing at less than $200,000 as a viable alternative. Some 100 such new and existing projects, with 16,000 units, are under way in the state's 14 north and central counties, according to Coldwell Banker. Some projects also mix in single-family homes on small lots.
"Attached housing has come back," said Robert Burchell, a professor at the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. "But it has a limited window of opportunity." To draw buyers, he added, the units must be well located, sell for one-third to one-half less than the price of new detached homes in the area and give buyers newer features than they would get in older single-family resales.
Builders are adding features not found in attached houses at these prices built in the 1980's. Among them are basements and garages. They are also larger.
OTHERWISE, they are in direct competition with one-family detached resales, Dr. Burchell said, adding that "the single-family home still predominates the market."
But producing attached housing people can afford, many developers said, is becoming more difficult because of the growing scarcity of available land for multifamily housing.
Indeed, developers with current projects have been able to respond to demand because many have taken over already zoned sites or projects with all their approvals in place. One is K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank. "Towns have shut the door on attached housing," said Merle Huseth, president of its northeast region. "But it is still desirable." He said people who bought condominiums or co-ops years ago now wanted to "move up to something affordable, and affordable becomes attached housing in densely populated areas."
Two of the company's projects illustrate the point. At Franklin Heights off Franklin Turnpike in Mahwah, sales began nine months ago. Of the 420 condominium apartments and town houses planned, including 81 income-restricted Mount Laurel units, 197 have been built and all but 18 sold. In that time, prices have risen by $2,000 to $4,000, with the two-bedroom, 1,236-square-foot condominiums now selling for $143,950. Two- and three-bedroom town houses, with 1,338 to 1,662 square feet, cost $156,950 to $169,950. Basements are included, but garages are not, Mr. Huseth said.
Off Route 22 in Bridgewater in Somerset County, Hovnanian is building Stratton Meadows, a 487-unit development, including 97 Mount Laurel units. It will have 120 condominiums of 1,250 to 1,600 square feet each and 259 town houses 1,500 to 2,000 square feet with garages. There will also be 108 single-family homes of 1,800 to 2,900 square feet on small lots. Prices are $120,000 to $185,000 for the attached units and $196,000 to $240,000 for the single-family homes. In the six months since sales began, 148 homes have been sold, Mr. Huseth said.
Just off Chimney Rock Road in the Martinsville section of Bridgewater, work is under way on Loft Farm, with 148 town houses, 17 of them for low- and moderate-income buyers. Prices for the units, with 1,600 to 2,400 square feet of space plus garages and basements, are to start at $179,000. "This is affordable for the area and people will buy if they perceive value," said Jeffrey Freireich, a principal of Westminster Homes Inc., an affiliate of the Kushner Companies, both of Florham Park, which is developing the project. Sales are to start this summer.
Pricing along with location is drawing buyers to Cambridge Heights at Clifton, said Joseph L. DiBernardo, senior vice president at Whiteweld, Barrister & Brown. The Manhattan-based real estate concern is developing the gated condominium community under its residential arm, Town and Country Developers in Woodcliff Lake.
The company bought the 9.5-acre site on Myron Street two years ago with an approved site plan. It is adjacent to a neighborhood park and close to shopping and an N.J. Transit train station with direct service to Manhattan.
"The area's large population of tenants created a demand for this product, as did empty-nesters who want to sell their single-family house and put their equity into a condominium for the convenience and to stay in the area," said Jack Vaughan, vice president of marketing for Town and Country.
THE two-bedroom apartments will have 1,007 to 1,600 square feet as well as 40- to 55-square-foot decks. The larger units have lofts. Prices, which have risen $14,000 to $27,000 since sales opened in March, are now $127,900 to $154,900. Deposits have been taken on 73 units, Mr. DiBernardo said.
A revived town house project in the Toms River section of Dover Township in Ocean County, called Saratoga at Toms River, is also attracting buyers. The developer is the Menk Corporation, part of H. Hovnanian Industries of Tinton Falls, whose head is Hirair Hovnanian, brother of Kevork Hovnanian, chief executive of K. Hovnanian Enterprises. Menk took over the development two years ago after 144 of the original 400 units were built and sold.
The company has reduced the remaining units to 232 "to make them larger and add one-car garages," said Vram Yegparian, president of Menk. The units, which also offer optional basements, have 1,650 to 2,050 square feet of space and are priced from $101,990 to $122,000, Mr. Yegparian said, noting that one-third of the units had been sold. "The market," he added, "is telling us there is need for this type of housing."

You Work at Home. Does the Town Board Care?

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: MADISON, Conn.

 BODY:
WHEN many government officials peek behind bedroom doors, institute "don't ask, don't tell" policies or ask people to "come out of the closet," they are not prying into residents' sex lives -- they are just trying to exercise some control over the booming growth of home offices.
With downsizing at American corporations coinciding with the advent of easy-to-use, relatively cheap telecommunications equipment, more and more professional workers are trying out entrepreneurial skills by setting up offices in spare bedrooms and basements. 
 Hardly a suburban neighborhood is without a marketing consultant or a graphic designer working full time at home or a corporate manager who telecommutes a few days a week.
As many as 40 million people work at least part time at home, with about 8,000 home-based businesses starting daily, according to IDC/Link of New York, an electronics information research group. Of those, some 1.5 million claimed deductions averaging $2,000 each for home offices on their tax returns for 1993, the last year available, according to the Internal Revenue Service.
For local officials, then, the question is whether to ignore all this or to enforce zoning or tax regulations that place home-based businesses in technical violation of the law.
Many communities see no threat to their residential nature as long as home businesses stay out of sight; they are content with a "don't ask, don't tell" strategy that places a fig leaf of ignorance on a potential enforcement problem.
Others, like this suburb on the Connecticut shoreline, gently nudge those with home offices to declare themselves and submit to regulation. Still others, though, are cracking down tightly, fearing that today's low-impact business could turn into tomorrow's neighborhood nuisance.
And many towns are struggling to rewrite ordinances to recognize the changing ways in which Americans work, to blend inoffensive home offices into the community and to clarify the line between home and business.
As communities debate the issues, many people with home offices play a cat-and-mouse game with neighbors and local officials, minimizing the outward signs of commerce -- the visiting clients, the nonresident employees, the delivery trucks -- that draw attention.
The virtual cop on the home-office beat is a neighbor who takes umbrage, justified or not, at any hint of illegality.
In Connecticut, an executive working out of her home with no visiting customers, signs or noise was hauled before her condominium board in the last year to answer complaints by a neighbor that she was violating local regulations. Earlier, a St. Louis minister's wife who gave children piano lessons faced a fine and a possible jail sentence because people objected to "clients" coming into her home; the authorities relented but her home association took action against her anyway.
Sharon Kersten, a Miami Beach resident who is trying to get the city to legalize home-based businesses like her public relations operation, said, "I have a next-door neighbor who would turn me in in a heartbeat" if she knew about the home office.
"Commercial real estate interests are real strong here, and they are afraid of losing business because people find it cheaper to work at home," said Ms. Kersten, 44, who is married and has a 14-year-old stepdaughter. "I am going public because I feel it is a family-values issue -- parents can work at home and be with their children."
Others with home offices are organizing on local, state and national levels to lobby for protection and swap information on everything from tax strategies to handling the loneliness of the cloistered office.
"Many existing residential zoning laws prohibit home offices for anyone other than licensed professionals like doctors, lawyers and architects," said Ron Wohl, a director of the American Home-Based Business Association, a Maryland group that is trying to expand its national membership of 1,000. When most laws were written, he noted, the personal computer and the virtual office were barely a dream. The old laws, he said, were intended to block businesses, like bustling sales offices or noisy repair shops, that were incompatible with residential neighborhoods.
"The result," he said, "is people are forced to operate outside the law, and so an economy producing billions of dollars has been driven underground."
The easing of zoning rules to allow broader uses -- as long as a home remains primarily a residence -- has liberated many thousands of entrepreneurs who had lurked in the gray areas of legitimacy.
Suburban officials, recognizing that the growing cadres of home-based workers can benefit local bankers and merchants more than those who go to an office in another town, are more accommodating than cities faced with expensive office space sitting empty, said Abhijeet Rane, an analyst at IDC/Link.
Moreover, he said, working at home solves child-care problems for two-paycheck couples and helps reduce break-ins in what had been bedroom communities that emptied during the day.
"The question of how much and what type of work can reasonably be done at home is going to be a big issue for the next 10 years," Mr. Rane predicted. "There are too many social benefits and too much support from big businesses who will reap the benefits of telecommuting."
A SURVEY conducted by Home Office Computing magazine found that some cities were at the forefront in providing a friendly climate for home-based businesses. Phoenix ranked first in the survey, which was based on factors like public and private efforts to assist the home-office worker.
Second on the list was Gaithersburg, Md., in Montgomery County in suburban Washington. The county passed a zoning law six years ago that opened residences to a range of occupations if conditions were met. That ordinance and subsequent ones in other communities generally set limits for nonresident employees, visiting clients, inventory and storage facilities, parking, outdoor signs and the amount of interior space devoted to work. Businesses that generate traffic, noise, odors and visual pollution remained outlawed.
Running a business from an apartment depends on the tolerance levels of nosy or cranky neighbors, Mr. Wohl pointed out, and condominiums and property owners' associations with bylaws that supersede local zoning regulations can be hostile to anything but pure residential use.
Mr. Wohl, a management consultant, and his wife, Myrna, who runs a sign-language service, run separate businesses out of their house in the Montgomery County community of North Potomac and, he said, have yet to hear a neighbor complain.
"We have two personal computers, three modems, two faxes, 14 phone lines, cellular phones and beepers, and no one driving by would ever know anything was going on inside," he said. "By contrast, the most hideous example of a professional business going haywire in Montgomery County was a husband-and-wife team of psychiatrists in North Chevy Chase who ran a 24-hour group therapy practice in a neighborhood of Victorian homes. They paved every inch of grass in their yard for parking and installed huge lights to illuminate the entire property before the neighbors knew what was happening."
Carol J. Newton has no comparable surprises for her neighbors in Madison, a community of 16,000 on Long Island Sound, about 15 miles east of New Haven.
A former marketing communications specialist and kindergarten teacher, Ms. Newton, who is 38, has run a part-time interior-design business since 1989 from her two-story frame house with an outdoor pool on a wooded lot.
Madison has a fairly liberal zoning law that permits unobtrusive businesses like hers. But the town also has a one-time $25 fee for a "customary home occupation" permit for home offices and, more important, Connecticut has a personal property tax on business equipment and materials that is levied at the same rate as the property tax.
MS. NEWTON, whose husband, Hunt, runs telecommuting training seminars for the Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation, said she figured she had little to lose when she received a permit last year, because most of her work was done on a telephone. "My office had a board for a desk, two file cabinets and swatches of materials," she said.
Her extra annual tax is $20.
But others with more expensive furnishings and sophisticated equipment are reluctant to declare themselves to the tax collector. Only 314 home-occupation permits have been issued in the last 20 years, and many of those have expired, town officials reported, while no one knows for sure how many residents work in home offices. Unlike surrounding communities, Madison, where the average house costs $240,000, has no malls or extensive shopping areas. Office space is restricted to the Boston Post Road and a few smaller strips.
Yet there are at least 1,078 concerns doing business in Madison, many or perhaps most of them home-based, according to Margaret M. Sprague, owner of a printing company here, called 2 Ems. She keeps a data base of local business ventures.
Ms. Sprague acknowledges that she is a beneficiary of this boom. She started a desktop publishing business on her dining-room table in 1980, moved it to her basement when she needed more room and leased downtown office space when she hired assistants. She now has two full-time and two part-time assistants, including her husband, Kent, who lost his job in industrial chemical sales when his company shrank.
"My own business flourished because people who were being downsized out of jobs were starting their own businesses at home and needed strong office support," she said. "It opened business to me that didn't exist before. Storefronts in Madison that were vacant are now filling up, and I have to believe it's because there are a lot more people around who used to spend their days in New Haven or New York."
On a recent day, she said, she received printing orders from three new clients, all new home-based operators: a manufacturer's representative, a medical communications specialist and a graphic designer.
TOM RYLANDER, first selectman of Madison, said that the businesses whose operations were visible to outsiders were complying with the permit requirements and that tax laws and enforcement were not a problem. "Those not visible can probably skirt it if they wish," he said.
Mary Haburay, a zoning official in Madison, said those with home offices complied with the law only when a neighbor complained. "We're not out there looking for them," she said. "We have a lot more pressing things to do."
That is not the attitude of Pat Hedwall, the town tax assessor. "Frankly," she said, "many residents with offices in their homes either don't know they're supposed to file a personal property tax declaration every year or somehow 'forget' to do it and hope we'll never find them."
Ms. Hedwall said tight town budgets had made it her duty to be vigilant about these businesses.
"By state law if I find them I can audit their books for three years," she said with the feigned fervor of a suburban Inspector Javert. "But frankly, the way most of them keep books they're not worth much. And it costs me $200 to run an audit, so it may not be practical."
Still, she said, she scours the local newspaper and telephone books for clues to residential businesses and often uncovers clandestine home offices while conducting routine property assessments.
"A guy the other day got a building permit for a garage with a room over it he called living space. I took a look at it and said, 'Wait a minute, that's obviously intended for business.'
"I told him to fill out the tax forms or else have me guess what the value is. And I have a very creative imagination."
At the local tax rate, she said, $8,000 worth of home equipment would translate into a yearly tax bill of $124.32, not much for a thriving business but a thorn to one on a shoestring.
In wealthy Greenwich, closer to New York, the pace of telecommuting and home-office operations has been torrid for several years, said Bruce Dixon, the assistant zoning enforcement officer.
"We issued 1,100 building permits last year," he said, "and more than half of them, I'd say, involve additions or alterations for home offices."
Last year, Ms. Newton and a friend, Michelle Murphy, started a Connecticut chapter of the American Home-Based Business Association, which has since spawned three local chapters.
"There's an absence of support services for people doing what we're doing, namely running a business and caring for a family under one roof," said Ms. Murphy, a freelance writer and mother of three. "Issues like isolation in the home and assistance with technical services are very much in the forefront of our lives. Networking helps take some of the stress out of it for people used to working in offices with support systems you took for granted."
Now when her fax machine jams, she said, "instead of tearing my hair out and calling an '800' service number, I call one of our chapter members."
She is also more relaxed about letting clients know she works from home instead of a fancy office somewhere.
"In the beginning when I was on the phone with someone and the babies started crying and whining, I raced from room to room with the portable phone one step ahead of them to keep the other party from hearing," she said.
"Now that other party is just as likely to be working from home, so it's no big deal."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Market Dip Sparks Recession Talk

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The only thing we have to fear is everything.
That could be the message of the stock market in July 1996. First it got scared that the economy was too strong. Then it grew very fearful that the economy was too weak. 
 As it happens, this is a market that has gone a long time without being afraid of much of anything. The mutual fund portfolio managers have acted as if the biggest fear they had was of not being able to get money invested fast enough. And the individuals who funded the mutual funds seemed to be afraid only that they might miss out on a huge bull market.
Is this merely another example of how Wall Street psychology can turn on a dime? Is it more proof that professional traders tend to be manic-depressives? Or is it a signal that something fundamental has changed?
Perhaps it is the latter. While much of Wall Street has been focusing on the Federal Reserve, as if Alan Greenspan controlled the world, the real power has been held by millions of individual Americans. Since 1990, and particularly since the end of 1994, mutual fund investors have taken every sign of worry on Wall Street as a buying opportunity. Money poured in, usually the next day, and prices soon were rising again.
That comfortable pattern is not working now. Monday, which should have seen an influx of cash after the 114-point debacle on July 6, in fact was a poor day. There was a bit of a rally on Tuesday, but it was downhill from there. After Thursday's selloff, there were repeated attempts at a rally on Friday, but they failed.
Still, the Dow is down just 4.6 percent from the peak of 5,778 it reached in May. Not since 1994 has there been a 5 percent retreat, based on closing figures. The index has traded below that drop, as it did on both Thursday and Friday, but it has always rallied. Birinyi Associates, a research firm, says the Dow has never gone so long without such a setback.
The market is acting, for the first time in quite a while, as though it thinks a recession is possible. Cyclical stocks have come under some of the heaviest pressure in the current downturn.
Chuck Clough, the Merrill Lynch strategist, thinks the market is right. He sees signs that corporate profits are beginning to weaken, that the capital spending boom is over and that the extraordinary level of retail buying of early this year is fading. "There could be a recession by the end of 1996," Mr. Clough said on Friday. "If we're not in a statistical recession, we'll be in a profits recession for at least several quarters."
That is distinctly a minority view. Most of the seers think profits will do quite decently, thank you. "The equity market will do well if bonds do well," argues Abby Joseph Cohen, the Goldman, Sachs strategist. "The economy will decelerate, but earnings will still grow." And she thinks that as people gain confidence, they will begin to pay for stocks based on estimates of 1997 profits.
At the moment, you have to squint to see evidence that the economy is seriously slowing. The worry last week was set off when Motorola and Hewlett-Packard, two technology companies, said profits were disappointing. But technology companies are not reliable economic indicators, coming from an industry that, for the last couple of years, has been exceedingly strong. Had the whole economy grown like technology, we would be in a boom the likes of which have never been seen. It's about time for some weakness there. A lot more evidence is needed.
Still, the last two weeks have seen the Nasdaq composite lose 6.9 percent of its value, leaving it 11.7 percent below the peak it set last month. That is getting close to the worst correction of the last three years, the 13.7 percent dip that occurred in 1994.
One essential point for investors is that the Fed doesn't know a lot more than the rest of us, and therefore is unlikely to provide the needed clues. The excessive attention given the Fed reached a peak last week, when reporters seized on a report by a couple of Fed staffers that had previously, and deservedly, been quite obscure. That report, called "The Opportunistic Approach to Disinflation," might indicate the Fed won't tighten. Or maybe it doesn't.
The study basically suggests that the Fed might choose to fight inflation not by trying to choke off growth that gets too rapid but by simply waiting for the inevitable recession to cut inflation and then trying to keep it from rising again. Its relevance to immediate policy is probably minimal.
So don't watch the Fed. Watch your neighbors, and see if they are losing faith in this generation's great belief, that stocks are now, as always, the best long-term investment. That belief has been enough to make historic valuation rules meaningless.
Eventually, valuation will count. And that is why there is a lot to be said for bonds at current levels, which provide a guaranteed return that the stock market may have trouble matching. But signs of a revival of interest in bonds are few. Fear aside, stocks are still popular.
There is one new indicator that will encourage the bears. The Nasdaq stock market has a new president, Albert Berkeley. The last time it got a new leader was a few weeks before the 1987 crash. And Mr. Berkeley took over a couple of days before the latest peak in the Nasdaq composite.
That has not gone unnoticed, Mr. Berkeley says: "My brother calls me 'Top Tick.' "

HEADLINE: NEIGBORHOOD REPORT: LOWER MANHATTAN;
At Twin Towers, the Ice Rink Goeth

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
It opened to great fanfare in January: an ice-skating rink between the twin towers of the World Trade Center, heralded as a boon that would attract tourists and new residents alike to lower Manhattan as the neighborhood seeks to recover from the recession that sapped its real-estate market.
 Now, less than six months later, the rink, Recreation World Ice Chalet, is padlocked. And in one of the biggest skating squabbles since Tonya Harding versus Nancy Kerrigan, a court battle has erupted between the rink's operator, Recreation World, and the Trade Center owner, the Port Authority. 

 The Port Authority said it is seeking to end the rink's lease because it was badly run. Recreation World, which had run Wollman and Lasker rinks in Central Park, responded with a lawsuit accusing the authority of failing to live up to its part of the deal. As the two sides argue, the rink, which was supposed to be resurfaced for use by in-line skaters this summer, lies fallow.
 "Unfortunately the rink failed to live up to our expectations," said a Port Authority spokesman, Allen Morrison. "It did not meet expected revenue goals. And the rink is unsightly. It doesn't add to the esthetics of the plaza."
 Recreation World countered that the Port Authority violated the lease by failing to spend $45,000 marketing the rink and by trying to force it to close without due notice. The company is suing for $8 million in damages and the right to continue operating the rink.
 The rink's closing comes as civic groups have stepped up efforts to make downtown Manhattan a recreation destination as well as a residential neighborhood. The city offers tax breaks to developers who convert office buildings into apartment houses; the J.M. Kaplan Fund created Heritage Trails, historical markers to guide tourists on walking tours, and the Alliance for Downtown New York, the local business improvement district, sponsors a free shuttle bus for shoppers and many outdoor events.
 "The rink was a good, creative idea," said Mike O'Connor, the alliance's vice president of operations. "It was a first try. Things don't always work on the first try. I went once at lunchtime. I found it invigorating. But it wasn't crowded."
 A 1993 report by the Department of City Planning found that "the five acres of the World Trade Center's plaza have never achieved their potential to be a major open space resource for Lower Manhattan." It notes that the plaza is uncomfortably windy, cut off from the concourse below and isolated from nearby streets. So the Port Authority, which has commissioned a study analyzing the possibility of selling the Trade Center or privatizing its management, decided to spruce up the plaza. The rink was one step. Another will be the opening of a large Borders Bookstore later this summer.
 What worked so well in the plaza below Rockefeller Center, which opened its rink on Christmas Day 1936, quickly fell apart at the Trade Center. But the Port Authority may try again. "The concept was good," Mr. Morrison said, "but the implementation was not what we expected." MICHAEL COOPER

HEADLINE: Legislator, 72, Defies the Odds

BYLINE: By JOHN RANDAZZO

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
THEY call him the Iron Man of politics and "the people's choice" as he campaigns in a wheelchair for an unprecedented 14th term on the County Board of Legislators.
 The sobriquets fit well on Legislator Andrew Albanese, 72, an Eastchester Republican and middle-of-the-road populist who is recovering from a stroke he suffered two years ago, and he is still on the job. 

 The first thing he did the other day after laboriously rising from his wheelchair and firmly gripping a four-pronged cane in his office was to call a constituent whose mother was a stroke patient.
 "Hi'ya," Mr. Albanese said, with his wife, Linda, at his side in the County Office Building here. "Before your mother can enter the rehabilitation center, we must fill out proper papers."
 Then, Mrs. Albanese, who chauffeurs her husband around in a van, wheeled him to a committee meeting a few doors down the hall with Legislator George Latimore of Rye, the minority chairman, and other lawmakers.
 "Andy has personal friends and relationships on both sides, politics notwithstanding," Mr. Latimore said. "He's straightforward, a man in tune with the people."
 But few Democrats on the 17-member Board, and those not on it, seem to share these sentiments. Soon after Mr. Albanese announced for a 14th term last year opposition started.
 Republicans hold a majority of 11 to 6 on the Board. The Democratic leadership would like Mr. Albanese to retire to a home the couple has built in Arizona.
 Critics contend that Mr. Albanese, a well-known restaurateur in Eastchester, is not physically able to represent his 10th District constituency in Eastchester, Tuckahoe, Bronxville and parts of Mount Vernon and New Rochelle. Since late 1983, Democrats had failed to field a candidate to wrest control of the district.
 His attendance at Board and committee meetings, they say, is poor, claiming that he often arrives late or not at all, which Mr. Albanese vigorously denies.
 "President Roosevelt used a wheelchair, too," Mr. Albanese said. "And the other day a person in a wheelchair took part in the Olympic parade in Mamaroneck."
 But Mr. Albanese is no F.D.F., his detractors contend.
 "You've got to admit his 26 years on the Board constitute a superb career for social legislation he initiated and helped pass," said Legislator Thomas J. Abinanti, a Democrat of Greenburgh.
 "There's a paradox there though," Mr. Abinanti continued. "By staying in power so long, he has blocked the input of new blood new ideas." Patricia Fitzgerald Gorski, clerk of the County Board of Legislators, calls Mr. Albanese "an icon of the people regardless of party affiliation." She started on the Board as a secretary 25 years ago.
 Mr. Albanese, one of 10 children of Italian immigrants, and his brother, John, a former Town Councilman who died in 1991, represent almost a half-century of uninterrupted public service in Westchester. John Albanese was also President Roosevelt's bodyguard as a state trooper in the early 1940's.
 The Albaneses' three sons, Raymond, John and Gregory, who have five children among them, have taken part in local entry-level politics.
 There are some indications Mr. Albanese may be having second thoughts about another term.
 "I'm not buckling to pressure. I feel fine, but it's up to my doctor," he said.
 Mrs. Albanese said of her husband, "It's really up to him."
 One of his biggest boosters is County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke. "Andy is a people-oriented, moderate Republican, an iron man really," he said. "I would be glad to fly with him anywhere." That's a private joke between them: recently they flew a B-17 from Westchester Airport to survey land for a project they are working on.
 Together, they lead a drive to cut taxes and expenditures. "Downsizing has resulted in a 20 percent drop in the county work force," said Mr. Albanese, who has pioneered other economies.
 "Our senior citizens," he said, "can't afford high property taxes and are moving out in droves, while young people can't move in for the same reasons."
 Mr. Albanese, citing his achievements, said he had initiated legislation to identify sex offenders in communities; voted for the police in Westchester to carry 9-millimeter guns; endorsed drug and alcohol rehabilitation; was in favor of more safety at ATM locations, and approved of additional gun control mandates.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: John B. Larson;
Universal Internet Access, Fall of '96

BYLINE: By ANDREA ZIMMERMANN

 BODY:
ON Sept. 28, community volunteers are to start wiring Connecticut's schools and libraries, providing access to and home pages on the Internet. The initiative is called ConneCT96 and is being led by John B. Larson, a former gubernatorial candidate, past president of the state Senate and a former elementary and high school teacher.
 Mr. Larson, currently a senior fellow at the Yale University Bush Center for Child Development and Social Policy, said that any school or library that, by tomorrow's deadline, has established a planning team, signed up for the program and raised $600 to $800 for the connection kit, qualifies for the program. The Southern New England Telephone Company will provide 60 hours of free Internet access each month to each participating institution during the 1996-97 school year. 

 Based on a similar endeavor, Net Day in California, ConneCT96 is sanctioned by the state's leaders in education, government and business. Much of the administrative work is being handled by Citizens for Connecticut's Children and Youth in New Haven. But ultimately, Mr. Larson believes, it is involvement on the local level that will be most important. He discussed his work and theories in a recent interview. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
 Q. What is ConneCT96?
 A. ConneCT96 is our effort to link every school, K through 12, public and private, and every library in the state to the Internet. Connecticut, sadly, ranks about 40th of the 50 states in terms of where we are with respect to wiring. And in a state as affluent as ours, and in a state that clearly has an outstanding reputation in the area of education, this just simply won't do.
 We figure between the public and private schools there are approximately 1,500 schools, of which one-third are done, and there's about another 250-plus libraries. So we figure we have about 1,300 units that have to be wired.
 Q. Why is it so important for all students to have access to the Internet?
 A. I think a strong argument can be made in some of the urban and rural areas of our state that there's inequity with respect to education. That gap will only grow exponentially if we don't address the major concern -- access to information, access to the Internet.
 As a father with three children, I do not want to see my children left behind. I do not want them to become one of the "digital homeless."
 Q. What would the benefits be beyond the classroom, economically and socially?
 A. A group in California did research about the cost of illiteracy and what's going to happen to American businesses that find they're going to have to retrain these people -- something that the public education system should be doing from get-go. If a kid in Hartford or a kid in Bridgeport or New Haven has no clue or no access to this kind of technology, where is he or she? And what are the costs overall then to the society?
 One argument is: There are so many changes in technology that we ought to wait until we can put together the perfect system. There's no such thing as the perfect system. The perfect system is evolving. The idea is to jump out in the middle of the pond -- if it's a good idea, people will swim out and help you. It gives this barn-raising spirit to people; that we're all part of the community.
 Imagine the opportunity for someone in Hartford to be able to distance-learn with somebody in India, or Russia, or China, or Europe. You talk about the appreciation and understanding of cross-cultural learning! And then, within our own state, the ability for people to understand and communicate with kids from surrounding towns. Again, it's many-to-many with a lot of different opinions and a lot of different points of view -- but a better understanding that I believe comes about digitally in terms of the person's expanding their universe.
 I grew up in a housing project -- the greatest experience of my life. But I also understand how confining it was in terms of the opportunities that exist. For people to go anywhere in the world from their desk is just an incredible experience that should not be denied any child. And if we don't seize this opportunity to make sure it happens for all our children, shame on us.
 Q. Do you think access to the Internet will necessarily translate into opportunity?
 A. No. Access to the Internet, in and of itself, isn't going to open up doors magically. It still takes personal initiative. But to be left out, not to have that opportunity, is what we're battling against.
 Q. Do you see this as a natural extension of state education policy or does it represent a departure?
 A. I see it as a natural extension, but it's a departure in terms of the tools that we're using. And that's all these are: educational tools. I truly believe, too, once teachers start experimenting themselves, becoming knowledge navigators, more entreprenuerial about how they disseminate information, there's going to be a tremendous growth in educational professionalism.
 You're going to see educators start copywriting a lot of their work. They've always viewed themselves as altruistic, doing the job because of love of children and belief in their profession. Very few of them ever think about taking and marketing their ideas.
 If knowledge is the future currency, and I believe that it is, then it is critical for us to make sure that we have people that are able to provide us with that knowledge, to train us.
 Q. Does the project correlate with the statewide education technology plan?
 A. Yes. By the time we finish with this project in October, we will have positioned ourselves to be further along than any other state in the Northeast. And with the insurance industry retooling, with defense manufacturers trying to diversify, this state has lost a little bit of its identity. This is a way for us to recapture a focus.

 Q. How about a continuing commitment?
 A. One of the things we plan to do is to take all of the information that we gather -- the website and everything else -- and turn it over to the Department of Education or whatever resource they believe can best handle it. We have regional educational councils all across the state. And they may be an appropriate repository as well.
 That, in of itself, will be a major accomplishment. It's going to require a commitment on the part of the state and on part of local communities and on the part of local business. By virtue of the size of our state, we feel that Connecticut can position itself as an appropriate pilot, thereby being eligible for more federal dollars -- especially in the area of teacher training.
 Q. But the Federal Government might not be the only source of revenues to perpetuate the program, is that right?
 A. Exactly. And I don't think they should be. Fifty percent of the education budget in the state of Connecticut would be generated by the local community. Where does the state get its revenues from? Individuals and corporations. The fact that education, the economy and business are inextricably linked is something that cannot be denied. That's what our future is about.
 Q. Are students contributing to the plan to connect schools?
 A. Yes, and we want to get them more involved. We don't have any specific student sitting on our steering committee yet, but we will.
 Q. How can a school become involved?
 A. Very easy. Have the P.T.A. sit down with the principal and plan where the wiring and modem are going to be -- the media room, the library, classrooms. To sign up -- all they need to do is the basic http://
www.connect96.org and -- bingo! -- they're into the web page, can electronically sign up, and they instantly go on.
 There are some communities that don't have any computers. All they have to do is make a phone call to Citizens for Connecticut's Children and Youth (203) 498-4240.

HEADLINE: Economic Agency Puts Businesses First

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
WESTCHESTER is open for business. But even more important, Westchester is open to business because the state's business climate has changed, say New York State economic professionals.
 "Under business-friendly Governor Pataki, New York State government isn't looking at business as a cash cow," said Edward L. Arace, regional director of Empire State Development's Mid-Hudson regional office in Fishkill. "Business isn't looked at as something to be arrogantly and punitively overtaxed and over-regulated but something to be wooed." 

 Under Gov. George E. Pataki, four economic development agencies, which were duplicating services and staff, were consolidated under one umbrella, called the Empire State Development agency.
 Under this program, business is put first, Mr. Arace said. "It is to that end that we've streamlined our administration into one unified economic agency, Empire State Development," he said, adding that the revamped economic development program has slashed bureaucracy, cut taxes and eliminated red tape.
 "We did this by consolidating existing agencies and staff, by reducing our product line of programs from over 100 to 200 and by making the application process for those looking for state financial aid or technical assistance much simpler, with only just one form required," he said. "It's one-stop shopping at its best. Products and services are easily accessible through our regional office network where our business customers can get accurate, first-rate answers and decisions promptly."
 Under the new program, Westchester County has a full-time economic-development specialist, Louis C. Kirven 3d. Mr. Kirven, who has an office in the Westchester County Association headquarters, is accessible to any Westchester business seeking his help.
 His efforts are meant to complement services being provided by the Westchester County Association and the Westchester District Exports Assistance Center.
 "What we have is really a partnership between New York State and Westchester County," Mr. Arace said. "We work on everything together, things like retaining existing business, helping others expand, and we are trying to attract new business to the county. The state is committed to Westchester. It's super important to us; it not only has the highest concentration of Fortune 500 headquarters outside of Manhattan, but it has a very well-educated work force."
 The county's strategic location, adjoining New York City, and its concentration of high-tech companies are also tremendous assets, Mr. Arace added.
 "We like to work with local development specialists in each area to get a feeling of the place," Mr. Kirven said.
 "Recently, Mr. Arace and I went on a walking tour of White Plains with Margo Jones, who is the executive director of the White Plains Business Development Corporation, to familiarize ourselves with the city. It's easier to see the buildings and the vacant spaces on foot. We saw space available for new business. We saw locations; we learned the dynamics of the city so we would be able to pass information on to interested parties."
 Mr. Kirven, 33, is a graduate of Georgetown University in Washington, and a lawyer who worked as a corporate attorney aide to Senator H. John Heinz 3d of Pennsylvania, a moderate Republican who died in a plane crash in 1991, and then-Senator John Seymour, a Republican of California. He has also had first-hand small-business experience as a co-founder of a start-up sports goods company in Washington.
 "I knew immediately that this was the ideal job for me," he said. "I've been in Westchester since April and seeing customers respond to the new business-friendly climate is astounding."
 "Customers, that's how we think of business people now," Mr. Arace explained. "Our Commissioner, Charles A. Gargano, has made our job one of customer service. Business, our customer, is to be treated with respect in hopes of making additional sales." The new program, Mr. Arace said, covers a lot of bases.
 He said: "We can provide help to those evaluating business locations or to those investigating options for a new site as well those looking for financial or technical assistance to help their business grow. Our economic professionals, like Lou Kirven, work directly with customers, providing them with business access to our entire array of products and services for business in New York State."
 Mr. Arace's office in Fishkill covers the region that includes eight Mid-Hudson counties and Westchester. The office serves as the focal point for the one-stop-shopping approach for companies already in the state.
 "Fifty percent of the population in our region lives in Westchester," he observed. "Westchester, as counties go, has a wealth of resources and that includes workers that rank among the top in the country. Not only are they well educated but they have a very strong work ethic and a willingness and ability to learn new skills, something business is always looking for."
 Experts in Albany and New York City, he continued, provide the same service to out-of-state companies through Empire State Development's strategic business division. International specialists are also on hand, ready to guide business into import and export ventures around the globe.
 And how has business responded to the new program?
 "Beyond our wildest expectations," Mr. Arace said. "Everyday we are receiving inquiries from companies in other areas and other states who are looking at New York again now that the word is out that we are hospitable to business. For instance, we worked with Oxford Health Plan, who, with 1,000 employees, moved from Connecticut to White Plains six months ago."
 Mr. Kirven has also met and gone to visit a large pharmaceutical company in a neighboring state that he said was "looking very seriously at Westchester with an eye to relocation, and I've seen a chemical company interested in moving its headquarters here, plus a number of smaller businesses including a bakery, a janitorial service and a charter airline company, who all are interested in expansion."
 Ever eager to expand the state's economy, Mr. Arace is taking the Empire State message overseas in October: New York is a better place to do business.
 "We're setting out to drum up business in Europe, selling our state as the place to be for business," he said.
 "We will be meeting with business people in England and Germany and hope to interest them in establishing offices, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities and joint ventures, investments, whatever, in New York State. We are the center of world markets. The richest market in the world is within a radius of 750 miles of New York."
 For more information and assistance, the number to call is 896-0478.
 
The Economic Power of New York
 
 Among attractions that New York offers business, the Empire State Development agency says, are the following.
 *New York's gross state product is $506 billion a year, close to 8 percent of the country's gross domestic product compared with a share of under 7 percent of the country's population.
 *New York's commercial bank assets per capita are almost triple the national average. Seven of the country's leading commercial banks, including 5 of the top 10, have headquarters in New York State.
 *New York leads the nation as the favorite location for Fortune 500 headquarters, with 65, followed by California with 51.
 *New York accounts for close to 18 percent or $761 billion of the Fortune 500's total revenues. The combined purchasing power of the state's residents pushes retail sales in New York to more than $134 billion a year.
 *International investors love New York. In 1993, the state attracted more than $7 billion in foreign direct investment -- far more than any other state. Overall foreign investment was up 87 percent from 1987 to 1992.
 *The New York Stock Exchange alone accounts for approximately 85 percent of the total capitalization in the country. PENNY SINGER

HEADLINE: Plan for a Tower Surprised Board

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I'd like to clarify your article "Gone Before It Ever Arrived: The Quotron" (July 7), about Community Board 1's opposition to the city's plan to build a tower -- with steel flag and stock quotes -- as part of its conversion of a block of Washington Street into a pedestrian walkway. 

 The article states that the board was "furious" when the Tribeca Trib "reported the million-dollar plan for Washington Street. . . . When they saw a drawing of the Quotron, the board, which has many architects and artists on it, grew angrier."
 Though they believed that the million dollars could be better spent improving Greenwich Street, the board was not angry about the overall plan to turn that block of Washington Street into a walkway. They gave tentative approval to the concept in 1993. They were upset not only because they dislike the tower's design; they also say the Quotron was not part of the plan they approved. And for two months after publication of our article, Economic Development Corporation officials continued to argue otherwise.
 The Tribeca Trib obtained construction drawings for the whole project and published an article that explained the details of the street plan but focused on the board's apparent lack of knowledge that the tower was part of it.

HEADLINE: NEIGBORHOOD REPORT: DOWNTOWN BROOKLYN;
Campaign Trail, Over Internet, Up to Vermont

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
It may seem a bit nutty that Prof. August St. John, who teaches marketing and future studies at the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University, commutes from Vermont. But the 68-year-old academic, who specializes in economic forecasting and is known in his home state as "Dr. Doom and Gloom," rarely takes the conventional route to anything.
 Besides, said Professor St. John, who teaches on Tuesdays and Wednesdays but is off for the summer, those 10 driving hours are the prime moments of a prophet's work. "It's quiet," he said, "and I get these thoughts." 

 On the weekly commute from Manchester, where he has lived since 1987, Professor St. John might consider a prediction that Taiwan will rejoin China in or by the year 2000, work up a forecast of major breakthroughs in the study of gravity or prepare a speech on his theory that all of New England will soon become two "megastates."
 His latest vision is of himself as governor of Vermont. He is running as an independent candidate against the Democratic incumbent, Gov. Howard Dean, and said he had about 500 of the 1,000 signatures required to put him on the ballot for the November election.
 Not surprisingly, his approach to campaigning is unusual: he is stumping on the Internet in what is believed to be the nation's first virtual gubernatorial campaign. Professor St. John, who has taught at L.I.U. since 1963, said that if elected he would request a leave of absence.
 The "St. John for Governor" site on the World Wide Web, accessible at http://www.acmeville.com/
stjohn/, welcomes visitors with, "Congratulations! You are now part of electronic electoral history!" It is sprinkled with sound-byte descriptions of the candidate -- "Manchester's prophet!" and "A real showman!" -- culled from local articles. Site visitors can also find a section where the professor quotes himself extensively ("There is no imagination in this state!"). His Web site, available since early May, trumpeted that 70 visitors had stopped by as of last Tuesday.
 The reaction in Vermont to Professor St. John's bid for governor -- much like the response to his theories and predictions -- is a mix of skepticism and amusement. "He's an entertainer," said Arthur Woolf, an associate professor of economics at the University of Vermont. "He's into self-aggrandizement."
 Professor St. John uses traditional indicators like unemployment, development and investing to make economic forecasts. But he also uses alternative techniques, such as studying utility bills to see how many customers are postponing payments, or cruising through towns looking for smiles. "When people stop laughing and smiling, it's a sign the town isn't doing well," he said.
 Some of his visions of recessions and industry layoffs in New England have come true, although his critics say those events were imminent before his forecasts. "He predicts everything, and when you predict a list long enough, something's bound to come true," said Professor Woolf, who served for three years as Vermont's chief economist.
 What does Professor St. John see for New York? By about 2010, the five boroughs and Long Island will break off from the rest of the state into a new state called New York, New York. "I've always had a problem with New York," he said. "It's aberrational because of all the different life styles. But in a couple of years, I'll have it all laid out." SARAH KERSHAW

HEADLINE: Integration Suit: 7 Years Later

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL

 BODY:
MILO SHEFF was an 11-year-old fourth grader in 1989 when his mother, Elizabeth Horton Sheff, helped bring a landmark desegregation lawsuit on behalf of her son and 16 other plaintiffs seeking racial balance in Hartford's predominantly black and Hispanic public school system.
 So it was no surprise that both mother and son were jubilant after last week's ruling by the State Supreme Court that racial segregation in Hartford's public schools violated Connecticut's Constitution. The decision reversed a ruling last year by Superior Court Judge Harry Hammer, who held that the plantiffs had failed to prove the state was liable for racial imbalance and segregation. 

 Mr. Sheff, now 17 and about to enter his senior year at Weaver High School, said he had been crushed by Judge Hammer's ruling in April 1995, which led to a month of almost daily protests and demonstrations in the state capital. Further angering some people at the time was Gov. John G. Rowland's breaking out a bottle of champagne at a press conference to celebrate the lower court's ruling.
 But Ms. Horton Sheff and her son said there were no thoughts of champagne last Tuesday when they heard about the higher court's 4-to-3 decision that ends, at least for now, a high profile, seven-year court battle known as Sheff v. O'Neill. (Milo Sheff was the first plaintiff listed in the suit and William A. O'Neill was Governor when the suit was filed.) "I realize that it's too late for me to benefit from this ruling," Mr. Sheff said. "But I just want to see some kind of action taken as soon as possible so that other students can start getting the equal education they need and deserve."
 Ms. Horton Sheff and her son said they thought about all they had been through since the lawsuit was filed, how disappointed they were when the initial ruling went against them last year, but most of all how much support they have received over the years. They said they wanted to savor the victory for a while -- and then start thinking about what it really means and how it can be carried out.
 The court's 95-page ruling does not order any specific remedies, but instead directs the General Assembly and the executive branch to "put the search for appropriate remedial measures at the top of their respective agendas." Governor Rowland said he would abide by the latest ruling, although he and others acknowledged that remedial action would take time.
 Ms. Horton Sheff, a former two-term Hartford City Councilwoman and an unsuccessful independent mayoral candidate, said she never doubted that in the end justice would prevail, but admitted to being "completely overwhelmed" when she heard of the decision on Tuesday.
 "I know that change, real change often takes time and happens slowly," Ms. Horton Sheff said. "But today is the day we celebrate that our children's constitutional rights have been upheld. Tomorrow, we can begin the process of coming up with specific solutions. The best remedies will come from a wide range of individuals who must come together in a collaborative effort for all of our children." Ms. Horton Sheff refused to speculate about whether that could lead to the busing of suburban children to urban schools. After a poll taken after last year's ruling found 64 percent of white residents supported the lower court's ruling, she said she was certain what many suburbanites feared was busing. "It's the B word that they're afraid of," she said at the time. "B for busing."
 But busing, at least, will not be part of the remedy, according to Governor Rowland, Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and legislative leaders of both parties, all of whom say they will begin meeting soon to make some kind of long-term plan to meet the court's directive.
 They all also agreed that it would probably be difficult to convene a special legislative session, and that any action would most likely have to wait until the General Assembly convenes for its regular January session.
 As for busing, Mr. Rowland said, "As long as I'm Governor, that is not one of the solutions."
 "The problem of school segregation in our urban areas is a very complicated problem with deep running social and economic causes," he continued. "I do not expect any quick answers and I cannot predict what the remedies will be." The decision, Mr. Rowland said, "has major implications for state policies on education in general, school budgets, municipal government and taxes."
 Mr. Blumenthal, who presented the state's case before the Supreme Court, indicated after the ruling that he would fight to insure that local control of the school system is preserved. He said that he "profoundly disagreed" with the court's ruling and feared what would happen if city and suburban school systems are forced to participate in regional desegregation. "At least for the next school year, the present system will remain in effect, and students will attend the same schools they do now," said Mr. Blumenthal.
 But John Brittain, the plaintiff's lead attorney, said that the court's ruling, particularly the majority opinion written by Chief Justice Ellen Ash Peters, directs the state to take immediate action to correct not only inequities in Hartford, but also those in all the state's urban centers.
 "This decision," he said, "is clearly an historic one that is going to have a far-reaching impact on education throughout Connecticut and will have an inspirational impact across the country." Mr. Brittain, a University of Connecticut law professor, had expressed confidence last year that the initial ruling would be overturned.
 "We have waited long enough for change and have had to stand by and watch the state's committed, but feeble, efforts to eradicate racial imbalance and inequality," Mr. Brittain said. "The fact that Justice Peters uses the word urgency several times, does, I think, mean that the state needs to formulate and begin enacting some kind of a plan within the next six months."
 In her majority opinion, Justice Peters wrote that "the needy school children of Hartford have waited long enough," and that under the existing educational system "every passing day denies these children their constitutional right to a substantially equal educational opportunity. Every passing day shortchanges these children and their ability to learn to contribute to their own well-being and to that of this state and nation."
 In a dissenting opinion, however, Justice David M. Borden said that "the majority has used this court's power to interpret the constitution in order to mandate a vast and unprecedented social experiment, using the state's schools and school children as test data, and thereby to construct what the majority perceives to be the necessary bridge over the racial divide."
 He added: "Without explicitly saying so, the majority has effectively struck down, not just for the greater Hartford area, but for the entire state, the municipality-based school system that has been in effect in this state since 1909." Justice Borden went on to say that "the legislature, if it is to take seriously its responsibilities under the majority's mandate, will have few options, if any, other than a state-wide realignment of school districts, accompanied by a state-wide transportation system."
 Key legislators say that the General Assembly must proceed with caution. "I think we're all a little stunned and taken aback by the ruling and I think the Governor is right when he said we have to take our time with this," said State Senator Judith Freedman, Republican of Westport and a chairperson of the General Assembly's Education Committee. "We have a lot of options that we have to carefully examine, and that's going to take time."
 State Representative Cameron Staples, Democrat of New Haven and the other chairperson of the Education Committee, added that "clearly the ball is now in our court and we have to come up with some kind of integration plan that meets the needs of all of the state's public education people."
 Meanwhile, Ms. Horton Sheff and her son said they were just happy that the case, which went to an 11-week trial in 1992, was finally over. (It cannot be appealed further in the state courts.)
 "Seven years ago I was a naive kid who dreamed about the kind of happy endings you see on TV and in the movies," Mr. Sheff said. "It was tough at times," he added, "but in the end the good guys won."

HEADLINE: Mongolian Democracy Deserves U.S. Gesture

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Three cheers for Mongolian democracy ("Mongolia Swaps Leaders," editorial, July 10)! 
 Mongolia's victorious Democratic Union Coalition now faces the daunting task of reversing Mongolia's slide in its standard of living and of demonstrating that a free, market-based democracy brings tangible socioeconomic rewards, not just greater civil liberties.
But with legislators of the caliber of Hashbat Hulan of the Mongolian National Democratic Party, a landslide electoral mandate and an ally in President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, there is no challenge that Mongolia cannot meet.
Meanwhile, the United States would make a grave error if it passed up this golden opportunity to expand its strategic, economic and cultural ties with Mongolia. President Clinton should not be content with sending various envoys as he has in the past but should go and pay a visit himself. Mongolia deserves no less.

HEADLINE: U.N. Survey Finds World Rich-Poor Gap Widening

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 12

 BODY:
In the wake of reports that gaps between rich and poor in the United States are wider than they have been in half a century, a United Nations survey to be published on Wednesday finds that the phenomenon is worldwide, and that the wealthiest and poorest people -- both within and among countries -- are living in increasingly separate worlds.
Moreover, the United States is slipping into a category of countries -- among them Brazil, Britain and Guatemala -- where economic stratification is most pronounced, with the national per capita income four times or more higher than the average income of the poor, according to the survey, the Human Development Report 1996, compiled by the United Nations Development Program. 
 The ratio of the top 20 percent of American incomes to the poorest 20 percent is now 9 to 1, the study shows.
"An emerging global elite, mostly urban-based and interconnected in a variety of ways, is amassing great wealth and power, while more than half of humanity is left out," said James Gustave Speth, an American who is administrator of the Development Program.
"We still have more than half the people on the planet with incomes of less than $2 a day -- more than 3 billion people," Mr. Speth said in an interview on Thursday. "For poor people in this two-class world, it is a breeding ground for hopelessness, for anger, for frustration."
The Human Development report will be released officially in Tokyo on Wednesday by Richard Jolly, its principal author.
A nation's total wealth is not an adequate guide to how its people live, the survey says. In nations as diverse as the Netherlands, Japan, Bangladesh and Nepal, the gap between average incomes and those of the poorest 20 percent of the population is half that of the United States.
The distribution of private economic assets, in property and investments, widen American differences even more.
Many of the most equitable societies are now in East and Southeast Asia, where economic growth has been fastest but where at the same time the division of national wealth has been the fairest, the report says.
The annual Human Development Report was first published in 1990 as a new way to measure countries' progress by going beyond gross national product to factor in life expectancy, education and adjusted real incomes. The report's Human Development Index ranks countries by health, sanitation, the treatment of women and other aspects of life that give what the authors believe is a truer picture of day-to-day existence.
This year, Canada leads the index with the most advanced overall human development, followed by the United States, Japan, the Netherlands and Norway. On a list of 174 countries, Russia ranks 57th, China 108th and India 135th. Africa south of the Sahara dominates the bottom.
When the list is adjusted to reflect the status of women, the United States drops to fourth place among 137 countries, behind Sweden, Canada and Norway. Japan drops to 12th place, while China rises to 79th.
The 1996 report introduces another new measure of national growth -- or lack of it. Called a "capability poverty measure," this index tries to find hidden or potential poverty by looking at factors like the percentage of children under 5 who are underweight, the proportion of unattended births, the number of children in school and rate of female illiteracy. In other words, is a nation programming poverty and disadvantage into coming generations?
For example, in South Asia -- India and its neighbors, except Sri Lanka -- 29 percent of the people are living in severe poverty when income alone is measured, but more than 62 percent are living in conditions that can negatively affect their futures.
John Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, a private policy research organization in Washington, said in an interview that social indicators can no longer be overlooked by any country focused on national economic growth. The era of choosing between a welfare state or a bigger G.N.P. is over; social and economic factors work together, he said.
"It is clear by now in the developing world that the prime responsibility for progress has to fall to those governments and societies themselves," he said. "Nothing much is going to change until countries take the steps to invest in people, educate women and create a health care system that works while also adopting policies that are going to lead to economic growth."
In Asia, as in the Scandinavian countries a generation or more ago, a number of countries -- among them Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore -- have spent significant sums on health, education, the advancement of women and the provision of credit to low-income families and small-scale entrepreneurs. But they also focused simultaneously on national economic growth, and this two-track policy led to "the most sustained and widespread development miracle of the 20th century, perhaps all history," the report says.
At the independent Cato Institute in Washington, Ian Vasquez, director of the Project on Global Economic Liberty, is skeptical about more foreign aid and about reports by agencies with an interest in continuing or expanding assistance programs.
"The evidence over the past 30 to 40 years shows quite clearly that economic reforms, especially of the market-oriented type, help raise the standards of living dramatically more than traditional programs supported by foreign aid agencies like the U.N.D.P.," Mr. Vasquez said in an interview.
"The real story is that the conditions of people around the world have vastly improved over the last 50 or so years," he said. Progress rests with liberalizing economic policies, not outside support, he added.
Among the 1996 Human Development report's other findings are these:
*Worldwide, 358 billionaires control assets greater than the combined annual incomes of countries with 45 percent of the world's people.
*Eighty-nine countries are worse off economically than they were a decade or more ago. In 70 developing countries, incomes are lower than they were in the 1960's or 1970's. In 19 countries, including Ghana, Haiti, Liberia, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Venezuela, per capita income is below the 1960 level.
The Human Development Report 1996 is published by Oxford University Press at $18.95 in paperback and $29.95 in hard cover.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
The Swimmer Who United a Nation

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C., July 14

 BODY:
She may have been Germany's richest and most famous teen-ager, but Franziska van Almsick was also its most jet-lagged. Her body arrived at the pool with Germany's other Olympic swimmers on Saturday morning, but her mind and her luggage were elsewhere.
After her workout, German television wanted to beam a live interview back to Europe. Germany cannot get enough of this 18-year-old phenom, the winner of four medals as a 14-year-old at the 1992 Summer Games, the world champion in the 200-meter freestyle, the casually outspoken star who has become the photogenic symbol of the possibilities of reunification. 
 Whatever athletic and political needs the Germans seem to have, Franzi, as she is known, appears to fill them. When she checked into the team hotel on Friday, her coach introduced her to a desk clerk as Germany's Michael Jordan.
But the TV interview would require a drive to a nearby studio, and van Almsick had done enough traveling for the moment. She did not want to go anywhere in a car, she told an American attache with the German team. Not that anyone in Germany would forget what she looked like if she declined the interview.
Her face appears frequently on television, on billboards, on the covers of magazines and newspapers. She once had her own TV show. If she is not being written about, or trailed by paparazzi, she is endorsing every product from bread to automobiles. Her sponsorship contracts, German reporters said, total $9 million through 2001.
This time, though, Franzi had nothing to say to her worshipers back home. She slumped onto a bench at the North Carolina State University pool, leaning against a wall with a weariness in her posture and her voice.
"I am very tired," she said.
In a day, or two, she would be fine, of course. She has a teen-ager's resilience, which may be at the heart of why she is so popular at home.
She is pretty. She is a fresh new face in the gallery of familiar German stars like Steffi Graf and Boris Becker. And she has managed to be opinionated while still being regarded as an innocent. But that does not fully explain her appeal as the first big star of German reunification.
Van Almsick serves as a sort of political Zelig, morphing seamlessly into whatever symbol needs validation at the moment. She is an eastern German who provides the hope of success for those who lived in the dismantled communist system. At the same time, she provides comfort to western Germans who were suspicious about the economic and social drain of reunification. For both sides, she authenticated the merging of East and West at the 1992 Games in Barcelona, Spain.
"She is a girl that fits everyone's needs," said the German freestyler Bjorn Zikarsky, who holds a business administration degree from the University of Southern California. "She represents the new face after reunification. She's athletic, young, good looking, cute, rebellious. She says what's on her mind."
"When the wall came down," Zikarsky said, "the West was seen as the winner, the East as the loser. But she showed that the East German character is very strong. She gave a lot of confidence to other East German athletes, politicians, business people."
To western Germans, he said, van Almsick represents a refreshing departure from the former East German system of swimming, whose success, it has since been revealed, was fueled by persistent use of performance-enhancing steroids. "She was a clean girl," Zikarsky said.
Her popularity remains buoyant despite evidence that her mother, Jutta, a coach, served as an informer for the former East German secret police, the Stasi. And despite her own remarks that she was interested in Hitler as a historical figure. Her mother disputes the Stasi allegations. And van Almsick's supporters said she never endorsed the extremist views of Hitler, but suffered when some reporters twisted her words.
Germans take a larger, more sympathetic view of what van Almsick represents to a united country. They relish the cheeky Franzi, who once greeted Chancellor Helmut Kohl in jeans and a leather jacket. And the curious Franzi, who grew up 500 meters from the Berlin wall, once kicking a soccer ball over the top of it, then repeating the act several times when it kept coming back.
"Timing is everything," Zikarsky said. "The West was waiting to see what was in the East. She is a young, fresh character who satisfies the demands for character on both ends. Sometimes she puts her foot in her mouth, but that doesn't seem to bother people. They want someone to look up to."
Van Almsick was only 11 when the wall came down in 1989, and she professes an amnesia about communist life in East Germany, though she continues to live in the eastern part of Berlin. Perhaps it is a convenient amnesia, but few seem to mind.
"My life began as the wall fell down," she said. "I can't remember a time in East Germany."
The tabloid life is hard sometimes, she said, with requests for autographs interrupting her meals, and the papers reporting everything she does. But she is 18, after all, so she understands perfectly what it is to be a teen idol.
"If I see Boris Becker or Michael Jordan, I would like their autographs, too," she said.
While she took four medals in Barcelona, none of them was gold. Gold is the expectation this time, but van Almsick can be as erratic in the pool as she is popular out of the pool.
At the 1994 world championships in Rome, she did not qualify for the final of the 200 freestyle, only to have her teammate Dagmar Hase, a 1992 Olympic champion, give up her spot to van Almsick. Some saw the switch as a buyout. Van Almsick proceeded to win and set a world record. At the recent German Olympic trials, she failed to qualify in the 400 freestyle and finished second in the 100 freestyle. A nation edgily awaits her success or failure in Atlanta.
"I don't think about medals," she said. "I will do the best I can do."
One thing is certain: Even if van Almsick does not win the most medals among the Germans, she will get the most attention.
"Certain people are jealous," Zikarsky said. "They say, 'I wish I could make a third of what she makes.' But who said life is fair?"

HEADLINE: At Home Abroad;
Enemy At Scarsdale

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea

 BODY:
It is hard to imagine war coming to a place so bursting with prosperity and consumerism. Seoul is a city of 10 million now dotted with skyscrapers. Shoppers crowd colorful street markets and new shopping malls.
But the border is just 30 miles from Seoul, and on the other side is a state that vows to overthrow South Korea. It is as if New Yorkers lived with an implacable enemy country beginning at Scarsdale. 
 If North Korea made a sudden attack across the border, it would do devastating damage. It has 11,000 artillery pieces, some of them rocket-launchers that can hit Seoul. It is also believed to have chemical weapons.
But whatever the initial damage it caused, North Korea would surely be crushed in time. Its desperate economy could not long sustain a war. The U.S., which has 37,000 troops here, would respond massively from the air.
For those reasons most people here, South Korean and American, tend to dismiss the possibility of war. The Pyongyang regime would have to be irrational to attack, they say, because it would be destroyed. But will Kim Jong Il and his colleagues define rationality as we do?
Consider the current U.S. policy of trying to engage the North Koreans in negotiations, offering economic assistance in return. The reality is that such aid could not by itself erase the North's accelerating economic decline. The only way to do that would be structural reform in North Korea: ending rigid Communist doctrine in industry and agriculture, and bringing in managers from South Korea and elsewhere.
In other words, turning the economy around would require abandonment of socialism and isolation, the two doctrines that have defined the state's rigid ideology since Kim Il Sung imposed it 50 years ago. And that would undermine the legitimacy of the Kim dynasty. In those circumstances, a war with poor prospects might look more "rational" to the regime than its certain destruction by an inexorable economic slide toward absorption by the South.
No one can know what may be in the minds of Pyongyang's leaders. The toughest analysts here do not argue that war is more likely than not. Nor do they oppose the policy of trying to engage North Korea. They simply say that we should be wary -- and not put our hopes for the policy too high.
Is Pyongyang interested in "engagement"? It has invited U.S. officials to search for the remains of Americans missing since the Korean War ended in 1953. But, tellingly, it has not responded to the proposal by Washington and Seoul last April for four-party talks, with China as the fourth, on a Korean peace treaty. Indeed, Pyongyang has not even accepted an offer to brief its representatives on the idea.
Moreover, North Korea continues its bloodcurdling propaganda against the South. This month among other things its spokesmen have called President Kim Young Sam of South Korea and his colleagues "traitors" and said, "We will make them pay for their crimes a thousandfold."
Optimists on bringing the North into talks argue that China under Deng Xiaoping made major economic reforms without undoing the Communist Party's power. But the Pyongyang regime reflects not just the extreme Communist ideology of the Kims but an extreme North Korean tradition of puritan Confucianism, with rule from the top. And the regime faces a competitor in South Korea quite unlike anything that had to concern Deng Xiaoping.
Top South Korean officials take what seems to be a calm view of the economic crisis in the North and where it might lead. They say they see signs of more pragmatism among younger figures in North Korea. But they are uneasy about the total lack of response from Pyongyang to the proposal for four-power peace talks.
The engagement policy has a difficulty on the American side, too. It is open to demagogic attack as "appeasement" of North Korea. Indeed Bob Dole has already taken that line, calling a recent U.S. offer of modest humanitarian food aid a subsidy to the totalitarian regime.
Republicans in Congress have voted to cut in half the $25 million needed this year to supply fuel oil to North Korea as part of the 1994 agreement for a freeze of its nuclear program. I have met no one here, American or South Korean, optimist or pessimist, who thinks the United States can reduce the risks of the present situation on the Korean Peninsula by breaking its commitments.

HEADLINE: Taking In the Sites;
Each Fed Web Site Has Its Own Form and Flavor

BYLINE: By SCOTT WOOLLEY 

 BODY:
The secretive Federal Reserve, for decades the arbiter of monetary policy and regulator of banks, has recently undertaken a new and very public sideline: developing sites on the World Wide Web.
The Fed's Web sites are home to some of the Government's best on-line economic data and analysis. Unfortunately, as with much of the Internet, the trick for potential users of the Fed sites is first to realize that useful information exists, then hunt through the clutter to find it. 
 The Fed's organizational structure does not help. Each of the Fed's 12 district banks is responsible for setting up its own home page, and there is no standard format. A particular statistic or study available from one bank's site may not exist on its sister sites. And even if it does, it is quite possibly filed under a different section.
The up side of this individualism is the range of features and information available at these sites. Each Fed district has its own economists doing their own research, and much of it is narrowly targeted to issues in its particular region.
For instance, the San Francisco Fed offers opinions on employment in Silicon Valley's computer industry. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia bank's research department surveys that region's manufacturing industries.
The Fed's well-known beige book, which analyzes the overall economic prospects of each of the 12 districts, is now available at the Minneapolis Fed's Web site.
Besides regional economic data, there is also a host of national information available. The New York Fed generates its own estimates of foreign exchange rates and posts them on the Web twice daily. Other information, like recent commercial paper rates, is also on line.
One sign that the Fed has yet to become truly Web-friendly: some of the most up-to date interest rates, including commercial paper rates, are available on a telephone recording within a day of being set. That data at times do not make it to the Web for up to a week.
The St. Louis Fed has one of the snappiest of the Fed's home pages. Its site houses FRED, or Federal Reserve Economic Data, a data base that offers a mix of information as diverse as consumer credit and the money supply. Major Fed studies are supposed to be posted on FRED within hours of release.
One of FRED's new features, F.T.P. mail, allows users looking for data to have it E-mailed directly to them instead of taking the time to pull it off the Web every time it is updated. This feature can be a time- saver for users who want to download data regularly -- chief financial officers, for example, who want the three-month commercial paper rate every week.
Except for the Richmond district, all the Fed banks now have sites, as does the Fed's board of governors in Washington. All the sites are linked, so it is easy to skip among them.
While the scope of the Fed's economic data is not nearly as comprehensive as some other Federal sites -- especially the Commerce Department's Stat USA site -- it does offer access to the central bank's unusual research strengths. And unlike the bigger Commerce site, which charges a $50 annual subscriber fee, none of the 12 Fed sites cost users a penny.

HEADLINE: Capitalist Tools Benefit Ukraine Collectives

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BASHTANKA, Ukraine

 BODY:
Across Ukraine, great plains of tall, tawny wheat are ripening under hot skies and gentle breezes in what was once the breadbasket of the Soviet Union.
Sergiy Arkhipov, one of the nation's new breed of private farmers, is excited by the prospects of a good harvest for himself and the nearly 1,000 other private farmers in the region. 
 But not everything is going his way this season.
Mr. Arkhipov and his colleagues, who have deserted the large, inefficient state farms to blaze their own path to agricultural entrepreneurship, have been shut out, he said, from receiving any of the 600 American combines that are arriving in Ukraine. The state-of-the-art John Deere machines are far superior to the old Soviet ones, which also harvest and thresh the grain but leave up to 30 percent of it behind on the ground.
The new American machines have been going to a state-controlled company that is reselling them, or trading them for grain, to collective farms and Government-run agricultural centers.
The Clinton Administration helped to bring about the transaction, even though critics say it goes against the stated thrust of American policy, which has been to prod Ukraine to adopt a market economy.
The deal, completed earlier this year, is the biggest single export sale ever by John Deere. Altogether, the Illinois-based farm machinery giant is selling Ukraine 1,049 combines, for $187 million.
The sale pleased the Clinton Administration because it represented exports and jobs for an American company, as well as support for a country newly independent of Russia that was giving up its nuclear warheads.
And the deal would not have been possible if the Export-Import Bank, an arm of the United States Government that helps finance American exports, had not opened up its credit windows to Ukraine, which it did after persistent pressure from the White House.
Now, instead of promoting private agriculture, say the critics -- who include some American and World Bank officials as well as Ukrainian farmers and Western agricultural experts -- the John Deere deal is reinforcing the old collective farm system, run by corrupt agricultural bosses.
When the Deere sale was still under discussion, the World Bank representative in Ukraine, Daniel Kaufman, bluntly told American Embassy officials in Kiev that it "flew in the face" of economic reform in Ukraine.
Mr. Kaufman, a strong advocate of private investment in Ukraine, said he was troubled that all the combines were being sold to a single state-controlled company with close connections to the state agricultural administrators and provincial farm bosses, the most politically and economically regressive elements in Ukraine.
David Sweere, a Minnesota agribusinessman who is investing $25 million in agricultural operations in Ukraine, called it "the recapitalization of Communism."
He said the deal could have been structured so that individual farmers or farm organizations were given credit to buy the combines.
Since achieving independence in 1991, Ukraine has received nearly a billion dollars from the United States Agency for International Development and other Washington agencies. Today Ukraine is the third-largest recipient of American aid, after Egypt and Israel.
The aid has been intended to turn the Government away from central planning and toward a market economy, particularly in agriculture, which is one of the country's most important sectors.
But Ukraine's leaders have not always been committed to economic liberalization. Their weak economic performance and their default in 1993 on a $70 million, Export-Import-backed loan to the agricultural sector prompted the bank to suspend loan guarantees for Ukraine.
As a result of the Ex-Im Bank's policy, many American companies were reluctant to invest, in spite of the potential offered by the Texas-size country with 52 million people.
When Leonid Kuchma was elected President in mid-1994, he appeared to be a stronger reformer than his predecessor, and he beseeched Washington to restore Ukraine's access to the Ex-Im Bank, something the White House also wanted.
A "classic Washington bureaucratic battle" followed, said one official familiar with the discussions within the Administration. Some Washington officials remained skeptical about Ukraine's commitment to economic reform and were disturbed about its high level of corruption. Others argued that it was important to reward Ukraine for its tentative steps toward reform.
There was also desire to shore up Ukraine's independence from Russia and to insure that Ukraine finished dismantling its nuclear arsenal. These issues were behind President Clinton's visit to Kiev in May 1995, and it was felt that he had to offer more than words of encouragement. He did -- the Export-Import Bank would be open for credit to Ukraine, he announced during the visit.
A few months later, John Deere and Ukraine reached an agreement in principle and began working on the details.
"The idea was that this was a way of showing Ukraine how to make some money," a Washington official said. It was "a political decision to go ahead with the Ex-Im loan," the official said. "The bankerly caution of Ex-Im was overruled."
There is another disturbing aspect of the deal, free-market advocates say: the company that bought the combines, which is 77 percent owned by the state, did so without competitive bidding, even though Ukrainian law requires tenders for all Government purchases of more than $100,000.
The company, Ukragroprombirzha, is headed by Viktor N. Tymchenko, a somewhat mysterious figure.
Ukrainians and Western diplomats said that Mr. Tymchenko, whose calling card describes him as an "honored economist of Ukraine," has long been a behind-the-scenes power in the Agriculture Ministry, and his friends are collective farm directors and provincial leaders.
According to the Ex-Im Bank, the precise numbers and kinds of farmers who would use the combines are considered proprietary information. But a spokeswoman, Rita Flynn, said it would be inaccurate to say that the combines would not benefit the private sector. She added that the deal met the bank's criteria of reasonable assurance of repayment and promoting jobs in the United States.
Mr. Tymchenko said through a company partner that he was too busy to be interviewed. But in an interview with a Ukrainian magazine, Mr. Tymchenko said that the combines would be sold to farmers for $252,000 each.
This would net a profit of about $50,000 on each machine, according to the calculations of an American farmer in Ukraine, Charles Mitchell.
Mr. Mitchell, who has set up a company called Global Agricultural Management in Kiev, said he had bought four of the same Deere combines for $112,000 for use in Ukraine. He is planning to lease them to farmers but said that if he sold them they would go for about $160,000. Even adding attachments, spare parts and training, the price of the machine should be no more than $190,000, farm experts said.
A John Deere executive, Rudolf Steffenhagan, who has been handling the contract in Kiev, said the company had no say over how Mr. Tymchenko disposed of the combines.
"He knows his friends," Mr. Steffenhagan said. "When you look at the map of where the machines are going, he must have an agreement with all the oblast chiefs," the government leaders in the provinces.
So far, nearly all of the combines have been sold to collective farms or to state-run agricultural centers, which lease machinery to farms, say Western officials in Kiev.
In Bashtanka, in southern Ukraine, for example, three combines have gone to a former hard-line Communist politician, Mikola Bardachov.
When a group of private farmers with large holdings in Bashtanka asked about renting the machines, they were told by Mr. Bardachov's office that the combines were for collective farms only, said Mr. Arkhipov, who is chairman of the local association of private farmers.
In Donetsk, the most populous province in Ukraine, it is the Governor, Vladimir Scherban, who has been given power over 40 combines. In an interview, he said they would go to collective farms and to the state-run agricultural centers.
Mr. Arkhipov said he believes that the private farmers will eventually prevail against the collective farms, like the one in his village, where most of the cattle have been sold and fields lie fallow. But the John Deere deal, he said, prolongs the death throes a bit longer.

HEADLINE: Central Europe Is Newest Arena For Arms Race

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: BUDAPEST

 BODY:
On a hectic day in June when the Hungarian Parliament was debating a new constitution, Imre Mecs spent the morning listening to a sales pitch from the McDonnell Douglas Corporation and American military officers. As the day ended, he hurried to a party organized, he thought, by Lockheed.
It turned out that McDonnell Douglas was the host, but Mr. Mecs can be forgiven for being confused, such has been the fierce competition among American and European aerospace giants to sell advanced aircraft to former Warsaw Pact nations. 
 A McDonnell Douglas corporate jet recently flew Mr. Mecs from Washington to St. Louis. Then it was on to Fort Worth, where after a sedate dinner given by the Mayor and officials of the Lockheed Martin Corporation, the party adjourned to Billy Bob's, a famed night spot. Mr. Mecs donned a white Stetson and was photographed atop a mechanical bucking bronco, a Lockheed vice president sitting behind him.
The end of the cold war brought to a close the global arms race between the superpowers. But it has ushered in a new, equally intense rivalry among arms manufacturers bidding for their share of the world's shrinking military budgets. Central Europe, where Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are all campaigning to join NATO as soon as possible, has become a primary battleground. Together, the three countries have expressed interest in buying as much as $8 billion in advanced jet fighters.
It is a bonanza the likes of which arms manufacturers, reeling from military cutbacks from Moscow to Washington, have not seen in years, although in recent months, budgetary realities have prompted the three countries to scale back their immediate appetite for new jets.
But that has not fazed the manufacturers, who have come forward with various creative proposals to get around the lack of cash. Some are proposing cost-cutting deals under which local companies would assemble significant percentages of the planes. The United States Government is offering to lease used fighters to the countries in the hopes that this will start them down the road to equipping their air forces entirely with American-made planes.
"We're the pretty girl at the dance," said Mr. Mecs, a student leader of Hungary's 1956 anti-Communist uprising and now the congenial 62-year-old chairman of the Hungarian Parliament's defense committee. After he returned from America, Mr. Mecs raced to Stockholm, a special guest of the Swedish King at a ceremony for Saab-Scania A.B.'s Gripen combat jet. When he can find the time, Mr. Mecs will go to Paris, courtesy of the French Government and Dassault Aviation S.A., maker of the Mirage 2000.
Similar courtships are unfolding in Warsaw and Prague, where American, French and Swedish salesmen are offering deals on top-of-the-line jets.
It remains unclear whether the purchase of expensive fighters is the best use of the countries' limited military budgets. They seem more to be symbols of independence and modernity than rigorously reasoned elements of an overall defense plan.
Asked if his country really needed to buy more than a hundred sophisticated jets, Poland's Deputy Defense Minister, Andrzej Karkoszka, replied, "Can you imagine a nation of 40 million, in central Europe, without such an air force?"
The competition pits not only America against Europe, but American companies against American companies, and even the United States Air Force, which flies the F-16, against the United States Navy, which uses the F-18.
At the cocktail party here, an American admiral in a dark suit mingled with Hungarian pilots, businessmen and politicians as a member of the McDonnell Douglas delegation. Lockheed has Air Force generals on its team. Saab and Dassault can count on support from diplomats and soldiers of their countries.
The plum is Poland, which dreams of buying at least 150 fighters at a cost of nearly $6 billion. By contrast, the United Arab Emirates has opened a bidding war for an 80-jet contract. And when Thailand was in the market recently for just eight jets, the Clinton Administration was so eager for McDonnell Douglas to beat out Dassault that it reversed a longstanding policy and allowed the planes to be equipped with a highly sophisticated missile system.
In Central Europe, the race began in earnest in September when Hungary and Saab signed a tentative $1 billion agreement for 30 Gripen JAS 39's. At that time, American companies were barely at the starting line and the Clinton Administration was still debating whether to sell advanced aircraft to countries that were part of the Soviet empire.
Administration officials opposing the sale argued that such countries would be better advised to spend the money on bolstering their fragile economies. But American diplomats countered that the countries should be allowed to buy the weapons they felt they needed.
In the end, officials in Washington concluded that if the United States did not sell the jets, someone else -- the French, Swedes or the Russians with their top-of-the-line MIG-29 -- would surely do so.
About the time that the Administration was easing limits on weapons sales, officials in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic began re-thinking their enthusiasm for the expensive jet fighters.
Poland's current military budget is $3 billion, and only 10 percent of that is for hardware, said Mr. Karkoszka, the Deputy Defense Minister. If all of it were spent on planes, it would buy fewer than a dozen.
The Czech Republic, which is hoping to buy at least 24 jets, has roughly $30 million in its military budget for procurement, said Deputy Defense Minister Petr Necas. For that amount, the country can buy one F-18, and have nothing left for the radar, surface-to-air missiles and communications equipment that Mr. Necas said it needs.
In May, the Hungarian Parliament slammed on the brakes, announcing that the Government would not make a decision for another year.
With a precarious budget deficit, Hungary has been placed on a strict regime by the International Monetary Fund, which has forced severe cutbacks in social spending. "In this situation, we simply cannot afford to spend $1 billion on aircraft," Mr. Mecs said.
That has spurred the manufacturers to ever more tempting offers.
Saab, with the backing of the Swedish Government, has said Swedish companies will invest at least $100 million in Hungary to help modernize factories and provide technology. It has also said it will assemble a part of the plane in Hungary.
Officials in Poland and the Czech Republic said they were going to insist on similar terms. In recent weeks, Lockheed and McDonnell Douglas have had teams in Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic aggressively hunting for local companies in which American companies might invest.
But these deals, called offsets, can be nettlesome. A few years ago, as part of a sale of F-18's to Finland, McDonnell Douglas and its partner, the Northrop Grumman Corporation, arranged for a Finnish concern to sell machines to a Wisconsin company, which would otherwise have bought from an American company. That brought a furious protest from Senator Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, and the deal fell through.
Indeed, American officials are not even supposed to be present when offsets are discussed, since the bottom line is that jobs and exports for foreign countries are often jobs lost in America.
The Pentagon is determined, however, that American companies prevail, and it has come up with what American officials describe as a "creative option" for Central Europe -- leasing used planes. American officials said Washington had never before leased planes under such circumstances.
On strictly economic and military grounds, the Russian MIG-29 and Saab Gripen are probably best for those countries, officials in the countries said. But politics remain a big factor. Countries in the region believe the purchase of American planes will pave the way for NATO membership, even though American officials insist there is no connection. "They are not a ticket for admission," said a senior American diplomat.

HEADLINE: Storm Brews Along Shore: Amtrak Plans Alarm Boaters;
Threat of Bridge Tie-ups Could Derail an Effort To Add Faster Trains

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: NIANTIC, Conn.

 BODY:
David J. Carol likes to take his son to Dad's Restaurant on Main Street here to sit on the deck and watch the Amtrak drawbridge over the Niantic River open for sailboats and fishing boats and close for trains.
Mostly he likes to see the bridge open, and stay open. For Mr. Carol is in charge of Amtrak's plan to run high-speed trains between New York and Boston, and the final permits needed for the $1.7-billion project hinge on Amtrak's assurances that bullet trains will not interfere with boaters along the Connecticut shoreline. And what piping plovers are to beachgoers, Connecticut boaters have proved to be for Amtrak: part of the protected shoreline system. 
 The problem is not so much ecology, though there are some worries and complaints about the coming electrification of tracks.
It's the economy of the upriver marinas: at five points along less than 30 miles of shore, Amtrak drawbridges and swingbridges stand between upriver docks and open water. Thousands of vessels -- in particular, the big pleasure boats that marinas vie for -- depend on Amtrak bridge tenders to open the spans so they can pass in and out. More trains mean more closings. More closings mean fewer customers. And marinas are barred by Connecticut law from switching to a nonmaritime use, even if their business disappears.
"If they electrify, fine -- we aren't smart enough to know about electrification," said Grant Westerson, executive director of the Connecticut Marine Trades Association. "But we all know that once a train is 10 to 15 minutes out of New York, the schedule goes to hell. So our response is, be realistic. If you put on all those trains, the bridges will never be open."
Upriver marinas had already lost boats to downriver slips because of frustrating delays at the bridges, which often remained closed for long times because trains were behind schedule, or because a bridge itself broke down.
"Waterfront isn't everywhere, you can't just pack it up," said Nancy Morrissey, an association official who found in an informal survey 3,143 slips and moorings above the bridges on the Connecticut, Niantic, Thames and Mystic Rivers, valued at nearly $7 million a year in rent.
On July 3, in Providence, Amtrak had a ground breaking for the electrification project, which Rhode Island, like Massachusetts and the Federal Railroad Administration, has approved. Before work can begin in Connecticut, however, Amtrak still needs permits from the State Department of Environmental Protection, and boat traffic -- protected both by state law and by Coast Guard regulation -- remains an issue.
The result, Mr. Carol said, after two years of studying the issue with boaters, is an operating plan for the bridges that makes Connecticut "the only state in the country that has veto power over Amtrak running more trains."
According to the plan, the 34 Amtrak trains a day projected for the year 2000 -- plus 12 local commuter and freight runs -- will allow bridges to open often enough so that boats wait no more than 20 minutes, the maximum delay permitted by the Coast Guard.
If Amtrak wants more trains, it is pledging to go back to the state for approval. Amtrak is taking other actions that Mr. Carol concedes are decades overdue. The simplest change was put into effect last summer, quickly eliminating many backups: spans are now left open until a train approaches. Before, they were left closed unless a boater requested an opening.
Amtrak is also replacing a signal system so antiquated that bridge tenders operated according to train timetables. "Traditionally, they would close the bridge based on when the train was supposed to be there, rather than on where it was," Mr. Carol said. "They'd close a bridge for a train that was 35 minutes late and keep it closed for 40 minutes."
The bridge schedule is based on a survey of river traffic last summer that found plenty of time for boats that needed a bridge opening, even on the busiest holiday weekends.
Most boats do not require openings, even at the Mystic River Swing Bridge, which has a clearance of only eight feet at high tide. At the Old Lyme Draw Bridge across the Connecticut River, with a 19-foot clearance, only 387 of 1,857 watercraft passing through last Labor Day needed the span open.
That total, however, included everything from yachts to kayaks. But to marinas, big boats are more profitable, and big boats, as well as almost any sailboat, need the bridges open. "There's been a slow exodus to marinas downstream since the first time we heard of Amtrak's plans," said Scott Bowden, general manager of Port Niantic, a marina here with 81 slips and rack-storage for 104 boats. He estimated that 40 percent of his customers needed the bridge open.
"To look for smaller boats is not an appealing alternative," he said. "A 40-foot boat burns more fuel. It generally needs more repairs and maintenance. It generates more revenue not only for the marina but to the local economy."
Across the tricky Niantic Channel, where the current runs at six knots, Bill Engdall, who owns the Niantic Bay Marinas, fears a price war if larger boats start to leave, just as the industry is starting to recover from a recession in the early 1990's.
"If a lot of marinas lose those people, they may lower their rates again and we'll never get back to where we were," he said. "You're going to have marinas fighting each other over $5 or $10 a foot."
In Essex, a popular Connecticut River town where it can be easier to find a boat slip than a parking space, Wally Schieferdecker, owner of the 125-slip Essex Island Marina, said that nearly all of his customers need the Old Lyme Bridge open.
"The bridge operating plan, I believe, is Amtrak's best effort at maximizing the amount of time the bridges can be open," said Mr. Schieferdecker, who serves on an advisory board the railroad has formed with boaters. "They have also agreed to put into effect efficiencies that will improve the bridge operation. So hopefully the combination of the two will give us a decent arrangement -- if they do all those things."
For many people along the shore, however, the question of whether Amtrak can operate a railroad that will not interfere with boats leads to larger questions about the high-speed plan itself: will Amtrak be able to cut an hour off the New York-to-Boston trip, keep trains on schedule and -- its ultimate goal -- increase ridership to five million people a year from two million now.
A Stonington-based citizens group, Citizens for a Sound Environment, is challenging Amtrak's environmental-impact study in Federal court, but its main criticism is simple: the plan will not work.
"They say they're going to increase riders by reducing the time from four to five hours down to three hours," said the group's president, Jason C. Becker. "We agree that the three hours is a nicer time, but if they don't do that, if they end up closer to four hours, they've wasted a lot of money."
State Representative Robert R. Simmons, a Republican from Stonington, said he doubts whether the express trains will be able to speed their way through the dense Metro-North commuter traffic near New York.
"I tend to support trains and train travel," he said, "but at this point I think it's not going to be high speed, it's going to be high cost."
Mr. Carol acknowledges the difficulties. But the Northeast Corridor project is a pilot for all other high-speed rail plans in the country, he said, and every issue that he discovers and addresses provides a lesson for those who follow.
Amtrak, for example, now takes boaters seriously. "We've been able to impress on Amtrak and our bridge tenders that boaters have a right to get through these bridges efficiently and courteously," Mr. Carol said. "And we've told the boaters that we carry two million -- someday five million -- passengers a year, and they have a right to go over those bridges."

HEADLINE: A G.O.P. Policy Meeting May Put Pressure on Dole

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 14

 BODY:
Citing the lack of an economic message in Bob Dole's Presidential campaign, some top Republicans are planning a policy meeting in an apparent effort to spur Mr. Dole into announcing and campaigning on a platform of tax cuts.
Jack F. Kemp, the former Congressman and Housing Secretary and a sometimes-supporter of Mr. Dole, said in a television interview on Saturday that several Republican leaders, including Speaker Newt Gingrich, were planning such a meeting in two weeks. He said that they had notified officials of the Dole campaign but that those officials were not involved in planning the event or its message. Mr. Kemp implied that the meeting would go forward with or without them. 
 Interviewed on on CNN's "Inside Politics Weekend," Mr. Kemp said that without a strong message of tax cuts, Mr. Dole, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, could not win the election. Saying some Republicans, including some in the Dole campaign, were simply waiting for "the collapse of the Clinton Administration," Mr. Kemp added, "That's no way to run for President."
The Dole campaign said publicly that it welcomed the meeting as a way to find more ideas to stimulate the economy. But senior Dole advisers privately expressed frustration with Mr. Kemp for acting like what they described as a burr under Mr. Dole's saddle. One adviser said, "This freelancing proves why Jack Kemp has moved from playing quarterback for the G.O.P. to playing a new position -- left out."
Mr. Kemp, a former quarterback for the Buffalo Bills and a onetime Presidential candidate, alienated Mr. Dole earlier this year by endorsing Steve Forbes for President, even after it was clear that Mr. Dole had locked up the nomination. Although some of Mr. Dole's campaign aides are former Kemp loyalists, the endorsement made for bad blood between the two camps.
Mr. Kemp said a news conference was planned for Wednesday to announce the meeting, which will address how to "double" the rate of growth of the American economy, which he described as "anemic." He said he was planning the news conference with Mr. Gingrich; Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader; Senator Connie Mack of Florida, and others.
Mr. Kemp said Vin Weber and Donald H. Rumsfeld, both senior officials of the Dole campaign, were aware of the meeting. Mr. Weber said today that he had not been notified but that he would try to arrange his schedule to attend the announcement even without an invitation "because I know Jack wouldn't wait for one."
The Kemp-Dole relationship aside, several Republicans have been increasingly nervous about what they describe as the drift of the Dole campaign. Many have wondered privately why Mr. Dole has not been quicker to develop an economic program, emphasizing tax cuts.
Ever since Mr. Dole was challenged in the primaries by Mr. Forbes, who promoted a flat tax, he has been saying he wants a "fairer, simpler, flatter" tax system. But he has not proposed any specifics.
A former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Dole has been meeting behind the scenes for months with a group of economists. Aides said that proposals were being examined and that a consensus was being sought before any announcement, which they expect well before the Republican convention in mid-August.
"They ought to give us a little time," Mr. Weber said. "This is still midsummer. I understand every day matters, but we have plenty of time for Senator Dole to put forward a growth agenda."
Mr. Dole, who has welcomed Mr. Forbes as an economic adviser, has hinted that he will propose some form of tax relief. But he has a long history of preferring to cut the deficit to cutting taxes, and at times he has appeared to bridle at the assumption that he will abandon that stance. Mr. Kemp's remarks could be seen as a way to prod a reluctant Mr. Dole toward proposing steeper tax cuts than he might be considering.
There is a growing sense of urgency among Republicans that without a strong central economic message, Mr. Dole would continue to be swept away by controversies of his own making, on topics like tobacco and assault weapons.
Gov. George Voinovich, the Ohio Republican, told reporters at a governors' meeting in Puerto Rico that Mr. Dole was taking a meticulous approach to an economic agenda because he was committed to reconciling a tax cut with balancing the budget. Still, he said, Mr. Dole had yet to answer the fundamental question for any Presidential candidate: "Why am I running, and what am I going to do if I am President?" Mr. Voinovich added: "If he does that, he will be elected. If he doesn't he will lose. It is that simple."
Mr. Kemp said on CNN that unless Mr. Dole adopted a platform of tax cuts and made his campaign one of "hope, growth and opportunity" -- the slogan of the losing Forbes campaign -- Mr. Dole would lose.
"We've been on defense," Mr. Kemp said. "There's no doubt about it. Some Republicans believe you can win by default. People can be opposed to Bill Clinton, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're going to vote Republican unless we are the party of reform, change, progress, the future."

HEADLINE: Mayor Finds Old Issue Emerging In New Way

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 14

 BODY:
For more than two decades, Atlanta was led by civil rights giants, men not just respected but revered among blacks for their service to the movement and their barrier-breaking elections.
Maynard H. Jackson Jr., the city's first black mayor, championed the cause of affirmative action and was re-elected twice by overwhelming margins. Andrew Young, one of Martin Luther King Jr.'s top lieutenants, became Georgia's first black Congressman since Reconstruction, represented the United States at the United Nations and then followed Mr. Jackson to City Hall. 
 Now, at perhaps the most visible moment in Atlanta's history, the staging of the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, the city's leader is decidedly not one of the old warriors. At 43, Mayor Bill Campbell sees himself as the vanguard of a new generation of black leaders who embrace a less conspicuous brand of racial politics.
He has paid a political price for that approach among Atlanta's blacks, who comprise two-thirds of the city's population. But Mr. Campbell contends that much of the criticism of his 2 1/2-year tenure has less to do with substance than with the fact that "the old royal court has been deposed."
His agenda is less about the fight for black empowerment than about paving potholes, encouraging job growth, making neighborhoods safer and building downtown housing. That represents an important evolution in this city's political life, and the transition has not always been easy.
"You have to understand," he said in an interview last week, "that not being a part of the old guard or the established political structure, coming from the outside, that there are an awful lot of unhappy campers who view me as an interloper during the most important time in Atlanta's history. And they can't stand it."
Because Mr. Campbell lacks the civil rights credentials of his predecessors, even his top aides say he is still trying to get comfortable with his black constituents. A North Carolina native who moved here in 1977, Mr. Campbell has already attracted a serious challenge in next year's election from a mainstay of the old school, the City Council President, Marvin S. Arrington.
Mr. Campbell, a lawyer, is smart enough to have graduated cum laude from Vanderbilt University in three years with three majors. He is persuasive enough to have won 73 percent approval for the first city bond act passed in more than 25 years.
But the Mayor has also been accused of serious political miscalculations on racial issues.
In what came to be seen as a defining moment early in his term, he made black college students feel unwelcome with a hard-line response to an unruly, traffic-snarling spring gathering known as Freaknik. His appointment of whites to top positions, including his chief of staff, has drawn whispers of derision from black leaders.
"There's this perception that he's not black," said William H. Boone, a professor of political science at Clark Atlanta University.
On the other hand, Mr. Campbell has been a strong defender of affirmative action. But when he said at a recent rally that all black college students and business people owed their success to affirmative action, he managed to offend black and white constituents alike.
Mr. Campbell's problems with blacks have been exacerbated by a style that his critics characterize as arrogant, demeaning and vindictive.
During the interview, Mr. Campbell questioned the mental stability of one of his opponents on the City Council, C. T. Martin. "The truth of the matter is in a more humane society he would be institutionalized," Mr. Campbell said. "I think it's fair to say, you know, psychiatric intervention would be a blessing."
Mr. Martin responded, "I'm not surprised at anything Bill would say."
If Mr. Campbell's predecessors were the fathers of the civil rights movement, the Mayor was quite literally a child of it. At age 7, he was the first student to integrate a public elementary school in Raleigh, N.C. The decision was made by his father, the president of the local N.A.A.C.P., and his mother, a secretary at a black college. Mr. Campbell said he could never have imposed the same decision on his own two children. Older white students, he said, "would beat on me, spit on me, knock me down whenever there was nobody around. It is perhaps one of the great profiles in courage that my father and mother were, in essence, willing to sacrifice their 7-year-old son."
Given their parents' marching and canvassing, politics came naturally to Mr. Campbell and his older brother, Ralph Jr. Mr. Campbell won a seat on Atlanta's City Council only four years after moving to town. A year before he was elected Mayor, his brother was elected state auditor in North Carolina, making him the first black North Carolinian elected to a statewide nonjudicial office.
Being Mayor of Atlanta is not the job it once was. While its suburbs have exploded, Atlanta's population, which is estimated at about 425,000, has declined by 5 percent over the last 10 years. The Mayor now represents fewer constituents than the chief executives of four of the five counties that constitute the metropolitan area. And, to a large extent, the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, a private corporation, has served as a shadow government during Mr. Campbell's term. But as a platform for black politics, City Hall still commands national attention. And the Olympics may make the Mayor an international celebrity, at least for a few weeks.
Mr. Campbell, who was elected with 73 percent of the vote, used the Olympics and his early popularity to push through a $149 million bond act to pay for improvements to roads and bridges, win designation for the city as a Federal empowerment zone, and help his plan to build a new downtown basketball arena.
The Olympics have also provided Mr. Campbell with a moral soapbox. He has vetoed bills that would have allowed bars to serve alcohol 24 hours a day during the Games and allowed a large taxi-fare increase that he called price gouging. Mr. Young, who lobbied to bring the Games to Atlanta, said the Olympics have helped Mr. Campbell by generating civic momentum and tested him by generating scrutiny.
"I think that Bill has been luckier than most of us because he's had the Olympics to take a lot of heat and provide a lot of economic growth," Mr. Young said. "And yet he's had some major problems that he's had to deal with behind the scenes."
One problem is a sewer system so overtaxed that the state may impose a construction moratorium. And while Atlanta recorded fewer homicides last year than in any year since 1985, its crime rate rose and ranked second in the country. Last year, the police department was rocked by a big corruption scandal.
Those problems, Mr. Campbell said, will remain his priority after the Olympic glitter fades. Next year, he hopes the city's voters -- black and white -- will appreciate his delivery of services as much as they appreciated his predecessors' delivery of sermons. "For a lot of people," he said, "the allure of having an international celebrity as Mayor is special. But getting your trash picked up and having the streets patrolled is just as important."

HEADLINE: Falling Yen Puts Car Makers In Japan in the Driver's Seat

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER with ANDREW POLLACK 

 BODY:
For a decade after the dollar began its long slide in value against the yen in 1985, American auto makers and other manufacturers enjoyed a special form of protection from Japanese competitors, whose imported products became almost inexorably more expensive in the United States.
But now the sheltered years are coming to an end. 
 The dollar has soared 39 percent from its trough in April of last year. As each dollar of sales in the United States translates into more yen at home, Japanese manufacturers have found themselves in the catbird seat, with a choice of grabbing bigger profits, cutting prices to build market share or both.
What it adds up to, a growing contingent of corporate leaders and economists say, is a new competitive threat to American companies, particularly auto makers. Even if the Japanese choose to leave their prices in place and collect more profits, the extra earnings could be invested in new factories and product designs that would raise the standard of competition in the United States for years to come. If they choose to cut prices and expand their share of the American market, the resulting price wars could hurt the profits of domestic companies.
The rise brings benefits as well as perils and could prove a boon for American consumers. They could see lower prices, or at least fewer price increases. The potential for lower prices, in turn, helps hold down inflation and interest rates.
Indeed, no one is saying the dollar's rise this time will cause the kind of deep pain that accompanied its big surge in the early 1980's, when it hobbled America's exports of manufactured goods by making them more expensive. The Clinton Administration, which backs a strong dollar, says American industries are healthy enough now to shake off the effects of its current rise.
Nonetheless, problems loom for a number of American companies.
Japanese machine tool companies, for example, are beginning to bid more aggressively for overseas contracts. The Citizen Watch Company, for one, is now enjoying record sales of highly precise machine tools in the United States after lowering prices by 15 percent over the last year as the yen has dropped.
Having raised prices when the yen was rising, "we feel that we must make some kind of response to the currency shift," said Yoshikuni Ku rumato, the general manager of sales at the Okuma Corporation, another machine tool company.
Caterpillar Inc., a maker of construction equipment based in Peoria, Ill., has found that the rising dollar gives a new advantage to its archrival, Komatsu of Japan. Donald Fites, Caterpillar's chairman and chief executive, blunted the dollar's rise at least temporarily on Tuesday when he publicly suggested that Government action might be needed to reverse its ascent.
That rise -- the result of higher interest rates in the United States and a shrinking trade surplus in Japan -- has been strong and steady. Worth just 79.85 yen in April 1995, the dollar burst through the 110-yen level early this month. It closed Friday at 110.80, and was trading around 110.60 early today. While the dollar has also risen against other currencies, it has done so more slowly.
One of the industries most vulnerable to the shift with the yen is the American auto and auto parts business.
Japanese auto makers have been aggressively offering subsidized lease rates and other incentives in recent months as the yen has fallen, and are widely expected by analysts to cut some prices for the 1997 model year. Cars and car parts account for nearly one third of Japanese exports to the United States.
The average cost per vehicle sold in the United States by the top eight Japanese auto makers depends heavily on the exchange rate, said Jay N. Woodworth, a consultant in Summit, N.J., who works for Japanese and American auto makers alike.
Japanese auto makers spend an average of 1.43 million yen to manufacture a car in Japan, plus $2,600 to market and distribute the car in the United States, Mr. Woodworth said. When it took only 80 yen to buy a dollar in April 1995, the 1.43 million yen was equal to $17,875.
But now that it takes 110 yen to buy a dollar, the manufacturing cost translates to only $13,000. That is a huge savings in the auto industry, where cost-cutting is so competitive that Ford Motor Company executives were recently congratulating themselves for saving 25 cents on each Explorer by not painting the inside of the ash tray.
Even for a car assembled in the United States by Honda Motor, Toyota Motor or Nissan Motor, all of which use considerable quantities of American parts, the effect of the currency shift is considerable, Mr. Woodworth said. The savings per car as the dollar has moved from 80 to 110 yen is nearly $2,000, because many parts are still imported from Japan, he said.
Those savings are beginning to become apparent on the showroom floor. After years of rapid price increases, Japanese auto makers have raised their prices by an average of only $91 a vehicle since the beginning of the current model year, according to a recent study by Automotive News. American auto makers have raised their car and truck prices by an average of $226.
Japanese manufacturers wrung their hands with dismay when the dollar fell to 110 yen for the first time in 1993. But they have taken so many steps since then to reduce costs and become profitable at 80 or 90 yen that they now welcome an exchange rate of 110 yen.
"At 105, we still consider it a strong yen," said Ryuji Araki, a Toyota director in charge of finance and accounting, in a May interview. "Only when it's 110 or 120 will our expectations change."
Of course, American auto makers and other manufacturers have been ruthlessly driving down their own costs in recent years. Many are well prepared for another bout of tougher foreign competition. Labor costs remain lower in the United States than in Japan or Germany. And American exports rose this spring despite the dollar's strength.
All those factors are cited by executives who play down the possibility of a rerun of the early 1980's, when an overvalued dollar helped turn the Great Lakes manufacturing states into the Rust Belt, crippling exports and pulling in a flood of imports.
"It's something to watch carefully, but I don't think it's going to revert to the Rust Belt," said Gene Miller, chairman and chief executive of Comerica Bank, the biggest Michigan bank and a large lender to many Midwestern manufacturers.
The Clinton Administration has backed a strong dollar for the last two years, and dismisses new worries about its rise.
"I don't think there's any question about the health and competitiveness of our industries compared with industries all over the world," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said last Wednesday.
Earlier last week, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said that the American economy was thriving and did not need the further stimulus that a weaker dollar would provide by helping exports.
Also mitigating the effects of the dollar's rise is the fact that some American manufacturing industries are much less sensitive than others to moves in the currency markets.
Without tremendous shifts in currencies and prices, telephone companies have been slow to change suppliers of their central office switches because of the cost of retraining workers and replacing related equipment, said Chris Padilla, a vice president at Lucent Technologies Inc., formerly the manufacturing arm of AT&T.
What is more, prices for some Japanese products may not fall steeply. Most Japanese companies, including auto makers, did not raise prices in the United States in 1994 and early 1995 as fast as the yen was rising. For that reason, some American operations of Japanese auto makers have been losing money in recent years, analysts believe. That may make them eager to collect some profits for a while.
Seiichiro Iwasawa, an auto analyst at the Nomura Research Institute, said that each yen of appreciation in the dollar's value was worth about $360 million, at current exchange rates, to the Japanese auto industry. He predicted that Japanese auto makers would eventually pass along one-half to two-thirds of their savings in price reductions, while retaining the rest as higher earnings.
Detroit auto makers and their suppliers have responded by lobbying quietly for Government intervention. Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, protested the dollar's strength during a meeting early last month with senior Administration officials at the White House. Auto parts manufacturers expressed the same worry at another meeting two weeks ago.
But some American auto executives continue to take a fairly low-key approach to the yen's weakness. "If it stays between the 100 to 110 level, I don't think it's a major factor," said W. Wayne Booker, an executive vice president at Ford, who later added, "All we're really saying is that the trend is not healthy."
Yet some industry experts say even that view is unduly optimistic. "There are a lot of people in Detroit who forgot about the foreign exchange issue -- the attitude is, 'We dealt with that,' " Mr. Woodworth said. "One hundred ten is kind of an important milepost we've crossed here. The whole thing is back front and center again."
One of the first casualties of the dollar's new strength could be the slow efforts by American car companies to capture a significant share of the Japanese market. Their position in Japan is the mirror image of the Japanese position now in the United States. The Americans must choose between raising prices or accepting smaller profits as the yen they collect in Japan for new cars converts into fewer and fewer dollars.
Keith S. Wicks, the general director of Saturn Japan, rolled his eyes when asked last Monday in Tokyo how the rising dollar would affect his efforts to begin selling Saturn cars in Japan soon.
"Obviously we're hoping the dollar doesn't strengthen very much," he said. "We would like to see it down more from where it is today."

HEADLINE: Clinton Officials Back Broadcasters On Advanced TV

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
Technology advisers in the Clinton Administration have sided with broadcasters and consumer electronics makers and against major computer companies, strongly endorsing the broadcasters' preferred technology format as the standard for the next generation of television.
In letters to Reed E. Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy and a senior Commerce Department technology expert argued for quick adoption of the standard favored by the so-called "grand alliance" of broadcasters and manufacturers. It is believed to be the first time the Administration has taken a position on the proposed digital television standard. 
 In doing so, the Clinton officials have rejected the arguments of Microsoft, Apple and many other companies in the computer industry that contend that the "grand alliance" standard embraces technology that is already outdated. Government approval for that standard, they say, will inhibit innovation and drive up costs to consumers as the distinction blurs between personal computers and television sets.
The larger issue in the debate is whether a Government-endorsed technology standard will speed the development of a new industry or hurt it. On this question, the broadcasters and their allies, which have thrived under regulation, and the personal computer companies, which have thrived without it, find little common ground.
Not this year or next, but over the next decade digital television is expected to become a huge industry and transform the experience of home entertainment. Yet the often-arcane issue of technology standards will play a key role in determining the winners and losers in this industry of tomorrow, as well as what services consumers receive and at what cost.
In the two letters to Mr. Hundt, Administration officials urged the F.C.C. to approve quickly the proposed standard to aid investment in the new technology and to help American companies compete against the Europeans, who are trying to establish a competing standard for digital television.
It is the second time in the past month that Mr. Hundt has been prodded to get on with a decision affecting broadcasters. In late June, key Congressional leaders sent him a letter telling him to proceed with the allocation of those parts of the broadcast spectrum originally set aside for high-definition television broadcasts. Mr. Hundt, by contrast, had been leaning toward auctioning off those portions of the spectrum instead of giving them to broadcasters.
In the new round of prodding, Lionel Johns, associate director for technology in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, wrote the F.C.C. chairman last Wednesday: "There is an ever-diminishing 'window of opportunity' for the U.S. to define a worldwide standard. Having leapfrogged the rest of the world in the early 1990's in the race to deploy advanced television systems, America is on the brink of relinquishing its lead to international competitors."
Later in his letter, Mr. Johns dismissed the concerns of computer companies that a Government standard would stymie innovation. "In point of fact, a technological freeze will be occasioned only upon the failure to adopt a standard."
And in a letter last Thursday, Larry Irving, Assistant Secretary of Commerce in charge of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, told Mr. Hundt: "Digital television also promises myriad benefits for the U.S. economy. These benefits will accrue, however, only if the commission acts rapidly to adopt a digital television transmission standard so that the transition to digital television can begin promptly."
Companies that have worked on the standard welcomed the support. "This is very positive," said Bob Rast, vice president of technical business development for the General Instrument Corporation. "It appears that the Administration is telling Reed Hundt to get on with this."
The position of General Instrument, a pioneer in digital-television development, and other advocates is that the current proposal represents a reasonable compromise of television and computer interests. The standard is supported by the Walt Disney Company's ABC, the General Electric Company's NBC, the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's CBS, AT&T, Zenith, Philips and the communications workers' and electrical workers' unions.
But the computer companies and their supporters believe that the broadcasters and electronics makers are trying to use the Government to seize a competitive advantage in a new industry.
"Ideally, we'd like to see no standard at all," said Jack Krumholtz, Federal government affairs manager for the Microsoft Corporation. "But if there is a standard, we think it should be a minimal one to minimize the real risk of perpetuating obsolete technology."
The computer industry also believes that last week's letters from Administration officials do not necessarily represent the Clinton Administration's final position on the issue. "The public debate on this is far from over," Mr. Krumholtz said.
Technically, the debate is over the transmission technology. Today's televisions receive frames of images every 30th of a second, which are then reassembled, or "interlaced," for viewing. Computers used interlaced technology to display images and text at first, but in recent years moved to a faster, cleaner technique called "progressive scan."
Proponents of the "grand alliance" standard say their approach will make it easier for existing broadcasters to move to digital television, which offers not only sharper images but also Internet services. Computer companies reply that to receive computer-format transmissions, under the proposed standard, would require consumers to buy a costly decoding box.
Besides Microsoft, opponents of the proposed standard include Apple, Compaq, Dell, Intel, the National Cable Television Association, the Consumer Federation of America and the Directors Guild.

NEW YORK
 
When H.M.O.'s Refuse Care
Millions of New Yorkers have recently enrolled in H.M.O.'s, and most have slowly learned to navigate the system. But a growing number, mostly with chronic conditions or serious diseases, say they are being denied desperately needed care. Health experts say that many plans in New York's young and rapidly expanding managed-care industry have not developed the physician networks or the treatment programs required to handle patients with complicated medical needs. [Page A1.]
 
Renting Is Complicated, Again
Finding a rental apartment in Manhattan has become as complicated as, and in many buildings and neighborhoods even more costly than it was in the mid-to-late 1980's, when soaring rents and prices, sprouting condominium towers and co-op conversions helped define the economic boom. New York is not, by most measures, having another economic boom, and that's where this shortage gets interesting: the smoke is back, without the fire. [A1.]
 
In Albany, Success or Failure?
As the 1996 legislative year staggered to a close, Governor Pataki proclaimed that for all the record-setting delays and rancor, he still felt deeply satisfied because he and his administration had "stuck to our principles." Yet when measured by the goals and principles that Mr. Pataki articulated at the beginning of the year, 1996 might well be judged a failure for him. News analysis. [B1.]
 
After months of arguments, state lawmakers and Governor Pataki agreed on a broad array of legislation over two whirlwind weeks. [B5.]
 
A Boomlet in Clean-Burning Gas
New York City, not known as home to many an environmental movement, is riding a boomlet in vehicles that run on clean-burning compressed natural gas. Thanks to market forces and initiatives by the city, they say, New York is likely to become a center of that market. [B1.]
 
Safety Shield Proves Perilous
The anecdotal evidence is so convincing that emergency room doctors want to start keeping records, insurance premiums are going up and the relevant city commissioner says there ought to be a law. The cause of concern is the bulletproof panels behind the front seats in yellow cabs. The panels, required in most city cabs since 1994 to shield drivers from bullets and blades, are smashing the faces and breaking the noses of riders. Metro Matters by Joyce Purnick. [B1.]
 
Board Secretary Is Under Fire
With a new president at the Board of Education, the future of the board's secretary, Bruce K. Gelbard, has been cast in doubt. The president, William C. Thompson Jr., took office vowing to figure out precisely what Mr. Gelbard does. Mr. Thompson, a liberal who was elected with the Mayor's endorsement, is hoping to be the last in a long line of board officials who have tried and failed to curb Mr. Gelbard's influence. [B3.]
 
Death Spurs Interest in a Drug
Narcotics investigators say that word of a musician's death of an apparent heroin overdose has caused a strange -- but increasingly common -- ripple effect on the Lower East Side's heroin trade. Instead of being frightened by the potentially deadly effects of the powerful brand of heroin he used, known as Red Rum, drug users began seeking it out in larger numbers because of its potency, investigators said. [B3.]
 
'Subway Surfing' Death
A young man who was "subway surfing" by riding atop an elevated No. 2 train in the Bronx was killed when he hit a signal light and was hurled onto the tracks, the police said. [B3.]
 
Challenging Hempstead Voting
A class-action suit challenging the electoral system in Hempstead, L.I., is finally scheduled to go to trial in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, after eight slow years of legal maneuvering. At issue is why the town has an almost unbroken history of electing all-white Town Councils. The suit asserts that the town's at-large electoral system, in which voters choose among candidates who could come from any part of town, unfairly deprives black residents of the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. [B5.]
 
Fred Pressman Is Dead at 73
Fred Pressman, the man who transformed Barneys New York from a men's discount suit shop into a repository of cutting-edge designer fashions, died at his home in Harrison, N.Y. He was 73. The cause of death was pancreatic cancer. [B9.]
 
REGION
 
Amtrak Plan Worries Marinas
Amtrak plans to run high-speed trains between New York and Boston, and the final permits needed for the $1.7 billion project hinge on Amtrak's assurances that bullet trains will not interfere with boaters along the Connecticut shoreline. The problem is the economy of upriver marinas: at five points along less than 30 miles of shore, Amtrak drawbridges and swingbridges stand between upriver docks and open water. Thousands of vessels depend on Amtrak bridge tenders to open the spans so they can pass in and out. More trains mean more closings. More closings mean fewer customers. [B1.]

Rising Dollar Undercutting U.S. Business vs. Japanese
As the dollar slid in value against the yen during the decade beginning in 1985, American manufacturers enjoyed a special form of protection from Japanese competitors, whose products became more expensive in the United States. But as the dollar now strengthens, the sheltered years are ending. 
 The dollar has soared 39 percent in just 15 months. As each dollar of sales in the United States translates into more yen at home, Japanese manufacturers have been grabbing bigger profits, cutting prices to build market share or both. Some corporate leaders and economists say this means a new competitive threat to American companies, particularly auto makers. [Page A1.]
 
Deal Seen for King World
New World Communications Group is set to acquire King World Productions, the distributor of "The Oprah Winfrey Show," "Jeopardy" and "Wheel of Fortune," according to several people close to the talks.

Labor's New Bite
Four months before Election Day, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s ad campaign has infuriated House Republicans, forcing them on the defensive on issues like Medicare and generating a fierce counterattack.

Detroit Strike Grinds On
As the strike against Detroit's two newspapers completed its first year, striking workers had little to show for their time on the picket line. The Free Press and The Detroit News are still publishing; circulation, while down, is holding steady, and many advertisers have come back to their pages. [D9.]
 
New Markets for Arms Contractors
The close of the cold war ended the arms race between the superpowers, but ushered in an equally intense rivalry among McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed Martin and other arms manufacturers bidding for a share of the world's shrinking military budgets. [A1.]
 
A Farm Deal Helps Collectives
Critics say a deal brokered by the Clinton Administration between John Deere and Ukraine has worked against the American policy of promoting a market economy. Rather than going to private farmers, the Deere combines are being resold by a state-controlled company to collective farms and Government-run agricultural centers. [A1.]

Though far from the biggest hurricane of recent years, Hurricane Bertha was a top story for network and local newscasts and cable channels.

HEADLINE: As Market Shifts, Bad Old Days Of Finding an Apartment Return

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Finding a rental apartment in Manhattan has become as complicated as, and in many buildings and neighborhoods even more costly than, it was in the mid-to-late 1980's, when soaring rents and prices, sprouting condominium towers and co-op conversions helped define the character of an economic boom.
New York is not, by most measures, having another economic boom right now, and that's where this apartment crunch gets interesting: the smoke is back, without the fire. But this historical echo of the 1980's economy has resurrected a psychology and culture of real-estate obsession that had seemed all but extinguished. Finding a Manhattan apartment has once again become a defining New York experience. 
 "It's horrible, basically," said Ji Lu, a law student at New York University who, along with two roommates, had to sign over more than $11,000 in brokers fees and security deposits -- much of it borrowed from parents -- last week in hopes of getting a three-bedroom, $3,000-a-month apartment in Greenwich Village. And they still weren't sure, until the lease was signed and back in their hands on Friday, that they would get the apartment at all. Landlords, because they can be choosy, are setting higher credit hurdles, like financial guarantors and multi-month security deposits, for would-be tenants.
"It's been the most overwhelming experience of my life," said Ben Boyd, an account executive at Hill & Knowlton who is moving from Washington, D.C., to the company's New York office. Twice in the last month Mr. Boyd was told he had an apartment -- he had even signed a lease and given over deposit checks in one instance -- only to be told that, sorry, the apartment was gone already after all.
What has happened to the apartment market, real estate professionals, tenants and landlords say, is in many ways a mirror image of the 1980's housing crunch. Then it was a matter of too much demand as businesses expanded and hired; the tale now is of constricted supply, with not enough apartments to go around despite what is still only a shallow economic recovery from the region's deep recession in the early 1990's.
But the root of the supply constriction is also connected to what is perhaps an even more fundamental change, in who owns New York's apartments and how much they can charge in rent.
The co-op- and condo-crazed 1980's created a new class of owned housing in New York, especially in Manhattan. Of the 783,266 housing units in the borough counted by the city in a survey in 1993, just under 231,000, or about 30 percent of the total, were condos or co-ops compared with about 17.7 percent condos or co-ops for the city as a whole.
And during the recession, many of the condo and co-op owners -- institutions as well as individuals -- became members of a new landlord class, as they were forced to rent out apartments that could not be resold.
The economic recovery in the city, beginning in 1993, closed those two forces like a pincer. Some co-op and condo units that had been for rent finally began to sell to new owner-occupants -- thus shrinking the supply. And because a majority of the remaining available rental stock was still composed of co-ops and condos, which are completely beyond the rent regulation laws that cover traditional rental buildings, the shrinkage of supply drove rents as high as the market would bear.
What this means is that the free market is now setting rental rates for much of Manhattan -- a major change in itself for a city that has lived more half a century by the rhythms and rules of the rent laws. At Feathered Nest Inc., one of the city's largest rental brokers, 57 percent of the available rental stock now consists of condos and co-ops.
And all that has brought back almost-forgotten modes of behavior, as well as a cast of familiar characters.
The manipulative apartment broker with ultimate power over one's fate has made a triumphant return, for example. He has been spotted demanding that apartment-seekers spring for cab fare to travel around the city, saying he is short on cash and it will be taken out of his 15 percent broker's fee when the deal is closed. And the imperious co-op board is stirring once again as well, reasserting, in a quickened market, its power to deny admission after years of market-driven obsequiousness.
But there are some 1990's updates as well. The old 1980's ritual of combing The Village Voice classifieds on Tuesday night in preparation for Wednesday morning calls moved this spring into the realm of cyberspace. The paper's classifieds now go on line on the Internet at 1:30 P.M. on Tuesday, giving the electronically aware a crucial five- or six-hour jump on the competition. And for those planning on sharing space, a new company has popped up, supplying temporary rented walls to subdivide small spaces into even smaller ones.
The renters themselves are landing in situations that are far different from their 1980's predecessors. Like many in this new generation of renters, Mr. Boyd and his companion, Eric Fanning, have leased a co-op apartment: $1,600 a month for a one-bedroom on West 15th Street on a two-year lease. Because it's unregulated, except by the market, all bets are off when the lease expires.
"In two years we could just be out, or face some exorbitant rent increase," Mr. Boyd said.
And market-determined rates, at least in this market, only go up. At a new apartment building on Jane Street in Greenwich Village, for example, a one-bedroom that could have been rented in early June for $1,700 a month now goes for $1,850, while studios jumped from $1,200 to $1,400.
"It's the tightest it's ever been, and most of it is in the free market," said Marjorie Ann Otter, the president of Justis Properties Management Corporation, a broker in Greenwich Village. Ms. Otter said that while there are still thousands of rent-stabilized and rent-controlled apartments, fewer and fewer are becoming available. Perhaps, she said, this is because the odds of getting another regulated space are lower than they have been in recent memory, encouraging people with sure bets to become entrenched and thereby furthering the cycle of market control.
But the new rhythms and implications of this apartment crunch also extend beyond simply making life easier for landlords and harder for tenants.
Unlike the 1980's, when neighborhoods throughout much of the city experienced rising rents and real-estate prices, the mid-1990's constriction has had a sharp geographic demarcation: Manhattan only. Although rents in some tonier neighborhoods of the outer boroughs, like Brooklyn Heights and Riverdale in the Bronx, have recently begun to rise, only in Manhattan -- and only south of 96th Street at that -- has the market approached anything remotely resembling its 1980's mania.
That has made the constriction political. In their never-ending battle to convince the State Legislature in Albany that rent regulation laws should be ended, building owners are arguing that, just like the free market overhauled the national health care system despite the failure of Federal Government initiatives, so too has the apartment market in New York rendered rent regulation irrelevant and ready for retirement.
The landlords argue that rents in Manhattan are above what would be allowed by rent regulation -- so the law isn't working there -- while rents in other areas of the city are below what the regulations would allow -- and thus the rules are not working there either.
"Tenants are being protected by the market -- we can't get rents as high as rent stabilization would legally allow," said R. Bonnie Haber, the president of a small-building owner's group called Community Housing Improvement Program that has fought the rent laws, and also the president of RBH Management Corporation, a family-owned company that has 15 buildings outside central Manhattan. "It's a very distorted market."
The disparity -- and the arguments -- could be sharpened further when the biggest concentration of new housing in the region starts coming on line later this year in the Wall Street area as vacant commercial buildings are converted to residential use.
Although the conversions, encouraged by the state and city through tax breaks, would be happening even without the tight market, apartment brokers and developers said that housing pressures will make downtown grow faster and bigger than it would have otherwise. Some say that could siphon away residents from Brooklyn or Staten Island who work downtown and want to live closer to their jobs, and further weaken the outer borough housing markets where new development is just about nonexistent.
Carl Weisbrod, the president of the Alliance for Downtown, a business group that manages the area's business improvement district, said the initial estimates by the city projected that about 2,000 to 3,000 new apartments would be converted in former commercial buildings. Mr. Weisbrod now expects about 7,000 new apartments by early next century.
Higher credit and income restrictions by landlords are also increasing divisions between wealthy and less wealthy residents, and further separating Manhattan from its neighbors. Several years ago, for example, a tenant needed to earn only about three times the annual rent to qualify for a lease in Manhattan, or about $54,000 for a $1,500-a-month apartment. Now, many landlords are demanding -- because they can -- a multiple of four times the rent, or $72,000 for the same apartment.
"Landlords are able to get tenants with virtually perfect credit," said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest. It's all competition, she said: if one applicant doesn't meet the requirement, "the next one will."
The temporary wall company is also flourishing in this environment of diminished horizons. Scott Webb's two-year-old company, called The Wall (named after the Pink Floyd album, he said, in an attempt to connect with the young renters who are driving the Manhattan market) has rented about 400 to 500 walls so far. But his craft is more than just walls, Mr. Webb said: it's an act of creation and artistic expression, all in miniature. One of his proudest achievements was the creation of a two-bedroom apartment, complete with a living room, in an alcove studio apartment of only 400 square feet.
For some renters who prevail, there is often a sense of modest victory as well: that the apartment they ended up with, however small and expensive, is at least not the worst one they saw. Nearly every searcher has tales of a dead mouse, or a drunkenly sloped floor, or a dark hole that made them depressed even to see it.
Amy Appleton, a pediatrician from New Mexico who is moving to New York next month to take a job at Betances Health Unit, a medical clinic on the Lower East Side, allowed herself a five-day crash course to find an apartment, and came up, she believes, a winner.
"I've been to places that were dark and dirty and renting for more than I ended up paying," Dr. Appleton said. She leased a studio apartment in the new rental building on Jane Street. It's small for $1,445 a month, she conceded. "But it's got a view of New Jersey."

HEADLINE: New Approach Needed to U.S.-Cuba Relations

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"The Cuba Boomerang" (editorial, July 13) does a fine job of arguing that the punitive Helms-Burton law tightening the United States embargo of Cuba is a step in the wrong direction. We have seen how our families still living in Cuba suffer from a policy based on the premise that by tightening the screws on the Castro regime, that government will fall and Cuba will move toward democracy. 
 I am a Cuban-American who has over the years traveled to Cuba to visit relatives, and the effect of this policy could not be more apparent to me. Children go without milk, an epileptic aunt goes without seizure medicine, a diabetic uncle goes without sufficient insulin.
It is time for a new approach that emphasizes dialogue and negotiation. Let's do this for the vast majority of the Cuban-American community who want to see an end to the artificial separation of families.

HEADLINE: South Korea Democracy Is on a Steady Course

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "At Crossroads of Democracy, South Korea Hesitates" (news article, July 10): Although South Korea has long been a model among developing countries for economic growth, its development toward democracy has been possible only since the 1993 inauguration of President Kim Young Sam as its first civilian leader. 
 South Korea still faces problems, the biggest being the threat from North Korea. So long as that threat remains, a security law must remain in effect for national survival. Yet the Government has instituted new political financing laws, transparency in all financial transactions, ethics requirements for public officials, freely contested elections and local autonomy.
President Kim has played a leading role in advancing democracy and correcting the wrongs of history. He deserves to be commended for his contribution to Korea's democratization, which is on an irreversible course.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls vs. Yen and Mark As Stocks Lead Way Down

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar dropped to the lowest level in nearly a month against the mark and fell against most other leading currencies yesterday, dragged down as the United States stock market suffered one of its worst falls this year.
A report in Yomiuri Shimbun predicting that the Bank of Japan was preparing to raise interest rates this month also hurt the dollar. Although the central bank denied the report, traders said it helped incite a selling mood that worsened as stocks took a beating on Wall Street. 
 "I think there's a perception that the dollar has a vested interest in the health of the U.S. stock market," said Wayne Grigull, managing director of foreign exchange sales at Merrill Lynch & Company. "When it sells off as badly as it did today, it weighs on the dollar."
In late trading in New York, the dollar stood at 1.5165 marks, down from 1.5236 marks on Friday and the lowest level since June 18. The dollar fell to 110.36 Japanese yen from 110.80 yen. The British pound rose to $1.5525 from $1.5515.
The main force driving down the dollar was the drop in American stocks, led by technology issues on fears of weaker corporate earnings and higher interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average lost nearly 3 percent, or 161.05 points, its fourth-biggest point loss.
A retreat in bond prices intensified the pressure on the dollar as traders feared foreign investors would sell their dollar-denominated holdings, unleashing dollars onto the foreign exchange market.
"The dollar has behaved poorly," said Richard Alford, an economist with HSBC Midland in New York. "You have the U.S. asset markets selling off. The dollar is moving in sympathy."
The dollar's most notable decline was against the mark, but traders partly attributed that to a growing demand for marks in Europe, where speculation that German interest rates will decline has evaporated and the economy is showing signs of strength. The prospect of lower rates in Germany has weighed on the mark in recent months.
The mark's strength came despite the cancellation by President Boris N. Yeltsin of a meeting in Russia with Vice President Al Gore. Political surprises in Russia can hurt the mark because Germany is Russia's largest trading partner.

HEADLINE: A Missed Chance On Civil Rights

BYLINE: By Faye M. Anderson; Faye M. Anderson is president of the Douglass Policy Institute, an education and research group.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In spurning an invitation to address the N.A.A.C.P.'s annual convention last week, Bob Dole missed an opportunity to deliver an unfiltered message to African-American voters about his lifelong commitment to inclusion, fairness and equal opportunity for all Americans. As a policy adviser to the Dole campaign, I wish Republican strategists would stop running away from African-American voters.
I do not believe that Kweisi Mfume, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was trying to "set up" Mr. Dole, as the Republican Presidential candidate initially thought. Invitations to address the group are routinely sent to candidates in election years. 
 On the contrary, I have no doubt that Mr. Dole could have connected with the delegates of the N.A.A.C.P., which was founded by, among others, W. E. B. DuBois, a Republican. Mr. Dole could have begun with a review of the pivotal role played by many Republicans in the passage of the seminal civil rights and voting rights legislation of the 1960's.
He could have spoken about his own civil rights record, which includes staving off attempts by some in the Reagan Administration to weaken President Nixon's executive order on affirmative action and securing passage of the bill establishing a Martin Luther King Jr. national holiday. Mr. Dole also supported the 1991 Civil Rights Act, which strengthened remedies for past discrimination.
He also could have talked about the meetings he held, starting in 1993, with Republican senators and African-American public policy experts to develop what his staff called a new "paradigm" for civil rights -- one that embraces issues like crime prevention, quality education and repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act, a legacy of the Jim Crow era. (The act requires contractors to pay "prevailing wages" on Federal construction projects, to the detriment of nonunion -- especially minority -- businesses.)
Mr. Dole could have set the record straight on the Equal Opportunity Act of 1995, which he introduced before leaving the Senate. The bill ended racial and sex preferences in Federal programs, but it also mandated vigorous enforcement of nondiscrimination laws and allowed private sector initiatives to recruit more minorities and women. (Congress has since scuttled the bill.)
In addition, at a time when Federal coffers are too depleted to help rebuild crumbling inner-city schools, Mr. Dole could have used the N.A.A.C.P. forum to state his opposition to a new form of corporate welfare: the giveaway of second, "transitional channels" to broadcasters rushing to switch to digital TV transmission. He could have called on his erstwhile Congressional colleagues to rescind their directive to give away these channel frequencies, whose worth at auction could reach $100 billion by some estimates. He could have shared his own notion: that public resources like airwaves should not be at the service of special interests.
That's some of what Mr. Dole could have said. He should now make it clear to the "blue suits" at campaign headquarters who apparently dismissed the N.A.A.C.P. invitation that one does not add to the party's base by subtracting. He should ask what objective was served by a decision that was certain to alienate African-American voters further and generate negative press coverage.
The blue suits, meanwhile, should consider this: The black voting-age population in the 13 must-win Southern states ranges from 11 percent in Florida to 32 percent in Mississippi, with most states in the more than 20 percent range. In Midwestern swing states, the black electorate is about 10 percent, large enough to determine the outcome of a close election.
Finally, Mr. Dole should find another way to speak directly to African-Americans about their concerns -- about economic security, safe streets and whether their children will be able to compete in the global economy. If campaign headquarters needs assistance in identifying an appropriate forum, well, I'm listed.

HEADLINE: Bosnia Election Campaign Postponed Over Karadzic Issue

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, July 15

 BODY:
The Western diplomat in charge of overseeing the coming Bosnian elections today postponed the start of the campaign until Friday, to give the Bosnian Serbs a few more days to oust their political leader, Radovan Karadzic.
Robert H. Frowick, a retired American diplomat who is head of the Bosnia operation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, said "it is my unalterable position" that any political party with officers that have been indicted on war crimes charges cannot participate in the elections. 
 The only party in that category is Dr. Karadzic's Serbian Democratic Party, which is about the only organized Bosnian Serb party with any significant following. Dr. Karadzic, who has been indicted by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, has said he will not run as a candidate in the national elections scheduled for Sept. 14 -- something that would not be allowed in any case under the Dayton peace accords -- but he was recently re-elected as head of his party and continues to control the police and politics in the Serb-held part of Bosnia.
Mr. Frowick's move is the latest "ratcheting up," as officials here put it, of the diplomatic pressure on Mr. Karadzic to give up his political positions, if not turn himself in to the war crimes tribunal for trial.
On Tuesday, Richard C. Holbrooke, the American diplomat who pushed through the peace agreement last fall, is to arrive in the region and will try to pull off another coup: convincing the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, that he must muscle Dr. Karadzic out, something no one so far has been able to persuade Mr. Milosevic to do. Mr. Holbrooke has left the Government but was specially recalled for the trip.
Beneath the public maneuvering, however, there is widespread pessimism after six months of trying to oust Dr. Karadzic that any political solution is attainable, and a growing belief that only military action will remove him from the scene.
At a news conference here on Sunday, France's Defense Minister, Charles Milion, said France planned to ask the United Nations Security Council to give the NATO forces in Bosnia a clearer mandate to arrest those indicted on charges of war crimes. But any joint action by NATO troops would require the assent of NATO's governing body, which many diplomats say is unlikely.
Under current orders, set by the United States and European powers in NATO, the forces in Bosnia are to arrest indicted war crimes suspects if they encounter them. But they are not supposed to seek them out, and military officers in the country say they fear that any action against Dr. Karadzic or Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military leader who is also under international indictment, would provoke deadly retaliation.
While France is now the first major power to openly discuss the possibility of a military operation, there is no public indication that the French would be willing to act on their own.
Britain, which has been strongly opposed to a military action, is "rethinking," a senior European diplomat said. And Carl Bildt, the principal international negotiator in Bosnia, has also recently come to the conclusion that a "military snatch" of Mr. Karadzic is necessary, an official close to him said.
The Clinton Administration is divided on the issue. Some officials in the State Department strongly favor a military action, several American officials said in recent days. The Pentagon has said it is against such an operation because it would put American troops at risk.
But a few days ago, the commander of American forces in Bosnia, Gen. William L. Nash, in a meeting with Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor, said his troops had the ability to do the job.
"Give us the order, and we'll do it," General Nash said, according to people who were present.
Most important, President Clinton and White House officials, with an American presidential election coming in November, strongly want to avoid American casualties or a wholesale unraveling of the Bosnian peace effort -- clear risks of a military action.
Underscoring the potential risks, the police chief in Pale, the capital of the Bosnian Serb republic, has threatened wide reprisals against NATO troops and the United Nations police if there is an attempt to arrest Dr. Karadzic, a United Nations spokesman, Alex Ivanko, said here today.
Many diplomats are skeptical that the latest diplomatic efforts will succeed in removing Mr. Karadzic, because the weapons that the outside powers have -- or are willing to deploy -- do not match their polemics against Dr. Karadzic. Western countries have not shown the unanimity that would be required to reimpose stiff economic sanctions, for instance.
A senior European diplomat said he thought that Mr. Milosevic was "immune" to any pressure Mr. Holbrooke might bring.
If the West reimposes sanctions, Mr. Milosevic is likely to counter by withdrawing his support for the Dayton peace plan, this diplomat said.
In any event, the Clinton Administration is alone in favoring the reimposition of sanctions.
The so-called contact group on Bosnia is also divided over what to do about the elections. At the London meeting last week, only the United States and Germany backed the proposal of Mr. Frowick to keep the Serbian Democratic Party out of the election if Dr. Karadzic is still around. France had reservations, and the British even stronger ones, but they promised to keep them quiet, American and European diplomats said. The other member of the group, Russia, was largely quiet at the meeting but has previously said no new actions against Dr. Karadzic were necessary.
The British said an election with Dr. Karadzic still in power would be better than disqualifying his party because that would alienate most Serbs.
Asked if he thought the new diplomatic efforts to oust Dr. Karadzic would work, a Western diplomat said: "I don't, and I don't know who does. But Holbrooke has pulled some things out before that nobody ever, ever thought possible."

HEADLINE: Lester Robbins, 90, Who Built Row Houses for Public Housing

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Lester Robbins, a developer of tract housing in the United States after World War II who became a moving force in Brooklyn's highly praised Nehemiah Plan of the 1980's, died on Sunday at his home on Manhattan's Upper East Side. He was 90 and also lived in East Hampton, L.I., and Lantana, Fla.
One of the first builders of tract homes in New Jersey, Mr. Robbins also developed millions of square feet of industrial and commercial property around the country. His organization continues as the Robbins Agency of Union, N.J., which manages far-flung housing projects, shopping centers and office space. 
 In the Old Testament, the King of Persia sent Nehemiah to Jerusalem to rebuild it after the Baylonian Captivity, a tale that fired the imagination of Roman Catholic and Protestant church leaders in East Brooklyn as they contemplated blocks upon blocks of derelict, burned-out housing in Brownsville.
They banded together to raise financing and produce shelter in an area with a large black and Hispanic population and huge tracts of idle city-held land. The idea behind the Nehemiah Plan was that of I. D. Robbins, Lester Robbins's cousin, a civic-minded construction executive who died earlier this month.
He supervised the project and Lester Robbins was the builder. By then, in the 1980's, he had created more than 6,000 single-family homes in New York and New Jersey during 40 years.
The moving force behind the plan was the failure of many large postwar public-housing projects built in the inner cities for urban renewal. Instead, the vision was for affordable, low-density row houses, one to a family. Mr. Robbins finished 1,200 of them in the 1980's.
Born in St. Louis, the son of a dress manufacturer, he was brought to New York City at age 3. He received varsity letters in lacrosse and and football at Cornell, graduating in 1927 as a chemical engineering major.
He worked as a button jobber and helped his father build a sand-lime brick factory, the only experience in construction he brought to his first project. It was a 20-unit four-story walkup in Elmhurst, Queens, in 1936.
Small projects of that sort made for the experience he needed to bid on government housing for workers in war production, just when regular home building ground to a halt because of the draft and a shortage of materials. Mr. Robbins built hundreds of units in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and on Governors Island in New York Harbor.
After the war, he was ready for the building boom caused by returning veterans. He specialized in large-scale production of single-family dwellings and moderately priced garden apartments. He also gradually expanded Robbins Construction into housing for the elderly in New Jersey and commercial and industrial undertakings across the country.
As a philanthropist, he provided college scholarships for dozens of young people. Among his other beneficiaries were the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington and Thanks to Scandinavia, an American-supported organization honoring Scandinavian efforts to save Jews from the Holocaust in World War II.
Mr. Robbins is survived by his wife of 27 years, Sheila Johnson Robbins; two daughters, Marjorie Friedlander of Los Angeles and Ann Aknin of Dana Point, Calif.; two sons, David of Princeton, N.J., and Peter of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Barbara Morgan of Parlin, N.J., and Meredith Hardy of Mercer Island, Wash.; a stepson, Thomas Hardy of Bethesda, Md., and a sister, Lucille Gruen of Delray Beach, Fla.; 10 grandchildren, 15 stepgrandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren, and 5 stepgreat-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Business Inventories Drop And Growth in Sales Eases

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Business inventories fell in May even as companies reported a slowdown in sales growth for the month, Government figures showed today.
Business inventories decreased one-tenth of 1 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted $983.254 billion after rising four-tenths of 1 percent in April, the Commerce Department said. Business sales rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in May after rising a revised 1.1 percent in April. 
 The inventory-to-sales ratio, an indicator of how long it would take to sell the supply of goods available at the current pace, fell to 1.37 months' worth in May, its third consecutive monthly decline and the lowest level since the Government began keeping records in 1982.
While that suggests the economy should get a lift in the third quarter as business managers replenish stocks, many economists doubted that the inventory-buying would be large enough to have much of an effect on growth.
"Any buildup will be slow and cautious," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. "They certainly don't want to repeat their 1995 experience, ending up with too much inventories."
A modest inventory accumulation would allay fears at the Federal Reserve that inflation is ready to erupt on the thrust of robust second-quarter growth. Analysts say the economy expanded at a 4 percent annual rate, or faster, in the April-June quarter, or nearly double the pace that the Fed sees as noninflationary.
Most economists, however, including those at the central bank, are forecasting slower growth in this year's second half.
The recent slowing of the growth in sales volume is evidence that the surge in economic growth during the spring "was a short-term phenomenon," said Erin Fossett, an economist with First Chicago NBD. "We're already seeing signs of things starting to slow down again."
Overall retail sales unexpectedly fell last month to their lowest level in almost a year, including a drop in sales in the interest-sensitive auto industry. And auto inventories rose two-tenths of 1 percent in May.
Corporate earnings reports have been disappointing as well, depressing the stock markets recently.
"All these things would indicate finally, finally the economic slowdown we've been all waiting for quite some time is beginning to unfold before us," Mr. Sohn of Norwest said. "In the third quarter we will see consumers spending less, and businesses probably not building much inventory at all."
By industry, inventories at retailers increased less than one-tenth of 1 percent in May. Inventories at wholesalers, which make up about one-fourth of the report, fell two-tenths of 1 percent during the month, and factory inventories, which account for almost half of the report, were down two-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Prices for Treasuries Slip, Falling Late in the Session

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell yesterday for the first time in more than a week.
Some traders expected a slumping stock market to add weight to a perception that the economy is running out of steam. Bonds fell late in the day when a rout in stocks temporarily abated, traders said. 
 "If you were in the bond market because stocks were weak, stocks weren't weakening much further and it wasn't benefitting bonds much," said Tony Crescenzi, head of fixed-income trading at the Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Company "You had less reason to hang on."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 14/32, to 86 21/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 7.07 percent, from 7.03 percent on Friday.
Concern that the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, will hint in Congressional testimony this week that there is reason to raise interest rates may have encouraged some bond investors to sell, Todd Speiser, a trader at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company in New York, said.
"Stocks have fallen appreciably in the last week or so, and supposedly some decent-sized investors bought bonds and sold stocks," Mr. Speiser said. "They may not want to ride it through" Mr. Greenspan's remarks, which could suggest the central bank is about to raise interest rates.
Even so, some investors and analysts say a worse threat for bonds would be an indecisive Fed that holds off raising rates to keep stocks from falling further.
"With economic reports continuing to come out on the strong side, they run the risk of being viewed by the markets as doing too little too late," said Anthony Karydakis, chief financial economist at First Chicago Capital Markets.
Traders and investors will gain more insight into the pace of inflation from the Labor Department's report today on June consumer prices. A survey of analysts said that the index probably climbed two-tenths of 1 percent, or three-tenths of 1 percent excluding the volatile food and energy sectors.
In yesterday's regular weekly auction, the Treasury sold $14.2 billion in new three-month bills and $14 billion in new six-month bills.
The average discount rate on the three-month bill was 5.19 percent, down from 5.21 percent last week, while the rate on the six-month bill was 5.36 percent, down from 5.41 percent.
In the corporate bond market, Lucent Technologies Inc. plans to sell $750 million each of 5- and 10-year notes this week to help pay off short-term debt it inherited when it separated from the AT&T Corporation earlier this year. The notes will be rated A2 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the municipal bond market, New York postponed the sale of $76 million in bonds after lawmakers ratified the state's $66 billion budget, more than three months beyond its April 1 deadline.
Wall Street's credit-rating companies said the budget process, along with a dependence on about $500 million in one-time revenue measures could hurt New York's rating. Standard & Poor's may revise its outlook on the state's debt to stable from positive, reflecting the delay.
Following are yesterday's results of the Treasury's regular weekly auction of three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.688	97.290	Discounted Rate	5.19%	5.36%	Coupon Yield	5.33%	5.59%	High Price	98.693	97.295	Discounted Rate	5.17%	5.35%	Coupon Yield	5.31%	5.58%	Low Price	98.686	97.285	Discounted Rate	5.20%	5.37%	Coupon Yield	5.34%	5.60%	Accepted at low price	6%	5%	Total applied for	$54,876,271	$51,711,078	Accepted	$14,169,071	$14,030,028	Noncompetitive	$1,468,064	$1,540,364

HEADLINE: Tomorrow, the World Wide Web!;
Microsoft, the PC King, Wants to Reign Over the Internet

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
As a captain of industry and the richest man in America, William H. Gates has often been compared to industrial titans of the past.
And just as the railroad tycoons of the 1800's set the gauge for the nation's railroad tracks, Mr. Gates's Microsoft Corporation seems intent, its critics say, on the modern-day equivalent: controlling many of the basic technical specifications of the global Internet. 
 The result could be a rapid end to the furious pace of entrepreneurial innovation that has marked the Internet in recent years, critics say, just as hegemony of Microsoft's Windows software has often been blamed for limiting technical innovation in personal computing.
Lately, there has been much publicity for Microsoft's new-found focus on the Internet, starting with a celebrated speech last December in which Mr. Gates said his company would cooperatively "embrace and extend" industrywide Internet technical standards. The public spotlight has focused on new software features and product release dates, as the company tries to catch up with Internet leaders -- like the Netscape Communications Corporation, maker of the Navigator browser for the World Wide Web, and Sun Microsystems Inc., whose Java software is designed to move computing power onto the network from the desktop -- that have been seen as the biggest threat in years to Microsoft.
But while these well-chronicled contests continue, far more meaningful skirmishes are occurring among little-known industry groups that set the arcane -- but crucial -- technical specifications that determine whether and how well various makes and models of hardware and software can work together on the Internet.
On this front, Microsoft may be in the best position to use its market power to influence technology's future. And it is a measure of Microsoft's intensity that one of these struggles has even placed the company at odds with its symbiotic hardware partner, the Intel Corporation.
Rather than merely embrace and extend the Internet, the company's critics now fear, Microsoft intends to engulf it.
Microsoft executives insist that the company intends to cooperate with Internet standards groups. But according to industry executives who have observed Microsoft's activities in these standards sessions, there is evidence that the company is attempting to employ the same sort of business practices that helped it rise to dominance in the personal computing industry -- and that have repeatedly drawn the scrutiny of Federal antitrust investigators.
Just as Microsoft did with PC technology, these executives fear, the company intends to subsume more and more of the Internet's basic technology in Windows.
Indeed, even while it works behind the scenes to shape future technical standards to its competitive advantage, Microsoft has begun to absorb into Windows various Internet capabilities -- like the company's Explorer browser for the World Wide Web and Front Page set of tools for creating Web pages. By offering such products as part of Windows, critics contend, Microsoft could wage an Internet war of attrition against rivals large and small -- whether ascendant powers like Netscape or established tool makers like Adobe Systems Inc., producer of Web-page designing software called Pagemill.
"There are societal consequences to Microsoft's strategy," said Gary Reback, a Silicon Valley lawyer who has battled Microsoft in court and before the Justice Department in recent years on behalf of a number of its competitors. "Here is a new technology and a whole new wave of commerce, and Microsoft wants to suck it in to the operating system to maintain its monopoly."
Microsoft insists that using the Windows vacuum cleaner as a way to suck away revenue from competitors is simply good business.
"Yes, that is our business strategy," said Paul Maritz, the executive vice president for the company's Internet business. "But not out of spite. What you're seeing here is competition, which is good and healthy. Now we have Netscape's Navigator and Sun's Javasoft as our new competitors."
Mr. Reback, though, has been trying to raise alarms with the Justice Department, which last year was intensely investigating the potential antitrust implications of Microsoft's placing an icon for its on-line Microsoft Network on the main screen of Windows 95.
Justice officials decline to comment, but as Microsoft has turned its focus from subscriber-based on-line services to the more open Internet and World Wide Web, the antitrust investigation has reportedly become moribund -- though it is not officially closed.
Not all legal experts, however, see an antitrust threat in Microsoft's Internet activities.
"Maybe it's not a polite way of doing business, but it's not Microsoft's responsibility to be polite," said William F. Baxter, a Stanford law professor who headed the Justice Department's antitrust division for three years in the Reagan Administration.
Still, many companies have grown wary of Microsoft's intentions since it set its sites on the Internet.
On Dec. 7, the same day that Mr. Gates was delivering his embrace and extend" speech at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Wash., a small group of software developers from Intel was meeting in Silicon Valley with Microsoft counterparts. The group was trying to hammer out details of a new technical standard designed to improve and streamline all aspects of computer security and privacy on the Internet, regardless of the brand of hardware or software used.
For five months, Intel had been quietly orchestrating this effort, which had the preliminary support of a group of influential companies that included Netscape and Sun Microsystems. Apple Computer Inc. was also considering coming aboard. But while Microsoft's commitment looked increasingly likely, it was still not certain.
Intel executives were encouraged by the Dec. 7 meeting, however, and they came away hoping to deliver a finished set of specifications at an industry technical conference the next month.
Only a week before the planned announcement, however, Microsoft shocked Intel: not only did the company abruptly pull out of the consortium -- it also said it planned to work against the group's efforts.
Intel executives decline to discuss the matter. But according to several people familiar with the meetings, Microsoft's rapidly evolving Internet strategy now regarded the specifications backed by Intel as a subset of the computer operating system. And the operating system, came the word from Redmond, was something that Microsoft "owned."
The tentative coalition became undone. Without Microsoft's support, the other members drifted away to try their luck with other Internet standards-setting groups. And while Intel would subsequently publish its security plan, the Common Data Security Architecture, on its corporate Web site (http://www.intel.com/iaweb/security/), today it goes largely unread, like a fading billboard on a side road nobody travels any more.
Significantly, late last month Microsoft posted its own version of a very similar document, called the Microsoft Internet Security Framework, on the company's Web site (http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/security/swpintro.htm), as early notification of the security and privacy specifications the company intends to place in future versions of Windows.
Microsoft executives insist that there was nothing duplicitous in the company's withdrawal from the Intel consortium. The company simply concluded that it would be better to pursue standards-setting within the established Internet committees, rather than ad hoc groups like Intel's, Mr. Maritz said.
"The bottom line on this is we decided to work through the Internet Engineering Task Force and World Wide Web Consortium," he said, referring to established Internet standards organizations.
Microsoft is still getting acculturated to these technical circles, which continue to reflect the Internet's roots in the computer-hacker culture of the 1960's and 70's that was based on an ethic of freely shared work.
"The jury is still out on Microsoft's intentions," said Jeffrey Schiller, a computer security expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who is chairman of the Internet Engineering Taskforce's working group on security issues.
But old habits, apparently, die hard. In a separate Internet standards forum, Microsoft earlier this year proposed a proprietary technology the company called Active V.R.M.L., or Virtual Reality Markup Language, to a small Internet group that is setting specifications for virtual reality systems on the Internet.
Mark Pesce, a San Francisco-based computer researcher who was co-inventor of the original version of V.R.M.L. technology, recalled that during the standards meetings Microsoft executives did not appear to be willing to compromise on technology ideas.
"Microsoft was not interested in half and half," Mr. Pesce said. "It was their way or else."
In May, the V.R.M.L. standards committee rejected the Microsoft proposal. But industry executives say the company is now trying to reposition Active V.R.M.L. as a technology for viewing multimedia images on the Web -- an approach that would compete head on with an increasingly popular technology called Shockwave, from Macromedia Inc., a leader in software tools used by multimedia developers.
Microsoft says it is just reacting to a competitive threat. But some legal experts say that if the company's activities have ever warranted Federal antitrust scrutiny, its rapid assault on the Internet would seem to raise many of the same questions.
"The hurdle the Government will have to get over is today they see Netscape with a commanding lead and all the hype around the growth of the Internet," said Garth Saloner, an economist at the Stanford Business School. "What will happen when they see that six or nine months down the road they've been run over, and at that point it is too late?"


GRAPHIC: For years, Microsoft has been able to pressure competitors and control the technical direction of the personal computer world by sucking key technologies into its Windows operating system, the software that runs more than 80 percent of the world's PC's. Now, critics say, Microsoft seems intent on aiming the same strategy at the Internet.
 
WHAT WINDOWS HAS ABSORBED . . .
Chart: "Clean Sweep"
 OFFICE NETWORKING (1992) -- Windows for Workgroups duplicated most capabilities that were the core of Artisoft's Lantastic and Novell's Netware Lite.
 MEMORY MANAGEMENT (1993) -- The improved PC memory management in Windows 3.11 erodes the market for Quarterdeck's QEMM product.
 DISK COMPRESSION (1993) -- Doubled the storage space on a PC disk and obviated users' need for Stac Electronics' Double Space.
 FAX SOFTWARE (1993) -- Adding fax features to Windows impinged on Delrina's Winfax software business.
 COMMUNICATIONS ( 1995) -- E-mail in Windows 95 put pressure on products like Lotus' cc.mail.
 
. . . AND WHAT MAY BE NEXT
 WEB BROWSER -- Microsoft is rolling Explorer into Windows 95, hoping for an edge on Netscape's Navigator.
 WEB DESIGNING -- Adding Front Page, a tool for Web-site authors, to Windows will threaten products like Adobe Systems' Pagemill.
 GROUPWARE -- Net Meeting, which allows people to work collaboratively over a network as with Lotus Notes, will become a Windows feature later this year.
 WEB SERVER -- The new Internet Information Server in Windows NT competes head on with Website from O'Reilly & Associates.

HEADLINE: Despite Solid Profit Reports, Banking Stocks Edge Lower

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Nationsbank Corporation and other large banking companies reported solid gains in second-quarter earnings yesterday, meeting or beating expectations on Wall Street, but their stock prices edged lower on worries that rising interest rates would hurt profits down the road.
Nationsbank, the fifth-largest bank in the United States, said earnings grew 30 percent in the quarter. The First Chicago NBD Corporation said profits rose 9 percent, and the PNC Bank Corporation reported a 28 percent jump in earnings. 
 The companies cited strong loan growth, tight expense controls and acquisitions.
Nationsbank, based in Charlotte, N.C., said earnings grew to $605 million, or $2 a share, in the quarter, which ended on June 30, from $467 million, or $1.71 a share, in the comparable period last year. The earnings exceeded analysts' estimates of $1.96 a share, according to First Call, which tracks earnings forecasts.
The company cited strong growth in consumer loans and higher fees for mortgage servicing and investment banking.
First Chicago NBD said earnings rose to $361 million, or $1.10 a share, in the quarter from $331 million, or 99 cents a share, in the comparable quarter last year.
The company, based in Chicago, said interest income grew 16 percent, bolstered by growth in the credit card and regional banking businesses. Noninterest expense fell nearly 1 percent in the quarter.
First Chicago acquired NBD Bancorp of Detroit for about $5.1 billion in one of many large mergers in the industry last year.
PNC Bank said earnings rose to $248.1 million, or 72 cents a share, in the quarter, from $194 million, or 56 cents a share, last year.
Revenues rose on growth in asset management, brokerage and corporate finance businesses, PNC's chief executive, Thomas H. O'Brien, said in a statement.
The company, based in Pittsburgh, said loan growth and the acquisition of the New Jersey operations of Chemical Bank last year increased interest income. PNC Bank also acquired the Midlantic Corporation of Edison, N.J., late last year.
While the earnings generally met or surpassed expectations, investors have grown nervous because an increase in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve would raise the cost of funds for banks and make borrowers more tight-fisted, hurting bank profits.
A surprisingly strong June employment report early this month convinced some investors the Fed would raise short-term rates by the end of August to keep a lid on inflation.
After the employment report, Merrill Lynch & Company lowered its ratings on several banking companies, sending their stocks sharply lower last week.
Indeed, bank stocks fell yesterday, amid a broad market selloff. Shares of Nationsbank dropped $1, to $79.25; shares of First Chicago slid $1, to $38.125, and PNC shares fell 75 cents, to $28.75.
But not all analysts agree that higher rates will hurt bank earnings. Some said higher rates should not be a concern for many banks and that some regional banks would even prosper, because loan demand was likely to remain brisk.
Among other smaller banking companies reporting earnings, Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. of St. Louis said earnings grew 14 percent, to $146 million, or 92 cents a share, from $128 million, or 80 cents a share, in the comparable 1995 quarter.
"Consistent revenue growth and effective expense control have allowed us to generate attractive year-to-year earnings increases," Andrew Craig 3d, the company's chairman, said in a statement.
Analysts had expected Boatmen's to earn about 91 cents a share in the quarter, according to First Call.
The Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis said earnings rose 22 percent in the quarter, to $285.4 million, or 76 cents a share, from $234.3 million, or 68 cents, last year. The results, which matched Wall Street's expectations, were bolstered by increased fees from its lending business, the company said.

HEADLINE: Pataki Allies To Give Data On Donations

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 15

 BODY:
A State Supreme Court justice today ordered fund-raisers for Gov. George E. Pataki's inauguration and transition to release their financial records, and after 18 months of resisting such demands, the Governor's supporters said they would comply within 40 days.
The Governor, through his aides, initially promised to make the records public when the two funds were established in late 1994 to finance his elaborate inauguration and transition. But the Pataki administration later reversed itself, and the officials who managed the two funds waged a court battle to block efforts by the Democratic-led Assembly to subpoena the records. 
 Today, Justice Joseph Harris in Albany ruled that the Assembly was within its rights to issue the subpoenas and ordered the two funds to release the names of contributors and the amounts of their contributions, as well as information about how the money was spent. Administration officials have said the funds raised $1 million, but the Democrats contend that the total was closer to $1.4 million.
The release of the records is expected to help answer some of the questions Democrats have raised, including these:
Who were the major contributors and did they receive preferential treatment from the administration? How much off-the-books money was taken from the funds and given to senior administration officials for their work on the inauguration and during the transition? Was there any surplus after expenses were paid, and was any of it used for political purposes, like paying off the Governor's campaign debts?
When Mr. Pataki's aides formed the two corporations that managed the transition and inauguration funds shortly after his election, they promised to voluntarily abide by state election laws that limit the size of donations and require detailed public disclosure about contributions and expenses.
But an inquiry by The New York Times in November showed that many lobbyists and corporations that are regulated by the state contributed to the funds, some of them giving more than what would be allowed under state campaign finance laws. When asked for the funds' financial records, Mr. Pataki's aides and the funds' officials refused.
The Assembly Democrats, who began investigating the funds in December, have contended that the corporations may have spent only half of their money on the inauguration and transition and used some of the rest to pay off Mr. Pataki's campaign debts. Mr. Pataki has denied that any money was used for campaign debts, which would violate campaign finance laws.
The Assembly Democrats said they planned to use the financial records as the basis for public hearings into the funds' activities, possibly during the fall elections. The Democrats are developing legislation that would restrict the activities of private corporations that raise money for elected officials' inaugurations and transitions.
The Democrats called Justice Harris's decision a clear victory, saying it had pried open the activities of two corporations that may have conducted secret political work for Republicans.
"The issue has always been who contributes and how was the money spent," said Assemblyman Paul A. Tokasz, a Buffalo-area Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Election Law Committee. "This will help the Election Law Committee determine whether inaugurals and transitions should be governed by the election law."
But the Governor's aides and lawyers for the inaugural and transition funds also claimed victory, saying that Justice Harris's ruling did not require the funds to release all of their internal documents, including things like contracts, as the Assembly had demanded.
They also noted that the ruling did not allow the Assembly to force the funds' officers to testify at public hearings. One of the people subpoenaed by the Assembly to testify was Charles A. Gargano, who was chairman of Mr. Pataki's inaugural committee and is now state Commissioner of Economic Development.
In his decision, Justice Harris, a Democrat, wrote that it was legitimate for the Assembly to investigate the "political impact" of the two funds. But he said that the demands for records were too broad and would breach the funds' right to privacy. The funds were established as private, for-profit corporations.
The decision, he wrote, provides a balance that "allows the Legislature to fulfill its proper role without permitting an unnecessary political feeding frenzy."
H. Neal Conolly, the lawyer for Mr. Gargano and for Lawrence Kalkstein, who was an official of the corporations and holds their records, said that Mr. Kalkstein did not want to continue a court fight that could further embarrass the Governor.
Mr. Conolly said that Mr. Kalkstein, an accountant who worked on Mr. Pataki's campaign, decided not to appeal the judge's ruling, and that the Governor's office was not involved in the decision.
"It was the decision of our client that we had made our point, and in the end we are hurting the administration by not releasing the information," Mr. Conolly said.
Zenia Mucha, Mr. Pataki's director of communications, said the Governor supported the decision not to appeal. "The judge said what we had said, which is that this is a political witch hunt," she maintained.

HEADLINE: Dole's Sagging Campaign Affects G.O.P. Morale, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
Former Senator Bob Dole's Presidential campaign has stumbled so badly that 7 in 10 Americans -- and nearly half of those who say they plan to vote for Mr. Dole in November -- expect him to lose to President Clinton.
That is one of the more intriguing findings of a new New York Times/CBS News Poll, taken last Thursday, Friday and Saturday. It suggests that Mr. Dole's persistent troubles are beginning to affect morale in his party. A total of 979 people, 743 of them registered voters, were interviewed for the survey, which had a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. 
 If large numbers of Republicans become convinced that Mr. Dole has no chance, many might stay home, hurting the party's chances in contests for the House and Senate.
As it is, the poll showed, 44 percent of all voters would choose a Democratic candidate if the election were held now, compared with 41 percent who would choose a Republican. That indicates a close contest for control of the House, which the Republicans seized in the 1994 off-year elections.
The poll had almost nothing but good news for Mr. Clinton. It showed him running 20 percentage points ahead of Mr. Dole, 54 to 34, in a two-way race, and 22 percentage points ahead of the Republican when Ross Perot was included as the nominee of his Reform Party. The figures in the latter case were 49 percent for the President, 27 percent for Mr. Dole and 16 percent for Mr. Perot.
Mr. Perot took 19 percent of the vote four years ago. He has been relatively inactive lately, until his semiannouncement last week, but it appears that he is within striking distance of his old level of support.
In the same week the poll was being taken, Richard D. Lamm, the former Governor of Colorado, said he would seek the Reform Party nomination. If Mr. Lamm beat Mr. Perot, which is considered highly unlikely, the poll indicated that he would hurt Mr. Clinton more than Mr. Dole. With Mr. Lamm, a Democrat, in the race, the figures were 49 percent for the President, 34 percent for Mr. Dole and 5 percent for Mr. Lamm.
For the first time since he took office, Mr. Clinton's handling of the economy was rated favorably by more than half of the public; 51 percent said they approved of his performance in this area, a crucial element in Presidential elections in the past, and 38 percent said they disapproved, with 11 percent expressing no view.
However, more people said the economy was getting worse (27 percent) than said it was getting better (16 percent). Should the stock market continue to slide, as it has in recent days, that perception could deepen and start to undermine the Clinton campaign.
Hillary Rodham Clinton's standing with the public is another potential danger point for the currently high-flying President. Only 30 percent of the public in the latest Times/CBS Poll holds a favorable impression of the First Lady.
Presumably, Mrs. Clinton's standing has been hurt by recent disclosures in the Whitewater affair and associated matters. But such issues do not appear to be deciding the votes of very many people, even though Mr. Clinton gets very poor ratings for honesty and integrity compared with Mr. Dole and even though more than one-third of all respondents (36 percent) said they believed the Clintons "did something wrong in connection with Whitewater."
Almost two-thirds of those questioned (61 percent) said they thought that Congressional hearings into the Whitewater affair conducted by the Republicans were "mostly a partisan attempt" to damage the Administration.
Asked which former President, living or dead, they would like to have running the country today, most citizens chose not Franklin D. Roosevelt or Abraham Lincoln, as might have been expected, but two more recent Chief Executives. John F. Kennedy was named by 28 percent and Ronald Reagan was the choice of 13 percent.

HEADLINE: THE OTHER DOLE -- A special report.;
Elizabeth Dole Is Eager To Keep Strength Subtle

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
The men and women running Bob Dole's Presidential campaign are happy to tell people what Elizabeth Dole is not. She is not, they say, Hillary Clinton, and she would not be an unelected policy maker as First Lady.
But recent interviews suggest that Mrs. Dole is in fact operating very much like Mrs. Clinton, and that the difference is one of semantics. The same senior advisers who characterize Mrs. Dole as "not Mrs. Clinton" readily admit that Mrs. Dole is her husband's closest adviser, with influence over policy and staff. They also call her the candidate's "chief surrogate," one who campaigns six days a week, mostly without Mr. Dole, to raise money and strengthen his support among groups like women and the Christian right. 
 Indeed, Mrs. Dole's life -- from the debutante cotillions of her Southern girlhood to her rise in Washington to her speeches spreading her evangelical Christian faith -- is the story of a woman whose beguiling charms have overshadowed her drive, discipline and pursuit of power.
Even Mrs. Dole describes herself as a spouse who sounds much like Mrs. Clinton in private, if not in public.
"I'm not in the staff meetings," Mrs. Dole said in a one-hour interview at Dole headquarters in Washington. "But certainly in terms of my relationship with my husband, getting in touch with the road, with Scott Reed, with Don Rumsfeld, with Steve Merrill, saying, 'I think we ought to do this or that,' or 'I'm seeing this or that' -- that's going on quite often." (Mr. Reed is the campaign's manager, Mr. Rumsfeld is a former Secretary of Defense and now a senior campaign adviser, and Mr. Merrill is the Governor of New Hampshire and the campaign's general chairman.)
It was Mrs. Dole, a senior campaign aide says, who insisted that the campaign hire a speech coach for her husband this spring. It was Mrs. Dole, the same aide says, who made sure that Mr. Dole's anti-crime address in Colorado in May included language that treated crime as a women's issue. It is Mrs. Dole whose suggestions on strategy and constant requests for background material irritate campaign aides and, the aides say, sometimes the candidate himself.
Mrs. Dole, who turns 60 on Saturday, dismisses as "crazy" the reports, most recently in the book "The Choice" by Bob Woodward, that Mr. Dole waited two weeks before telling her he wanted to resign from the Senate.
"We were right there together the whole time on this," she said. "And I was raising questions, and I wanted to be certain that he'd thought through every aspect." Mrs. Dole said the couple first talked about Mr. Dole's June 11 resignation during a Florida vacation in early April. Only afterward, she said, did they bring in Mr. Reed and then Haley Barbour, the Republican Party chairman.
Mrs. Dole receives the same written recommendations on strategy from the campaign that her husband does, and, like him, comes back to the staff with thoughts. But some aides to Mr. Dole point out that giving advice is not the same as having it taken, and they say Mrs. Dole is not always listened to. Mr. Dole, whose resistance to being "handled" is already legendary, himself suggested as much in an interview recently when he said that his wife had good political instincts "most of the time," adding, "She may have them all the time, but I don't accept them always."
That dynamic was on display two weeks ago when, in an interview on NBC's "Today" program to promote the re-issue of the Doles' joint autobiography, "Unlimited Partners," Mrs. Dole sat by helplessly while her husband snapped at Katie Couric, the interviewer, over nicotine and liberal bias in the media. "Let's talk about the book," Mrs. Dole cheerily interrupted. Her husband ignored her.
Mrs. Dole has been a Federal Trade Commissioner, Secretary of Transportation under President Ronald Reagan and Secretary of Labor under President George Bush. She is now on leave as president of the American Red Cross, where she oversees a $1.8 billion annual budget, 32,000 employees and 1.4 million volunteers.
While the Dole campaign is eager to remind voters that Mr. Dole is married to an unusually accomplished woman, one who in the words of the Dole pollster Tony Fabrizio puts a "very good face" on the campaign, strategists are fearful of alienating voters who might see Mrs. Dole as some see Mrs. Clinton -- a behind-the-scenes meddler with unchecked powers. But Mrs. Dole, who says she will return to the Red Cross whether or not her husband wins in November -- she dismisses critics who see a conflict of interest -- draws sharp distinctions between herself and Mrs. Clinton.
"I wouldn't have taken on 7 percent of the gross domestic product," she said, referring to Mrs. Clinton's effort to overhaul the nation's health-care system. "You're not elected, you're not confirmed by the Senate, and you've got one of the most volatile, high-visibility issues."
Mr. Dole himself so often says what his wife would not do as First Lady that at times he sounds as if he is belittling her. "When I'm elected, she will not be in charge of health care," he told a crowd in California last month. "Don't worry about it. Or in charge of anything else." When the crowd fell into an awkward silence at that last remark, Mr. Dole tried to recover. "I didn't say that," he said.
Although Mrs. Dole has been mentioned in the past as a possible Republican Vice-Presidential candidate -- even her husband says she is a better campaigner than he is -- she now adamantly denies any political ambitions, and aides say she is not using her current travels to build a network of her own for a future race. Mrs. Dole said that she merely wanted to be a good First Lady and that her project in the White House would be to increase charitable giving in the United States. As the first Presidential spouse to have a paying job, she said, she would leave state dinner menus and other traditional First Lady chores to her staff.
Mrs. Clinton, she said, has not set an example for her.
"I don't think she set a precedent," Mrs. Dole said. "I don't think each First Lady coming after her has to do what she has done. I wouldn't."

Her Character
Perfectionism And Restraint
By 11 on an overcast California morning, the women were already in line for lunch and a look at Mrs. Dole, on day five of a solo six-day swing to let the state know that her husband had not given it up. (Polls show President Clinton is far ahead of Mr. Dole in California.) When Mrs. Dole arrived at the lunch in Montecito two hours later, in a bright-red First Lady-like suit, with lipstick and nails to match, she quickly established herself as a natural campaigner conscious of the delicate balance she must strike as an independent woman and a political spouse.
"This morning I was asked if my husband and I ever have any difference of views on issues," Mrs. Dole began, coyly, in remarks to the 700-plus crowd at the Channel City Club. She went on to relate an often-told story about the time she and Mr. Dole debated each other over the creation of a consumer protection agency -- he against, she in favor -- on a morning news program.
"Now halfway through, my husband said, 'Elizabeth, you know I'd really like to say something if I could get a word in here somewhere,' " Mrs. Dole recounted, laughing. "And I said, 'Bob! I have not made my point yet!' And I kept right on going. I just ignored this guy, you know?"
The line got a big laugh as Mrs. Dole moved into the crowd, Phil Donahue-style, a body microphone clipped to her suit. "You think I can walk right down here?" she asked in her musical North Carolina drawl. Her tone was buttery as she spoke without notes, and her manners those of the old South -- a package the audience seemed to find captivating and unthreatening.
Four times in the last 20 years, Mrs. Dole has either quit or taken leave from powerful jobs to help along her husband's White House ambitions, first in 1976 when Mr. Dole was Gerald Ford's running mate, and then in 1980 and 1988 when he unsuccessfully pursued the Republican Presidential nomination. This year, as the presumed Republican nominee, Mr. Dole is closer than he has ever been to becoming President, although polls still show him well behind Mr. Clinton.
Whatever adjustments Mrs. Dole has had to make in sublimating her career, whatever resentments she may harbor, are not publicly evident in this campaign. In 1987, when she resigned as Secretary of Transportation to campaign for her husband, the press speculated that she was annoyed. This time, Mrs. Dole said that "it's a privilege for me to support him," and when pressed by a reporter about why she herself was not a candidate, lost patience. "Why don't you want to be?" she asked.
Mrs. Dole, her friend Jenna Dorn says, is far more complicated than her press suggests. Childhood friends describe her as intensely loyal, almost saintlike, a deeply religious woman who once treated a high school classmate and her family to an all-expenses-paid weekend in Washington after learning that her friend had cancer. Later, she paid for half of the classmate's chemotherapy. The same friends say Mrs. Dole has a sense of humor and can have fun; Roy Clason, her spokesman at the Red Cross, said she was once ahead of schedule in Minneapolis and insisted they stop for 25 minutes at an amusement park to ride the roller coaster.
But such moments of spontaneity are rare. Mrs. Dole in fact describes herself as a workaholic and a perfectionist who prepares prodigiously for every public moment of her life. "There are very few things that she takes lightly," said John Heubusch, who worked for her at the Labor Department and the Red Cross. Moments before her wedding, Mrs. Dole was still studying her marriage vows, according to a biography for middle-school readers by Carolyn Mulford. Mrs. Dole continues to wake up in the early morning and make lists, as she has done, she said, "on and off, most of my adult life."
In interviews Mrs. Dole is gracious but often stiff, and gets uneasy when she has to veer from her prepared answers. For example, in her speeches, Mrs. Dole calls the Red Cross a "mission field" and says, "It is not what I do that matters, but what a sovereign God chooses to do through me." But when asked if she thinks her Red Cross work is willed by God, she hesitated.
"I'm not sure," she said. "I've never really talked about all of this in great depth. I'm not sure. . . ." She stopped.
She wasn't sure where her interviewer was going with the question?
"Well, I'm not sure where I'm going," she said.
Unlike Mrs. Clinton, who was born only 11 years later but came of age in a feminist era, Mrs. Dole has never been comfortable with confrontation. Indeed, as power changed hands during Mrs. Dole's 30 years in Washington, she quietly switched her allegiance, from registered Democrat in the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration to independent under Richard M. Nixon to Republican when she married Mr. Dole.
And if her silken manners have served her well in a town as traditional as the nation's capital, where she never appeared to want the jobs she worked so hard to get, they have also made some people see her as artificial, or at least caused them to wonder what is really underneath. "I don't think anybody really knows her well," said Mrs. Dole's Harvard Law School roommate, Jean Eberhart Dubofsky, now a lawyer in Colorado.
Mrs. Dole's composure is broken only on rare occasions, as when Lesley Stahl on the CBS news program "60 Minutes" inadvertently called her by her childhood nickname, "Liddy."
"Elizabeth, Lesley," Mrs. Dole corrected on camera, visibly irritated.
Mrs. Dole's family and hometown friends from North Carolina still call her Liddy, but Mrs. Dole has worked hard, with limited success, to shed this bit of her past. When she left North Carolina and went north in the 1960's, the name stayed behind, at least until her husband's Presidential campaigns, when reporters from all over the country descended on her hometown of Salisbury and, to her great annoyance, heard "Liddy" everywhere. Elizabeth, she said ruefully, was gone overnight.
"Elizabeth is my preference," Mrs. Dole said. "I think it's a beautiful name. I love the name. It's just a normal, natural thing. If you like your name, you might like to be called it at some point in your life."

Her Faith
A Shift of Focus To Fill a Void
The most important event of Mrs. Dole's life in the last 15 years -- and one that has become politically crucial to her husband's campaign -- is what she calls her spiritual reawakening. Although she had been raised a devout Methodist, she said that by 1981, when she took a hard look at herself, she saw a woman tyrannized by her own perfectionism. "The career had become so all-consuming," she said. At the time, she was working 12-hour days and seven-day weeks in the Reagan White House. She was 45 years old, married for five years to a busy Senator, and childless.
"It was just a feeling that there's something missing here," she said, although she and her family say the void had nothing to do with not having children. "It would have been wonderful if it had happened," Mrs. Dole said. "We did marry later in life, and I think that's just clearly the answer. We just weren't, you know, 22. I was almost 40, and Bob was 53. So you're realistic."
Whatever the roots of her crisis, Mrs. Dole reached out to the Rev. Edward Bauman, then her minister at Foundry Methodist Church in Washington, who helped her join a prayer group. Mrs. Dole also called an old friend, Charles W. Colson, the former White House special counsel convicted for his role in the Watergate cover-up, now chairman of Prison Fellowship Ministries. Mr. Colson put Mrs. Dole in touch with Arthur Lindsley, a scholar at the C. S. Lewis Institute, a lay theological training center in Reston, Va. "The idea there was to focus on the intellectual underpinnings of your faith," Mrs. Dole said. She began to read the Bible for at least 30 minutes each day, and for the first time in years took Sundays off.
Mrs. Dole attended the prayer group until 1984 and, according to the biography by Ms. Mulford, went so far as to discuss with the members her offer from the White House to become Secretary of Transportation. "I have never met anyone who is quite so disciplined and focused in trying to live her faith," said Ms. Dorn, who met Mrs. Dole in the prayer group and is now a senior vice president at the Red Cross.
Although Mrs. Dole kept her religion private, a turning point came in 1987 when, in evangelical parlance, she "gave witness" at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington. Or, as she defines the term, "you explain what Christ has meant in your life." In that speech Mrs. Dole told the story of Esther, the Old Testament heroine who in risking her life to save the Jews chose faith and commitment over privilege and power. Esther, Mrs. Dole said in her speech, "has taken on great significance for me."
Mrs. Dole went on to tell the 3,000 prayer breakfast guests, including President Reagan, that she once "had God neatly compartmentalized, crammed into a crowded file drawer of my life, somewhere between 'gardening' and 'government.' " But she realized, she said, that it was "time to submit my resignation as master of my own little universe, and God accepted my resignation."
Although evangelicals would recognize Mrs. Dole's language as a description of a born-again experience, in the interview she shied away from the terminology. "Labels I think don't help," she said. "I'm a follower of Christ."
She added: "As you read the Bible, you see God's will in many places. It's a great guide for your life when you really get into it. I guess the bottom line for me is that I don't think I'm in this alone. I feel there is a source of strength beyond myself. I can call on God for wisdom. I try to think before something major is coming up to ask for His help."
In her speeches, Mrs. Dole speaks of the horrors she has seen in her travels for the Red Cross, particularly in Goma, Zaire, where in 1994 one million refugees from the ethnic war in neighboring Rwanda crossed over the border. She was, she says, "stepping over dead bodies." In "Unlimited Partners" Mrs. Dole tells of the time she gave camel's milk to a starving Somalian boy, and put her arm around his back. "The feeling of the little bones almost piercing through his flesh is something I will never forget," she recounts. Mrs. Dole says she cannot explain why God has allowed such things to happen.
"I just know my personal faith," she said. "Some questions really are a matter of mystery."
Since 1987, Mrs. Dole has spoken regularly to religious groups. She is a favorite of the Christian conservatives who do not trust her husband, particularly since he has distanced himself from the most vocal opponents of abortion. Religious conservatives are a vital part of Mr. Dole's support, and he cannot win the election without them.
Last October, Mrs. Dole appeared on the "Hour of Power" religious program of the television evangelist Robert Schuller, broadcast from the Crystal Cathedral in Anaheim, Calif. Mrs. Dole appealed for both money and blood donations to the Red Cross, then read a Psalm from the Bible.

Her Background
A Mix of Gentility And Achievement
Mrs. Dole grew up in a small Southern world of white gloves and petit fours, a princess of the landed gentry in Salisbury. Her father, John Van Hanford, was a successful flower wholesaler in the city of 25,000 deep within the Bible Belt. Her mother, Mary Hanford, belonged to the Daughters of the American Revolution. Elizabeth, born 13 years after her brother, John, was raised in a spacious tudor house on South Fulton Street. There was a spiral staircase in the front hall, an overgrown magnolia in the yard, and nursemaids to help with the children.
Mrs. Dole describes her childhood as idyllic. At the very least, it was well documented, as a visit to Mrs. Dole's 95-year-old mother in Salisbury proves. "Elizabeth began omitting her 2 A.M. bottle at 3 months of age," Mrs. Hanford wrote in the first of some 20 scrapbooks detailing every piano recital and Cabinet appointment of her daughter's six decades.
"I don't think I had much to do," said Mrs. Hanford, amused.
By 1945, the society page of The Salisbury Post was chronicling Liddy Hanford's ninth birthday party, with its 40 guests. "She wore a crisp frock of yellow dotted Swiss," the paper reported. "The birthday cake was arranged on a glass and wrought-iron table on the screened porch. About it were gardenias and yellow rosebuds."
At the time of her high school graduation, "Likable Liddy" was voted "Most Likely to Succeed," which surprised no one. "She was very, very bright, and she was very, very focused," said Betty Dan Spencer, a childhood friend. "We used to tease that she would be the first woman President."
Mrs. Dole went on to Duke University, was a debutante in Raleigh and in her senior year was elected both May Queen and Leader of the Year. Her scrapbooks -- which she was by now keeping herself -- also reveal a woman, however absorbed by her own paper trail, who was vulnerable to everyday anxieties. "Fred Sheheen called," says one note in the scrapbook, apparently scrawled in haste by a roommate. "Will call back, but if he doesn't, don't get in a panic."
But Mrs. Dole, unlike most of her friends, was not ready to settle down after graduation. "The young man I was pinned to started talking about getting married, and my reaction was, 'I'm too young, I've got all these things to do,' " she said. It was 1958, and she knew her choice was either a husband or a career, not both.
Mrs. Dole eventually went on to Harvard Law School, one of two dozen women in a class of 550. She graduated in 1965, headed for Washington -- a city, she has said, that attracted her "like a magnet" -- and by 1968 had a job in the office of Betty Furness, President Johnson's crusading consumer advocate.
When Mr. Nixon became President, he replaced Mrs. Furness with Virginia Knauer. Mrs. Dole not only survived the transition, but she also quickly became a favorite of her new boss. "I could count on her implicitly," Mrs. Knauer said. By 1973, Mrs. Knauer saw to it that Mrs. Dole was nominated for a spot on the Federal Trade Commission. A year earlier she had taken her protegee to a Pennsylvania Avenue sidewalk and introduced her to the newly divorced Senator from Kansas, Bob Dole, who as chairman of the Republican Party was opening a local headquarters.
"They sort of looked each other over," Mrs. Knauer said. Later, a piece of legislation gave Mrs. Knauer's protegee an excuse to reacquaint herself. "She said, 'Virginia, I think you should brief the Senator on this,' " Mrs. Knauer recalled. "Well, I knew Elizabeth pretty well -- and I could tell she wanted to get a second look."
The two were married in 1975 at Washington's National Cathedral. "I waited for the man I loved," Mrs. Dole said. By 1981, Mrs. Dole was running the White House Office of Public Liaison, where she fielded the complaints of interest groups -- women, blacks, veterans, farmers -- but found few men in the White House willing to listen to their concerns, or to her.
"She just had difficulty breaking into the inner circle," said her deputy at the time, Red Cavaney. Feminists were angry that Mrs. Dole did not support the Equal Rights Amendment, as she once had, but instead promoted Reagan alternatives. By 1983, when the Administration was worried about Mr. Reagan's weak support among women, the White House decided to promote Mrs. Dole to a far more visible job, Secretary of Transportation.
Over the next five years, Mrs. Dole oversaw the privatization of Conrail, made rear-window brake lights standard equipment in automobiles, and through a scheme that pitted the insurance industry against automobile manufacturers -- both praised and criticized for its political maneuverings -- eventually got credit for requiring airbags in cars.
Mrs. Dole became Secretary of Labor in 1989, and she was widely praised for intervening to settle the United Mine Workers strike against the Pittson Coal Company.
Mrs. Dole always mentions her work at the Red Cross in her campaign speeches, as she did in Montecito. Afterward, she invited the crowd to come up and "visit" a little with her at the dais.
"You should be Vice President," one woman said to her, echoing the others. "They're looking too hard."

HEADLINE: Dole Names Keynote Speaker And Sends Message to Women

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 15

 BODY:
Bob Dole said tonight that Representative Susan Molinari, a Staten Island Republican who supports abortion rights, would be the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention in August.
The Dole campaign had worked out in advance that Mr. Dole, the likely Republican Presidential nominee, would announce his choice of Ms. Molinari, the mother of a 2-month-old daughter and wife of Representative Bill Paxon of Buffalo, on CNN's "Larry King Live." But apparently no one had informed Ms. Molinari, and she gushed breathlessly from a restaurant in Buffalo when CNN tracked her down. 
 "She's dynamic, she's young, she's bright, she's articulate, she'll bring the Republican message all across the nation," Mr. Dole said, noting that the Republicans were not a "one-issue party."
Mr. Dole said the selection made a "big statement," both about abortion, an issue that has been bedeviling his campaign, and about women. Polls have shown his candidacy to be suffering from a gender gap, in which the vast majority of women have indicated a preference for President Clinton over Mr. Dole.
The candidate's wife, Elizabeth Hanford Dole, sat at his side and helped make that case, demonstrating that Mr. Dole can be comfortable with strong and independent women. Mr. King seemed to treat her as a spokesman for her husband, and Mrs. Dole frequently answered questions that are usually directed to a candidate, such as when Mr. King asked whether the campaign had communicated its messages.
"Oh, my goodness," she replied, going on to list tax cuts and letting families keep more of their income instead of "sending it off to the Government."
Mr. Dole appeared on the program as his poll ratings remain weak, although he insisted that the race was much closer than the 20 points that most national surveys suggest.
He also said that he had contacted Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania about possibly being his running mate, but averred that he had no real list from which he was working. Asked if he had any women under consideration, he hesitated, then said: "Yes, obviously," and joked later that he might ask his wife.
He said he expected to deliver his economic package by the end of this month. He told Mr. King that it would have "10 facets," one of which would involve tax cuts.
He also indicated that he regretted not having accepted an invitation earlier this month to speak at the N.A.A.C.P. convention. But he said he might meet with the group's board of directors and was arranging to speak with a group of black journalists.
A string of verbal stumbles has put Mr. Dole on the political defensive lately, and Mr. King asked if he would admit to any mistakes.
"I made enough of them during the last few weeks to last through a month or two," he said, adding: "But I like to get them out of the way -- you got any other mistakes I can make?"
Despite his political woes, Mr. Dole appeared relaxed and good-humored.
Mr. Dole made the announcement about Ms. Molinari without first informing her. "Maybe I should call her during the break," Mr. Dole mused on the air. CNN workers then tracked down Ms. Molinari at a Buffalo restaurant, and before the program was over, Ms. Molinari was on the line effusively thanking Mr. Dole and promising that she would "check and double-check" her speech in advance "with Mrs. Dole and Bob Dole."
Mr. Dole used the Molinari announcement as a stepping-off point to talk about his record of appointing women. "Keep in mind," he said, "I appointed the first woman secretary of the senate in the history of the Senate, the first chief of staff was a woman in my organization. I've been living with a Cabinet member."
When Mr. King asked the candidate if he were a "feminist," Mrs. Dole replied, "He is a strong supporter of women."
Another moment illustrated the dynamic between the Doles. When Mr. King was talking about trust and Mr. Dole said, "I just have to lay out my case," there was chatter all around before he concluded, "And she can do it better than I can." Mrs. Dole was holding up a finger, indicating she wanted to speak, and Mr. King said, "Go ahead, Elizabeth."
"I've got one more thing I want to say," she began, "and that is that I think that, clearly, trust is so key."
Mr. King asked her about her previously announced plans to go back to work as President of the American Red Cross even if Mr. Dole is elected. She confirmed that plan.
"I'll be a supportive spouse," she added, "a supportive spouse, because this is the most difficult, challenging job in the world, and that's when Bob will need my love and support more than ever. So as with spouses all across America, I'm going to be a supportive helpmate."

HEADLINE: A POWER STRUGGLE IS SEEN AS YELTSIN ENTERS SANITARIUM

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, July 15

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin today heightened alarm about his health and gave new impetus to a power struggle in the Kremlin when he abruptly left Moscow for a sanitarium.
His sudden departure for what an aide described as a two-week vacation stunned an American delegation headed by Vice President Al Gore, whose meeting with Mr. Yeltsin was canceled at the last minute. The Americans had hoped to use the meeting to underscore support for the Russian President and assess his physical stamina following a grueling re-election campaign. 
 Mr. Yeltsin, who is 65 and has a history of heart disease, has not appeared in public for nearly three weeks, except in taped television addresses and brief, carefully staged photo opportunities.
Before leaving the Kremlin, Mr. Yeltsin injected a new element into the power struggle there by naming Anatoly B. Chubais, a free-market advocate, as his new chief of staff. Just six months ago, Mr. Chubais was forced out of office by an embattled President Yeltsin, who sought to turn the reformer into a scapegoat for alleged favoritism and insider dealing that grew out of the program to privatize state-owned industries. But throwing his support behind Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Chubais helped mastermind the President's successful election campaign.
Mr. Chubais's appointment as a replacement for the hawkish Nikolai Yegorov will strengthen the role of economic reformers in the Government at the expense of hard-liners.
It appeared to leave three strong, ambitious men jockeying for position as Mr. Yeltsin's energy is in doubt: Mr. Chubais, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, the resilient and cautious Prime Minister, and Aleksandr I. Lebed, the erstwhile general and presidential candidate enlisted as Mr. Yeltsin's national security adviser.
Mr. Gore was preparing to leave for the Kremlin when he received the news that Mr. Yeltsin was leaving for the Barvikha sanitarium outside Moscow, the same sanitarium the President has gone to twice before to recover from heart ailments.
The American Embassy frantically notified reporters that Mr. Gore's midday press conference had been postponed due to "scheduling problems," while American officials insisted that the two leaders would meet on Tuesday at Mr. Yeltsin's retreat.
But even as Mr. Yeltsin's most loyal lieutenants sought to put the best face on the situation, they acknowledged that the campaign had taken a heavy toll on the President.
"He is really very tired, and he just needs a good, proper holiday," said Sergei K. Medvedev, Mr. Yeltsin's spokesman.
Mr. Yeltsin has a long history of recurring illness, evidently aggravated by an appetite for vodka, that has sometimes led to periods of strange behavior or disappearance from public view.
In September 1994, he created a stir when he failed to emerge from his plane during for a scheduled meeting at Shannon Airport with Ireland's Prime Minister.
More recently, Mr. Yeltsin dropped out of sight during the final days leading up to the July 3 presidential runoff election and has barely been visible since, his major appearances being recorded televised addresses.
Mr. Yeltsin was hospitalized twice last year for acute ischemia, a heart problem. He also has suffered from back trouble and other ailments in recent years.
Two days after Mr. Yeltsin's election victory, President Clinton said he talked to him by telephone for about 25 minutes and "I didn't have to ask him about his health because he sounded so good."
Clinton Administration officials say Mr. Yeltsin needs a heart operation. But the President stubbornly refused to take a break in recent months, campaigning at a breakneck pace.
Mr. Gore, for his part, had little to say today about Mr. Yeltsin's health problems and the canceled meeting. "I learned this morning that it would be postponed until tomorrow," Mr. Gore said.
The appointment of Mr. Chubais seemed likely to curb Mr. Lebed's bid for influence within the newly elected Yeltsin Government. Since he was named to his post as the top national security official, Mr. Lebed has talked openly about his presidential ambitions and his desire to extend his current authority into other spheres, including economics.
He has suggested that an economist be appointed to the Security Council, a policymaking body he heads, and, to the consternation of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, has predicted a downturn in the economy in the fall.
Mr. Chernomyrdin has made it clear that he has no desire to cede authority over economic policy to Mr. Lebed.
And Mr. Chubais, a trained economist who played a pivotal role in recent years in helping Russia move toward capitalism, also indicated that he intended to play a central role in enforcing Mr. Yeltsin's decisions, strengthening pro-reform local authorities and mobilizing popular support for continued reforms.
Sergei A. Filatov, Mr. Yeltsin's former chief of staff, said that he expected Mr. Chubais to recruit more "people with a liberal, democratic orientation."
Today's meetings between American and Russian specialists were overseen by Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin as part of a regular forum on broad range of economic, political and military issues. Exhausted by the long campaign and with many key appointments yet to be made, Mr. Yeltsin and his top aides were not poised to make major breakthroughs in the talks.
Still, some progress was made. The Russians agreed to roll back new excise taxes on six American-Russian joint oil ventures, which account for the bulk of American foreign investment in Russia.
The Russian Government had ordered that the excise taxes be raised from 16,000 rubles a ton to 70,000 a ton. But in meetings today with Mr. Gore and Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, the Russian side agreed that the tax would be reduced to 20,000 rubles a ton for at least another year.
American officials said the change would make the difference between profit and loss for the companies involved.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in Panicky Selloff Wrenched by Volatile Stocks

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Violent swings in the United States stock market wrenched the dollar's value down yesterday in a panicky selloff that left the currency at the weakest level against the German mark in more than three months.
Currency traders called it the worst one-day slide of the dollar this year and said Wall Street's spasms had become the main driving force behind the currency's behavior. 
 "With the stock market environment, people just dumped the dollar," said Nathaniel Litwak, manager of foreign exchange trading at the New York branch of Banque Indosuez. "We saw selling that we haven't seen in months."
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.4806 marks, down from 1.5165 on Monday, a drop of 2.4 percent. It was the lowest level against the mark since April 4. The dollar also fell to 109.25 Japanese yen, down from 110.36 and its lowest level since June 27. The British pound rose to $1.5595 from $1.5525.
For the second consecutive day, the currency market hung on the American stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average, which tumbled 161.05 points on Monday, fell more than 167 points before recovering to end the day up 9.25 points.
Currency traders focused on Wall Street's drop because it raised fear that foreign investors might liquidate their holdings in the United States and move their money elsewhere, creating a surge of dollars on the market. As the dollar fell through important technical support levels it incited more selling.
"We had a panic selling of the dollar," said Elena Shperling, head of foreign-exchange trading at the New York branch of Banco di Sicilia. "When we come up with something like this, everyone's getting out of the way."
In what appeared to be a move to help talk up the dollar, the president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, said the German central bank was not considering an interest rate increase in the foreseeable future. He also held out the possibility of lower rates, which could weaken the mark against the dollar.
But Mr. Tietmeyer's statement had no discernible effect in foreign-exchange trading.
"The overriding fact was the U.S. equity markets drove the dollar today," said Thomas Benfer, foreign exchange director at the New York branch of the Bank of Montreal.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Turkey Wings It

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey

 BODY:
While traveling, you are often asked what you do for a living. Lately I answer that I'm a foreign affairs columnist and that means I cover wars -- occasionally wars between countries but more often the wars between economic winners and losers within countries. Because it is these domestic wars that increasingly shape international affairs, from Russia to Mexico to Turkey.
Why have such internal wars become so sharp? The short answer is "globalization" -- the integration of free markets, financial flows, trade and information -- which has established a very powerful set of rules and standards for how countries have to behave if they are going to attract investment capital to grow. You can call those rules "The Paradigm." Once a country opens itself up to the global market and accepts The Paradigm, those of its citizens with the skills to take advantage of it become the winners and those without become losers or left-behinds. 
 In those countries where all political parties have basically accepted The Paradigm, there really isn't much difference anymore between ruling and opposition parties. In most countries, though, there is usually one party that runs against The Paradigm, offering populist solutions that claim to be able to defy globalization or ease its pain. That's Pat Buchanan in America, the Communists in Russia and now the Islamic Welfare Party here in Turkey.
In other words, the coming to power last week by the Islamic Welfare Party is part of a trend, but it's not the trend of Islamic fundamentalism. It's the trend of the backlash against globalization.
In the 1980's Turkey went from being a relatively closed, Socialist economy to opening itself to the global market. But it did so without many of the institutions to prevent huge disparities of income when its economy started to be privatized and without effective social safety nets to cushion the impact of globalization on traditional society. As a result, those who understood the new game flourished; those who didn't got left behind or flocked from farms to cities in search of work in the new industries of the global economy, creating a huge urban underclass.
The reason the Islamic Welfare Party was finally able to take power last week was a fluke: former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, in a venal bid to avoid prosecution for corruption, agreed to join a coalition Government under the Welfare Party leader, Necmettin Erbakan, if he blocked her indictment. But it was also part of a trend in which the Welfare Party has steadily built support among Turkey's new urban underclass. As one wealthy Turkish businessman remarked to me, the Welfare Party "is the loser's way of punishing us." Mr. Erbakan's first decision was not to pass out Korans, but to raise civil service wages by 50 percent. Even many secular Turks, fed up with their own parties, are ready to give Welfare a chance.
So the Welfare Party's mandate is not to bring more God into Turkish life but to bring more good -- good services and good government. Welfare cannot do what the majority of Turks want without in some way adapting itself to the rules and limits of The Paradigm. Turkey is not like other Islamic states. Iran's mullah's can live outside The Paradigm because they have oil. Sudan's mullahs can live outside The Paradigm because they have nothing. Turkey has no oil, but it has a huge industrial base. To survive economically it must sell a thousand different products globally. Turkey cannot live outside The Paradigm, and Mr. Erbakan will learn that.
So what's happening in Turkey is much more complicated than just a Muslim fundamentalist takeover. It is what happens when widening globalization spins off more and more losers, while widening democratization gives them all a vote, while religious parties effectively exploit this coincidence to take power. Whether these religious parties can actually rule more effectively, and deal with the demands of The Paradigm, remains to be seen. So watch Turkey, but don't panic. Its quandary applies to many U.S. allies: how to make the transition from a closed society to the global market while maintaining political stability. Helping allies manage this transition could become the most important issue of U.S. foreign policy.

HEADLINE: Myron Goldsmith, Architect And Engineer, Is Dead at 77

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
Myron Goldsmith, an architect and engineer whose work merged the jewel-like precision of Mies van der Rohe with the greyhound-sleek forms of Pier Luigi Nervi, died on Monday at his home in Wilmette, Ill. He was 77.
The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Robin. 
 A student both of Mies and of Nervi, two of the century's most important architects, Mr. Goldsmith brought their influence to bear on more than 40 projects he designed around the nation for the firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, where he worked from 1955 to 1983, the last 16 years as a general partner in its Chicago office.
Like Mies, Mr. Goldsmith sought to express the structural essence of his buildings in their exteriors, unmasked by ornament. Like Nervi, he designed with the sweeping arcs and long spans made possible by new technologies. The results were almost sculptural: cool, spare, gleaming and hard-edged.
Mr. Goldsmith's best-known work was the McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope Facility of 1962, at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, which draws some 100,000 visitors a year.
Crowning a mountaintop near Tucson, the structure looks like the bottom half of the letter K, with a 110-foot tower joined to a shaft that runs 500 feet above and below ground. Both tower and shaft are diamond-shaped, clad in copper panels that are painted white.
Although it appears abstract, the shape is actually a reflection of pure function, since the 32-degree angle of the shaft parallels the axis of the earth's rotation, allowing the viewing angle of the sun to remain constant. And the diamond shape helps reduce wind turbulence on the surface.
Mr. Goldsmith distilled his philosophy in a 1987 monograph: "A building should be built with economy, efficiency, discipline and order."
The work of Miesian architects was widely dismissed in the 1970's and 80's as cold, sterile, repetitive and inhumanly scaled. But Mr. Goldsmith was not singled out for criticism.
Moreover, he was disarming in person, almost an antithesis of his architecture; perpetually rumpled, with a bird's-nest tangle of hair and a shy, soft-spoken demeanor. "He managed with gentleness to exist and prosper in a field that is otherwise eaten up by tigerish egos," said Franz Schulze, an art historian and Mies biographer.
Mr. Goldsmith was born in Chicago and graduated in 1939 from the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he studied under Mies, whose Chicago office he joined in 1946. He worked there until 1953, when he received a Fulbright Grant to study under Nervi at the University of Rome.
His first major projects at Skidmore were two United Air Lines hangars at San Francisco International Airport, one of which used cantilevered steel girders to form a structure large enough to house four DC-8 jetliners.
Other significant projects were the Oakland Alameda County Coliseum of 1966, in California, which includes a circular arena 420 feet in diameter, ringed by a 70-foot-high glass wall behind enormous concrete X-braces; and The Republic newspaper plant in Columbus, Ind., completed in 1971, whose delicate aluminum and glass skin allowed passers-by to view the newsroom and pressroom.
Left unbuilt was the Ruck-a-Chucky Bridge, which was to have spanned the American River in Auburn, Calif., northeast of Sacramento. Recalling somewhat a cat's-cradle on a giant scale, the curving bridge deck would have been suspended from a network of steel cables anchored in the surrounding mountainsides.
Mr. Goldsmith had been a professor of architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology since 1961. His students' theses in long-span structures and high-rise buildings were frequently prototypes for new engineering systems used in actual projects, like the John Hancock Center in Chicago.
At the time of his death, he was a member of a team organized by the institute to design a 115- to 120-story office, hotel and commercial structure in Seoul for the Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company. The project, known as "Hankang City," may end up as the world's tallest building.
Besides his wife, Mr. Goldsmith is survived by a son, Marc, of Tempe, Ariz.; a daughter, Chandra, of Boston, and a sister, Bernice Colner of Pacific Palisades, Calif.

HEADLINE: U.S. to Tell Serbs They Face New Sanctions

BYLINE: By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, July 16

 BODY:
Richard C. Holbrooke, the special American envoy to the Balkans, plans to tell President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia on Wednesday that economic sanctions will be reimposed on Serbia unless the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, is both removed from power and leaves Bosnia, two senior Western officials said.
Mr. Holbrooke made this stance clear today in meetings with top Bosnian Government officials and senior international civilian and military officials, said two officials familiar with the meetings. 
 Mr. Holbrooke, who arrived here today and will go on to Belgrade on Wednesday, told officials here that he would demand Dr. Karadzic's "immediate" departure from Bosnia, but did not specify a date. Nor did he say where Dr. Karadzic -- who is under international indictment for war crimes and subject to arrest -- should go.
Mr. Holbrooke acknowledged that he did not know if Mr. Milosevic could be persuaded, an official with knowledge of his plans said.
Out of office and out of Bosnia are Mr. Holbrooke's "minimum" conditions for Dr. Karadzic's removal, said one official, who declined to say what else the American envoy would tell Mr. Milosevic. The Bosnian Serbs have already been threatened with exclusion from the Bosnian elections later this year if Dr. Karadzic remains as chairman of the Serb Democratic Party.
Mr. Holbrooke, who negotiated the Dayton peace agreement last fall and then left Government service, was called back by President Clinton this week, after the allies had been repeatedly outmaneuvered by Dr. Karadzic.
"We're here because we're not satisfied with the degree of compliance on the part of the parties in the region with the Dayton agreement, above all with attitudes of noncompliance by the Bosnian Serbs," Mr. Holbrooke said when he arrived at the Sarajevo airport.
And Mr. Holbrooke delivered a message to the Bosnian Serbs, who have been threatening to harm NATO forces if any attempt is made to seize Dr. Karadzic. If they take any action against Western forces, he said, "They'll be met with swift military action."
Just how much leverage Mr. Holbrooke can bring to bear on Mr. Milosevic to achieve compliance with the demands is unclear. Although under the Dayton accord the senior military and civilian overseers in Bosnia can reimpose economic sanctions, many countries would have to take quick action for them to be effective. But major Western powers have shown little unity on the subject.
Only Germany fully endorses the ultimatum Mr. Holbrooke will deliver. Russia, which feels that Dr. Karadzic has already surrendered enough of his power, is adamantly opposed to reimposing sanctions, Britain has strong objections, and France is lukewarm, diplomats say, but the British and French will keep their reservations quiet.
One looming question over Mr. Holbrooke's mission is whether the threat of sanctions would, in any case, be enough to impel Mr. Milosevic to take action. The international economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations in the summer of 1992 were never fully effective, because of wide-spread leakage. But they hurt Serbia economically and Mr. Milosevic fought hard to have them lifted. They were suspended only after Mr. Milosevic signed the peace agreement.
A decision of the United Nations Security Council is not needed to reimpose sanctions, according to international diplomats here. They said they can be reimposed by the commander of the NATO-led forces in Bosnia, Adm. Leighton Smith, or the chief civilian in charge of putting the accords into effect, Carl Bildt.
And Admiral Smith is prepared to do so, said an official, in part because such a step would relieve the mounting pressure on the NATO forces to launch a military operation to seize Dr. Karadzic.
En route to Sarajevo, Mr. Holbrooke stopped in Brussels, where the senior political and military leaders of NATO gave full support to his negotiating position, an official said.
Robert H. Frowick, a former United States diplomat who is overseeing the elections as head of the Bosnia mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, has said that if Dr. Karadzic remains as chairman of the Serb Democratic Party, the party -- by far the major political force in the Serb-held portion of Bosnia -- will not be allowed to take part in the national elections scheduled for Sept. 14. On Monday he delayed the official start of campaigning until Friday, to give Dr. Karadzic time to step down.

HEADLINE: POLITICS: THE ISSUES;
White House Report Foresees A Sharp Decline in the Deficit

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
The Clinton White House issued its midsummer revised economic forecast today, predicting that the Federal budget deficit this fiscal year would be $116.8 billion -- $29 billion less than the Administration forecast just this spring and only a third of its level when Mr. Clinton took office.
The White House used the good news to make good politics, sending out a bevy of senior officials to brag about it at a morning briefing where they attributed it to Mr. Clinton's 1993 deficit reduction package. 
 The White House also said that it expected the domestic economy to grow by 2.6 percent this year, up from its previous forecast of 2.2 percent growth and the 1.5 percent rise of 1995.
"The fact is, our economy is now the soundest it's been in a generation," Mr. Clinton said today in a speech to the National Governors' Association.
The President added that as a percentage of the economy, the deficit was at its lowest level since 1974: 1.6 percent of gross domestic product, by far the lowest current level for any of the world's leading industrialized nations.
The news was a sort of vindication for Mr. Clinton, who has tried to make cutting the deficit a centerpiece of his first term but has seldom received the credit he seeks.
Congressional Republicans were quick to acknowledge the political potency of the deficit's decline, but just as quick to take credit for it.
The chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, said that "the deficit is this low because of Republican reform efforts, not any new action on the President's part."
Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said that much of the decline was a result of nothing more than revisions in technical assumptions and economic forecasts.
"The Administration taking credit for it," Mr. Domenici said, "is like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise."
In fact, last summer Mr. Clinton decided to match the Republicans' goal of balancing the budget by just after the turn of the century, having previously resisted a specific deadline. Today the White House said the improved forecasts would actually produce a budget surplus of $25.8 billion in 2001 and $60.9 billion in 2002.
Indeed, the one potential dark lining for Mr. Clinton in this silver cloud is that the deficit has now shrunk so much that Republicans may be tempted to propose a larger tax cut than can be easily financed, and thus put him on the defensive as a dour-faced deficit hawk. But Republicans, too, are heavily invested in balancing the budget, and, compared with the alternatives, stolidity is a risk the Administration seems happy enough to take.
The new estimate, if realized, would mean a decline from an actual deficit of $164 billion for the 1995 budget year and would mark the fourth consecutive year of declining deficits.
The midsession review does forecast a slight increase in the deficit next year, to $125.7 billion. But the Administration projects steady declines after that, and a budget surplus five years from now. That would be the first time since 1969 that the Government had not run a deficit.
Residents of the Okimaw Ohci Healing Lodge in Maple Creek, Saskatchewan, the first Canadian penal institution designed specifically for Indian offenders, embrace after holding a "talking circle," at which they freely discuss what is on their minds.

HEADLINE: Mr. Yeltsin's Health Problems

 BODY:
President Clinton and Vice President Gore may find it politic to downplay Boris Yeltsin's latest physical setback, but that is no reason for the rest of us to ignore what is happening. The freshly re-elected President of Russia is once again in precarious health. Should he become incapacitated, the ability of Russia's fledgling democracy to effect an orderly transfer of power will be put to a severe test.
Mr. Yeltsin's withdrawal to a sanitarium outside Moscow may indeed merely be prompted by extreme fatigue after an exhausting electoral campaign, as Mr. Clinton, Mr. Gore and Kremlin aides hopefully suggest. But it could also signal a recurrence of the serious heart problems that sent him to the same place twice before or the drinking bouts that have periodically immobilized him. 
 Mr. Yeltsin's sudden disappearance from public view in the midst of the presidential runoff campaign, his last-minute rescheduling of a key meeting with Mr. Gore and his abrupt departure from Moscow this week have unleashed a flood of Kremlin speculation and brought worried concern in foreign capitals. The happiest outcome for Russian democracy and American interests would be for Mr. Yeltsin to return speedily to full strength and serve out his new four-year term. Should he falter, now or later, the next best alternative would be an orderly transition to his constitutional successor, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Whatever one thinks of Mr. Chernomyrdin, it is critical to reinforce the validity of constitutional processes and avoid a free-for-all scramble for power.
Mr. Yeltsin's latest health crisis has quickened the jockeying for position among his top deputies -- Mr. Chernomyrdin, Aleksandr Lebed, the national security adviser, and Anatoly Chubais, the newly appointed presidential chief of staff.
Mr. Chubais, whose appointment on Monday suggests that Mr. Yeltsin is still cogent and making important decisions about his administration, is an architect of the radical economic reform that marked Mr. Yeltsin's first years in office. Earlier this year Mr. Yeltsin cast him aside as a sop to populist anger over the rise of a rich, and unpopular, Russian business class. His return marks an acknowledgment that the newly privatized businesses he helped bring into being are now an important new political constituency. It is also a reward for the political skills he displayed in Mr. Yeltsin's successful electoral campaign.
Mr. Lebed is a retired general who ran a surprisingly strong third in the first round of the presidential contest before joining forces with Mr. Yeltsin for the runoff. He is a strong nationalist who is transparently ambitious for the presidency. But he is also politically inexperienced and has an alarming penchant for disparaging remarks about ethnic and religious minorities.
Mr. Chernomyrdin comes from the ranks of the elite industrial managers under Communism. He represents a centrist, steady hand on the Government and economy but shares responsibility for the Government's reckless spending spree to bolster Mr. Yeltsin's election campaign. He has also been criticized for extending favors to his former company, Gazprom, and other large state enterprises jockeying for position in the new Russian economy. But as Prime Minister he has proved a successful crisis manager and has acted as a sober counterweight to the often impulsive Mr. Yeltsin.
What most entitles Mr. Chernomyrdin to Washington's recognition as Mr. Yeltsin's heir apparent is his constitutional position. America's relations with a country as geopolitically important as Russia must go beyond personalities. They should focus on the orderly development of Russia's new political institutions, including respect for election results and constitutional succession provisions.

HEADLINE: Those Slam-Dunk Salaries

 BODY:
Free-agent season opened for National Basketball Association players last week, with dazzling financial rewards for a handful of superstars. Michael Jordan, the world's best player, won the sport's best salary -- a reported $25 million for one year. Shaquille O'Neal, the gargantuan center for the Orlando Magic, was reportedly offered over $95 million for seven years by the Los Angeles Lakers -- a contract the Lakers expect Mr. O'Neal to rip up after three years to collect much more. But Shaq will have to balance that against a $115 million seven-year offer to stay with the Magic. Juwan Howard, a 23-year-old player for the Washington Bullets, jumped to the Miami Heat for $98 million over seven years. That would make him only the second-best-paid player on the Heat, which reportedly offered its center, Alonzo Mourning, about $10 million more.
But there is another, less eye-catching side to the N.B.A. salary follies. The combination of free agency, which allows players to switch teams, and salary caps, which limit the total payroll that teams can pay players, is producing a high-rent replica of the American economy at large. Superstar incomes are soaring, leaving everyone else behind. 
 The league caps the total amount that owners can pay players, currently at $24.3 million a year, though salaries of longtime team members are in effect exempt when their contracts expire. That loophole allowed Chicago to pay Michael Jordan, whose contract expired this year, more than its entire team salary cap. The system compels owners to pay fabulous amounts to woo or keep superstars. But such payouts push down the salaries of unspectacular players. Having lost Mr. Howard to Miami, the Bullets now must go out and wave big bucks at another superstar. That superstar's salary must fit under the team's cap, since he will be a newcomer to the team. Thus the team will virtually have to turn around and offer secondary players of only slightly less spectacular ability that much less.
No one will cry over players who earn a mere quarter-million dollars. But the ballooning inequality mirrors the trend taking place in the economy outside the sports pavilion. Cable television and other modern telecommunications bring Mr. Jordan's talents before worldwide audiences and, therefore, advertisers. He earns $25 million because he generates enormous revenue. That is precisely why the head of Disney, Michael Eisner, takes home as much as hundreds of millions in a year. He may not be able to dunk a basketball, but his decisions have worldwide reverberations, adding billions to Disney's coffers -- or subtracting them.
There is one big difference, however. Mr. Eisner's pay takes nothing out of the pockets of other Disney employees. But because of the salary cap imposed by the owners of professional basketball teams, what goes into the pocket of one superstar may come out of the pockets of lesser players.

Treasury Prices Show Gain for Day

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher, jostled by a rocky stock market but supported by benign consumer inflation data for June.
"The bond market had a fairly volatile session caused by the movements in the equity market," said Michael Strauss, chief economist at Yamaichi International (America) Inc. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 19/32, to 87 11/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 7.02 percent, from 7.07 percent on Monday. The gains came as the Dow Jones industrial average seesawed throughout the session. After dropping more than 150 points, the Dow closed up 9.25 points.
" We had flight-to-quality buying and then sold again when stocks started to stabilize," a trader said.
Despite recent price movement, pundits said the Treasury market remained in a trading range as no fundamental change in the economic scenario appears to have taken place. "The range is centered on 7 percent," said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, referring to the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond.
Bonds were also bolstered by a report showing that consumer prices rose one-tenth of 1 percent in June, slightly below the expectations of most economists. Excluding food and energy, the index was two-tenths of 1 percent.
The report helped ease fears that the Federal Reserve would need to raise short-term interest rates soon to prevent inflation from accelerating. Such fears had escalated after an employment report on July 5 showed unexpected strength in the economy. While many in the market still look for the Fed to push up rates in the coming months, the report on consumer prices suggested that a rate increase might not be sooner or sharper than expected.
Still, there remains uncertainty over the direction of the economy following a robust second quarter and over what course of action the Fed will take.
"There is a degree of uncertainty about the outlook for the economy," Mr. Jones of Lanston said, adding that his own view calls for "reasonably good" momentum going into the second half.
Traders reported heavy selling in intermediate maturities -- mainly 10-year notes --- in late morning trade related to weakness, which was pulled down by the drop in stocks.
In addition, market strategists said they saw some sporadic flows from the stock market into Treasuries.
They said, however, most of the purchasing power was concentrated in the short end of the curve as players moved out of stocks and increased their holdings of cash or cash equivalent securities.
"Most of the activity has been going on in the short end of the market," said Josh Stiles, senior bond strategist at consulting firm I.D.E.A. Inc. "You get the dollar and the Dow together propping up the short end relative to the long end."
The bill sector of the curve -- with maturities ranging from three months to one year -- ended higher. The two-year note was up 5/32 at 100 3/32, to yield 6.20 percent.
In the corporate bond market, prices of junk bonds were weighed down by a wildly swinging stock market and closed mostly unchanged despite gains in Treasury securitities, traders said.
But investment-grade corporate bonds moved lockstep with government securities in thin trading.
In the municipal market, First Chicago Capital Markets Inc. said yesterday that it hadrepriced $487 million Cook County, Ill., general obligation bonds, adding several maturities and raising the top yield in 2022 to 6.13 percent from 6.10 percent. The offering contained both capital improvement and refunding bonds.

Caterpillar Posts a 16% Rise In Profit Despite Lower Sales

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 16

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc. said today that earnings rose 16 percent in the second quarter despite a decline in equipment sales.
The company, a leading maker of earth-moving, construction and farming equipment as well as diesel engines, earned $374 million, or $1.94 a share, in the quarter ended June 30, up from $323 million, or $1.62 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The results exceeded Wall Street estimates of $1.64 a share. 
 Shares of Caterpillar rose $2.625 today, to $66.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 Caterpillar, which is based in Peoria, Ill., said revenues for the quarter slipped to $4.18 billion from $4.21 billion, primarily because of lower sales of diesel engines. It said equipment sales fell to $4.01 billion from $4.06 billion.
 The company also said it expected sales and profits for all of 1996 to be above 1995 levels. The company posted sales of $16.07 billion and profits of $1.14 billion last year.
 Improved prices helped offset lower machinery and engine sales volume, Caterpillar said, adding that a favorable change in the geographic sales mix helped profits.
 These factors were partly offset by higher sales discounts and the negative effect of the stronger dollar on sales in European currencies, the company said.
 "This was really a gross margin story as the result of the cumulative benefits of restructuring," said Barry Bannister, an analyst with S. G. Warburg & Company. "I think they'll be slightly up this year in earnings over last year."
 Other analysts warned that the earnings gain might have been inflated by currency factors.
 "In terms of the business fundamentals, it's not as much as you'd like to shout about, being that they beat consensus by 30 cents," said Lisa Shalett of Sanford C. Bernstein.
 As a result of economic growth in the United States that was stronger than expected, worldwide machine sales for the industry are close to 1995 levels, Caterpillar said, despite demand from Europe that was weaker than expected.
American industry demand for machines is expected to be just slightly below 1995 levels, an improvement over Caterpillar's earlier forecast, the company said.
 Worldwide demand for engines, however, is still expected to be lower than last year, Caterpillar said, while domestic demand is expected to decline, but less than thought earlier.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Sprint and Ameritech Post A Rise in Their Earnings

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Two of the nation's largest telephone companies posted higher second-quarter earnings yesterday, reflecting increases in phone traffic and in demand for more phone lines.
The Sprint Corporation, the nation's No. 3 long-distance company after the AT&T Corporation and MCI Communications, reported a 30 percent profit rise on its highest long-distance volume and revenue growth in six years; it also posted a 5.3 percent increase in local phone lines. 
 Earnings of the Ameritech Corporation, a regional Bell operating company based in Chicago, rose 12.5 percent, as the number of phone lines increased by 4.2 percent and the number of cellular customers rose 40 percent.
Results are driven by "people who are putting in second lines for telecommuting and Internet access," said Michael Balhoff, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker. "And the economy has been very good."
Sprint, based in Westwood, Kan., said profit from continuing operations rose to $316.8 million, or 73 cents a share, from $245.7 million, or 70 cents, a year earlier, matching the average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by IBES International Inc.
"Sprint is hitting on all cylinders," said Frank Governali, an analyst at CS First Boston. "There appear to be no areas of weakness."
Shares rose 62.5 cents, to $37.875 in late afternoon trading.
Revenue rose 12 percent, to $3.51 billion from $3.14 billion.
"Revenues, operating income and margins in our long-distance operations hit record levels," said William T. Esrey, chairman and chief executive. That offset losses from Sprint's new international venture, Global One, and its new United States wireless operations, Sprint Spectrum.
Volume, or the minutes of use on Sprint's long-distance network, rose 19 percent. Analysts said that would be about double AT&T's volume growth and above MCI Communications'.
"Their 10-cents-a-minute rate anytime, anywhere in the U.S. is getting them residential long-distance left and right," said Ellen Clifford, an analyst at Telechoice Inc., a Verona, N.J., consulting firm.
Sprint said its second-quarter loss from its start-up operations widened to $44 million, or 10 cents a share, from $6 million, or 2 cents. The start up operations include its Global One joint venture with France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom as well as Sprint Spectrum, its wireless alliance with Tele-Communications Inc., the Comcast Corporation and Cox Communications.
In the latest period, income of $300,000 from discontinued operations from the spinoff of its cellular business in March resulted in net income of $316.8 million, or 73 cents a share. In the 1995 period, income of $2.5 million, or 1 cent a share, from discontinued operations, resulted in net income of $245.7 million, or 70 cents.
Per-share results in the second quarter also reflect a 24 percent increase in the number of shares outstanding to 434.1 million from 350.2 million because of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom's purchase of 20 percent of Sprint for $4.2 billion last year.
Ameritech said earnings rose 12.5 percent, to $567 million, or $1.02 a share, from $504 million, or 91 cents, a year ago, beating the average estimate of $1.00 a share, based on a survey of 19 analysts by IBES International.
Revenue rose 11 percent, to $3.74 billion from $3.37 billion. Ameritech shares rose 75 cents, to $57.75, in Big Board trading yesterday.
The results were aided by a 4.2 percent increase in phone lines to 19.4 million from 18.6 million. The company also posted a 9.3 percent increase in volume on its local phone network.
Meanwhile, Ameritech kept a lid on costs. Total expenses rose 10 percent, to $2.85 billion from $2.59 billion, below the 17.3 percent increase for the first half of 1996 to $5.67 billion.
Ameritech also maintained its lead among the Bells in the number of phone lines per employee, a key measure of efficiency in the industry, with 372, up from 359 a year ago. Further, cellular customers increased to 2.2 million from 1.6 million a year earlier.

HEADLINE: A WILD DAY ON WALL STREET: THE FOREIGN STOCKS;
A Tremor On Wall St. Reverberates Overseas

 BODY:
The rest of the world didn't stand a chance.
Monday's bloodbath on Wall Street spread around the globe yesterday, overwhelming stock exchanges on a westward-bound rampage: Sydney, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Bombay, Tel Aviv, Johannesburg, Vienna, Oslo, Frankfurt, Milan, Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, London, Madrid. 
 Though the declines were generally less severe than in the United States -- and while there were pockets of resistance to the downdraft -- the selloff was unmistakably a panicky reaction to the Wall Street carnage. "It's impossible for European markets to avoid following on the coattails of the U.S. market," Roger Mondon, chief equity strategist at Daiwa Europe Ltd. in London, told Bloomberg Business News.
Western Europe, at least, experienced a flicker of hope when, at the start of the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average spurted up more than 40 points in the first few minutes of trading -- even while Europe's markets were still open.
But then the Dow turned south, and European stocks also got hammered by a weakening dollar that cast a cloud over the earnings prospects of export-oriented companies.
An early sign yesterday that Wall Street's Monday swoon would take other stock markets with it came when Australia's All Ordinaries index slumped 2.17 percent. Though less than either the Dow's 2.9 percent dip or the Nasdaq composite index's 3.9 percent plunge on Monday, the decline dragged the Australian index to its lowest point in more than seven months. "Mums and dads are hitting the panic button," David England, a trader with BT Securities, told Bloomberg.
Then it was Tokyo's turn, and the world's second-biggest exchange didn't even put up a fight. Today, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks rose 6.53 points, or 0.03 percent, to close at 21,412.88. Yesterday the index dropped 347.07 points to 21,406.35, mostly in the first few minutes of trading. Aside from the fall in American stocks, analysts said, Japanese investors feared a further retreat by Americans from mutual funds that have been pouring money into Japanese stocks, and worried that the Federal Reserve Board would raise interest rates in the United States, putting pressure on the Bank of Japan to follow suit. Even so, some analysts remained upbeat, noting that Japanese stocks tend to move independently of the American market over the long term and suggesting they might get a lift later this year as the Japanese economy continues to recover from a slump.
Technology stocks -- the same sector that led the American market down -- were some of the hardest hit in Japan. The electronics industries of the two nations are highly interdependent, and announcements in the United States of poorer-than-expected earnings by Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, Applied Materials and other companies heralded bleaker prospects for their rivals and suppliers in Japan, analysts said.
Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong stocks hit a two-month low, with the Hang Seng index off by 1.59 percent. Benchmark indexes were down 1.8 percent in India, 0.98 percent in Indonesia, 0.94 percent in Malaysia and 0.58 percent in Thailand.
Two Asian exchanges bucked the trend: the Korea Composite Index declined by an insignificant two-tenths of 1 percent, albeit to a 30-month low, and Singapore's Straits Times Industrials Index, which has fallen more than 6 percent since June 1, slipped by a minuscule six-hundredths of 1 percent.
In a preview of the action ahead in the main trading centers of Europe, stocks fell by about 5 percent in Israel, 3.3 percent in Hungary, 2.2 percent in Poland, 2.6 percent in South Africa and 1.8 percent in Austria. "It's a pure knee-jerk reaction," Robin Gardy, a trader at Frankel Pollak in Johannesburg, told Bloomberg. "There's no reason our market should fall like this."
In Western Europe, the selloff continued with benchmark indexes sinking more than 2 percent in Italy, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, and more than 1.5 percent elsewhere. Shares in export-oriented stocks sank as the dollar fell to a three-month low against the German mark, crashing through the psychologically important 1.50-mark barrier, from 1.52 marks late Monday in Europe to less than 1.49 marks by midday Tuesday in New York.
Leading their respective markets lower, SAP A.G., a German software maker, plunged 5.93 percent, the French aerospace and electronics company Thomson CSF slumped 5.40 percent, and Ericsson A.B., a Swedish telecommunications company, declined 4.06 percent.
While a bad day for stocks, yesterday was a good day for British understatement, and Tim O'Dell, a stock strategist at UBS Ltd. in London, provided some. "Today's been a bit of a disappointment," he told The Associated Press.

HEADLINE: Industrial Output Gains, And Inflation Stays Low

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
The economy remained healthy and balanced last month, displaying solid gains in industrial production and no signs of surging inflation, the Government reported today.
The benign data -- contained in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index and the Federal Reserve's industrial output survey -- provided a calming counterpoint on Wall Street to the rash of lower-than-expected corporate earnings announcements that helped to send stock prices gyrating. 
 The reports were characterized by the Clinton Administration as further evidence that the economy was performing as well as it had in decades, with steady growth and low inflation. And while economists predicted that the pace of growth would slow as the year progressed, they said the economy remained nearly free of the kinds of bottlenecks that could derail the expansion.
"What could be better than an economy that is growing at a relatively fast clip, with lots of jobs being created, yet with very little in the way of inflationary consequences?" said Edward Yardeni, an economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C.J. Lawrence Inc.
Today's news did not totally dampen speculation that the Federal Reserve would push interest rates up later this summer to forestall the possibility of a wage and price spiral farther down the road. The Fed is expected to scrutinize a number of economic indicators at the end of this month and early next month, including employment costs and job growth, before deciding whether a rate increase is warranted.
Today's reports, said Joel L. Naroff, an economist at the First Union Bank in Philadelphia, provided "not a whiff of rising inflation."
The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index inched up one-tenth of 1 percent in June, slightly below the expectations of most economists and down from its increase of three-tenths of a percent in May. For the last 12 months, inflation at the consumer level rose 2.8 percent, roughly consistent with its trend of the last several years.
Excluding its most volatile components, food and energy, the inflation index was up two-tenths of a percent last month and at a 2.7 percent annual pace for the last 12 months.
The report showed that energy prices, which had shot up this spring, fell 2.2 percent in June. Included in the energy price drop was a 3.2 percent decline in gasoline prices, whose rise earlier this year prompted a frenzied election-year political response, including a Republican proposal to rescind the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax and an effort by the Clinton Administration to nudge down oil prices by selling some of the nation's petroleum reserves. At the same time, food prices shot up seven-tenths of a percent during the month, with meat, poultry, dairy and produce prices all sharply higher.
Inflation would normally be expected to increase when the economy is growing at a strong rate and the unemployment rate is low, since companies would normally try to pass on the resultant rise in wage rates to consumers in the form of higher prices. But the June inflation numbers were muted despite a strong rise in industrial production at a time when the unemployment, at 5.3 percent, was at a six-year low.
The Federal Reserve said industrial production increased five-tenths of a percent in June, somewhat higher than most projections. At the same time, however, the Fed revised its estimate of industrial production in May down to five-tenths of a percent from seven-tenths.
While industrial production continued to grow at a strong clip in June, it did not appear to strain the ability of factories, mines and utilities to keep up with demand. The Fed reported that the capacity utilization for the month stood at 83.2 percent of potential output, still below the 85 percent that most economists believe signals potential inflationary bottlenecks.
The Labor Department reported that real average weekly earnings rose 2.2 percent from May to June. The increase was caused by what the Bureau of Labor Statistics said was an "unusual combination" of a 1.5 percent increase in hours worked and an increase of eight-tenths of a percent in average hourly earnings.
Economists and traders are now turning their attention to testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, on Thursday before the Senate Banking Committee.
In particular, they will be looking for clues as to how the Fed is resolving the debate over whether the economy is more capable of sustaining noninflationary growth than previous rules of thumb suggested. Not only have economists been forced to rethink their assumptions about the relationship between unemployment and inflation, they have also had to question whether rapid changes in technology and business practices have left them unable to measure improvements in such key gauges as productivity and capacity.
Wall Street will also be looking for signals that the Fed, after the volatility of the last few days on Wall Street, may be concerned about a sharp downturn in the stock market and its effect on the broader economy and on monetary policy. A steep downturn in the market could leave individual investors feeling poorer and cause them to rein in their spending. A crash in prices could force the Fed to keep monetary policy looser than it might otherwise, as it did during and after the market tailspin in October 1987, to insure adequate liquidity.
At the same time, analysts will be watching for any indication that the Fed is willing to hold its fire on inflation this year, at a time when the economy seems to be humming along, and save its ammunition for the next cyclical downturn or upward spike in inflation.
Since The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that two Fed economists conducted a mathematical review of that approach, known as "opportunistic disinflation," some analysts concluded that the Fed was sending a signal that it would not raise rates this summer.
But other economists said the "opportunistic disinflation" approach was by no means new, and indeed was the signature of Mr. Greenspan's nine-year tenure at the central bank. In Congressional testimony in February, Mr. Greenspan said "keeping inflation from rising significantly during economic expansions will permit a gradual ratcheting down of inflation over the course of successive business cycles" -- a formulation that implied that progress on inflation during downturns.

HEADLINE: In Shift, U.S. Will Seek Binding World Pact to Combat Global Warming

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
For the first time, the United States will seek a binding international agreement to reduce the kinds of air pollution, chiefly from burning fossil fuels, that threaten to warm the global climate, Administration officials said today.
Endorsing the view that the buildup of so-called greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, mainly carbon dioxide, is probably already beginning to warm the planet, the Administration will urge the world's nations to adopt, by the end of next year, "realistic, verifiable and binding" targets for reversing the trend. 
 Although the Administration has devised no specific target or timetable, its position signals a more aggressive campaign against climate change than the voluntary measures it endorsed in the past, and puts it on a course that promises to be politically difficult.
Environmentalists praised the new approach, but officials of the energy industry reacted skeptically, although they said the impact of the plan would depend on the specific goals, which have not been spelled out.
The United States, with its huge appetite for energy, burns more fossil fuels than any other country in the world and its output of greenhouse gases has continued to rise despite conservation measures. Proposals for the stringent measures that would be required to reduce emissions have been politically explosive.
"This is a big deal," said Timothy E. Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for Global Affairs, in a telephone interview from Geneva. On Wednesday he is scheduled to present the American position at a negotiating session among some 150 nations who signed the 1992 treaty on climate change.
"Saying that we want to have a target that is binding is a clear indication that the United States is very serious about taking steps and leading the rest of the world," he said. "We will be getting more and more specific as the next year and a half rolls through."
The Geneva talks are a prelude to a conference in Tokyo late next year where the signers of the treaty plan to set forth the next steps in heading off worldwide climate change.
The Administration would have preferred to wait until after the election before introducing tougher measures, but the diplomatic timetable would not allow that.
In the treaty, negotiated in Rio de Janeiro during the Bush Administration, industrial countries set a non-binding goal of limiting emissions of greenhouse gases by 2000 to the levels that prevailed in 1990. But the United States and most other countries are unlikely to meet that goal, and have since conceded that even deeper cuts in pollution are needed.
In remarks prepared for delivery by Mr. Wirth on Wednesday, the United States rejects some proposals for steep and immediate cuts in pollution, such as the 20 percent cut within a decade that is being sought by small island nations fearful of being swamped by rising oceans as the planet warms.
Mr. Wirth will call that goal unrealistic, given the economic disruption that would occur if energy consumption were restricted so sharply. A copy of his prepared text was obtained by The New York Times today.
He will also say that the United States wants flexibility to allow every country to meet the new targets in whatever way seems best to each government, and he signaled that the Administration intends to use market-based approaches, like the trading of pollution permits, to help its industries do so in whatever fashion they deem most efficient.
Those positions seemed intended to deflect some of the political fallout from industry groups that have strongly opposed strict new measures to combat global warming. The Administration in the past has adopted purely voluntary approaches, which have cut the growth in pollution but have failed to actually reduce emissions.
John Schlaes, executive director of an industry group that opposes quick action to head off global warming, said that the key to the Administration's proposals would lie in details of the timing and extent of any emission reductions that are to be sought. His group, the Global Climate Coalition, is made up of oil, coal and electric companies and industries that use large amounts of energy.
"Any kind of binding target, without doing the appropriate analysis and assessment, and then having a dialogue with the American public, doesn't make sense," he said in a telephone interview from Geneva, where he is observing the negotiations.
Environmental groups generally reacted positively to the Administration's position, although not all of them favor the market-based approach that Mr. Wirth mentioned.
"It shows that the Administration is serious about this issue," said Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist who is a senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund in New York. "It shows that they have accepted the judgment of the scientific community that climate change is happening and that something has to be done about it."
In his prepared remarks, Mr. Wirth calls for quick action, not decades of delay, and for concrete measures, not vague promises, in the binding measures that would be negotiated in time for the meeting scheduled in Tokyo at the end of next year.
"We are not interested in grand rhetorical goals that are impossible to realize," he says in his speech. "We want the negotiations to focus on outcomes that are real and achievable."
Mr. Wirth and other senior leaders are expected to issue a joint statement of policy on Thursday, joined by many nations, and a key test for the Administration is the extent to which its views are incorporated into that statement.
Although his statement is cautious about what steps to take next, it is unequivocal in calling the efforts to date a failure. "We have to do better," it says bluntly.
The Administration had held its negotiating stance close to the vest in recent weeks, officials said, partly to avoid heavy criticism from industries that contend that acting precipitously will do economic damage.
Mr. Wirth said today that those critics, who have also attacked the scientific work supporting the theory of global warming, are "bent upon destroying" the climate treaty.

HEADLINE: Clinton Grants, Then Suspends, Right to Sue Foreigners on Cuba

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
Seeking to weave his way between conflicting domestic and foreign pressures, President Clinton today granted American citizens the right to sue foreign companies that are using American plants seized by Cuba over 35 years ago, but he immediately suspended those suits for at least six months.
Mr. Clinton's election-year compromise, his aides said, was an effort to demonstrate that he is eager to tighten the economic noose around Fidel Castro while defusing the criticism at home and the threats of retaliation from the European Union, Canada and Mexico. 
 Those countries have accused the United States of using threats of legal judgments against foreign companies to force other governments into helping to isolate Mr. Castro. Those countries have vowed to impose equal penalties against American companies, especially after Mr. Clinton moved last week to deny visas to executives and major shareholders of the foreign companies.
By delaying the legal actions, Mr. Clinton puts off that conflict until after the elections in November. Meanwhile, he can argue in Florida and New Jersey, two key electoral states with large Cuban-American populations, that he is working to speed the collapse of Mr. Castro's Communist Government.
Administration officials conceded that Mr. Clinton's action today, taken hours before a midnight deadline set by the Helms-Burton law, was a muddled outcome to a highly charged issue.
"This was classic Clinton," one of his top aides said after the President sought recommendations from his Cabinet in a late-night meeting Monday at the White House. "It's creative, but it runs the risk of looking like a waffle."
The move was immediately criticized as such by Bob Dole, the President's likely Republican opponent in November. "President Clinton's continued indecision until the last possible moment demonstrates, once again, that this President is rudderless when it comes to standing up for American principles around the world," Mr. Dole said.
Even with delayed enforcement, the measure could still have a real impact, Clinton aides said. The prospect of litigation is likely to discourage foreign companies from risking investment in Cuba, cutting off one of Mr. Castro's few sources of new capital -- selling Cuba's decrepit infrastructure.
Mr. Clinton's aides insisted today that by delaying the suits, they have six months to convince the Europeans to act to isolate Mr. Castro, or risk a decision by the White House to let the lawsuits go forward.
"If we had allowed the suits today, it would begin a cycle of retaliation and counter-retaliation with our allies that would divert attention from the primary issue: Fidel Castro," said Sandy Berger, the deputy national security adviser, who pressed Mr. Clinton on Monday night to take this course. "Now, we have the means to focus their minds."
But if the action was intended to end the criticism from abroad that Washington was being an economic bully, it was not immediately successful.
Britain said today that it would consider restrictions on visas for American citizens. This was a direct response to the decision a week ago to ban several Britons from entering the United States because they are major shareholders in companies that "traffic" in American properties that were nationalized by Cuba after Castro and the Communists came to power in 1959.
The Helms-Burton law, passed by Congress and signed by the President last March after Cuba shot down two small planes piloted by anti-Castro demonstrators, defines "trafficking" so broadly that it even covers Mexican and Italian companies that have taken over Cuba's crumbling telephone system, parts of which were built by the ITT Corporation in the 1950's.
Canada said today that it would go ahead with legislation giving Canadian companies the right to retaliate if American courts penalize them for using equipment in Cuba that once belonged to ITT and to American mining companies.
"The situation remains exactly as it did yesterday," Reuters quoted a spokesman for the European Commission as saying. "European companies still have the threat of legal action against them."
Mr. Dole, however, was critical from the opposite point of view. "Allowing American citizens whose property was illegally stolen by the Castro regime to use American courts to seek justice is the right thing to do," he said.
Several of Mr. Clinton's economic advisers argued in the Oval Office on Monday night that the President should use his powers to waive entirely the section of the Helms-Burton law that gives American citizens the right to sue.
They were concerned, they said, that the law itself sets a precedent that could boomerang on American companies: It establishes an "extraterritorial" law, punishing, for example, Canadian companies for their activities in a third country. Washington condemned such actions during the Arab boycott of American companies that did business with Israel, arguing that such actions amount to blackmail.
For that reason, Mr. Clinton initially opposed the Helms-Burton bill. But when the Cuban-Americans' aircraft were shot down in February, he signed the legislation over the objections of some foreign-policy advisers.
In recent months, carrying out the bill has become an issue of enormous political sensitivity. Cuban-Americans are a relatively small constituency, but they are highly influential in two hotly contested states.
"They are very disappointed, and so am I," said Representative Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, the Democratic candidate for the Senate seat being vacated by Bill Bradley. "The Castro Government is weaker than it is perceived, and this was a chance to bring an end to that Government."
Mr. Clinton has also been seeking a way to deflect Mr. Dole's criticism that he is coddling a Communist neighbor, even if Cuba represents little threat to American security.
The problem has been that the United States is alone in its strategy of economically isolating Cuba, in hopes of speeding the collapse of the Castro Government. Europe and Canada argue that Cuba should be treated much as Washington treats China -- with economic engagement intended to slowly bring about reform. Years of arguments between Washington and its allies over this strategy with Cuba have failed to narrow their differences.
"I think that the U.S. is totally isolated on this one," Lloyd Axworthy, Canada's Foreign Minister, said last week. "Cuba has actually changed a great deal, though Washington will not easily acknowledge that."
In the days before Mr. Clinton made the decision, pressure mounted from overseas to delay the suits or prevent them altogether. The European Union threatened retaliatory steps that it knew would alarm large multinational corporations that have little interest in Cuba or its market, but that have much at stake in Europe and Canada.
The allies threatened to bring the United States before the World Trade Organization, and to order their own courts not to enforce judgments against companies that emanated from the United States.
Mr. Clinton decided today to appoint a special envoy, who has yet to be named, to try to convince America's European allies to change their view. The envoy, Mr. Berger said, would try to get cooperation in providing assistance to human rights groups, dissidents and journalists in Cuba, as the Administration did recently when it granted $500,000 to Free House, a human rights group.
The allies will also be urged to withhold economic assistance and to promote a code of business practices similar to the Sullivan principles, which companies operating in South Africa in the era of apartheid were asked to subscribe to in an effort to assure nondiscriminatory hiring.

HEADLINE: A WILD DAY ON WALL STREET: STORM CLOUDS GATHER OVER WALL STREET -- THE LAST WILD TIME;
How 1996 Is Like 1987, and How It Isn't

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
If investors were holding their breath yesterday, it was with good reason.
As the historically minded -- or superstitious -- might recall, in 1929 the stock market peaked and then, 55 days later, crashed. In 1987, the stock market peaked and then, 55 days later, crashed. And in 1996, the stock market peaked and then, 55 days later . . . 
 Ended almost unchanged. Yes, yesterday was another Day 55 for the Dow Jones industrial average, which topped out on May 22 at 5,778 points. And after Monday's 161-point plunge in the Dow, a decline that the index matched early yesterday, investors could be forgiven for thinking that history might just be repeating itself. In the end, though, the Dow gained 9.25 points, to 5,358.76, a rise of less than two-tenths of 1 percent.
Faced with wild days like yesterday, investors and analysts naturally look to the past for clues about what is happening today, and will happen tomorrow. In particular, the last big debacle in the stock market -- the crash of 1987 -- looms large in the minds of everyone who lived through it.
To be sure, there are significant differences between the summer of 1987 and this one, in both the economy and the stock market. But, according to some market gurus, some parallels exist:
*Skyrocketing stock prices, coming atop several strong years. By the time of the crash of 1987, the market had gone more than three years without falling by 10 percent -- a record at the time. This time around, stocks have climbed steadily for more than five years. In both cases, the Dow zoomed about 150 percent.
*Sky-high valuations, especially when the stock prices of companies are compared with their earnings. At the peak in 1987, stocks in the Dow traded for about 24 times their average earnings over five years, according to data from the Leuthold Group, a research firm in Minneapolis. At the end of June of this year, the ratio of prices to earnings was 23.1. To put that in perspective: since 1926, the ratio has tended to average about 15.
*A torrent of companies clamoring to sell shares to the public, resulting in a heavy calendar of initial public offerings. In the last 12 months, about 800 companies have raised $47.6 billion, more than double the previous year's activity. For the year ending Oct. 31, 1987, more than 700 companies raised in excess of $24.2 billion, almost double the level of the prior year.
*Heavy participation by small investors, especially those investing in mutual funds. The current fund boom has been building since 1992. And investors in 1987 had a boomlet of their own, pouring record sums into mutual funds.
Indeed, the numbers in 1987 form a pattern a lot like this year's: In January 1987, $5.9 billion flooded into stock funds -- at the time, the biggest month ever for funds. Fund purchases slowed a bit later in the year, totaling about $2.8 billion in August, when the market peaked.
Today, the inflow from individual investors, especially those saving for retirement, "dwarfs every other consideration" in market performance, said Steven C. Leuthold, who runs the research and money management firm. "The most important factors by far are mutual-fund flows and public confidence."
The latest numbers? Americans put more money into stock funds in the first six months of 1996 than in any previous full year, but they cut back their net buys substantially in June. Some big fund companies reported more redemptions from stock funds than purchases over the last two days.
*A sudden change in investor sentiment after the peak. This is the hardest to document, but some analysts say they are starting to see it. "There has been a shift, though it is almost invisible, from fear of being left behind to fear of losing one's behind," said James B. Stack, editor of Investech Market Analyst, a newsletter based in Whitefish, Mont. Mr. Stack, who has been bearish for some time, said he thinks investors are moving "from buying on dips to the desire to sell into rallies."
*Sudden poor performance after a market peak by stocks that trade over the counter. Recently, the number of over-the-counter stocks hitting new lows has far outpaced those hitting new highs, Mr. Stack said, a measure of the depth of the market's problems. The plunge in the ratio of advancing stocks versus declining stocks, which Wall Steet often calls breadth, is the steepest since right before the '87 crash, he said.
But the action in smaller stocks is also among the salient differences between then and now, analysts said:
*In 1987, big stocks were far more in favor than their smaller brethren, the reverse of conditions this year. Then, the blue-chip issues that make up the Dow outperformed both the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index.
Yet when the crash came, it was the Nasdaq that really got clobbered. This year, the Nasdaq moved far ahead of the indexes of bigger stocks before falling back to earth. Early last month, the Nasdaq was up 18.7 percent, versus 11.3 percent for the Dow; as of yesterday, the Nasdaq had eked out a gain of just one tenth of 1 percent this year, while the Dow is still up 4.7 percent.
Some analysts suggest that the recent declines may amount to a wringing out of excess in high-technology issues, which make up a large part of the Nasdaq and which have been the magnet attracting speculators this year. If so, the broader stock market may not fare so badly going forward.
*Conditions in the bond market are much more favorable for stocks. In 1987, the stock market rose even while the bond market plunged; yields, which move in the opposite direction from bond prices, soared by three percentage points. "It was absolutely, categorically impossible for both markets to be correct," said Robert J. Barbera, co-chairman of Capital Investments International Inc. This time, bond yields have risen by only one percentage point, and the recent decline in the stock market, he said, "is a more traditional and orderly repricing as a consequence of higher interest rates and lower" price-to-earnings ratios.
*The dollar is now relatively strong, while in 1987 it was in freefall. Today's stronger dollar carries its own worries -- mainly, that it will damage the sales and profits of American exporters, notably those of big durable-goods makers represented in the Dow.
*The economy in general is much stronger now than it was back then, at least in the view of Byron R. Wien, director of U.S. portfolio strategy at Morgan Stanley. Though Mr. Wien is a market bear, he said that "the fundamental background is very different. The American economy is fine, and the U.S. is in a much better competitive position than it was."
*It is a Presidential election year. And that may be the most important difference of all. While no one knows exactly why, there seems to be a four-year cycle in the economy and the stock market, according to Marc M. Groz, president of the Quaternion Group, a research firm in New York. And since 1941, the stock market has risen in the third and fourth years of every president's administration.
Of course, history is no sure guide, as the failure of the 55-day pattern proves. But sometimes it bears review.

INTEREST RATES -- In 1987, the yield on 30-year bonds rose 272 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 10.17% from Jan. 1 to the October market crash, offering stock investors a rewarding alternative. This year, yields have moved up ust 108 basis points, to 7.02%
 
THE DOLLAR -- In 1987, the dollar was weakening against key currencies, raising fears about inflation and a breakdown in the global trading system. This year, the dollar is strengthening, raising worries about the profitablility of U.S. exports.
 
VOLATILITY -- In 1987, there was no system in place to limit huge market swings, and computerized trading programs accelerated selloffs. Now, "circuit breakers" on both the stock and futures exchanges prevent freefalls, giving opportunistic investors time to buy on midday dips.

WASHINGTON -- Alan Greenspan, who had just taken over as Federal Reserve chairman in the summer of 1987, immediately raised interest rates to slow the economy and demonstrate his inflation-fighting resolve. Now, after winning a third four-year term, Mr. Greenspan may be more circumspect -- particularly since 1996 is an election year. (pg. D1)

HEADLINE: Netanyahu, Home, Finds Honeymoon Is Waning

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 16

 BODY:
Fresh from an American tour and boasting that Washington did not try to "twist my arm," Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has returned to new pressures at home, and is bracing for some arm-twisting by his Arab neighbors.
Upon his return, Mr. Netanyahu was greeted by withering criticism from his predecessor, Shimon Peres, and a call by Israel's umbrella labor federation for a general strike on Wednesday. And as Mr. Netanyahu heads to Cairo on Thursday for his first face-to-face encounter with an Arab head of state since he became Prime Minister, even his supporters have warned that he has a difficult mission ahead. 
 In a gesture that might appease some of his critics, Mr. Netanyahu's Government said today that it had decided in principle to ease a 19-week blockade of Gaza and the West Bank that has kept tens of thousands of Palestinians from their jobs.
But the Cabinet announcement did not spell out what steps the Government would take, and it did not say whether those steps would be contingent on further action by the Palestinians. And a bleaker measure of that relationship became evident tonight when Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, refused to meet with an envoy of Mr. Netanyahu, Dore Gold.
Mr. Peres, whom Mr. Netanyahu defeated in the May election, broke a public silence on Monday night when he told fellow Labor Party members that the new Prime Minister's first official trip had "been in the wrong direction in every sense of the word."
Maariv, a newspaper generally sympathetic to Mr. Netanyahu, has warned that the new Prime Minister cannot "rest on the laurels" of his trip to the United States and must address problems at home, including a controversy over his plans to reduce Government spending by more than 3 percent in the year ahead.
It is to protest that proposal that Histadrut, the labor federation that strongly supported the previous Labor Government, has called a general strike for Wednesday, the first in several years. And broader uncertainty over the new Government's course, even among Mr. Netanyahu's supporters, has contributed to a plunge on the Tel Aviv stock exchange, where the average share price has fallen more than 20 percent since he took office.
More than a month after he took office, Mr. Netanyahu has still not said even whether he intends to withdraw Israeli soldiers from the West Bank town of Hebron, a step required under the 1993 accord between Israel and the Palestinians and one on which he is certain to be pressed on Thursday when he meets with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
Mr. Netanyahu's visit to Cairo comes after weeks of warnings, in increasingly sharp language, from Arab leaders who want him to stay on the road toward peace that Mr. Peres was pursuing.
Over the weekend, eight Arab foreign ministers meeting in Oman issued a statement expressing "deep concern" at remarks made by Mr. Netanyahu that underscored his opposition to trading land for peace with Syria, to the establishment of a Palestinian state and to negotiations about the future of Jerusalem. In addition, Qatar announced that it was postponing a plan to open a trade office in Tel Aviv.
Mr. Mubarak, whose country made peace with Israel 17 years ago, has never met Mr. Netanyahu, but has so far been mostly muted in his criticism of Israel's new Prime Minister. He has said that he intends to devote Thursday's meeting to a "heart-to-heart talk" in an attempt to learn more about Mr. Netanyahu's intentions.
But both Israeli and Egyptian officials have signaled that they expect the session to be anything but gentle, and Mr. Netanyahu has taken an uncompromising line in accusing the Arab leaders of being disappointed over what he described as American "understanding" of his position.
"There's rhetoric and there's reality," Mr. Netanyahu said as he returned to Jerusalem on Sunday night. "I call on Arab leaders to drop the rhetoric, to return to the solid ground of reality."
In a diplomatic crunch leading up to the Cairo meeting, the Jordanian Prime Minister, Abdul Karim al-Kabariti, on his way home from Egypt, made an unscheduled stop in Tel Aviv tonight to meet with Mr. Netanyahu. "I sense that there is a sincere commitment from Prime Minister Netanyahu when it comes to making peace," Mr. Kabariti said after talks with the Israeli leader.
Not all of the attention that Mr. Netanyahu's five-day trip to the United States received in Israel was favorable.
Even some who support Mr. Netanyahu's hard-line stance on the terms for a broader peace have questioned his judgment in telling Congress that he would ultimately go along with a reduction in the package of $3 billion in economic assistance that the United States provides each year to Israel.

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Agreement Reached Regarding Chemicals in Foods

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 16

 BODY:
A bipartisan group of House members said today that they had reached agreement on a compromise pesticide bill that would guard consumers against dangerous chemicals in food while ending what they described as an outdated law that threatened to keep many useful substances away from growers.
The bill would repeal 1958 legislation known as the Delaney clause, which bans any cancer-causing residues in processed foods, like raisins or ketchup, if the residues concentrate higher than in raw foods. Some levels of cancer-causing ingredients are allowed in raw foods like apples and tomatoes. 
 Under the agreement, the legislation would allow only pesticide residues that pose a "reasonable certainty of no harm." That is understood to mean creating a lifetime risk of developing cancer of no more than one in one million -- tougher than the current standard for raw commodities.
The bill would create a single standard for regulating all pesticides in foods, replacing the current system that has different standards for raw and processed foods. The legislation would also let the standard be loosened in rare cases where a crop might be threatened.
Moreover, the bill forces regulators to weigh the special risks of cancer, damage to the nervous system and other harm caused by exposure of children and infants to pesticides, incorporating recommendations made in 1993 by the National Academy of Sciences. It also requires the Government to weigh the risk of breast cancer and reproductive harm in women.
The Environmental Protection Agency had been faced with banning pesticide uses on raw produce so that it could carry out bans on processed foods. Environmentalists and others sued and won in 1988, when the E.P.A. tried to work around the standard, which was created when the ability to detect cancer-causing ingredients was limited.
Scientists can now detect residues in amounts far lower than what is permitted.
As a result of the law, the environmental agency has begun singling out pesticide uses for cancellation. Chemical companies were not seeking approval for newer, possibly safer pesticides that still carried a small cancer risk.
After the agreement, Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the House Commerce Committee, said, "For the first time, we will be able to address the issue of food safety comprehensively, taking into account the safety of the consuming public, preservation of the food supply and economic benefits as well."

HEADLINE: A WILD DAY ON WALL STREET: THE MARKET;
Stocks on Roller Coaster, But Finish Little Changed

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
The stock market rode out the busiest day in its 204-year history yesterday, and the wildest day since the 1987 market plunge, to end basically unchanged.
As the closing bell sounded at 4 P.M., the Dow Jones industrial average reported a gain of 9.25 points -- that is less than two-tenths of 1 percent -- to close at 5,358.76. This came after stocks dropped sharply on Monday, scaring investors and causing the market to open uneasily yesterday on fears that the plunge would snowball. 
 But it did not. Still, investors were treated to a roller coaster ride in which the Dow, after rising briefly, plunged by 212 points and then climbed 219 before stabilizing in the heaviest trading day ever. These swings occurred for no clear reason -- the wrenching midday plunge was followed by an equally stunning rise as bargain-hunters stepped in to push prices up again.
And technology stocks, which had soared in the first half of the year, continued to face heavy battering, although many began to rise at day's end as news leaked out that the Intel Corporation, a bellwether semiconductor company, would report strong earnings after the market's close. The technology-heavy Nasdaq market, as measured by its composite index, fell by 6.72 points, or about six-tenths of 1 percent, to close at 1,053.47 -- about where it opened for the year.
Mutual fund companies began to report a modest level of redemptions as small investors began to leave the market. [Page D1.] As buyers and sellers flooded the markets with orders, volume records were broken on the New York Stock Exchange, where a historic 683 million shares changed hands, and on the Nasdaq market, where a record 877 million shares were traded. This frenzy was a reflection of genuine confusion in the marketplace as investors wondered where stocks would head next.
Even the experts were baffled. "The reason is . . . who knows?" said Byron Wien, an investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "Some people say the economy is too strong, and others say it is slowing."
Prices in New York stood in sharp contrast to the dismal performance of shares on other world exchanges yesterday. Taking their cue from the Monday plunge in New York, stocks in Tokyo, London and everywhere in between suffered declines.
If Monday's market was dominated by concerns about falling corporate profits, yesterday's market had no clear force behind it. This, analysts say, reflects a belief that worries about falling corporate profits may be overblown and that investors are still uncertain about whether the market has switched to bearish.
"It has begun to sink in to investors that corporate earnings are really no worse now than at this stage in the last quarter," said Christine Callief, an equity strategist at the CS First Boston Corporation. "The heavy volume is a ray of sunshine. It suggests that when investors sell stocks, they are finding buyers. There's a lot of traffic on both sides."
Yesterday actually opened with good economic news. The Government reported that consumer prices edged up just a tenth of a percent in June, the best inflation performance since November. And industrial production rose five-tenths of a percent last month, a healthy gain. Some of the market's recent drop has been caused by concerns that the Federal Reserve, amid fears of an overheating economy, would begin to push up interest rates to stave off inflation, which would cause investors to shift from buying stocks to buying bonds.
Also on the bright side, two large industrial companies, Caterpillar and Eastman Kodak, reported better-than-expected earnings yesterday, and operating profits were also up at General Motors and Merrill Lynch. I.B.M. and Microsoft began to trade up at day's end on word of the strong Intel earnings.
Yesterday's wild ride started after the Government's positive economic report quickly sent the Dow up 45 points. But then it plunged, with the index off 166.73 at its lowest. From there it soared by 219 points before falling back to close ahead of Monday's final price by 9.25 points. Both the downward plunge and the upward ride set off "circuit breakers" which temporarily halted trading both on Wall Street and in the futures market in Chicago to limit computer-guided programs and give the market breathing room.
Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers Inc., said the volatility reflected "an immense amount of uncertainty."
"Either we are working through a modest correction in a bull cycle, or we've got a lot more correction ahead," Mr. Applegate said. "I still think there is life in this market."
Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research at Merrill Lynch, added: "People seem to have no firm convictions positive or negative. They can't figure it out. When you have big moves in the market, you have that."
Life was eerily normal on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, where technological advances have allowed for the faster spread of information and made it easier for traders to move more shares. This is in sharp contrast to the 1987 one-day market plunge, when prices ran up to three hours late. "Everything remained orderly, even though there was more volume than 1987," said Willis P. Benedict 3d, a floor trader. "There was never a sense of panic."
The shadow of an uncertain market hung over all of Wall Street yesterday, especially at investment firms that specialize in raising money for technology companies. A robust stock market has lead to a frantic market for initial public offerings. Now, as the market gyrates daily and wobbles downward, many of those plans are being postponed.
"We're in a period of watchful waiting," said Terrence Connelly, head of investment banking at Cowen & Company. "The market seems to have caught a virus here, and the question is we don't know how serious it is. It's time for cautiousness and prudence and a number of issues we had going to the market are now delayed."

Crude Oil Prices Fall as U.S. Hints Iraq Has Met Conditions

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Crude oil prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday on signs that the United States would not object to Iraq's revised plan for distributing humanitarian aid bought with the proceeds of a limited oil sale. Comments from a United States official led traders to speculate that Iraqi oil was nearer to coming to market.
On other markets, corn prices tumbled. 
 While United States officials had called earlier versions of Iraq's distribution plan unacceptable, comments yesterday from Edward W. Gnehm Jr., deputy representative to the United Nations, suggested to traders that Iraq had largely met the United States' objections.
Approval of the plan is one of the last steps remaining before Iraq can begin selling as much as $2 billion of oil during a six-month period under an agreement reached with the United Nations in May.
"The U.S. is apparently getting closer to approving the Iraqi distribution plan," said Hugo Zagaria, a trader at Cargill Northeast Petroleum in Beverly, Mass. "That may mean the oil is getting closer, and that's why the market is down."
The United Nations sanctions committee must still approve guidelines for exporting the oil, though the group appears close to an agreement, a United Nations spokesman said. And the United Nations must set up a variety of monitors to oversee the actual oil production and exports and the distribution of aid.
Crude oil for August delivery tumbled 58 cents, to $21.80 a barrel.
Corn and soybean prices plunged for a second day as plentiful rains across western crop regions eased the stress of dry soil conditions.
As much as an inch of rain fell across at least half the nation's corn fields last night, traders said. The rains come after dry weather threatened the crop's condition. The size of the crop is particularly important since the Agriculture Department predicts only 322 million bushels of corn will be left in storage as of Aug. 31, the lowest in almost 50 years.
Corn for December delivery fell 12.25 cents, to $3.55 a bushel, at the Chicago Board of Trade while November soybeans dropped 15.5 cents, to $7.78 a bushel.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains a Bit in Europe But Loses Ground Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar failed to regain much ground yesterday, despite a relatively stable day on Wall Street, rising a bit in Europe but eroding further against the yen on talk of higher interest rates in Japan.
Many currency traders were reluctant to buy or sell the dollar until they could get a better sense of the American stock market. 
 The dollar fell sharply on Tuesday in a day of wild price swings in the stock market. Stocks strengthened yesterday, but the improvement did not rejuvenate demand for dollars.
"Everyone is just sort of sitting back and licking their wounds," said Roger Chapin, foreign exchange manager at Bank One Columbus, a regional bank in Columbus, Ohio.
In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.4857 German marks, up from its three-and-a-half-month low of 1.4806 marks on Tuesday. The dollar fell to 108.68 Japanese yen from 109.25 yen. The British pound declined to $1.5455 from $1.5595.
Traders partly attributed the dollar's strength in Europe to remarks by Ernst Welteke, a member of the policy-making council of the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank. Mr. Welteke told the VWD news service that a higher dollar would help Germany's competitiveness. A more expensive dollar benefits German exporters by making goods denominated in marks more affordable.
The dollar also drew strength from weakness in the British pound, which sold off in Europe after the British Government released minutes of the June monetary meeting between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George. It showed Mr. George had opposed the move to cut interest rates by a quarter-point, to 5.75 percent.
Peter Wadkins, a vice president at the New York branch of Britain's Standard Chartered bank, said traders sold the pound on the news because "it gives them the feeling that the central bank and Government can't coordinate policy."
The dollar weakened against the yen after a Japanese business executive, discussing his meeting with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, hinted that higher interest rates loomed in Japan. Jiro Ushio, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, said Japan might raise rates before the Federal Reserve's Aug. 20 meeting. Higher rates would make yen-denominated investments worth more.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Another Government bailout, a mere $18 billion at risk.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
READY to ante up for another financial fiasco generated by regulatory myopia? Just when you thought the cost of the savings and loan debacle was pretty much past, the next Government bailout is about to hit, revolving around federally insured mortgages on subsidized housing for the poor.
This time, the cost will be much smaller: A mere $18 billion is at risk compared with more than $130 billion that taxpayers shelled out to pay off depositors at failed savings institutions. But the real question, argues Robert Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, is whether Washington will end up paying a little now or a lot more later to clean up the mess. 
 While 1.4 million poor families live in Government-owned housing, 700,000 more rent private apartments that would not have been built -- and could not be maintained -- without Federal subsidies. Owners of this Section 8 housing, named for a part of the law administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, negotiated "fair market rents" with the Government when the units were built in the 1970's and early 80's. Tenants pay 30 percent of their incomes to the landlords, with the difference paid by Washington.
Economists do not like this "Soviet style" system, as Mr. Litan, who was a top budget official in the Clinton Administration for a while, terms it, because the negotiated rents are no more determined by competitive market forces than the price the Pentagon pays for B-1 bombers. Mr. Litan and James Barth of Auburn University, estimate that two-thirds of the apartments rent for premiums over the local competition.
Tenants are not wild about the system, either. Since their subsidies are tied to the building, they are effectively prisoners of their landlords.
The real estate industry loved the system, but politicians are finally tiring of playing Uncle Sucker. "In an era of budget scarcity how can you defend a system in which the Government pays more than everybody else?" asks Nicolas P. Retsinas, Assistant Secretary of H.U.D.
But, in this highly partisan era where the Republicans rule in Congress and President Clinton runs the White House, reaching a consensus is never easy. And this problem is tough, because the renegotiation of overpriced subsidy contracts and the conversion of building-specific subsidies to housing vouchers useful anywhere won't get the Government off the financial hook. Mortgages on the subsidized buildings are all federally insured. And while no one knows the exact numbers, it is widely agreed that landlords would default on the great majority if H.U.D. allowed their rental income to fall to competitive levels. Hence from Washington's perspective, Mr. Litan notes, "it's pay now or pay later."
Make that "pay more later," much more. Unless Congress extends building-specific subsidies indefinitely -- an implausible outcome in light of the Federal budget crunch -- the Government will have to foreclose on hundreds of thousands of occupied units. H.U.D. estimates the foreclosure route would add $5 billion to the cleanup cost.
A tidier, cheaper fix, proposed by the Clinton Administration in 1995, would eliminate building-linked subsidies as the current contracts expire. The Government would voluntarily take a one-time hit by relieving building owners of a portion of their mortgage liability. Meanwhile, tenants in previously subsidized units would get housing vouchers that would give them the option of staying put or shopping for something better.
The Republican Congress took a rain check on serious consideration of the proposal. Instead, it extended expiring subsidy contracts for one year -- no big deal since fewer than 1 percent expired in 1996. And it gave H.U.D. authority to restructure the mortgages on a token 15,000 units. But subsidy contracts for 236,000 units expire next year.
Now the Clinton Administration is back with a revised proposal. The plan would pay third parties -- including state and local housing agencies -- to take over the Federal mortgage liabilities and make the best deals they could with landlords losing their above-market subsidized rents. Uncle Sam would share in any profits associated with hard bargaining. To win over the real estate lobby, the Administration has also signaled that it would not oppose tax breaks for landlords who would otherwise be forced to pay capital gains levies on any savings on their mortgage.
A bipartisan settlement of so complex and potentially embarrassing a problem along these lines may seem out of reach in a Presidential campaign. But Mr. Retsinas is cautiously optimistic. There is quiet agreement in Congress that future subsidies for affordable housing must be untangled from past errors in housing finance -- and at minimal taxpayer cost. "This," Mr. Retsinas says hopefully, "is no longer about ideology."

Treasury Prices Show Little Change

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were nearly unchanged yesterday, while in the corporate bond market, Lucent Technologies Inc. sold $1.5 billion of notes in its first public debt offering.
Trading in the Treasury market was subdued as investors awaited today's appearance before Congress by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. 
 "People are certainly nervous about what Greenspan will say and what the Fed's going to do," said William Schultz, who manages $1.4 billion of bonds at W. R. Lazard & Company in New York.
Earlier in the week, bonds had been roiled by sharp swings in the stock market and by concerns over rising interest rates. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 1/32, to 87 10/32, leaving the yield on the bond unchanged at 7.02 percent.
The calm in the bond market enabled Lucent, a former unit of the AT&T Corporation, to go ahead with its offering. Lucent sold $750 million each of five- and 10-year notes yesterday in the third-largest sale of new corporate debt this year. It will use the proceeds to help repay short-term AT&T debt it inherited.
"It's one of those hallmark deals that comes along once in a while, like Disney or Lockheed," said Robert Cessine, who manages $4 billion of corporate bonds at Kemper Funds in Chicago. The five-year notes were priced to yield 6.948 percent, or 35 basis points more than the five-year Treasury note, while the 10-year notes were priced to yield 7.28 percent, or 45 basis points more than the 10-year Treasury note, within the expected range.
Demand for the bonds may have been buttressed by recent declines in the stock market, investors said.
"The stock market is telling you the economy is slowing," said Geoffrey Kurinsky, who helps manage $18 billion of bonds at MFS Asset Management in Boston. "If you believe that, this isn't one of those companies that's going to be affected as much as a cyclical company like a steel or paper firm."
The sale followed a surge of almost 1.5 percentage points in 10-year Treasury yields this year, a rise that made some corporate treasurers reluctant borrowers.
With its sale, Lucent joins the Lockheed Martin Corporation and the Walt Disney Company, which raised some $8.1 billion in jumbo bond sales earlier in the year.
Investment grade bond issues -- those carrying a Baa3 or higher rating by Moody's Investors Service and BBB- or higher rating by the Standard & Poor's Corporation -- accounted for 60 percent of the total of the $52.8 billion corporate bond sales in the United States in the second quarter, down from nearly 75 percent of the $57.6 billion in the first quarter, according to Standard & Poor's.

HEADLINE: Bully-Boy Foreign Policy

BYLINE: By Gideon Rose; Gideon Rose is a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:
Recently, I asked an editor of a foreign policy journal why he wasn't publishing any criticism of legislation like the Helms-Burton Act, which penalizes foreign companies dealing with Cuban properties formerly owned by American businesses. Everyone knows that such extraterritorial sanctions don't work, he replied, so what would be the point?
There is indeed much agreement that these kinds of sanctions are misguided attempts to coerce allies into following Washington's lead on regional issues. Nevertheless, they are now official policy. Congress approved the Cuba legislation, named for its Republican co-sponsors, Senator Jesse Helms and Representative Dan Burton, by an overwhelming margin. President Clinton signed it in March. 
 Last week, the Administration invoked the law in moving to deny entry visas to executives of a Canadian mining company doing business with Cuba. This week, the Administration chose not to waive -- as it could have -- a provision of the act allowing American lawsuits against many foreign companies doing business in Cuba, although under pressure from allies it blocked such suits for six months. The trend does not stop with Cuba: Legislation now in Congress would penalize foreign businesses involved in big oil deals with Iran and Libya; the President has said he will sign that, too.
Basically, these punitive actions are fits of pique; the aim is to try to bully allies who cannot be persuaded into supporting American policy. But they are counterproductive. In the pursuit of minor foreign policy objectives, such penalties can lead to major disputes between the United States and its allies.
In the early 1980's, for example, the Reagan Administration worried that a pipeline carrying natural gas from the Soviet Union to Western Europe would help the Soviet economy and make Europe dependent. So it prohibited foreign subsidiaries of American businesses from participating. When the ban threatened relations with allies, the Reagan Administration was forced to back down.
Heavy-handed attempts to dictate the foreign policy of Washington's allies are not worth it even in the case of Iran, whose quest for nuclear weapons and support of terrorist groups are worrisome. Playing such games over the backwater that is Cuba today is risible, especially when it outrages American allies: Canada, the European Union and Latin American countries have threatened retaliation.
The current vogue for these kinds of sanctions has everything to do with domestic politics, of course. Republicans raised the Cuba issue to court Cuban-Americans and paint the Democrats as soft on tyrants. The Clinton team is trying to beat the Republicans by joining them.
This would merely be politics as usual if it did not symbolize a dangerous impulse in both parties to treat foreign affairs as a second-class arena. Damage relations with our chief allies over Cuba? Who cares? Some votes in Florida and New Jersey may depend on the issue. Expand NATO? That could undermine Washington's Russia policy, but it sounds tough and might please Americans of Eastern European descent.
These days, one of the few ways the United States could undermine its status as the world's dominant power would be to act so erratically that other nations question whether it is wise to continue their deference. This is why Helms-Burton and measures like it are more consequential than they might appear. They may erode the trust that others place in America -- a trust that makes for a safer world.

HEADLINE: The Better Welfare Bill

 BODY:
The House plans to vote today on two welfare bills. The Republican version could push a million children into poverty, victimize legal immigrants and leave no ironclad Federal safety net underneath families that search for but cannot find work. The bipartisan alternative, sponsored by Mike Castle, Republican of Delaware, and John Tanner, a Tennessee Democrat, is also needlessly punitive but at least removes the cruelest fangs of the G.O.P. measure.
The Republican bill would end the entitlement of states to increasing Federal help when their welfare rolls swell during recessions. The bill calls for penalizing recipients who fail to find work within two years, but provides too little money to prepare them to find jobs. It would cut off benefits entirely after five years even for families that looked earnestly, but unsuccessfully, for work. 
 The Republicans are threatening to allow states to knock some children covered by Medicaid off the program and prohibit legal immigrants -- who pay taxes like everyone else -- from collecting food stamps and disability payments. Besides cutting food stamps by tens of billions of dollars -- over $600 a year for the poorest families -- the measure would also allow states to cut their own welfare spending by 20 percent, hitting the poor with a double blow.
The preferable Castle-Tanner bill eliminates many of these excesses. It would provide uncapped Federal help to states during steep recessions. It would require states to provide Medicaid to children it currently covers. Children of some of the parents thrown off welfare would temporarily receive vouchers for vital services. Castle-Tanner preserves a federally guaranteed food stamp program and preserves health coverage for poor immigrant children and pregnant women. It permits states to cut back welfare spending by only 15 percent and spends $3 billion more than the G.O.P. plan on welfare-to-work programs.
President Clinton tried this week to take some steam out of Congress's rush to slash welfare by pledging new rules to require welfare recipients to sign plans to work within two years, and to sanction those who refuse available work. But that does not do much more than exhort states to enforce current law.
Even the Castle-Tanner bill, despite its compassionate virtues, cuts welfare programs too far. It would make huge reductions in food stamp spending. It would eliminate federally guaranteed cash assistance for those who cannot find work. It would rob legal immigrants of the existing safety net. But it is the best option the Republicans will allow on the House floor anytime soon.

Bulls, Bears and the White House

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

 BODY:
For sheer drama, the stock market has certainly surpassed the sluggish race between Bob Dole and President Clinton this summer. More striking, however, is what the two phenomena have in common. Both politics and the markets can be moved by mysterious, irrational forces. While Mr. Dole is trying to figure out why he cannot do better against a President with low poll ratings on character and integrity, Mr. Clinton may be wondering why the strong economy has not led to more stable markets.
Economists and political experts are also confused. When the markets started dropping, most analysts said it was because the economy was overheating, and that the resulting inflation would lead to higher interest rates. Higher bond rates, in turn, draw investors away from equities. Now economists say the troubles occurred because the economy is cooling off, particularly in the technology sector. 
 The complaint about good news being bad news on Wall Street is hardly new, but the latest version is truly disheartening. Everyone agrees that one of the major unsolved problems facing the United States is wage stagnation, particularly among low earners. Recently there have been signs that wages are picking up. Then, wham! Wall Street gets spooked about "wage inflation," and stock prices tumble. Did you think the conflict between labor and capital died with the cold war?
The overriding political fact of life is that Mr. Clinton's standing in the polls is due more to economics than anything else. Americans who denied the Democrats credit for the improving economy in 1994 now seem to be giving them credit, whether or not that is fair or logical. Even Mr. Dole says the President deserves some credit. History shows that Presidents with a good record on job growth, low unemployment and low inflation get re-elected.
Still, if anything could shake up the Presidential race, it would be a stock market collapse. Until recently the market has been a gravity-defying plus for the President, soaring more than 60 percent since he took office and creating trillions of dollars in new wealth. Small wonder some Democrats fear that a decline could presage economic contraction.
The Administration argues that both the stock market and the economy generally have been helped by cuts in the deficit. (This week the White House announced that the current year's deficit will be $117 billion, 60 percent lower than it was when Mr. Clinton took office.) While some economists argue that reduced Federal spending slows economic growth, Clinton aides and many on Wall Street say deficit reduction helped persuade the markets and the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low, encouraging investment and growth.
In any case, the Republican counter-argument has not been to dispute the value of reduced deficits. Mr. Dole argues instead that the deficit was reduced in part by "the largest tax increase in history." (It was the biggest in history, but only in the sense that "Independence Day" is the biggest-grossing movie in history. Adjusted for inflation, the 1993 tax increase was comparable to other tax increases that Mr. Dole himself voted for in the past.) The Clinton tax increase has accounted for about half the deficit reduction that has occurred on his watch. In political terms, raising taxes was a "riverboat gamble" as much as President Reagan's 1981 tax cuts were. But it has certainly not killed job growth and widened the deficit, as Republicans predicted.
If most economists agree that, Wall Street notwithstanding, deficit reduction has been a plus for the economy, it sharpens the dilemma faced by Mr. Dole. He has been under fire for years from conservatives for supporting tax hikes. The political world is waiting for his economic program, to be unveiled soon. It would be a supreme irony if the strong economy under Mr. Clinton reinforced Mr. Dole's instincts, making him oppose the tax cuts conservatives are pushing to energize his campaign. Mr. Dole's performance may be more intriguing than the stock market's. STEVEN R. WEISMAN

HEADLINE: Convention Underscores Hispanic Consumer Market, and Complaints of Bias

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: DENVER, July 17

 BODY:
At the National Council of La Raza convention here, a recruiter from Wal-Mart was busy today handing out glossy brochures that boasted of the career opportunities that the discount retailer could offer Hispanic employees.
No more than 20 feet from the Wal-Mart booth in the exhibitors' hall, on tables occupied by local affiliates of the National Council, were stacks of flyers accusing Wal-Mart of barring 11 Hispanic men from shopping in its store in Amory, Miss., two years ago. In a sworn statement attached to the flyers, the men's employer recounted his protest to the store manager: 
 "And I said, 'Son, you can't do that. That's against the law. You know, you're discriminating against these men.' He was very apologetic. He said, 'I'm sorry. I'm just doing what I was told to do.' "
Betsy Reithemeyer, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said in a telephone interview from company headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., that "if there was any discrimination, it definitely was a violation of our policy."
The juxtaposition of the Wal-Mart booth and the flyers condemning the chain captured in microcosm the twin themes at this annual gathering of the National Council of La Raza, the country's largest Hispanic service organization.
On one hand, the 3,500 conference participants are being courted Fortune 500 companies that are seeking to tap into the burgeoning economic power of the country's Hispanic population of more than 22 million.
Over 70 of the country's largest corporations paid as much as $50,000 each to sponsor a luncheon or dinner and maintain a booth during the organization's four-day conference, which ended today.
Latinas lined up at the Nordstrom booth to win a basket of cosmetics. Representatives of Rockwell International handed out rubber erasers in the shape of the space shuttle. Anheuser-Busch gave away 6-ounce cups of Budweiser, Allstate handed out material soliciting insurance business.
Edwina Anderson, representing Reebok, explained her company's presence this way: "Of course the ultimate goal is to sell products. But also by supporting groups like La Raza, we send a message that we believe in corporate responsibility."
But even as they were being pursued by corporate America, conference participants and their leaders expressed anger and impatience at what they say is an increasing anti-Hispanic tenor in the political debate.
Citing proposals in Congress to bar the children of illegal immigrants from public schools, to declare English the country's official language and to deny Federal benefits to legal immigrants who are not yet citizens, Hispanic leaders here complain that their people are being exploited by the political system.
"We feel that we are being used as scapegoats, that we're being stigmatized, that we are indeed the Willie Hortons of 1996," said Raul Yzaguirre, the president of the National Council of La Raza. "But, instead of it being one individual, it's an entire community that's being scapegoated and used as a symbol to divide the American people."
Mr. Yzaguirre noted in a keynote speech on Monday that none of the major Presidential contenders chose to attend the La Raza convention or any other meeting of a national Hispanic organization.
"Intended or not, the Presidential candidates are sending us a message about the status of the Hispanic community," he said. "They're telling us that we don't count, that our support is not worth soliciting and that we can be taken for granted."
The group is officially non-partisan and its leaders criticized the major parties in equal measure. But Republicans came in for particularly harsh judgments. At a debate between representatives of the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee, questioners peppered the Republican official with hostile questions, ignoring his please to focus on questions of President Clinton's character.
"I really don't care about Whitewater, or the F.B.I. files," J. Homar Perez, a delegate from Washington, shouted at the Republican official, Antonio Monroig. "I care about what affects my life."
Officials of the organization say that since the passage of in 1994 of Proposition 187, a California ballot initiative that cuts state benefits, including education, to the children of illegal immigrants, the La Raza conventions have become much more infused with political activism.
This year, for the second year in a row, officials provided an update to participants on the status of pending legislation in Washington. The workshop drew an overflow crowd, with people who could not squeeze into the room standing in the hall outside, straining to hear.
Amid the corporate booths in the exhibition hall, the organization maintained a table where participants could sign and send as many as four form letters to their Congressional representatives. The letters protested pending legislation on budget cuts, affirmative action, immigration and English as the official language. By the end of the conference today, nearly 5,000 letters had been sent.
"Ever since they passed the 187 bill, the one in California, I think there has been more discrimination," Mary Lou Olivas, a delegate from Twin Falls, Idaho, said as she signed all four of the letters.

HEADLINE: 500,000 Strike in Israel to Protest Netanyahu's Economic Plans

BYLINE: By JOEL GREENBERG 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 17

 BODY:
Opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plans for Israel's economy today closed factories, banks and Government offices across the country with a general strike, which also crippled hospitals, public utilities and the national airport.
The strike was called by the umbrella labor federation, the Histadrut, which accuses the Government of approving budget cuts that will hurt middle-class wage-earners and the poor. About half a million workers took part. 
 The 10-hour shutdown and a plunge in Israeli stock prices in the last two weeks were two major indicators of public unease over the new economic measures Mr. Netanyahu pushed through this month.
But even as he was buffeted by economic troubles at home, Mr. Netanyahu prepared to travel to Cairo on Thursday to meet the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak. Striking a tone of urgency, Palestinian officials and Egypt's Ambassador to Israel pressed Mr. Netanyahu to move swiftly to restart Arab-Israeli peace talks and to carry out agreements with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Mr. Netanyhau has taken a cautious line on negotiations with the Arabs, but he has acted quickly on the economic front, provoking resistance.
The Government approved a $1.6 billion budget cut last week before Mr. Netanyahu left for the United States, where, in addition to conferring with President Clinton and other Government leaders, he met business leaders in an effort to drum up investment. Mr. Netanyahu vowed to free the Israeli economy of Government controls and promised "sweeping liberalization" of the economy, including the breakup of monopolies and the sale of Government-owned enterprises.
But the budget cuts have drawn criticism from many Israelis who feel unfairly burdened by reductions in state support. These include cuts in childbirth allowances and benefits for the elderly, as well as increases in bus fares and medical fees.
The Histadrut, which is dominated by the opposition Labor Party, complains that workers are feeling the effects of the Government's belt-tightening, and the labor organization is demanding a role in setting economic policy. It said that today's strike was a first warning.
"We are striking to tell the Government that this nation is united, that its rumblings are real," said Amir Peretz, the head of the Histadrut, at a rally of thousands of protesters outside Parliament. "If they do not come and talk to us, we will not be able to stop the rumblings."
"We want to tell the Government that its 100 days of grace do not mean 100 days of quiet," Mr. Peretz said. "These are 100 days in which we expect you to speak with us."
Mr. Netanyahu was also prodded today to restart talks with the Palestinians and to carry out Israel's agreements with the P.L.O.
"We don't want to put Mr. Netanyahu in a corner, but we would like to encourage him to move quickly because the time factor is crucial," the Egyptian Ambassador, Mohammed Bassiouny, said at a symposium at Tel Aviv University. "You can perhaps convince the leaders to wait, but you can't convince the people."
Mr. Bassiouny said that Mr. Mubarak would urge Mr. Netanyahu to carry out clauses of the Israeli-Palestinian accords, including those that call for withdrawing Israeli troops from Hebron and other areas of the West Bank, and to ease a border closing of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He also said it was time for Israel to carry out its commitment to start negotiating a final peace settlement with the Palestinians.

HEADLINE: Europe Gives Cold Shoulder To Clinton On Cuba Law

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 17

 BODY:
President Clinton's decision to suspend for six months that part of a law allowing lawsuits against foreign companies that use confiscated United States property in Cuba got only a lukewarm welcome today from the 15-nation European Union.
European officials warned of a new dispute with the United States over similar proposed legislation that would affect European investments in Libya and Iran. 
 European Union countries would vigorously oppose attempts to impose American law on foreign companies' operations overseas, officials said, and would go on doing business in Cuba whether the United States liked it or not.
Peter Guilford, a spokesman for the European Union's Executive Commission in Brussels, said that despite Mr. Clinton's attempt to be conciliatory, officials there were still working on plans for member countries to retaliate by denying visas to officers of selected American corporations, and on other measures.
The American law also denies entry into the United States to executives of foreign companies that "traffic" in Cuban concerns that use American property seized by the Communist Government in Havana over the past 37 years.
Though the Europeans are unlikely to proceed with retaliatory steps for days or even weeks, Mr. Guilford said, "we are preparing the legal work to go ahead with the countermeasures decided by European Union foreign ministers on Monday."
The foreign ministers gave the green light for retaliatory actions that would include taking the dispute to the World Trade Organization, establishing a list of American companies that file suit against European companies under the new law, and requiring visas for some American business travelers.
President Clinton suspended the part of the law, the Helms-Burton Act, that would allow Americans to sue foreign companies that use American property seized by the Cuban Government of Fidel Castro, which means no lawsuits can be filed for the next six months.
The German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, welcomed Mr. Clinton's decision to delay the lawsuits as "a step in the right direction," according to the Foreign Ministry in Bonn, and there were similar statements by his colleagues in Ireland, France and Spain, a strong opponent of the new law.
Mr. Clinton does not have the statutory authority to suspend the part of the law that its opponents abroad hate most, allowing the United States to bar entry to executives of certain companies.
Under Title IV of the new law, American officials announced this month that nine executives and directors of Sherritt International, a Canadian mining group, and members of their families would be barred from entering the United States starting in late August.
"We are still bothered by the extraterritorial aspects of the law," another European Union official said. Representatives of the 15 member countries are to meet in Brussels on Thursday to discuss Mr. Clinton's actions, but Mr. Guilford said further steps would depend on how upset member governments were.
After the United States Senate voted on Tuesday night to punish non-United States companies that invest in the oil and gas industries of Libya and Iran, France said it was opposed to extraterritorial legislation in principle, and said it violated World Trade Organization rules.
Britain's Trade Secretary, Ian Lang, told BBC Radio this morning, "We must bring home to the Americans the unacceptable nature of what they are doing." He said there was little likelihood that European countries would join the United States in trying to isolate Cuba economically and diplomatically.
"We believe democracy should be encouraged in Cuba," he said. "We share the Americans' objective there. But we don't see the way of doing that as being to attack trading partners in other parts of the world who are carrying on legitimate business with Cuba."
A Spanish hotel management company, Sol Melia S.A., which owns six hotels in Cuba, said on Tuesday that it had not received notification that its executives would be barred from the United States, but shares in its stock fell by more than 1.8 percent anyway.
Canada and Mexico also oppose the Helms-Burton law, and Lloyd Axworthy, the Canadian Foreign Minister, said of the President's suspension of part of it that "under the circumstances, with the pressure domestically, it was about as good as we could get."
"It's an election year," a French official said.
Mr. Clinton opposed the legislation until February, and then approved it after Cuban fighter planes shot down two small planes flown by anti-Castro Cuban exiles with the proviso that he had until July 16 to waive part of the bill.

While Albany Fiddled, Many Got Burned

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THE Legislature and Governor relaxed last week after finally reaching agreement on the latest state budget ever. Lawmakers got their pork -- money for pet projects back home. And Gov. George E. Pataki, though an abject failure in meeting his goal of bringing in a conservative budget on time, nonetheless pronounced himself deeply satisfied because, he said, he and his administration "stuck to our principles."
Stuart Weinberg is not satisfied. He is a college administrator who was laid off because his college did not know whether the state would again finance his program. 
 Jane Velez is not satisfied, either. She runs a human services agency that had to "downsize" in anticipation of a state budget cut.
Monifa Famad is unhappy, too. She was looking forward to a summer studies program at Barnard College, but Barnard had to cancel it because of the budgetary uncertainties.
Mr. Weinberg, Ms. Velez and Ms. Famad are far from alone. The public tends to think of the delayed budget approval -- on July 13 instead of April 1 -- as an abstraction, an accounting matter. In fact, the shenanigans in Albany have had flesh-and-blood consequences. They are hurting ordinary New Yorkers -- hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people who depend on the state's largess.
There's got to be a better way to do this," said Ms. Velez, president of the Project Return Foundation, which serves the homeless, AIDS patients, battered women and drug abusers. "Nobody expects the budget to come in on time anymore. Nobody even gets mad. The only people who get upset are people like me, who have to make a payroll."
Project Return gave notice to some drug counselors in March, and cut back medical hours because of deep cuts in the Governor's original budget proposal. Some of the cuts have been restored, but Ms. Velez wanted to avoid an even more damaging scramble when the budget finally passed.
Project Return still does not know its state allocation.
Neither does Luis Garden-Acosta, president of El Puente, a community organization in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. It deliberately went into debt to keep its staff members employed.
"We have not paid rent," said Mr. Garden-Acosta, who has been plowing his salary into the agency and living on savings since April 1. "We have not dealt with most of our vendors, which puts us in a real difficult situation. I don't think the public realizes that so many people in the state are going without meeting basic needs, going on I.O.U.'s to be able to survive."
MR. WEINBERG, director of the Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program at Onondaga Community College in Syracuse, has been unemployed since July 1 because his school could not get a guarantee of new state financing. The Legislature has decided to continue the program, widely known as C-STEP, which provides courses for minority and economically disadvantaged students. But the participating colleges do not yet know their budgets. So Mr. Weinberg, father of two, expects he will be off the payroll most of the summer. "I can collect some unemployment," he said. "I can teach. We'll get by."
Barbara Deming, a secretary for the program at the State University at Brockport, is out of a job, which pays a modest $21,200 a year, for a while, too. The program director reluctantly had to take her off the payroll July 1, and she does not know when she will go back to work. "So you're doing an interview on how it feels to be a yo-yo?" she asked the other day. "Not good. It's extremely difficult to plan."
The state upset Monifa Famad's plans, too. The 17-year-old student was headed for a summer of study at Barnard College in the STEP program, which is for high school students. But because some Federal money was no longer available, and the state could not commit itself to making up the difference, Barnard had to cancel. The last week in June, the program's director, Saul Davis, notified 40 students that the program was off. They had expected to take courses in math, science, writing and public speaking. Instead, some will piggyback on another program and enroll in only one physics course.
Michael A. Molina, director of the STEP and C-STEP programs at Fordham, said he had to cancel a similar summer session for about 20 incoming freshmen.
The students will find something else to do. It is not life and death, any of this. It is simply an injustice, brought to you by the Governor and Legislature of New York.

HEADLINE: Serb Stands Firm in Face of U.S. Effort to Oust Karadzic

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, July 17

 BODY:
A round of high-profile American talks to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia to remove the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, from power in Bosnia ended without progress today, the special United States envoy to the Balkans, Richard C. Holbrooke, said.
After four hours of talks with Mr. Milosevic, the man whom Mr. Holbrooke persuaded to sign the Dayton peace accords last fall, the envoy left for Zagreb to meet with the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, and said he would return here on Thursday. 
 Diplomats said Mr. Holbrooke had threatened to reimpose sanctions on the battered Serbian economy if Mr. Milosevic did not bring about the removal of Dr. Karadzic as head of the biggest political party in the Serbian portion of Bosnia, and his immediate departure from Bosnia.
Under the Dayton accord, Dr. Karadzic, who is under international indictment for war crimes, is supposed to be arrested and handed to the tribunal in the Hague. But American officials are now eager, at a minimum, to remove Dr. Karadzic from power in Bosnia well before the national elections are held there on Sept. 14.
Mr. Holbrooke appears to be facing an informal Friday deadline for Dr. Karadzic's resignation from his post as party chief, at least. On Monday, Western officials delayed the official start of campaigning for the Bosnian elections until Friday to allow time for his removal, and said they would not allow Dr. Karadzic's powerful party to take part if he remains in office.
Unwilling to risk provoking retaliation by using NATO troops to arrest Dr. Karadzic, Western countries have threatened renewed economic sanctions against Belgrade, which is believed to have the ability to force Dr. Karadzic out. This threat may be Mr. Holbrooke's strongest lever as he negotiates with Mr. Milosevic here.
But diplomats and economic analysts wondered how seriously Mr. Milosevic would take the threat.
A Western diplomat here said Mr. Milosevic held a "healthy skepticism" about whether the major powers, who are divided over the question, would quickly organize effective sanctions like a ban on trade.
Economists also questioned whether Mr. Milosevic, a skilled political poker player, would be influenced by the economic threats or rewards Mr. Holbrooke can offer.
United Nations sanctions against Serbia were suspended after the Dayton accord but can be reimposed for noncompliance with the treaty. On the positive side, Mr. Holbrooke can offer to formally end the sanctions, lifting the cloud of uncertainty that might deter international investors.
Since the suspension of sanctions last December, there has been little improvement in the Serbian economy, largely because of the determination of Mr. Milosevic, a former Communist, to keep state controls and his refusal to allow privatization.
But daily life has regained a modicum of normality. Families no longer hoard oil, sugar and other foodstuffs and gasoline, previously sold on the roadside by black marketeers, is more easily available.
Thus, initially, the reimposition of sanctions would mainly have a negative psychological impact on the country, economists said.
"If we have sanctions again, we will have a really bad situation," said Tomislav Popovic, director of the Institute of Economic Sciences in Belgrade, and a critic of the government's policies. "But we have developed survival mechanisms and the possibility to live under many limitations."
In the longer term, however, new sanctions would be "catastrophic," Mr. Popovic said. The once healthy but now decrepit industrial base -- 70 percent of factory machinery is useless because of the effect of three years of sanctions -- would decay further, he said.
Western diplomats said that one of Mr. Holbrooke's strongest positive incentives would be allowing Serbia to re-enter international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund, the World Trade Organization and the United Nations. But a Serbian economist at the Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies, Vladimir Gligorov, said that because state monopolies were enriching Mr. Milosevic's political cronies, membership in the I.M.F. and the World Bank would not be that attractive at the moment.
"They are not in a great hurry about that because they are not ready to accept the conditions the I.M.F. would put on Serbia," Mr. Gligorov said.
To gain I.M.F. support Mr. Milosevic would have to agree to politically unpalatable policies, like reducing the deficit, now estimated at between 10 and 20 percent of gross domestic product, and slashing subsidies to industry.
Politically, Mr. Milosevic seems to have little to lose by ousting Dr. Karadzic and may even gain. With Dr. Karadzic out of the way, for example, Mr. Milosevic's Socialist Party would have a better chance of winning seats in the Bosnian elections.
"We are actually asking Milosevic to do something that will help him in the election but Milosevic has set it up so cleverly we have to grease his palm to get him to do it," one diplomat said.
Should he choose to act, Mr. Milosevic has plenty of economic and political leverage over Dr. Karadzic, said Serbian economists who described the Serbian-held region of Bosnia as a virtual colony of Belgrade.
The Bosnian Serb police are heavily infiltrated by people loyal to the Serbian leader, they said. Almost all of Serbian-held Bosnia's food and industrial products come from Serbia and the Bosnian Serb military is completely dependant on the Yugoslav national army, run by Mr. Milosevic.
Further, Mr. Milosevic could, if he wanted to, choke off the profitable smuggling businesses that many Bosnian Serb leaders run through Serbia.
White House officials in Washington, mindful that President Clinton faces election in November, sent Mr. Holbrooke on his mission in the hope that the Bosnian elections can proceed smoothly, avoiding a collapse of the Dayton peace effort. However, they say they feel little domestic political pressure to take military risks to arrest Dr. Karadzic.
The expected Republican nominee, Bob Dole, attacked the President's approach this week in response to questions.
Referring to the continued power of Dr. Karadzic and the Bosnian Serb military leader General Ratko Mladic, who is also under indictment for war crimes, Mr. Dole said:
"All we've heard from the Administration are empty threats, not even the minimal action of reimposing sanctions."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Olympics Are a Mixed Blessing for Atlantans

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 17

 BODY:
They are stocking up on medicine, canceling trips to the mall and digging in for the long haul at Judith Barash's senior citizens high rise.
"I see people carrying in all this bottled water, and I tell them, 'What? You're running in the Olympics? What do you need all that water for?' " said Mrs. Barash, a 75-year-old retiree and one of 240 elderly residents of her building. "But people don't know what to expect. They hear things on television about running out of water, and they don't want to take any chances." 
 Indeed, two days before the official opening of the Olympics on Friday, Atlanta remains a place where no one is quite certain what to expect in terms of commuting, commerce, crowds and chaos. What is clear is that after six years of almost hysterical buildup, the Olympics are having myriad effects on virtually everyone living here, but many of those effects bear little relation to the grandiose expectations engendered when Atlanta was awarded the Games.
Despite predictions that visitors would have to go almost to Chattanooga to get a hotel room, rooms are still available in Atlanta. Despite expectations that the Olympics would be a windfall for tens of thousands of homeowners, Olympic housing rentals have turned into a buyer's market, leaving most owners disappointed. The overall Olympic economic impact seems certain to be smaller than originally expected.
Still, after six years of doubts about its ability to be host of the Games, Atlanta has apparently made it to the starting line with its stadiums built, its malls full of Russian power lifters and Dutch archers, its transportation plans in place, more or less prepared to be host to the 100th Anniversary Olympic Games.
"We'll be ready, but we won't be finished," said former Mayor Andrew Young, co-chairman of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, the host of the Games. "Every night during the Games, we'll probably have crews on the streets doing things. But the spirit of the people will more than make up for the physical things that were not completed."
Visitors will find an odd mix of corporate extravaganza and tent city. Atlanta's downtown is at once gussied up with new streets, sidewalks, signs and art and at the same time has turned into a temporary tent city looking like an insanely overblown county fair.
Locals are finding a place transformed, in small ways like the international flags sprouting incongruously in local supermarkets or outside laundromats; in odd ways like the army of people with arms like tree trunks barking into cellular phones in French or German, and in ways whose long-term impact remain uncertain.
Some Atlantans are getting the economic bonanza they expected.
Rick Patton's hotel development company has had two projects, one downtown in what had been an old bus station, the other just outside Atlanta in suburban Vinings. The new hotel in Vinings was immediately filled with the delegation from the Russian Olympic Committee and the downtown building has been turned into the Centennial Gateway Pavilion, a marketplace and eatery with a staff of about 220 people at a prime location just down the street from Centennial Olympic Park.
"We did our projections without planning on the Olympics, so these are windfalls, but they're nice windfalls to have," Mr. Patton said.
Others are benefiting in smaller ways.
John Bradford got out of the Army on June 30 and is now general manager of the Tower, a 12-story, 123-foot-high tower shaped like the Olympic torch with a 16-foot Olympic flame, which has infuriated Olympic officials by opening across the highway from the Olympic Village. In addition to his other duties with the company that built the Tower, he heads a crew of six that sells souvenirs and leads visitors up the 156 steps to the top for $3.
Workers are so hard to come by that virtually every grocery store or fast-food outlet near Atlanta has a help-wanted sign up and some local Waffle Houses are trying to lure customers into becoming employees during the Games. Those who do get green T-shirts reading, "Waffle House: Eaten There, Worked There, Got the T-Shirt!"
But there are plenty of disappointed people as well.
Donald Ratajczak, an economist at Georgia State University, said that instead of the $5.1 billion economic impact projected for the Games, the impact would be closer to $4 billion, largely because about twice as many tickets went to locals as organizers had projected and because visitors turned out to be more likely to stay with friends than in hotels. Olympic officials are quick to say that whether $5.1 billion or $4 billion, that is still an enormous economic boost.
Still, an anticipated bonanza in home rentals never materialized. Private Housing 1996, the organization set up by the Olympics to help visitors rent homes, has about 30,000 homeowners in its database. The organization expects now to rent about 1,000 private homes and about 1,500 apartments. Private rental firms and homeowners trying to rent on their own have also had much less success than anticipated.
And the Games are having a negative impact on other business. Amusement parks, museums and zoos are all struggling, partly because people are so terrified of Olympic traffic, they will not venture out. Bookings are terrible throughout the North Georgia mountains. Wedding planners and tuxedo dealers had their worst June and July ever because no one is getting married.
What's good for some people is bad for others. Carpenters, construction crews and remodeling firms have been in such demand that homeowners with modest jobs have found it almost impossible even to get calls returned. Randy Terrell tried for months to get workers for a modest 15-by-12-foot wading pool for toddlers at his community swimming club, but bids were so high and workers so hard to find he had to do most of the work himself and still does not have it done.
Dan Neilson, who delivers pizzas for Papa John's Pizza at what should be a prime location across from the Olympic Village, is distraught because the roads will be closed or gridlocked, preventing deliveries.
Sandy Walters, who cuts hair a few blocks away, is closing down because the Olympic athletes have supplanted her customers from Georgia Tech.
"They get their hair cut free," she said. "I can't compete with free."
Almost everyone is adjusting plans for the next few weeks, with many employees working from home or working odd hours, restaurants and contractors making deliveries between midnight and 6 A.M. and many businesses closing down. Some government bodies, like courts, will be closed, and Piedmont Hospital has rented a helicopter to airlift doctors in case of emergencies.
Despite widespread expectations of gridlock near downtown, no one knows for sure what will happen with traffic. Despite fears of water shortages, officials say the city is prepared for the two million to three million visitors.
While the uncertainty is nerveracking for many, particularly the elderly or those needing to get to hospitals or doctors, others are trying to make the best of it.
A. J. Robinson, head of Portman International, an Atlanta development firm, said his wife is due to give birth July 30, right in the middle of the expected Olympic gridlock.
"I've worked it out with my wife that if she plans it right, the marathon goes around our neighborhood on Aug. 4, so people can watch the beginning of it, then come by for brunch and then run to the other side of the neighborhood for the finish."

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Ford Posts A Big Profit For Quarter

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., July 17

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company posted stronger second-quarter earnings today than analysts had expected, including solid profits from financial services and an improvement from its North American car-making operations. The results spurred a rally in auto issues and helped steady the stock market.
Ford said that earnings rose 21 percent, to $1.90 billion in the second quarter, or $1.56 a share, on sales of $37.94 billion, from $1.57 billion, or $1.30 a share, on sales of $36.39 billion in the period a year earlier. 
 This quarter's results were inflated slightly by a one-time net gain of $213 million, or 18 cents a share. But analysts said that the company's results over all showed Ford was beginning to rebound after nearly a year of heavy spending on the introduction of new models like the Taurus sedan and F-150 pickup truck.
Ford cut back on sales of heavily discounted vehicles to rental fleets in the second quarter, while gaining from strong demand for the highly profitable F-150 and Explorer sport utility vehicle. "We are at the inception of a period where we can expect to see improved results from the North American automotive operations," said Maryann N. Keller, an analyst at Furman Selz in New York.
David N. McCammon, Ford's vice president for finance, forecast that strong sales and profits would continue through the rest of the year, even if the stock market tumbles and the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates as much as half a percentage point. The 1987 market crash had little effect on car sales that year or in 1988 or 1989, he noted.
Ford's stock rose $1.75 to close at $32.25 today in fairly heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of the General Motors Corporation climbed $2, to $49. The Chrysler Corporation's shares, which split 2 for 1 after the close of trading on Monday, jumped $1.125, to $29.375.
Ford's one-time gain of $213 million was the net from two moves that had been previously announced. Ford posted a $650 million gain after taxes from the initial public offering of 19.3 percent of the common stock in the Associates First Capital Corporation, a commercial finance and leasing company.
Ford also took a $437 million charge to write down its investment in Budget Rent a Car, and now plans to take control of the rental car company, provided Federal antitrust regulators do not object because Ford also owns Hertz, the largest rental car company.
Excluding the one-time gain, Ford earned $1.38 a share, or 8 cents more than a year earlier. The consensus of analysts had been that Ford would only earn $1.21 in the second quarter, excluding one-time gains, according to a survey by the First Call Corporation.
But today's results also contained a few signs of lingering trouble. Ford spent an average of $945 in cash rebates, lease subsidies and other incentives for each vehicle sold to retail buyers in the second quarter, up from $760 a year ago; Ford has found it necessary to give a lot of money back to buyers of its Taurus sedan and Windstar mini-van.
Mr. McCammon said that Ford would offer similar retail incentives in the third quarter. But because the company is offering fewer discounts to fleet purchasers, overall marketing costs in North America fell to 8.4 percent of gross revenue, from 8.7 percent a year earlier, he said.
Net income from automotive operations in the United States was $697 million, up from $663 million the corresponding period a year ago. But the company's net income from international operations dipped to $411 million, from $427 million a year earlier, as brisk competition in Europe and Brazil eroded margins.
Excluding the one-time gain from the sale of the Associates stake, Ford earned $582 million in the second quarter from financial services, up from $472 million a year earlier.
Mr. McCammon was mildly critical of the Clinton Administration's "strong dollar" policy, echoing concerns expressed by Chrysler officials last week. The dollar's recent strength against the Japanese yen has eroded Ford's profits in Japan while making Japanese auto makers more competitive in the United States, he said.
"They're certainly making it difficult for those of us who would like to export more," Mr. McCammon said. "We have gone a little overboard" in allowing the dollar to strengthen against the yen, he contended.

This is the net effect of Ford's takeover of the management control of its Budget Rent A Car Corp. unit, which resulted in an after-tax charge of $437 million, and the posting of a one-time after-tax gain of $650 million related to the initial public offering of 19.3 percent of its Associates First Capital Corp. unit.

HEADLINE: Building Starts on Homes Took Strong Jump in June

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
Construction starts on new homes rose unexpectedly in June, the Commerce Department said today, in the latest evidence of the resiliency of the housing market.
"So far, the strong job market and strong consumer confidence have been winning the tug-of-war against higher interest rates," said Eileen Neely, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae. 
 Housing starts rose 1.3 percent, to 1.48 million units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, in June after retreating a revised 3.3 percent in May. The May rate was up from a previously reported drop of 4.7 percent. Many economists had been expecting a small decline in housing starts for June.
In addition, single-family construction -- 80 percent of total starts -- reached a two-year high.
The department also said that starts in April and May were even stronger than originally estimated. They totaled 1.51 million in April, rather than 1.50 million, and 1.46 million in May, rather than 1.43 million.
The national picture in June was mixed, however. While overall starts were up in the South and West, they slipped in the Northeast and Midwest. And the volatile multifamily sector posted a double-digit decline.
And many analysts expect housing starts to begin to slow this summer as mortgage rates continue to rise.
"It won't be a slump, but we won't have the breakneck pace we saw during the first half of the year," Ms. Neely of Fannie Mae said. "One indication of a slowdown already is showing up" in building permits, she said.
Applications for building permits, a gauge of builder confidence and future activity, slipped 2.5 percent in June to a 1.42 million rate.
It was the second consecutive decline.
A survey by the National Association of Home Builders also suggested that the market might be leveling off.
"The gradual decline occurs as pent-up demand from the unusually severe winter months runs its course and home buyers begin to slow the pace of purchases as a result of rising interest rates," the association said.
During June, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.32 percent, up from 8.09 percent in May and matching the average in April 1995.
By last week, they had risen to 8.42 percent, meaning the monthly payments on a $100,000 mortgage would be about $100 more than they would last January, when rates averaged 7.03 percent.
Still, Paul Taylor, economist with America's Community Bankers, said that even at 8 percent, mortgage rates were still "at a generational low for a lot of people."
Single-family starts shot up 7.4 percent, to a 1.225 million rate, wiping out a 5.6 percent loss a month earlier.

HEADLINE: Hondurans in 'Sweatshops' See Opportunity

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras, July 13

 BODY:
Each morning, the workers spill off the buses and past the guards at the front gates of the industrial parks here, rushing to punch the clock before the 7:30 start of their workday.
Outside, anxious onlookers are always waiting, hoping for a chance at least to fill out a job application that will allow them to become part of that throng. 
 With wages that start at less than 40 cents an hour, the apparel plants here offer little by American standards. But many of the people who work in them, having come from jobs that pay even less and offer no benefits or security, see employment here as the surest road to a better life.
"In the countryside, a peon is a peon for all of his life," said Yensy Melendez, 29, a father of two and former farm worker who migrated seven years ago to this bustling city of 350,000 near Honduras's Caribbean coast and now has a factory job. "Here, it's not perfect, but at least you have a chance to improve your situation."
What residents of a rich country like the United States see as exploitation can seem a rare opportunity to residents of a poor country like Honduras, where the per capita income is $600 a year and unemployment is 40 percent. Such conflicts of standards and perceptions have become increasingly common as the global economy grows more intertwined, and have set off a heated debate about international norms of conduct and responsibility.
The recent controversy involving the television personality Kathie Lee Gifford and a line of clothing made here that bears her name provides a widely publicized case in point.
To critics in the United States, the apparel assembly plants here, known in Spanish as maquiladoras, are merely "monstrous sweatshops of the New World Order," to use the phrase of the National Labor Committee, the New York-based group that originally accused Mrs. Gifford of turning a blind eye to Hondurans working for "slave wages."
The National Labor Committee, a nonprofit group, is largely financed by foundations but also receives money from labor unions in the United States.
After the attacks on her, Mrs. Gifford has now endorsed efforts to monitor and improve conditions in apparel plants around the world. But the debate over what constitutes adequate wages, what minimum working conditions should be required and at what age it becomes permissible for minors to work continues here and in other developing countries that have eagerly welcomed assembly plants as a source of employment for their poor.
Whether workers think they are better off in the assembly plants than elsewhere is not the real issue, argues Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labor Committee. Employers, he said, have a moral obligation to pay not merely what the market will bear, but a wage they know to be just.
 
Low Wage Rates Draw Criticism
 "The salaries being paid in a place like Honduras amount to less than 1 percent of the price of the garment in the United States," he said. "That's a crime." Companies could easily double their employees' wages, he added, and "it would be nothing."
But many of the people who work here and are most familiar with conditions in the plants argue that the situation in Honduras, at least, where about one-fifth of the clothing workers are unionized, is far more complicated than portrayed in the American debate over "sweatshops."
To make any kind of sweeping generalization is dangerous and misleading, many said during interviews here with more than 75 apparel workers and union leaders and visits to half a dozen plants, including the one that made clothes for the Gifford line.
Many here say critics from the north are more interested in protecting jobs in the United States than in improving the lot of Honduran workers.
Yes, workers and employers here say, some companies verbally abuse their workers on a regular basis, insist on compulsory overtime, impose unreachable production quotas or dismiss employees who become pregnant in order not to have to pay maternity benefits.
But other plants supply a subsidized lunch and free medical care to employees, are modern and air-conditioned, have agreed to union shops and generally respect workers' rights.
"You will find varying conditions and outlooks here," said Israel Salinas, president of the Federation of Independent Workers of Honduras, one of three rival labor groups seeking to organize the approximately 75,000 employees who work in the estimated 160 assembly plants in this country. "It all depends on whom you talk to and where you go."
 
A Worker's Escape From Rural Poverty
The story told by one apparel worker, Eber Orellana Vasquez, is not unusual. He is one of some 450 employees at the King Star Garment assembly plant just south of here, a Taiwanese-owned company that produces beach shirts, shorts and other sportswear for the United States market.
At 26 he is a veteran of three years as an apparel worker and a strong supporter of the union that represents the employees in their dealings with the company.
"This has been an enormous advance for me," Mr. Orellana said, "and I give thanks to the maquila for it. My monthly income is seven times what I made in the countryside, and I've gained 30 pounds since I started working here."
Before he became an apparel worker here, Mr. Orellana explained, he worked for a decade on a dairy ranch, milking and herding cows and living in a rented shack. "My only possession there was a bicycle," he said, so small was his salary.
Now, thanks to his job as a quality control checker, he owns a house of his own, "made of brick with a zinc roof," he noted proudly, in contrast to the flimsy wood and thatch roof dwellings that are the norm in the countryside, and has access to electricity and water.
He has been able to bring his wife and a younger brother, now 17, from the ranch and find them jobs in the plant.
"Every time I go to visit the ranch, everyone wants to come back with me," Mr. Orellana said. "The work there is very hard, exhausting. You get up at 1 o'clock in the morning to start your chores, and the bosses are always mean. If you drink too much milk, they will fire you."
 
Company Accused Of Rights Abuses
The clothes for the Kathie Lee Gifford line were produced by the Global Fashion plant at the South Korean-run Galaxy Industrial Park just north of town, which has been singled out by human rights advocates here and abroad as being especially harsh and abusive to workers.
In recent testimony to Congress, a former employee at the factory, Wendy Diaz, 15, said she had been forced to work up to 74 hours a week by supervisors who regularly screamed at, hit and sexually harassed employees.
"We knew that factory wasn't the greatest," Mr. Kernaghan said in a telephone interview from New York. "We knew that conditions were pretty rough there, that people were being fired for trying to organize, that it was not a good place, not near to being among the better factories in Honduras."
Wal-Mart, which markets Mrs. Gifford's line of clothes, has no production contracts at the moment with Global Fashion. But it continues to have clothing made under contract at numerous other apparel plants in Honduras, and is being pressed by the National Labor Committee to consent to an independent monitoring program.
In an interview at the plant, Paul Kim, president of Global Fashion, acknowledged that his company required compulsory overtime of its employees, had a high employee turnover rate and might demand more effort of workers than some other companies here.
But he denied Miss Diaz's charge of systematic abuse, and described the regimen here as a form of tough love that works for the good of all concerned.
"Korea used to be a poor country, like Honduras," Mr. Kim said, speaking in Korean through a Spanish-language interpreter, "but we have had a lot of development because we worked very hard. The more you work, the more you earn. That's what Central America needs if it is going to become prosperous."
 
An Industrial Boom Brings Labor Shortage
A decade ago, Honduras had virtually no assembly plants, and poor people had few options. Now, the factories have absorbed so many workers that they are creating labor shortages that have helped drive up wages for workers in other sectors, including agriculture, forestry, mining, fishing and even domestic work, traditionally the worst paid and most abusive.
"It used to be easy to get a nanny or a maid, but not now," said Jesus Canahuati, whose family owns an industrial park and several assembly plants here. "Everybody wants to work in the maquilas, because they represent an opportunity for a better life."
Within the apparel assembly industry itself, workers and employers agree, explosive growth has also encouraged the labor force to be on the move, always looking for the best offer. When workers do not like conditions where they are, both sides say, they often move to other jobs offering production incentives and increased benefits that in some cases double their base wage.
"If you don't pay more than the legal minimum, you don't get any employees," said Perry Keene, acting manager of Certified Apparel Services of Honduras, a plant here that makes infants' wear for department stores in the United States. "They will all go to other people, because it's a competitive labor market."
Another sharp difference of perspective surrounds the issue of teen-agers working in the assembly plants. The National Labor Committee and other critics in the United States contend that the practice, widespread here, is "destroying a whole generation of young women" and have called for American apparel concerns to stop doing business with all suppliers who hire children.
 
Honduran Unions Defend Child Labor
But all three of the leading labor federations here, including unions that have worked closely with the National Labor Committee in denouncing abuses of workers, disagree with that position.
Instead, acting in accordance with the demands of members whose own children are already working, they want the Honduran Government to enforce regulations that are already on the books.
Under Honduran law, adolescents between the ages of 14 and 16 can be employed for up to six hours a day. To do so, they must first obtain the permission of their parents, which is usually readily granted, and of the Labor Ministry, also easily obtained in a country in which education for the majority of the population ends at sixth grade.
"This country is not the United States," said Evangelina Argueta, a labor organizer in Choloma, a suburb just north of here with a large concentration of industrial parks. "Very few Honduran mothers can afford the luxury of feeding children until they are 18 years old without putting them to work."
Nevertheless, responding to complaints from the United States and to the fears of blacklisting that have arisen as a result, the Honduran Maquiladora Association says its members have now stopped hiring any workers under 16. Union leaders and workers say factory owners have also been reviewing their personnel records and dismissing all employees who are minors.
But that does not mean the dismissed youngsters are returning to school. On the contrary, management and labor agree that most of the children have instead sought new jobs outside the assembly sector that are lower paying and more physically demanding or are buying fake documents in an effort to sneak their way back into the apparel plants.
 
Campaign Brings Unintended Result
Mr. Kernaghan acknowledged that his group's effort to end child labor had produced unanticipated consequences. "Obviously this is not what we wanted to happen," he said.
He added that his group had discussed with Honduran factory owners an arrangement that would permit the 14- to 16-year-olds already employed to keep their jobs but shift future hiring toward adults.
"It's a tragic situation that needs to be resolved," he added. When asked how that should be done, he replied, "I may not be the right person to answer that kind of question, since I'm not an economist."
Many older workers who themselves began working at a young age assert that the American campaign may actually be hurting the very people it is intended to help.
Rene Javier Robertson, for example, left school at 13 to work as a fare collector on a bus "because with four kids besides me, my family needed me to work" and opportunities for teen-agers were limited.
"In 11 years on that job, I worked 14 hours a day, seven days a week, never got a day's vacation, didn't get paid when I was sick, and had to content myself with whatever wage the bus driver felt like paying me at the end of the day," said Mr. Robertson, who got a job on the assembly line three years ago and is now 27. "I was a slave, with no rights."
Teen-agers working at assembly plants "are a million times better off in here than out there on the street, because the maquila represents progress," Mr. Robertson added. "The work here isn't heavy, there are many benefits, and they have to respect your rights. I wish the maquila had existed when I started to work, because I could have avoided a lot of suffering."

HEADLINE: Pesticide Measure Advances In House, Without Rancor

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 17

 BODY:
With a remarkable absence of rancor, long-divided factions on the House Commerce Committee voted unanimously today for fundamental changes in the regulation of pesticides in food.
The bill's authors said it would strengthen Federal restrictions on chemical residues in the food that people buy. 
 In approving the compromise legislation, the committee members swept aside much of a proposal backed by the food, agricultural and pesticide industries and endorsed by most members of the House. Instead, they accepted provisions long sought by the Clinton Administration and environmental groups.
New standards for pesticides, calling for "reasonable certainty" that nobody would be harmed by consuming them, would apply to all food, whether it is bought in raw or processed form. Also, the exposure limits would be established at levels intended to protect infants and children.
The bill would eliminate the current absolute prohibition against potentially cancer-causing residues, no matter how slight, in certain processed foods. The decades-old requirement, known as the Delaney Clause, has been widely criticized for years as being scientifically unsupportable.
Under the measure, industry and Government officials predicted that public exposure to the riskiest chemicals sprayed on crops would be substantially reduced over the next 10 years, the time frame that the bill would establish for reviewing pesticide uses.
At the same time, safer pesticides should be more readily approved, theoretically improving the quality, availability and price of food.
Pesticides are regulated chemical by chemical and crop by crop after complicated and time-consuming reviews, and it is too early to predict whether general pesticide use would go down under the legislation. Certainly some chemicals that are currently permitted would be banned, officials said.
It is a political deal that took more than a decade to reach, but that Democrats and Republicans alike hope will now sail through a busy Congress before adjournment. Although there remain some unresolved details, President Clinton is expected to sign the legislation.
After House proposals to roll back environmental regulations ignited an intense backlash last year, the sudden breakthrough is the latest signal of a widespread feeling among members that it is politically crucial to enact strong environmental legislation before the November election.
The compromise was reached after weeks of negotiations led by Representatives Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia, and Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California. In a joint interview, they expressed confidence that the deal would hold.
Carol M. Browner, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said their bill "clearly strengthens the current law in ways that the Clinton Administration has been seeking for over three years now."
Given how long the pesticide issue has languished, the bill is now moving with unusual speed. A subcommittee passed it this morning by a voice vote. This afternoon, the full committee rubber-stamped it. The House leadership hopes to bring it to a vote, perhaps suspending the usual time-consuming rules of debate, early next week. A Senate committee will take up the issue next Wednesday.
Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, the leading Republican on agricultural issues in the Senate, and Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, his Democrat counterpart, both said they wanted to enact similar legislation.
The House bill won endorsements from many industry and environmental groups.
"It is not perfect, but it should be acceptable," said Timothy Willard, a spokesman for the National Food Processors Association, an industry group.
The Environmental Working Group, which has sought strict controls on pesticides and was involved in the negotiations, said the bill "will dramatically improve the way that pesticides are regulated in food."
It is the second time in a month that Mr. Bliley and Mr. Waxman, who have been bitter opponents over issues like tobacco, have come to terms over major environmental legislation. The other bill, involving drinking water purity, is still being debated in a conference committee.
In the pesticides bill, as in the water bill, Mr. Bliley gave in to Mr. Waxman on several major points.
The most critical was the quid pro quo for repealing the Delaney Clause. In exchange, Mr. Waxman won a new standard for protecting the public: that pesticides and additives may be approved on food only if there is a "reasonable certainty of no harm" from exposure to the chemicals.
Among the other changes that many environmentalists supported was one to protect children explicitly from exposure to pesticides, as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences. They also endorsed a provision to make more information about pesticides in food available to supermarket shoppers, including disclosures when pesticides have been permitted because banning them would cause too much economic harm to growers.
But some environmental groups objected to certain provisions of the legislation, and said they would seek changes in the Senate.
As an example, Mary Raftery, the legislative director for the California Public Interest Research Group, cited a provision that would prohibit states from setting standards that are stricter than those established by Federal law. California, with its big fruit and vegetable industries and a history of ballot initiatives to go beyond Federal health and safety standards, is the state most likely to be affected by the restriction in the House bill.

HEADLINE: About Real Estate;
On the Rise: Instant Selling Success

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
The New York City real estate market is full of tales of sellers who put their houses or apartments on the market, clean them every morning just in case an agent comes by with some eager buyers, only to wait and wait for an offer that seems to never come.
Although the last few years have been grim for many sellers -- average selling times have dragged out to over a year in some parts of the region -- there are now an increasing number of tales of instant selling success that give heart to the anxious seller. 
 These tales of split-second success -- referred to by one real estate company executive as "here today, gone tomorrow" -- seem to give weight to what sales agents have been saying lately: if a property has what it takes -- a fair price, a desirable location and, often, move-in condition -- one morning's wait may be all that is required.
The William B. May Company, a real estate broker in Manhattan and Brooklyn, issued a lengthy list this week of deals that took place in record time, including one for a four-story, one-family house at 295 Sterling Place in the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn that sold for the full price of $449,000 in 20 minutes.
Another house, at 167 East 94th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues in the Carnegie Hill section had multiple offers the first day and sold for the full price of $1.25 million.
What happened with the Carnegie Hill house was not uncommon in this summer's market, brokers say. The buyers had been looking for exactly this type of five-story house, in exactly this neighborhood, for months.
When it came on the market, both broker and buyer jumped.
Echoing the remarks of other real estate company executives, Peter Marra, William B. May's president, cited what he termed "the current fear of losing out."
"People now may have missed a few things," he said. "There was a big surge of accepted offers in the fourth quarter of 1995 and the first part of 1996, and there's not a lot of good stuff around."
Marc Broxmeyer, a partner in Bellmarc Realty, agreed. "There's very little product available," he said, adding that Bellmarc sold more apartments this year than in any similar period in its 17-year history.
"People are just waiting, waiting for a specific apartment or a specific building or a specific neighborhood. They know exactly what they want; they're educated because they've lost out. They're ready to do it."
Mr. Broxmeyer listed two of his company's sales: a two-bedroom apartment on East 8th Street near University Place that sold for $430,000 -- the asking price was $460,000 -- in only one day, with several people bidding. A convertible two bedroom -- one bedroom and a dining area -- on East 40th Street near Third Avenue sold in a day for $257,000, only a few thousand dollars less than the asking price of $259,000.
Despite the euphoria, brokers are quick to caution that not every apartment put on the market sells.
Clark Halstead, who runs the Halstead Property Company, said that a property had to be priced right at the beginning or it would not sell for a long time. Sellers who try to test the water with higher prices and plan to come down later may find themselves with a property perceived as shopworn to the brokerage community, Mr. Halstead said.
Besides price, an apartment or town house must be in the right location and preferably have an unusual feature that is in demand, said Alan Rogers, managing director of the Douglas Elliman real estate brokerage firm. "Right now, there's a whole group looking for double-height living rooms," he said, "and when a double-height living room comes up, there's a stampede."
Brokers say they have waiting lists for huge prewar apartments in posh Park or Fifth Avenue co-op buildings, and for any size apartments with exquisite outdoor terraces suitable for entertaining.
Barbara Corcoran, president of the Corcoran Group, a real estate firm, related several examples of one-day sales, including one on East 9th Street in Greenwich Village: a 600-square-foot one bedroom with a 1,000-square-foot terrace.
"It was bought by a famous European designer," she said, "who was the first one in the door. He paid the full asking price of $410,000 -- and nobody else even got to see it."
Many brokers report that prices are, on average, higher than they were a few years ago, at the depth of the real estate recession.
"There are no steals," Mr. Rogers said, "but where there is pent-up demand and so many people waiting for new product, especially if it is a particular type of apartment they want or in the building they want, they will run to go see it." Then, if it is fairly priced, they will take it, he said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Mixed on Trade Data, Greenspan and German Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished mixed against leading currencies yesterday, after being buffetted by trade data, speculation about German interest rates and testimony from Alan Greenspan.
A rally in the United States bond market failed to lift the dollar. 
 "The dollar made a couple of attempts to go higher with bonds, but on each occasion fell" to profit taking, said John Rothfield, an international economist with Nationsbanc-CRT in Chicago.
In late trading in New York, the dollar stood at 1.4920 German marks, up from 1.4857 marks on Wednesday. The dollar also traded at 108.46 yen, just down from 108.68. The British pound was unchanged at $1.5455.
The dollar tumbled in early trading in New York after a report of a lower United States trade deficit with Japan raised speculation about an increase in Japanese interest rates, which typically would make the yen more attractive.
But the dollar then gained on expectations for lower German interest rates after a widely watched German confidence survey from the Ifo economic research institute showed that business managers lost confidence in June after two months of brightening prospects.
The survey helped revive speculation that the Bundesbank would need to cut interest rates to stimulate the German economy. Such a view had subsided in recent days, particularly after the Dutch central bank decided on Friday to raise an important interest rate, which suggested that rate-cutting in Europe had ended for the moment.
But the report and recent comments from Bundesbank officials have led some traders to expect that the central bank would lower its 14-day repurchase rate as soon as next Thursday.
Mr. Rothfield of Nationsbanc-CRT said the mark fell as investors turned to the Spanish peseta, the Swedish krona and the Italian lira, moves helpful to the dollar along with the rally in the stocks and bonds.
The dollar fell in the afternoon after investors decided that Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, had hinted that a rise in short-term interest rates was not imminent.
The markets had assumed the Fed would tighten rates at its Aug. 20 policy-making committee meeting, if not sooner, to offset inflation amid growing signs of a stronger economy.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday: 1.2198 Swiss francs, up from 1.2121; 5.0335 French francs, up from 5.0325 and 1,518 Italian lire, down from 1,520.

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Approves a New Plan To Allow Iraq to Start Selling Oil

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, July 18

 BODY:
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali approved an amended Iraqi plan today for distributing food and other relief supplies bought with proceeds from oil to be sold under an exemption to international sanctions.
The Secretary General's approval of the reworked plan, which the United States had criticized in its original form as being full of loopholes and evasions, removes a major hurdle to the signing of Iraqi oil contracts. 
 Diplomats and United Nations officials said today that the original Iraqi distribution proposals had been rewritten here to meet American objections, then sent back to Baghdad.
Iraq agreed in May to accept a 1995 offer contained in a Security Council resolution allowing up to $2 billion in oil to be sold for relief supplies over a six-month period. The exemption is renewable.
If a Security Council committee also approves the distribution plan and other proposals governing technical details of sales, all that remains to be done is to hire professional monitors to oversee the oil contracts and relief officials to verify that all supplies are reaching the needy.
Edward W. Gnehm Jr., the deputy United States representative at the United Nations, who was Ambassador to Kuwait during the Persian Gulf war, said he was confident that the original intent of the exemption could be preserved under this plan.
But he cautioned that experience with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had taught diplomats to be guarded.
"We don't think for a moment that there aren't going to be problems," Mr. Gnehm said. "We intend to remain as vigilant and as careful and as hard-nosed in the future as we have been in the past."
Events today seemed to underline his point. The approval came on the same day that international weapons monitors in Baghdad had to suspend operations because the Iraqis were blocking a site accessible only through what the Iraqis called a "presidential area."
Rolf Ekeus, the Swedish diplomat who is chairman of the commission disposing of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, said today that this was a new rationale for noncooperation from the Iraqis. On June 24, Iraq signed an agreement with Mr. Ekeus pledging to give United Nations investigators "immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access."
Until Mr. Ekeus's commission has finished its work, Iraq cannot hope for a lifting of the economic sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The commission believes that the Iraqis may still be concealing weapons and that searches must continue.
To plug any loopholes in the plan, a letter today to the Iraqi negotiator, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, from a senior adviser to Mr. Boutros-Ghali made clear that the approval was granted on condition that the plan adhered to Security Council resolutions.
The letter also noted that the Council sanctions committee -- on which all Council members sit -- would have the last word on goods Iraq wanted to import with money from the oil sales.
The United States had charged that Iraq wanted to import high-technology equipment that did not qualify as aid for the Iraqi people, who have suffered from the lack of medicines, food and other daily necessities as a result of the United Nations sanctions.
Diplomats and officials say they are reluctant to estimate when all the pieces of the oil-for-food plan will be in place and oil can be pumped, but Mr. Anbari said today that the Iraqis were "ready to go tomorrow."

Faced with reprisals by the European Union, Canada and Mexico, President Clinton chose to retreat from enforcing the most obnoxious section of the Helms-Burton Act, which imposes new sanctions against Cuba. He could have waived the section, known as Title III, for six months. Title III says that any foreigner who "trafficks" in American property seized by Cuba will be judged as causing damage to former owners, including Cubans who have since become American citizens.
He did not waive Title III. What he did do was suspend the right to sue foreigners for damages in American courts for six months -- until Feb. 1, well after American elections. Under this compromise, confected by the Administration's legal wizards, the President has embraced a principle dear to Cuban-American hard-liners in Florida while blunting its enforcement. 
 Still, judging by the initial reaction, Mr. Clinton's face-both-ways maneuver is merely feeding the controversy it was supposed to quell. Europeans, Canadians and Mexicans view Helms-Burton as an attempt to impose United States domestic law on their countries in order to enforce an American trade embargo against Cuba that enjoys virtually no international support.
They note, correctly, that Washington has historically opposed such secondary boycotts and worry that the Senate has approved an amendment that would employ the same weapon against Iran and Libya. They are especially affronted by a provision barring foreigners and their families from entering America if an adult member has "trafficked" in property confiscated by Cuba. In reprisal, the European Union approved a range of countermeasures this week, including requiring visas for American business travelers.
Mr. Clinton insists that isolating and bludgeoning Cuba will hasten democratization, a view shared by hard-line Cuban-Americans. But Europeans, Canadians and Mexicans ask why America's Cuban strategy differs so radically from its approach to other Communist states. Trade and political engagement hastened the collapse of the Soviet empire, and Washington now advocates a similar approach to China. Why sow ill will and risk reprisals over a bill that even the Administration only half-heartedly defends?

HEADLINE: Marco Rivetti, 52, Marketer Of Italian Designer Labels

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Marco Rivetti, the Italian entrepreneur who helped turn European designer labels into household names worldwide, died last Saturday at his home in Turin. He was 52.
The cause was lung cancer, said Group G.F.T. in Turin, the family business he headed as chairman and chief executive officer through its heyday in the 1980's. 
 Mr. Rivetti provided the vision that made the distinctive creations of Armani or Valentino, to name but two, popular in the United States. His skill as a merchandiser of fashions introduced Italian-made fashions to many upscale department stores and boutiques.
G.F.T. -- the Gruppo Finanziario Tessile -- started decades earlier as a supplier of uniforms. It was largely to his credit that it grew into a dynamo of haute couture humming in New York and Tokyo and other fashion-conscious capitals.
Mr. Rivetti joined his father, Franco, in the business in 1970. His knack for marketing first became evident when he approached Emanuel Ungaro.
Other arbiters of style soon joined the fold, like Giorgio Armani and Valentino Garavani, Claude Montana, Joseph Abboud and Calvin Klein menswear. Mr. Rivetti offered attractive licensing agreements, reportedly with double-digit royalties and cushions to protect the designers from the often painful ups and downs at the sales counter.
In the 1980's, the apparel industry became a pillar of Italy's export business, thanks largely to houses like the fashion conglomerate G.F.T. The top designer labels sold at almost any price in the affluent countries of western Europe and North America, and big buyers jostled at ready-to-wear shows in Italy.
By the late 1980's, G.F.T. was the world's largest maker of designer labels. It struck out into manufacturing in the United States, China and Czechoslovakia and rang up record sales of just over $1 billion in 1989.
But the economic climate eventually soured. Mr. Rivetti's fashion strategy was tripped up by overextension and royalty arrangements, rising labor costs and a bewildering sprawl of the market in Asia. The company that almost single-handedly wakened the taste for Italian designs in the United States went into debt. In 1991, for the first time in 61 years, it lost money.
Mr. Rivetti gave up the helm that year, saying: "I'm not capable of managing difficult moments." He engaged an outsider, Vittorio Levi, to take his place as chief executive officer. That, too, was a first for the family, which later put the company up for sale.
In 1994, the next year, after several false starts, the banks that had been trying to rescue the company found a solution. An investment arm of the Fiat group, Gemina, bought G.F.T. and managed to turn a net profit of $11 million in 1995, the first black ink on the bottom at G.F.T. in four years.
Marco Rivetti was born in Turin. He studied economics in Italy and the United States. He served as president until last year of Pitti Immagine, an organization that holds several Italian trade shows.
He is survived by a sister, Giovanna Rivetti.

HEADLINE: Former Scott Paper Chief Named To Top Position at Sunbeam

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., July 18

 BODY:
The Sunbeam Corporation said today that it had hired Albert Dunlap, the former chief executive of the Scott Paper Company, who is known as an aggressive cost-cutter, to try to turn the appliance maker around.
The 58-year-old executive succeeded Roger Schipke, as chairman and chief executive, who quit in May after failing to increase profits. Hurt by higher material costs, shipping difficulties and a slowdown in consumer spending, Sunbeam's earnings fell 42 percent in the first quarter. 
 Analysts had criticized Mr. Schipke for failing to increase sales by introducing new products or making acquisitions. Separate departments were often at odds and failed to work toward one goal, they said.
"The company's No. 1 problem has been lack of a strategic plan, and its No. 2 problem is accountability," said William Steele, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. "There is no question that Al is a taskmaster with those issues," he said of Mr. Dunlap.
In his 18 months as Scott Paper's chief executive, Mr. Dunlap dismissed about 11,000 workers -- one-third of the employees -- and sold $2 billion of assets before selling the company to the Kimberly-Clark Corporation for $9 billion. The same treatment is expected at Sunbeam, whose earnings have fallen below expectations in five of the last six quarters.
"He's going to get to work his magic on Sunbeam by holding managers accountable for their budgets and projections," Mr. Steele said. "A restructuring is imminent within the next three months."
Mr. Dunlap said he would buy $3 million of Sunbeam stock, and Sunbeam said the company's shares would be a major part of his pay package.
Trading of Sunbeam stock was halted on the New York Stock Exchange this afternoon before the announcement of Mr. Dunlap's appointment. The stock last traded at $12.50, well below its 52-week high of $20.125, reached in March. Sunbeam's shares have risen only 4.9 percent a year since 1992, far less than the 16 percent annual increase in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.

HEADLINE: Burmese Dissident Urges Western Sanctions to Oust Military

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, July 18

 BODY:
In a videotape smuggled out of Myanmar and made public today, the campaigner for democracy and winner of the Nobel prize, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, issued a call for international sanctions to be imposed on her country to force political change on the military rulers.
"What we want are the kind of sanctions that will make it quite clear that economic change in Burma is not possible without political change," Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said in the videotape, which was shown by members of the European Parliament. 
 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi dismissed fears that sanctions would hurt ordinary Burmese. "I think that the only people whom sanctions will affect are the privileged ones," she said.
Her appeal coincides with mounting pressure in the West for action against the rulers of Myanmar, who cracked down on the democracy movement in May.
In Strasbourg, France, members of the European Parliament passed a non-binding resolution today urging the European Union to end all trade, tourism and investment ties with Myanmar.
So far the European Union has resisted sanctions, with many countries arguing that without similar moves from China and other Asian nations, sanctions would be meaningless.
But Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi differentiated between Asian investment and potential investment by the European Union and the United States.
Asians, she said, invested mainly in hotels, department stores and tourist-related businesses. "These, of course, are only related to the very privileged groups," she said, while Western investment would be in the basic projects that Myanmar needs if it is to grow economically.
She said sanctions would help the democracy movement by discouraging investors. "Good business anywhere is very much dependent on confidence," she said. "We think this is the time for concerted international efforts with regard to the democratic process in Burma."
The videotape, which European Parliament officials said was filmed within the last two weeks, also showed Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi addressing supporters.
Pressure has been growing on governments and companies to shun Myanmar. The Carlsberg and Heineken breweries both announced earlier this month they were ending business dealings there after pro-democracy groups called for a boycott of the companies' products.
Within the European Union, Denmark has been the driving force for sanctions, after the June 22 death in prison of James Leander Nichols, its honorary consul in Yangon, the capital.
Mr. Nichols, who also represented Finland, Norway and Switzerland, was Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's godfather. She did not mention the incident in the video.
The United States has also expressed concern. Secretary of State Warren Christopher plans to consult his counterparts from the Association of South-East Asian Nations on the issue when he meets them this weekend in Jakarta, Indonesia.
But the secretary general of Asean, Ajit Singh, said today that Myanmar would not be an issue.
"The West and the media are going on a witch hunt," he said, because Myanmar "is not an issue at all as far as Asean is concerned."
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi also announced through a spokesman today that she would attend a government-run ceremony on Friday to mark the anniversary of her father's assassination.
The ceremony marks the date, July 19, 1947, when her father, Gen. Aung San, and eight other leaders of the pro-independence movement were killed as they prepared for the end of British rule.
If Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had shunned the ceremony, it might have been seen as an affront to the military at a time when relations between the opposition and the Government are already strained.

Lower Costs, Better Sales Bolster Sears

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 18

 BODY:
Sears, Roebuck & Company reported today that its performance was strong in the second quarter, a result of lower costs and robust sales at its Sears stores and furniture, hardware and other specialty stores.
Although net earnings were down 51 percent compared with the similar period a year earlier -- $274 million, or 67 cents a share, versus $559 million, or $1.41 a share -- the 1995 quarter included gains from the spinoff of Allstate Insurance Group and the sale of the Homart Development Company. Without those one-time gains, Sears's profit in last year's quarter was $218 million, or 54 cents a share. 
 The most recent results exceeded Wall Street expectations. Analysts had been expecting profits of about 64 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call.
Sears operates more than 800 department stores and 1,500 specialty stores. Its stock rose 25 cents yesterday, closing at $46.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.
"This was a nice clean quarter, typical of Sears, with strong sales throughout the company and margin improvement beyond what I expected," said Peter Schaeffer, an analyst with Dillon, Read & Company.
Sears continued to outperform its competitors because of its apparel business, which was revamped in recent years, and strong sales of hard goods like appliances and hardware.
The company, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., a Chicago suburb, said sales rose 11 percent, to $9.13 billion. Sales at stores open more than a year rose 9.4 percent. Such sales are considered a more reliable gauge of a retailer's performance.
At Sears stores, sales were especially strong in appliances, and all apparel segments had significant increases.
The retailer's specialty chains like Homelife furniture, Sears hardware and Sears dealer stores had same-store sales growth of more than 11 percent.
Gross margin rose to 26.4 percent of sales from 25.8 percent. Selling, general and administrative costs narrowed to 21.3 percent of sales from 21.8 percent in the quarter a year earlier.
Sears said its operating loss at its international operations -- Canada and Mexico -- widened to $14 million from $2 million. The company attributed the loss to weak economic conditions and competitive pressures in those countries.

HEADLINE: Detroit Mayor Leads Democrats In Attack on Dole Urban Policy

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 18

 BODY:
Hours before Bob Dole arrived here this afternoon, the city's Mayor attacked the Republican Presidential candidate's urban policies, part of a new and organized effort by Democratic mayors to criticize Mr. Dole as he campaigns across the country.
Mayor Dennis W. Archer, who is president of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors and co-chairman of the Democratic National Convention's platform committee, issued an open letter to Mr. Dole, calling attention to policies that he supported and that are unpopular here. 
 Mr. Archer criticized plans by the Republican-controlled Congress to cut summer job programs and college student subsidies. He asked Mr. Dole whether he would pledge to put 100,000 police officers on the nation's streets, as President Clinton promised in his 1994 anti-crime bill. And after noting that 80 percent of Detroit's residents are members of minorities, the Mayor pressed Mr. Dole for his views on affirmative action.
"Would you end it as promised in earlier speeches, or would you mend it?" Mr. Archer asked.
Nelson Warfield, the Dole campaign spokesman, dismissed the Mayor's attacks, saying, "We never expected to win 100 percent of the vote, and I think Mayor Archer was lost to us a long time ago."
Since Mr. Dole began campaigning full time after resigning from the Senate in June, the Clinton campaign has been urging Democratic officials to attack his record as he travels nationwide, said Ann F. Lewis, the Clinton campaign's deputy manager.
"We do encourage state and local elected officials to speak out on the issues," she said. "They have the credibility; they have the stature."
While Mr. Archer is the most prominent Mayor so far to attack Mr. Dole, he is not the first. Last month Mayor Jerry E. Abramson of Louisville, Ky., issued a similar open letter to Mr. Dole as the candidate began his campaign in the Midwest.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees Robust Growth Slowing Down

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said today that the robust economic growth of recent months should moderate later this year, but he warned that the central bank might have to raise interest rates anyway to insure that the slowdown happened promptly enough to avert a surge in inflation.
Investors interpreted Mr. Greenspan's remarks as a reprieve from the threat of an immediate rate increase, but many economists drew the opposite conclusion and said Mr. Greenspan was providing the markets with an unusually clear warning that the Fed was close to a decision to tighten monetary policy. 
 "Mr. Greenspan was putting the markets clearly on notice that the Fed is on track for a policy tightening, most likely sooner rather than later," said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Salomon Brothers.
In testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan, as is usual in his public statements, gave no explicit statements about the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rates.
But while he painted a picture of an economy in which there has been no rise in inflation despite the unexpectedly strong growth rate of the first half of the year, he cited a number of warning signs. He suggested that economic indicators due in coming weeks, including assessments of job growth and wage increases, could lead the Fed to a pre-emptive strike against inflation by raising rates this summer.
"The economy is already producing at a high level, and some early signs of pressures on resources are emerging, especially in the labor market," Mr. Greenspan said.
Despite a lack of upward pressure so far on either consumer or industrial commodity prices, Mr. Greenspan added, "there are early indications that this episode of favorable inflation developments, especially with regard to labor markets, may be drawing to a close."
Mr. Greenspan said the Fed considered itself to be in a state of "heightened surveillance" and that signs the economy was slowing would have to "become evident within the period immediately ahead" to allay concerns about building inflationary pressures.
"We don't see any acceleration, but it's still too early to basically argue that the relative exuberance that we saw in the spring and early summer has simmered down as yet, so that there is a very legitimate concern at this particular point about where the economy is heading," Mr. Greenspan said. "And I don't think anybody knows for sure."
Mr. Greenspan also characterized the recent volatility on Wall Street as a normal process in which investors, after a long run-up in stock prices, were adjusting their expectations to fit an evolving and somewhat confusing economic situation.
"I think the reason why the most recent volatility has caught our attention is that we haven't had much of that in recent years, and it is that which is unusual, not the most recent period," Mr. Greenspan said.
The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee is scheduled to meet next on Aug. 20. But some analysts believe it may raise interest rates even earlier if new data indicate that the economy is continuing to expand at a relatively rapid pace. But any such increase is expected to be modest, perhaps only a quarter point.
The Fed last raised the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans, by a half-point, on Feb. 1, 1995. Since then, all of its moves have been to lower rates, ending with a quarter-point cut on Jan. 31, when many analysts were predicting the economy was heading into a recession. Currently, the Fed's target rate for Fed funds is 5.25 percent.
Any public analysis of the economy by Mr. Greenspan is seized on by investors and analysts for clues to the direction of monetary policy. But his testimony today, part of his semiannual report to Congress, was scrutinized especially closely because of the jittery state of the financial markets and because the economy appears balanced between overheating and throttling back to a sustainable growth pace.
Under those circumstances, Mr. Greenspan was uncharacteristically direct in addressing the economy's strengths and weaknesses and in providing analysts with a road map to the Fed's decision-making process over coming weeks.
On the plus side, Mr. Greenspan said, inflation is "quiescent" and "there are a number of reasons to expect demand to moderate and economic activity to settle back toward a more sustainable pace in the months ahead."
Among the factors that would cool off the economy, he said, were the increase over the last four months in long-term interest rates, the surging strength of the dollar and a petering out of spending by consumers and businesses.
So far, though, no evidence of a slowdown has materialized, Mr. Greenspan said, even in the housing sector, the part of the economy most sensitive to rising long-term interest rates.
On the minus side, Mr. Greenspan flagged several specific warning signals of incipient inflation. He said businesses had reduced their inventories to very low levels, and that companies might rebuild their stocks if they encountered delays in getting parts and supplies they need to keep their production lines running.
"Indeed, indications of some mounting delivery delays in June do raise warning flags in this regard," Mr. Greenspan said.
Moreover, Mr. Greenspan said, the combination of low unemployment with strong growth is beginning to put pressure on wages, a development that often sets off an inflationary cycle by encouraging companies to raise prices to maintain their profit margins.
"The surprising strength in the employment cost index for wages and salaries in the first quarter raises the possibility that workers' willingness to surrender wage gains for job security may be lessening," he said.
"Clearly, in this environment, the Federal Reserve has had to become especially vigilant to incipient inflation pressures that could ultimately threaten the health of the expansion," the Fed chairman said. "The relatively good inflation performance of the past few years, as best we can judge, owes in part to transitional forces that are only temporarily dampening the wage-price inflation process."
By specifying the potential bottlenecks he is monitoring, Mr. Greenspan was telling the markets what economic indicators the Fed would study most closely in coming to a decision on whether to tighten policy at or before its next scheduled meeting on Aug. 20.
First is the employment cost index for the second quarter, which is to be issued on July 30. On Aug. 1 comes the National Association of Purchasing Managers report, which contains data on lead times for deliveries of parts and supplies. And on Aug. 2 come data on how many jobs the economy added in July.
"I read Greenspan as saying the Fed does not yet have quite enough evidence in terms of inflationary pressures to move, but that it will not have much patience if the economy continues to grow at a rate close to its rate in the first half," said Paul L. Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit Jumps Again, Particularly With China

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit surged in May for the third consecutive month, to $10.88 billion, the Commerce Department reported today. It said that China nearly supplanted Japan for the first time as the country with the biggest surplus in trade with the United States.
The overall deficit rose by 13.2 percent, from a revised total of $9.61 billion in April, as a resurgent American economy produced a buying spree of imported cars, toys and clothing. 
 The May tally marked the highest monthly gap between imports and exports since the agency made changes in January 1992 in how it reports the figures. It also might have been the largest monthly imbalance since the last quarter of 1987, but department officials said it was impossible to say for sure, given the record-keeping changes.
Most analysts were surprised at how much the trade deficit had shot up since bottoming out in the $6 billion to $7 billion range last fall and early this year. Some said the increase could give Republicans a new lever to challenge President Clinton's trade policies, especially the handling of disputes with China.
The deficit with China jumped by 31 percent in May, to $3.06 billion, as American consumers bought more than four times as much from China, ranging from toys to footwear, as that country took in from American suppliers.
By contrast, the gap in trade with Japan, which has typically been America's largest with a single country, fell by 23.7 percent in May, to $3.13 billion, as Americans bought substantially less and sold more there.
But the latest figures also carried a measure of good news for the Administration, as Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor was quick to note.
While the overall value of imports jumped 2.6 percent in May to a record $80.64 billion, exports of goods and services also hit a record, rising 1.1 percent, to $69.76 billion.
Mr. Kantor said both numbers reflected the effects of the recent strength in the economy. He said the growth in exports of American goods had created thousands of high-paying jobs, while a bigger surge in imports was inevitable "when you have an economy that's stronger than your major trading partners."
Still, several private economists said the increase in the deficit could be a sign that American factories might not be producing quite as much as they had projected. And some said that as a result they would cut their estimates of the growth in the nation's gross domestic product in the second quarter.
"The one-word summary is 'surprising,' from the standpoint of the deterioration in the deficit," said Michael P. Niemira, an economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. He said he was cutting his estimate of second-quarter growth to about 3 1/2 percent from 4 percent.
Mr. Niemira said that if economic growth slowed, as is widely expected later this year, the growth in imports would also slow. But while many economists had predicted that the overall trade deficit would fall this year, Mr. Niemira said he now thought that it could increase by $15 billion to $20 billion, from $105.1 billion last year.
Other economists said the increase in the trade deficit could also help push down the value of the dollar.
Still, other analysts cautioned against reading too much into the month-to-month changes. And some said that what happened with the big picture would also reflect the outcome of the increasingly intriguing subplot involving China and Japan.
 Dr. Sherry Cooper, the chief economist at Nesbitt Burns, a Canadian investment firm, said it appeared that "a momentous shift in regional trade patterns is under way -- China is poised to replace Japan as the U.S.'s biggest bilateral deficit partner."
Mr. Kantor said America's trade deficit with Japan had seen "steady improvement" since June 1995 for a variety of reasons, ranging from currency exchange rates to new agreements to open Japan's markets.
Japanese auto makers have also moved more production to the United States, and exports of American autos to Japan surged in the first five months of this year, while imports from Japan dropped.
Indeed, the overall May trade figures show that most of a $966 million increase in the value of imported autos and auto parts was a result of purchases from manufacturers in Canada, Mexico and Germany rather than in Japan.
By contrast, America's trade deficit with China has been growing in recent months. The Administration has been battling to stop Chinese piracy of American music, movies and computer software and to increase American exports to China.
The figures released today also showed a sharp increase in America's trade deficit with Canada, which jumped 53 percent in May, to $2.55 billion, and a 1.7 percent increase in the deficit with Mexico, to $1.59 billion.
Purchases of crude oil from overseas added to the increase in imports in May, as they rose 6.5 percent, to $4.6 billion, the highest level since November 1990.
Commerce Department officials said that while they had long recorded imports and exports of goods like autos and oil on a monthly basis, before 1992 they tallied the trade in services only on a quarterly basis. That is why it was impossible to determine with certainty when the overall monthly deficit last hit the current level.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	Japan's Surplus Shrinks
TOKYO, July 18 (Reuters) -- Japan's trade surplus fell in June for the 19th consecutive month, shrinking 26 percent, the Finance Ministry said today.
But the decrease was smaller than expected, and analysts said they expected the rate of decline to continue to slow, partly because of the dollar's relative strength.
The surplus fell to 737.110 billion yen, or $6.8 billion, from 989.57 billion yen in June 1995. Exports rose 7.4 percent, to 3.665 trillion yen from 3.413 trillion yen, while imports grew by 21 percent, to 2.928 trillion yen from 2.424 trillion.
The trade surplus with the United States fell 18 percent -- the 16th consecutive monthly decline -- to 296.11 billion yen, or $2.7 billion, from 360.76 billion yen. Japan's exports to the United States totaled 988.10 billion yen, up 7.3 percent from 920.95 billion yen, and its imports from the United States were 691.99 billion yen, up 24 percent from 560.19 billion yen.

HEADLINE: Blood Ties

BYLINE: By Linda Hodges; Linda Hodges is a food and travel writer.

DATELINE: AMES, Iowa

 BODY:
If the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 had been law when my husband and I were ready to start our family, we could not have raised our son.
In 1969, we read an article in The New York Times about the need for permanent homes for American Indian children. We had a strong interest in Indian culture, so we specifically requested an Indian baby. 
 When we learned that the Arizona Department of Public Welfare had approved us for a 4-month-old Apache boy, we checked the circumstances. His mother was 22, unmarried, an alcoholic and had two older children. We didn't think to ask whether she had an extended family that could raise him.
The Indian Child Welfare Act all but ended adoptions like ours. Under the law, when an Indian mother relinquishes her child, "in the absence of good cause to the contrary," her extended family receives special preference for adoption, followed by other members of her tribe, then by other Indian groups. If her tribe opposed it, she couldn't relinquish her child to a white family.
State courts, however, have differed in their interpretation of "good cause to the contrary." There have been instances where placing a child in a Caucasian home has been in itself considered "good cause."
Congress is debating whether to weaken or to strengthen the Indian Child Welfare Act. In May, the House passed the Adoption Promotion and Stability Act, intended to make adoption more affordable and to ease all interracial adoptions. Indian rights groups opposed a provision of the bill that would have weakened the Indian Child Welfare Act: the amendment would have limited tribal jurisdiction to those Indian children whose biological parents had significant social, cultural or political ties to the tribe.
In the Senate, the Committee on Indian Affairs scrapped the provision. On Tuesday, Senator John McCain of Arizona introduced a substitute bill, supported by Indian tribes and adoption lawyers, that insures that tribes will be informed when any Indian child is placed for adoption though it limits the time they have to respond.
It may sound odd, but I'm happy that the Senate version is the one likely to prevail, because my son's recent reunion with his birth family convinces me that its approach is better.
Like many adopted children, Andrew wanted to learn about his origins. Last May, at age 26, he met his birth family for the first time. The photos he brought back from the reservation show a world far different from the quiet Midwestern university town where he was raised: brush-covered hills dotted with ancient saguaro cactus, modest homes whose front yards are filled with worn-out cars, women wearing traditional dresses preparing traditional foods.
Andrew learned that both his parents died years ago in alcohol-related incidents, but he found a brother, grandmother, great-grandmother and dozens of aunts, uncles and cousins. They gave him a welcome-home party and showered him with gifts. He felt comfortable with them. Only the language they usually spoke set him apart. He enrolled in the tribe, is thinking of moving to the reservation and wants to be buried in the cemetery where his birth parents rest.
He learned that his family never wanted his mother to sign him away. He was told that her decision to relinquish two of her three children for placement in non-Indian homes caused such a rift with her family that, while under the influence of alcohol, she took an overdose of sleeping pills and died. The family never stopped searching for the missing children.
Although Andrew grew up happy in our home, the positive change in my son once he touched his roots, and the ease into which he entered the lives of his large family, makes me think that the pull of the ingrained cultural memory is stronger than even the most loving adoptive bonds.
Before lawmakers encourage adoptions of Indian children by non-Indian families, before they remove tribal jurisdiction over child custody proceedings, before state courts interpret "good cause" as economic superiority, they need to acknowledge the strength of the biological and cultural ties that Indian tribes can offer their own children.

HEADLINE: Stocks Surge on Comments by Greenspan

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks racked up their biggest gains in four months yesterday as investors interpreted comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to mean that an increase in interest rates was not imminent.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 87.30 points, or 1.62 percent, at 5,464.18 -- its largest one-day gain since March 18, when it shot up 99 points. In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 1,872 to 651 on active volume of 474 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 "The perception now is that the Fed won't do anything immediately," said Eugene Peroni, chief technical analyst at Janney, Montgomery Scott. "The bond market got a nice shot in the arm and stocks rallied nicely."
The Nasdaq composite index rose by 23.17 points, or 2.13 percent, to 1,109.82 after closing up 33.18 points on Wednesday -- its biggest one-day rise ever.
While bond prices gained on Mr. Greenspan's comments that the Fed remained vigilant on inflation, stocks benefited from the perception that no rate increase was immediately around the corner.
Recent speculation had held that the central bank would raise interest rates as soon as August after a report early this month showed that unemployment had fallen in June to a six-year low and that hourly earnings had posted their biggest rise since record-keeping began 31 years ago.
Wall Street had expected Mr. Greenspan to tip his hand during his testimony before the Senate, believing that he would have to explain any move to Congress so soon before the national election in November.
In his testimony, Mr. Greenspan said that "even though the U.S. economy is using its productive resources intensively, inflation has remained quiescent."
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond jumped more than a full point, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction to the price, fell to 6.92 percent from 7.02 percent on Wednesday.
Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany, said Wall Street was relieved that the Fed had "re-established itself as an inflation-fighter."
"I would expect July employment and price data will be important" to the Fed for a decision on rates, Mr. Johnson said, at the Aug. 20 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.
He said that if no rise came in August, a tightening was unlikely before the election.
Technology stocks, and the overall market, had been rocked in recent sessions by dismal earnings reports or warnings of poor results from companies like Motorola, Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments.
But earnings from Intel on Tuesday and from Apple Computer late on Wednesday somewhat restored the shaken faith of technology investors.
Stocks of companies that are sensitive to interest rates jumped yesterday. Citicorp rose 3 1/8, to 81 7/8; Fannie Mae was up 2 1/2, to 33 1/4, and Chase Manhattan added 1 3/4, to 69 1/2.
AT&T, the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, fell 2 1/4, to 54 1/8, after it reported its earnings and made bearish comments about competitive pressures in the residential long-distance telephone business.
T.W.A. fell 1, to 10 1/4, after a Paris-bound jetliner exploded off Long Island, with all the passengers aboard presumed dead.
Thermedics rose 3, to 25 1/4. Gruntal & Company repeated a buy recommendation, saying the T.W.A. crash might pressure the Government to install at American airports a bomb detection system that Thermedics makes.
McDonald's rose 1 1/8, to 45 3/8, after reporting quarterly results that topped analysts' expectations.
Xybernaut, a maker of mobile computing systems, rose 12, to 17 1/2, in its first day of trading.
Merck & Company rose 1 5/8, to 64 3/8, on strong quarterly profits.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 9.49, to 643.56. The American Stock Exchange index was up 11.64, to 551.63.

HEADLINE: U.S. Presses Effort to Remove Indicted Bosnian Serb Leader

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Friday, July 19

 BODY:
Negotiations here that the Clinton Administration hopes will succeed in ousting Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb political leader, and thus pave the way for smooth elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina dragged on inconclusively into the early hours of thise morning.
At midnight Richard C. Holbrooke, the special United States envoy to the Balkans, who has shuttled to Belgrade, Sarajevo and Zagreb in the last few days, was uncharacteristically silent, saying through a spokesman that he would have no statement overnight. 
 About an hour later, an American official said that the talks were at a critical stage but that Mr. Holbrooke had nothing to report at the moment and hoped for a breakthrough by morning.
The outcome of the talks is regarded by the Administration as vital to the credibility of approaching national elections in Bosnia and to the continuation of the Dayton peace accords.
Mr. Holbrooke is threatening the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, with another round of economic sanctions if he does not arrange for Dr. Karadzic's departure, Western diplomats said.
After an initial round on Wednesday, Mr. Holbrooke returned to Belgrade late Thursday to press Mr. Milosevic for, at the very least, the removal of Dr. Karadzic as chairman of the most powerful political party in Bosnia. He was also demanding, diplomats said, that Dr. Karadzic be forced to leave Bosnia.
Dr. Karadzic, along with the military leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Gen. Ratko Mladic, has been indicted by the international tribunal in The Hague on war crimes charges and is subject to arrest.
Under the Dayton peace agreement, which Mr. Holbrooke orchestrated last year, indicted war criminal are banned from holding public office.
Before coming to Belgrade from Sarajevo, Mr. Holbrooke said that if Dr. Karadzic retained his party post, the Serb Democratic Party, known as the S.D.S., would be banned from taking part.
"If Karadzic is not out of the leadership of the S.D.S., the S.D.S. is decertified," he said.
"If it is decertified, the election will go forward. It will be on the one hand a little more difficult to implement but on the other hand a cleaner election because an organization headed by an indicted war criminal is not running."
The start of campaigning was delayed by Western officials to allow time for Dr. Karadzic to be maneuvered out of the way.
But if Dr. Karadzic's party is kept out of the election, the legitimacy of the result will also be diminished in the eyes of the Serbs because the party is the most popular Bosnian Serb political group.
In the last two months, according to Slobodan Reljic, an editor of Nin magazine in Belgrade, support for Dr. Karadzic's nationalist party has increased from about 50 percent to more than 80 percent.
Mr. Reljic said that if Dr. Karadzic's party were prevented from taking part in the elections, the vote would be considered a farce by most Bosnian Serbs.
The talks today with Mr. Milosevic, held in his suburban residence, appeared to take a serious turn with the arrival of two of the Serbian President's key associates: the head of state security, Jovica Stanisic, and the vice president of the Serbian Socialist Party, Nikola Sainovic.
Mr. Stanisic, who is believed to control the Bosnian Serb elite special forces, has been a mediator in the past when Mr. Milosevic has been under pressure from the West regarding the Bosnian Serbs.
The Serbian security chief talked to Dr. Karadzic in Pale, the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters, on Wednesday, and according to Belgrade press reports, returned to Pale alone on Thursday evening. The reported return of Mr. Stanisic to talk to Dr. Karadzic again left the impression that he had the task of persuading Dr. Karadzic to step aside.
Also present at Mr. Milosevic's villa during the talks was a close colleague of Dr. Karadzic, Momcilo Krajisnik, the president of the Bosnian Serbs' parliament.
It appeared unlikely that Mr. Holbrooke would achieve his ultimate objective: removing Dr. Karadzic from Bosnia. By leaving Bosnia, Dr. Karadzic would become vulnerable to arrest under the international warrant issued this month by the Hague tribunal.
Western diplomats said this was an ideal solution for the West, but it was definitely not in Mr. Milosevic's best interests.
"He would sing like a bird," said a Western diplomat, referring to the likelihood of Dr. Karadzic building a defense by arguing that Mr. Milosevic was ultimately responsible for the war crimes.
As part of his talks, Mr. Holbrooke met with the Croatian President, Franjo Tudjman, in Zagreb on Wednesday night and, according to a Western diplomat, won from him a pledge that he would support reimposing sanctions against Serbia.
Dislodging Dr. Karadzic carries some potential risks for the NATO-led forces and United Nations police based in the Serbian part of Bosnia. In the third threat of its kind in the last week, the mayor of Uglijevik warned on Thursday that foreign soldiers and police would be captured, held hostage and killed if Dr. Karadzic were removed.

AT&T Earnings Rise 10%, But Rivals Perform Better
AT&T, whose dominance in long-distance phone service is being chipped away, said its second-quarter earnings rose 10 percent, failing to perform as strongly as either of its two chief rivals or as well as several regional Bells.

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Mets in Shuffle for Wild-Card Spot

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
To use Joe McIlvaine's term, the Montreal Expos arrived at Shea Stadium last night in their second "bad and ugly" period of the season. The earlier period, in the latter half of May, sent the Expos plummeting out of the National League East lead; the current period has brought them back to the rest of the field in the N.L.'s fourth division.
The fourth division, which forms unofficially whenever anyone wants to start following the playoff prospects of teams distant from first place, is the wild-card division. Each league has one. 
 It is too early, of course, to start determining which teams are going to be the wild cards in this year's playoffs. On this date last season, the Houston Astros and the Texas Rangers had the best won-lost records among teams not in first place. Results of the 1995 playoffs do not mention those teams.
The Yankees, on the other hand, were playing so poorly that they were worse off in the wild-card standings (eighth, eight games behind the Rangers) than they were in the division standings (fourth, seven and a half games behind Boston). Yet the Yankees wound up as the American League's first wild-card team. The N.L. honor went to Colorado, which on this date held a five-game lead in the N.L. West, meaning it followed the reverse route of the Yankees to wild-card status.
Did anyone suspect, after the stumbling start they had, that the Mets could even think of the words "wild card" this season? Yet as they began a four-game series with Montreal, they were four and a half games behind the wild-card-leading Expos, and only three other teams -- Colorado, Los Angeles and Houston -- stood ahead of them.
The Chicago White Sox lead the A.L. wild-card division, followed by Seattle and Baltimore. Milwaukee and Oakland, both playing unexpectedly well, are next, half a game closer than the Yankees were a year ago.
The Mets stumbled in the series opener with Montreal, losing, 7-3, and slipping five and a half games behind the Expos. But that margin would not be impossible to surmount if they are as scrappy as their recent play indicates.
"We've felt all along we were a candidate to be involved in it," McIlvaine, the Mets' general manager, said. "People can say what they want, but I do think we're going to have a good second half. Whether that translates into it depends on how the rest of the teams do, whether anyone catches fire. I think we'll contend for it."
The Mets began the series only two games under .500 (46-48), the first time they were that close to the break-even level since May 4, when they had a 13-15 record.
"I think people lose perspective," McIlvaine said. "One-hundred-sixty-two games is a lot of games. You're going to have good, bad and ugly periods. You can't isolate yourself to one period. It's the totality of it. In the first half, we had a lot of bads and uglies. We had some goods, but we got rid of a lot of our bads and uglies."
Whither the Mets now in their Clint Eastwood season?
In the first half, McIlvaine said, the Mets were "a young club figuring out whether they're good enough to play in this league; now they're going ahead confidently."
The Expos are a young club, too. They spent the first seven weeks in first place, but 11 losses in a 13-game span plunged them from two and a half games ahead to five games behind the Braves. Now another skid, 9 losses in the 11 games before last night's victory, has tripled their deficit, from 3 games to 9.
This more recent "bad and ugly" period should prompt the Expos to check their rear-view mirror even more closely than the road ahead. And all of a sudden, the Mets loom potentially large in that mirror ("Objects in mirror are closer than they appear.")
"What are they, four, four and a half behind us?" Jim Beattie, the Expos' general manager, asked. "We have a four-game series with them so in their minds and for us too, it's a big series."
Big decisions are coming, too. With July 31 the deadline for trades without waivers, teams must decide if they are in the wild-card race or not. If they are, they will hold onto players they otherwise might consider trading to contenders, players with high salaries or pending free agency. If teams decide they realistically don't have a chance even for the wild-card spots, they will pursue trade possibilities.
When the owners shattered tradition and adopted the wild-card concept, they did it for economic reasons. Keep more teams in contention for post-season play, keep fans' interest in the waning weeks of the season and attract more people to the parks.
Although attendance was down consistently last season compared with 1993 -- the last previous season with no labor-dispute curtailment -- it was down less in September than in any other month. After decreases in the 20 percent range in each of the previous three months, attendance was off 15 percent in September. For the owners and players, then, it's never too early to start watching the wild cards.

HEADLINE: HOUSE APPROVES SHIFT ON WELFARE

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 18

 BODY:
The House today approved a bill that would reverse decades of social welfare policy, ending the Federal guarantee of cash assistance for poor children and instead giving states vast new authority to run their own welfare and work programs with lumps sums of Federal money.
The bill, which is very similar to one taken up today in the Senate, would make the biggest changes in welfare policy since the New Deal. 
 The Republican bill was approved 256 to 170, with members largely divided along party lines. A bipartisan alternative, championed today by Democrats and supported by President Clinton, was rejected, 258 to 168.
But even the bipartisan measure would have eliminated the welfare guarantee, or "entitlement," a sign of how far the welfare debate has shifted to the right since Republicans won control of Congress in 1994.
Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said that the bill passed today by the House was better than welfare legislation vetoed by Mr. Clinton in December and January.
"This bill is some improvement," Mr. McCurry said tonight. "It still is way short of what we need in order to be satisfied."
Mr. McCurry said he hoped the Senate would further improve the bill so Mr. Clinton could sign it. "The President remains optimistic that when it comes to welfare reform we're talking signature, not veto," he said.
House Republicans had revised their bill to address some of the President's concerns, but at the same time, they toughened the bill in other ways that make it less palatable to the President.
The bill would set a five-year limit on payment of welfare benefits to any family, and states could set shorter time limits. Adults on welfare would be required to work within two years, or else they would lose their benefits, a policy the President has endorsed.
The Democratic proposal rejected today would have allowed states to use Federal money for vouchers to provide goods and services to children after welfare was cut off. The alternative version would have saved somewhat less money than the Republican bill.
The Republican bill would save $60 billion over the next six years, while the bipartisan alternative would have saved $53 billion.
How to overhaul welfare has been a central issue in the Presidential campaign, and today's debate was full of election-year politics.
Republicans echoed Bob Dole's criticism of President Clinton as a duplicitous politician who vetoed two earlier welfare bills after promising in 1992 to "end welfare as we know it." For their part, Democrats denounced the Republican bill as an assault on poor people, legal immigrants and others with few resources to fight back. But overall the tone of the debate was softer today than last year, when one House Republican compared welfare recipients to alligators and another likened them to wolves.
The Senate is expected to pass its version of the welfare bill in the next few days. The White House has made no veto threats.
Mr. McCurry, said: "In recent days, we're not talking about veto, we're talking about signing. We're talking about finding ways to find things we can sign." But Mr. McCurry left plenty of wiggle room, saying, "The President cannot accept the unacceptable."
Republicans said they would win either way.
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican leader, said: "In the end, the President is going to have to make a determination whether or not he's going to sign this bill and satisfy the American people while he alienates his left-wing political base, or if he's going to veto the bill in order to satisfy the left wing of the Democrat Party, and thereby alienate the American people. That's the choice."
Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, said, "It may be good politics, but it's bad for the children of our nation."
Campaigning today in Milwaukee, Mr. Dole said: "With today's action, it appears that President Clinton will have one last chance to keep his promise on welfare reform. I urge him to heed the counsel of leaders of both parties in Congress who have helped pass the legislation and sign it when it reaches his desk."
Nearly nine million children subsist on the monthly cash benefits they receive from the program known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children. Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, said the Republicans were endangering these children so they could put the President in a political box.
"That's what this bill is all about: politics to hurt America's children," Mr. Matsui said.
In the final House vote on the welfare bill today, 226 Republicans and only 30 Democrats supported the legislation. Four Republicans joined 165 Democrats and 1 independent in voting against the bill.
The measure approved today was more moderate than the welfare bill passed in March 1995, when House Republicans were at the height of their power. The vote then was 234 to 199. Only nine Democrats voted for that bill.
Today, only nine Republicans voted for the bipartisan alternative, devised by Representatives John Tanner, Democrat of Tennessee, and Michael N. Castle, Republican of Delaware.
Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, predicted that President Clinton would sign the bill, despite protests by liberal Democrats and many charitable and religious groups.
"The third time is always a charm," Mr. Kasich said. "The President has vetoed the bill twice. This is the third opportunity he'll have to sign it. I have a suspicion that he will sign it."
Mr. Kasich said the day's most significant development was that Democrats had themselves proposed ending welfare's status as an open-ended entitlement program, which automatically expands when the number of eligible families increases.
Republicans, he said, have caused a profound change in the nation's political landscape, even though they have not achieved all their legislative goals.
"You don't think for a second, do you, that if the Republicans had not taken control of the House of Representatives, we would have this kind of activity today?" Mr. Kasich asked. "Do you really think we would be ending welfare as an entitlement, establishing work requirements and sending power, money and influence back to the states?"
After the bill reached the House floor today, lawmakers toughened it by establishing strict new work requirements for people seeking food stamps. Able-bodied adults with no dependents could receive food stamps for no more than three months unless they were working at least 20 hours a week.
Democrats said that, under this provision, a person laid off after 10 continuous years of work would be ineligible for food stamps if he had received such benefits for three months in a prior recession.
Representative W. G. (Bill) Hefner, a North Carolina Democrat who has been in Congress for 22 years, said: "This is the most mean-spirited amendment I have ever seen on any bill. It's degrading."
But Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, spoke for most of his party when he said: "We have lost the war on poverty. With today's vote, we recognize that the Great Society's welfare programs have not helped people. They have destroyed people."
Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California, said that legal immigrants were an easy target because "they can't vote and they can't hurt the people who attack them."
Representative Martin Frost, Democrat of Texas, said "the Republican welfare bill will push over one million children into poverty."
But Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, complained that the White House had ignored requests for an official estimate of the number of children who would be impoverished. Administration officials said the White House was reluctant to produce such estimates because the President might eventually want to sign the bill and the poverty data would provide ammunition to liberal Democrats arguing that he should veto it.
Mr. McCurry, the White House press secretary, said "the overall intangible values associated with welfare reform," including its emphasis on work, might partly offset the loss of income for people removed from the welfare rolls. But Mr. Moynihan said this was a fallacious argument because many people who would be impoverished by the loss of welfare were already working at low-wage jobs.
Representative Marge Roukema of New Jersey, one of the four Republicans who voted against the bill, said, "No children will go hungry and homeless on my watch if I can help it."
Solid Democratic opposition to the bill presumably makes a veto more likely. Representative Major R. Owens, Democrat of Brooklyn, spoke for most Democrats when he said: "Welfare reform is very much in order. But reform should not be driven by manufactured hysteria and scapegoating. It should not become the oppression and persecution of the poor."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "POINT BY POINT: Welfare Changes"
Following are the major provisions of the House Republican welfare bill. The Senate bill is similar.
 
* The Federal guarantee of cash assistance for poor children would end. Each state would get a lump sum of Federal money to run its own welfare and work programs.
 * The head of every family on welfare would be required to work within two years or the family would lose benefits.
 * Lifetime welfare benefits would be limited to five years. (States may set stricter time limits.) Twenty percent of families may be exempted because of hardship.
 * States could stop payments to unmarried teen-age parents. Payments may be made only if a mother under 18 stays in school and lives with an adult.
 * Federal policy would bar an increase in benefits to cover children born to women already on welfare. States could override this restriction.
 * States that reduce births to unmarried women would be rewarded with additional cash grants.
 * More than 700,000 of the 25.6 million people who now receive food stamps would be cut from the rolls because of new work requirements that apply to able-bodied adults 18 to 50 years old with no dependents.
 * Some states could receive their food stamp money as a block grant. They could then set their own eligibility and benefit levels.
 * About 300,000 disabled children from low-income families would lose cash benefits because of stricter eligibility standards in the Supplemental Security Income program.
 * Future legal immigrants would be ineligible for most Federal welfare benefits and social services during their first five years in the United States. Supplemental Security Income and food stamps would end for noncitizens now receiving benefits, and states could also cut off cash welfare for them.
 * About 500,000 legal immigrants who are not citizens would be cut from the Supplemental Security Income program. At least one million legal immigrants would lose eligibility for food stamps.

For the sixth year in a row, New Jersey's bonds have received an AA+ rating, the second-highest, from the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The state is a good risk because of its "demonstrated ability to balance its financial operations and maintain adequate balances in an environment of slowed economic growth," Standard & Poor's said Wednesday. Moody's Investors Service also gives New Jersey's bonds its second-highest rating, Aa1.

Greenspan's Testimony Spurs a Rally

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices rallied yesterday after the market interpreted comments from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to mean that an increase in interest rates was not imminent.
Mr. Greenspan, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, warned that the central bank might have to raise rates to insure that the economy slows down to prevent inflation from accelerating. Yet he also said he expected that the economy would indeed moderate, and it was that view that market participants chose to focus on in trading yesterday. 
 "Greenspan can't be unhappy with the way the market reacted," said James Glassman, a senior economist at Chase Securities in New York. "The bond market's saying, 'We have a lot of confidence in you.' "
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 16/32 , to 8816/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell below the psychologically important level of 7 percent, to 6.92 percent, from 7.02 percent on Wednesday. The gains came as the Treasury auctioned $48.6 billion of new one-year bills. Rates on the bills fell to their lowest level in nearly two months.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks fostered optimism that inflation would stay low, and that if it did not, the Fed was prepared to take firm action to squelch it.
"He certainly tried to make the point that there's been no resurgence of inflation," said Steven Vielhaber, who oversees more than $20 billion of bonds at Bank of America in Los Angeles. "And though he said he's not seeing a problem there, he's also keeping an eye on the numbers."
Bond yields may not rise much as long as investors believe there's little need for the Fed to raise rates to combat inflation.
The inflation rate has remained below 3 percent for the last four years even as the economy expanded. Consumer prices rose 2.8 percent in the year ended in June, compared with last year's 2.5 percent rate, the lowest since 1986.
Faster growth this year had led some traders to conclude the Fed would have to raise rates to head off inflation.
Yesterday Mr. Greenspan suggested that "maybe he can tolerate above-the-speed-limit growth for some period of time, provided inflation is quiescent," said Ian MacKinnon, who oversees $78 billion at Vanguard Group, the nation's second-biggest mutual fund company, which is based in Valley Forge, Pa. "That's a change," he added.
Even so, many investors say bond yields can fall further so long as traders are convinced the Fed is prepared to raise rates if the need arises.
"The bond market likes it when the Fed is very concerned about inflation and going to be on top of it," Harvey Hirschhorn, a money manager at Stein, Roe & Farnham, a Chicago-based firm with $17 billion in bonds, said.
In the corporate bond market, Associates Corporation of North America, one of the most frequent borrowers in the corporate bond market, took advantage of yesterday's rally to sell $350 million of new bonds.
Associates, a unit of the Ford Motor Company, sold five-year notes that pay interest of 6.75 percent at a discount to yield 6.855 percent, or 35 basis points more than the Treasuries with comparable maturities. A basis point is one-hundredth of 1 percent.
In the municipal market, state and local issuers sold about $1.25 billion in new securities, led by large offerings by New York City's water agency and Nevada's Clark County school district.
New York's water agency had to raise yields on the $580 million in revenue to help attract buyers. About half of the $335 million of the competitively sold Clark County bonds remained in underwriters' hands at the end of the day.
Lehman Brothers Inc. priced the securities as term bonds maturing in 2020 and 2026 to yield as much as 6.33 percent. For an investor in the 36 percent Federal tax bracket, the bonds offer equivalent yields of 9.89 percent. Yields on the securities were raised 2 basis points from their original offering levels.
The District of Columbia returned to the municipal market with a $220 million sale of 75-day notes.
"There is still a little supply out there holding the market back," said Paul Hylle, who manages about $1.6 billion in bonds for the American Express Financial Corporation in Minneapolis.

Judith Connelly Delouvrier
Philanthropist
Judith Connelly Delouvrier, a philanthropist who was a trustee of her family's Philadelphia-based Connelly Foundation, died on Wednesday in the crash of a Trans World Airlines jetliner off Long Island. She was in her 40's and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. 
 A sister, Josephine Mandeville, said that Mrs. Delouvrier had taken the Paris-bound flight to rejoin her two children, Henry, 9, and Isabelle, 7, who were visiting French relatives near Fontainebleau, which is outside Paris.
Mrs. Delouvrier had flown back to New York for four days to monitor renovation work being done on her Manhattan house.
As a trustee of the Connelly Foundation, which was founded in 1955, Mrs. Delouvrier played a substantial role in decision-making about its grants, which are in the fields of education, human services, social services and the arts, mostly in the Philadelphia area.
For some years until 1980, Mrs. DeLouvrier, who had a master's degree in fine arts, was employed at Sotheby's in New York as an assistant to David Nash, who was the head of the Impressionist art department. She was also employed for a time at Revlon, in public relations, especially for the Marcella Borghese line of beauty products.
Her volunteer work over the years included serving on the board of directors of Common Sense, a program to encourage philanthropical leanings in children; serving on the advisory committee of an exchange program for French and American students; assisting with fund raising for the Union Settlement Association, an East Harlem social-service organization, and founding a program called Art Tours for Children. She also was a docent at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Mrs. Delouvrier was born in Jenkintown, Pa. Her father was John F. Connelly, who founded Connelly Container Corporation and became chairman of Crown Cork and Seal Company. He died in 1990.
After attending Melrose Academy in Elkins Park, Pa., Mrs. Delouvrier graduated from Rosemont College in Rosemont, Pa. She did graduate work at the Sorbonne in Paris and received her master's degree from George Washington University.
In 1984, she married Philippe Delouvrier, the son of Paul Delouvrier, a French economist who held administrative posts in Algeria and Paris under President Charles de Gaulle.
In addition to her husband, who is president of Eastern Industrial Minerals in Brunswick, Ga., her children and sister, Mrs. Mandeville of Villanova, Pa., Mrs. Delouvrier is survived by her mother, Josephine O'Neill Connelly of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; two other sisters, Emily Riley, also of Villanova, and Christine Connelly of Columbus, N.J., and two brothers, John and Thomas Connelly, both of Philadelphia.

HEADLINE: From Italy, a Model T for the 90's;
Fiat Joins Race to Build a Car With Worldwide Appeal

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: TURIN, Italy

 BODY:
When Fiat, with Latin frenzy, brought out its "world car" in Brazil in April, the big Italian auto maker called it the Palio, after the breakneck horse race that the Tuscan city of Siena has staged in its cobbled lanes since the Middle Ages.
It is an aptly named effort because the goal of designing a car that can be built and sold in pretty much the same form worldwide is fast becoming something of a steeplechase on wheels. And for Fiat, which has had trouble reaching out beyond Europe, the Palio represents its most ambitious marketing attempt to compete with its Japanese and American rivals. 
 It is also expensive and risky for Fiat, which has been driven to globalization by lackluster European markets. "The industry has gone planetary," said Roberto Testore, the 43-year-old engineer who recently became chief executive of Fiat's auto operations.
The reasons for this global push are clear. While the market for cars is growing slowly in industrialized regions like the United States and Western Europe, strong economic expansion in Latin America and East Asia is spawning armies of car buyers. By the year 2000, car sales outside the United States, Europe and Japan are expected to reach 20 million, about a third of the world total, against 16 percent today.
"There'll be 2 to 3 percent growth in the developed countries, but 7 to 10 percent growth rates in emerging markets," said Philippe Schwarz, director of research at DRI/McGraw Hill in London.
But the danger in trying for a one-size-fits-all car -- as some car makers have discovered -- is that different markets demand different cars. When incomes are low, cars must be cheap; when roads are bad, car design must adapt. And a trendy design in one culture might look either silly or clunky somewhere else.
There is also a danger that cars like the Palio, designed as world cars, will be shunned by prospective buyers who see them as third world cars.
"The world car is a mirage," said Daniel T. Jones, a professor of auto industry management at the Cardiff University business school in Wales.
Still, Fiat is making the leap, spending $2.65 billion to introduce the Palio. And it is far from alone. For decades Europe's auto makers have scrambled for bigger chunks of their congested market. But with the high cost of developing attractive new models translating into only modest gains, they are setting their sights abroad.
France's Peugeot, which sells only 12 percent of its cars outside Europe, wants to lift that to 25 percent by the end of the decade. In Germany, Volkswagen's new Golf, due out in 1998, will be designed around a platform adaptable for markets around the world. And Daimler-Benz, after building in Alabama its first full-scale car plant outside Germany, recently announced plans for a $460 million plant in Brazil to make a new small Mercedes.
America's car makers, meanwhile, are increasingly using Europe as a global launching pad. The Ford Motor Company, which in 1993 rolled out its latest attempt at a world car -- in Europe it's the Mondeo; in the United States it's the Ford Contour or Mercury Mystique -- has begun a program called Ford 2000 to develop similar models into global vehicles.
General Motors entrusted its European unit, grouped around its German Opel subsidiary, with leading its global production strategy. The little Corsa, introduced by Opel in the 1980's, has already asserted itself as a global car, selling in 70 countries. In some places it is called simply the Corsa, in Brazil it is the Chevrolet Corsa, and in Mexico it is sold simply under the name Chevy. Within 10 years, G.M. wants to sell half its cars outside the United States, up from about a third today, said Louis R. Hughes, president of G.M.'s international operations.
Europeans have been no slouches in going global in the past. The fabled Volkswagen Beetle, for example, was a world car of sorts a generation ago. Fiat has been making and selling cars in Brazil for more than 20 years, and for decades has taken cars like the boxy Fiat 124 and assembled them in underdeveloped areas like the old Soviet Union, where the 124 was called the Zhiguli. (Fiat sold cars in the United States with mixed success until it quit the market in 1984.)
A lot has changed since then. For one, the Japanese are successfully building cars in the United States and exporting them in growing numbers to other markets. Thus, European car makers like Fiat are increasingly being forced to respond first to defend their home turf and second to design cars with an eye to the needs of distant markets. And while they may once have thought only in terms of export strategies, they now see themselves being transformed into global production networks as a way to avoid costly duplication.
Indeed, Mr. Testore likes to compare the global operation Fiat is creating to a "virtual factory, with its seat in Turin," Fiat's headquarters.
Detroit has taken two basic approaches. When Ford introduced the Mondeo in 1993, the idea was to produce a car for all its markets worldwide. Though consumer surveys showed that its lines had to be made sleeker for American tastes, the car was essentially the same whether it came off Ford assembly lines in Genk, Belgium, or in Kansas City, Mo.
Still, the effort turned out to be extraordinarily expensive -- $6 billion -- and it has not been uniformly popular. While Genk has turned out 1.3 million cars, Kansas City has built only 500,000.
G.M., on the other hand,has made Opel its base camp for Europe, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, as a way to to separate the American market from the rest of the world. And rather than try for a true world car, G.M. reduced the number of basic platforms, then varied the versions it builds on them.
Under the Ford 2000 program, basically an organizational revamping, Ford is establishing centers dedicated solely to developing certain kinds of vehicles that Ford will sell worldwide. Its new center in Europe, for example, will develop Ford's small front-wheel-drive cars for sale not just in Europe and Asia but in America, too.
As for Chrysler, it lacks the global clout and strong overseas subsidiaries of its Detroit rivals, and its approach so far has been to take models that have sold well at home, like its mini-vans, and rejigger them for foreign markets.
Fiat chose a different path.
Instead of varying existing models for emerging markets, Fiat earmarked $2.65 billion to develop a fresh line of cars. The result is a basic model that can be varied as hatchback or sedan, pickup, station wagon or mini-van. The basic, no-frills Palio has a one-liter engine that Fiat hopes to be able to sell virtually anywhere for $8,000 to $9,000, but the car can be dressed up to meet more sophisticated tastes. Though it is clearly designed for markets outside Europe and the United States, Mr. Testore does not rule out selling some versions, like the pickup, in Europe in two to three years.
To cope with bad roads, the Palio was built higher and with a tougher suspension than European Fiats, and this in turn meant interiors had to be designed differently.
But Fiat also set out to design an entire production system in which components and vehicles could go back and forth among various markets. This, it hopes, will help overcome customs barriers and create revenue flows to ease exchange-rate worries.
Building on an already strong Latin American base, Fiat sank $1.6 billion into assembly plants in Brazil and Argentina. In the next few years, Palio production will be added in Turkey, Poland, Morocco, India and South Africa. In China and Vietnam, Fiat is negotiating manufacturing rights. By the year 2000, Mr. Testore estimates, Fiat will be adding roughly a million Palios a year to the 2.5 million other cars it now produces.
To assure high local content, Fiat has lured suppliers to the Latin American production sites. By exchanging components between the factories in Brazil and Argentina, Fiat hopes to gain exemptions from high tariffs.
What Fiat is saying, said Karl E. Ludvigsen, a former Ford executive who is now a consultant in London, is, "We have enough volume out there that we can afford to design and engineer for those markets."
"This might mean the Palio has a longer life cycle," he said. "In my view, it's a quite ingenious approach."
But other European car makers, including units of Ford and G.M., are not convinced.
G.M. executives in Europe have made clear their preference for a variable system of platforms. Peter H. Hanenberger, executive vice president of international operations, says that by mixing and matching components, "we can develop 10 or more vehicle variations, which are completely different in design, purpose and character."
Whichever approach prevails, experts say further risks lurk as virtually all car makers rush into the same markets.
Still, no one dares not join the race.
Alexander J. Trotman, Ford's chairman, recently told a gathering of European auto executives that some experts were calling the "intense, fast-paced, high-stakes battle that will result from these new market conditions hypercompetition."
"I call it a real dogfight," he said.
