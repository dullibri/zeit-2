Tease 'Em, Scare 'Em, Snare 'Em

BYLINE:  By A. O. SCOTT 

 BODY:
WHEN I was younger, and moviegoing was an addiction rather than a job, nothing would annoy me more than arriving at the theater too late to see the trailers, unless perhaps it was settling in to watch a movie that, for reasons of length or gravity, was not accompanied by trailers at all. To miss the previews of coming attractions was, in my mind, to lose some of the pleasure to which I was entitled by the price of the ticket. Sitting in before-the-feature semi-darkness, trying to refrain from eating all your popcorn before the end of the opening credits, watching for the Motion Picture Association of America's reassurance that, whatever restrictions have been placed on the film itself, the following preview has been approved for all audiences -- these moments of foreplay are also, somehow, the very quintessence of movie love. 
 Previews, that is, embody the great promise of modern consumerist entertainment: that there will always be more. They are like the still-wrapped packages under a Christmas tree: the one you are about to tear into might turn out to be a pair of wool socks or a cheap knockoff of the toy you really wanted, but there is still all this other stuff yet to be opened up. "Daredevil" (let's say) may be a lame and logy attempt to tether a semi-bankable star to a beloved comic book, bogged down by an incoherent story and sodden special effects, but at least the disappointment can be offset by the anticipation of future comic-book adaptations -- maybe "X-Men 2" or "The Hulk" or "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" or "Bulletproof Monk." 
 Whatever disappointments the movies themselves might bring are safely in the future, as you feel the rush of all their expensive promise -- the fights, the explosions, the computer-generated imagery, the macho repartee -- in compact, thrill-packed doses. Big, commercial movies may rarely be surprising these days, but the possibility that they might be is always there.
Preview watching, and the commitment-free triage it inspires -- hey, that looks cool; man, that looks terrible; what the heck was that supposed to be? -- is an integral part of moviegoing, and a commercially vital aspect of the movie industry. (Previews even have their own awards, the Golden Trailers. This year's were given out last Friday.) But it is also one of those aspects of the moviegoing experience that separate critics from the rest of the audience. In the screening rooms where I and my bedraggled ilk watch movies, day in and day out, there is no popcorn and there are no trailers, lest our anticipation of things to come distract us from our reasoned evaluation of what is before us here and now.
We can still see the trailers, of course: videotapes of them arrive in the mail daily, and, like everyone else with the proper downloads and plug-ins, we can watch them online (and it won't even count as goofing off). But our relationship to previews is defined not just by the fact that we don't need them: we have press releases, editors and deadlines to keep us abreast of the coming attractions. The indifference is mutual: trailers don't need us, and are indeed designed to pre-empt and counteract our influence.
The movie economy is, more than ever, organized around opening-weekend grosses, with the partial exception of the holiday season, when a crowd of awards contenders is thinned out through a Darwinian releasing schedule. But while the awards are harvested between December and March, the real money is made in the summertime, which begins sometime in mid-February and lasts for six months. The blockbuster audience must thus be teased into a state of, if not enthusiasm, then at least curiosity, or at the very least susceptibility to peer pressure, sufficient to get them to the theaters on that first weekend. And trailers, a form of advertising actively sought out by its targets, are a crucial form of bait.
Like other modes of advertisement, the preview is a subtle and demanding art form in its own right, and it is, moreover, a kind of advertising made out of the very product it sells (and often made before the product itself has been finished). How, without actually showing someone a movie, can you make that person want to go and see the movie? There are obvious crutches, like proclaiming that a given picture comes from the director or the producer of some previous hit, or giving ample play to the stars the audience can't get enough of, or making one sequel after another.
Pairing Jack Nicholson and Adam Sandler in a comedy called "Anger Management" is probably enough to pique the curiosity of every self-styled bad boy between the ages of 12 and 70, and the sloppiness of the trailer I saw -- stitched together of enough kind-of-funny scenes to establish the unlikely premise that Mr. Nicholson is playing Mr. Sandler's court-assigned therapist -- demonstrates that the concept has been allowed to sell itself.
Similarly, I found myself walking backward up the down escalator in a Midtown Manhattan multiplex recently, because a monitor perched above me was playing a preview for "Head of State," the new Chris Rock comedy, and I was waiting to see Mr. Rock and Bernie Mac, two of the most brilliant comedians at work today, do something funny. I was also looking for evidence, as yet unforthcoming, that either man can actually act. 
Franchises and stars help, of course, but the goal of the trailer is to convey two things in just the right quantity: information and sensation. The former is a more volatile commodity; it is possible, in the space of two and a half minutes, both to bore the audience and to spoil their anticipation of the movie in question. For example, the trailers for "The Life of David Gale," with Kevin Spacey, managed both to convey the utter ludicrousness of the film's premise -- a philosophy professor and anti-death-penalty activist facing execution as a journalist fights to save him and a flock of birds takes suddenly to the sky -- and to signal the ridiculous surprise plot twist.
Happily, this may have kept people away from the movie -- a preview of coming repulsions, you might say. Conversely, though, there is "Dreamcatcher," the preview for which, by showing a quick shuffle of enigmatic, spooky images -- Damian Lewis looking terrified and then sinister, something scratching on a battered wooden door, a herd of animals fleeing through the snow -- scared me silly. Silly, however, is what the movie turned out to be, once it betrayed the preview's elegant sleight of hand and showed the thing on the other side of the door to be a snarling extraterrestrial worm, part of a race of mucusoid invaders. 
The "Dreamcatcher" trailer, though, is successful in suggesting something of the movie's plot (wisely not too much of it) and in giving a taste of its desired effects. "Phone Booth" has a similarly effective trailer, which hits us with scraps of story -- Colin Farrell plays a jerk with woman trouble who picks up a ringing Times Square pay phone and finds himself the plaything of a sociopath with a high-powered rifle who won't let him hang up -- and jolts of suspense. Whether the story holds together or the suspense sustains itself are not relevant here (and I haven't seen the movie). The trailer, in teasing you to wonder if they do, has done its job. 
As, often enough, trailers do, by casting a spell of pulse-racing disorientation. I have no idea what happens in "The Hulk" (from the director, I was reminded, of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"), but after 70 seconds I was a little breathless from all the explosions, fast cuts, and shots of Jennifer Connelly looking perplexed. On the other hand, after the same exposure to "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen," I was just baffled, my mind a free-associative jumble. Martial arts. Sean Connery. Invisible guy. Computer animation. Bad fights for good.
And the epic two-and-a-half-minute preview for "The Core" was like witnessing someone's oral exams in bogus environmental military geophysics, accompanied by the destruction of whole American cities and other explosions. I did note that Aaron Eckhart's pronunciation of "nuclear" follows that of the real-life commander in chief. Was that in the script or did Mr. Eckhart ad-lib?
We may never know, but we will find out soon enough whether he saves the planet from destruction caused by the unintended effects of a high-tech seismic superweapon. I'll go out on a limb and guess that he does, in which case I won't necessarily be disappointed. Especially if I see "The Core" in the theater, with a large bag of popcorn and 10 minutes of trailers before the big show starts.

'Space Coast' City Says No to Growth

BYLINE:  By WALECIA KONRAD 

DATELINE: COCOA BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
WHEN Eric Fricker, 42, went back home to Florida in 1986, he was a political middle-of-the-roader just looking for a place to raise a family. He had grown up on Merritt Island, and he and his wife, Susie, settled in Cocoa Beach, which occupies a spit of land just across the Banana River from his boyhood home. 
 He remembered blocks of affordable oceanfront homes in Cocoa Beach, with rows of cozy bungalows tucked next to canals and a commercial strip of mom and pop two-story hotels, fish joints and surf shops -- all in the shadow of the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, the next town north. (Imagine being a young boy watching Apollo launches from your backyard.) 
 He accepted the seven- and eight-story condominiums that had grown up in his absence as a sign of progress. At least in the residential neighborhoods, he thought, Cocoa Beach still resembled the 1960's town in "I Dream of Jeannie," the sitcom that made it famous. 
The town isn't much different today. But Mr. Fricker is. Worried that big tourist developments could be on the way, spreading from elsewhere on Florida's east coast, he has evolved from registered Republican into a slow-growth advocate who is the state's first elected official from the Green Party. As a city commissioner and vice mayor (sometimes at loggerheads with the slightly more pro-development mayor), he leads an ardent citizens' movement trying to do what may be impossible: keep a prime stretch of sand on Florida's Atlantic Coast as a small middle-class town.
"Our city charter says we're a residential resort community," said Mr. Fricker, an engineer at Lockheed Martin Marietta at Cape Canaveral. "It's that word 'resort' that gets us into trouble." As he spoke, he was sitting at the kitchen table in his airy three-bedroom house on a quiet street in the southern part of town. Across the room, through a wide window, was a view of the canal in his backyard and his rowboat. 
After pushing an anti-growth referendum onto city ballots four times in the last three years (each time, at least 68 percent of voters approved) and having the first three stalled by court challenges, Mr. Fricker and his allies have finally achieved their goal: the growth limits swept in by almost 70 percent of voters last November were not challenged and are now law. They limit commercial buildings to 45 feet in height (about four stories) and hotels and motels to 28 units per acre; both restrictions were written to discourage tourism development. (The earlier limits were 85 feet high and 40 units per acre.) This success has led Mr. Fricker to become a consultant of sorts to other Florida towns wanting to limit tourism.
People in Cocoa Beach summarize what they want to prevent in two words: Fort Lauderdale. Like the weekend towns sprinkled around New York City that proudly call themselves "un-Hamptons," the Cocoa Beach that supported the referendum wants to be the "un-Lauderdale," and people are quick to draw the comparison.
"It's not that we have anything against Fort Lauderdale," said Bill Myers, the chairman of the 10-year-old Citizens Action Committee, which opposes fast growth. "But we don't want towers lining our shores and residents being separated from the beachfront. We want to keep it more of a family residential area as opposed to a tourist mecca."
A stranger driving into Cocoa Beach for the first time might wonder what there is to preserve. Going south on Route A1A, the four-lane coastal highway that runs the six-mile length of Cocoa Beach, you're faced with a long stretch of beachside condos and chain motels. So dense is the commercial strip that if not for the sprawling neon-clad surf shops, you wouldn't know you were just a block away from the ocean.
Only when you reach a residential area or go down one of the many narrow side streets that offer beach access (all beaches in Florida are public) will you glimpse of the Atlantic.
"Cocoa Beach is essentially 95 percent built out," said Mayor Skip Beeler, who was elected last November with the support of several local developers but supports the restrictions on growth. "There are very few empty lots left."
Although critics may characterize Cocoa Beach's commercial development as uninspired and often insensitive, it is still on a relatively small scale. Mr. Fricker and his allies on the Citizens Action Committee want to seize the moment before developers can tear down more old small buildings to put up large new ones.
The new law "just takes things one step further and ensures that Cocoa Beach does not become another Fort Lauderdale," said Janice Scott, a former mayor and Mr. Fricker's political mentor.
Others have more expansive ideas. "I've been here all my life, and like it or not, this is a tourism community," said Roger Dobson, who has ownership interests in several hotels and motels in Cocoa Beach and supports further development.
This is the kind of battle that Florida developers have frequently won. But the un-Lauderdale crowd has an important factor on their side: they may have entered the fray before it's too late, in part because of Cocoa Beach's unique history.
"This city grew in two or three years, when we decided to race the Russians to the moon," said Anthony Caravella, Cocoa Beach's director of development services. Then the Apollo program shut down, hitting Cocoa Beach hard. Later the Challenger shuttle disaster put a pall on the city's growth, and now perhaps the loss of the Columbia will have a similar effect. In a state that has experienced spiraling population growth in the last 20 years, and in a county that has kept pace, Cocoa Beach has had a steady year-round population of about 12,500 in the same period. 
It still has a high concentration of single-family homes, and it is still unknown to many Florida visitors. At the southern end of town, where the land is only a quarter-mile wide in places, there are spots where if not for the modern cars, visitors might think they had wandered into Cuba. Block after block is frozen in time, with small 1950's ranch houses, many of them leaning toward seedy, on tiny plots -- surely one of the most humble oceanfront neighborhoods in the state of Florida.
Even so, the tourist trade has grown, partly because the beach is one of the closest to Orlando. The Cocoa Beach population now swells to almost three times its usual size at the height of the summer and winter tourist seasons, about the same as other small beach towns, Mayor Beeler said. (The city manager says he can tally the number of tourists on any given day using an intricate calculation based on toilet flushes.) 
Owners of prime commercial property are not happy with the success of the referendum. "There's no objective data that shows why 45 feet is a better number than 65 feet or 85 feet," said William Cantwell, a lawyer representing Vacation Beach, a local company owned by Mike Davis, a longtime resident. In 2000, Mr. Davis and his two business partners, who are also his wife and brother-in-law, bought the 50's-era Silver Sands Motel on Atlantic Avenue.
In late 2001, Vacation Beach's plans to develop a seven-story condominium complex on the motel site were approved by the city. When the first referendums passed, it was Vacation Beach, fighting to break ground, that challenged them in court. In January, the City Commission settled the company's lawsuit, allowing the project to go ahead and precluding a Vacation Beach challenge to the last vote.
Mr. Dobson, the hotel owner, makes an economic argument. "The main purpose of these restrictions is to reduce tourism," he said. "It will stop all hotels and condos because these limits take the economics out of any project. You just can't make any money. That means no new tax base in Cocoa Beach. That's too bad because Cocoa Beach needs multifamily taxes to keep residents' taxes down."
He also contends that the restrictions may thwart good planning. "Building up is actually a better way to save green space than building out," he said. He is a part-owner of the eight-story Hampton Inn, which is surrounded by attractive landscaping. But the hotel, built in 1999, looms over the homes on the neighboring street.
The fight in Cocoa Beach has attracted the attention of other Florida towns. Mr. Fricker and other members of the City Commission have received calls from officials, citizens and advocates in Rockledge, West Melbourne and other towns struggling with their own height and density issues.
Mr. Fricker's advice? Hire the best lawyer you can afford. "The rules that govern growth and planning and zoning in the city and county government are incredibly complex," he said. "I don't consider myself a dummy. I have an engineering degree. But the complexity benefits the developers. They have the money and time to go through all the hoops required."
Mr. Fricker's journey to the Green Party wasn't solely by way of his concern about development. After health problems in the early 1990's, he became a vegetarian and then a vegan, avoiding dairy products. Trying to find like-minded individuals -- and some good recipes -- he met people concerned about animal rights and the environment, and began to share their ideas. He started attending City Commission meetings and was soon recruited by Ms. Scott, then the mayor, to run for office. He was elected to the commission in 2000.
His term ends this year, and he does not plan to run for re-election. "I did what I set out to do," he said. Future commissions cannot easily overturn the restrictions, even though many local businessmen oppose them. They are written into the City Charter and cannot be changed without a referendum. 
Developers, too, seem resigned to the new rules and ready to move on, working within them. The one exception is the local hospital, which occupies a tiny island, created by landfill, in the Banana River, a saltwater lagoon. Desperate to expand, the hospital wants to put in more landfill and construct an addition that would be above the 45-foot limit. 
The hospital may get its way, but the un-Lauderdalers have not changed their minds about other issues. "Did you read in the paper how the recent City Hall meeting was devoted to where to put the new boccie courts?" Ms. Fricker asked Ms. Scott recently.
"That's exactly what a place like Cocoa Beach should be worried about," Ms. Scott replied. "Boccie courts."

HEADLINE: Korean Contractors Hope for a Windfall in Postwar Iraq 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, March 19 

 BODY:
South Korea's big construction companies, which have been important builders throughout the Arab world for decades, are hoping that the war in Iraq will produce a bonanza for them in a lucrative market they had to abandon 12 years ago.
 Representatives of the big contractors, led by Hyundai Engineering and Construction, one of the leading builders in Iraq before the 1991 Persian Gulf war, said today that they had been quietly developing plans for weeks to jump back in when the shooting stops and the reconstruction begins. 
 "Certainly we should have an interest in going back," said Cha Song Chun, senior vice president for marketing at Hyundai Construction. "In the past we built a hospital, roads, highways, railways and highways. We will see what we can do." 
South Korea's construction companies, many of them still trying to fully recover from the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and 1998, hope to move quickly to take over jobs that military engineers are likely to have begun in the immediate aftermath of the war.
Indeed, South Korea's contribution to the American-led coalition may include sending an army engineering unit to Iraq to help start the reconstruction, Ra Jong Yil, President Roh Moo Hyun's national security adviser, said today.
Mr. Ra said that American and South Korean officials were talking about possible noncombat roles for Korean troops, including aiding the evacuation of refugees as well as reconstruction, but that nothing had yet been decided. 
Still, the Korean contractors, known for bidding aggressively for work in politically risky places, is aching to get back to Iraq.
"We were the last construction company in Iraq before the gulf war," said Cho Sang Hoon, a deputy general manager at Hyundai Construction. "We still maintain a branch office there."
That office, Mr. Cho said, is a one-executive outpost left behind to watch over millions of dollars worth of construction equipment stranded in the country since 1991. The manager left Baghdad a month ago and is now in Amman, Jordan, waiting for a chance to return.
Other companies are eager as well, and the Seoul government is encouraging them to look to Iraq as a source of new work at a time when business elsewhere is soft. "We have not had any construction in Iraq since before the gulf war," said Kim Heung Jin, deputy director for overseas construction at the construction ministry. "Before that, we had many construction companies in Iraq. They all want to go back. Even if they don't have a detailed plan, they just want to go back."
That includes Daelim Industrial, which built bridges and highways in Iraq before 1990. "If we have an opportunity, we will go back," said Kwon Sung Yong, the company's planning manager. "We are now monitoring the situation." And it also applies to LG Engineering and Construction, which has never built in Iraq before but sees attractive prospects now, perhaps even for work before the shooting is over.
But the company with the most at stake is Hyundai Construction, whose founder, Chung Ju Yung, always viewed it as "the mother company" of a business empire that once sprawled from cars to shipbuilding to semiconductors before it was broken up in the late 1990's. 
Mr. Chung, who died two years ago this month, went into Iraq in 1980, winning contracts to build a $300 million medical complex, a sewage treatment plant and a number of supermarkets. Hyundai crews stayed in the country and kept working through the war with Iran that Iraq started later that year, adding assignments to build apartment blocks on Baghdad's historic Haifa Street, a $400 million power plant south of the capital and an expressway from the border with Jordan to the Syrian border.
A small Hyundai contingent even stuck around through the invasion of Kuwait and counterinvasion by the American-led coalition in 1991. It was not until after American warplanes bombed radar and missile sites in southern Iraq in January 1993 that the company gave up hope of resuming work on its projects in Iraq any time soon, and pulled out almost all its remaining employees.
"They still owe us more than $1 billion," Lee Tae Suk, senior manager of public relations for Hyundai Construction, said of the Iraqi government.
Mr. Lee said his company now had 22 active projects in the Middle East, including a $1.2 billion contract to build parts of the South Pars natural gas pipeline in Iran.
But it badly needs profitable new work, and is looking urgently toward its old stomping ground in Iraq to find it. After heavy losses in 2000 and 2001, the company reported a tiny $22 million net profit last year, and has debt equal to seven times its equity. "We lose a lot of money," Mr. Lee said.

HEADLINE: Egypt Braces for a Serious Blow to Tourism 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 20 

 BODY:
The start of the war against Iraq is a significant economic blow for Egypt because of its dependence on income from tourism, Elhamy el-Zayat, the chairman of the Egyptian Travel Federation, said today.
 "If it is a short war, our direct losses for the coming couple of months would be $2 billion," Mr. 
Zayat said. "And I am not talking about the tourism-feeding industries here, which will suffer even more." 
 Egypt depends on tourism for one-eighth of its economy. The industry suffered badly after the terror attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, when many tourists avoided the Middle East, and it had only begun to rebound when the crisis in Iraq heated up.
"We had hoped that by October, there would be recovery," Mr. Zayat said. "But if the war continues, the longer it lasts, the worse it is for tourism here.
"I am afraid all temporary labor will be laid off."
In a normal year, the country's hotels are about 70 percent full in March, Mr. Zayat said, but right now in Luxor and Aswan, the figure is just 20 percent, and in Cairo and Sharm al Sheik, 40 percent. 
Public opposition to the war, as evidenced in street demonstrations today in Cairo and elsewhere, could also have an economic effect. The Arab Union of Physicians published an advertisement Tuesday in Al Ahram, the widely read semiofficial newspaper, that calls for a boycott of all goods from countries that are participating in the attack on Iraq. 
The government itself announced March 11 that the state and state-owned companies, which play a large role in the economy, would stop importing any goods, other than necessities like food and medicine, for three months to help conserve foreign exchange and relieve pressure on the Egyptian pound.

Effects of War On Neverland
 Broadway's attention, like everyone's, was on the Middle East this week. The question was simple: how does war with Iraq affect an industry where escapism is the currency of the realm? 
 The board of the League of American Theaters and Producers met on Wednesday to brief members on security, and company managers for each production were expected to pass on the information to their casts. 
The reactions seemed muted. Even as commuters face heightened security at river crossings and on city streets, theater owners were mum about what measures were being taken beyond those daunting bag checks. The attitude on Broadway seemed to be to wait and see.
"This is not about us," said Jed Bernstein, president of the league. "We're doing what we do. The lights of Broadway are going to stay lit."
On the business side, however, some producers were fretting that a long war would scare off audiences at the height of the season. Between Thursday, when "Urban Cowboy" opens, and May 7, the Tony deadline, 13 productions are scheduled, not to mention dozens of shows Off and Off Off Broadway. The last time the nation went to war in the Persian Gulf, in January 1991, sales fell sharply after hostilities began, but recovered after two weeks.
Yet many factors are different this time, most prominently the heightened fear of terrorist strikes. It is that anxiety, said several insiders, that is the scariest.
"Nobody is excited about anything," said one industry professional. "The wind is out of the sails in terms of a big spring opening. There is a real apathy because people are distracted by the other things."
The war also comes only a week after the musicians' strike, which shut down Broadway musicals for four days, and resulted in weaker sales for many shows. In addition, the industry's advance sales, which are critical to shows' long-term marketing plans, have never fully recovered from Sept. 11, 2001.
Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, which owns 16 Broadway theaters, said that the strike and the war had depressed daily sales figures. But he held out hope that the industry, which was relatively undaunted by last month's security alerts, would soldier through.
"Sept. 11 caused havoc, but there was a considerable rebound," Mr. Schoenfeld said, sounding cautious. "Now we've hadtwo situations, the strike and the current hostilities overseas."
What everyone agrees on is that a long conflict will hurt an industry that is already dealing with a weak city economy and a decline in tourism.
Nine commercial Broadway shows have closed this year as a result of a tough winter and sluggish sales; yesterday "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" joined the list when its producers announced that it would close on April 6.
Rocco Landesman, president of the Jujamcyn chain, which owns five Broadway theaters, said everybody was banking on a quick solution. "The hope is that the war will be as short as the strike," Mr. Landesman said. "But that may be just wishful thinking."

From TV to Theater
Few entertainers have been more vocal, for better or worse, on United States foreign policy than Bill Maher, the former host of "Politically Incorrect" on ABC who lost that job after he made remarks deemed insensitive after Sept. 11, 2001.
Mr. Maher has staged a comeback in recent weeks with a new HBO show, "Real Time With Bill Maher," and plans to bring his act to New York. Beginning on April 29, Mr. Maher will be at the Virginia Theater on Broadway with "Victory Begins at Home," his one-man riff on all things political.
He toured with the show last fall, when it included a long section about war fears regarding Iraq, a portion that Mr. Maher says will have to be updated. "That was apropos in November," he said this week. "Now it's a moot point."

New at Williamstown
And now for something completely different: theater in a peaceful, bucolic place. The Williamstown Theater Festival, the annual summertime retreat in Williamstown, Mass., has announced its schedule for the 2003 season, including a revival of Brecht's mordant masterpiece, "The Threepenny Opera," which looks all the world like a pre-Broadway tryout. The production will star Jesse L. Martin as Mack the Knife; Betty Buckley as his bitter old flame, Pirate Jenny; and Melissa Errico as Mack's spirited bride, Polly Peacham.
Also on tap at Williamstown are four main-stage revivals: John Guare's "Landscape of the Body," Tom Stoppard's "Travesties," "An Enemy of the People" by Ibsen and "Under Milk Wood" by Dylan Thomas. New plays by A. R. Gurney and Frank D. Gilroy will also be staged.

Along the Way
*The Upright Citizens Brigade, the respected alternative troupe, has found a new home. The company, which runs one of the largest comedy acting training programs in the country and is host to dozens of comedy shows, lost its Manhattan theater on West 22nd Street in November after the city found a zoning violation. Now the company is planning to reopen at a larger space at 307 West 26th Street, formerly the Maverick Theater.
*Jules Feiffer's new play, "A Bad Friend," will feature Larry Bryggman, Mark Feuerstein, Jonathan Hadary, David Harbour, Jan Maxwell and Kala Savage. Jerry Zaks will direct performances beginning May 15 at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater.
*There is also a supporting cast for "Master Harold . . . and the Boys," the Roundabout Theater Company's revival of Athol Fugard's drama, set to star Danny Glover. Michael Boatman (of "Spin City" and "Arliss") and Christopher Denham, a newcomer, round out the cast. Opening night is May 29 at the Booth.
*Graham Norton, the flamboyant British comic whose talk show "So Graham Norton" is a nice mix of snide and sycophantic, will take his act to the East 13th Street Theater, 126 East 13th Street, in the East Village, in late April for two weeks.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 5, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A report in the On Stage and Off column on March 21 about plans to present "The Threepenny Opera" at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts misstated the name of a character. She is Jenny Diver, not Pirate Jenny.

HEADLINE: A Big Threat to Asia's Export-Driven Economies 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, March 20 

 BODY:
Asia did not have to wait for hostilities to start. The region, which was expected to be a major driver of global economic growth this year, has been feeling the ill effects of the crisis in Iraq for months. 
 The run-up in oil prices since last fall has raised the cost of producing goods and getting them to market. The slide in the dollar's value has hurt those goods' competitiveness abroad. And the global climate of uncertainty has eroded demand. 
 The harm is not deep or lasting yet, economists, government officials and business leaders here say, and if the war is over as soon as they expect, the region should quickly rebound. The sharp retreat in oil prices in the last week suggests that the market expects the war to last a few weeks at most. 
But if it drags on for months, big trouble looms for Asia. New peaks in oil prices and a trough in demand in the United States could combine to erase the chances for growth.
"The war could lead to declining exports in Asia," said Dr. Somjai Phagaphasvivat, a professor of political economy at Thammasat University in Bangkok. "And most of Asia is dependent on exports."
Asia should be enjoying a year of robust growth. The region is now the world's biggest factory floor, the global center for manufacturing everything from textiles and toys to sneakers and electronic gadgets like VCR's, cameras, televisions, computers and mobile phones.
Though Japan has flagged in recent years, China's rapidly evolving economy is still roaring ahead, and the old "tiger" economies like Malaysia and Thailand have been posting strong export growth. The International Monetary Fund forecast solid growth for the region as a whole in 2003.
But in an increasingly global marketplace, Asia's export-driven economies depend heavily on continued buying by consumers in the United States and Europe. Any shock to consumer confidence there could seriously harm Asia's exports, economists say. And officials of the monetary fund say the region already faced a slowdown because of the war.
"The U.S. is a locomotive for global growth, so much of what happens here depends on consumer attitudes in the U.S.," said David Cohen, a Singapore-based economist with MMS International, an investment research company. 
Asia's financial markets suggest that investors remain uncertain about growth this year. Though most of Asia's major stock indexes have rallied in recent days, many are still down sharply over the last year, some by more than 30 percent.
One worry is the high cost of energy. Even after retreating nearly $10 a barrel from the peak last week, crude oil prices remain well above the average over the last 10 years. And the high prices have already begun to drive up production and transportation costs in Asia.
Higher oil prices also mean higher costs for other materials, like the oil-based plastics that are one of the modern economy's basic components, used in everything from furniture to electronics to appliances.
Countries like South Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan are strongly affected by rising oil prices because they import much of their oil. China's oil imports are small relative to its economy, but energy costs are soaring there, too, as the country builds more cars and modern highways. 
Some economists in Asia say oil prices could double or triple, to a range of $60 to $80 a barrel, if the war lasts more than a few months, and that would have dire economic consequences.
"Higher fuel costs will increase production costs all over Asia," said Christopher Bruton, a consultant at Dataconsult in Bangkok.
Higher production costs could touch off inflationary pressures in some Asian countries, altering the domestic market for goods and services and raising the price of many exports to the West.
Economists are also watching the global currency markets. The dollar has weakened in recent months against the Japanese yen, the Thai baht and other Asian currencies, a trend that has slightly eased the impact of energy prices, which are set worldwide in dollars. But the weakening dollar makes Asian goods more expensive when they reach their most important market, the United States, which may damp demand for them.
Tourism in Asia is also expected to suffer from the war in Iraq and from renewed fears about terrorism. Travel to the region has already been depressed by last October's terrorist bombing in Bali and by a pneumonia outbreak that has killed nine people and hospitalized hundreds more in China, Vietnam, Singapore and even Canada and Europe in recent weeks.
Now, airlines like JAL in Japan and Thai Airways are bracing for further contraction. 
Tourism officials in Thailand, a leading destination for foreign travel in Asia, say business has already slowed in recent weeks, and may soon grow worse, though there is some hope that growing regional traffic from places like China could provide some cushion.
"We're prepared for the impact of the war," said Walailak Noypayak, director of research and statistics at the Tourism Authority of Thailand. "If it's not a long war, we think tourism could be normal in two or three months. But we do expect decreasing numbers from European countries and the U.S."
Australia is also expecting a weaker tourist season. Qantas Airways said recently that because it expects a 20 percent fall in international travel, it was eliminating about 1,000 jobs.
Economists caution, however, that the nature and severity of the war's economic fallout could vary widely from country to country in the Asia-Pacific region. It is an area, after all, that stretches from India to Japan and accounts for about two-thirds of the world's population.
For example, Malaysia and Indonesia are net oil exporters who benefit from higher oil prices, but could be hurt if nonoil exports dry up because of a weaker global economy. By contrast, Japan, the world's second-largest economy, depends on a lifeline of imported oil, mostly from the Middle East, and could be among the countries most vulnerable to the effects of the war.
"The strikes on Iraq by the U.S. and the U.K. would give a considerable blow to the Japanese economy," said Yoshio Tateisi, president of the Omron Corporation, an automation equipment maker. "Even if the war ends after a short period, it is possible some factors may impede an early economic recovery in Japan, such as terrorist attacks or aid for Iraq's reconstruction." 
India also faces serious problems if the war lasts long, though with 30 to 40 days' supply of oil in reserve, it could ride out a short war. It has less to fear from slumping trade than many other Asian nations because exports account for a small percentage of gross domestic product, but it needs tourism, foreign investment and foreign customers who feel comfortable with its software and business-services industries.
"There may be a perception that India falls within the so-called seismic zone, even though it does not, and that may make foreign investors cautious," said Ajit Ranade, an economist at ABN Amro.
Thailand, which has been enjoying strong export demand for its electronics, seafood and rubber, had been expecting growth of as much as 6 percent this year. But the war has led some economists to trim their projections to 3 or 4 percent, despite the government's efforts to keep gasoline prices here stable.
The hope, economists here say, is that government spending and robust markets for cars and real estate may cushion the blow.
"If this is not a protracted war, I think Thailand will be fine," said Dr. Phagaphasvivat at Thammasat University. "But if the war goes on for months, I think the economy could be seriously hurt."

HEADLINE: Young, Hopeless and Violent in the New South Africa 

BYLINE:  By GINGER THOMPSON 

DATELINE: CAPE TOWN, South Africa, March 19 

 BODY:
Military trucks and armored police vans brought a few hours peace to Kalksteenfontein Elementary School this morning so that a community ravaged by violence could pay tribute to another slain child.
 As soldiers, armed with assault rifles, took up positions around the littered playground, dozens of mothers and grandmothers emerged from tumbledown houses and walked to the school assembly hall. 
 Almost out of eyesight, several young men and boys -- wearing American baseball jerseys and expensive tennis shoes --watched the procession from far down the street. They dared not approach until the crowd passed. Then they came out from hiding, and gathered at a corner just outside the school fence, staring at the soldiers who stared at them. 
One of the men, a 23-year-old who called himself Holland, admitted that it was he who should be dead, not 10-year-old Desmone Smith. He said he was a leader in a street gang called "the Americans." Desmone, he explained, had been gunned down when members of a rival gang came looking for him.
Desmone ran into the gunfire to help a 4-year-old child who had tripped and fallen. Holland said he saw her fall, and kept running. He was still running, it seemed, from his conscience.
"If I could go in there, I would say, 'This killing has got to stop,' " Holland said, pointing to the school. "Things are out of control, man."
This is the urban wasteland known as Cape Flats, a sprawling ghetto, built by apartheid, on the arid plains some 15 miles and a world away from the elegant sections of this seaside city at the southern tip of Africa. Law enforcement officials estimate that the Cape Flats, with a population of some three million people, has become the murder capital of a nation that is considered one of the murder capitals of the world.
Street gangs have run life and death in these neighborhoods, occupied mostly by mixed-race people called "coloreds," for more than two decades. As legalized segregation swept through South Africa in the late 1960's, the white government forced mixed-race families out of their communities in the center of Cape Town and assigned them plots on the flat lands to the west. Extended family networks were broken and replaced by turf alliances.
Jonny Steinberg, an author who is currently working on a book about gangsters, said that the gangs first organized around illegal alcohol sales in mixed-race neighborhoods. They ran illegal bars, known as shabeens. Gang leaders recruited and trained new gang members in prison. The heavy police presence and racial restrictions of apartheid kept their operations limited to slums and townships.
After white rule ended nine years ago, and the borders opened to foreign trade, the gangs forged alliances with international crime organizations that dealt in everything from cocaine to poached abalone, which fetches $60 per plate in elegant Asian restaurants. Their operations have crept into the city, where they run prostitution rings and nightclubs. And as the Cape Flats gangs step up in the world, police said, their clashes have intensified at home. 
According to statistics by the South Africa Police Service, the homicide rate has dropped in almost all urban areas of the country, except the Western Cape region, which includes Cape Flats. The SAPS reported the number of homicides for the Western Cape had increased from more than 1,860 in 1994 to almost 2,400 in 2001.
In recent weeks, the violence has shaken the nation. Five children were killed in one recent week earlier this month. Desmone Smith, who loved to sing along with Kirk Franklin CD's, died of a gunshot wound to the head.
After the shooting, police struck back with raids by hundreds of officers. Some 252 people -- including dozens of juveniles -- were arrested over two days last week.
"Catching the killers is never hard for us, but the problem is you are talking about people who are not deterred by prison," said a police superintendent, Jeremy Veary. "In jail, the prison gangs will reward them for what they did. And when they come out, they'll have more clout on the streets."
"What you have in Cape Flats is more than a group of crime organizations," Superintendent Veary added. "Gang life is a deep and complex subculture."
A drive through Cape Flats and conversations with numerous gangsters offer a glimpse of a depressing underworld that is as much a product of the new South Africa as the old. It is a world driven by widespread unemployment, crippled schools and rampant corruption.
A former gang member points out the home of the area's biggest crime boss, where residents line up for daily hand-outs of bread and canned foods. Jeffrey Arendse, an elementary school principal, explained that most of his students cannot afford to pay the $9 annual school fees, and that most of them live only on the slice of bread and glass of milk they are given each morning before classes.
"Of course the boys here dream of being gangsters," he said, showing the dozens of fake guns, real switchblades and pouches of marijuana he has seized from his students. "It's their only hope for becoming somebody."
Neighborhood ministers plead with parents to stop protecting the gangsters in their own families.
"Most of the people here are unemployed. They have no food," said the Rev. Tommy Klein. "So when a son comes home with a bloody knife and a 100-rand note, his mother keeps quiet, and helps him clean off the knife."
At times, Cape Flats feels a lot like South Central Los Angeles, home to the Bloods and Crips gangs. Even though most of the gangsters here will only get to Los Angeles in their dreams, and barely speak English, they express a deep affinity with West Coast rap and East Coast clothes. Murals feature Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur. The gangsters tattoo the names of American rappers on their chests. They greet each other with hand signals and secret handshakes.
In a neighborhood controlled by "the Hard Livings," guys hanging out on street corners talked tough, showing off old bullet wounds on their legs and chests. But after a couple of bottles of Black Label beer, the bravado gave way to more honest assessments of their lives.
"Don't you have a job for me?" asked one gang member, who asked not to reveal his name. "That is our real problem here. We have no future."
Back outside Kalksteenfontein Elementary School, Holland -- known as "Blood Stain" among the Americans gang -- said he had thought about seeking revenge for Desmone's murder. But he points out he has a son of his own. And his instincts as a father have begun to drown out the gangster's call.
"My son lives in my enemies' territory," he said. "If I go shooting at them, my son could be the next kid to die."

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Remain High 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20 

 BODY:
The number of workers seeking jobless benefits exceeded 400,000 for a fifth week and the index of leading indicators fell the most in February since September, two reports released today showed.
 Initial jobless claims totaled 421,000 in the week ended last Friday and 425,000 the previous week, the Labor Department said today. 
In a separate report, the Conference Board, a private research group, said February's gauge of the economy over the next three to six months fell 0.4 percent, matching expectations. A third report, from the Federal Reserve, said that manufacturing in the Philadelphia area shrank this month by the most since December 2001. 
 "These data are disappointing but are entirely consistent with other evidence pointing to a loss of momentum in the economy in the run-up to war with Iraq," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
The Fed Bank of Philadelphia's general economic index dropped to minus 8.0 this month from 2.3 in February. A negative reading means that a higher percentage of the manufacturers surveyed reported that business had deteriorated than improved.
The number of Americans collecting unemployment benefits rose to the highest level in almost four months, according to the report today, underscoring how companies were hesitant to hire ahead of the United States-led attack on Iraq.
The less-volatile four-week average of claims rose to 424,750 from 421,000, the highest since the week ended May 4.
The drop in the Conference Board's index of leading indicators was the largest since a 0.5 percent decline in September. The index was up a revised 0.2 percent in January.

HEADLINE: What Will Sell When Duct Tape Is Passe? 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
WHAT did you buy after the war, Daddy?
 As the American invasion of Iraq begins, it is hard to remember a time when people were more sure about who would win a war, and less sure of what would happen after it. 
 The most remarkable part of the Federal Reserve's statement this week was its admission of ignorance as it left rates unchanged.
"In light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decision making, the committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks with respect to the prospects for its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth," the Fed said. "In the current circumstances, heightened surveillance is particularly informative." 
In fact, the greatest fear that the Fed should have now is that the economy will falter, despite all its easing, without any obvious event to blame. The 2001 recession began six months before Sept. 11, but in the popular mind, that event is still seen as a prime cause of the downturn. If the war ends well, and quickly, and there is no big terrorist attack, then we will see if the economy is now ready to start growing again.
There are reasons to think that it will. A good war outcome would bring down oil prices, improving the real income of every driver and freeing money for other things. Corporate chief financial officers, polled by Duke University and Financial Executives International, a trade group, voice confidence that sales will pick up if the war ends quickly, but express concern about the effect of a terrorist attack or a long war. If they act on those beliefs, victory could bring a needed revival in capital spending.
Investors clearly hope that all will work out. In the stock market rally since prices hit bottom on March 11, nearly everything has risen, but growth stocks have done best. That "conveys a sense of optimism that the economy will not be materially affected by the current conflict," said Sam Stovall of Standard & Poor's.
But the reality is that the economic statistics since the beginning of the year have been consistently disappointing. Looking for a business that was improving, the Fed's staff found one in the Beige Book prepared in advance of this week's meeting: "Terrorism fears boosted the sales of duct tape, plastic and other hardware goods."
Yesterday, the Philadelphia Fed said that nearly half the companies it surveyed had delayed capital spending plans since the beginning of the year, and a third had delayed plans to hire workers. Only a handful had stepped up plans for hiring or spending.
Some of the weakness can be blamed on war jitters. And some economic statistics may have overstated the decline because they did not adequately adjust for the severe winter. But there are also reasons to fear that consumers are cutting back because they feel overextended and are no longer so confident that strong economic growth will return soon. Auto sales are sagging, and production cutbacks may come soon.
Low interest rates are still a plus for housing -- mortgage refinancings are at record levels -- but the real cost of buying a house may be rising. With the federal government not very interested in helping the states through their current budget crises, and some states similarly frugal when it comes to aid for local governments, the way out in many places is likely to be higher property taxes, both because of rising tax rates and reassessments.
The economy would certainly be hurt if the war ends badly, or if a new terrorism attack unnerves Americans. But it is less clear whether a quick victory would get the economy moving again.
The Fed's doubt is understandable. But it is not encouraging.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: WALL STREET; 
Amid Tight Security, Market Extends Recent Rally

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Precautionary measures on Wall Street, most evident in canceled trips and heightened security, did not extend to the stock market yesterday as investors reacted calmly to hostilities after the long walkup to war.
 The additional security and backup plans made after the Sept. 11 attacks have been augmented and have contributed to a sense of determination on Wall Street. Investors, likewise, have been anticipating war for days and weeks and did not move their money in haste. 
 The three main stock gauges rebounded from early losses to finish slightly higher yesterday, giving the Dow Jones industrial average its first seven-day streak of gains since August 2000. Investor sentiment that war appeared inevitable -- and, therefore, possibly soon over -- has driven the three gauges up more than 9 percent each in that time. 
Some stock markets fell in Europe soon after the cruise missile attack on Baghdad, but the declines were modest, and major stock markets ended higher in Asia. Many emerging stock markets, which can be vulnerable at times of geopolitical turbulence, also managed to record gains on the day, although Turkey experienced a sharp decline.
Prices and yields were little changed in the bond market, suggesting that there was no rush to the haven of the Treasury market as the war began.
"When we got to the point that it appeared we were going to war no matter what, people said one way or another we are going to win," said William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics in Boston, adding that this sentiment helped send stocks higher over the last several days.
"But the question now is how does this thing play out?" he said. "Will it be messy or will it be clean?"
Widespread hopes of a quick resolution could make markets volatile. Any bad news from the war could erode the recent gains. Investors also have to contend with unusual uncertainty about the outlook for the economy. Federal Reserve policy makers said when they met Tuesday that they were unable to assess "the current balance of risks."
On Wall Street, there were some signs of heightened security. Some investment firms and the major stock markets said that they had long been well prepared, with backup trading floors and communications networks. For security reasons, spokesmen for the markets and the firms were reluctant to discuss preparations.
"Post-9/11, a lot of things were tightened up, and I am not sure how much tighter you could get," said an executive at a Wall Street firm. "But if some of that had been relaxed, I'm sure it's been tightened up recently."
Measures of caution were apparent yesterday at the Deutsche Bank headquarters in Midtown Manhattan and at the headquarters of J. P. Morgan Chase on Park Avenue. At Deutsche Bank, guards were checking identification cards and examining bags and briefcases of people entering the building.
At J. P. Morgan Chase, everyone was funneled through one entrance, which was covered by a tent. Identification cards were checked visually and electronically before entry, again visually once inside, and visually and electronically one more time before anyone entered the elevators.
Because of the threat of a war, J. P. Morgan canceled a foreign exchange conference scheduled for Mexico. In its place, the firm was playing host to dinners in New York, Wednesday and last night, according to David Puth, the global head of foreign exchange and commodities.
Deutsche Bank, however, is going ahead with a program it is sponsoring at the Inter-American Development Bank meeting in Milan, and will send executives from New York to attend, said Rohini Pragasam, a bank spokeswoman. J. P. Morgan said its executives would attend as well.
The New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market and the American Stock Exchange have said that they have the backup facilities to prevent major disruptions in trading. Though they generally declined to be more specific, the New York Exchange said that it could begin trading within a day in backup trading facilities if its Wall Street trading floor were not usable.
The Treasury issued a statement this week, highlighting measures that have been taken to assure that markets can continue to function through any emergency. Among other steps, it cited access to priority telecommunication services during a crisis and moves to eliminate "single points of failure in the telecommunications infrastructure that supports the financial markets."
The failure of communications systems contributed to the closing of the stock markets for four days and the bond market for two days after 9/11.
Micah S. Green, president of the Bond Market Association, said that the "government regulators, the association, our members and others have all taken a number of steps to deal with an emergency like a terrorist attack." 
The Dow finished the day up 21.15 points, or 0.3 percent, at 8,286.60. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.82 points, or 0.2 percent, to 875.84. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 5.70 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,402.77, for a gain of 5 percent for the year. 
The Dow and the S.& P. 500 have now trimmed their losses to less than 1 percent for the year.
Still, the report of a decline in manufacturing in the Philadelphia area and the fifth consecutive week of unemployment claims exceeding 400,000 were reminders that the mere threat of war has probably slowed economic growth. 
In the bond market, the negative news probably helped lift the price of the 10-year note by 7/32 to 99 10/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 3.96 percent, from 3.99 percent Wednesday. 
The 10-year yield, however, is still well above its low of 3.57 percent of March 10, indicating that many investors have left the haven of bonds for stocks.
The dollar fell 0.3 percent against the euro yesterday, to $1.0603, and slipped 0.1 percent against the Japanese yen, to 120.40.
Like the stock market, the dollar has rallied against the euro since a war began to appear to be inevitable, rising 4.2 percent in the last seven days.

HEADLINE: Saudis Have Been Raking In Oil Money 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, March 20 

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia, with the world's biggest oil reserves and greatest excess pumping capacity of all oil-producing nations, is often lauded for dampening rising oil prices during periods of strife by increasing its crude oil output. But the often ignored flip side of that action is a crescendo of cash.
 Elevated oil prices and expanded production as a result of the Iraqi conflict are already pouring as much as a billion extra dollars a week into Saudi Arabia's coffers and could double the government's oil revenues this year. 
 "They're raking it in," said a Western oil executive here in the kingdom's capital. And this in a country that is deeply opposed to the war that is responsible for its windfall. 
Since late last year, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries have been ratcheting up output as anxiety over a war with Iraq, heightened United States demand during an unusually cold winter and interrupted Venezuelan production pushed oil prices steadily higher.
Saudi Arabia, which is normally limited by OPEC quotas to producing just over 7 million barrels a day, is now pumping 9 million barrels a day. That output could surge as high as 10.5 million barrels a day -- its full capacity -- if the country makes up for lost Iraqi production during the war. All other OPEC countries are already producing at or near capacity.
Rumors have circulated for weeks that Saddam Hussein was rigging Iraq's oil wells with explosives in hopes of slowing an invasion and raising the cost of reconstruction for any new government. Iraq set fire to Kuwaiti oil fields during the first Persian Gulf war in 1991, and some southern Iraqi oil fields were reported on Thursday to be on fire, possibly sabotaged by Iraqi troops.
There are also fears that the terrorist network Al Qaeda will try to disrupt global oil supplies by attacking pipelines or other facilities. Al Qaeda followers attacked a French oil tanker off the coast of Yemen last year.
The Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, pledged on Thursday to work with fellow OPEC members to maintain market stability. Saudi officials often complain that they are underappreciated for their role in keeping the world's oil reasonably priced and readily available.
The boon is a welcome one for a country whose economy, despite popular images of bejeweled princes and bedazzling palaces, has been in the doldrums for years. The Saudi economy, adjusted for inflation, grew by only about one percent last year.
"Government revenues this year could hit a level not seen since the early 1980's," said Said al-Shaikh, chief economist for the country's National Commercial Bank.
Saudi Arabia's excess capacity, while providing a valuable mechanism for stabilizing oil prices and protecting the United States and other heavily oil-dependent economies from energy shocks, is the result of a huge miscalculation in the early 1980's, when the global demand for oil was expected to keep rising.
The kingdom invested billions in new wells, pumping stations and pipelines only to have demand slacken and oil prices plunge. The government tumbled deep into debt, and the economy fell into a slump from which it has yet to emerge.
The unexpected revenue -- as much as $28 billion -- will more than offset what had been projected to be a $10 billion budget deficit this year. The rest could be used to pay down some of the government's daunting domestic debt, which at more than $170 billion now about equals the country's total economic output for a year.
But that does not mean the war will cure Saudi Arabia's blues. The war's economic echo will eventually fade, and many economists doubt that the government will spend much of its windfall on new projects this year with so much uncertainty in the region.
Saudis also fear that once oil fields in Iraq are back up and running, any new government there will invest heavily to upgrade and expand the oilfields, providing the global oil market with a huge new source of supply, diluting demand and depressing prices.
"They'll get by with another easy year, but the long term trend is probably negative growth," a Western diplomat said.

HEADLINE: Who Lost The U.S. Budget? 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The Onion describes itself as "America's finest news source," and it's not an idle boast. On Jan. 18, 2001, the satirical weekly bore the headline "Bush: Our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity is finally over," followed by this mock quotation: "We must squander our nation's hard-won budget surplus on tax breaks for the wealthiest 15 percent. And, on the foreign front, we must find an enemy and defeat it."
 Whatever our qualms about how we got here, all Americans now hope that the foreign front proceeds according to plan. Meanwhile, let's talk about the fiscal front. 
 The latest official projections acknowledge (if you read them carefully) that the long-term finances of the U.S. government are in much worse shape than the administration admitted a year ago. But many commentators are reluctant to blame George W. Bush for that grim outlook, preferring instead to say something like this: "Sure, you can criticize those tax cuts, but the real problem is the long-run deficits of Social Security and Medicare, and the unwillingness of either party to reform those programs."
Why is this line appealing? It seems more reasonable to blame longstanding problems for our fiscal troubles than to attribute them to just two years of bad policy decisions. Also, many pundits like to sound "balanced," pronouncing a plague on both parties' houses. To accuse the current administration of wrecking the federal budget sounds, well, shrill -- and we don't want to sound shrill, do we?
There's only one problem with this reasonable, balanced, non-shrill position: it's completely wrong. The Bush tax cuts, not the retirement programs, are the main reason why our fiscal future suddenly looks so bleak.
I base that statement on a new study that compares the size of the Bush tax cuts with that of the prospective deficits of Social Security and Medicare. The results are startling.
Accountants estimate the "actuarial balance" of Social Security and Medicare the same way a private insurance company would: they calculate the present value of projected revenues and outlays, and find the difference. (The present value of a future expense is the amount you would have to invest today to have the money when the bill comes due. For example, if $1 invested in U.S. government bonds would be worth $2 by the year 2020, then the present value of $2 in 2020 is $1 today.) And both programs face shortfalls: the estimated actuarial deficit of Social Security over the next 75 years is $3.5 trillion, and that of Medicare is $6.2 trillion.
But how do these shortfalls compare with the fiscal effects of recent and probable future tax cuts?
The new study, carried out by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, estimates the present value of the revenue that will be lost because of the Bush tax cuts -- those that have already taken place, together with those that have been proposed -- using the same economic assumptions that underlie those Medicare and Social Security projections. The total comes to $12 trillion to $14 trillion -- more than the Social Security and Medicare shortfalls combined. What this means is that the revenue that will be sacrificed because of those tax cuts is not a minor concern. On the contrary, that revenue would have been more than enough to "top up" Social Security and Medicare, allowing them to operate without benefit cuts for the next 75 years. 
The administration has tried to deny this conclusion, inventing strange new principles of accounting in the process. But the simple truth is that the Bush tax cuts have utterly transformed our fiscal outlook, for the worse. Without those tax cuts, the problems of an aging population might well have been manageable; with them, nothing short of an economic miracle can save us from a fiscal crisis.
And there's a lesson here that goes beyond fiscal policies. On almost every front the outlook for the United States now seems far bleaker than it did two years ago. Has everything gone wrong because of evildoers and external forces? In the case of the budget -- and the economy and, yes, foreign policy -- the answer is no. The world has turned out to be a tougher place than we thought a few years ago, but things didn't have to be nearly this bad.
The fault lies not in our stars, but in our leadership.

HEADLINE: Hospital Chief Stepping Down After a Year 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Barely a year after taking office on a pledge to restore the Mount Sinai Medical Center to economic health, its chief executive, Dr. Kenneth I. Berns, is leaving his post, and up to 500 health care workers will be laid off in a hospitalwide shake-up, administrators said yesterday. 
 The job cuts, which will take effect within the next few weeks, come on top of the loss of about 430 positions already cut over the last year, as the hospital -- long one of the nation's premier teaching hospitals and an imposing presence on Manhattan's Upper East Side -- has struggled with problems in its finances, its administration and its medical reputation. 
 Dr. Berns, a 64-year-old geneticist who was recruited to Mount Sinai from the University of Florida, will remain on the staff as a professor of genetic research in the medical school. He will be replaced by Dr. Kenneth L. Davis, 56, who is currently the dean of the medical school. Dr. Davis, who has been at Mount Sinai since 1979, will remain dean and add Dr. Berns's responsibilities to his own. 
Mount Sinai has more than 11,000 employees. 
"We deeply appreciate the leadership that Dr. Berns has provided over the last year," said Peter W. May, the medical center chairman, "and we are pleased that he will be a part of Mount Sinai's research efforts." 
A hospital spokesman, Dr. Gary Rosenberg, said that while the change was not Dr. Berns's idea, he was involved in discussions of the reorganization and was not being removed for poor performance.
"He was party to the discussion and he fully agreed" that his best contribution would be in his own research specialty, Dr. Rosenberg said.
Dr. Berns could not be reached for comment; a woman in his office said he was attending an event off campus. 
Administrators said the leadership change and the job cuts reflected two deep but very different problems at Mount Sinai. 
Reducing the staff, the administrators said, is part of a yearlong reorganization process to help stem steep financial losses, which are partly the result of rising costs from insurance, drugs and emergency preparedness, especially after the terrorism attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. 
The change in administration, they said, addresses the core nature of the institution. In many ways it represents the final refutation of the merger with N.Y.U. Medical Center in 1998, which is widely regarded within the hospital industry, and within Mount Sinai, as a failure.
The merger separated the medical school and the hospital, a change that also separated the functions of research and patient care. Under Dr. Davis, they will once again be reunited under one head, as they were for most of Mount Sinai's history. 
"This will really bring the medical school and hospital into a unified position, where we were before the merger," Dr. Rosenberg said. "After the merger they were separately administered, and that didn't work." 
Mount Sinai is certainly not alone among New York hospitals in facing money troubles. Industry experts say those problems are likely to deepen this year as the fiscal crisis in Albany ripples out, especially through proposed cuts in reimbursement under the Medicaid system, which helps hospitals care for the poor.
For Mount Sinai, though, the struggle has been harder and longer. The death early last year of a partial-liver donor from an infection, partly because of what investigators said was inadequate medical supervision, led the state to order the hospital to suspend transplants for six months. At the same time, the hospital began closing clinics, laying off workers and imposing new cost controls in hopes of containing its financial losses. 
Hospital industry experts said the job cuts announced yesterday, while partly reflecting Mount Sinai's specific situation, could very likely be echoed at other hospitals in the months ahead as losses continue across the industry.
"This is evidence that the concern about the financial stress being felt by New York City hospitals is real," said James R. Tallon Jr., the president of the United Hospital Fund, a research and philanthropic group based in Manhattan. "It certainly demonstrates that in the hospitals, we're dealing with both smoke and fire."

HEADLINE: U.S. Considers Fuel Economy Rule Changes 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 20 

 BODY:
The Bush administration is considering changes to fuel economy regulations that would encourage manufacturers to offer more large cars, station wagons and smaller sport utility vehicles that are built more like cars. 
 The idea behind the changes is that such vehicles are safer than both small cars and sport utility vehicles and pickups, and that if more people drove them, fewer people would die in crashes. Producing more such vehicles and fewer very small or very large vehicles would reduce the increasing disparity among American vehicles, both in weight and how high they ride. 
 Because they ride so high, sport utility vehicles and pickups pose more dangers to drivers of small cars than large cars do. They are also more dangerous for their own occupants because of their increased rollover risk. 
But the idea is opposed by environmentalists and has already drawn a sharply worded protest from the United Automobile Workers union. Both are concerned, for different reasons, that the Big Three will stop making small cars because they lose money making them and will no longer be compelled to. 
For the last several months, representatives of the Department of Energy, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and several other federal agencies have been exploring changes to the way fuel economy is regulated. 
Under the current system, in effect since the 1970's, automakers must meet one average for their fleets of cars (currently 27.5 miles per gallon) and a much lower average (20.7 miles per gallon) for their light trucks, which include sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans.
To reach those averages, automakers generally build small vehicles with higher fuel economy to offset large, less fuel-efficient vehicles. 
The change being considered by the Bush administration will not be described for a month or two, in an initial proposal for fuel economy in the 2008 model year and beyond. But the type of system being considered could eliminate the distinction between cars and light trucks and instead base fuel economy requirements on the weight or size of vehicles.
So automakers would no longer have to build small cars to help reach the average required of all cars. As for the largest sport utilities and pickups, the fuel economy standard could in theory be raised enough to force the automakers to make such vehicles smaller. As a result, fewer vehicles on the road would be either very big or very small.
"Large passenger cars and minivans are the safest way to move around large numbers of people," said Dr. Jeffrey W. Runge, the Bush administration's top auto safety regulator, at a conference in January. "And yet," he added, referring to the current system of corporate average fuel economy standards, known as CAFE, "we have CAFE-ed large cars out of existence." 
"We need a quantum leap in fuel economy without sacrificing safety," he added. 
Such a system could "enhance fuel efficiency while protecting safety," said John D. Graham, administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget, who is chairman of the interagency committee. Fuel economy regulations, and their effect on vehicle weight and safety, have been a focus of research for Dr. Graham for more than a decade. 
Environmentalists fear Detroit will scrap the most fuel-efficient models and the Bush administration will not require significant improvements in fuel economy. The U.A.W. fears for the workers who make such vehicles and says tens of thousands of jobs are at stake.
"This could lead to the elimination of small-car production by the Big Three automakers in the United States, with the resulting loss of thousands of good-paying jobs," said Alan Reuther, the union's legislative director, in a letter this month to Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, and Ernest F. Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat, the ranking members of the Senate Commerce Committee.
Gary Skulnik, a Sierra Club lobbyist on global warming and energy issues, said "the Big Three would have no incentive to make smaller, more fuel-efficient cars."
"The way the system is currently structured," he said, "they have to sell some of these Ford Focuses, or cars like that, to balance out all the gas guzzlers they are selling."
Automakers are generally upbeat, though cautious, about the idea. Several said in interviews today that they wanted to wait until the administration lays out details.
"It's a more realistic approach and doesn't force the sale of small vehicles that are not that popular," said Mike Morrissey, a spokesman for General Motors.
"We see a full range of passenger cars as important to our long-term strategy," he added, "but it will allow us to have a more market-reflective strategy."
Jim Olson, a spokesman for Toyota, said, "The devil's in the details."
"Weight-based is something we've looked at in the past and we have thought it makes some sense. But, and I emphasize this, any CAFE scheme depends on how you structure it."
The plan could be structured like one laid out in a 2001 National Academy of Sciences report. In that system, all vehicles under two tons would be put into weight classes; vehicles heavier than that would be subject to a single average, be they cars or trucks. The theoretical effect would be to pressure manufacturers to make their heaviest vehicles lighter and their lightest vehicles heavier.
"We think a weight-based system makes a lot of sense, depending on the criteria and the formula used," said R. David Pittle, a senior vice president at Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports. "It's a thinking man's scheme to improve fuel economy," he said. 
Some people are concerned that such a system, depending on how it was structured, could encourage automakers to make some vehicles unnecessarily heavier to fit in less-fuel-efficient categories. If downsizing cars has been an issue, the automotive fleet at large has been bulging in size, contributing to plummeting gas mileage over the last two decades and imbalances that endanger car occupants in collisions with sport utilities. 
Edward B. Cohen, Honda's top Washington lobbyist, said that such a system should be based on sizes -- subcompact or compact -- and not weight. A new study sponsored by Honda says decreasing the cumulative weight of the nation's automobiles would improve safety. "We're certainly open to examining the issue," Mr. Cohen said, "but we feel that it would be selling the potential of the attribute system short if weight was the only attribute considered."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE MOOD; 
A Mundane Thursday, Shadowed by Foreboding

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN with DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: OAK BROOK, Ill., March 20 

 BODY:
Pat Muller and Peggy Hrubec did not consider canceling their sisterly shopping expedition this morning, just because their country had begun bombing Baghdad.
 But now that the war has begun, Ms. Muller, 53, does plan to show Ms. Hrubec where all her important papers are before she goes to Las Vegas at month's end, "in case the plane goes down or is sabotaged," she said. Ms. Hrubec, 48, said she would probably "throw in an extra Mass this week." 
 "There was this sense of foreboding," Ms. Muller said as the two women headed to celebrate her approaching birthday over lunch at Wildfire, a popular steakhouse where the 15-minute wait for a table was slightly shorter than usual. "I wouldn't say there's more fear today. It's almost like, let's get it over with." 
The first day of the attack on Iraq unfolded as a mundane Thursday in much of the nation, as people struggled to balance celebrating the first signs of spring with a nagging sense that the mood should be somber.
They went to work, where coffee-break chatter was as likely to be about the opening round of the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament as about foreign policy. They went to class, where some walked out for the latest in a series of coordinated campus protests. They went to lunch, as televisions above the bar showing Iraq aglow with explosions and anti-aircraft fire.
"It feels like it should feel different," said Marci Oser, 29, as she turned a planned evacuation drill at her Chicago office building into a smoke break, "but it doesn't." 
Many retail shops, restaurants, car dealerships and real-estate agencies reported fewer customers than usual throughout the day, particularly in New York, though the Mall of America outside Minneapolis was extracrowded, with scores of children on spring break riding the roller coaster. Wal-Mart saw spikes in sales of bottled water, canned meat and propane stoves. Reservations for Hertz rental cars were down and cancellations were up. 
"I'm most worried about what's coming next," said Rozalind Brack, 65, the owner of Rozalind, a women's clothing store in Alexandria, Va. "I don't think it's going to be too long before we're attacked again, which makes it hard to get people excited that pink is going to be the big color this spring."
But even as the war's debut disrupted some business, economists were relieved to be free of some of the uncertainty that has been delaying the economic recovery. They expected companies to start making long-delayed decisions about hiring and ordering equipment.
David A. Daberko, chief executive of the National City Corporation, a bank with 1,100 branches in the Midwest, said some of his employees had decided to forgo the free trips to Florida they received as rewards.
"The real issue is not the war," Mr. Daberko said. "It's terrorism and the effect the war will have on terrorism. That's what weighs on the minds of business people and consumers."
What was weighing on the mind of Jim Anderson of Butte, Mont., was keeping track of the 15 cars full of friends and relatives who caravanned to Salt Lake City to watch Gonzaga University's basketball team beat Cincinnati, 74-69, at the Huntsman Center.
In the stands, Leah Felt, with a basketball brooch on her red sweater, chose to sit through the moment of silence before tipoff. "I'm so angry about this war," Ms. Felt explained. Her daughter, Marion Felt, stood, saying, "If we are going to fight, I am going to support the troops."
March Madness took on new meaning in a split-screen nation.
At Wildfire, in the Oakbrook Shopping Center here in this suburb 25 miles west of Chicago, one television showed Marquette University beating Holy Cross while another showed Chicagoans talking about the war. At the Argosy Casino in Baton Rouge, La., patrons demanded, "We want to watch the tournament!" Eric Bornholdt, the bartender, switched 6 of his 12 televisions's to ESPN, but left the sound up on the news.
At Logan International Airport in Boston, Daniel Brooks, an accountant from Peoria, Ill., who stayed up late Wednesday watching news of the war, nursed a cup of clam chowder as he filled out an N.C.A.A. tournament bracket for a pool.
"I'm trying to pay as much attention to what's going on overseas," Mr. Brooks said as CNN appeared on the television over his left shoulder, "but I have to call my buddy and let him know what my picks are." 
Barbara Karrman of Platteville, Wis., said she planned to do "some channel flipping" tonight.
"I have to support the troops," Ms. Karrman said while getting her hair done in Madison. "I also have to support the Badgers."
With war having been predicted for weeks, most people said today's events were simply the inevitable coming to pass. Many struggled to muster adequate interest. Others mourned the failure of diplomacy, worried about the potential loss of life and tried to quell their nerves.
In Laguna Beach, Calif., Anthony Rojas, a Navy reservist, shot hoops by the Pacific with his five sons, ages 3 to 12. "We've been talking about the war most of the day," said Mr. Rojas, 34, who returned in October from a deployment in Bahrain and Kuwait. "Basically, today, I just wanted to come to the beach and enjoy time with my kids. Because you never know. You just never know."
In Dearborn, Mich., home to the nation's highest concentration of Muslim Arab Americans, Zeinab Abbas said her sister did not want to wear the traditional head scarf to school this morning. "I don't feel American," said Ms. Abbas, 19, an American citizen. "As soon as something happens like this, I am not looked at as an American."
Here in Oak Book, Karen Bushy, the mayor, awoke this morning to find her pager on the fritz. Because of the war, she sent for a new one instead of waiting to have it fixed. The village sent an extra fire truck to a routine alarm at the shopping center, just in case.
"I just feel like the world is not the same place it was yesterday," said Ray Baker, 58, who worked his normal shift at a hospital but planned to go to the federal building in downtown Chicago this evening in search of an antiwar rally. "I feel like I can no longer sit on the sidelines."
Lee Nicosia, a middle school English teacher, took advantage of the power failure at her school to power-shop at Costco, but she said the war was definitely on her mind.
"Did I park myself in front of the TV and watch every little thing? No," she said. "Will I turn on the TV as soon as I get home? Yes. Am I proud to be an American? Yes. Did I buy French wine? Hell, no."
Wednesday night, Mrs. Nicosia, called her 21-year-old son, Joey, who lives in a Boston high-rise, and spoke also to his girlfriend, Lauren Kroll, who confessed that she was scared. Mrs. Nicosia recalled: "She actually said to my son, which is so heart-breaking, 'Do you think we ought to go get canned goods?' "

HEADLINE: BUSINESS DIGEST 

 BODY:
HealthSouth Puts Chairman On Leave in Fraud Case
HealthSouth put its embattled chairman on leave after regulators accused the company of sweeping accounting fraud.
 Investors and analysts struggled to understand the extent of the deception described in a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. HealthSouth and its chairman, Richard M. Scrushy, are accused of adding at least $1.4 billion to earnings since 1999 and inflating assets by $800 million. Page C4. 

If HealthSouth, which employs about 3,500 in Birmingham, Ala., files Chapter 11, it could put a crimp on the local economy. C4.

Electronic Data Chief Is Ousted
Electronic Data Systems, which has been battered over the last year by earnings shortfalls and questions about its accounting practices, said that it had replaced Richard H. Brown, left, its chief executive, with Michael H. Jordan, the retired chairman and chief executive of CBS. Also, Jeffrey M. Heller, who retired a year ago as vice chairman, has returned as president and chief operating officer. C2.

Karmazin and Viacom Reach Pact
Mel Karmazin has agreed to stay at Viacom for three more years, despite his chilly relations with Sumner M. Redstone, the company's chief executive. C4.

32% Increase in Barnes & Noble Net
Barnes & Noble reported a 32 percent increase in its fourth-quarter profit, beating Wall Street projections despite weak sales growth. C2.

Cisco to Buy Networking Concern
Cisco Systems agreed to buy Linksys Group, a leading maker of computer-networking equipment for homes and small business, for about $500 million in stock to expand beyond large corporate customers. C4.

Solectron said it would lay off 12,000 employees and cut costs by $300 million. C4.

Jobless Claims Exceed 400,000
The number of workers seeking jobless benefits exceeded 400,000 for a fifth week and the index of leading indicators fell in February, two reports showed. A third report said that manufacturing in the Philadelphia area shrank this month. C10.

Fed Explains Its Policy Stance
Minutes showed that Federal Reserve policy makers were bedeviled by difficulties predicting how the wobbly economy would hold up during a war with Iraq at their meeting this week and in January. This led them to hold interest rates at a 41-year low both times. C10.

Strong Showing by Wall St. Firms
Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers beat expectations in the first quarter, their profits driven by soaring bond and commodities trading revenues. Net income at Goldman rose 26 percent; at Morgan Stanley 7 percent; and at Lehman 1 percent. Shares of Goldman fell 19 cents, to $70.08; shares of Lehman fell 16 cents, to $59.53; and shares of Morgan Stanley rose 57 cents, to $40.05. C3.

Regulators Dismiss Audit Proposal
An effort by the accounting profession's trade group to propose auditing standards has received a tart response from regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission wrote in a letter that the proposal could "create the misleading impression" that it would someday become binding on auditors. C3.

HEADLINE: The Rise and Fall of Richard Scrushy, Entrepreneur 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala., March 20 

 BODY:
Charities and community leaders here reacted with dismay yesterday and braced for the possible loss of a big donor and employer after the disclosure of accounting irregularities at the hospital chain built by Richard M. Scrushy, this city's most flamboyant entrepreneur.
 Because of the continuing criminal inquiry, Mr. Scrushy's assets have been frozen. Meanwhile, his company, HealthSouth, could face bankruptcy soon if it is not rescued by creditors. 
 HealthSouth, which operates a chain of rehabilitation hospitals, employs about 3,500 people in Birmingham, and any disruption in its business would be a drag on the local economy.
"HealthSouth is a very significant presence both in terms of jobs and economic impact," said Dave Adkison, president of the Birmingham Regional Chamber of Commerce. "The fact that the F.B.I. had to raid HealthSouth obviously shocked a lot of us, but it wasn't totally surprising because the problems there had been building for some time."
Even before the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges against Mr. Scrushy this week, saying he had overseen a fraudulent scheme that allowed him to grow wealthy through the sale of the company's stock, the commission had been looking into other irregularities.
The F.B.I., which filed a criminal complaint on Wednesday against Weston Smith, HealthSouth's chief financial officer, disclosed last month that it was investigating possible securities law violations.
The difficulties at HealthSouth follow problems at another large Birmingham company, McWane Inc., a manufacturer of cast-iron sewer and water pipes that has been cited for more than 400 safety violations since 1995. 
For a city that had grown accustomed to Mr. Scrushy's public persona in recent years, the disclosure of the problems at HealthSouth came as a jolt. Mr. Scrushy (pronounced SCROO-shee) was known as much in Birmingham for his extravagant tastes, which included a Hummer oversize S.U.V., a luxurious Florida estate and a lead singing role in his own country music band, as he was for his philanthropy.
"Many charities have had to deal with the issue of having well-respected donors that didn't have the background you thought they did," said John J. McMahon Jr., president of the board of trustees of the University of Alabama. Mr. Scrushy was one of the university's main donors, and he helped finance several endeavors, including a school for health-related professions that bears his name.
"There are not a lot of people here that have the capacity or desire to be generous on that level," Mr. McMahon said in an interview. "I'm a long way from accepting that these charges are true because this is already unfortunate for the entire community."
Outside HealthSouth's modern headquarters, nothing seemed out of the ordinary, with construction of a state-of-the-art hospital in an adjacent area to the company proceeding amid towering cranes. Joel C. Gordon, named as interim chairman of the company after Mr. Scrushy was placed on administrative leave, introduced himself to employees in an afternoon speech.
People close to Mr. Scrushy, a native of Selma, Ala., who attended Jefferson State Community College before becoming a respiratory therapist and businessman, also tried to understand how the large public company he built could have been a fraud, as regulators and prosecutors say.
"He surrounded himself with strong, well-educated people," said Karon Brooks, Mr. Scrushy's former wife, who remains on friendly terms with him. "He's rather preoccupied at the moment, but he holds up well. He'll do everything he can to prove his innocence."
Others were not as sanguine about Mr. Scrushy's chances of emerging from the accounting scandal. "I'm shocked, but not surprised," said Hope Launies, a makeup artist who worked as a personal shopper for Leslie Scrushy, Mr. Scrushy's wife.
"Their life was about as unhindered by reality as one could imagine, and with freedom like that, comes the temptation to do anything you want," Ms. Launies said in an interview.

HEADLINE: Resisting Birth Control, the Philippines Grows Crowded 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: SAN ROQUE, the Philippines, March 15 

 BODY:
The more the merrier," said the cardinal, Jaime Sin, when asked a few years back about the country's population explosion, and his wish was granted.
 The population in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic country has doubled in the last half-century, to 80 million, and could double again in less time than that. 
 Under the influence of the powerful church, the Philippine government has done little to curb population growth and has taken a stand against modern methods of birth control.
"I never used that, my friend," said Manuel Musingi, 57, a schoolteacher in this tiny village where contraceptives are not available and are widely mistrusted. 
"I don't like them," he said. "They are not comfortable. You are not feeling comfortable when you use a condom. Likewise these pills, my wife doesn't want to take them. There are side effects."
Mr. Musingi is one of many people on the front edge of his country's population avalanche. He has 9 children. One of his neighbors has 12. Another has 13. In their poverty, their large families are their greatest source of pride.
"If you have many children you are a man," said Mr. Musingi as the voices of schoolchildren rang out in the courtyard. "You can reproduce yourself. Those that don't have any children, they cannot make their own child. You can't be called a man."
The Philippines is often compared with Thailand, which has a particularly active family planning program. In the 1970's, both countries had populations of about 50 million and economies of similar sizes.
Three decades later there are about 10 million more people in Thailand and about 30 million more in the Philippines.
Experts say the main cause of runaway population growth is the failure of the Philippine government to educate the public, to promote family planning and to make low-cost contraceptives widely available.
It is these policies that have made the difference in countries like Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Taiwan that have brought their population growth under control, according to a study by the East-West Center, a Pacific Basin research organizion based in Honolulu.
In the Philippines birth-control programs have been vigorously opposed by the church, which said recently that it would campaign in the next election against any politicians who support family planning, calling them "adulterers, fornicators and terrorists."
Retailers have been intimidated as well. Following public protests, the 7-11 grocery chain has stopped offering condoms for sale.
As the Philippines has grown more crowded, it has grown ever poorer, with 40 percent of its population now living on less than $1 a day. Jobs, food and farmland are increasingly scarce. Urban slums are teeming.
"The reality is that we cannot educate, provide health services and feed 130 million Filipinos by 2025," said Sen. Rodolfo Biazon, referring to one estimate of population growth.
While the population is growing by 2.36 percent a year, he said, food production is growing by only 1.9 percent. The population growth rate in Thailand, by contrast, now stands at 0.9 percent.
In a key measurement, Unicef puts the Philippine fertility rate -- the average number of births for each mother -- at 3.4, among the highest in the world outside Africa. In Thailand it is 2.1.
Half the Philippine population is of child-bearing age. Only half of these people use any form of birth control and only one-third use modern contraceptive methods, according to several studies.
One puzzle in a nation where condoms are not widespread is an extremely low rate of HIV infection. According to government figures, just 1,810 cases have been reported. The United Nations estimate is higher but still miniscule at 9,400 cases. Experts warn of an explosion to come.
According to local studies, only 23 percent of sexually active young men reported using a condom and only 4 percent said they use condoms regularly.
It is the women who bear the burden of raising large families and often seek to control their pregnancies. But the United States Agency for International development reports that one-fifth of women who want contraceptives do not have access to them.
One reason, the agency said, is that two thirds of the Philippine population cannot afford to buy condoms. It said the use of modern contraceptive methods would need to rise by 40 percent for women to achieve the family size they want.
In a speech last week, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo affirmed her backing for the "rhythm method" of natural contraception that critics say is unreliable, complicated to follow and requires unusual restraint on the part of husbands.
Mrs. Arroyo suggested that the rhythm method would promote family values by bringing spouses together, with the wife observing her body temperature, vaginal secretions and menstrual cycle and her husband writing them down on a chart.
It would also help teach patience, responsibility and self-control, according to the church.
This didn't seem to work when Mr. Musingi tried it.
"When I used the natural method, I used withdrawal," he said. "And sometimes when you get happy, very happy, some of your own cells will automatically splash, and here comes a baby."
Another problem was that, one after another, Mr. Musingi's babies were girls -- 7 of 9 of them -- and like many Filipino men, he wanted sons.
"That's why they come so many like that," he said. "It's a girl, and I have to make another baby. It's a girl again, so I have to try again."
With the government restricting public education about contraception, the public has learned about condoms in unorthodox says, said Terry L. Scott, the country director for DKT Philippines, a local nonprofit organization that advocates condom use.
Among the most effective teaching tools, he said, are the American television programs "Sex and the City" and "Friends."

TEXTRON SAYS IT WILL LAY OFF 1,200 WORKERS AT CESSNA

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 Textron Inc. said yesterday that it would lay off 1,200 employees in its Cessna Aircraft unit. 
It cited a reduction in an order placed by one of its two major business-jet customers and worldwide economic concerns. The company also said that it would reduce its earnings projections for the year, but gave no specific figure. Textron said the layoffs would be concentrated at Cessna's headquarters in Wichita, Kan., where 9,200 are employed. Other operations could be affected, including a Cessna plant in Columbus, Ohio, that employs 400 workers. Salaried and hourly positions will be eliminated, a spokeswoman said.

HEADLINE: World Briefing Americas: Cuba: Crackdown On Dissidents Continues 

BYLINE:  By David Gonzalez (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The government's crackdown on opposition groups continued when the police arrested a leading dissident on the 10th day of a fast for human rights. The dissident, Marta Beatriz Roque, an economist and former political prisoner who now leads a national association of civic groups, was arrested along with five other people. 
They had been fasting to demand the release of political prisoners, especially Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet, a physician and proponent of nonviolent resistance. Diplomats and human rights activists estimate that more than 60 dissidents and independent journalists have been arrested since Tuesday on charges of subversion and collaborating with American diplomats opposed to Fidel Castro's rule. Elizardo Sanchez, the head of a rights group, said the arrests were the largest number in recent years. "The Cuban government took advantage of the military situation in Iraq to launch this wave of repression hoping it would be obscured by the crisis," he said in a telephone interview. "It is an old and hidden dream of theirs to squash the opposition and silence the human rights movement." David Gonzalez (NYT)

HEADLINE: Europeans Worry About War's Economic Ripples 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 20 

 BODY:
As the war that so bitterly divided Europe began, Europeans today debated how it might affect their economies, with some experts noting that France and Germany could end up benefiting most from the conflict they opposed.
 A senior European Commission official said today that the war qualified as an "exceptional circumstance," which could free France and Germany from the strict limits on budget deficits they agreed to as members of Europe's monetary union. Both countries have breached those limits and face stiff fines if they do not bring their finances back into line. 
 The official, Pedro Solbes, who is monetary affairs commissioner, said it was too soon to discuss how much leeway they would be allowed. But his comments are a relief for France and Germany, which have pleaded with the commission to relax its rules amid a torpid economic climate. 
Some analysts asked why these countries would qualify for relief under this provision, since they are not supplying troops or financial support for the war. But a spokesman for Mr. Solbes said the provision also applied to indirect costs of a war, like the increased cost of domestic security.
"At this stage, nobody knows yet what the impact will be," said the spokesman, Gerassimos Thomas. 
Though Germany and France are not taking part in the fighting, they may participate in the postwar rebuilding of Iraq. The rebuilding will require billions of dollars in additional spending.
"Even Germany will probably help finance the rebuilding after the war, so they could invoke this clause," said Hans-Werner Sinn, president of the Ifo Institute, a leading economic research organization.
Germany and France set themselves on a collision course with the commission by running deficits that exceeded 3 percent of their gross domestic product in 2002. With their economies barely growing, analysts said, both are likely to breach the deficit cap again this year.
The prospect of budgetary relief for Germany and France contributed to a day of mixed messages in Europe's stock and currency markets. Stock markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris closed either little changed or down modestly from Wednesday. Investors, it seemed, were caught between relief that the war had begun, and uncertainty about how it will play out.
The euro, which fell against the United States dollar for the last several days, rallied today. Currency traders said the market's buoyant reaction to the end of months of diplomatic wrangling gave way to fear, after President Bush warned that the war could take longer than the public expects.
As the combat intensifies, analysts said they expected the euro to continue to rise against the dollar, largely because it is viewed as a safe haven. "The euro is not a great alternative to the dollar, but it is the best available alternative," said Michael Schubert, a currency expert at Commerzbank.
The rising euro has troubling implications for Europe because it increases the cost of its exports in the United States. In Germany, exports are the only part of the economy showing signs of life.
Mr. Sinn said the Ifo Institute reduced its forecast for Germany's growth in 2003, to 0.9 percent from 1.3 percent, largely to account for the negative effects of a stronger euro on German exports.
Some experts said the huge cost of the war to the United States could worsen the decline of the dollar against the euro. 
"We are entering a dollar bear market," said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. "The danger is that if it happens too fast, it would be bad for both sides."
So far, the European Central Bank has resisted calls to ease this trend by cutting interest rates. The bank's president, Wim Duisenberg, said he did not think the rise in the euro was a threat to Europe's competitiveness.
Today, the bank signaled it was watching events closely, and would inject funds into the market if necessary. In a statement after a meeting of the 18-member governing council, it said, "The impact of this military confrontation on the global economy can vary significantly in scope and size."
Some experts said the threat to Europe from a weak dollar was overblown. Exports to the United States account for only 10 to 15 percent of the overall trade volume of the European monetary union.
"For Germany, it is much more important that they get economic reforms going, to revive domestic demand, than to sell more Mercedeses or BMW's in the United States," said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels.
Given the sense of paralysis that has gripped Europeans for the last year, some economists even suggested that the onset of the war, so long anticipated, would be a welcome jolt. 
"Our assumption is that this will be a short war, and when it is over, the mood of consumers should improve," Mr. Sinn of the Ifo Institute said.

HEADLINE: Fed Explains Its January Stance 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 20 

 BODY:
Difficulties predicting how the wobbly United States economy would hold up during a war with Iraq bedeviled Federal Reserve policy makers at their meeting this week and in January led to the decision to hold interest rates at a 41-year low, according to minutes released today.
 Some members of the Fed also expressed concern about the effect on state and local governments of President Bush's proposal to eliminate taxes individuals pay on corporate dividends. 
 Against the backdrop of such uncertainties, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, and his Federal Open Market Committee colleagues decided at their meeting this week, on Tuesday, to keep interest rates at 1.25 percent, just as they had done at the meeting before, in late January.
"The committee could not rule out a range of plausible economic outcomes, including the possibility of a persisting subpar economic performance or a much stronger-than-forecast acceleration of the expansion," according to minutes of the January meeting.
"The members concluded that a wait-and-see policy stance was desirable pending an improved basis for judging the ongoing performance of the economy," the minutes said.
Some members of the Fed expressed concern that a prominent provision of the president's stimulus package -- elimination of taxes on dividends that shareholders pay -- could hurt the balance sheets of state and local governments because many of them link their taxable incomes to the those reported on federal returns.

HEADLINE: State Report Says City Relies Too Much on Outside Sources to Balance Budget 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The New York State Financial Control Board warned yesterday that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg should move on to Plan B to close the city's budget gap, because he is unlikely to get the help he is counting on from Albany, Washington and the city's unions.
 Mayor Bloomberg, meanwhile, reported more grim news from the city's budget front, telling a group of bankers that the city now expects to collect $300 million less in taxes next year because of the weak economy. The mayor signaled that the city was prepared to take more steps on its own to balance the budget, noting that more service cuts are coming and describing additional layoffs of city workers as "inevitable." 
 The control board, which has the power to take over the city's finances should it ever end a year in the red, issued a stern report warning that the city is too reliant on outside sources over which it has no control to balance its budget. 
The report calculated that the city is counting on help from Albany, Washington and the unions to close more than four-fifths of the $3.4 billion gap it faces in the fiscal year that begins in just three and a half months, on July 1. 
Much of that help, the report said, is unlikely. There has been little headway in negotiations with the unions, and the state and federal governments face their own large deficits.
"Based on the initial response of the city's intended partners, it seems very unlikely that the city will achieve its plan as currently constituted," the report said.
The control board ticked off a list of big-ticket budget items the city is counting on that look doubtful, or at least at risk: nearly $1 billion from a new commuter tax; $600 million in labor savings; $275 million in state aid to pay teachers to work longer days; $252 million in other state aid; $200 million in unspecified transportation initiatives; and $200 million to $250 million in federal money and actions the government might take to save the city money. 
The report noted that future federal tax cuts could drain the city's coffers, since many city taxes are calculated based partly on federal taxes.
The control board urged the city to "refashion its plan to incorporate more readily attainable initiatives." 
Mayor Bloomberg has already begun to change his plans. He recently ordered city agencies to submit $600 million more in possible service cuts, including layoffs if necessary. He initially described the cuts as a backup plan in case the city does not win the $600 million in union concessions it is seeking.
But the mayor now says that with tax collections weakening, the city will have to put the cuts in effect even if the unions agree to the savings.
"Sadly, over the next few weeks, we are likely, when we run our fiscal models that predict tax revenues, to find a forecast 300-odd million dollars lower for fiscal '04 than previous estimates," Mr. Bloomberg said yesterday in a speech to bankers at a luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria. 
"That $300 million will eat up half of the next $600 million in cuts," he continued. "That just underscores the need for efficiencies in our workplace -- which by themselves will not be enough to close the budget gap, but to some extent would mitigate the inevitable layoffs."
The mayor has slightly ratcheted up his language in recent days when commenting on the role of the state and federal governments in the city's budget crisis.
For the second time in a week, Mr. Bloomberg referred to the state's Medicaid program as "taxation without representation," and called on Albany to reduce the city's share of that health care bill.
He also reprised his call for so-called tort reform, which would reduce the amount of legal claims against the city, and for his commuter tax plan. And he complained that the federal formula for distributing money to pay for additional security shortchanges New York, because it does not recognize the additional risks the city faces.
Later, as he announced a new contract for police sergeants with what he vowed would be one of the last contracts his administration awards with raises not offset by productivity savings, the mayor made light of the control board report.
"What the Financial Control Board letter said was, 'You've done all of the things that you have control over, but. . . .' " said Mr. Bloomberg, surrounded by union officials.
"Thank you very much," he added. "I couldn't understand the point of the letter."
The new contract gives sergeants a 10 percent raise and increases health benefits. It expires May 31. The mayor has said he wants to ban retroactive raises in the future.

HEADLINE: Chief Executive Is Leaving A Battered Electronic Data 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
Electronic Data Systems, which has been battered in the last year by earnings shortfalls and questions about its accounting practices, said yesterday that its chief executive, Richard H. Brown, was leaving and would be succeeded by Michael H. Jordan, the retired chairman and chief executive of CBS. 
 E.D.S. also said that Jeffrey M. Heller, a longtime executive who retired a year ago as vice chairman, had returned as president and chief operating officer. The company also said that its annual meeting would be pushed back to May 20 from April 22. 
 The ouster of Mr. Brown, which was made formal at a board meeting yesterday, came after several months of discussion among board members about the direction of the company, which is best known for acquiring and running the computer operations of big businesses or government agencies. 
Mr. Brown, 55, reached a "mutual agreement" to step down after a meeting with four outside directors in Dallas on Wednesday afternoon, according to a director, Roger A. Enrico. Terms of Mr. Brown's severance package were not disclosed.
"It says a lot of good things about Dick Brown that he's handling it this way," said Mr. Enrico, the former vice chairman of PepsiCo.
Mr. Brown is leaving the company stronger than it was when he joined it just over four years ago, Mr. Enrico said, and his resignation demonstrates realism and a "willingness to take responsibility for things that were not necessarily his fault."
But the decision had been essentially made long before Mr. Brown agreed to it. Mr. Jordan, 66, said he was first approached three weeks ago about taking over.
Shares of Electronic Data, which traded at $65.91 a year ago, edged up 6 cents, to $15.76 before the announcement late yesterday. In trading after the announcement, they jumped as high as $17.20.
Mr. Brown's departure ends an eventful chapter in the history of Electronic Data, one of the more colorful technology companies. Based just outside Dallas in Plano, Tex., the company was founded by H. Ross Perot, who aggressively built it into a big competitor to his former employer, I.B.M. Mr. Perot made a fortune but became continuously embroiled in controversy after selling the company to General Motors.
By the time Mr. Brown arrived in 1999, Electronic Data had been divested by G.M. but was steadily losing ground to I.B.M. in a rapidly expanding computer services market. Nor had it successfully integrated A. T. Kearney, the large management consulting firm it had acquired. 
Mr. Brown, who had achieved a reputation for rapidly and successfully shaking up stodgy cultures at H&R Block and then Cable and Wireless of Britain, was attracted to Electronic Data by James A. Baker III, the former secretary of state and an E.D.S. board member. Mr. Baker was also part of the group that secured his resignation Wednesday at a meeting in the offices of Ray L. Hunt, chairman and chief executive of Hunt Oil .
Such an end seemed improbable a year ago. Mr. Brown quickly set about delivering on expectations in 1999. He dismissed more than 5,000 employees, including 20 percent of the sales force, and reorganized the many consulting and service pieces of the company into four global business groups to encourage better teamwork and coordination. He also set up strict performance appraisal systems and linked pay to them.
Profits soared to a record $1.4 billion on revenue of $21.54 billion in 2001. The stock climbed, reaching almost $78 late in 2001. Mr. Brown's compensation also soared, reaching a staggering $52 million and irking some shareholders.
But much of the growth had come from winning multiyear contracts like a $6 billion deal to build an intranet for the Navy and Marine Corps. Such deals required the company to spend heavily on equipment before it could begin recouping cash. When the economy crumbled, so did some of its biggest clients, including WorldCom, United Airlines and US Airways. 
Overconfident that its fortunes would turn, E.D.S. lost $255 million betting that its shares would recover as they continued to fall last year. And it so badly misread the sluggishness of demand for its services that, on Sept. 18, it was forced to tell Wall Street that earnings would be 80 percent lower than projected. Then several new megacontracts fell through, including an expected deal with Procter & Gamble.
The board's concern with the apparent loss of insight into what was actually happening in the business was compounded in October when the Securities and Exchange Commission began an inquiry into the company's accounting. That inquiry was escalated to a formal investigation in January.
Mr. Jordan, who started his career as a consultant at McKinsey & Company and then spent 18 years rising through the ranks, said yesterday that he needed time to become more acquainted with E.D.S. But he said that he was confident he was walking into a far less challenging situation than he faced when he assumed control at Westinghouse Electric in 1993. Unable to save the conglomerate, he sold everything except its media arm and eventually merged that with CBS.
Mr. Jordan said that Electronic Data was a strong company hobbled by a weak economy and tougher competition than it had faced in the past as both customers and competitors became more sophisticated. He said that Mr. Brown had offered to remain involved in any way that Mr. Jordan found helpful and that he expected to consult with him next week. When asked what he wanted from Mr. Brown, Mr. Jordan, adopting the term for the complete transfer of information between mainframe computers, said that he expected "a core dump."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: AIRLINES; 
Carriers, Already Ailing, Cut Flights And Say They May Reduce Jobs or Pay

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
With the start of the second Persian Gulf war, airlines around the world -- already battered by the industry's worst downturn -- cut back even more on their schedules yesterday, especially on flights to the Middle East. Some carriers also said they would have to cut costs by laying off workers or reducing pay.
 Large American companies like Pfizer and Tyson Foods said they had clamped down on employee travel. Many unfazed air travelers took to the skies, though, having expected for days that the American invasion of Iraq could start at any time. But some passengers said they had seriously thought about changing their plans as war appeared imminent. 
 "I would have canceled my trip, but I would have lost my ticket, so I'm going," said Diane Clark, a 55-year-old nurse and missionary who was calmly eating lunch yesterday at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago before flying to Ethiopia. "After listening to the news, I probably would have waited to take this trip."
Ms. Clark said she had paid $1,600 for her ticket on British Airways. 
Airlines said bookings had already fallen sharply compared with those at this time last year. A lawyer for US Airways, which hopes to emerge from bankruptcy protection in 10 days, told a judge yesterday that bookings had dropped by 20 percent in the last week. 
The speed at which traveler confidence returns will depend on the length of the war and whether terrorist attacks occur, executives and industry experts said.
Lufthansa Airlines, the German carrier, suspended service for two days to Kuwait, Tel Aviv and Amman, Jordan. Air France cut a flight to Amman from Paris. KLM, the Dutch carrier, said it was canceling flights between Amsterdam and Kuwait today and Sunday, and two flights to Amman today. It said it would fly to Tel Aviv only in daylight hours.
Singapore Airlines took a more sweeping approach, saying it will cut 65 flights a week from late March to May 31 to cities in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa.
American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, is likely to make changes to its international schedule, said Todd Burke, a company spokesman.
In total, more than a dozen airlines have cut their schedules since Monday night, when President Bush issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq. The opening salvo against Baghdad on Wednesday night sent airline planners back to their computers, scrutinizing where passenger bookings had dipped and which flights could be cut. The International Air Transport Association said bookings would fall about 10 percent now that the war had started.
Industry analysts said airlines in the United States would probably cut capacity by at least 10 percent. United, operating under bankruptcy protection, has said it may have to cut its capacity 10 percent to 12 percent.
Kurt Ebenhoch, a spokesman for Northwest Airlines, said schedule changes were "a matter under study here." Northwest is suspending through Sunday its daily flight from Amsterdam to Bombay.
The carriers took similar actions during the first gulf war in 1991. A half-year passed before capacity returned to prewar levels, said Michael Allen, chief operating officer of Back Aviation Solutions, an airline consulting company based in New Haven.
"What you're going to see is parking of airplanes by each of the Big Six carriers, and they're going to pull down capacity," Mr. Allen said. "They'll also have to make judgments in terms of which markets will be more affected. For example, areas like the trans-Atlantic will be disproportionately affected because there will be more concern in that area."
In February 1991, during the first gulf war, trans-Atlantic traffic plummeted 44 percent from the month a year earlier, and travel across the Pacific fell 21 percent, according to the Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group in this country.
The drop is likely to be less this time because the weak economy has already slowed travel for nearly three years and because travelers are relatively inured to the threat of a terrorist strike after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.
With the price of crude oil in sharp fluctuation, almost all the big carriers have hedged their fuel costs, though to varying degrees. Southwest Airlines has hedged all of its fuel costs this quarter, with 85 percent capped at $23 a barrel for oil. American has 40 percent hedged, and United none, according to a recent report from Susan Donofrio, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.
The major American carriers could lose up to $10.7 billion this year and be forced to cut 70,000 jobs if there is a prolonged war, the Air Transport Association said.
US Airways said in bankruptcy court yesterday morning that it might have to impose a 5 percent wage deferral on its workers now that the war had begun.
The company's lead lawyer, John W. Butler Jr., said the airline might also have to reduce its fleet below the minimum level of 279 planes mandated by its contract with the Air Line Pilots Association. To make those cuts, US Airways would have to invoke the so-called force majeure clause of the contract, which gives the company leeway to enact drastic operational changes to cope with a war, terrorist attacks or acts of God.
Mr. Butler also said that US Airways would miss a $27 million lease payment today on Airbus planes and that it had reached an impasse in negotiations with the pilots' union over pension obligations. The airline will not be able to emerge from bankruptcy protection until it resolves those obligations.
Air Canada said yesterday that it would cut 3,600 jobs by the end of the year. On Wednesday, Continental Airlines said it was eliminating 1,200 jobs, perhaps the prelude to a wave of layoffs among the main United States carriers.
At many large airports, police officers and security guards conducted random searches of arriving cars. Some passengers stared as teams of guards marched through the terminals with a sense of purpose not seen since the days after the Sept. 11 attacks. Signs had been put up overnight warning travelers to expect heightened security measures.
At New Orleans International Airport, a group of 35 clean-cut young men dressed in red, white and blue windbreakers stood restlessly in line at a United Airlines counter. The young men, baseball players from the University of Illinois at Chicago, were on their way home after playing in Louisiana. Their coach, Mike Dee, said they might start traveling more by bus if flying proved perilous in the weeks to come. 
"I think any time you're in charge of 35 people, particularly young people, sure you're concerned," he said. "You'd hate to have people afraid to do what's normal, but we certainly learned two years ago that things do change."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: PETROLEUM; 
Nervous Day in the Pit For Traders of Crude

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
When the opening buzzer rang at 10 a.m. yesterday at the New York Mercantile Exchange, the high walls of the exchange, with their news tickers and electronic price boards, flashed like a casino. But the hundreds of men and the few women on the cavernous trading floor fell silent.
 Normally the room would have exploded with the deafening buying and selling of oil, among other precious commodities. But on this day, phone calls from clients went unanswered. Even after a buzzer squawked again two minutes later to signal the end of the period of silence, no one moved. 
 "No one wanted to be the first to open their mouths," said Vincent Lanci, who trades crude oil for his own company, Berard Capital. "It went beyond what was expected. Traders identify with the troops in the Persian Gulf. Many, many people here lost people in the World Trade Center. The feeling here is whether you're for or against the war, everyone now is a patriot." 
Those first minutes would provide the only lull in a wild trading day, when the price of oil and the anxieties of oil traders on the floor rose and fell with the news from the Persian Gulf. Reports of well fires in Iraq drove up crude oil prices, but the start of full-scale bombing later in the afternoon brought them down. 
"The mood on the floor is very nervous," said Anthony Moschitto, who trades oil for his own account. "It's hard to even trade when your country is at war."
Few places of business seem so tightly bound to what happens in the world as the mercantile exchange. Fewer still engage in commerce that has such a great influence on the world economy as a place that trades oil.
To look at it, the whole operation seems utterly incomprehensible. Men wearing brightly colored jackets stand shoulder to shoulder in round, sunken pits, screaming and waving their hands at each other in what seems the nastiest family argument ever. They make hand signals as cryptic as those of any third base coach. Periodically, they fling white note cards into the center of the pit with great accuracy. 
But every day, out of this apparent chaos, the benchmark prices of crude oil and other crucial energy commodities are set.
On Wednesday, oil closed just below $30 a barrel. But in electronic trading overnight, the price fell about $2, because traders thought the Tomahawk missile strikes on Baghdad had killed Saddam Hussein and his captains, said Eric Bolling, an oil trader and member of the exchange's board. 
When traders at the mercantile exchange finally got past their emotions to begin trading yesterday morning, prices inched up. Television news programs were broadcasting a videotape of an apparently unharmed Mr. Hussein, followed by reports that Iraq had launched missiles against Kuwait. By 11:30 a.m., the Pentagon had confirmed that several oil wells in Iraq were on fire, news that drove the price above Wednesday's close.
The swings, while substantial, were not as huge as they had been in previous weeks, traders noted. Much of the war premium was drained from the price of oil earlier this week, when President Bush made it clear that war was imminent. Markets hate uncertainty -- and most traders and their clients think that the war will be swift and relatively painless for all sides -- so they welcomed the clarity by selling.
"The price action is volatile, but the sentiment is, We've seen this before on the way up and the way down," Mr. Bolling said. "A lot of the guys here were here in '91," during the first Persian Gulf war.
Some traders viewed the sanguineness as premature, of course. And no one expected the price of oil to fall as low as it did when the bombing started in January 1991 -- that is, below $20 a barrel.
"The template is the last war," said William Wallace, who runs trading floor operations for Man Financial, an energy brokerage firm. "People have a tendency to think history might repeat itself, and they tend toward the optimistic. Last time, things went incredibly well. But wars aren't clean things."
Given what they consider the fundamentals of the market, many traders said they expected the price of oil to settle at $25 to $32 during -- and perhaps after -- the war. Independent of the fighting, they noted, stockpiles of crude oil and gasoline in the United States are lower than they have been in many years, at a time when the nation is normally laying in supplies for the prime driving season of late spring and summer. 
The price of oil could fall sharply if the Bush administration released oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, traders said. But Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham reiterated yesterday that the administration would do so only in the case of a severe disruption of oil supplies. 
A disruption would be hundreds of Iraqi wells set ablaze, traders said, or successful attacks -- by Iraq or terrorists -- against oil installations in Kuwait or Saudi Arabia. "Or there could be no news," Mr. Lanci of Berard Capital said. "No news of victories. That would mean that the war isn't over. The longer the war goes on, the more nervous people get, and that would be bullish for prices."
In the late hours of trading yesterday, oil prices fell sharply, as news of American bombs falling on Iraq reached the exchange floor. Traders glanced at large flat-screen monitors near the trading pits that showed images of jets taking off from aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf and bright flashes of light puncturing the evening sky over Baghdad. By 1:40 p.m., the price of oil was down to $28.40. 
Faith had been renewed amid the shouting. "A few oil well fires can be put out," said Richard Schaeffer, director of global futures at ABN Amro. "Everybody is convinced the war was over before it started. I personally think this could be a three- or four-day bombing extravaganza, followed by three to four weeks of annoying dogfights."
At 2 p.m., a buzzer sounded to indicate that a half-hour of trading remained, and the traders summoned the energy to build to a louder, faster gradation of mayhem.
And then, at 2:30 p.m., the final buzzer sounded. "That's all," said a man on a raised podium, as note cards fell to the floor, the traders' fluttering arms dropped to their sides and April crude oil futures, which expired at the end of the session, settled at $28.61. "That's all. That's all."

A Wartime Economy
The start of the war with Iraq removed some of the uncertainty taxing the United States economy, even as it created disruptions for businesses and the potential for costly long-term problems.
 Many stores and restaurants were emptier than usual yesterday. Some people stayed home or in their offices to watch television news and others who live in big cities avoided public places because of terrorism worries.
 But most executives and economists expected the decline in sales to be only temporary, as it was during the first Persian Gulf war and the days just after Sept. 11, 2001. Predicting that the United States would win the war quickly, executives said the start of fighting was a first step toward clarifying the direction of the economy this year.
 In Europe, officials debated how the war might affect their economies, with some experts noting that France and Germany could end up benefiting most from the conflict they opposed, while Asia has been feeling the ill effects of the crisis in Iraq for months.
 In the United States, stocks edged higher yesterday, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closing at 875.84, up 1.82 points. The index, after falling for much of this year, has nearly returned to the level it reached at the end of 2002.
 Still, the economy was not functioning normally yesterday.
 Car dealerships and real estate agencies reported fewer customers than usual. Sales of bottled water, canned meat and propane stoves remained high at Wal-Mart, the company said. Some businesses have hired more guards in recent days, adding to security budgets that had already risen sharply.
 Airlines in the United States and elsewhere cut back on flights, particularly to the Middle East, and executives of some struggling carriers were discussing whether to ask their workers for new salary reductions.

HEADLINE: After War, Let Iraqis Triumph 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF; On the Ground, an interactive feature by Mr. Kristof, is online at nytimes.com/pages/opinion. E-mail: nicholas@nytimes.com

DATELINE: KUWAIT 

 BODY:
In Kuwait these days, the nice hotels supply mints on the pillows, and also terrifying brochures entitled "Preventive Measures in Case of Potential Attack Using Chemical Weapons."
 The government press center serves French pastries as air raid sirens blare warnings about incoming missiles. U.S. Army officers sit at laptops in the air-conditioned luxury of the Hilton hotel, gas masks dangling at their sides. 
 Those are the eerie and disturbing mismatches here in Kuwait as war begins, and with missiles flying and American troops in danger, it's natural to focus on the immediate battle. But the biggest mistake we made 12 years ago in the first gulf war was not a military one on the battlefield, but rather a broader political one: we failed to look ahead and plan adequately what we would do the day after we won. This time, even more than before, we urgently need to plan the peace. 
That's also an opportunity for us all to move beyond our own fratricidal debate about the war. Those of us who have opposed this war need to recognize that we lost the debate, not only in the halls of the White House but also in the court of public opinion as well. It's time to move on.
We all share President Bush's hope that ousting Saddam will transform Iraq into a flourishing democracy and revive the Middle East. Here are two principles that may help us improve the chances of winning the peace in Iraq:
First, make this an Arab victory.
As the Pakistani scholar Hussain Haqqani has noted, there's a flaw in the idea that invading Iraq will lead to a new Arab dawn: for the last 700 years, Muslims have reacted to defeat not by embracing modernism but by turning inward and grasping religious fundamentalism. On the other hand, the greatest reform in any Muslim country in the last century came in Turkey after a rare victory, when Kemal Ataturk defeated the Greeks and foiled Western plans to carve up his country.
The U.S. plans to make Jay Garner, a retired general, the civilian viceroy of Iraq. But every invasion in the Middle East in the last two centuries, since Napoleon's, has soured within a few years, in part because of nationalist resentment of the intruders. 
That suggests that we should make the outcome in Iraq seem, as much as possible, like a victory for Iraqis, and we should put them in charge quickly. There is a way to engineer this: Shiites make up about 60 percent of Iraqis but have historically been politically repressed and economically impoverished, so if we allow them their fair share of power, this will be a genuine and historic triumph for them. 
Second, don't mess with Iraq's oil. Iraq is, economically, a disaster, with Unicef reporting that 25 percent of children are chronically malnourished, and estimates of the cost of rebuilding the country running to $100 billion or more. Just restoring Iraq's electrical grid to its pre-1990 level may cost $20 billion. 
Some have suggested brightly that Iraqi oil will pay for rebuilding the country. It won't. Iraqi oil production capacity has been falling in recent years, not rising, and it will be expensive to turn that around. A report this month from the Council on Foreign Relations estimated that restoring production to its peak in 1977 -- 3.5 million barrels per day, compared with a capacity today of 2.8 million barrels per day -- would require spending $6 billion over two years.
Everywhere I have been in the Arab world over the last year, people have been deeply cynical about American motives, assuming that we're just after Iraqi oil. Unless we want to give anti-Americanism a huge boost and create tremendous hostility within Iraq that would make our occupation untenable, we won't covet Iraq's oil -- it's just not worth it. Having harmed America's image in the runup to this war, let's restore it in the aftermath.
Oh, no, time to go. The air raid siren is shrieking again, and hotel employees in dark suits and matching gas masks are rushing unnerved guests into a bomb shelter. Kuwait has become a collection of surreal juxtapositions: a rich city of gleaming office towers where people fumble for their gas masks. I have a new mask that allows me to attach a canteen and sip water during a nerve gas attack, but even it is not perfect. It won't accommodate my hotel mint.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: WORLD REACTION; 
Wave of Protests, From Europe to New York

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 20 

 BODY:
Leaders and protesters around the world today condemned the start of war in Iraq, with President Jacques Chirac of France warning that it "will be fraught with consequences for the future." 
 In Russia, President Vladimir V. Putin called for an immediate halt to the American-led assault, saying, "This military action cannot be justified in any way." 
 Regardless of whether their governments supported or opposed the war, hundreds of thousands massed at protests across Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Britain. In Berlin, an estimated 40,000 demonstrators streamed past the United States Embassy and through the Brandenburg Gate, waving banners that read, "Stop the Bush Fire" and "George W. Hitler." 
In the United States, the antiwar demonstrations were generally smaller, but thousands descended on military bases or blocked roads and bridges to voice their opposition. Chanting "Peace Now," some 5,000 people demonstrated in Times Square in New York. 
The wave of global protest began even as the first missiles were hitting Baghdad, with tens of thousands in Melbourne, Australia's second city, bringing traffic to a standstill. In the Middle East, demonstrations were scattered -- a crowd of only 1,000 in Cairo, for instance -- but more vociferous protests were expected on Friday, the day of Muslim worship.
In France, the American Embassy and consulate buildings, just off the Place de la Concorde in Paris, were heavily guarded as tens of thousands of demonstrators assembled, chanting antiwar slogans. The National Assembly briefly suspended its session in symbolic protest.
In Madrid, about 40,000 people packed the Puerta del Sol tonight in protest at the Spanish government's support for President Bush. Fliers that called for a boycott of American consumer goods passed through the crowd.
"At least we can show the world that our government does not represent us," said Javier Velazquez, an economics professor. "It is important to have a European response to a country that just does anything it wants, which is the United States."
American flags were burned outside the embassy in Athens, where an estimated 80,000 demonstrators, mainly students and labor activists, marched peacefully, chanting anti-American slogans.
Sentiment ran generally high against the United States. Fans in Montreal booed loudly tonight when "The Star-Spangled Banner" was sung before the Canadiens' game against the New York Islanders.
Appearing on national television this morning, Mr. Chirac reiterated France's opposition to the war and said he regretted it was "initiated without United Nations backing."
While emphasizing that France was supported by many other nations, he added an appeal for the world and especially Europe toreunite in pursuit of common goals.
"Tomorrow, we shall have to meet again, with our allies, with the whole international community, to take up together the challenges awaiting us," he said. "Europe must realize the need to express its own vision of world problems and support this vision with a credible common defense."
Mr. Chirac spoke before attending a previously scheduled summit meeting of the leaders from the 15 European Union nations in Brussels, where an attempt was made to paper over the continent's deep rifts with a common statement on how best to secure peace after the war in Iraq.
Also attending the summit meeting was Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Mr. Bush's staunchest ally. Before leaving for Brussels, Mr. Blair recorded a five-minute speech that was broadcast in Britain at 10 p.m., formally acknowledging that British troops are now at war.
"I know this course of action has produced deep divisions of opinion in our country," said Mr. Blair, who has faced strong popular protest and a revolt in his Labor Party. "But this new world faces a new threat: of disorder and chaos born either of brutal states like Iraq, armed with weapons of mass destruction, or of extreme terrorist groups. Both hate our way of life, our freedom, our democracy."
Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, who has also backed Mr. Bush, sent only a hospital ship and 900 personnel to the Persian Gulf. He told his country: "We have assumed our responsibilities. There were more comfortable options, but we don't want to pass on to the future risks that we should confront in the present."
Yet here and there, even among leaders critical of the war, a sense of resignation -- and a desire to begin healing divisions -- were evident.
In Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said on television that "the wrong decision was taken." Yet he added, "The differences over the war are clear differences of opinion among governments, not deep-seated differences between friendly peoples."
The New China news agency reported that the former Chinese foreign minister, Tang Jiaxuan, in a telephone call with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, appealed for an end to military operations, "so that the Iraq issue can be returned to the current track of a political solution."
In Russia, Mr. Putin called the war a "big political mistake."
Mr. Putin, a staunch defender of Russia's sovereignty over the rebel region of Chechnya, said, "If we allow international law to be replaced by the law of the first, in which the strong is always right, and has the right to do anything, then one of the most basic principles of international law will come into question: the inviolability of state sovereignty." 
Yet this evening, Russia's foreign minister, Igor S. Ivanov, told reporters that Russia and America "remain partners, not opponents, despite the war in Iraq."
In Canada, Prime Minister Jean Chretien sought to smooth relations with Washington, saying, "We must do nothing to comfort Saddam Hussein."
"We hope it will be brief, with a minimum of casualties on both sides," Mr. Chretien said of the war.
In the Pacific, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, all close allies of the United States, expressed support.
Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, despite widespread opposition to the war in Japan, said Baghdad had "not acted sincerely."
The Philippine president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, said her country was "part of the coalition of the willing."
But Malaysia and Indonesia, Muslim nations, condemned the war.
Severe condemnation of the war came from the papacy and theleaders of other religions.
In Rome, the papal spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said Pope John Paul II was "deeply pained." In a statement, he deplored the fact that Baghdad "did not accept the resolutions of the United Nations and the appeal by the pope himself, which asked for the country to disarm." But he also criticized the rupture of negotiations toward peaceful disarmament.
The papal displeasure was echoed in denunciations of the war from leaders of Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant and Muslim groups.
In South America, official reaction of the six governments making up the Mercosur group, led by Brazil, was uniformly negative. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil condemned the American position as an act of "disrespect to the United Nations and the rest of the world." 
"All of us want for Iraq not to have atomic weapons or weapons of mass destruction," he said, "but that does not give the United States the right to decide by itself what is good and what is bad for the world."

HEADLINE: A Nation at War 

 BODY:
 The Attacks on Iraq

STRIKE ON HUSSEIN -- Officials were still holding out hope that one of the American 2,000-pound bombs and nearly 40 Tomahawk cruise missiles, each carrying 1,000 pounds of explosives, may have struck Saddam Hussein or one of his sons, but officials say it may take days to discover the results of the attacks. A1

CHEMICAL WARFARE -- Iraq's ability to wage chemical and biological warfare against the American and British forces depends both on the agents it may have prepared and on the available means of delivering them. Iraq is thought to possess nerve agents: sarin and VX, as well as large quantities of mustard gas. On the biological side, it has had anthrax, botulinum toxin and aflatoxin, according to reports by United Nations inspectors. B5

NORTH IRAQ -- As war to oust Mr.Hussein from power began, the military power aligned against him in northern Iraq was almost nonexistent, a tiny showing of poorly equipped indigenous gunmen sitting opposite a large Iraqi force. B7

IRAQI OPINION -- Many Iraqis expressed doubt that there would be any immediate uprising in the south to accompany an invasion while both ordinary refugees and the organized opposition groups that have offices in Iraq said they feared heavy civilian casualties in Iraqi cities as government officials try to hide among civilians. B8

Plans and Strategies

THEN AND NOW -- The swift land assault by lead elements of Marines, Army and British forces was different from the 1991 Gulf war in an important way: the degree of risk. When the U.S. military began ground attacks in 1991 it had a much larger force and a more limited objective: evicting the Iraqi forces from Kuwait. This time the force is smaller and Mr. Hussein has his back against the wall. B1

FIRST CASUALTIES -- American soldiers crossed a wide swath of the border between Kuwait and Iraq in what commanders called an efficient, successful operation. While there were no American casualties, three Iraqis died in one attack, the first confirmed casualties of the Army's campaign. A1

FIRST STRIKE -- Weeks of published Pentagon briefings that had forecast an awesome aerial onslaught as the opening phase of the conflict, with as many as 3,000 cruise missiles to be launched in the first 48 hours, had prepared the Iraqi leadership for punishment far more severe than the first two American attacks on the capital. Four soldiers and one civilian were killed in the combined attacks, according to an Iraqi government statement. A1

TALK OF DEFECTION -- Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said that allied officials have held secret talks with members of Iraq's elite Republican Guard and Special Republican Guard about defecting or surrendering and that he was encouraged by signs that the threat of an all-out American attack was prompting many Iraqi military units and their commanders to consider a cease-fire or give up. A1

Voices of Dissent

GLOBAL PROTEST -- Leaders and protesters around the world condemned the start of war in Iraq, with President Jacques Chirac warning that it "will be fraught with consequences for the future," and President Vladimir V. Putin calling for an immediate halt to the assault. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of protesters massed at several protests across Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Britain with smaller demonstrations in Melbourne, New York and across the Middle East. A1

APPEALS FROM THE MIDEAST -- Edgy Arab nations weathered the first day of the American war against Iraq with protests, appeals to the Bush administration to stop the bombing and condemnation of Saddam Hussein. B9

DISCONTENT AT HOME -- Antiwar protesters in the United States honored their pledge to "stop business as usual" the day after bombing began in Iraq, walking out of classes and work, shutting down major roads and converging on plazas, bridges, military bases and federal buildings to proclaim their opposition to war. B4

The View Outside Iraq

TURKEY OFFERS AIRSPACE -- With the American-led assault under way, the Turkish Parliament voted to open Turkish airspace to American military planes bound for Iraq and to authorize Turkish troops to enter Iraq if the Turkish government deemed it necessary. B2

EUROPEAN SUMMIT -- The 15 leaders of the European Union attended a quarterly summit meeting and issued a statement of solidarity on the way to secure the peace and called on the Security Council to give the United Nations a "strong mandate" in the reconstruction of Iraq. B2

ON THE BORDER -- Jordan, a country where more than half the population of five million is Palestinian, is officially opposed to the war but as an American ally, however, the counry has allowed several thousand United States Special Forces into its eastern border with Iraq and is preparing to shelter refugees after being flooded by over a million during the first Gulf war. B8

THE STATE OF ISRAEL -- The war in Iraq gave Israelis and Palestinians a new forum for expressing their sharp political differences, but there was no surge in violence to accompany the onset of hostilities. Israelis overwhelmingly support the United States, while the Palestinians oppose the war in equal numbers, with some cheering the Iraqi leader for his willingness to confront the Americans. B9

The Home Front

ON ALERT -- Federal law enforcement officials warned of new intelligence suggesting the possibility of terrorist attacks linked to an American attack on Iraq and said the F.B.I. was searching for a Qaeda suspect who received flight training in the United States. They also disclosed that National Guard troops had been dispatched to the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station near Phoenix as a result of reports that Al Qaeda or its sympathizers might be planning an attack. B10

IN NEW YORK -- New York had been anticipating the American-led attack on Iraq, but when the war came, it altered the rhythms and routines of life in the city in many ways -- some easily definable, some less so. And as New Yorkers noticed the new differences, there was also a sense that the price of war would be high for a city still recovering from the attacks of Sept. 11. B10

PATROLLING THE HARBOR -- With the country at war and on high alert, the New York Police Department's harbor unit has turned its focus from stopping intoxicated day sailors and reckless jet skiers to engaging in caffeine-fueled watches for suspicious-looking boats during 12-hour days without days off, standing deck watch with machine guns and night-vision binoculars, scouring bridges, tunnels, power plants and hospitals. B10

IRAQIS IN AMERICA -- F.B.I. and police officials announced plans to interview 397 Iraqis identified as living in Western Pennsylvania in return for a pledge by F.B.I. officials to protect American Muslims and their mosques from the type of hate crimes and bias attacks that both sides expect now that the United States is at war with a predominantly Muslim nation. B11

GOING TO WAR -- The first day of the attack on Iraq unfolded as a mundane Thursday in much of the nation, as people struggled to balance celebrating the first signs of spring with a nagging sense that the mood should be somber. Even as the war's debut disrupted some business, economists were relieved to finally be free of the uncertainty that has been delaying the recovery. B11

The View From Home

ON THE SCREEN -- The first full day of television coverage of the invasion of Iraq revealed a firestorm of amazing combat images. By agreeing to give hundreds of journalists unprecedented access, the Pentagon hoped to get reporters and viewers rooting for the visiting team on the first day out -- and build goodwill for any rainy PR days ahead. B11

WATCHING THE WAR -- On the opening night of the war, when every other television news organization enjoyed substantial ratings gains, ABC News had a disastrous evening when it left dozens of affiliates with a black screen and without news coverage. B11

HEADLINE: Innocents In Uniform 

BYLINE:  By Uwe E. Reinhardt; Uwe E. Reinhardt is a professor of political economy at Princeton University.

DATELINE: PRINCETON N.J. 

 BODY:
CNN recently showed a Marine chaplain admonishing the platoon assembled before him: Pray not only for yourself, he told them, but for your enemies as well. After all, they are just soldiers, like you, doing what they are ordered to do.
 What a refreshing departure these words were from what I've been hearing from the civilian sector, where the talk is mainly of minimizing coalition casualties or, in more generous moments, innocent Iraqi civilian casualties as well. I wince every time I hear that kind of talk, especially the reference to innocence. Should not the proper minimum in any war be loss of human life, period -- which in this case includes Iraqi soldiers, too? 
 My earliest childhood memories were forged by war -- real war. My family lived near one of the most ferocious battle grounds of the European war theater -- the notorious Hurtgen forest, where American and German soldiers fought one another in hand-to-hand combat for more than four months in the fall of 1944. A plaque at one of the military cemeteries in the area notes that more American soldiers died there than in Vietnam, and surely as many or more German soldiers were killed there too. 
My family lived opposite a convent that had been converted into a field hospital for the nearby front. I was a small boy then, and watching the ambulances come and go (sometimes peeking curiously into them), I could not help but become witness daily to the horrors of war. Millions of Europeans of my generation, whom many Americans now disparage so contemptuously as pacifists, had a similar experience.
Because we lived so near the Battle of the Bulge and the advancing allied forces, our village was strafed and bombed routinely. One such attack came as my friends and I were playing outside. We ran as the planes approached, taking shelter in the cavernous basement of the convent. There we spied a row of stretchers. On each was a body covered entirely by a blanket. Possibly to overcome our own terror, we dared one another to pull back a blanket on one of the stretchers, to see what a dead man looked like. Someone did. We fell silent instantly as we beheld the serene, waxen face of a very young soldier who could not have been older than 16 or 17.
More than 50 years later, I can still see his face clearly. The shock of it recurs whenever I hear the chirpy anchors on the morning programs (not to mention the hawkish talking heads) prattle on about innocent civilians, as if the number of fallen enemy soldiers did not count. What does "innocent" mean in the context of war?
I am almost certain that the young German soldier my friends and I saw so many years ago in that convent basement was as innocent as those of us who weren't in uniform. For all we know, he had grown up on a farm somewhere and, while fighting in the trenches, dreamed of his girlfriend and of life as an adult in peaceful times. For all we know, he would have happily quit fighting and joined the allies. (He didn't have much of a choice: some German generals strung up on trees the bodies of young soldiers who had deserted, a powerful warning to their peers.) 
Perhaps many of the Iraqi soldiers, too, find themselves where they are because they have no other choice. After all, is not Saddam Hussein a ruthless dictator, and are not some of his generals likely to be as cruel as their Wehrmacht counterparts?
My hope is that Americans can muster the proper decorum that an enterprise as horrible as war demands. There is nothing neat about maiming and killing people with precision bombs from the air or gunfire on the ground -- even if they're wearing enemy uniforms. Young lives are snuffed out; parents, siblings and lovers weep, and so should we. We want our troops to win a quick victory, to be sure. As the father of a young Marine officer on the front lines in Iraq, I certainly do. But let us heed that Marine chaplain who, like anyone who has ever witnessed war, knows whereof he speaks. Let us hope and pray for a minimum loss of human life -- period.

HEADLINE: Making the World Safe for Hypocrisy 

BYLINE:  By Edward C. Luck; Edward C. Luck is director of the Center on International Organization at Columbia University.

 BODY:
The eerie whine of precision-guided missiles over Baghdad contrasts with the equally shrill but increasingly muddled debate over the legality of the conflict. The trans-Atlantic war of words has laid bare competing visions of the purpose of the United Nations Security Council. Was the council meant just to pass judgment on the use of force -- or to organize its collective use? Given the imbalance of power between the United States and the rest of the world, should it embrace American military might -- or seek to constrain it?
 Unless these contradictions are reconciled, the council will be relegated to dealing with local crises, as in East Timor and Sierra Leone. The United Nations will retain operational roles in peacekeeping, mediation, humanitarian relief, human rights, development and nation-building. But if lesser powers contrive to turn the council into a forum for counterbalancing American power with votes, words and public appeals, they will further erode its legitimacy and credibility. Given the experience of the League of Nations, the architects of the United Nations were determined to bind American power and global decision-making, not to set them at odds. 
 The United Nations, sadly, has drifted far from its founding vision. Its Charter neither calls for a democratic council nor relegates the collective use of force to a last resort. It was a wartime document of a military alliance, not a universal peace platform. Pleas for reform of the Security Council, however, stress equity and representation -- not effectiveness and responsibility. The reformers would mimic the political correctness and practical impotence of the League's Council. Then, as now, most states had little stomach for enforcement.
It wasn't supposed to be this way. By combining muscle and legal authority, Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter promised to set the United Nations apart from the feckless League. Yet, as France, Russia and China looked the other way, Saddam Hussein stripped the United Nations Security Council of its credibility layer by layer.
Last September, President Bush ungallantly pointed out that the council, like the proverbial emperor, has no clothes. However weak his multilateral credentials, on this he is right: the council has shed credibility for so long that more worldly leaders have forgotten what it looks like. His warnings about the United Nations morphing back into the League of Nations have fallen on deaf ears in capitals that would prefer a weak council to a strong one dominated by the United States. They are as ambivalent about American power as Washington is about international organization.
Reforming the Security Council is inconceivable without a reconciliation among the major powers. Paris and Berlin should understand that neither European unity nor global leadership can be built on a platform of denial and demonstrations. Neither Paris nor London is about to cede its permanent seat to the European Union, and intra-European bickering has been a major obstacle to Security Council reform.
For its part, the Bush administration should do more listening and less preaching. Most countries are neither friends nor foes, and none likes to be taken for granted. If Washington shows more respect for the agendas of others, they are more likely to respond to ours.
As long as the United States has more military and economic power than any other country, the voting rules in the Security Council will appear arbitrary. Under such conditions, the council should vote less and seek consensus more, giving rogue states less opportunity for employing splitting tactics. Projecting a positive vision, the United Nations Charter speaks of concurring votes of the permanent members, not of their vetoes. The Big Five -- the United States, Britain, France, Russia and China -- were meant to seek common ground, not to deny the validity of one another's security concerns or to posture for public approval.
Since the United Nations no longer tries to organize or oversee the use of force itself, this has been left largely to the discretion of member states. Even Secretary General Kofi Annan has acknowledged that unilateral military action is sometimes necessary. The forced removals of Idi Amin in Uganda, or the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, were justified "in the eyes of the world" because of "the internal character of the regimes," he said in June 1998. Likewise, the council did not authorize the use of force by the West in Kosovo, the United States in Afghanistan, Russia in Chechnya, or, most recently, France in Ivory Coast.
Opponents of the war in Iraq have been highly selective in their reading of the United Nations Charter. It is a compact by which the member states accept constraints on their use of force in the context of a binding system of collective security. Those who for years have sought to weaken the sanctions and inspections efforts in Iraq -- undermining this compact -- have set the stage for the use of force. It is hypocritical for them now to claim that the rest of the Charter's rules are sacrosanct.
Unless both the enforcement and legal pillars of the Charter are reinforced, what is left will indeed look a lot like the ill-fated League of Nations. Will the real United Nations please stand up?

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
European Union Economic Meeting Reports Limited Progress

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, March 21 

 BODY:
Heads of state from the 15 member nations of the European Union made only limited progress on plans to re-energize the faltering European economy at their two-day meeting here, overshadowed by the war in Iraq.
 The leaders said today in a joint statement that the war would make it more difficult for the union to achieve the goal they set at a similar conference in Lisbon three years ago: creating the world's most competitive economy by 2010. They reiterated that goal today and said a revamping of labor markets was their top economic priority. 
 In Lisbon the union set a target of 20 million new jobs by 2010. The leaders said today that "far-reaching structural reform" aimed at raising productivity will be needed to achieve that.
The leaders called on the European Commission, the union's executive body, to set up an employment task force led by the former Dutch prime minister, Wim Kok, to study measures to improve both the quantity and the quality of jobs in the union. They repeated a pledge to make it easier for companies to hire and fire.
The 15 heads of state agreed to move ahead quickly with plans to negotiate a single unionwide aviation treaty with the United States to replace individual bilateral deals, a move that the commission has said will help the ailing airline industry by allowing more cross-border mergers and competition. 
But the leaders made no progress on the proposed package of new tax rules meant to reduce market distortions, including a long-disputed measure that would phase out bank secrecy and would tax foreigners' savings accounts to reduce tax evasion. The last details of the plan were supposed to be ironed out by the 15 nations' finance ministers on the eve of the meeting. But Italy blocked the agreement as part of a drive to get more favorable treatment for its dairy farmers in an unrelated debate about milk quotas. 
"The ministers wasted 40 minutes talking about tax, while more pressing matters were at hand," said one diplomat who attended the meetings. "This illustrates an embarrassing weakness in the European decision-making process."
The heads of state also failed to make any progress on the Galileo navigational satellite project, the union's ambitious plan to build a rival to the Global Positioning System network of the United States. Italy and Germany both want to be home to the Galileo project, and the union has yet to agree on how to share out the project's budget.
But a breakthrough was achieved in the union's six-year effort to harmonize energy taxes across the union and to cut carbon dioxide emissions. 
The finance ministers, meeting in the wings at the conference of heads of state on Thursday, settled on a law meant to increase minimum excise duties on fuel by about 20 percent and to extend energy taxes to electricity, coal and natural gas for the first time.
But environmental groups said the effect of the law will be minimal because most member nations already impose energy taxes well above the proposed new minimums.

HEADLINE: Marching Forward 

BYLINE:  By David Callahan; David Callahan is director of research at Demos, a public policy organization.

 BODY:
Today there will be another rally for peace in Manhattan. In the last few months, the United States has seen the emergence of the largest antiwar movement since the days of Vietnam. Yet the protests had no evident impact on the Bush administration's plans for war in Iraq, which began Wednesday.
 The movement could still influence the direction of United States foreign policy by signaling the profound unease that many Americans feel about a militarized, unilateral approach to the world. It may be, however, that the greater significance of the protests lies in what they portend for politics here at home. While antiwar movements are rarely successful in their immediate goal, they are often prescient indicators of the national mood. 
 Historically, antiwar movements have nearly always put forth larger critiques of how American society is organized, and have often been entwined with powerful social movements focused on domestic problems. Protesters against the Mexican-American War of 1846, worried that it would add more slave-holding states to the Union, energized the abolitionist movement. At the turn of the century, many critics of the imperialistic Spanish-American War were also leaders in a growing push to curb the power of corporate trusts.
Likewise, the intense opposition among many Progressive leaders to America's entry into World War I was wrapped up in domestic considerations. These leaders -- the predecessors of New Deal liberals -- argued that initiatives to create greater social and economic equity should take precedence over involvement in a European war. In the 1960's, the movement against the Vietnam War was linked to a range of national reform efforts, including demands for more civil rights and less poverty. The protests also helped create a counterculture of nonconformity that reshaped American society.
What might today's antiwar movement say about domestic politics? Two undercurrents of the protests hint at larger critiques of United States society that seem to be gaining momentum. One relates to consumption, the other to democracy.
Recent years have seen mounting public uneasiness with the relentless consumption and waste in America. This uneasiness fuels new and different kinds of environmental activism, like campaigns against suburban sprawl or S.U.V.'s. It also underlies the growing movement of "downshifting," which emphasizes simplicity and authenticity over earning and spending.
So when antiwar protesters chant about oil, it should come as no surprise. They are questioning not just the huge United States military presence in the Persian Gulf; they are also criticizing a wasteful American way of life. This critique of our society existed before the war against Iraq, and it will become only more pronounced afterward.
A larger message about the health of American democracy can also be heard amid the din of disparate antiwar arguments. Many protesters are unhappy that their arguments are being ignored -- not so much by the news media, although coverage has been sporadic at best, but by their elected leaders. Of course, a disconnect between the will of ordinary people and elites in Washington has been obvious for more than a decade. It has spurred many third-party candidacies and led to campaign-finance reform. Now, after the manipulation of public opinion by a president intent on war, and the failure of Congress to offer real dissent to his policy, voters' concerns about the health of American democracy will only deepen.
None of these undercurrents is likely to transform American politics any time soon. But elected leaders should understand that the direction of American foreign policy and the fate of Iraq are not the only things protesters are concerned about. They are also worried about the fate of America -- and if history is any guide, their voices will only get louder.

HEADLINE: Lockout at a Truck Plant Enters Seventh Month, and Workers Feel the Pinch 

BYLINE:  BySTEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: MADISON, Tenn., March 20 

 BODY:
Week after week, Linda Wilmoth and hundreds of other workers have taken turns picketing outside the truck factory just north of Old Hickory Boulevard, burning cords of wood through a brutal winter. 
 The workers are delighted about the arrival of spring, but they continue to rage against their company, Peterbilt Motors, which locked them out right after Labor Day, warning that it would not let them return to work until they accepted management's contract offer. 
 "You had 750 workers who wanted to work on Sept. 3, and we had the gate locked in our faces," said Ms. Wilmoth, who installs electrical wiring in the big rigs at the plant just outside of Nashville. "It's very disappointing when you see a company the size of Peterbilt that makes the profits it makes, and then it can just lock the door." 
Last September, union leaders refused Peterbilt's offer, which included annual raises of less than 2 percent, largely because it sought several givebacks on health insurance. Upset that union leaders would not let the workers vote on management's offer, Peterbilt deployed a rarely used weapon -- a lockout.
"Health costs are rising rapidly for all companies," Joe Scattergood, the plant manager, said. "The union has not had a single increase in out-of-pocket health expenses since 1994. Even with our proposals, we'll be covering 80 to 85 percent of the total cost of employee health care."
The lockout has thrown the mighty United Auto Workers on the defensive and has it grasping for ways to pressure Peterbilt, which appears in no rush to take the workers back because demand for trucks remains slack during the nation's economic slump. The union and management negotiated today without success, one of about a dozen sessions since the lockout began.
The six-month dispute has become a case study of the difficulties that unions face in hard times.
"This illustrates the theory of collective bargaining that when the economy declines and unemployment rises, unions lose bargaining power, and when the economy is on an upturn and unemployment falls, unions are in a better position," said Paul Clark, a professor of labor studies at Pennsylvania State University.
Heightening the pressure, Peterbilt, a division of PACCAR Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., has met demand for its trucks by relying on its nonunion plant in Denton, Tex. The U.A.W.'s efforts to unionize there have repeatedly faltered, enabling Peterbilt to squeeze the workers here by playing one plant off the other. 
The U.A.W. has contributed millions of dollars to continue health insurance for workers here and to pay many $200 a week in strike benefits, but some employees face eviction, some have had their pickup trucks repossessed and some have turned to food pantries for handouts. 
Outside the factory, Ms. Wilmoth and other workers spend their days standing, chatting and sometimes sitting in a small tent for shelter, all part of a test of wills. Every hour hundreds of cars and trucks stream by. A few drivers honk in solidarity, but most hardly seem to notice. 
Mr. Scattergood attributes the confrontation to the leaders of Local 1832 of the U.A.W. Had they only put Peterbilt's offer to a vote, he said, the workers might have accepted the proposed contract and the showdown might have been avoided at a factory that churns out 70 trucks a day during boom times.
"We are one of the finest employers in Middle Tennessee," Mr. Scattergood said. 
"We are offering people $22 an hour -- that's $45,000 a year," he said. "That's 80 percent higher thanthe median for factory workers in the area. We are offering a very, very good package, although our current proposal doesn't increase wages as much as some people would like."
Peterbilt is offering the workers annual raises of 1.8 percent for four years, which the union notes is less than the rate of inflation. The company wants union members to pay more toward their health coverage, raising the premiums of those with family coverage to $175 a month, from $80. The company also seeks to double co-payments for many prescription drugs.
Mike Pardue, president of Local 1832, said that between the modest wage increases and the rise in out-of-pocket health costs, management's offer would leave many workers with less money than before. "Last year the company had their fourth-most-profitable year ever -- they earned twice as much as the year before, so I don't know why they're offering us so little," he said. 
Mr. Pardue is especially galled that Peterbilt wants the right to change heath-care providers without the union's approval. He said management knew that any union would reject that plan, ensuring a confrontation that would let Peterbilt lock out the workers -- and save on labor costs during a slump in demand.
Mr. Pardue said he could not put management's proposals to a vote because Peterbilt had refused to disclose some requested information, including what changes have been made on health coverage at the Texas plant. Mr. Pardue said the workers needed such information to make an informed decision, but company officials said the workers could easily vote without it. 
Ron Petram, a plant electrician, said he distrusted the company.
"The wages are good," Mr. Petram said of his job. "The benefits are good. I give them 100 percent. I want to go back. But I don't understand what they're doing. My personal opinion is they just want to get rid of the union."
Mr. Scattergood denied that and said the factory always closed when contracts expired and no new agreement was in place. There have been five strikes since 1973, including a four-month strike in 1998 that was followed by a three-month lockout. 
"We think we're a great employer," Mr. Scattergood said. "We think we're pro-employee."
But union members said that if Peterbilt were truly pro-employee it would have never locked them out.
"If you ask me about who wins," said Tony Ragsdale, a Peterbilt worker for 32 years, "I don't know if there is a real winner in a situation like this."

HEADLINE: Energy Costs Produce Surge In Price Index 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21 

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose last month at the fastest pace in two years as energy costs surged before the war with Iraq. But with oil prices now dropping, economists predicted that inflation would slow.
 The Consumer Price Index, the most widely followed measure of inflation, jumped 0.6 percent in February, the most since a rise of 0.6 percent in January 2001. The so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, climbed 0.1 percent, resulting in the smallest 12-month gain since March 1966. 
 "There should be little fear of either inflation or deflation," said Drew Matus, a senior economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "This is what price stability feels like."
Expectations that the war with Iraq would be short set off a retreat in crude oil prices over the last two weeks that wiped out all of this year's gains.
Companies not involved in energy have had to use discounts and incentives to lure customers, as the recovery stumbled. Manufacturing slowed last month, consumer confidence reached a decade low and companies are reluctant to hire.
"Inflation pressures remain subdued," said Peter Kretzmer, a senior economist at Banc of America Securities in New York. The recovery is "restrained by continued soft consumer demand as households adjust to lower wealth levels" and by a general caution from consumers and businesses related to war and terrorism, he said.
The Consumer Price Index is the government's broadest gauge of costs for goods and services. Almost 60 percent of the index covers prices consumers pay for services, ranging from medical visits to airline fares and movie tickets. Goods, including food, clothing, autos and appliances, make up the rest.
Consumer prices were up 3 percent for the 12 months ended in February, compared with a 2.6 percent increase in the year through January. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 1.7 percent from February 2002.
While some economists predicted that prices for goods would fall because of stiff competition and excess capacity, rising costs for services suggest that deflation will not be a problem. Deflation, or a broad decline in prices, is dangerous because prices of finished goods can fall faster than the costs of making them, and the cost of debt rises, when adjusted for inflation, while profits collapse.
Energy prices, which account for about 7 percent of the index, jumped 5.9 percent in February, their biggest increase since June 2000; they rose 4 percent in January. Gasoline prices surged 9.9 percent, also the most since June 2000, after gaining 6.6 percent the month before.
Rising energy costs restrain growth, with the higher bills taking money out of consumers' pockets, and thus depressing spending levels. Household spending drives more than two-thirds of the economy. The higher energy prices will shave about half a percentage point from the economy's rate of growth this year, according to economists at Goldman Sachs.
Based on the direction of crude oil futures, gasoline prices could start falling in coming weeks. After they reached a 12-year high of $37.83 a barrel March 12, crude oil prices for May delivery fell $1.21 a barrel, to $26.91, today on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 4.3 percent from Thursday.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: MARKET PLACE; 
A Bitof History: Sometimes War Sends Shares Higher, Sometimes Lower

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Theguns began to roar this week, and stocks began to soar, not just in the United States but around the world.
 Something similar happened in 1991, when the allied bombing of Iraq began. 
 But that does not mean wars are always good for stocks.
Broadly speaking, United States stocks rise during wartime when traders think events have turned in the country's favor. 
American share prices fell sharply at the beginning of World War I, World War II and the Korean War. They also fell after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. But in each case they recovered, sometimes before it was clear that the war news was improving.
One of the worst weeks for the stock market came during the week of May 18, 1940, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.4 percent as the French army crumbled in the face of the German invasion.
The Dow continued to slide as the war went on and fell 6.5 percent in the three days after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. The market did not bottom until the spring of 1942, when the Dow was down 37 percent from where it was just before the Battle of France began. But prices began to pick up even before the Battle of Midway in June 1942 signaled that the fortunes of war were turning.
By the time the war ended on Aug. 14, 1945, the Dow was up 77 percent from its 1942 low but was only 14 percent above its level when Germany attacked France.
In the final week of July 1914, as it became obvious that a war was about to begin, prices on the New York Stock Exchange fell 11.5 percent in the first four days of the week and appeared likely to open sharply lower on July 31 as sell orders poured in from Europe. The exchange was ordered closed and did not reopen until Dec. 12.
By then, it appeared clear that American business was benefiting from war-related orders and the Dow ended the first day up 4.4 percent from the prices just before trading halted. By the time the United States entered the war, on April 6, 1917, the Dow was 73 percent higher than it had been when the market reopened. But it slipped over the remainder of the war, which ended in 1918.
The Dow fell 4.7 percent the day after the Korean War began on June 25, 1950, and was down 12 percent within a month. But it recovered all that lost ground by mid-September as American forces staged a dramatic invasion at Inchon that assured there would be no quick North Korean victory.
The Vietnam War sort of crept up on American consciousness. But many stocks peaked in 1966, not long after the American involvement escalated in 1965. And by the time the war finally ended, in 1975, the American economy had gone through a severe recession and share prices were far below where they had been in the mid-1960's.
The Persian Gulf war is remembered as a boon for stocks, but that was not how it seemed when hostilities erupted. The Dow fell 6.3 percent during the three days after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, and was down 19 percent by the time prices bottomed in October. Share prices shot up 4.6 percent on Jan. 17, 1991, after the beginning of the international attack on Iraq. And by the time the war ended with a cease-fire on March 3, the Dow was back to where it was before the Iraqi invasion began.
This week, as the latest war began, the Dow rose 8.4 percent, to 8,521.97. But even with those gains, it remains a little below where it was on Nov. 8, when the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1441, offering Iraq a "last chance" to disarm.
In both recent cases, 1990-91 and 2002-3, a weak American economy, brought on in part by sharply higher oil prices, helped to depress share prices. In 1990, oil prices topped out in October and had fallen significantly even before the American bombing began. This year they topped out on March 10, the day before the stock market started a rally that has now lasted eight days.

HEADLINE: Yonkers Gets Pledges of Aid For Housing After Big Fires 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: YONKERS, March 21 

 BODY:
State and federal officials came here today to announce that housing vouchers would be made available for some of the estimated 500 people left homeless this month by two fires, among the most destructive in this city's history.
 At a City Hall news conference, Gov. George E. Pataki said the state Division of Housing and Community Renewal would offer 200 vouchers to fire victims whose incomes qualify. Assistant Secretary Michael Liu of the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development promised 95 vouchers to help residents pay rents or buy homes. 
 While the announcement came as good news for a city reeling from the fires, some officials said the vouchers would offer only limited help in Westchester County's housing market, where supplies are short and prices are high. 
Many of those displaced by the first fire, on March 14 in the low-income Nodine Hill neighborhood, are people on public assistance and immigrants who had been crowded into apartments. Although many of those burned out in the second fire, on Sunday in the Wakefield Towers apartments on Bronx River Road, are better off financially, some are retirees on limited incomes. 
To qualify for the state vouchers, a family of three must have an annual income lower than $41,150 and meet certain other guidelines. Mr. Liu, who said he wanted those left homeless "fast-tracked" into housing, said the federal vouchers had similar requirements. 
Representative Nita M. Lowey said she appreciated the vouchers, but was also concerned about the scarcity of suitable housing. "Prices have gradually gone up and up," she said. "We need stock, and we need to understand where vacancies are and what kind of incentives we can give to landlords to upgrade housing and not just take advantage." 
Immediately after the fires, Mayor John D. Spencer said his office would talk to real estate agents, housing agencies and landlords to assemble a list of available apartments. But many people displaced by the fire worry that the apartments will be out of their price range, and some officials agree that finding lower-income housing will not be easy.
"When a community finds itself with 500 people in need of homes, it's extremely difficult," said Richard Halevy, a spokesman for the mayor. "Part of the problem we are encountering is prices." 
Another looming problem, said Robert L. Lenseth, the chief executive of the American Red Cross in Westchester County, is that many renters in Nodine Hill squeezed seven or more tenants into a small apartment in order to afford it. "But we can't set them up like that in a new one because it's in violation of housing regulations," Mr. Lenseth said. "It's a Catch-22." 
Officials said today that all the fire victims had found homes, but that many were living with friends and family, and no one is sure how long that can last. "These arrangements work for the emergency period only," Mr. Lenseth said.
Delmi Cubias, 34, who was burned out of her Nodine Hill apartment, has taken her family of five to live with another large family in an apartment in Port Chester.
When she could manage it this week, Mrs. Cubias drove her 4-year-old son, George, to school in Yonkers. A spokeswoman for the public schools here said that of the 52 students uprooted by the fires, 12 had not returned to school.
In Nodine Hill, the Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church has filled two rooms with donations, from clothes to shoes to candy canes, Velveeta and Band-Aids. The church, which is also serving as the Red Cross center, bustled today with volunteers from Yonkers, Ossining, the Bronx and elsewhere.
"We're a local church and not skilled in this type of thing," said the Rev. Debra Avery, as Mrs. Cubias's 2-year-old daughter, Natalie, whizzed by on a donated scooter. "So we're just winging it. We're making it up as we go along."

 BODY:
House Approves Budget, Including Deep Tax Cuts
The House approved a $2.2 trillion spending plan for the next fiscal year by a three-vote margin that would make room for the deep tax cuts proposed by President Bush and lead to deficits for the rest of this decade.
 The Senate later rejected a move to cut the president's tax package by more than half and seemed to be on track to passage of a final version of a budget plan. Page A8. 

Weill Nominated for Exchange Board
Sanford I. Weill, the chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, the biggest underwriter of stocks and bonds in the nation, has been nominated to serve on the board of the New York Stock Exchange -- not as a representative of Wall Street, where he has spent almost his entire career, but of the investing public. The chief executives of two other big financial services companies, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, have been nominated to represent the securities industry. The difference between those men and Mr. Weill, said an exchange spokesman, is that their operations derive much more of their revenue from the trading of stocks. C2.

Philip Morris Faces Big Penalty
A judge in Illinois ordered Philip Morris to pay $10.1 billion in a class-action consumer fraud suit for failing to inform consumers that its "light" and "low-tar" cigarettes are not less harmful than full-flavored cigarettes. In one of the more striking elements of the ruling, the judge wrote that Philip Morris knew that light and low-tar cigarettes were actually more harmful than their regular counterparts. A6.

China Addresses Lack of Oil Reserve
China remains the world's largest economy without a strategic petroleum reserve. And with war once again raging in the Persian Gulf, China is hoping that neither military forces nor terrorists and saboteurs will disrupt its flow of energy imports. C2.

Union Seeks New Path at Peterbilt
Workers at a Peterbilt truck factory in Tennessee have been locked out of their jobs since September in a dispute over pay and benefits. The lockout has thrown the mighty United Auto Workers on the defensive. A6.

Consumer Prices Rose in February
Consumer prices rose last month at the fastest pace in two years as energy costs surged before the war with Iraq. But with oil prices now dropping, economists predicted inflation would slow. The Consumer Price Index jumped 0.6 percent, the most since a 0.6 percent jump in January 2001, but the so-called core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, climbed 0.1 percent, resulting in the smallest 12-month gain since March 1966. C14.

Talks on European Economy Falter
Heads of state from the 15 member nations of the European Union made only limited progress on plans to re-energize the faltering European economy at their two-day meeting in Brussels. C2.

El Paso Settles Energy Suits
The El Paso Corporation has settled suits that accused the company of manipulating gas prices during California's energy crisis. As a result, it will reduce fourth-quarter net income by $650 million. C3.

South Korean Economy Grows 6.8%
The Bank of Korea said the economy grew by 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, raising growth for the year to 6.3 percent, but said decreased consumer spending would lower growth to below 5 percent for at least the first quarter of 2003. C2.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: REAL ESTATE; 
RealEstate Shows Scattered Signs Of Skittishness

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER and JENNIFER BAYOT

 BODY:
Joy Howell had planned to put her Washington condominium on the market this week, until real estate agents advised her that buyers might be skittish about a place just blocks from the White House.
 "I decided to just postpone putting it on the market," Ms. Howell said. "People are a little bit nervous about real estate right now in this area, and they're not quite sure what impact going to war might have on the local economy." And, she added, "they're a little bit concerned about being a target." 
 It is far too soon to see a statistical change in home sales and prices, but real estate agents and brokers in Washington and New York City offered anecdotal evidence that over the last week both buyers and sellers have decided to wait and see whether the war goes well and whether terrorists mount attacks in reprisal. 
"The market has never experienced this kind of fear factor," said Tsegaye Tadesse, an agent for ReMax Capital in Washington, where the interest in home selling and buying has fallen. Some buyers are worried that the value of their investment could plummet in the wake of an attack, while sellers are worried that they will get shoddy offers because buyers are jumpy, he said. Underlying these tough-to-measure worries are concerns that interest rates may begin to climb, especially if the war drags on and the federal deficit grows sharply. In New York, some homeowners who plan to buy or sell have postponed their plans. "We are seeing a number of people sitting on the fence," said Pamela Liebman, chief executive of the Corcoran Group, a residential real estate firm. "If it's a short war, they'll jump back in. They're waiting."
Ms. Liebman said the reluctance was primarily at the high end of the market. Below that, low interest rates have kept buying and selling brisk.
That was the case on Thursday. Yesterday, a $1.7 million Manhattan apartment newly on the market attracted 15 viewing appointments by the end of the afternoon, Ms. Liebman said, surmising that the war's start had meant a relief from uncertainty for many New Yorkers. 
The last shock to housing, after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, had much more immediate and unambiguous consequences. In the weeks after the attacks, prices and sales in the residential market declined nationwide, and fell even further in New York and Washington, according to the National Association of Realtors.
Other cities were also affected. "It almost literally came to a stop for a week or two," recalled Avram Goldman, president of the San Francisco Bay Area franchise of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage. "If we look back and compare now to post-9/11, we're nowhere near where it was then." 
Homeowners anticipated this war, he said. "Even going back to the Iraqi war in '91 -- even that came as more of a shock."
Still, Mr. Goldman has observed some subtle changes in the mood of the Bay Area housing market since the war began. Buyers in negotiations are slightly more tense and hesitant, he said, and offers on properties are not as forthcoming.
"I think there will certainly be a segment that will hold off for a while," as much out of fear as out of fascination with the world's affairs, Mr. Goldman said. "I think there will be some people, certainly, that will be glued to their TV's."
Nevertheless, he added, "the majority of the market is going forward with their plans."
Some potential sellers in Philadelphia are also holding off, according to Prudential Fox & Roach Realtors in Devon, Pa., the largest agency serving the area. Fewer properties are going on sale there than even in February, when activity fell after several snowstorms. 
The current wartime slackening "is by no means enormous," said Stephen R. Storti, the firm's vice president for marketing.
"But there is, of course, going to be some effect," he added. "It is making people hesitate because they don't know what's happening with the economy." Then again, he added, the slowdown may simply be an extension of the February falloff. 
Agents pointed to the time after Sept. 11 in suggesting that any retreat in sales would be short-lived. After the initial shock of the terror attacks, housing prices quickly recovered both nationally and in New York and Washington, said Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors. 
"Within a few weeks it had bounced back and we set a new record," he said. Moreover, the association estimates that 5.5 million existing homes will be sold this year, down only slightly from 5.6 million last year. "All that happened was a temporary disruption in the marketplace," Mr. Molony said.
Despite anxieties in some big cities, there are few signs that real estate markets in most parts of the country have been affected by war and terror-related fears. The farther a home for sale is from downtown Washington or Manhattan, the less of a concern terror attacks seem to be, agents said.
Dale Mattison, an associate broker for Long & Foster Realtors in Washington, said he had noticed no buyers or sellers holding off.
"Because of all the upheaval in world affairs, people are looking to things that might comfort them, and a new home is one of those kinds of things," Mr. Mattison said. "Over all if you look at the numbers of transactions, we're not seeing any noticeable dip in the market."
Brokers and agents also said they had not seen any panic sellers -- people trying to move out of cities perceived as high risk. Ms. Howell, for example, said she was planning to move to another building only a little farther from the White House than her current condominium. 
"I'm a committed Washingtonian," she said.

He Does Not Need Acclaim, Just House Paint and Plywood

BYLINE:  By ADAM COHEN 

DATELINE: MONTGOMERY, Ala. 

 BODY:
Moses Tolliver sat on his bed, in a simple wooden house in downtown Montgomery, surrounded by his art: "pure house paint" on plywood, hung from the walls by soda pop-tops -- and, improbably enough, a photograph of himself with Nancy Reagan at a White House reception in his honor. Rubbing Vaseline on his knee as a gas heater sent scorching air his way, he talked about the sad circumstances that led him to paint.
 Mr. Tolliver, widely known as Mose T, is a legend these days, the only artist still alive from the Corcoran's seminal 1982 exhibition of African-American folk art. I first met him a decade ago, and I've bought a few paintings over the years: a pterodactyl-like yellow bird, an armadillo, an electric-slide-dancing couple for friends who were getting married. I was visiting again because I'm a fan, and also to use Mose T as a touchstone. A few weeks earlier, Christie's had held an auction that raised troubling questions about the impact that commerce will have on the rarefied world of folk art. 
 Mose T, who is in his mid-80's, was born to a sharecropping family on the outskirts of Montgomery. He had a few years of formal education and eventually moved to a housing project in town. As a young man, he worked as a gardener and landscaper in a wealthy white neighborhood. To earn extra money, he helped sweep up at a furniture factory. One day while he was sweeping, a pile of marble fell on his leg and hip. "It was so quick," he said with a sigh. After months in a body cast, he was permanently disabled.
His employers at the furniture factory helped him buy the house he still lives in. To fill his time, and to deal with the depression that descended on him, they also encouraged him to paint. He worked on his porch -- his wife, Willie Mae, "didn't want me in the house," he recalled -- and sold paintings to people passing by. Prices were modest, and negotiable: a few dollars, a bag of peas, a can of beer.
Mose T's subjects were often the birds and flowers that had surrounded him when he was a gardener. "He painted what he loved, or what he missed being around," said Marcia Weber, a Montgomery art dealer who has known Mose T for years. He created a few singular images that he returns to again and again: trees of life, little dancing jig-jag ladies, erotic moose ladies and self-portraits -- some benign, some fierce.
The paintings have few brush strokes and generally use only two or three colors. He often simulates a frame by painting along the edges of the wood in a contrasting color of paint. "He has his own style," Ms. Weber said. "People may imitate it, but he hasn't imitated anyone." One of the best tipoffs that a purported Mose T is not authentic -- a common problem in acquiring his work -- is that the style is too elaborate, or it uses too many colors.
Mose T's life is integral to his painting, and to how the art world views it. "Outsider art" -- the term now in vogue for the work of self-taught, culturally isolated or mentally ill artists -- is defined by the artist's background, not the work itself. Outsider art has grown in popularity since the early 1980's, but it still exists on a different economic plane than fine art. When Howard Finster, the white Georgia minister and noted folk artist, was alive, you could stop at his home and buy an Uncle Sam painted on wood for $75. It is still possible to pick up a small painting from Mose T for a price in the very low three figures.
The Christie's sale, the first auction of outsider art at a major auction house, may be the dawn of a new era. With dealers and investors talking about eliminating the "grass ceiling" separating outsider and fine art, the house priced aggressively. A work by Martin Ramirez, who drew while institutionalized in California in the 1950's and 1960's, went for a record price of nearly $100,000. A limestone carving by William Edmondson, who died in 1951, reached $300,000, though it failed to sell.
There is certainly much to be said for outsider art's getting more respect, and for the artists' being better compensated. But it is a Faustian bargain because capitalism alters everything it touches. Many folk artists are being talked into painting more commercial subjects -- even doing paintings from photographs. Mr. Finster, in his final years, sold in bulk over a Web site and with a toll-free number, (800) FINSTER. At some point, the outsiders become insiders, and the art itself is transformed.
Mose T, sitting among his simple birds and watermelons on plywood, shows few signs of changing. But in an age when public television sponsorships look more and more like commercials, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants to name parks after corporations that contribute to their upkeep, it may be unrealistic to expect outsider art to remain outside the economic mainstream. Art dealers and auction houses can be counted on to keep up the pressure. After all, outsider art has a unique beauty that comes from the authenticity of its voice, and its distance from the commercial realm. If art dealers can package and sell that, they'll have it made.

HEADLINE: In Montclair, the 'Dream House' Can Often Be Exactly That 

BYLINE:  By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR, N.J., March 21 

 BODY:
Beth Bauer and her husband, Gary Lynch, both actors, spent the better part of a year trying to buy a house in this community they admired for its schools, its turn-of-the-century charm and its diversity. Eight times, they bid on a house they wanted. Eight times, they were outbid. 
 Finally, last year, the couple gave up and bought a home in nearby West Orange. 
 "We had fallen in love with the town over the course of the years," Ms. Bauer said about Montclair, where they have friends and family, and where they were renting a house as they looked for one to buy. "We were looking in the south parts of Montclair too, and some of the places were horrible, but we still could not win the bids." 
Like many communities in the New York metropolitan area, housing prices in Montclair have reached the stratosphere in the last couple of years, pricing real estate out of reach for middle-income wage earners like actors, artists, schoolteachers and municipal workers. 
What is different here is that Montclair, more than most expensive suburbs, is a place that prides itself on its racial and economic diversity. In short, if Montclair cannot find a way to provide housing ordinary people can afford, it does not bode well for other communities facing soaring housing prices. 
"It's nice to be mayor of a town that's popular and attractive," said Mayor Robert Russo, of this town of tree-lined streets and gracious Victorian homes just west of New York City. "But I have a social conscience. I want to make sure that all sorts of people can live here, people who grew up here, the elderly, people of all racial and economic classes. I don't want this to become a town of just wealthy folks."
Last year, 434 homes sold in Montclair, with an average selling price of $400,557, according to the New Jersey Association of Realtors. In 1992, the average selling price was $256,772. 
And as housing costs have soared, the topic of how to keep the town affordable to people of all incomes has dominated conversations among many residents here, from the mayor to housing advocates to high school students. 
At Montclair High School, students at the Center for Social Justice conducted a letter-writing campaign to state officials, including Gov. James E. McGreevey, complaining that the town did not have enough housing for people who were not bankers or titans of Wall Street. Today, some students held a conference on the topic.
A group of civic leaders are planning an affordable-housing conference for Saturday to discuss ways to help people with low and moderate incomes afford to live here. Other meetings the group has held in the last few months drew standing-room-only crowds.
And town council members, several of whom will take part in the conference, will explore measures they can take. 
One major initiative is a recently approved ordinance that will require developers to pay a fee equal to 1 percent of their development costs into a fund to establish more low-cost housing. Homeowners making major additions would pay a similar fee.
Some town council members say they are also considering adopting rent stabilization or rent control measures to make housing more affordable to renters.
One of the organizers of Saturday's conference is Beverly M. Riddick, executive director of HOMECorp, a nonprofit group here that buys low-cost homes using federal grants and other sources, renovates them and then sells or rents them to people with income below a certain level. But in the last few months, her agency has been getting outbid on even the most rundown properties. 
"What we're left with is a town far more homogenous than people moved here for in the first place," she said. "The township council has stood up and said we don't want that to happen.
"I think it's the difference between it becoming like Short Hills or a town like what it is today," she said.
The comparison reflects the degree to which diversity is a part of the civic culture here.
One primary reason for the town's diversity is the public school district's magnet program. When the district was forced to desegregate in the 1970's, officials decided that instead of busing, they would create magnet programs in each of the schools open to students anywhere in the township, but they would make sure that each school, and each classroom, was racially balanced.
As a result, race is a topic that pervades many discussions and decisions, sometimes to a degree that may seem excessive to outsiders. For example, when students at a local elementary school performed "Alice in Wonderland" a few years ago, a new girl played Alice after every scene change. By the end, more than a dozen girls of various races, dressed in identical blue dresses and white pinafores, had taken their turn on stage. 
The town's population of 38,977 is 60 percent white, 32 percent black and 5 percent Hispanic. But the more defining statistics seem to be those about wealth. Jerry Kloby, coordinator of Montclair State University's Institute for Community Studies, points out that 13 percent of Montclair's households have incomes of more than $200,000, while 23 percent have incomes of less than $35,000. As housing prices rise, that spread will continue to widen, he said.
"What happens to a community when there are groups of people with interests that are becoming more and more divergent?" Mr. Kloby asked.
The question is especially vexing as the price tags on homes swell to more than $1 million for Victorian- and Tudor-style houses on Upper Mountain Avenue with views of Manhattan, and more than $300,000 for fixer-uppers in more neglected parts of the township. 
Town leaders say there is not much they can do about the high price of homes, but they believe there is much more they can learn about how to set aside housing for people with lower incomes. "We're not going to be disingenuous," said Ed Remsen, a town councilman. "I own a home here and it's nice to know it's worth more than I paid. But a lot of what we are trying to do is say that affordable housing is a core value of this community, and the responsibility for it is everyone's."
Montclair has provided 800 units of so-called affordable housing in 10 years, more than other communities of the same size, said Karen Kadus, the township's planning director. 
Some of this has been accomplished by requiring developers to set aside a certain number of housing units for low- or moderate-income families and through rehabilitation of abandoned structures. 
The township is also getting $1 million from the town of East Hanover in Morris County that it will use to create 42 units of lower-priced housing by rehabilitating existing homes. The arrangement is part of the state's Mount Laurel program, which requires communities to build low- and moderate-income housing but allows some towns to pass on the funds for such housing to other communities. 
George Burroughs, a teacher at Montclair High School who supervises the students in the Center for Social Justice who held the housing conference, knows about the housing situation firsthand. In trying to teach his students by example, he also works with the Montclair Tenants Association to help protect renters from unfair landlord practices.
A lawyer by training, he has gone to court with some of the association's clients, so he knows what higher real estate values mean in terms of changing a community. A year and a half ago, he bought a home here, where he grew up. He and his wife had previously lost out several times to other bidders, so they did what he almost did not want to do -- overbid. 
"The paradox is that people want to come to Montclair because of the diversity, ethnic and cultural as well as economic, but when they come, they push other people out," he said. "We did the same thing. After losing out on three homes, we said, 'We don't want to go through that again,' and we got caught up in the whole madness."
The housing issue is most intense for people like Marjorie Auletta, 62, an assistant librarian here. She is the fifth generation in her family to live in Montclair. But she may be the last.
For seven years, Mrs. Auletta has rented the second and third floors of a two-family home on North Fullerton Avenue where she lives with three grandchildren she is raising.
When home prices were heating up last year, her house was sold, and the new owner promptly raised her $1,150 monthly rent by more than $400, an increase she is barely managing on her $25,000 annual salary. 
Now the house is up for sale again, and Mrs. Auletta, a widow, is afraid that the new owner will either raise her rent again or evict her to convert the home back into a one-family house, as many buyers are doing. If that happens, she wonders if she will have to move to another town. 
"I love Montclair," said Mrs. Auletta. "I've always been proud to say I'm from Montclair."
She continued: "Being an affluent town should mean more than just money. It also means the richness of the town, more than the dollar. It means how people treat each other, the vitality of the town. If people allow other people to mistreat each other, it's going to be a pretty cold place here."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: WITH THE TROOPS -- FIRST MARINE DIVISION; 
Marines Race to Attack As Iraqi Oil Wells Burn

BYLINE:  By JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: WITH THE FIRST MARINE DIVISION, South Rumaila Oil Field, Iraq, March 21 

 BODY:
A lonely camel lopes through the dust under a Marine Huey helicopter, but across the vast stretch of Iraqi desert, the eye is riveted on two things: seemingly endless convoys of American and some British military vehicles grinding north and northwest on every paved highway, and bright orange plumes of flame and gray-black smoke from a half-dozen burning oil wells.
 That all of this oil field -- one of the world's richest -- is not completely ablaze is a result of a swift assault that began at dusk on Thursday, more than 12 hours ahead of schedule. It was an attack that was in part planned, in part improvised on the fly by elements of the First Marine Division. 
 "Initially, we were planning on going in this morning," said Capt. Shawn Blodgett, whose company seized an oil-refining area, GOSP-4, the abbreviation for a gas-oil separation plant. 
"We were at a staff meeting when the call came down," Captain Blodgett said at a sand-blown base here this afternoon as four wells burned on the horizon.
Within minutes of the call last evening, more than 200 marines, along with a handful of British ordnance specialists, were headed north in a column of 28 Humvees, amphibious assault vehicles and other transports. 
A second wave of the attack began at 6 a.m. today (10 p.m. Thursday Eastern time) with more marines breaching the border along a wide front. 
By nightfall, nearly all of the division's 20,000 troops were inside Iraq, driving some 60 miles to the Euphrates River and taking control of a large swath of territory, often simply bypassing smaller Iraqi positions.
The Iraqi Army's 51st Mechanized Division crumbled swiftly, senior Marine officers said, and their commander formally surrendered.
"Their officers have cut and run," a Marine intelligence officer said this morning, adding that many of the Iraqi officers appeared to have fled to the city of Basra.
The marines, a senior officer said, were now poised to drive either north or west, both directions that could lead to Baghdad, posing difficult decisions for an enemy commander on the defensive.
"We're presenting him with a number of problems," the senior officer said, "more than he can get his arms around."
The Marines had moved the entire division, which was based in Kuwait, to forward positions along the border in the last few days, speeding up their preparations after President Bush's speech on Monday night. Still, the timing was uncertain.
That all changed at 5 p.m. Thursday when Col. John Kelly, the division's assistant commander, received a message from higher command that Iraqi forces had begun setting the southern oil fields ablaze. 
The news brought fears of a repetition of the destruction of the 1991 Persian Gulf war, when hundreds of Kuwaiti wells were set on fire by retreating Iraqi forces, with great economic and ecological losses. 
Colonel Kelly, a Boston Irishman who has been promoted to the rank of brigadier general but is waiting to pin on his star inside Iraq, quickly called Col. Joe Dunford, commander of the Fifth Regimental Combat Team, a force of 6,000 troops reinforced with additional tanks, artillery and combat engineers. Their job would be to take and hold the oil fields.
How fast could he get an attack organized? Colonel Kelly asked.
Four hours, Colonel Dunford replied.
When Colonel Kelly called back 15 minutes later, Colonel Dunford already had marines on the road and said he could cut the time to two hours.
But artillery and air support had to be organized as well, so a timetable of three hours for the main attack was agreed upon.
As a first wave of Super Cobra helicopter gunships buzzed north at 6:25 p.m., the division's artillery units began a barrage against Iraqi positions. The booms, crumps and flashes of the shells lit up the horizon throughout the night.
At 8:35, the first marines crossed the border, which was marked by barriers of sand berms, fences and antitank trenches 12 feet deep and wide.
They had been expecting at least 12 hours' notice, recalled Lt. Col. Frederick M. Padilla, the commander of the First Battalion. 
"We were in a meeting when I got the yellow canary," he said, referring to the yellow four-part carbon paper slips on which orders are passed in the Marines. "The message was, 'Move out now, move out immediately.' I'm saving it."
Troops under his command destroyed two aged T-55 Soviet-made tanks with Javelin antitank missiles.
There was another sharp battle at a pumping station in the oil fields in which dug-in Iraqi troops fought with machine guns and small arms and a marine second lieutenant was killed. Otherwise, Marine officers described resistance as light, with increasing numbers of Iraqi soldiers surrendering.
"We thrive in the imperfect; we excel at friction," Colonel Padilla said, using Marine jargon for difficulty. The oil field having been taken, he was relaxing in a folding chair at his new command post.
"Last night was nothing but friction," he said. "Friction and the fog of war."

STATE STREET SHARES FALL AFTER EARNINGS WARNING

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 Shares of the State Street Corporation had their biggest drop in almost 10 years after the company said a prolonged decline in stock prices and low interest rates would reduce per share earnings by about half this quarter. 
The stock of the company, which is based in Boston, fell $4.39, or 11 percent, to $34.11 a share. The announcement by State Street, a financial services company, ends a three-year string of increased quarterly profit. The chief executive, David Spina, said that the bank would have to cut more jobs than the 1,000 already set to be eliminated because of an acquisition.

HEADLINE: Cuba Arrests More Dissidents Amid Outcry 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 21 

 BODY:
Cuban authorities continued their islandwide roundup of dissidents, journalists and other opposition figures today, even as representatives of Latin American nations introduced a resolution at the United Nations Human Rights Commission condemning the country's human rights record.
 Diplomats and dissidents said at least 72 people, and possibly as many as 87, have been arrested since the crackdown began on Tuesday. They face criminal charges for collaborating with American diplomats opposed to President Fidel Castro. 
 Several high-profile dissidents have been arrested, including Raul Rivero, the dean of the country's independent journalists. Opposition supporters said the crackdown had battered the Varela Project, a petition drive seeking political, civil and economic freedoms.
Cuban authorities said those arrested were traitors organized and paid by the United States, specifically by James Cason, the chief American diplomat in Havana. Mr. Cason has held numerous high-profile meetings with dissidents, and has made some strongly critical statements against the government.
The sweep, widely seen as the largest since the mid-1990's, has drawn sharp rebukes from human rights defenders, journalists' associations and international figures, including former President Jimmy Carter, who met with many of those now detained during his visit to Cuba last May. A handful of leading dissidents, including Oswaldo Paya, leader of the Varela Project, remain free but under police surveillance.
"The international community supports their rights to the protections afforded by the Cuban Constitution," Mr. Carter said in a statement. "I call on the Cuban government to respect those rights and to refrain from detaining or harassing citizens who are expressing their views peacefully."
Peru introduced a resolution critical of Cuba at the United Nations human rights meeting in Geneva today, and that may complicate Cuban efforts to seek trade and aid from the European Union. 
"This is the most serious setback in years," said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director for Human Rights Watch. "Yet they calculated that it was more important to remind those pushing for change inside the island that the repressive regime sets the rules of the game."
Juan Hernandez Acen, the spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section in Washington, likened the arrests to the United States' crackdown on terrorists after the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
"These people have not been arrested for what they think," Mr. Hernandez said. "They were arrested because they are directly linked to the active conspiracy and subversion being done by James Cason."
Wayne Smith, the chief American diplomat in Havana during the Carter administration, said Mr. Cason had provoked the Cuban government into overreacting.
Cuban officials said the opposition was a small group. But Arturo Valenzuela, a former member of the National Security Council, said Havana nonetheless felt threatened.
"The fact the government has made these arrests means these people are much more dangerous that it has let on," he said. "It shows they are a threat to the regime."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: WALL STREET; 
Dow's Week Is the Best In 20 Years

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Stocks soared yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to its best weekly performance in more than 20 years.
 The Dow gained 8.4 percent in the week that war began, while the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index rose 7.5 percent, its best week since the rebound after the terrorist attacks in September 2001. The rally pushed both indexes into positive territory for the year, along with the Nasdaq composite index. 
 Investors flocked to stocks yesterday as they watched the Iraqi war from trading floors and offices, and the news was generally positive. Reports circulated that President Saddam Hussein might have been injured and that allied troops might be near Baghdad soon. Later in the day, American and British forces began an intense bombing campaign aimed at Baghdad and at least two other cities to the north. 
After weeks of gloom about a possible war, investor sentiment has reversed quickly. Just nine trading days ago, the Dow and the S.& P. 500 index were within striking distance of the five-year stock market lows of last October.
This week, though, investors moved into stocks and caused bond prices to suffer their sharpest decline since December 2001. Since the war-related rally began on March 12, the three major stock gauges are up more than 11.75 percent. As for bonds, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note has jumped to 4.10 percent from 3.57 percent, a 44-year low.
After a couple of calm days and the war's beginning, the stock market finished the week strong, perhaps accentuated by the expiration of options contracts. The Dow industrials and the S.& P. 500-stock index rose more than 2 percent on Friday, and the Nasdaq composite index rose more than 1 percent.
The last time that the Dow had such a strong showing was the week that ended on Oct. 8, 1982, just months after the beginning of what became the great bull market of the 1980's and 1990's. The Nasdaq's weekly gain of 6 percent was its best since October 2002.
In describing the impact of a war on the stock market, several analysts and economists said the current war could not be compared to major conflicts of the past. World War II lasted a long time and had a major impact on the economy.
"You can't compare the two, absolutely not," said Henry Kaufman, president of Henry Kaufman & Company. "This is a sigh of relief," he said of the current stock rally.
Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, said, "The anticipation of war creates uncertainty, and the start of the war reduces that uncertainty," adding that because of the earlier decline a bounce was due.
The other big impact on stocks, he said, has been the swing in the price of crude oil, which neared $38 a barrel at its peak ahead of war. Now the price is below $27, which should help revive consumer spending and the stock market, he said.
Richard Bernstein, the United States equity strategist at Merrill Lynch, said that investors were ignoring economic fundamentals, which he said had been deteriorating, with rising unemployment claims and indications of weakening in the manufacturing sector. "People are jumping in without regard to the fundamentals because they are afraid of getting left behind," he said. Investors have assumed, he added, that stocks would rally at the start of a war just as they did in the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
It is not clear yet if this change in sentiment reflects mostly a reversal of bets that the economy would continue to weaken and the stock market drift lower or shows a long-term interest in buying stocks.
Data on mutual funds showed a net flow of $288 million into domestic stock funds in the week ended Wednesday, the first time that money poured into the funds since the week ended Jan. 15, when the net gain was $307 million, according to AMG Data Services. As for bond funds, the four-week average inflow of $4.7 billion dropped to $908 million in the last week.
While Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Banc of America Securities, highlighted this stock inflow in his report to clients yesterday, he also said that "the paucity of the inflow seems to confirm our sense that this rally is not the result of surging new demand for stocks."
The Dow finished the day up 235.37 points, or 2.8 percent, at 8,521.97. The S.& P. 500 index rose 20.06 points, or 2.3 percent to 895.90. The Nasdaq climbed 19.07 points, or 1.4 percent, to 1,421.84.
Trading volume was 1.9 billion shares, above the recent average of 1.4 billion shares, but well below the recent high of 2.8 billion. Trading may have been fueled yesterday by the expiration of futures and option contracts on the indexes and individual stocks.
For the year, the Dow is now up 2.2 percent and the S.& P. 500 index 1.8 percent. The Nasdaq has a 6.4 percent gain for the year. All three gauges, though, remain below their highs of early January. 
European stock markets, which were driven lower than their American counterparts ahead of war, also had big gains this week. Germany's DAX index rose 13.1 percent, its best performance since September 2001.
Among the stocks leading the American market higher were 3M, Caterpillar, United Technologies, General Electric, Pfizer and Intel. The stock of State Street, a custodian of assets, was down 12.6 percent in afternoon trading after the company announced that its earnings would be cut in half this quarter because of lower interest rates.
Positive developments in the war will continue to support the stock market, but the accompanying rise in interest rates could cut off the mortgage refinancing boom that emerged because of low interest rates.
Freddie Mac reported this week that the average national rate on a 30-year mortgage had jumped to 5.79 percent, from 5.61 percent last week, the lowest mortgage rates since at least the early 1960's.
Other economic data has been fuzzy and may not begin to look positive soon. In recent weeks, signs of slowing growth, including a sharp decline in jobs in February, have prompted many economists to scale back their growth forecasts for this year.
In the bond market, the price of the 10-year note plunged 1 5/32 to 98 5/32 as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, shot up to 4.10 percent, from 3.96 percent Wednesday.
The dollar rallied, rising 0.7 percent against the euro, to $1.0534, and 0.9 percent against the Japanese yen, to 121.51.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: EUROPE; 
France Opposes Proposal For U.S.-British Rule in Iraq

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, March 21 

 BODY:
The battle within Europe prompted by the war in Iraq raged on today as President Jacques Chirac of France vowed to oppose a British idea for a Security Council resolution that would give the United States and Britain the right to govern Iraq.
 On the second and final day of a meeting that brought together the 15 leaders of the European Union, Britain continued its verbal attack against France, and Germany announced that it would meet separately with France and Belgium -- the countries most opposed to the war -- to discuss how to strengthen Europe's military capability. 
 No one could remember a European Union leadership meeting more tense and surreal. The war with Iraq, which has battered European unity, intruded at every turn. 
As the leaders proclaimed their commitment to open their energy markets, create jobs, set up a single air-traffic control zone and make Europe the most competitive economy in the world, dozens of television screens mounted throughout the European Union headquarters here carried live news of the war.
The disconnect underscored an important point: while Europe may be able to come together on issues affecting its economy, it is more divided than ever on how to defend itself and project power around the world.
The deepest fissure was between Britain and France, whose leaders seemed to be talking past each other about the postwar administration of Iraq. Rejecting an idea floated by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain earlier in the day for a resolution to give international authority to an occupation government in Baghdad, Mr. Chirac told a news conference, "This idea of a resolution seems to me to be a way of authorizing military intervention after the fact and so is not from my point of view fitting in the current situation."
Asked in a news conference whether he and his fellow leaders in Europe want a United Nations mandate over Iraq as soon as possible, Mr. Blair replied that a resolution was necessary, not just to address the potential humanitarian crisis in the country but also to authorize what he called "the post-Saddam civil authority" in Iraq.
"I think there is a general agreement about the central involvement of the United Nations," Mr. Blair said. "Now exactly how that process takes place is precisely the issue that we discuss, but there is a common view now, not just amongst the Europeans but also with the United States, that it is important that we have a new United Nations resolution that authorizes that and that governs not merely the humanitarian situation but also the post-Saddam civil authority in Iraq."
With the United Nations' role in postwar Iraq unclear, Security Council diplomats indicated after a meeting today that the oil-for-food program, which for the past few years has been the main source of food for 60 percent of the Iraqi population, should be revived under the temporary authority of Secretary General Kofi Annan. The program was effectively suspended on Monday when United Nations workers were pulled from Iraq.
Experts representing the 15 Council members are to meet Saturday to discuss Mr. Annan's March 19 proposal to reauthorize the program.
On Thursday, the European Union leaders signaled that they would resist an American-led administration for Iraq and in a joint statement called for the United Nations to play a central role.
But Mr. Chirac seemed to think that a Security Council resolution would make the United States and Britain the de facto governors of Iraq. He added, "France would not accept a resolution tending to legitimize the military intervention and giving the Americans and British the power to administer Iraq."
He said the United Nations was the only body that could take responsibility for rebuilding Iraq, underscoring that he is willing to consider some sort of resolution for rebuilding the country but not one that would seem to legitimize the war or give the United States and Britain exceptional powers.
"Whatever the results of the military operation," Mr. Chirac said, Iraq "must be rebuilt, and for that there is just one forum, the United Nations."
Later in Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said the United States was in contact with members of the Security Council "as to what is appropriate" for a postwar Iraqi authority.
"I hope that France will want to be a partner in such an effort, but that remains to be seen," Mr. Powell said. 
The leaders in Brussels wrapped up their meeting with a 36-page declaration that pledged to forge creative strategies to combat the global economic slowdown. Still, not all of the insults could be held back.
Britain, which has committed 45,000 troops to the Iraqi campaign, continued to hurl accusations that France sabotaged an effort to win international approval at the United Nations for the war.
The British foreign secretary, Jack Straw, refused to back off his verbal assault on France, which drew an angry protest from his French counterpart, Dominique de Villepin. "I stand by the words I have used," Mr. Straw told British reporters. "I don't regret the fact that we have argued."
Asked about the plan by France, Germany and Belgium to hold their own defense meeting, Denis McShane, Britain's senior official on Europe, told French reporters, "The idea of a European defense based on Belgium and without England? I wonder how serious this could be."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: AIRLINES; 
Hawaiian Files for Bankruptcy Amid Layoffs in Airline Sector

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
The nation's airlines, saying the war with Iraq had frightened travelers into staying home, announced deeper cuts in flight schedules yesterday and layoffs of 8,300 workers. Hawaiian Airlines, the nation's 12th-largest carrier, filed for bankruptcy protection.
 United Airlines, which itself filed for bankruptcy protection in December, said it was cutting its schedule by 8 percent because of a slump in bookings that preceded and accompanied the start of the war. Unions said United, the nation's second-biggest airline, after American Airlines, gave them notice yesterday that it was laying off 1,100 mechanics at its maintenance base in Indianapolis, and 2,300 flight attendants. 
 Northwest Airlines, the industry's fourth-biggest carrier, said yesterday that it would cut its schedules by 12 percent, including domestic and international flights, and lay off 4,900 employees, citing a drop in bookings related to the war. Northwest's cuts equal 11 percent of its work force of 44,000 people. 
Hawaiian Airlines is the third major airline in eight months to file for bankruptcy protection, joining United and US Airways. The airline, which had tried in recent months to refinance its aircraft leases, said it had more than $100 million in debt, along with $100 million in assets.
Analysts had predicted that carriers would lose $6 billion this year, even without a war. Should the war drag on, the airlines could lose $10.7 billion and be forced to cut 70,000 jobs, the Air Transport Association, the industry's trade group, predicted this month.
"The airline industry is facing today its biggest crisis that it's probably faced in the modern jet age," Douglas M. Steenland, Northwest's president, said in an interview yesterday.
Mr. Steenland and other industry executives say travelers' skittishness in advance of the war and during its outbreak was the primary reason for their cuts. On some days this week, Mr. Steenland said, Northwest's bookings were down 30 percent from the same day last year. On Wednesday, when the war began, US Airways' bookings fell 40 percent from levels a year ago, the airline said yesterday.
Northwest, in fact, invoked a clause in its contracts called force majeure, which allows airlines to act immediately in the event of national emergencies. The carriers last applied force majeure after the Sept. 11 attacks. 
But Kevin Mitchell, president of the Business Travel Coalition, which represents corporate travel departments and business travelers, said many passengers were not flying because their companies were cutting travel budgets. He said he suspected some of the carriers were using the war as a cover for reductions they should have made anyway, in response to slower air traffic since spring 2000.
"Clearly the war is sending some of them over the edge, but if they had addressed this two years ago, they wouldn't be in this condition," Mr. Mitchell said. "None of them can blame the war directly. It's the result of not stepping up to circumstances that have been in effect since 2000."
Across the industry, officials are voicing hope that traffic will recover quickly if a conflict is short. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a sunny forecast this week that travel would be up for 2003 from 2002 should the war be brief, though it acknowledged that a longer conflict would put that prediction at risk.
But Mr. Steenland said he doubted travelers would quickly begin flying again, even when the conflict ends. For one thing, corporations may be wary of sending managers out on the road right away, for safety and cost reasons, he said.
"Our best estimate, and it's only an estimate," he said, "is that the declines that we've seen are not going to immediately snap back, if and when the actual physical hostilities are finished. It will take some period -- we don't know how long for us -- to recover from the booking declines we've seen."
Domestic terrorism could make the situation worse, said Morten Beyer, founder of Morten Beyer & Agnew, an airline consulting firm in Arlington, Va. "If there's another incident of any kind, the fearmongers will go crazy and it will have a disproportionate effect on air travel," he said.
Northwest's layoffs will affect employees in all parts of the airline. As part of its cut, the airline will remove 20 planes from service and eliminate flights within the United States and to international destinations. A spokesman, Kurt Ebenhoch, said he could not estimate the number of flights that would be suspended, but said no cities would be eliminated from Northwest's schedule.
He said the cuts would be accomplished in three ways: by eliminating the least popular flights, switching to smaller aircraft and replacing nonstop flights with routes that require a connection. For example, Mr. Ebenhoch said, Northwest will reduce its weekly flights between its Detroit hub and Tokyo to 10 from 14. It is eliminating one of its daily flights from La Guardia to Detroit and one from La Guardia to Minneapolis, and reducing service to Minneapolis from Boston and Baltimore.
United did not say which American cities would be affected by its schedule cuts, but said it would reduce, but not eliminate, service to Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London, Tokyo, Paris, Brussels and Taipei, Taiwan. United yesterday began notifying employees at its Indianapolis maintenance base that they would be laid off, some through June 15, while others will be off the job until Aug. 15, said Joseph Tiberi, a spokesman for the International Association of Machinists. 
Glenn F. Tilton, chief executive of United's parent, the UAL Corporation, said yesterday in a recording for employees that United, which warned on Monday that it might be forced to liquidate if it did not obtain $2.56 billion in wage and benefit concessions, was determined to survive. 
But, Mr. Tilton said, "this time for us now is clearly the toughest and the most difficult of circumstances in United's history." Last week, Mr. Tilton warned that the airline might be forced to impose a 9 percent pay and benefit cut on all employees, because of the drop in travel accompanying fears of a war.
In a court filing Monday, United said its international bookings had dropped 40 percent. At a hearing in bankruptcy court yesterday, United's chief financial officer, Frederic F. Brace, said total bookings had slumped "a meaningful amount" but declined to state a number. 
Weaker traffic prompted Continental Airlines this week to cut its flights between the United States, Europe and Japan. It also said it would lay off 1,200 employees through the end of the year.
Hawaiian became the latest airline to join the bankruptcy group only weeks after reaching agreements with its unions on $15 million in annual contract concessions that it hoped could stave off a bankruptcy filing. Hawaiian had just completed a transformation of its aircraft fleet, retiring its remaining McDonnell Douglas DC-10 jumbo jets and focusing on Boeing 717 and 767 jets instead.
The airline, which has 3,311 employees, flies 135 flights a day, within the Hawaiian Islands, to the West Coast and to Tahiti and American Samoa. It has code-sharing arrangements with American Eagle, a subsidiary of American Airlines, and Alaska Airlines. 
The carrier announced a merger in December 2001 with its rival, Aloha Airlines, in a deal worth $200 million. But the arrangement, which was opposed by its unions and state officials, fell apart a year ago. Hawaiian said its parent, Hawaiian Holdings, was not included in the filing.
The airline said it would continue to operate its flights and planned no layoffs. In its court filing, it said its biggest creditor was Wells Fargo Bank, with an $11.3 million claim. 
John W. Adams, the airline's chief executive, said Hawaiian was forced to make the filing when it could not reach agreement on new terms with its airline leaseholders. He said the carrier hoped to emerge from bankruptcy protection by fall.

HEADLINE: Votes in 2 Chambers Back Bush Tax Cuts 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 21 

 BODY:
By a three-vote margin, the House early today approved a $2.2 trillion spending plan for the next fiscal year that would make room for the deep tax cuts President Bush proposed and lead to deficits for the rest of this decade.
 Later today, the Senate rejected a move to reduce the president's tax package by more than half, but the Senate postponed a final vote on its budget until next week. 
 The Senate did vote to reduce the $726 billion, 10-year tax cut the president wants by $100 billion and to hold the money in reserve to pay for the war against Iraq and its aftermath. The vote was not conclusive and could be overturned. 
The White House has not yet asked Congress to approve money for the war, and administration officials have refused to say how much it might cost. Republicans said the president did not want his tax cut jeopardized by concerns about war costs. But they said they expected him to make an initial request for money next week.
The House budget makes no allocation for the war or reconstruction costs.
The measures at issue are called budget resolutions. They are planning measures and do not carry the force of law. But the resolutions have some political significance because they establish general guidelines for the tax and spending legislation Congress will deal with for the rest of the year.
The tax provisions are especially important because they establish the amount the Senate can later consider in tax legislation under procedures prohibiting filibusters.
The House passed its version about 3 a.m. by a vote of 215 to 212. Voting in favor were 214 Republicans and one Democrat. Voting against it were 12 Republicans, 199 Democrats and one independent.
In the Senate, the 50 hours of debate allotted under rules expired Thursday night. The Senate spent all day today in what is known as a vote-a-rama, one vote after another on amendments with only a minute or so in between when the sponsor was permitted to describe the amendment. 
The only significant amendment approved today was one offered this morning by Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, that lowered the Bush tax cut to $626 billion and set aside $100 billion for war costs.
"We are in a war, and the budget must reflect it," Mr. Feingold argued.
Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, the chairman of the Budget Committee, responded that Congress had never financed wars in advance and that it was impossible to know now what this one would cost.
Three Republicans -- John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island -- joined Democrats in voting for the measure. At the end, the Republican leader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, also voted for the measure so that, under the rules, he would be free to move later to reconsider the vote and have a new one.
The two plans are quite different in their details. The differences will be worked out in a House-Senate conference committee.
Both plans would supposedly balance the budget eventually, the House plan in 2012 and the Senate measure in 2013. But they would achieve that balance with much tighter limits on spending in years ahead than the politicians have ever found acceptable when time came to put them into effect.
Democratic senators and representatives argued that it was ill advised to cut taxes in the face of war and large budget deficits. "The Republican budget is reckless and irresponsible," declared Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader. 
The deficits, said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the top Democrat on the Budget Committee, would "do devastating damage."
But Republican leaders in the House were able to hold their slim majorities in line by appealing for loyalty to the president.
At a closed meeting of Republican members on Thursday, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and other leaders said it was crucial not to hand the president an embarrassing defeat at the outbreak of the war.
The House Republican leaders also rewrote their plan to restore cuts planned for Medicare and to set aside $400 billion over 10 years for prescription drug coverage.
On the final vote early this morning, the leaders used their influence to engineer a few last-minutes switches that enabled their budget plan to prevail.
In the Senate, most of the tension all week revolved around an amendment to lower the allowable 10-year tax cut to $350 billion from $726 billion. The measure was offered by four senators, two Republicans and two Democrats, who call themselves moderates.
After considerable anguish, liberal Democrats who oppose any tax cut at all decided to support the amendment as the lesser of evils. That meant the outcome hung on the votes of two other senators who also want no tax cut -- Mr. McCain and Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina.
Mr. Hollings and Mr. McCain could not be persuaded to vote for the measure. So many of the liberal Democrats decided to vote against an amendment that was going to be defeated anyway, and it was rejected, 62 to 38.
Arguing in favor of the amendment, one of the sponsors, Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, declared that it was "reasonable and more balanced" than what the Republicans wanted.
"We are at war," Mr. Breaux asserted. "Cutting taxes at a time of uncertainty," he continued, is not a responsible course.
But Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, argued, "When those men and women come home from the battlefield, we want to grow the economy so those men and women will have jobs."

 GENERATIONS OF CAPTIVITY
A History of African-American Slaves.
By Ira Berlin.
Illustrated. 374 pp. Cambridge, Mass:
The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $29.95.
 IRA BERLIN has written what will undoubtedly become one of the indispensable books on North American slavery. "Generations of Captivity" traces the history of this dismal institution from its 17th-century origins to its 19th-century destruction in the maelstrom of civil war. He comes closer than any other contemporary historian to giving us an opportunity -- in a single, readable volume -- to come to grips with a subject very few of us wish to think about but which all of us surely need to consider: how millions of white Americans over the course of three centuries came to hold millions of black Americans in chattel bondage while managing to lose nary a moment's sleep over their complicity in this monstrous enterprise.
And a monstrous enterprise it certainly was. "Slavery, of necessity, rested on force," Berlin writes in his prologue, and he weaves together the critical, interrelated themes of "violence, power and labor." Chapter by chapter, he illuminates the changes that occurred in slavery over time. At any given moment, bondage meant different things to different people across the various regions of North America. Berlin's perceptive discussion of regional distinctiveness and his nuanced analysis of how slavery was transformed over the course of 300 years are two of his signal achievements.
Berlin, who teaches history at the University of Maryland, College Park, begins with what he calls the "charter generations." These 17th-century black settlers entered areas like Dutch New Netherland, the English Chesapeake, French Louisiana or Spanish Florida with an indeterminate status that only gradually evolved into slavery. Their debasement was driven by the European demand for workers who could be used to exploit the economic opportunities offered by the New World. But Berlin argues that the slaves who formed the core of these "charter generations" were often able to escape a bondage that had not yet rigidified into an all-encompassing institution. In Florida, for example, militia service offered slaves a pathway to freedom.
Their successors were not so fortunate. As money-making crops like tobacco sparked the growth of large-scale commercial agriculture, the "plantation generations" began to emerge in the Chesapeake region. What had once been a "society with slaves" was transformed into a "slave society," where the institution took its place "at the center of economic production." The arrival of tens of thousands of slaves in the late 17th century and early 18th century redefined the meaning of race, heightened the level of violence and led to "a sharp deterioration in the conditions of slave life." The Chesapeake plantations established a pattern for low-country South Carolina, Georgia and East Florida, with consequences that would extend deep into the 18th century.
Hope for the enslaved did not arrive until the American Revolution. In the South, thousands of slaves in the "Revolutionary generations" found freedom in the turbulence of war. In the North, Revolutionary ideology, the relatively small numbers of slaves and their marginal economic significance combined to produce eventual emancipation. But Southern masters held their ground, and with the restoration of peace they carried the plantation system west. In the lower Mississippi Valley, the Louisiana Purchase led to the dramatic growth of slavery in that region. "At the end of the Revolutionary era, there were many more black people enslaved than at the beginning," Berlin notes. The promise of the Revolution for the vast majority of slaves had come to naught.
The stage was now set for the "migration generations." From the late 18th century until the eve of the Civil War, slaves were caught in the vise of a mass movement Berlin refers to as a Second Middle Passage. More than one million slaves were transported from the Eastern Seaboard states to the cotton and sugar areas of the Deep South, a process "dwarfing the trans-Atlantic slave trade that had carried Africans to the mainland." Black families were regularly torn apart, and longstanding slave communities were devastated as traders sought to meet this voracious demand. "The internal slave trade became the largest enterprise in the South outside of the plantation itself," Berlin writes, "and probably the most advanced in its employment of modern transportation, finance and publicity."
Slaves fought back as best they could. They built new families in the developing regions and turned to Christianity as a faith that offered hope for eventual salvation. They used the critical leverage they possessed -- the masters' dependence on their labor -- to demand better living conditions, payment for work on Sundays and evenings, and the right to till their own gardens and raise poultry and livestock for their own use. "Despite their enormous power, slaveholders found such compromises prudent," Berlin notes, and slave men and women used the space they carved out for themselves to create a culture that reflected their religious and secular values. Their success in resisting the dehumanizing effects of their bondage is one of the few bright threads in the gloomy tapestry of slavery.
Slave owners, in the end, felt no guilt over what they had done and were doing. It was all part of God's plan, they told themselves, and they insisted that they -- the masters and mistresses -- shouldered the real burdens of slavery, looking out for a childlike people who needed white guidance and discipline. But then came the Civil War, and the slaves shattered their owners' illusions and wrote the final chapter in the tragedy that was the American slave system. They sought and gained their freedom by the tens of thousands as federal forces approached, and over 200,000 blacks served in the Union Army and Navy. It was "a social revolution of mammoth proportions," Berlin concludes, and black men and women were active agents in destroying the institution that had held them in bondage for so long.
Berlin has given us a moving, insightful account of slavery in the United States. Readers will not soon forget the story he has told, nor should they. We still live with the consequences of this institution, and we should understand what slavery meant to the generations of captivity who lived it.

 ALVA & IRVA
The Twins Who Saved a City.
By Edward Carey.
Illustrated. 207 pp. Orlando, Fla.:
Harcourt. $24.
 AN imaginary city: this is a time for such a vision, especially for New Yorkers, whose city has always been in flux, though perhaps never more painfully and self-consciously than today. Entralla, the fictitious metropolis at the heart of Edward Carey's second novel, exists not only in our imagination and in the pages of "Alva & Irva" (which serves as Entralla's one and only guidebook) but in the form of tiny plasticine models of its streets and houses, seen in the appealingly smudgy photographs that punctuate the novel. A re-creation of Entralla also appears in the story of "Alva & Irva," since the twins of the book's title are the designer and sculptor, respectively, of their native city in miniature.
What kind of city is Entralla? Like the photographs, it's smudgy and elusive, although it has the features of an all-purpose European metropolis, with examples of Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque and classical architecture, a ruined medieval castle at its summit and Napoleon Street as its central thoroughfare -- not far from the golden arches of McDonald's.
Entralla is shabby, unsung, a little quaint. It has trolley buses. (Then again, so does contemporary Zurich.) It has no language that we are permitted to glimpse, beyond the largely monosyllabic names of its citizens, which suggest a generalized, if northerly, Mitteleuropa. Earthquakes have always threatened the city, and one destroyed its 13th-century citadel, yet Entralla has no other history to speak of. The text contains no mention of world wars and -- no less puzzling, in view of the geography and history suggested by the city's street and family names -- no mention of Communism embraced or repulsed.
To evoke Europe's past and simultaneously to elude it is a tricky project, especially in these haunted times. But Carey writes with persuasive authority, and we are inclined to believe him. Entralla is old and charmingly forgotten; it is new and drab; it sports ancient monuments and high-rise apartment blocks and discarded hypodermic needles in its gutters. It is strangely familiar.
And Entralla has a Central Post Office, where Alva and Irva Dapps's parents meet as employees and fall in love over foreign stamps. Alas, Linas Dapps's passion for these stamps is his undoing. Fragile, dreamy Linas loves them so much that he begins stealing the letters that bear them. He is caught on the very day that Dallia, his wife, is giving birth to their twin girls. Linas collapses with a fatal heart attack, and in the aftermath the twins are raised by a mother fearful of every intrusion from beyond the confines of their home. This double heritage -- their mother's agoraphobia and their dead father's dangerous dreams of elsewhere -- is reflected in the increasingly complementary natures of Alva and Irva as they grow to maturity: Alva the outgoing, loquacious, daring one; Irva the cloistered, silent one, ultimately unable to step out of her own front door.
Like everyone in Entralla, the twins live with the fear of the earthquakes that make the city all the more precious in its fragility. Carey follows Alva and Irva's story through the thoroughfares and buildings that Alva frequents and the little house on Veber Street that is Irva's world. There, hoping to lure Irva out into Entralla, Alva assembles the precise measurements of the city for Irva to reproduce in plasticine.
Alva, walking through Entralla with a measuring tape; Irva, recreating the city on chipboard squares and in boxes -- will their mini-metropolis be sufficiently true and familiar to tempt Irva into a return to its larger, bustling twin? Or will their efforts be too late? Will one of Entralla's earthquakes render them worthless? The young women's knowledge of the city provides the book with a splendid climax that leaves Entralla forever in Alva and Irva's debt.
It all comes back to maps -- to the way that maps are both limitation and liberation, both the seed of dreams and their most literal and pedantic deflation. The emphasis on detail in Carey's sweetly detached, exact prose has forebears in the illuminated dreams of Borges and Calvino and Georges Perec -- and in Carey's first novel, "Observatory Mansions," which has its own idiosyncratic architectural preoccupations.
During the book's most memorable section, Alva's yearning to encompass the world leads her to Pig Mikel, a tattoo artist who decorates her entire body, from neck to ankle and along each arm up to the wrist, with a map of the globe in the hypsometric tints, which indicate height above and below sea level. When this long ordeal is complete, the earth's own contours clothe Alva so thoroughly that, as she points out, "I was unable to undress myself completely ever again."
By giving flesh to dreams -- as Alva does when exhibiting on her skin all the places she will never see, as Irva does in her plasticine city -- Carey leads us to places where the story's logic, consistent on its own terms, may be impossible outside the covers of a book. Yet, as life becomes ever more shocking, we may need more than ever the fantastic in literature to evoke the true and the terrible in what we are pleased to call everyday reality. 

Letter to an Unknown

Five centimeters, already Chinese,
in your mother's womb, pre-intellectual,
about sixty days. Sounds can see you,
music can see you. Fu Xu your father,
I introduce you to him, he is a painter
already saving for your education, preparing
to carry you on his shoulders to museums.
Zhu Ming your mother holds you close,
as it is possible to hold a being close,
rare as an Empress, Freudian Chinese therapist,
she will teach you the joys and sorrows
of writing Chinese. May you spend
many happy years washing ink from your hands.
You have made the Great Wall of China bleed.
Who am I? Something like a tree
outside your window: after you are born,
shade in summer, in winter my branches
heavy with snow will almost touch the ground,
may shelter deer, bear, and you.
 Stanley Moss

HEADLINE: Q & A; 
An Agent's Fee on Security Deposits

 BODY:
 Q -- When I moved into my co-op in September 2001, I had to put $14,000 in escrow because of a foreclosure 12 years ago. It was to be put into an interest-bearing account held by the managing agent. About 16 months after I moved into the building, the interest amounted to approximately $200. However, $140 of it was deducted by the managing agent and I received $60. There is nothing in the agreement that states that the managing agent should receive part of the interest. Is this legal? . . . Deanna Wenble, Manhattan.

A -- Edward T. Braverman, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that the bylaws of most co-op corporations provide that the board can establish conditions in connection with its approval of a prospective buyer. Based on the letter writer's financial history, it would not have been unreasonable for the board to require a security deposit to be held in escrow, establishing a fund to make up for any defaults on the proprietary lease.
 Mr. Braverman said that the state's General Obligations Law provides every rental tenant -- including a tenant-shareholder in a co-op -- with safeguards to protect security deposits and ensure that the deposit remains the property of the tenant. The law also requires that for rental of property containing six or more family dwelling units, the security deposit must be kept in an interest-bearing account. 
Mr. Braverman said that even if the agreement establishing the fund does not mention it, the statute states that the holder of the security deposit is entitled to an annual "administration expense" equal to one percent of the amount being held. Accordingly, he said, given that there are very low interest rates being paid on such accounts, and given that the managing agent is entitled to one percent per year of the amount on deposit, it would appear that the amount held by the managing agent is appropriate and legal. 

A Lender Loses A Stock Certificate

Q -- I am refinancing my co-op mortgage and have a commitment from a new lender. The lender holding my current mortgage discovered a week before the closing that it had lost my stock certificate and proprietary lease and needs to give me an affidavit so that the co-op board can issue a new certificate. I am exposed to losing my commitment. In addition, there is a cost to obtain the new stock certificate, and there is a requirement that the managing agent attend the closing -- at additional cost to me -- because I cannot obtain the original stock certificate and the new one will have to be handed over by an agent for the board. What recourse do I have against the current lender? . . . Thomas Molnar, Scarborough, N.Y.

A -- Kenneth R. Jacobs, a co-op lawyer with offices in Manhattan and Yonkers, said that according to most co-op loan documents, the lender has an obligation to deliver a borrower's stock and lease upon satisfaction of the loan. So, Mr. Jacobs said, the lender may very well be liable to the letter writer for any actual damages incurred because of the lender's inability to comply with the requirement.
"In our experience," Mr. Jacobs said, "lenders who have lost the certificate and lease for a loan will pay any reasonable additional charges the borrower may incur in replacing the original stock and lease." 
So, he said, the first thing the letter writer should do is advise the lender of any expenses incurred as a result of the loss of the documents and ask to be reimbursed. "If all else fails, the letter writer can seek compensation from the lender by filing an action in small claims court," Mr. Jacobs said.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 3-23-03: THE WAR AT HOME; 
The Anti-American Lifestyle

BYLINE:  By Fernanda Eberstadt; Fernanda Eberstadt is a novelist. "The Furies" will be published in September by Knopf.

 BODY:
In recent weeks, the e-mail messages from home have come flying. "Are you suffering from a lot of anti-Americanism?" "I worry your children might be getting a hard time at school. . . ."
 My husband and I don't live in Islamabad or even in Seoul. We live in rural France, whose president has just roused the Bush administration's fury by raising his own international coalition against the invasion of Iraq. 
 Americans are convinced that the French hate America every bit as much as many Americans hate the French. But the reality I've encountered is more interesting -- a France whose values are quite different from the anti-Americanism of Parisians in black 501 jeans and ponytails.
For the past five years, we have been living in a corner of the Mediterranean Pyrenees known as Roussillon. It is inhabited by French Catalan farmers, North African immigrants, pieds noirs who settled here after the French withdrawal from Algeria and a growing population of dropouts from northern France. There is little industry, double-digit unemployment, low crime and one of the highest National Front votes in the nation.
In many ways, our friends and neighbors in Roussillon subscribe to a global culture that is thoroughly Americanized. My children's classmates in their village school are named Megan, Bryan, Kevin -- names their parents can't actually pronounce. Their families live in gated communities with names like Le Malibu; those who can afford them drive S.U.V.'s. The kids watch dubbed "Rugrats" and "Scooby-Doo"; their older brothers and sisters, dressed in hip-hop baggies, hang out in the mall; the parents rent Bruce Willis DVD's and go to Tex-Mex restaurants on nights out. On my trips home, my friends beg me to bring back "the latest Nikes you can't get here yet." To most French people I know, America is the permanently self-regenerating source of the myths, heroes and cultic-objects they hold dear.
Yet while the French want to consume American culture the way Americans want to consume sushi and kung-fu movies, they don't want to be American, because being American implies to them a willful amnesia, a loss of familial and societal ties.
Among my friends in Roussillon, respect, stability, tradition and leisure rank high, while money and career come far below. Work is not a virtue in itself, and individualism is a dirty word. (I have watched a businessman cut short a meeting in order to run his mother to the supermarket.)
Lunch, however, is big. In Perpignan, our local capital, the snarliest traffic jam is at noon when politicians, doctors, lawyers and schoolchildren rush home to sit down to a three-course meal with their families.
French people, even if they cheat on taxes, prize a generous welfare state that provides the out-of-work with a decent standard of living and subsidizes small farmers to keep the countryside from turning either to strip malls or wilderness. France, to the French, is rich and civilized. America is richer and uncivilized. When people in Roussillon talk to me about America, they are talking about a roulette-wheel nation of scary extremes, where a Japanese exchange student can be shot dead for mistakenly ringing the door of a Baton Rouge homeowner. The French long ago had their religious wars: to them, a president who thinks the jury is still out on evolution is the beginning of unreason.
On a recent weekend, we drove up into the mountains to visit our friends M. and F. They live in Cathar country, where the medieval Albigensian heretics held their last stand against the armies of the Inquisition. Their farm is not far from the town where, more recently, a sheep farmer, Jose Bove, was jailed for dismantling a McDonald's in his campaign against "malbouffe."
It is still winter there. When we sit down to lunch, M. serves us sausages that she has made from the pigs whose bristly ears my children stroked last summer, followed by slices of belly from her lean, wild long-horned cows, which roam the mountains and find their own way home at night. There are leeks from their kitchen garden and, for dessert, preserved plums. It will be months before they see fresh fruit or spring vegetables.
M. and F. aren't hippie survivalists: F. was one of the officers involved in the mutiny against De Gaulle's decision to end the war in Algeria (which is why I have reduced his name to an initial). But when America sues the European Union countries to accept growth-hormone U.S. beef, people like M. and F. wonder if corporate capitalism isn't the weirdest of New Age religions.
The French and American governments are going to keep on fighting, because the choices matter. France, unlike most other European countries, would be a superpower if it only could and resents being strong-armed by the Bush administration. There is no reason that the French shouldn't love Eminem and Nikes but also hate genetically modified soybeans and the death penalty. There is room for more than one version of democratic capitalism, and the French interpretation, statist at home, multilateralist abroad, may well have a broad appeal to nations negotiating their own compromise between tradition and free trade.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION/RADIO; 
Chappelle's 'Show': A Successor to 'In Living Color'?

BYLINE:  By ELVIS MITCHELL 

 BODY:
DAVE CHAPPELLE isn't content just to play the race card; for his Comedy Central series, "Chappelle's Show," he shuffles the entire deck.
 What fuels this spotty but often funny sketch-comedy series is a kind of laid-back indignation, a refusal to believe that ignoring racial differences will make anyone's life better. Mr. Chappelle's on-air persona is calm and almost sleepy, but it's a demeanor that will unexpectedly pop with energy; the sketches seem to burst out of his angry subconscious, even if it's an anger that's only skin deep. 
 His audacity registers in sketches like the fake-umentary in his first show, about a blind white supremacist who overcomes his handicap and ascends to the leadership of the Ku Klux Klan. The man was born not only blind, however, but black. He just thinks he's white. (He actually blows the mind -- and entire body -- of one of his colleagues once this truth is revealed.) 
It was as pointed a jab at American ambition as I've seen on television in years, and it built toward a brilliant final joke, explaining why the man left his wife, that I won't give away here. Mr. Chappelle also makes use of the freedoms of cable; the n-word was mouthed so often in the sketch that it became aural wallpaper.
Chris Rock, on his series for HBO, used his cynical intelligence to make common-sense assessments of America's racial divide that could initially discomfit mainstream audiences before finally making them break down into laughter. Mr. Chappelle's approach is less cerebral -- he's intrigued by the tension between blacks and whites, and it fires up his free-floating insolence. It's here that he bridges the gap between Rock's show and other fast-moving comedy shows like "Mad TV." Between "Chapelle's Show" and Cedric the Entertainer's "Cedric" sketch series on Fox, it almost looks like a renaissance for African-American humor on television; it's been a long time since the cancellation of "In Living Color," and Mr. Chappelle comes close to the bruising hostility that Keenen Ivory Wayans brought to that show.
A sketch on reparations -- compensating African-Americans for slavery -- turned into a running gag on stereotypes. When the government begins payments, the dozing economy wakes up: sales of Escalades skyrocket and Fubu, after a merger with Kentucky Fried Chicken, becomes the world's biggest corporation. The idea was too broad -- Mr. Chappelle's sketches often seem to have been made by someone who's running to stay a step ahead of the authorities. But what the taped pieces lose in slickness, they make up for with a jagged energy, and they fling glancing blows that often leave a mark. In one, a newscast reported on a neighborhood rip-off in which African-Americans lined up to cash multimillion-dollar checks. The confused anchorman -- Mr. Chappelle in a blond wig and so much make-up that you were afraid he'd be asphyxiated -- asked why there were no banks in the ghetto. "Because banks hate black people," trilled the perky white correspondent.
"Chappelle's Show" is blessedly fast -- it's a half-hour blur with its star as the only consistent element. On the down side, the show is nearly as devoted to his breast obsession as it is to his take on racial stereotypes and archetypes. One episode featured "It's a Wonderful Breast," in which a young woman bemoaned being cursed with large breasts until she got a chance to see what things would be like if she didn't have them. (It turned out that even her female friends wouldn't like her.) The tag, a comment on the Magic Negro roles that have cropped up with alarming frequency in the last few years -- in films like "The Family Man" and "The Legend of Bagger Vance," where smiling black stars turn their charisma down to simmer while bailing whites out of jams -- almost made up for the sketch's crude sloppiness. Another episode had Mr. Chappelle, sporting what looked like an edible wax mustache from a trick-or-treater's bag and an equally goofball accent, prancing around Times Square and awarding giggly girls ribbons printed with the phrase "NY Boobs." (A taciturn Joe Rogan, host of NBC's "Fear Factor," accompanied Mr. Chappelle; he looked as if he was either holding Mr. Chappelle's medication or reminiscing about his own days on "Newsradio.")
Mr. Chappelle does introductions to the sketches in front of a live audience, descriptions that are more like opening remarks than a monologue. There are semi-regulars who can be half-glimpsed as supporting players, and there are pauses for hip-hop performers -- the musical guest list has included Mos Def and Busta Rhymes -- in remote segments taped without a studio audience. It's an idea almost as audacious as the white-supremacist sketch: it spares us the cliche of the audience raising the roof during the song, and it lets us concentrate on the artists' gifts -- we're allowed to appreciate the music on its own terms.
If pressed, Mr. Chappelle would probably admit that his show is a dashed-off autobiography. He flings off subtle bombs about his career to date, like a benign uppercut toward his sitcom experience on the condescending failure "Buddies," a 1996 show that treated a friendship between a black man and a white man like a feat comparable to landing Neil Armstrong on the moon. He used the word "ill-fated" as if it were part of the series' title: "the ill-fated 'Buddies'; just irrelevant." (He made a second career of ridiculing the sitcom for the better part of a year on "Late Night With Conan O'Brian.")
"Chappelle's Show" has more notions about television than it knows how to handle, like ribbing the crassness of QVC and taking shots at the all-attitude WB while outing the incipient racism of that network's ragtime mascot, Michigan J. Frog. Let's hope Mr. Chappelle doesn't jog away from "Chappelle's Show" as quickly as he did from "Buddies" -- it needs the concentration of a long-distance run rather than the hopping spurt of a high-hurdles sprint.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE; 
Canada's Most Fabulous House Makes a Comeback

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER HALL; Christoper Hall writes for Architectural Digest and Preservation magazine.

DATELINE: COMOX, British Columbia 

 BODY:
SURROUNDED by forest, glacial peaks and the cobalt waters of the Strait of Georgia, this comfortable Vancouver Island town of 12,000 is a popular center for outdoor recreation on the far western fringe of Canada. Visitors come to fish, hike, sail and ski, or simply to enjoy the spectacular scenery. No one comes expecting architectural treasure.
 But on a 200-foot seaside bluff just outside Comox, a midcentury Modernist house bears witness to the prodigious talent of its designer -- a once prominent figure in North American architecture who is largely unknown in the United States -- and to the tenacity of an owner who recently saved it. 
 Filberg House is an ethereal, glass-walled pavilion with undulating 14-foot ceilings and views that stretch across mountains, water and a seemingly infinite sky. The residence, hailed in a 1961 issue of Canadian Homes magazine as "the most fabulous house in Canada," was an important early project of Arthur Erickson, the globe-trotting Vancouver architect whose recent work includes the Museum of Glass that opened last July in Tacoma, Wash. 
Mr. Erickson designed the house in 1958 for Rob Filberg, the son and grandson of timber barons and a native of Comox, which is on Vancouver Island's eastern shore about four hours by car and ferry from the city of Vancouver.
"I'd known Rob before I was an architect and admired his sophistication," said Mr. Erickson, an urbane, silver-haired man of 78. "He wanted me to design something that would convey the beauty and spirit of the site to the outside world, since he hoped to make it an informal gathering place for international thinkers."
With an eye toward Frank Lloyd Wright, an early influence, Mr. Erickson conceived a light-filled house of strong horizontal lines set amid the trees and contours of a softly rolling 25-acre site. Slender steel columns supported a substantial roof that seemed to float, especially at night when lighted from underneath. The house stretched along a central east-west axis partly defined by a strip of skylight, with a sight line leading out and up to a small exterior deck perched above the surf like the bowsprit of a ship.
Inside, the main floor was given over to a kitchen, a dining room with a built-in terrazzo table and a large living room whose focal point was a freestanding brass fireplace. An upper-level balcony contained two bedrooms and a small den, and throughout the 2,500-square-foot house touches of African jewel wood, ribbon-grained mahogany and amber-toned fiberglass lent a feeling of warmth.
Most remarkable, perhaps, was the extent to which indoor and outdoor spaces merged, in part because of all the glass but also through architectural sleight of hand. Luminous terrazzo floors flowed uninterrupted from the living and dining rooms onto the terrace, and freestanding pink granite walls pierced the exterior glass curtain. In an exotic flourish, delicate latticework sunscreens, made of yellow cedar and reminiscent of a Moorish palace, cast identical shadows inside and out.
"Filberg House was an important work that was widely seen and published," said Nicholas Olsberg, director of the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal. Further house commissions eventually led Mr. Erickson to large, innovative projects that put his name on the international map, like Simon Fraser University outside Vancouver and the Canadian Pavilion at Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan. By 1979, when The New Yorker ran a 27-page profile of Mr. Erickson, the eminent American architect Philip Johnson declared him "by far the greatest architect in Canada, and maybe the greatest on this continent."
But Rob Filberg never lived in the house he commissioned. A troubled man who battled alcoholism and depression, especially after the scandalous break-up of his weeklong society marriage, he died in 1960, at 33, just months before the house was finished.
"It was profoundly sad that Rob never saw the completed house," Mr. Erickson said, adding that he had undertaken the commission in an attempt to save a man he considered a close friend. "The day before the funeral, a group of us went to the house, still mostly a construction site. It was spring, when the apple trees were blooming, and we collected blossoms and put them inside. That was when I first got the sense it was a real house."
The property sat vacant until it was purchased in 1962 by a married couple who lived there for more than 20 years, keeping it in architecturally pristine condition. In the 80's, it was sold to Noah Carpenter, a surgeon, who began a series of radical alterations after finding that the roof leaked and the winter wind blew through cracks in the walls. Skylights were covered, the brass fireplace was dismantled and the cedar sunscreens were removed with a chain saw and thrown near an outdoor burn pile. Glass walls were replaced with a stucco facade dotted with small doors and windows and painted pastel pink. According to Dr. Carpenter, who is of Inuit ancestry, the negative public attention eventually caused him to leave. "I was more snug and better loved in an igloo," he said.
In the early 90's, when the architectural photographer Simon Scott drove by the house, which he had photographed years earlier, he was horrified. "Instead of this wonderful glass jewel, I saw a stucco coffin," he said. "I took a couple of photos and showed them to Arthur. He was shocked, but there wasn't anything we could do."
Doug Field, a longtime Filberg House neighbor, also was shocked. "I didn't know much about Arthur Erickson then, but it was just terrible to see what was happening to such an amazing house," said Mr. Field, 53, a lanky Comox native who made his fortune manufacturing the BuzzBomb and Zzinger fishing lures. When the house came on the market in 1999, he bought it "for $450,000" -- Canadian dollars -- "and some land" and began a detailed restoration. "Most guys wouldn't want to do this," he said, "but I restore old cars and built my own house. I had the skills and financing to take on the project."
Within nine months, relying on his memory of the house, old photographs and a set of original plans, Mr. Field had effectively resurrected the architect's modernist vision, tearing out the stucco, installing new glass walls and rebuilding the fireplace. He did much of the work himself, including restoring all but one of the sunscreens, which hadn't been burned. He even introduced upgrades like double-pane windows, ceiling insulation and a modern kitchen.
Mr. Field's effort earned him an award from the Architectural Institute of British Columbia, but he seems most proud of Mr. Erickson's reaction. "He came out to see the house, and he was grinning the entire time he was here," said Mr. Field, who now lives in the house and hopes to remain there, though its fate is uncertain because of property-settlement issues surrounding his recent divorce proceedings.
As for Mr. Erickson, his recent history has been as turbulent as that of Filberg House. Worldwide recession, overspending and disorganized business practices forced him to close his far-flung offices and declare bankruptcy in 1992. (In his jet-setter heyday, he reportedly claimed that he had his hair cut only in Rome.) His own heavily mortgaged residence was rescued from developers by financial angels, and he now rents his home from a foundation. But in Mr. Olsberg's opinion, no one should write off Arthur Erickson. "In the last two years, he's made a comeback with the glass museum in Tacoma and the Waterfall Building, a mixed-use project in Vancouver," he said. "And there still is no one in Canadian architecture of his stature."
Mr. Erickson has reached a contemplative stage in his life and career, he said, writing his memoirs and considering the question of an architect's legacy, which so often rests with the owners of buildings. 
"Visiting Filberg House after so many years had passed was like seeing my history, my formative years, flash before me," he said. "What Doug Field has done there is miraculous."

When Japan Adopted The Camera as Its Very Own

BYLINE:  By VICKI GOLDBERG 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
WHEN Commodore Perry sailed into Japan the second time, in 1854, to conclude a treaty opening that country to the West, he brought the modern world to a land that was still feudal, that still fought wars with swords and that still manufactured almost everything by hand. In astonishingly short order, the Japanese began adopting and adapting technologies and Western ways. A struggle began -- it has never entirely ceased -- to achieve a balance between Western modernity and Japanese tradition.
 Aboard one of Perry's ships was a photographer, who brought with him a revelation that the Japanese would assimilate, accommodate and change. Japanese photographers, taught by Westerners, soon documented their country's momentous journey into a new epoch. 
 By the early 20th century, the art of Japanese photography would be internationally recognized, only to be in effect forgotten by the rest of the world as Japanese militarism rose in the 1930's. In the 1970's, Japanese photography reappeared in the West, but no exhibition ever addressed its history comprehensively, even in Japan. One Japanese curator said that tracking his own country's photographic history would be like asking fish to analyze water. 
But now "The History of Japanese Photography" at the Museum of Fine Arts here provides an eye-opening introduction to photographic and Japanese history in more than 200 pictures. Most of these images are entirely unknown here, and Anne Wilkes Tucker, the museum's curator of photography, said that what with earthquakes, fires and wars, some 75 percent of them are unique or one of two surviving prints. Make no mistake about it: it isn't often that this much new material illuminating this much history comes over the horizon.
The story of how photography was absorbed into non-Western societies and how styles and subjects were reconfigured by cultural differences has yet to be written. In Japan, unsurprisingly, photography began with portraits; as factories were founded and urban centers grew, the new middle class acquired the privilege of owning its own image. Camera portraits were considered so truthful that brothel patrons would select bed partners from photographs.
The culture elastically reshaped portraiture. Small images were enclosed in wooden cases; samurai posed with their legs spread wide; an old woman might be seated in profile off at the edge in a large, blank space; one photographer pictured himself, before 1870, with a great open-mouthed smile, an expression virtually unknown in photography elsewhere at that date. In one startling image by Matsusaburo Yokoyama, a hand-colored photograph of a Japanese man is held by a painting of a fellow who appears to be Caucasian, in a space occupied by paintings of two palettes and a framed picture.
The progress of Westernization was written on citizens' backs: some men posed in kimonos with Western shoes or hats or furled umbrellas. In 1872, the first picture of the Emperor Meiji showed him in traditional garb; the next year he wore a fancy, Western-style military uniform. This second picture was distributed to public offices and schools, and though private sales were prohibited, photographers rushed to copy and sell it. General circulation of the emperor's image simply did not exist before.
There was one market for foreigners, another for Japanese. Tourists particularly liked hand-colored images (some in melting, candy-box hues), and famous sites, picturesque poor folk, samurai (dashingly imitated by actors after samurai were outlawed) and geishas (usually prostitutes gussied up above their station).
Landscape, that staple of Japanese art, followed close behind portraiture. Some landscapes, panoramas especially, were mounted on paper scrolls with silk borders, a practice that, so far as the curators can tell, is unknown anywhere else. (In addition to Ms. Tucker, the curators are Dana Friis-Hansen of the Austin Museum of Art, Ryuichi Kaneko of the Nagoya City Art Museum and Joe Takeba of the Museum of Photography in Tokyo). These mounted landscapes must have been a new sensation for the viewer, too. Scrolls, which are unrolled with one hand while being rerolled with the other, are generally narrative and experienced over time, like a book or a movie. A set view of a harbor is a different thing altogether.
Then, too, vanishing-point perspective, though it was known from Western paintings, had been largely dismissed by Japanese painters, so photography presented a new way of regarding space. Still, photographers sometimes picked viewpoints that blocked receding perspectives and ironed space into a semblance of Japanese painting.
The government quickly understood the uses of documentary photography, commissioning pictures of the Japanese islands and of cultural treasures in the 1870's and 80's. Photographic records kept the emperor and officials up to date; photographs were distributed to the populace to remind them of how effective the government was. When Japan waged war against China in 1894 and Russia in 1904, widely published photographs contributed to public awareness that what was once a collection of warlike fiefdoms had become a unified (and powerful) nation-state. Though cameras could not yet capture battle action, pictures of destroyed enemy ships and dead enemy soldiers sang loud enough of war and victory.
In the 1890's, when the Japanese embraced photography as art, they embarked on that worldwide, soft-focus style, Pictorialism, initially taking delicate landscapes almost exclusively. A show of British Pictorialist photographs visited Japan in 1893; two years later, the Royal Photographic Society of England elected a Japanese to its fellowship. Pictorialism continued into the 1930's, producing along the way dazzling images like Gesshu Ogawa's "Doro Gorge," in which a man floats, on a raft of logs that trail after him like a path cut into the water, between looming cliffs in a grainy sepia world. Mitsugi Arima's "Picture of Gourds," exquisitely empty and barely anchored in space, epitomizes the melancholy beauty of ephemeral things that had long permeated Japanese art. 
After the devastating 1923 earthquake, Tokyo was given a new, modern face and photography spawned an avant-garde. Japanese photographers showed in European salons, studied in Europe and America, even at the Bauhaus, and knew Russian revolutionary photography. In 1931 a version of "Film und Foto," the landmark show organized in Germany, went to Japan. Photographers tried out collage, montage, photograms, social realism, abstraction, surrealism. Teiko Shiotani turned his "Landscape With Weather Report" into a cosmic seascape, where the horizon curves as sharply as a globe, by the exceedingly rare method of bending the paper during developing. Gingo Hanawa's "Complex Imagination" is a troubling image of a half-nude woman behind a metal grid, one eye invaded by a real metal hook affixed to the picture, her stomach cut away to reveal real metal gears.
As Japanese militarism and home-front repression advanced in the 1930's, the avant-garde retreated. The government, already aware of how useful photography could be as propaganda during a war, published an illustrated magazine in four European languages beginning in 1934, three years after occupying Manchuria. During World War II, photojournalism was almost entirely at the government's service.
After the war, the arts returned, and social observation returned with a vengeance. Western influence was strong -- Henri Cartier-Bresson, William Klein -- but in a country roiled by an American occupation, then disoriented by hurtling economic development and Westernization, photography was literally and figuratively dark. Shomei Tomatsu's well-known "Beer Bottle After the Atomic-Bomb Explosion" -- one of the few familiar images in the show -- looks like a flayed and gleaming carcass strung up against a wasted wall. Masatoshi Naito pictured a more innocent subject, a group of jolly grandmothers, as a line of threateningly gleeful heads looming up from blackness, eagerly baring dangerous metal teeth.
In the 1990's, when much more Japanese photography was shown in the West, the Japanese were as postmodern and experimental as anyone. Female photographers, rare in that country's history, leaped into the fray. Miwa Yanagi's "White Casket" is a series about red-uniformed "elevator girls" -- those physically perfect and impossibly innocent department-store hostesses -- gradually dissolving into a pool of blood. 
Even today, tension exists between modernization or Westernization and tradition. Yasumasa Morimura's role-playing as Brigitte Bardot or as all the figures in a Rembrandt painting raises both gender questions and East-West questions: how does a Japanese artist fit into the Western tradition? And in a culture that traditionally put the community before the individual and erected strong fences around personal matters, the Western penchant for self-disclosure has also become firmly, if sometimes scandalously, entrenched. 
Nobuyoshi Araki, who is known in the West for his many photographs of young nude women, often in bondage, is better known in Japan for his photographic journals of his honeymoon in the 1970's and his wife's death in the 1990's. His nudes, which got him arrested, encouraged other photographers to buck social and legal strictures. His public disclosures of private matters raised a storm but gave a younger generation permission to focus on themselves. He is so famous that three sumo wrestlers once stopped him on the street to ask for his autograph; imagine major league baseball players recognizing a photographer on an American street and whipping out their autograph books.
This show, jointly organized by the Museum of Fine Arts and the Japan Foundation, opens a path that future historians will doubtless widen. The need for it is highlighted by comparison to a history of world photography that Ms. Tucker herself andDaniel Wolf put together in 1989. There was not one Japanese photograph in it. We may sit tall, but the view from here is not always panoramic.

HEADLINE: They Both Reached for the Gun 

BYLINE:  By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
TO see why "Chicago" became the movie of the year in a year when America sleepwalked into war, you do not have to believe it is the best picture of 2002 (mine would be Almodovar's "Talk to Her"). Nor must you believe that musical comedy is making a comeback in Hollywood (it's barely holding its own on Broadway, where even "Hairspray" has empty seats). All you have to do is watch a single scene.
 That scene is a press conference in 1920's Chicago. A star defense attorney, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), wants to browbeat a mob of reporters into believing that his client, Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger), did not murder her lover when in fact she did. "Now remember," Billy coaches Roxie, "we can only sell them one idea at a time." The idea: Roxie acted in self-defense. "We both reached for the gun," Roxie sings to the reporters, who obediently turn her lie into a rousing chorus, repeating it over and over in a production number that portrays them as marionettes, bowing and scraping to the tug of Billy's strings and spin. 
 For history's sake, this spectacle should be paired on the DVD with George W. Bush's fateful White House press conference of March 6, 2003. This was the president's first prime-time faceoff with reporters since a month after 9/11 and certain to be his last in what remained of peacetime. The former Andover cheerleader had failed to convince America's friends to come aboard. The economy was tanking. But the journalists at hand were so limply deferential to the president's boilerplate script that the subsequent, good-natured "Saturday Night Live" parody couldn't match the gallows humor of the actual event.
One reporter, April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks, asked, "Mr. President, as the nation is at odds over war, how is your faith guiding you?" -- a God-given cue for Mr. Bush to once more cloak his moral arrogance in the verbal vestments of humble religiosity. "My faith sustains me because I pray daily," came the president's reply. "I pray for peace, April, I pray for peace." Far be it from Ms. Ryan to ask a follow-up question about why virtually every religious denomination in the country, including Mr. Bush's own, opposes the war. She might as well have been Mary Sunshine (Christine Baranski), the sob sister reporter in "Chicago," who tosses Roxie an image-burnishing softball at her press conference by asking, "Do you have any advice for young girls seeking to avoid a life of jazz and drink?"
At Mr. Bush's sedated show there were no raised voices, not a single query about homeland security or Osama bin Laden. As Billy Flynn says, one idea at a time is enough for the journalistic pack -- in this case the administration's idee fixe of Iraq. And like their "Chicago" counterparts, the Washington press corps were more than willing to buy fictions if instructed to do so by the puppeteer. "Eight times Mr. Bush interchanged the war on Iraq with the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001," wrote The New York Observer, "and eight times he was unchallenged." The unproven but constantly reiterated White House claim of a Qaeda-Saddam Hussein connection has now become a settled fact, not to be questioned at a press conference any more than any "Chicago" reporter challenges the mythical pregnancy Billy Flynn flogs in his propaganda campaign to save Roxie Hart. 
The movie's press conference ends with Billy Flynn's message spreading from the servile reporters' lips directly to the next morning's paper: "THEY BOTH REACHED FOR THE GUN" is the banner headline we see rolling off the press. At Mr. Bush's press conference, under the guise of "news," CNN flashed the White House's chosen messages in repetitive rotation on the bottom of the screen while the event was still going on -- "People of good will are hoping for peace" and " 'My job is to protect America.' " No less obliging were the puppets at CNN's rival, Fox News, whose Greta Van Susteren sharply observed: "What I liked tonight was that in prime time he said to the American people, my job is to protect the American people." Though Mr. Bush usually appears on TV in front of White House backdrops stamped with the sound bite he wants to pummel into our brains, this time he didn't even have to bother. As he knew -- and said, in his one moment of truth that night -- the entire show was "scripted." It has been from the start.
That "Chicago" should catch the wave of an American moment in 2003 is remarkable when you consider that its roots go back to a Broadway play of 1926. Coolidge was in office when it had its premiere at the Music Box Theater under the direction of George Abbott -- more than a year before the arrival of the most famous stage incarnation of Chicago city rooms, "The Front Page." "Chicago" was the first and only durable work by Maurine Watkins, a one-time Chicago Tribune reporter who had covered the Leopold-Loeb case and served as a movie critic. She was not enamored of her former profession. "They're awful dumb, reporters. Never get anything right," says the jail matron in a line that is paraphrased by Billy Flynn in Bill Condon's current screenplay.
When Watkins's play was reborn as a Bob Fosse musical on Broadway in 1975, it was seen as reflecting the cynicism of Watergate; the onstage band played a sardonic "Battle Hymn of the Republic" at the finale. When the musical was revived in 1996 -- in the production still running on Broadway -- Billy Flynn was identified with Johnnie Cochran and Roxie with O. J. Simpson. This year Miramax, the studio that produced the film "Chicago," is trumpeting the movie's social relevance in one of the relentless commercials of its Oscar campaign. The movie is "all about American institutions being corrupt," says its director, Rob Marshall, as we see black-and-white photographs of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and of the disgraced Richard Nixon's departure from the White House.
That doesn't sound much like fun. But as concocted by Mr. Marshall, "Chicago" is nasty, clever fun. The director is a bit of a Billy Flynn in his own right. He has edited the movie within an inch of its life -- or, more accurately, within an inch of Ms. Zellweger, Mr. Gere and Catherine Zeta-Jones's feet. You're never quite sure if the stars can really dance or if the dazzling montage is merely spinning the brilliant illusion that they can. But if the film is a "flimflam flummox," to quote its anthem, "Razzle Dazzle," that stylistic shell game could not be in more apt unison with the cynical content.
No one expected "Chicago" to become this big a hit (including me, though I've known two of its executive producers since they optioned a book of mine pre-"Chicago"). The movie's domestic box office is now double that of "Moulin Rouge," the only other movie musical to fly in years, and, unlike that predecessor, "Chicago" didn't have to throw in David Bowie and Beck to entice the musical-phobic youthful demographic thought to spurn show tunes by John Kander and Fred Ebb. Young audiences have turned up anyway. Everyone has. The film has touched a nerve this year as no previous incarnation of Watkins's play (there were two previous film versions) ever did.
In a case of life imitating art imitating life, "Chicago" is even mirrored in the year's juiciest Oscar scandal. Miramax, no wiser for fielding a TV ad trumpeting the Watergate bona fides of "Chicago," was caught in its own Watergate last week by John Horn of The Los Angeles Times. He reported that a publicist for the studio was the real author of a widely promoted OpEd piece carrying the byline of the director Robert Wise, now 88, endorsing Martin Scorsese as best director for another Miramax nominee, "The Gangs of New York." In angry response, some Academy voters demanded their ballots back so they could cancel their Scorsese votes -- a mission as doomed as the reballoting demanded by Palm Beach County's hapless Pat Buchanan voters. No matter: Mr. Scorsese has lost anyway, even if he wins. His would-be benefactor, Miramax's Harvey Weinstein, has made him look craven.
Such Oscar battles are welcome comic relief when set against the backdrop of a real-life war. Which is not to say that this year's Oscar nominees don't take war seriously. In Roman Polanski's World War II drama, "The Pianist," a Nazi is moved to save a Jew's life after the Jew, starving and half-dead, plays an exquisite Chopin nocturne at the piano. This sentimental notion of art's transcendence uber alles was echoed early last week in the vow by the Oscars' producer, Gil Cates, that the show (if not the red carpet) would go on tonight no matter what. After all, the Academy considered and rejected the notion of canceling in the aftermath of Pearl Harbor. Should Mr. Cates have reversed himself by now, he will have committed the cardinal Oscar sin of good taste.
It's hard to picture George W. Bush fretting about the fate of the Academy Awards, let alone seeing "Chicago," but he knows his westerns. Last weekend Vice President Cheney spoke admiringly to Tim Russert of how the president "cuts to the chase." In the Azores last Sunday, Mr. Bush instructed his erstwhile allies to "show your cards when you're playing poker." On Monday night, he gave the Hussein gang 48 hours to get out of Dodge. In the days to come, we just may finally learn who is brought back dead or alive.

HEADLINE: THEATER; 
The Magic of Ancient Japan Onstage

BYLINE:  By CAROL MARTIN; Carol Martin's most recent book is "Brecht Sourcebook" with Henry Bial. She is an associate professor of drama at New York University.

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
WITHIN the realm of myth a certain kind of truth can be revealed. So believes the Japanese director Satoshi Miyagi, whose production of "The Castle Tower" will have its American premiere Thursday through Saturday at the Japan Society in New York.
 The story of this popular Japanese play is simple enough. A young man, a mortal, is sent to the mythical Shirasagi castle to quell the mysterious spirit of the beautiful Princess Tomi. She reigns over witches and ghouls who feast on the skulls of samurai warriors they have killed. Soon he and the princess form an attachment that propels them on a path of impossible love. 
 The production, however, is far from simple. Mr. Miyagi, 44, is part of a younger generation of Japanese directors who are adapting traditional Japanese theater techniques to both Japanese and Western literature as a way to explore new approaches to performance and text. His signature style divides the performance between what he refers to as Logos (and defines as the narrator or speaker) and Pathos (the performer or mover): two actors perform each character; one enacts the words while the other speaks them. In addition, Mr. Miyagi uses two other theatrical devices: the spectacular excesses of classical Japanese theater and the live accompaniment of traditional and contemporary Japanese music. This aural landscape -- computer-generated sound, Chinese kokyu (a stringed instrument) and sanshin (an Okinawan stringed instrument that is the origin of shamisen) -- adds to the density of the performance. The total effect is otherwordly, as the elaborately costumed nonspeaking performers at the center of the stage deliver choreographically precise gazes and gestures in tandem with the Japanese words spoken by actors at either side of the action. (There will be English-language supertitles at all performances.)
The play itself, "Tenshu Monogatari" in Japanese, is by Kyoka Izumi, who was born in 1873 and died in 1939 -- a period in which Japan was rapidly absorbing Western influences. Yet Izumi, a novelist, short-story writer and playwright, often employed a form of folk narrative filled with fantasy and superstition. The novelist Yukio Mishima likened him to "a peony garden sending forth blossoms in the desert of modern literature." Izumi believed that his world needed to be reinvested with a magic that was threatened as Japan modernized. His more than 200 works have influenced modern Japanese literature, helping to preserve a sense of premodern language and cultural sensibility. 
It is Izumi's connection to the past that is important to Mr. Miyagi. This nostalgia for an older Japan, before its possibilities were foreclosed by Westernization, can be found among a number of younger Japanese artists today. So, for example, "The Castle Tower" provides an opportunity not only to stage a visual feast, but also to explore the ways in which love that cannot be realized, Mr. Miyagi said, "lets us see what love might be without social constraints." By using mythological figures, he added, society can be examined. 
In an interview this winter at a Tokyo hotel near his apartment, Mr. Miyagi elaborated, through an interpreter: "Within the complex system of Japanese modernism, it became very hard to imagine a language to express an authentic emotional experience. If I touch something and it's hot, it generates something in my body. It used to be the same with language. Language came from physical experience. But modernization severed the word from the body."
Speaking intensely, his small frame contained yet animated, he used examples from ancient Japanese poetry, Western literary classics and traditional and pop Japanese culture to illustrate his points.
The separation of language and experience can make acting difficult if not impossible. How can actors create characters by trying to integrate physical and verbal expression when words and gestures no longer have a relationship? "Pretending there is no such problem," Mr. Miyagi said, "is asking the audience to evade a very important issue in communication."
" 'I love you,' " he continued, "no longer means anything because the physical sensation of love is not part of the expression. I want to make audiences aware that words should come from the body. Language needs the body and the body needs language. We must be able to remember that love is the place where one can forgive and where one feels celebrated."
Inspired by an 18th-century version of the Japanese puppet theater Bunraku, in which two actors perform each role, as well as the solo storytelling form, Rakugo, Mr. Miyagi's theatrical solution to the actors' dilemma is to have dual performers for each character. The movements of the nonspeaking actors are reminiscent of puppet theater: there is a sense of positioning and placement, using controlled and stylized gestures, rather than fluidity. Mr. Miyagi said he aims to create the illusion of a world beyond human reality -- one of magic and myth.
His theater company, Ku Na'uka ("toward science" in Russian), was founded in 1990. He chose a Russian name, he said, because his hero at the time was Mikhail Gorbachev, the Russian leader who was experimenting with the "rational ability of men being able to govern men."
Mr. Miyagi and the 13 actors in the production of "The Castle Tower" were invited to New York, said Paula Lawrence, the director of performing arts at the Japan Society, because the production is a "startlingly original" version of one of the best-known modern Japanese plays. 
"Western audiences are ready to be introduced to theater inspired by Japanese themes and to Japanese literature," Ms. Lawrence said. "They can appreciate the universal in works of other cultures, not only Western classics. This is a rare opportunity to see a Japanese production of a modern Japanese play."
Rare indeed. Just as mainstream American audiences frequently shun things foreign, it can be easy for university drama departments in the United States to ignore anything that is not Western. Knowledge of Asian forms is not yet what it should be in a country that espouses a global outlook. Until recently, the study of theater in Asia was equally unbalanced, with a greater emphasis on Western plays and acting styles than on Asian traditions.
For Mr. Miyagi's generation, the West is the source of a global culture and economy that have damaged the way human beings communicate and destroyed indigenous arts. As a result, there is an increasing sense among some younger Asian artists that points of reference should be Asian-centric.
One of the more provocative signs of this attitude can be seen in outfits for sale in Harajuku, a fashion district in Tokyo devoted to youth culture. Here, the most popular garments are assemblages of reconstructed used clothing that often bear logos of American sports teams and colleges.
This dismembered look (the sleeves, front and back of a garment all coming from different sources) is a street fashion that in effect takes an idea of the United States and reassembles it in a way that effaces and subsumes the original design.
What remains is a Japanese statement about the possibility of containing or reconfiguring American dominance. This dismantling and reassembling is exactly what Mr. Miyagi is doing: by separating language and action, he is attempting to show the ways in which they were once fundamentally related.
Though "The Castle Tower" was written in 1917, its first production was not until 1951. Izumi never got to see his play produced; he offered to pay actors to perform it, but they considered it too strange. Since the 1960's, however, avant-garde Japanese directors like Tadashi Suzuki have staged Izumi's work. (Mr. Miyagi's "Castle Tower" had its premiere in 1996 at Mr. Suzuki's Toga Festival.) And even the celebrated Kabuki onnagata (female impersonator) Bando Tamasaburo has played Princess Tomi in a film version he directed and on the stage.
Mr. Miyagi's production focuses on Izumi's romantic belief that truth can be revealed in the depiction of magical worlds. His fantastic vision in spite of, or perhaps because of, his resolutely chosen Japanese sensibility, values a universal truth to which everyone can aspire. Izumi's message, Mr. Miyagi said, "is that all human beings should have the memory of originally being profoundly beautiful."

The Ku Na'uka production of "The Castle Tower" will be making two other stops: the Hopkins Center in Hanover, N.H., on April 2 and 3, and the Eddy Theater in Pittsburgh on April 6.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN; 
Orlando

BYLINE:  By SARA KENNEDY; SARA KENNEDY lives in Tampa.

 BODY:
Despite a soft economy and security fears that continue to discourage travel, Orlando still manages to lure millions of visitors to Florida. But there has been some erosion. The number of air travelers has been declining since it peaked in 2000 at a record 30.8 million arriving and departing air passengers, according to Carolyn Fennell, director of public affairs for the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority. In 2001, that number dropped to 28.3 million; last year, the number declined further to 26.7 million. (The airport's count obviously does not reflect Orlando visitors who arrived via other means, like car, train or bus.)
 In response, theme parks -- the engine of Orlando tourism -- are coming up with new attractions, services and pricing plans. Among the newest offerings are the Shark Deep Dive at SeaWorld, in which guests protected by an underwater cage mingle with the deep's most fearsome creatures; a lavish new Universal hotel with a 12,000-square-foot swimming pool; and, away from the parks, the 1.2-million-square-foot Mall at Millenia. 
 In their efforts to be more user-friendly, parks are selling more-flexible tickets that allow guests to cross easily among related parks and are expediting wait lines. A four-day Park Hopper pass to Walt Disney World covers admission with tax to the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom and Disney-MGM Studios, $210.94; ages 3 to 9, $168.54; under 3, free. SeaWorld Orlando and Universal Orlando together offer a Four-Park Orlando Flex Ticket, 14 consecutive days' admission to Universal Studios, Islands of Adventure, SeaWorld Orlando and Wet 'n' Wild-Orlando, $187.39 with tax; ages 3 to 9, $152.25, under 3 free. 

Events
 The Orlando-UCF Shakespeare Festival now has a permanent home at the John and Rita Lowndes Shakespeare Center, at Loch Haven Cultural Park, 812 East Rollins Street, (407) 447-1700, fax (407) 447-1701. Playing through March 30 is a one-man thriller, "The Island of Dr. Moreau," drawn from the H.G. Wells classic and starring Richard B. Watson. Tickets, $20 to $28 ($5 student discount) at the box office or www.shakespearefest.org. 
 The Festival of Orchestras presents the National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland, at the Bob Carr Performing Arts Center, 401 West Livingston Street, (407) 849-2000, April 5 at 8 p.m. Tickets $38 to $71, through Ticketmaster, (407) 839-3900, or at the Orlando Centroplex Box Office, 600 West Amelia Street, (407) 849-2020, or by visiting www.orlandocentroplex.com. 
 On April 5 and 6, the free Spring Arts and Crafts Festival takes place in Lake Eola Park, at Robinson Street and Eola Drive, downtown Orlando, (407) 246-2827, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. It features 200 sellers of eclectic items like ceramics, paintings, photography, handmade jewelry and clothing, photography and stained glass. Jazz bands entertain while vendors sell turkey legs, barbecue sandwiches, hot dogs and burgers.
 Orlando's NBA team, the Magic, faces Minnesota Thursday, Philadelphia March 31, Toronto April 9 and Boston April 12, all at 7 p.m. in TD Waterhouse Center, 600 West Amelia Street, (407) 849-2020, fax (407) 849-2329. Tickets, $10 to $90, at the box office, or www.orlandocentroplex.com.

Sightseeing
 SeaWorld's Shark Deep Dive puts guests underwater in a sturdy metal cage among more than 50 sharks in a 660,000-gallon saltwater tank; the park provides wet suits, gloves, weight belts and snorkels. Two may occupy the cage at a time, usually for 30 minutes. The dive costs, with tax, $125 or $150, depending upon whether you use snorkel or scuba gear; the cost includes two-day park admission. One-day, one-park SeaWorld admission with tax, $51.95; ages 3 to 9, $42.95; under 3 free. 7007 SeaWorld Drive, (800) 327-2424, (407) 351-3600.
 If that's not enough of a thrill, daredevils can take a cue from Atlanta Braves pitchers, at Disney's Wide World of Sports for spring training through March 31, some of whom spend their free time driving real stock cars at Disney's Richard Petty Driving Experience. There on the one-mile track at Walt Disney World Speedway, participants ride with a professional driver, or after instruction, rocket around a banked track following an instructor's car at speeds up to 145 miles an hour.

Short-Shorts at 35,000 Feet

BYLINE:  By JULIE BOSMAN 

 BODY:
On the airline's maiden voyage from Atlanta to Myrtle Beach, there was no mistaking the company's distinct identity. For starters, the tail fin of the Hooters Air Boeing 737 was painted with the wide-eyed owl that is the chain's mascot. Hooters orange was everywhere, from tray tables to overhead compartments to the silk scarves neatly knotted around the flight attendants' necks -- even on passenger safety manuals. In case anyone had forgotten who their host was, above the plane's entrance an enormous decal displayed the telephone reservation number, 1-888-FLY-HOOT.
 Hooters has taken to the air. The restaurant chain known for its buffalo wings and buxom waitresses has launched a small airline that will shuttle travelers between Atlanta and Newark to Myrtle Beach, S.C, several times a week. 
But anyone flying just for the girls might be disappointed -- our smiling hostesses in tank tops and short-shorts were kept mostly on the sidelines. They were Cameron Brooks and Hillary Vinson, age 21 and 22 respectively, and they stayed in the back of the plane for most of the flight while the actual flight crew, in classic navy-blue uniforms, briskly served food and drinks. Officially, the hostesses are on board to provide "entertainment and customer service," which includes handing out brochures. (Of course, their trips up and down the aisle provided generous flashes of thigh for interested parties.)
 It might seem odd that anyone would start an airline now, given the weak economy and jitters about terrorism. But Robert H. Brooks, chairman of Hooters of America, says that he believes this is a fine time to expand the 20-year-old Hooters franchise. 
 "This is a good time to get in -- when everybody's getting out," Mr. Brooks said before the inaugural flight on March 6. At a time when air travel is filled with anxiety and headache, Brooks is determined to make flying fun again. 
 It's a limited venture -- so much so that it may seem more a publicity gimmick than a serious airline. Hooters Air will serve only Newark, Atlanta and Myrtle Beach. Fares between Atlanta and Myrtle Beach are $129 one way, with an introductory round-trip fare of $99 until April 6. Service on the Newark routes is expected to begin in early April and will cost $159. Only four round-trip flights a week are currently running.
 As the flight neared its end, Ms. Brooks (no relation to the chairman) and Ms. Vinson strode to the front of the plane and grabbed the microphone. 
 "Y'all having fun?" asked Ms. Vinson, to cheers and applause. With Ms. Brooks assisting, she led the passengers in a quick Hooters-history trivia game. On the ground, the two offered perky "buh-byes" as passengers filed off the plane and posed for photos taken by (mostly male) souvenir hunters.
 Don't expect better-than-average airplane food. Quality buffalo wings are impossible to prepare on a plane, the company discovered. So passengers will be served sausage biscuits on morning flights and carrot and celery sticks on all other flights. Mr. Brooks also owns Naturally Fresh Foods, based in Atlanta, which provides all dips served on Hooters flights.
 How did this unlikely venture come to fruition? Last year, when the 66-year-old Mr. Brooks was unsuccessful in attempts to buy Vanguard Airlines out of bankruptcy, he bought the North Carolina-based Pace Airlines instead. Pace now operates the public charter flights, and Delta Air Lines provides ground services.
 The airline's passengers will primarily consist of travelers fond of the resort town's 30-mile Grand Strand strip of beaches, shops and golf courses. (Myrtle Beach also happens to be home to four Hooters restaurants.) On the inaugural flight, passengers were a mix of Myrtle Beach V.I.P.'s, Southern matrons, married couples and, to be expected, 30-something men. 
 Hooters isn't the first airline to use sex as a selling point. In the early 1970's, Southwest Airlines flight attendants sported hot pants and leather boots. Their counterparts at National Airlines seductively whispered in television commercials, "I'm going to fly you like you've never been flown before." 
 If this all sounds politically incorrect, it is. Hooters revels in that image-- its motto is "Delightfully tacky, yet unrefined."
 Robert Brooks is well aware of his company's reputation. "We are politically incorrect," he said. "But that's our customer base." JULIE BOSMAN

HEADLINE: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Guam Takes Steps To Reverse Setbacks

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: HAGATNA, Guam 

 BODY:
WIND, rain and fire blew through Guam last December in the worst supertyphoon to hit this westernmost corner of the United States in 40 years.
 Three months later, tourism is returning to normal on this tropical patch of milk-powder sand beaches and thickly forested mountains, the second most popular United States tourism destination in the Pacific, after Hawaii. With three-quarters of Guam's tourists coming from Japan, the island became in the 1990's a virtual economic colony of Japan, only a three-and-a-half-hour flight to the north. 
 On Tumon Bay, where a dozen high-rise hotels have created a miniature Waikiki of the Western Pacific, plywood sheets are gradually coming down, as rooms are repaired and returned to service. Massive air tubes still snake into sides of the Hilton and the Hyatt, completing a drying-out process. Rain had infiltrated everywhere, pushed by winds that peaked at 187 miles an hour, blowing the wind-measuring device off a wall at the international airport. 
 The typhoon destroyed 2,000 homes and damaged thousands more, making 35,000 people -- almost one-quarter of the island's population -- temporarily homeless. The storm also sparked a fire that burned for five days at the island's fuel tank farm, causing several days of gasoline rationing. 
 Decapitated coconut palms still line beaches and Polynesian-style huts are missing shingles, but pools now echo with the shouts of tourists and their children.
 "In March we are seeing some recovery, in April we will see full recovery," Alberto Lamorena, general manager of the Guam Visitors Bureau, said of hotel occupancies.
 Enormous amounts of debris have been cleaned up. Guam, the largest island between Hawaii and the Philippines, has 13 golf courses, one of the highest concentrations of golf holes per capita in the United States and its territories.
 "It looked like a trailer park after a tornado," said Bartley A. Jackson, general manager of the Pacific Islands Club and chairman of the Guam Hotel and Restaurant Association, of the post-typhoon debris.
"Everyone is shooting for completing repairs by the end of June," he added. "We have to be ready for Tokyo and Seoul summer vacation periods."
 The typhoon caused at least $100 million damage to hotels and government-run utilities here and pushed two Japanese-owned hotels into bankruptcy: the Guam Fujita and the Okura Island Inn. Two other hotels closed as a result of the Sept. 11 travel downturn. The four closings have reduced hotel rooms by almost 10 percent and reflect occupancy rates that slumped to 57 percent last year, from 87 percent in 1995.
 During the 1990's, hoteliers responded to high occupancy by roughly tripling the number of rooms to about 9,000. But tourism eroded, hitting one million last year, only three-quarters of the recent peak of 1997.
 Guam has been hit by a series of tourism calamities in recent years: three major typhoons; the 1996-1997 Asian currency crisis; the 1997 crash of a Korean Air jet here that killed 226 passengers; and, after Sept. 11, a drop in Japanese tourists, the result of nervousness about flying to a destination that bills itself in Asia as "Guam U.S.A." Now North Korea is playing brinksmanship with the United States over its nuclear program, leading to regional nervousness that could induce some Japanese tourists to avoid flying. 
 Since 2000, 7,710 jobs in the private sector, or 17 percent of the total, have been wiped out. December's supertyphoon will cost $45 million in lost tourism spending from Japan alone, according to Ernie A. Galito of the Visitors Bureau.
 "Japanese tourists are the central element of Guam's economy," said a Bank of Hawaii report in 2001. "They single-handedly steer the U.S. territory's level of employment, tax base, business receipts and, in the end, standard of living."
 But Japan's long-running economic stagnation extended its reach 1,500 miles south to this banana-shaped island. Last year, the average Japanese tourist in Guam spent $676, less than half the $1,500 average spent a decade ago. Tumon Beach properties are selling for a fraction of prices received a decade ago. 
 "Japan's economy has really killed us since 1990," said Carl Peterson, a board member of the Guam Chamber of Commerce, echoing a complaint that can be heard from Guam to Hawaii to Los Angeles. Noting the changing mix of tourists, he said: "We now get the ones with not so much money -- families, secretarial pools."
 To diversify, Guam is targeting South Korea, which now accounts for 12 percent of arrivals. The next goal is Asia's big tourism prize: China. "We are working to establish a Guam-only visa for China, the same kind of visa given to Japanese and Koreans," said Felix P. Camacho, the new governor. Under a visa waiver system, citizens of 14 Asian countries board flights to Guam without visas, filling out landing cards on board. American visas are needed for onward travel to anywhere else in the United States.
 Recognizing the potential of the Chinese market, Mr. Camacho, a Republican, promised to work very aggressively over the next few years to extend the visa-free access program to China, allowing Chinese to explore this cheery island that bills itself as "Where America's Day Begins."

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB; 
In Work and in Love, No Risk, No Reward

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Careers, like love, often travel a winding path. And where faint hearts falter, the bold may be rewarded. Occasionally, the path leads back to where it began, and sometimes it climbs to new and thrilling heights.
 IN 1998, Liz Claman was an anchor and reporter for a television station in Boston. "After on-air tours in Columbus and Cleveland, I had finally made it to a top-10 market, the be-all and, for some, end-all of television news," she writes. 
 But not for her. "One day in early February, I found myself on the coast of Rhode Island in gale-force winds," she says. "I had been sent to cover a whale carcass that had washed ashore. Standing there with my microphone stuck to my frozen fingers, getting pelted by icy salt water, I thought, 'Time to get out of this end of the business.' " 
From the beach, she called her agent. Two months later, she was told that CNBC, the business news cable channel, was interested in meeting with her. "Remember, it was early '98, and CNBC was still very much a niche network for financial professionals," Ms. Claman said. "However, the winds of change were beginning to kick up and CNBC executives were positioning themselves for the point when the average individual realized that he or she could take control of personal investing."
Ms. Claman was offered a freelance job with no benefits and was told that she would have to prove herself or be cut loose after 13 weeks. "I was torn," she writes. "I desperately wanted a change, but had not majored (or even minored) in business or finance."
She adds: "I called my father, who had always encouraged me to take chances in life. 'You must do this,' he said. 'You'll never regret taking on the challenge.' So, I quit my full-time-with-benefits anchor job and moved to New York, determined to sink my teeth into a completely different realm of television. There would be no wife-carrying contests, no city council meetings, no whale carcasses. I jumped head first into the world of currency fluctuations, hedge funds and commodities.
"I attended my own night school every evening, devouring books on investing, economics and high finance. Six weeks into the 13-week trial period, management called me in to tell me CNBC would be signing me to a long-term contract." 
Ms. Claman is now a co-anchor for the network's early-morning global business coverage and has her own interview segment called "Breakfast With the C.E.O."
She writes: "After four years at CNBC, I am so happy to have taken the risk. Scary? Yes. Regrets? None." 
"I changed my life for love," writes John H. Nesbitt, director of employment marketing at Monsanto in St. Louis.
In 1998, Mr. Nesbitt was the manager for staffing at the corporate headquarters of Lockheed Martin in Bethesda, Md. But there was one little problem. "I was unlucky in love," he says.
Unlucky, that is, until he met a woman from Scotland on the Internet.
"Without hesitation," Mr. Nesbitt says, he quit his job and boarded a plane for London and a new role -- "unemployment and Mr. Mom." Within a week of his arrival, Mr. Nesbitt married the woman, Laura Torrance, who was long divorced and living in London, working in information technology and the mother of three children.
Mr. Nesbitt writes: "The risk paid off personally and corporately. Not only did I find a supportive and wonderful wife (we have just celebrated our fourth wedding anniversary), I was also able to return to the United States in a bigger job (and title and more money and equity options) in recruiting only 10 months later in the great city of Chicago, despite being unemployed at age 49 and out of recruiting for a while." After a few years in Chicago, he joined Monsanto. 
Mr. Nesbitt's offered this advice: "Always put love over career."
When he decided on a career change, Lew Barr, now of Huntington Woods, Mich., a Detroit suburb, gave up his job. But so did his wife, Rochelle.
"In 1974, at age 33, I left Boston to earn an advanced degree in industrial relations at a Midwest college," Mr. Barr writes. "What we left behind was my wife's teaching career, my law career and our family and friends. What we brought along was our 6-week-old daughter. Though we intended to return to Boston after the school year, it didn't work out that way." 
Mr. Barr got a job in Michigan, and his wife eventually resumed teaching.
"Now, after almost 30 years, I'm planning to go home to Boston next year after having had a wonderful career in human resources with a large Midwest corporation," he says.
"For us, what initially looked like a big step backward turned out to be a great leap forward."
Sometimes the twists and turns in a career lead directly back to the beginning. So it was with Kristin Mitchell of Weehawken, N.J. 
In 1978, after many years as a clinical social worker in various settings, she became a consultant to a Superior Court in California, where she faced the challenges and stresses of dealing with divorced couples fighting over custody of children and visitation rights. "Not fun," Ms. Mitchell says.
Then her own marriage ended; her consultancy ended, and although she went on to other jobs, she eventually decided to join a tour through Africa, camping out for 10 months with 23 people.
"What ensued was the trip of a lifetime," she writes. "What I faced upon return must have been the payback."
She had no job. Her finances dwindled. She became depressed. "I had always loved people, being with them, working with them, doing social work," she writes. "Now though, the employment market was limited, and jobs paid poorly or held no interest for me. Finding myself isolated, lonely and broke, I began considering other careers." She decided that maybe she was not made to be a social worker.
She did part-time research for a medical group. She hated it. She entered a university school of education to become a teacher and was a student teacher in a bilingual elementary school, "where all I wanted to do was social work the kids," she writes.
Then someone -- she cannot remember who -- suggested that she give herself permission to change her mind. "I realized that I could reframe the whole dismal picture I had created," she says. "I left the university and threw myself into private practice as a clinical social worker. Quickly and much to my surprise, the business took off," and she found that she loved the work.
"Perhaps the comparison with a more thankless profession is what turned things around for me," she writes, "or maybe it was realizing I had made the right decision for myself in the first place by choosing a career that best suited my talents and personality. At any rate, I did discover that one key to establishing a fulfilling and gratifying career is to allow for change."
After earning a master's degree in health care administration, Michael T. Moore, now of Wichita, Kan., worked for 25 years as a hospital administrator. He spent the last 13 of them as chief executive of three hospitals. "For most of those years, I loved my job," he writes.
But about a decade ago, health care changed and the focus seemed to become the bottom line, he said.
"My daily life, once so challenging and rewarding, was becoming a war with a seven-headed monster; death and disease, as always, but also Medicare, Medicaid, H.M.O.'s, insurance companies and the I.R.S.," he says. "The fine institutions I worked for and my talented colleagues continue that battle."
Mr. Moore fantasized about a major career change. He had always been passionate about aviation. He was a commercial pilot, a flight instructor and an owner of small airplanes, whose log books span more than 30 years. "Learning about what makes airplanes work has always been a joy," he writes, "and my four years as a maintenance officer in the U.S. Air Force are still fondly remembered."
At 53, after much thought, discussion with his wife and others and lots of prayer, he says, "I enrolled in a technical school to become an aircraft maintenance technician -- a mechanic."
"To say that making this transition was frightening is an understatement," he adds. "But the only thing more frightening was not doing it, with deathbed regrets of heartfelt paths not taken."
Upon his graduation in 2000, Mr. Moore was hired by the Cessna Aircraft Company in Wichita. He prepared new Citation business jets for their first test flights and their new owners. Then he became a sales administrator and an account manager for Caravan single-engine turboprop aircraft. These days, he writes, "I am a member of a team that supports the marketing and sale of Cessna Citation jets throughout the world.
"For me," Mr. Moore says, "this transition continues to be illuminating and rewarding."

As Low Rates Spur Sales, Rental Market Weakens

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
IN Westchester's cities as well as its more suburban, and even rural, communities, the inventory of apartments and houses for rent has been increasing in the past year, with asking rents rising very slowly or even declining as a result, real estate agents report. 
 This softening in the rental market is occurring at the same time that sales of houses, co-ops and condominiums continue to be strong. There are a number of variables at work, according to James Renwick, the president of Renwick & Winterling Realty in Bedford, "like Wall Street, war and the weather." 
 But overriding all the other variables, the primary cause for the softening of the residential rental market, according to Mr. Renwick and other real estate agents, has been the steep drop in mortgage rates. This has made purchasing a more appealing alternative than renting for many householders. 
As a result, a three-bedroom house on four acres in Bedford that formerly rented for $5,600 a month, is now sitting empty and has been for several months, said Mr. Renwick. His agency serves Bedford and the surrounding area, one of the county's more expensive sections. 
"In the past, we would have rented it to someone who was transferred here who wanted to rent while they looked for a place to buy, or to people from the city who rented as a way of seeing whether they liked living in the county and could manage the commute to New York," he said. "Now, if they can, they're buying right off."
In communities along the Long Island Sound shoreline and in central Westchester, the rental market has been similarly sluggish, said Craig Scher, the owner of CS Realty in Harrison. Mr. Scher cited the severe downturn in the technology sector of the economy as one of the causes.
Mr. Scher said, "We did a tremendous business with the dot-coms," which had a strong presence in White Plains and Harrison. He added: "It wasn't at all uncommon to get a call saying, 'I need eight apartments or even 15.' But almost all of that business is gone now." As a result, some landlords have to upgrade apartments that leased for top dollar three years ago to continue charging the same high rents today, Mr. Scher said. 
CS Realty's survey of apartments in White Plains, Larchmont, Harrison, Port Chester, Rye, Mamaroneck and New Rochelle showed that rents for studios and for one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments dropped as much as 8 percent during 2002. For example, in Mr. Scher's target area, the average price for a three-bedroom apartment was down to $2,223 in 2002, from $2,396 in 2001. The price for a one-bedroom dropped to $1,285 from $1,385 in 2001.
One countywide survey, limited to apartments not represented by brokers, found average monthly rents at the end of 2002 were $894 for a studio, $1,218 for a one-bedroom, $1,674 for a two-bedroom and $2,070 for a three-bedroom. The figures are gathered by Westchester Residential Opportunities, a nonprofit housing organization in White Plains, by tracking apartment listings in two local newspapers.
The Westchester County Board of Realtors, which tracks sales of residences, does not compile figures for rentals.
While Toni Downes, the executive director of Westchester Residential Opportunities, did not report actual decreases in rents for the county as a whole, she said there had been a slowing over all in the rate of increases in rents during the past year.
For example, one-bedroom apartments, now going for an average of $1,218 a month, were renting for an average of $1,190 in 2001, according to the organization's figures. "That's only 2 percent, which is a relatively small increase," Ms. Downes said. Two-bedroom rental units continued to be "the most sought-after type of rental housing in the county," she said, with rents up 5 percent from $1,594 in 2001.
The rental market in White Plains, where inventories are increasing significantly, presents a unique picture. Nicholas Wolff, the owner and principal broker of Century 21 Wolff, said it was going to be difficult to absorb all the new inventory. During the past year, the city has seen a spate of new apartment construction, the first in about a decade. About 1,700 new units have been proposed. 
ABOUT 500 of those new units, at Bank Street Commons -- a twin tower complex next to the Metro-North Railroad station -- came on the market last month, with the first tenants scheduled to move in by the middle of April. Units there range from $1,950 for a one-bedroom to $2,800 for the highest-priced two-bedroom.
Because the competition for tenants is expected to be intense, especially since the 1,700 apartments are being added to an established stock of older apartments, Bank Street Commons is offering one month rent free to new tenants and a cash rebate of $1,500 to the first 50 tenants to sign leases, said Esther Mena, the leasing manager. The complex is also waiving the $300 a year amenities fee, covering a fitness center and a pool, she said. Since Feb. 15, 20 apartments have been rented.
Another 260 apartments in a new building on Canfield Avenue called Clayton Park came on the market in November. No rebates or incentives are being offered, and so far, 30 units have been leased, said Arlem Garcia, a leasing agent. Rents at Clayton Park begin at $1,795 for one-bedroom apartments and go up to $2,581 for two-bedroom corner units.
Nino Petruccelli, an agent with Prudential Rand Realty in White Plains, said prices had already begun to drop on rental units in several older buildings like the Seasons on Lexington Avenue. In some cases, one-bedroom one-bath units there that were renting for as much as $2,000 last year are now renting for $1,500 a month. "When there's so much coming on the market at once, it's tough to absorb it all," Mr. Petruccelli said.
The rental market in the more affluent communities in the southern part of the county has also slowed, reported Liz Lindsay, the manager of the Houlihan/Lawrence office in Bronxville. With anxieties growing about the international situation and the economy in general, "cocooning instincts" were being heightened, she said. That longing for a safe haven, she said, may even translate into home purchases as opposed to rentals. "I have a nice group of rentals that in other times would have been all gone," Ms. Lindsay said, citing as an example a five-bedroom, three-bath house for $7,200 a month "that would normally fly out of here." 
Clearly, the low interest rates are also acting as a brake on the rental market. "With mortgage rates so low, it doesn't pay to rent," Ms. Lindsay said.
Figures from White Horse Mortgage Services, an affiliate of Houlihan/Lawrence, show that instead of paying $2,000 a month for an apartment, a home buyer can spend the same money (including $500 a month for property taxes and $100 a month for homeowners' insurance) for a $261,000 mortgage at 5 percent, roughly the rate being offered on some 15-year mortgages. Adding whatever down payment is made to the $261,000 would equal the purchase price, said Edna Haber, president and chief executive of White Horse in Bronxville. 
In an example from the high end of the market, for $6,000 a month, a consumer can spend $1,667 a month for property taxes, $150 a month for homeowners' insurance and $4,183 for a $698,000 mortgage at 6 percent.
THE sluggish rental market has been cited in the cancellation or delay of some major rental projects in the county. Last fall, AvalonBay Communities announced it was putting off construction of a second building of Avalon on the Sound in downtown New Rochelle. The company has built one apartment tower with 412 units and was planning a 39-story second building. Company officials said the low interest rates and resultant focus on home buying, as well as the decline in new corporate jobs in the county -- which translates into fewer relocations to Westchester -- had slowed interest in higher-end apartments. 
In White Plains, David Seltzer, president of the Seltzer Group, said he was hoping to begin construction within 90 days on the Hamilton, a 106-unit luxury apartment building that has already been delayed more than six months. Mr. Seltzer said the reason for the delay was that he wanted to study the rental market and ascertain the nature of customer demand.
Meanwhile, prices and demand at the lower end of the rental market -- for units costing $1,000 a month and less -- are holding steady, reported Dawn Roman, a co-owner of Century 21 Dawn's Gold Realty, in Yonkers. Her company owns more than a dozen apartment buildings in Yonkers, New Rochelle and Harrison. More expensive rentals are staying on the market longer, while house rentals are not moving at all, she said.
The summer rental market in northern Westchester is similarly slow, reported Mr. Renwick in Bedford. The same factors that have troubled the year-round rental market -- the harsh winter, worries about war and the economy and low interest rates -- have had a negative effect on the summer market too, Mr. Renwick said. "Usually by February, it's hopping in Bedford," Mr. Renwick said. "This year it's very, very quiet."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
Vacancies Are Rare Along Major Retail Corridors

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
THE vacancy rate hit a record low -- 2 percent -- in an annual survey of 24.7 million square feet of retail properties along six major routes in northern New Jersey. Richard J. Brunelli, president of the company that compiles the survey, said that if a few "ill conceived" large buildings that are unlikely to be renovated and have remained empty for a year or more were removed from the calculation, it would be even lower. Without these buildings, the overall vacancy rate would sink to 1.1 percent.
 Mr. Brunelli, whose firm, R. J. Brunelli & Company, is based in Old Bridge, said vacancy rates actually increased slightly along Routes 17 and 23 in 2002 compared with the previous year -- but only to 1.9 and 1.6 percent, respectively. Vacancies decreased along Routes 4, 10, 22, and 46, he said. Mr. Brunelli studies shopping centers and freestanding retail buildings only, not enclosed malls. 
 "Reducing its already low vacancy factor in the face of a very difficult retail environment, northern New Jersey again demonstrated why it remains one of the nation's most desirable markets for retailers," Mr. Brunelli commented in his report for 2002, released in mid-March. In his 2001 report Mr. Brunelli found a vacancy rate of 3.1 percent. 
Other market specialists noted that the Brunelli report focuses on the northern part of the state -- Bergen, Essex, Morris, Passaic, Somerset and Union Counties -- its most densely populated region, indeed, one of the most densely settled areas in the country.
If the same survey were to be done statewide, it would almost certainly show a higher vacancy rate, several said. "I would guess 4 percent," said C. Beth Krinsky of Newmark Properties. Matthew K. Harding of the Levin Management Corporation and Jonathan B. Schultz of the Schultz Organization/TCN Worldwide concurred, and both noted that there is plenty of room to develop more retail space in southern New Jersey -- but space is scarce in northern New Jersey, where government regulations require most projects to be located in already urbanized areas.
"All this has the effect of making the retail space that exists more desirable," Mr. Schultz said.
A portfolio of eight shopping centers in northern New Jersey comprising a million square feet was put on the market in December and was under contract by early this month, according to several of the losing bidders. They say the Inland Real Estate Corporation, a real estate investment trust, won out in heavy bidding for the Starwood Heller portfolio. Andrew J. Merin of Cushman & Wakefield, the broker for the deal, confirmed there was a contract but would not offer details because the sale will not close until next month.
SOME brokers cautioned that more space is likely to come on the market this year, with several chain store bankruptcies possible. But Mr. Brunelli commented in his 13th annual report that the casualties of a sour economy do not seem to make much of a dent in the northern retail market.
"This densely populated region is able to easily absorb the effects of retailer bankruptcies and downsizings," he said. "As one chain goes out, another is waiting in the wings to step in."
"Considering that supply-demand equation," he continued, "the upcoming closings of Wiz and Zany Brainy stores, all of which were still operating at the time of our 2002 survey, are not expected to have a major impact on the region's vacancy factor."
Kmart did not shutter any stores in northern New Jersey in either its first or second round of closings, Mr. Brunelli noted. If any Kmarts are closed in the future, he predicted, "rapid absorption could be expected."
On the other hand, Mr. Schultz said, he does not believe the area has the "refill capacity" it previously enjoyed. "The chains that can use the big boxes, like Bed, Bath and Beyond, Circuit City, are already here," he said. "Some expansion is possible, but most of the stores that are really looking for space, such as Lowe's Home Improvement, tend to need their own prototypical buildings. They want all their stores laid out the same, with the same ceiling height, load-bearing requirements, and so on."
Ms. Krinsky observed that some upscale retailers are very particular about choosing locations, wanting to operate only in customized spaces in hand-picked towns.
"Some of these big boxes are so antiquated," she said, "they do not fit what many of the expanding stores want." While a few have been turned into fitness centers, Ms. Krinsky noted, "others might be knocked down to create new space for a retailer who likes the site, but not the space." 
At the former Mall at Four on Route 4 in Fairlawn, Thomasville Furniture Center has taken over the entire second floor, and consequently, Mr. Brunelli said, the vacancy rate on the three-mile stretch of Route 4 from Paramus to Fairlawn fell sharply, from 3.8 percent to 1.7 percent. There is now only 5,000 square feet available in the 135,000-square-foot shopping center.
As for new development, Mr. Brunelli pointed to the Shops at Union Hill on Route 10 in Denville that is now opening, in phases. Virtually all 83,000 square feet of space at the upscale shopping center, located in a highly affluent area without a major mall, was leased before or during construction.
ALONG the 20-mile corridor of Route 10 from Livingston to Ledgewood, Mr. Brunelli said, the vacancy rate dipped to 1.9 percent, after three years of slight increases. 
Along a 21-mile section of Route 22 from Union to Somerville, which Mr. Brunelli termed as "northern New Jersey's most heavily retailed corridor," the vacancy rate also fell significantly -- to 2.5 percent, from 4.5 percent in 2001. In this area, the survey includes space along roads that intersect with the main roadway, taking in Route 202-206 from the Somerville traffic circle north into Bridgewater and the nearby intersection of Routes 28 and 287 in Bridgewater. 
According to the 2002 survey, there were 198,806 square feet of vacancies in 7.91 million square feet of space. Two former Harrow's casual furniture stores, in Union and Greenbrook, were leased to a Mercedes-Benz dealership and a furniture store, respectively, taking about 50,000 square feet off the market. Also, 20,000 square feet of small-store vacancies in Watchung's Blue Star shopping center were filled in 2002.
Mr. Brunelli said he saw what happened at Blue Star as emblematic of a trend in northern and central New Jersey. "In addition to continuing strong interest from national and regional chains, landlords are getting offers from the growing ranks of mom-and-pop entrepreneurs who are using their early retirement buyouts from major corporations to open independent or franchised stores, restaurants or service businesses," he said.
For other retail corridors, the Brunelli report had these findings:
On the 15-mile stretch of Route 17 from Paramus to Mahwah, the vacancy rate rose slightly to 1.9 percent, from a low of 1.5 percent in 2001. In 1999, the rate had been as high as 5.2 percent. Only six of the 138 properties along the corridor had vacancies, 
The increase in 2002 was primarily attributable to 39,000 square feet of vacancies at the Fashion Plaza shopping center -- which is still 91 percent leased -- and the closing of Service Merchandise in a center anchored by Burlington Coat Factory. Modell's took a portion of the former Service Merchandise space, leaving 6,000 square feet available. 
Meanwhile, Ikea, the home furnishings retailer, is putting up a large building at the long-vacant former Alexander's property at the junction of Route 17 with Route 4. Ikea will open its own 130,000-square-foot store and plans to lease 40,000 additional square feet to other retailers. 
On Route 4 between Paramus and Fairlawn, where 1 million square feet of retail space is available, only five of the 46 properties reviewed had vacancies. None exceeded 5,000 square feet in size.
In an area that includes 21 miles of Route 46 from Dover to West Paterson as well as 800,000 square feet along an adjoining section of Route 3 in Clifton, the vacancy rate dropped to 1.5 percent, from 2.9 percent. Two large spaces totaling 122,000 square feet at Arlington Plaza in Parsippany -- one of them a former Bradlee's discount store and the other a Shop-Rite supermarket that relocated -- were leased to Home Depot and another retailer, as yet undisclosed, the report noted. 
On the western portion of the roadway, an Ames store that closed last year in the Rockaway shopping center in which Shop-Rite is a co-anchor is being torn down to make way for new, undisclosed, tenants.
Along a portion of Route 23, running from Wayne to Butler, the vacancy rate edged upward to 1.6 percent last year. The rise was attributed to vacancies at the 300,000-square-foot Plains Plaza in Pompton Plains, which had been fully leased in 2001.

HEADLINE: The Turmoil Over Mold in Buildings 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
IT is a slimy, sticky, black, brownish or sometimes orangey organism that mostly comes in knobby, though sometimes hairy, microscopic ovals -- half a million or more spores fitting on the face of a dime.
 Mold, in some of its myriad forms, has long been known to cause serious damage to some people's pulmonary systems. But over the last five years, for a mix of reasons, the literally creepy substance has also exerted increasing strains on the real estate industry, the insurance industry, the court system and architectural and construction practices. 
 Yet, given that fungus (its more scientific appellation) has inhabited the planet for millions of years, there are those caught up in the current concern who contend that, however legitimate in some cases, that worry has also been exaggerated.
The confusion stems, in part, from the fact that while some people can suffer serious health damage from exposure to mold, others are unaffected. 
Some of the agitation was stirred by a federal agency's initial opinion, later reversed, that mold might have caused bleeding in the lungs of infants. Also in the mix has been litigious piling on after sizable damage awards in several court cases, including one, later scaled back, for $32 million; the insurance industry's hasty retreat from mold coverage; and insufficient understanding of the medical consequences of mold exposure.
"Five years ago, we would get one call a month about mold: a residence, a school, a commercial property," said Robert Krell, president of IAQ Technologies, an indoor environmental consulting and remediation company in Syracuse, N.Y. "Now we get 10 calls a day."
"I've seen people become deathly ill," Mr. Krell said. "I've also seen them make themselves ill with hysteria."
Daniel Sitomer, a partner in the environmental law firm of Sitomer & Hogan in Manhattan, calls for calm on the legal front, where about 10,000 mold-related lawsuits have been filed nationwide in the last three years. "What we've found where the knee-jerk response was to overreact and litigate," Mr. Sitomer said, "is that those who have commenced those suits have directly impacted the value of their own home." 
Mr. Sitomer's firm represents both plaintiffs and defendants in mold-related cases, but specializes in preparing building managers and co-op and condominium boards to deal with the mold problem. "There's time to commence litigation after there's been a unified effort by the building and the residents to manage the mold," he said. "Once that's implemented, there's time to address responsibility and the development of claims."
About 24,000 homeowners across the nation -- including 1,600 in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- had mold-related insurance claims unresolved as of Dec. 31, according to a Texas-based homeowners advocacy group called Policyholders of America.
Last year, according to Robert P. Hartwig, the chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, insurance companies paid out $2.5 billion in mold-related claims. "That's about double what it was in 2001," Mr. Hartwig said.
"In addition, in 2002 it became clear that the mold issue was no longer confined to homeowners' insurance," Mr. Hartwig continued, "but became a problem in commercial coverage as well -- particularly for co-ops, condominiums, hotels and schools." Because they are corporations, co-ops and condominiums must carry commercial liability coverage.
The insurance industry has not taken kindly to the explosion in mold-related claims. At the industry's urging, 35 states -- including New Jersey, but not New York or Connecticut -- have allowed insurers to exclude mold coverage from homeowner policies. "In some states," Mr. Hartwig said, "insurers have introduced caps on the coverage for this type of claim, perhaps $5,000 or $10,000."
All of which squeezes homeowners and building owners. 
In Texas -- which along with California leads the nation in mold claims, at just under 5,000 each (followed by Florida with 3,900) -- the per-policy cost of industry payouts for mold coverage rose from $23 in the first quarter of 2000 to $444 by the end of 2001, Mr. Hartwig said. "These costs are passed on to policyholders," he said.
Rental buildings have also been affected, with some landlords informing renters that they could be held responsible for not removing visible moisture or not reporting the appearance of mold to management.
With coverage limited and insurance companies fiercely contesting court claims, some owners of private homes are facing frightening choices -- especially those with widespread contamination deep within their walls, plumbing, heating and ventilation systems. In those cases, remediation can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
"One issue we are seeing more and more of these days is foreclosures," said Melinda Ballard, president of Policyholders of America. Ms. Ballard started her organization after winning the nation's most publicized mold-related lawsuit against an insurer, resulting in a damage award of $32 million -- later reduced to $4 million.
"Let's say you have a family in a home with severe contamination and it's not covered by insurance," Ms. Ballard said. "They face ugly choices. They can stay and have their children suffer the health consequences. They can put their home up for sale and not disclose anything. Or they can hand the keys to the bank."
Starting in midyear 2002, Ms. Ballard said, her organization began receiving about 50 calls a week from people facing foreclosure because of mold exposure. "Here's the rub," she said, "when the bank forecloses, they sell it at auction -- as-is."

The Setting
High-Tech Conditions May Promote Mold
 Modern architecture and construction techniques, particularly for high-rise buildings, are also affected by mold concerns. Pointing out that there are spores in the air everywhere, Mr. Sitomer, the environmental lawyer, said, "In today's sealed buildings, tightly controlled environments, central air-conditioning, mold grows at much higher levels than outside."
To which New York State Senator Carl L. Marcellino, a Republican from Long Island and chairman of the Senate Environmental Conservation Committee, said, "Maybe you don't seal new buildings; let them breathe."
Senator Marcellino is the sponsor of a bill that would create a commission of scientists, lawyers, insurers, architects and builders to advise government officials on mold policy.
Worries about mold, he said, are as much a problem in the suburbs as in urban high-rises. "That leaky roof dripping behind your Sheetrock becomes a nesting place," he said. "You fix the roof, but nobody looks behind the wall."

The Health Impact
A Range of Fungi, A Range of Effects
Several experts said widespread mold anxiety got its start in the mid-90's after 10 babies in neighboring buildings in Cleveland suffered severe bleeding in the lungs, including one who died. Investigators from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention joined independent scientists in concluding that "infant pulmonary hemorrhage may be caused by exposure to Stachybotrys chartarum or other fungi growing in moist household environments." Stachybotrys has since been seized upon by some lawyers as "killer mold."
In 1997, a C.D.C. task force reviewed the initial findings and concluded that the evidence "was not of sufficient quality to support an association" between Stachybotrys and bleeding lungs in infants.
Which hardly means that mold is harmless. "We know that there are a range of health effects related to mold exposure," said Dr. Maida P. Galvez, a pediatrician at the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. "The most common are asthma and allergy-type symptoms."
"We know that families with strong histories of allergic diseases are more susceptible to these exposures," Dr. Galvez said, "that mold can exacerbate these conditions." At a minimum, mold can cause eye, ear, nose and throat irritation, as well as coughing and wheezing -- sometimes severe and unrelenting.
While mold exacerbates those conditions for people prone to allergies and asthma, Dr. Galvez said, it has not yet been proved to be a direct instigator of asthma in families without a history of that disease. "There are ongoing studies to determine that relationship," she said.
Still, mold can be deadly. Dr. Jordan Fink, a professor in the allergy and immunology division of the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, said mold can cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis, resulting in progressive lung impairment. "There have been fatal cases of hypersensitivity pneumonitis," he said, "because of the inflammation and scarring of pulmonary tissue." 
Pointing out that there are "hundreds to thousands" of mold species that have not been studied, Dr. Fink focused on the notorious Stachybotrys variety. While it is proved that Stachybotrys causes pulmonary and allergic symptoms, he said, "there is no documentation as yet that Stachybotrys can cause nonallergic-type symptoms." As examples, he said, some people say they suffer memory loss, "can't think anymore, can't eat."
Ms. Ballard, president of the policyholders group, said that she, her husband and 2-year-old son lived for months in their contaminated 22-room home in a suburb of Austin, Tex. -- "called, appropriately enough, Dripping Springs," she said -- after being told by their insurance company that the contractors hired to remediate Stachybotrys in their home could not break through the walls and floors until the insurance investigation was completed. "I stupidly, not knowing jack about toxic mold, listened to them and stopped all scheduled repairs," she said. That was in 1998.
"We started getting sick," Ms. Ballard said. "My son would gasp for every breath. My husband had some strange symptoms. He became extremely forgetful. He had driven the same car for years and could not remember what kind of car it was. He had brain seizures that showed up on M.R.I.'s."
The old "fixer upper" had cost $300,000, Ms. Ballard said, and about $1 million to modernize. The $32 million in damages was awarded in 2001, but was later reduced to $4 million, plus interest and lawyers' fees.
In December, a mold suit was filed by the owner of a condominium apartment at 515 Park Avenue -- advertised by its sponsors, at $3,000 per square foot, as the world's most expensive residential building.
The suit alleges that the developer, architect, contractors and condominium board members had all been negligent in the design, construction and management of the building, which opened in 2000, resulting in "massive leaks" throughout the structure.
"As recent studies performed for the building's board of managers confirmed," the suit says, "the building is contaminated with toxic fungus molds, including a strain known as Stachybotrys, the 'killer fungus.' "
The plaintiff, Richard Kramer, claimed that the apartment and its contents, including antiques and artwork, were totally ruined. "Such damage pales," the suit says, in comparison with the harm to the plaintiff's 3-year-old daughter, "who has developed severe and disabling respiratory and other illnesses."
Mr. Kramer is asking for $2 billion in damages. Lawyers for the developers, Zeckendorf Realty, did not respond to several requests for comment.
According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, 35 million Americans suffer from reactions to mold -- 12 percent of the nation's population.
"Do we design buildings to take care of the person who is allergic or the person who is not?" wonders Angelo Garcia III, the principal industrial hygienist at Future Environment Designs, a consultation and remediation company on Long Island. "Do you build for one in eight persons?"
Senator Marcellino believes, "It will come to setting regulatory standards that force people to take the effects of mold into consideration when they create buildings, maintain buildings."

Remediation
Process Starts By Eliminating Leaks
 Until then, what is a homeowner or building owner to do? In a phrase: stop leaks.
Mold thrives on moisture. And, as Mr. Garcia emphasized, remediation requires elimination of the source. "Whatever caused water damage must be fixed," he said. "Realistically, that should be done before the cleaning, because the mold will come back." Better yet, leaks should be eliminated before mold ever takes root.
If mold does become visible -- a big if, given that it also thrives in a building's dark recesses -- a cleanup is in order.
The Old Testament, while genteelly referring to moldas mildew, offers a harsh prescription. Speaking of "the priest," Leviticus 14, says: "If mildew has spread on the walls, he is to order that the contaminated stones be torn out." If mildew reappears, it says, "the house must be torn down."
Mr. Krell stressed, however, that "not every time somebody has a few square feet of mold do they have to burn the house down or default on their mortgage. Most people can wear gloves, a surgical mask and safety goggles and perform a limited cleanup themselves."
If a homeowner prefers the reassurance of hiring a professional for a small cleanup, Mr. Krell said, the least expensive job would cost about $800. Still, he said: "We've been involved in projects in excess of $300,000. There was a massive job in Alpine, N.J., involving faulty construction on a 20,000-square-foot mansion. There were 8,000 square feet of mold throughout the basement. Eventually, they forced the builder to buy the house back, for $5 million."
But if mold has only crept halfway up a wall, for instance, and the owner wants to personally perform the cleanup, then strong detergent or bleach, water and a lot of elbow grease are in order. "Scrub the area until nothing is visible," Mr. Garcia said. "You only do this on nonporous surfaces -- wood, metal, plaster." Fabrics, books and even wallboard are porous and, if contaminated, might have to be disposed of.
Big jobs are, obviously, more complicated. "If, let's say, it gets into the ventilation system," Mr. Garcia said, "you've got to clean throughout the house. Then the job becomes similar to asbestos removal -- sealing the windows, high-efficiency filters to clean the air, vacuums with filters, all surfaces cleaned."
If the job is done correctly -- another big if -- the workers will wear respirators, protective suits, gloves. "They will build a chamber next to or in the house to decontaminate themselves, so they don't bring out the contaminants," Mr. Garcia said. All removed materials will be sealed in plastic bags for disposal. Pretesting will be necessary to establish parameters for the project, Mr. Krell said, and to set reference points for air and surface testing after the job is done.
In 1995, Mr. Garcia said, his company remediated an entire two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan for $7,000. Asked if prices have gone up since, he said that, in fact, "as more contractors get into this, prices come down."
And that is part of the problem.
As Mr. Krell said: "Almost every water and fire restoration contractor, every lead and asbestos abatement contractor in the country is jumping into this field. And many are ill-prepared." There are no state or federal regulations for mold consultants and contractors.
The federal Environmental Protection Agency and the New York City Department of Health have written remediation guidelines. And there are two organizations -- the American Indoor Air Quality Council, (800) 942-0832, www.iaqcouncil.org; and the Indoor Air Quality Association, (301) 231-8388, www.iaqa.org) -- that offer lists of contractors who have completed voluntary certification requirements. But Mr. Krell believes those requirements are not stringent enough.
So, in choosing a contractor, the watchword is "references, references, references," he said. "Ask for a list of previous clients they have done similar work for." 
It is also crucial, Mr. Krell said, to make sure that the consultant and contractor have specific mold coverage in their insurance policies, in case, for example, "they spread contamination throughout the rest of the building through poor work practices."
Extrapolating those precautions to the biggest residential buildings, Mr. Sitomer, the Manhattan environmental lawyer, said that, on that scale, "managing mold has to be a partnership between building owners and residents, allowing for a free flow of information that reduces fear."
Reiterating his position that apartment owners should not overreact, Mr. Sitomer said: "With litigation comes public disclosure of the issues as the plaintiff sees them. That not only can have an adverse effect on apartment values, it can also complicate the board's attempt to manage the problem."
A cornerstone of a building's partnership is that residents, board members and management fully understand the extent of insurance coverage for mold -- from the apartment owners' policies to the board members' directors and officers insurance to the entire building's liability policy.
Building staff should be trained to respond quickly and appropriately -- sealing mold in plastic sheeting, informing management and calling in a contractor -- so problems are not increased by mishandling of mold.
And buildings should prescreen consultants and contractors -- and their insurance coverage -- allowing for rapid response. "If building staff first has to find qualified contractors," Mr. Sitomer said, "the spores have time to spread."

For the Jobless, Some Free Legal Help

BYLINE:  By Steven Greenhouse 

 BODY:
AFTER seven months as a receptionist in a podiatrist's office, Gloribel Jimenez was called for jury duty, and she was thrilled by the case she was selected to serve on. A man from Kazakhstan was on trial, charged with trying to extort money from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's company, Bloomberg L.P. After a three-week trial, the man was convicted, and when Ms. Jimenez reported back to her office in the Bronx in late February, she received some bad news. 
 "My boss said he didn't need me any longer," she said. 
 Shocked and angry, Ms. Jimenez applied for unemployment benefits, but the New York State Department of Labor turned her down, saying it had no record that her employer had paid unemployment insurance taxes. 
She turned to a neighborhood law office for help. That office told her to call a hotline run by MFY Legal Services, a Manhattan nonprofit group that gives free legal advice to hundreds of unemployed New Yorkers each year. 
After Ms. Jimenez called the MFY hotline (212-417-3838), she was given an appointment with a lawyer at a once-a-month legal clinic that MFY runs on the Lower East Side. On a recent afternoon, Ms. Jimenez and 15 other unemployed workers, including a teacher, a janitor and a cashier, met with the three lawyers at the clinic, held at a branch of the University Settlement House. 
The lawyer whoadvised Ms. Jimenez promised to try to track down whether her employer had paid unemployment insurance taxes, perhaps under a corporate name different from the one she knew.
"This clinic is really good because it helps people who don't have money for lawyers," Ms. Jimenez said.
With unemployment rising in New York, the hotline and legal clinic are part of a growing effort by nonprofits to provide not just legal advice to the unemployed, but also representation at hearings where unemployed New Yorkers appeal government decisions rejecting their applications for jobless benefits. 
"We wanted to do neighborhood-based clinics because we thought there was a need to have a place where people could come and have easy access to legal advice after they lost their jobs," said Lynn Kelly, executive director of MFY, which descended from Mobilization for Youth, a neighborhood program for the poor founded in the 1960's.
Those who attend the MFY clinic frequently complain that they were unjustly denied benefits, often saying that their employers wrongly told the state they were not laid off, but quit voluntarily. Companies have an incentive to seek to deny jobless benefits because the more former workers a company has on unemployment insurance, the higher its unemployment taxes. 
MFY's hotline and clinic were developed with the National Employment Law Project, a legal services office that received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to help the fast-growing number of unemployed people after the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. MFY also has grants from the New York Community Trust and the New York Foundation and provides the jobless with legal advice on other matters like avoiding eviction. The National Employment Law Project worked with MFY to set up its clinic and with the Legal Aid Society to set up another hotline (888-218-6974) and clinic.
"We set up these clinics because during this economic downturn, the idea of getting unemployed people income replacement quickly seemed like a good idea," said Jim Williams, executive director of the National Employment Law Project. "That's why we decided to focus on unemployment insurance and unpaid wage claims."
The MFY and Legal Aid clinics have income eligibility limits, generally restricting help to people earning less than $500 a week and having limited assets. Because the maximum weekly unemployment benefit in New York is $405, many unemployed New Yorkers who not long ago earned far more than $500 a week can qualify for the clinics. 
"Even if we're approached by investment bankers who we know must have some savings, we won't turn them away completely, we try to give them meaningful advice," said Marlen Bodden, who runs Legal Aid's clinic. 
There are two older efforts providing legal advice and representation to the unemployed: the Workers Defense League, (212-627-1931) a nonprofit organization dating from 1936, and the Unemployment Action Center (212-998-6568), where law-school students help the unemployed. Those groups provide advice without regard to income. "We'll represent everyone from proletarians to professionals," said Jon Bloom, executive director of the Workers Defense League.

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for DAVID H. DIESSLIN; 
No Need to Stand Still In Uncertain Times

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN MARINO 

 BODY:
WITH the onset of war in Iraq last week, these precarious economic times became even more uncertain. Many people, already uneasy about their household budgets, investments and job security, are wondering how their finances will be affected by the war and its aftermath, and what they should do to minimize any difficulties ahead.
 Even before the war, people were cutting their spending. In an online survey of 2,645 adults conducted this month by the NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y., 41 percent of the respondents said they planned to spend less than usual on discretionary products and services this spring, while 45 percent planned to spend about the same and only 14 percent planned to spend more. 
 But with interest rates low -- and maybe going lower -- it may be a good time for some people to borrow and spend more, not less. In an interview last Thursday, David H. Diesslin, who owns a financial advisory firm in Fort Worth and is the chairman-elect of the board of governors of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, discussed some strategies that consumers might consider. VIVIAN MARINO

Q. What's the most practical financial advice you can give to people now?

A. It's hard to be specific right now. You almost have to be something like a philosopher when you're dealing with the environment we're walking through; the things we can control are so limited. But I look at uncertainty as times of opportunity if you can look past the next headline.
You can take advantage of opportunities within your career, your investments and with your family. You need to look out over the next 10 to 15 years. The development of human capital is important. You can take night courses or participate in weekend programs, develop special projects, create value in the enterprise you're involved in. 

Q. Would you suggest taking any special precautions, like keeping more cash around the house?

A. I think practical things evolve around having options, such as: Do you have access to funding if you for some reason couldn't come back to the house for a period of time? Do you have a secondary location for critical financial documents and phone numbers?

Q. Should we be reducing discretionary spending, or trimming back more on household debt?

A. I think it's always wise to run a balanced budget. But I personally am determined not to let world events change how I may conduct my life, my travel plans or my personal agendas, because somehow I think it lets the other side win.
I think that trimming debt has become a national pastime, like losing weight. I'm always in favor of being financially fit. But don't let the temporary times bring about radical changes you wouldn't have made outside what's pragmatic for you.

Q. What are some of the most obvious vulnerabilities that even educated consumers often overlook?

A. There are so many of them. I think not enough people ask themselves "What if?" What if I became disabled? What if I got sick? What if I lost my job? Is my current will really the last conversation I wanted to have with my family? Those "what if" questions tend to be the source of most people's Achilles' heels, because it's not fun to deal with the issues that revolve around mortality and unpleasant outcomes. The conversation flows naturally when you ask those "what if" questions. In a poll of a group of lawyers I was speaking to, a third of the community did not have a will.

Q. What specific opportunities do you see ahead for consumers? For example, is it still a good time to refinance your home mortgage, or will interest rates move even lower?

A. It's not one size fits all, though if you haven't refinanced the mortgage on your house, you should certainly examine that opportunity at this point.
On the investment side, given the right situation, it can be a tremendous opportunity. Can you afford to take the risk, and can you afford the loss of principal? Someone who needs to depend on a certain amount of income from investments because he no longer is earning an income can't. The person who's in his 30's or in his 40's can afford some economic risks, and historically this would be a good time if he could get past the quarterly or annual volatility. I think we've already seen an influx of people selling different types of investments. 
On a note of caution, investment products that are popular to buy typically tend to be the wrong things to invest in, because the timing is poor. As an example, people buy stocks at the top, and now they are buying long-term high-quality bonds and fixed annuities. But if we're bottoming on interest rates and inflation, these are some of the more risky assets that you can invest in at this time.

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT; 
Just a Surge? Or a Sign That Bulls Are Back?

BYLINE:  By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
FOR months, amid uncertainty over whether the United States would go to war, many investors were reluctant to commit themselves to the stock market.
 Last week, with the war under way, many investors seemed confident that the current conflict would come to a quick end with clear results. 
 Byron R. Wien, senior investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, talked last week about what he expects the war will do for financial markets. Following are excerpts from the conversation:

Q. Investors seem to view this war as a reprise of the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and to believe that markets will react in a similar way. Is that view correct?

A. This is very different from the 1991 war, but I don't know if the investment implications are that different.
Back then, Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait and the whole world thought that was a hostile act that should not be allowed to stand. We were given broad support in the Middle East to rectify that situation, both in terms of countries to put our troops and in financial support. 
Here, from the very beginning, President Bush was determined to create a regime change in Iraq, no matter what the international community thought. The rest of the world would have been satisfied to destroy his weapons and leave his regime in place. The United States was philosophically apart from the rest of the world. Still, in this country, almost everybody expects the war to be short and the market to go up on the basis of that. 

Q. The stock market began to rally before the war began. Do you expect stocks to continue to rise?

A. There are three important characteristics that were in place on March 10.
First, investor sentiment was very weak. Second, valuations were attractive. And, third, pension fund portfolios were out of line with their benchmarks, even though there was no incentive to rebalance. 
Then, suddenly, the stock market went up 8 percent in three days. I think this rally will carry further than the consensus expects. It could be the beginning of another bull market.
The very strong move we have had is actually encouraging, because that is the way important bull markets often start. There will be some pullback, but I am on the bullish side of the consensus. 

Q. Will the market start to worry if this war drags on longer than expected?

A. Time is not as important as casualties. If we spend more time but the casualties don't mount, that is O.K. But if it is short and there are lots of casualties, that is a problem.

Q. Is your optimism about stocks at least partly based on the notion that business conditions will improve after the war?

A. There is a widespread feeling that investors who held back in making commitments and businesses that did not build inventories did so because of uncertainty about the war. Everyone assumed that military victory would happen but that the administrative aspects of the peace might be difficult. If we win the war and have a relatively smooth administrative structure in place, govern the country and keep the tribal factions from attacking each other, that will be good news for the U.S. economy and the world economy. I think that is a reasonable expectation.

Q. Does your optimism extend to corporate earnings?

A. The first-quarter numbers will be disappointing because the economy has been held back by the war and the weather. But the remaining quarters will be positive.
I think people are being very cautious about earnings, but I think earnings are going to come through.

Q. With so many countries opposed to the war, will foreign investors be less willing to finance America's current account deficit?

A. If we win the war, it will be easier to finance the current account deficit. America's pre-eminence will have been established. Uncertainty about the war has been a negative for the dollar, but it has rallied now that we have started to act.

Q. What might surprise the market?

A. Some of the surprises might be that having won the war, we get broad international support in reconstructing Iraq. Another would be that the administration of Iraq doesn't lead to a series of terrorist attacks. That the war does not prove to be a barrier to corporate and individual spending and that the economy, therefore, improves through the remainder of the year.

Q. Do you expect any unpleasant surprises?

A. I think people are focused on the downside. The negatives are well known. The fear is that we have gotten ourselves into another Vietnam, that there is no exit. I don't think that is a real concern. I think we have learned a lot since the 1970's.

ShockNo. 2: Insurance Isn't Enough to Rebuild

BYLINE:  By SUSAN B. GARLAND 

 BODY:
A LITTLE more than a year ago, a wildfire destroyed the 2,250-square-foot house that Robert and Ann Burton owned in Fallbrook, Calif., about an hour north of San Diego. The loss of their home, along with 42 other houses in the area, was devastating enough. But the Burtons said they also had to deal with another shock: their homeowner's insurance policy did not cover the full cost of rebuilding.
 "We trusted the agent to know what the house would be worth," said Mr. Burton, 63, a retired director of student activities at the local high school. Only two years earlier, he and Mrs. Burton, 58, a retired teacher, had moved into the home, which overlooks miles of avocado groves. 
 Many homeowners are under the impression that their insurance will pay the full cost of replacement if their houses sustain extensive damage from fire or other causes. Yet three-quarters of all homes nationwide are undervalued for insurance purposes, by an average of 35 percent, according to a study last year by Marshall & Swift/Boeckh, a firm based in New Berlin, Wis., that provides building cost data to the insurance, construction and appraisal industries. 
In recent years, rising construction costs and property values have increased the cost of replacing a home. From 1996 to 2002, the cost of building a home rose 28 percent in the Northeast and 33 percent in the West, according to the Census Bureau.
Over the same period, many insurance companies, stung by big losses on homeowner policies in the 1990's (in part because of hurricane and wildfire claims), have dropped "guaranteed replacement cost" coverage. In those types of plans, the insurer promises to pay the full cost of restoring a home to its original condition. But such plans do not cover the home's contents.
Most new policies make homeowners responsible for seeing that their coverage reflects rising market values and keeps pace with increases in rebuilding costs. But homeowners often don't realize that.
"So many times, consumers first get their policies when they buy their house, and they don't consider that the replacement and market values of their homes can go up substantially over time," said Madelyn H. Flannagan, a vice president of the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America, based in Alexandria, Va.
These days, most companies offer "extended replacement" instead of guaranteed replacement coverage. These policies insure the home for a specific value, and usually add a 20 percent to 25 percent cushion -- or extended limit -- if reconstruction costs run over. The policies also provide for the loss of contents, covering them at 50 to 75 percent of the value of the home. In addition, insurance companies often include annual adjustments for inflation, in recent years around 2 to 3 percent.
But that may not be enough. Increases in construction costs in a given housing market could far exceed inflation provisions.
The Burtons said they had a bigger extended limit, of 50 percent, on their house. After the fire, Mr. Burton said, a builder who was recommended by the Allstate Insurance Company, his insurer, came in with a reconstruction estimate that was nearly $70,000 more than the policy value, including the 50 percent cushion, that was set by the agent. Mrs. Burton said that the insurer refused to pay anything more than the value stated in the policy, including the cushion, and the couple accepted the decision. Later, she said, representatives from the California Department of Insurance, meeting with some Fallbrook homeowners who also contended that their coverage had fallen short, suggested that their carriers could be accountable if they portrayed themselves as experts in valuing a home.
THE BURTONS and many of their neighbors filed complaints with the insurance department. The couple also filed a lawsuit in November in State Superior Court in San Diego County against Allstate and its agent, contending negligence and fraud. The case, which has been moved to federal court at Allstate's request, is pending, according to Robert J. Wolfe, a lawyer at the Los Angeles firm of Engstrom, Lipscomb & Lack, who is representing the Burtons.
An Allstate spokeswoman, Emily Daly, said it was company policy not to comment on pending litigation. But she said that the company "uses tools that determine that limits are set properly."
The Burtons, meanwhile, said they moved into a nearby condominium for a year and are now staying at a friend's guest house while they wait for their home to be rebuilt. The house, Mr. Burton said, will have the same total square feet as the original home, though without some of its features, like exposed wood beams. He says they will have to spend about $80,000 out of pocket to cover all the rebuilding and landscaping costs.
Robert W. Crine Jr., the president of Marshall & Swift/Boeckh, said insurers have traditionally used a square-foot measurement to set home values, without taking into account cost differences in housing materials -- plaster versus drywall, for example -- and amenities like solid wood floors. He added that more insurance companies, though, were turning to "total component estimating," which analyzes all features of a house, from roofing materials to bathroom tiles. "The system then prices out each characteristic individually," said Mr. Crine, whose company has developed total-component technology for the insurance industry.
Homeowners whose insurers do not use this technology have other options. On their own, they can hire a contractor, an appraiser or an expert in repairing building damage to review all the details of a house and come up with an estimated cost for replacement. A policyholder should consider switching companies, experts say, if the insurer refuses to consider that estimate or insists on a less effective way of setting values, like the square-foot method.
A handful of companies, including Chubb and Fireman's Fund, still offer guaranteed full-replacement policies. Mary Ann Avnet, the vice president for personal insurance at Chubb, said such coverage from Chubb costs about 15 percent more than standard policies, and is aimed mainly at custom homes. Chubb has its own appraisers who inspect each house covered by such a policy, talk to local builders to determine construction costs and set premiums based on that information, she said.
Homeowners should not confuse property value with replacement costs. If houses in a neighborhood are selling for $500,000, the cost to rebuild a particular house could be more or less, depending on construction costs in the area. And policyholders should make sure that they are not insuring the value of the land, which usually runs about 25 percent of the average home price, according to Ms. Flannagan of the independent insurance agents' group. She advises homeowners to check their tax assessments for the breakdown of land and house values. Homeowners do need coverage, though, for landscaping and for debris removal costs, Ms. Avnet added.
Policyholders also need to notify their insurance companies when they renovate. Nearly 60 percent of homeowners who make major structural changes, like remodeling baths or kitchens, fail to update their policies, according to the independent agents' group. Yet, the organization said, one in four remodeling projects increases the value of the home by more than 25 percent.
"Even if I'm only installing new granite counter tops, I would call my agent," said P. J. Crowley, a vice president of the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. "Over time, making improvements of even several thousand dollars can quickly bring you over the limit." 
LOCAL building codes and ordinances should be considered, too. If your house is severely damaged, the local government will probably require you to meet codes for electrical wiring, plumbing and other fixtures when you rebuild. In many cases, homeowner's policies do not cover the extra expense of rebuilding to code unless the policy includes an "ordinance and law" rider.
Jose Gonzales and Mary Linnerooth Gonzales learned that the hard way last year, when a spark from a welder that Mr. Gonzales was using in a home improvement project ignited a trash can filled with dryer lint. The house, in Silver Spring, Md., was owned by Mr. Gonzales's parents, who do not live there. The couple escaped the fire unharmed, but the house, 100 years old and with two bedrooms, was severely damaged.
Mrs. Gonzales said that during the 30 years her in-laws owned the house, their insurance carrier never advised them to buy insurance that would cover the expenses of meeting updated building codes. She said that the insurance company would not pay for the upgrades of wiring, plumbing and structural repairs, which are expected to cost around $12,000, though the couple were still negotiating with the company. "You depend on the insurance company to tell about these things," said Mrs. Gonzales, 28, who works as a nanny. 
It is not unusual to have gaps in home insurance coverage. Policies may exclude damage from the backup of sewers and drains, although such coverage is available at an extra charge. The best way to become aware of what is and is not covered is to read a policy's fine print. 
Of course, insuring for full replacement or adding riders raises premiums. As it is, the cost of the average homeowner policy is expected to rise 9 percent this year, after an 8 percent increase in 2002, according to the Insurance Information Institute. But instead of reducing coverage, Mr. Crowley advised, homeowners may want to raise the deductible. By increasing the deductible to $1,000 from zero, he said, a homeowner may save up to 25 percent on the premium.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2004 Chrysler Pacifica; 
A Wagon-Van-Sport Tourer Is Born

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: KEY WEST, Fla. 

 BODY:
LONG road trips tend to generate inane conversations. One such discussion, which took place on my family's recent spring break trip to the Florida Keys, reminded me of the scene in "Stand by Me" in which the film's coming-of-age characters pondered what sort of animal Goofy, the Disney character, was supposed to be.
 As we drove south in a 2004 Chrysler Pacifica, I started the debate by asking, "What kind of vehicle is this?" 
 "It's a sport utility," my mother insisted. To which I countered, "No, it's a station wagon." My daughter was emphatic that the Pacifica is not a wagon, so I argued that it is a minivan, which is how she categorizes another hard-to-place Chrysler, the PT Cruiser. 
If our fellow travelers had included the DaimlerChrysler engineers or designers who developed the Pacifica -- they were asked to come up with the Next Big Thing, beyond the minivan and the S.U.V. -- they would have insisted it is a "sport tourer." That is a label the company also applies to two other soon-to-come vehicles -- the sporty Dodge Magnum and luxurious Mercedes-Benz GST.
For lack of a better term, it is certainly safe to call the Pacifica a crossover, one of the new wave of vehicles that mix characteristics of -- take your pick -- sedans, wagons, vans, S.U.V.'s, sports cars and pickups. The Acura MDX, BMW X5 and Lexus RX 330 are conceptually similar, as are the Infiniti FX45 and the Cadillac SRX that will arrive this summer.
Chrysler marketing executives estimate that 2.7 million buyers shift in or out of sport utility vehicles, minivans and sedans every year. It is among this group, they say, that the Pacifica will find its buyers.
So the important question is not what the Pacifica is, but how well it fulfills its purpose: to be a cool alternative to the minivan that can also substitute for a sport utility. Our Florida trip -- with two adults, two children and eight bags of varying size -- put the new Chrysler to the test.
We began our road trip at the Fort Lauderdale airport, which was the only place all week where the silver test vehicle received the slightest bit of attention. Having read about the Pacifica, a group of car-savvy older men gathered around. They found it attractive and were dazzled by the power liftgate. But they thought the price ($37,510 as tested) was a little steep.
I agree that the Pacifica is attractive and classy. I thought so when it was shown as a design study two years ago at the Detroit auto show. (A caveat: I'm not fond of the grille, which will be worn by future Chryslers. It resembles the PT Cruiser's but seems disproportionately large.)
The Pacifica's design inspires alliteration: to me, it seems solid, substantial and secure, with a strong presence. And it is surprisingly large: 10 inches longer than Chrysler's short-wheelbase minivans. The safe-and-secure message is driven home by the expanse of metal along its sides -- in profile, the car is one-third glass and two-thirds sheet metal.
Chrysler expects the Pacifica to perform well on government crash tests. The body structure is solid, and the track is wide for stability. Safety features, in addition to dual-stage front air bags, include a knee bag for the driver and a curtain bag that runs the length of the cabin.
The Pacifica sits lower than either a minivan or S.U.V., making it easy to get in or out. Yet the seats are rather high, providing the Road Commander feel that many people like in S.U.V.'s. The Pacifica has three rows of two seats each; the front two rows are divided by consoles.
Spread over all three rows, everyone was comfortable on the trip to Key West and back. We didn't need the optional heated seats, part of the $500 cold-weather option package, but I surely appreciated the power-adjustable pedals, which are standard.
The power liftgate ($400) proved handy as we loaded and unloaded luggage along our route. My son occupied half the third-row seat, behind which we tucked a garment bag; that's about all that would fit there.
We folded the other half of the third seat and put our small wheeled suitcases there. My daughter took up one of the second-row seats, and the other one held baggage. Those second-row seats also fold and tumble forward for access to the third row.
With all the seats folded, the floor is flat -- ideal for carrying large purchases from the warehouse store. Still, we concluded that a minivan remains the ideal vehicle for family vacations and car-pooling duties that include a lot of sports equipment. The Pacifica works better to transport people who don't carry quite so much stuff.
There are a lot of useful storage units inside, including a large center console, the requisite cup holders and nooks and crannies for pocket change and cellphones.
The interior is attractive and comfortable with luxury touches like a leather-wrapped shift knob with chrome trim, silver accents on the doors and instrument panel and wood-look trim (it is actually aluminum subjected to a lithographic process) that sweeps from the instrument panel along the doors into the second row. Still, the minute I slid into the driver's seat, my eyes were drawn to shiny plastic trim that screamed "cheap" on the test car, which was an early production model.
Although the Pacifica is large and roomy, it feels relatively small and nimble. The smooth ride was first-rate.
The Pacifica is the first Chrysler developed in cooperation with Mercedes-Benz. Mike Donoughe, the engineer who is vice president for Chrysler's family vehicle product team, spent three years studying Mercedes processes in Germany, and he took advantage of that company's sophisticated driving-simulation computers.
While he insists that the Pacifica shares no parts with any Mercedes, it rides on an architecture and rear suspension borrowed in concept, though not in specific components, from the full-size E-Class.
As our Pacifica cruised alongside the Atlantic Ocean, my son volunteered that the ride in the back was very smooth. The cabin was so quiet at cruising speeds that we could converse in normal tones from front to back.
The Pacifica's engine is the same 3.5-liter V-6 used in the Chrysler 300M sedan, rated at 250 horsepower and 250 pounds-feet of torque. Although noisy under hard acceleration, the V-6 was more than adequate on our trip, though Florida's flat, straight roads didn't pose much of a challenge. Given the Pacifica's considerable weight -- 4,675 pounds -- I wondered if the wagon might need more power in the mountains.
Fuel economy is better than that of most sport utilities, at 17 m.p.g. in town and 22 on the highway, but still not great. Chrysler suggests the use of midgrade (89 octane) gasoline. A 23-gallon tank makes fueling stops infrequent but expensive.
The engine is paired with a four-speed automatic transmission that has an AutoStick feature, which permits the driver to shift manually. Most crossovers in this class offer five-speed automatics.
The Pacifica comes with either front drive or all-wheel drive, with equipment specific to each version. My all-wheel-drive test model faced few challenges beyond the sand on the roadside as we pulled away from the International House of Pancakes. But the brakes, which have a standard antilock feature, got a workout in the unpredictable stop-and-go traffic through the Keys, and they performed competently.
Quality has long been a concern with Chrysler's cars and trucks, but the company has clearly made big improvements since the takeover by Daimler-Benz. The test car seemed fine, aside from the plastic trim that I disliked, and management has worked hard to improve quality at the Pacifica assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, where minivans are also made.
In addition to the cold-weather package and the power liftgate, the test Pacifica had optional leather seats ($890), an upgraded stereo system ($700), a power sunroof ($895) and fancy 17-inch wheels ($750). It also can be ordered with commercial-free Sirius satellite radio and UConnect technology, which allows hands-free use of the driver's mobile phone inside the cabin and up to 30 feet away.
But the tested Pacifica lacked the two options I had hoped for: a DVD screen that flips down from the ceiling to keep children entertained and an innovative navigation system that puts route maps right in front of the driver -- inside the face of the speedometer.
The Pacifica starts at $31,239 with front-wheel drive; a loaded version hits $42,000. That is pretty pricey for family transportation, compared with the typical $26,000 transaction price for minivans. Chrysler plans an entry-level Pacifica later this year that will have a base price below $30,000.
For relatively affluent families, the Pacifica seems like eminently sensible transportation. It is roomy, versatile and sporty, and it drives quite nicely. Its species may remain a matter of debate, but it is anything but goofy.

INSIDE TRACK: Less minivan, more margaritaville.

HEADLINE: Investing; 
Utility Dividends Aren't a Sure Thing

BYLINE:  By TIM GRAY 

 BODY:
FOR decades, most electric power companies havedelivered a steady stream of dividends. But over the last year, many shareholders have learned to their chagrin that dividends don't come with a guarantee.
 At least 13 energy companies with major electric utility divisions, including American Electric Power of Columbus, Ohio, the country's largest power generator, have announced in the last 12 months that they are reducing or suspending dividends. And analysts and portfolio managers have cited others, like Duke Energy of Charlotte, N.C., and TECO Energy of Tampa, Fla., as companies that may be unable to maintain theirs. 
 The reductions are rooted in the 1990's, when power companies tried to attract investors by embracing deregulation and seeking new ways to grow. "The new economy was a very painful experience for these guys," said Paul Patterson, an analyst at Glenrock Associates in New York. "Their stocks went to incredible lows, and it wasn't like they'd done anything wrong but being boring." 
Dullness, however, is not much of a stock market liability these days, especially if that means a company can pay its shareholders. Once-dowdy dividends have found new allure. President Bush has called for eliminating taxes on them, and if Congress agrees, "a good solid utility stock becomes a very good alternative to a municipal bond for individual investors," said Mark Luftig, co-manager of the Strong Dividend Income fund. "And if we get inflation," he added, "it'd be a heck of a lot better because bond prices will go down."
Dividends can bolster a portfolio's total return. In the 1990's, technology stocks, which typically do not pay dividends, overshadowed dividend-paying companies like utilities. But investors' ardor for technology blinded them to a benefit of dividends: an income stream even when the company's stock price sinks.
Many electric companies' dividends remain as reliable as the power flowing through their high-tension wires. The Edison Electric Institute, a trade group, found that four-fifths of the largest power companies raised or maintained their dividends in 2002. Bill Brier, the institute's vice president for communications, expects similar numbers this year. 
SUZANNE SMITH, a director at Standard & Poor's Rating Services in New York, said "a perfect storm" in the industry had buffeted the companies that had to suspend or reduce their dividends.
The bankruptcy of Enron, an energy trader, focused public attention on the industry's troubles. Credit-rating agencies redoubled their scrutiny of power companies.
Their reviews came as the companies were grappling with lower prices for their power because of the sluggish economy -- and their own mistakes.
Facing deregulation, many had scurried to build plants that would sell power on the open market. Known as merchant plants, their electricity rates are determined in the marketplace and are not set by state regulators.
The new merchant plants created a power surplus, pushing down prices. And companies took on short-term debt to pay for construction. Standard & Poor's estimates that $40 billion in electric-power debt will come due in 2003, and that $50 billion more will be due over the next three years. 
Together, lower power prices and greater indebtedness caused a cash shortage.
Dividend cuts offered a reprieve. "One thing about cutting the dividend is that the benefit is immediate," Ms. Smith said. "Asset sales can take time and come in at a lower price than you expected." 
American Electric, for example, proposed to reduce its dividend this year to 35 cents a quarter, from 60 cents, as one of a series of measures aimed at paying off debt, said Susan Tomasky, the executive vice president and chief financial officer. In April, its board will vote on the reduction, which could save more than $335 million a year. American Electric is also raising cash by selling assets and issuing more stock -- diluting the holdings of existing shareholders -- and it is cutting costs, by eliminating 1,300 jobs. 
At CenterPoint Energy in Houston, a syndicate of banks required the cut in the dividend -- to 10 cents from 16 cents a quarter -- as a condition of refinancing $3.85 billion in debt, said Gary Whitlock, executive vice president and chief financial officer. The company announced the refinancing on Feb. 28.
"That night, we had a glass of Champagne," though in a plastic-foam cup, Mr. Whitlock said. 
Money managers say individual investors should consider the same sorts of factors that managers do in assessing the stability of a dividend. 
Take time to understand the company, said Bob Becker, manager of the Franklin Utilities fund. If the bulk of its sales come from selling regulated power, it should be able to maintain its dividend. Mr. Becker also likes to see relatively low indebtedness; a debt-to-capital ratio of less than 55 percent is his touchstone. 
Judy Saryan, manager of the Eaton Vance Utilities fund, suggested that investors also check two key ratios -- the dividend yield and the payout ratio. The yield is calculated by dividing a company's annual dividend by its stock price, while the payout ratio is the annual dividend divided by the company's annual per-share earnings. 
Ms. Saryan said the median yield among the dividend-paying electric utilities she follows was about 5 percent. A yield of 7.5 percent or more is often the market's way of saying a dividend may not be sustainable. (The yield rises when the share price falls.)
The average payout ratio among Ms. Saryan's companies is about 55 percent. She worries when that ratio hits 70 percent.
Companies that money managers believe will maintain their dividends include the FPL Group, based in Juno Beach, Fla.; the Southern Company, in Atlanta; and Exelon, in Chicago.
Companies that may have trouble include Duke and TECO, in the view of many portfolio managers. Both have higher-than-average yields because of slumping share prices. Duke's yield is 7.14 percent; TECO's is 12.97 percent. Duke's annual dividend is $1.10 a share; TECO's is $1.42. 
Executives at both companies have said repeatedly that their dividends are safe. 
LATE on March 12, Moody's Investors Service said that it was considering a downgrade of TECO's debt because of concerns about the company's cash flow, and the stock fell 7.5 percent the next day over worries about its ability to maintain the dividend. The stock has since gained some ground, and closed on Friday at $10.95. Laura Plumb, a spokeswoman for TECO, said it would not comment about the dividend until its next meeting with analysts on Friday. 
Robert Brace, Duke's executive vice president and chief financial officer, reaffirmed its commitment to its dividend. "We've been very clear," he said, "that paying the dividend is what we intend to do." 
Duke's two main businesses -- Duke Power, a regulated utility, and Duke Energy Gas Transmission, a natural-gas pipeline company -- will produce 80 percent, or $2.8 billion, of the company's earnings before interest and taxes in 2003, which should provide plenty of cash for debt and dividends, he said. 
The spate of dividend cuts has made at least one company, dismissed as stodgy not long ago, look smart today. For years, Progress Energy in Raleigh, N.C., was overshadowed by Duke. Analysts rhapsodized about Duke's innovations and its efficiency as a nuclear-plant operator. They chided Progress for its less-efficient operations. Duke built many merchant plants and created a hefty energy trading operation. Progress stayed mostly with generating regulated power. 
For years, Duke's stock outperformed Progress's. But lately it has lagged behind. In the last 12 months, Duke's shares have slipped 57 percent, compared with a loss of 14 percent for Progress's. 
While Duke has been dogged by dividend questions, Progress is raising its dividend by 6 cents a share, to $2.24 annually, the 15th consecutive annual increase. 
John R. Kirwan, an investment broker in Matthews, N.C., with Carolina Financial Partners, said he wished that Duke had chosen the more conservative path.
About a third of his clients hold Duke stock -- "some of them 25 shares, some of them thousands" -- and "they've taken a 50 percent hit in the head in the last six months," he said.

Technology Companies Take Hope in Charity

BYLINE:  By SUSAN E. REED 

 BODY:
HEWLETT-PACKARD has been working with the United Nations on ways to standardize and computerize the small-loan industry in the developing world. The goal, the company says, is to expand a limited range of loans financed by a hodgepodge of nonprofit groups.
 On the surface, it seems odd that Hewlett-Packard, with annual revenue of $72 billion, would care about such loans, which can provide, for example, $50 in start-up money for a Bangladeshi entrepreneur to buy a cellular phone or a milking cow. 
 But Hewlett-Packard sees a direct connection between the company's long-term future and such loans, known as microfinance. Debra L. Dunn, the senior Hewlett-Packard executive in charge of its philanthropy, said a small-loan program could enable consumers in the developing world to afford some of the company's computers, printers or digital cameras. 
"We certainly have sales opportunities within the microfinance industry, but the other motivation is to really catalyze more economic development in these areas, which just grows markets in general," Ms. Dunn said.
Hewlett-Packard's interest in microfinance is part of a trend in the technology industry to expand into emerging markets, where corporate collaboration with nonprofit organizations and foreign governments is becoming a new way of doing business.
Microsoft pledged more than $100 million in technology and training last year as part of a deal to put government services online in Mexico. Cisco Systems, the leading maker of Internet hardware, relies upon nonprofit organizations to run its 10,000 networking academies, which train college and high school students in 150 countries to create computer networks. And Cisco and Hewlett-Packard donated expertise to a recently announced White House program of technology aid to developing countries in the Middle East and Africa -- part of the Bush administration's effort to improve its negative image among predominantly Muslim countries that oppose the war in Iraq.
Bridging the so-called digital divide by connecting billions of people to the Internet has become an important business objective in the American technology industry, which has been struggling with recession since the dot-com collapse three years ago. In 2000, Hewlett-Packard's chief executive, Carleton S. Fiorina, pledged $1 billion "on behalf of itself and its partners" to help the world's poorest people gain economic power. 
Hewlett-Packard's overseas philanthropy declined last year as the company donated more to American charities after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. This year, amid a rise in anti-Americanism, the company intends to increase its international giving. "In times like these," Ms. Dunn said, "global citizenship is perhaps more important than ever."
The company also intertwines its philanthropy with business interests abroad. It invested, for example, $3 million in a project in Kuppam, India, in the eastern state of Andhra Pradesh. The project supports computer services provided by World Corps, a nonprofit group, while Hewlett-Packard employees work with Kuppam residents to understand what types of computerized information or services might be useful to the area's 350,000 inhabitants -- many of whom earn less than a dollar a day, are illiterate and have never owned a telephone.
"Sometimes, putting computers in front of them freaked them," said Maureen Conway, Hewlett-Packard's vice president for emerging markets. 
But she said the company had made progress. After hearing how residents had wasted hours going to the wrong medical clinics, Hewlett-Packard put information about Kuppam's health services on a database that users could access through World Corps. Those needing health care can save time by finding out in advance what clinic will best serve their needs.
The Kuppam project, and a similar one in Mogalakwena, South Africa, convinced the company that it could sell some products, like its $200 iPAQ, a hand-held computer, in these markets -- if customers could borrow the money to buy them.
HEWLETT-PACKARD describes such deals as part of its "enlightened self-interest" -- economic stimulants that it hopes will create more consumer demand. Some experts in corporate philanthropy are not yet convinced.
"It's too early to tell if companies are simply pushing technologies on naive populations or if the products they sell will ultimately increase productivity," said Craig Warren Smith, a former philanthropy consultant who wrote "Digital Corporate Citizenship: The Business Response to the Digital Divide" (Indiana University Center on Philanthropy, 2002).
Not all companies are as open as Hewlett-Packard about the business benefits of philanthropy in the developing world. I.B.M., for example, would comment only on its purely philanthropic efforts, like educational support and putting the treasures of Egypt online. "Philanthropy is so sacred and so important to our employees," Donna Mattoon, a spokeswoman, said.
There is conflict within I.B.M. over the direction of its philanthropy, said Dwight F. Burlingame, associate executive director of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, which researches trends in corporate giving. "I think it's the struggle between what they think they should be doing, what their public image should be and what they're actually doing," he said.
Under corporate tax laws, companies cannot benefit directly from tax-deductible philanthropy, but they do benefit indirectly. A spokeswoman for Intel, Tracy Koon, said the company's core philanthropy program, which trains elementary school teachers how to use computers, increases "technical fluency around the world," which "is always tied to our business."
Using philanthropy or not, technology companies have extended their reach abroad through partnerships with nonprofit organizations. Cisco Systems has invested $200 million over six years in its networking academies and never made a profit on them, said a spokeswoman, Abby Smith. The academies are not considered philanthropic, but they rely upon nonprofit cooperation to grow.
To expand the program to Afghanistan, Cisco worked with the United Nations Development Program. To bring the academies to Eastern and Central Europe, it got a grant from the Open Society Institute, run by the financier George Soros.
The academies provide another dividend: they are part of Cisco's portfolio of good will when negotiating with countries like China or Indonesia, said Mr. Smith, the author. As a result, he added, Cisco "is no longer a company that makes just switchers and routers for the Internet; its strongest business units are in e-government and e-learning."

Its work includes a computer project in Magalawena, South Africa, above, and a digital photography program in Karnataka, India.

HEADLINE: The Backlash Grows Against Celebrity Activists 

BYLINE:  By WARREN ST. JOHN 

 BODY:
FOR a few days after the Dixie Chicks' lead singer, Natalie Maines, told a London audience, "Just so you know, we're ashamed the president of the United States is from Texas," there was not a ripple about the remark. The American ambassador to Britain, William S. Farish, was at the show on March 10, and made it a point to greet the Texas trio at a reception afterward. Though six critics reviewed the concert, only one mentioned the comment in print.
 Four days later, all that had changed. Reports of the remark spread to the United States through Web sites -- notably the Drudge Report and a conservative site called Freerepublic.com -- and in no time, the Dixie Chicks, who had been riding the top of the charts with their album "Home" after winning Grammy Awards in February, found themselves the subject of radio boycotts and public CD burnings. Ms. Maines apologized for the remark, but by week's end, the boycotts had contributed to a 20 percent drop in airplay of the band's music. 
 For celebrities considering taking a public stance on the Iraq war these days, and in particular using the platform that the Academy Awards presents to address an audience of millions, the Dixie Chicks episode has become a cautionary tale. 
While politically active stars have long provoked strong reactions from those who disagree with them -- think of Jane Fonda, Edward Asner and Charlton Heston -- opposition to celebrity activists has never been more vocal or better organized. Web sites with names like Boycott-hollywood.us and Famousidiot.com are spearheading e-mail and telephone campaigns against stars and, in the case of television performers, the companies that advertise on their shows. Together with talk radio and evening political talk shows, the online organizing has created a formidable gantlet for celebrities who choose to make their politics known.
The movement to take aim at celebrities has some unlikely champions. After watching the actor Martin Sheen, star of "The West Wing," denounce an invasion of Iraq on television last December, Lori Bardsley, 38, a homemaker in Summerfield, N.C., started an online petition, Citizens Against Celebrity "Pundits" at ipetitions.com. The petition now has more than 100,000 signatures.
"That evening I was very angry and I knew I wasn't the only one in the country who would be," Ms. Bardsley said. "Many Americans have felt this for a long time."
Neal Gabler, an author who has written extensively about society's attitude toward celebrity, said that the same public that worships stars as performers can turn against them when they express opinions like ordinary people. 
"Entertainers symbolize something about American life that many Americans resent," he said. "They have so much money and they're so conspicuous about it. The idea is that all celebrities are spoiled and naive and fundamentally not serious. They're dabblers."
Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, a conservative journal, echoed this view. 
"Subliminally it bothers people that these are famous, rich, celebrated people who America has treated extremely well," he said. 
Questioning the patriotism of Hollywood activists is a favorite theme of celebrity-bashing Internet sites. Famousidiot.com is a case in point. Under the banner, "They don't speak for US," the site ranks celebrities according to the number of "anti-Americanisms" they've supposedly uttered.
"While America faces monumental challenges at home and abroad," the site declares, "they feel compelled to leave their mansions and attack the country that makes it possible for them to do so."
Janeane Garofalo, an actress who has been outspoken in opposition to the war, argues that the antipatriotism charge is meant to "shut down debate and thwart First Amendment rights."
"We are extremely supportive of the troops," she said. "Anyone who says yes to peace and diplomacy is saying yes to the troops."
Ms. Garofalo said that the news media interest in celebrities who oppose the war has the effect of trivializing the antiwar movement. There are plenty of celebrities who are in favor of the war, she argues, but they rarely come in for abuse. 
"If all the voices against the war were scholars and academics and politicians, and all those who were for the war were Ted Nugent and Bruce Willis and country-western singers, then you'd see the polls start to shift," she said.
The larger question might be, Why do celebrity opinions get attention at all? Bill O'Reilly, host of "The O'Reilly Factor" on Fox News and a frequent critic of politically active celebrities, says that while few of his viewers are swayed by celebrities' opinions, they nevertheless are intrigued by them.
"People love emotional conflict," he said. "Once you have a famous person who takes a stand, then you can feel one way or another about that stand. If Barbra Streisand says it, you know her -- you get involved."
Most of the celebrity activists singled out for abuse on the Web these days are those opposing the war in Iraq and espousing other liberal causes. Eric Alterman, the author of a new book called "What Liberal Media? The Truth About Bias and the News" (Basic Books, $25), argues that conservatives are better organized at calling attention to celebrity activists they oppose than liberals are. He says grass-roots conservative Web sites inform talk radio, which in turn feeds the evening political talk-show circuit. 
"It's a food chain," Mr. Alterman said. "You start out with a few activist types. It goes through the Internet Web sites, then it gets picked up by the networks and reporters. It becomes a perpetual motion machine."
Simon Renshaw, the manager of the Dixie Chicks, said the backlash against the band was not a spontaneous, widespread outburst, but instead was led by a small group of activists, beginning with Freerepublic.com. Mr. Renshaw said the phenomenon even has a name -- getting "freeped," slang for being deluged with angry e-mail messages from users of the site. He said the band's Web site and e-mail server crashed because of the traffic.
"The morning-drive talk-show guys -- they get a few e-mails and phone calls, then they jump on it," Mr. Renshaw said. "They get a few people incensed and the whole thing starts to snowball. Snowball it has."
Some celebrity activists say the e-mail and telephone campaigns push the line between merely spirited debate and harassment. David Clennon, an actor on the CBS show "The Agency," about the C.I.A., said that after opposing the war on Sean Hannity's conservative radio show, he became the object of a campaign to get him fired. "I was upset and fearful and angry to be targeted in that way," Mr. Clennon said.
Mike Farrell, the actor who played B. J. Hunnicut on "M*A*S*H" and who is outspoken in support of liberal causes, said such tactics amount to "an orchestrated attempt to undermine free speech and the right to dissent." "If they want to call me a Saddam lover that's their right," he said. "But if they set out to affect me professionally, that's different."
Mr. Lowry of National Review is not sympathetic to that argument. "This is what they always say," he said. "They have a free speech right to criticize America at a time of war, but if anyone criticizes them, then gee whiz, they're being violated. They need to toughen up."
For all the talk of boycotts and damaging careers, though, there's little evidence that the campaigns have significant economic impact. While the Dixie Chicks suffered the drop in airplay, their album is at No. 4 on the Billboard charts. Many shows on their coming tour are sold out, Mr. Renshaw said. Mr. Clennon, the "Agency" actor, still has his job. Ms. Streisand, Robert Redford and Martin Sheen have long been singled out for their political activism, and none can be said to have fallen on hard times. 
Mr. Farrell said that the campaigns may even help the careers of some actors. "It's an industry that's sensitive to public expressions of favor and disfavor," he said. "But it's also an industry that traffics in exploitation, so it may make someone more attractive."

For Bond Investors, the Risks May Be Close to Home

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
MUNICIPAL bond investors are doing well this year. But these investors, particularly those with bonds issued by New York and other states with big budget deficits, may be in for an unhappy surprise. 
 This is not a warning that investors will leave the haven of bonds for stocks -- causing interest rates to rise -- if the war in Iraq ends in a quick victory for the United States. In fact, rates have already been rising, with the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note up four-tenths of a point in two weeks, to 4.10 percent. 
 Nor is this a cautionary note that the economy is likely to get back on track after an American victory, pushing interest rates higher as business investment rebounds and demand for credit rises.
Both these postwar outcomes have been considered for months by money managers and smart investors, so any resulting spurt in interest rates, and an associated decline in bond prices, should be no shock.
But not all investors have focused on state budget deficits -- which are forecast to total more than $80 billion in the 2004 fiscal year. These deficits have yet to be reflected in the pricing of some states' municipal bonds. When the gravity of the problem sinks in, these bonds should falter.
With a total return of 0.74 percent this year through Thursday for Lehman Brothers' municipal bond index, investors are not worrying yet. That return beats Treasuries, which have a negative return of 0.10 percent, and is better than the 0.45 percent return for mortgage-backed securities. It is just a quarter of a percentage point less than the return for investment-grade bonds before accounting for munis' tax benefits, which would make the taxable equivalent return on the Lehman municipal bond index even higher.
Bonds issued by troubled states like New York are doing relatively well right now, and that is the problem. According to a performance comparison by Peter J. DeGroot, a senior vice president in the Municipal Index and Strategies Group at Lehman, 10-year general obligation bonds for the state have a price return -- from the rising price of the bonds alone -- of 0.81 percent this year through February, which is not far off the price return of 1 percent for 10-year general obligation bonds nationwide. In the last six months, the price return on these same New York State bonds is 1.31 percent, versus the nationwide performance of 0.77 percent. (Using price return reflects demand for the bonds and weeds out states that have a better total return just because they pay higher interest rates to sell them.)
New York State has been attractive to investors, despite a projected budget deficit of $2.2 billion for the fiscal year that ends on March 31, and $9.3 billion for the next year. Gov. George E. Pataki and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver both want to borrow billions with new bonds to help bridge the budget gap but are deadlocked over how to borrow. And New York has the third-lowest credit rating among the 50 states, behind California and Louisiana.
The strong performance of the state's bonds so far is partly attributable to the high yields the state has offered to sell them, because of its poor budget history and because it issued more bonds last year than any other state but California.
Among the other nine states with the biggest projected budget deficits, six -- Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota -- have bonds that have outperformed the national average price return over the last six months. The three underperformers are California, Massachusetts and New Jersey.
But a look at New York City and California bonds show what can happen when investors digest bad deficit news. Over the last six months, the price return on 10-year New York City bonds is a loss of 0.93 percent, while California 10-year bonds show a price loss of 1.21 percent.
The budget problems of New Jersey are beginning to sink in with investors. The price gain is 0.42 percent over the last six months and just 0.09 percent for the first two months of 2003.
So investors beware. There is more out there than the war with Iraq that could upset your expectations.

PERSON: Kevin E. Benson 

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
Changing Lanes, and Countries

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
GIVEN Kevin E. Benson's passion for racing cars, his job as chief executive of Laidlaw Inc. may seem like life in a very slow lane. Laidlaw owns the Greyhound Lines bus company and is one of North America's biggest operators of school buses and public transit systems.
 But Mr. Benson, who became the chief executive at Laidlaw last September, is facing a pulse-racing few months as the company prepares to emerge in mid-April from almost two years of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. 
 The company is based in Burlington, Ontario, southwest of Toronto, but it does 90 percent of its business in the United States, through five subsidiaries located there. Those units filed for bankruptcy in United States courts at the same time the parent filed for bankruptcy protection under Canadian law here.
Mr. Benson is moving swiftly to prepare for life after the company's bankruptcy -- and after Canada. Laidlaw, which for 79 years was one of Canada's bluest-chip companies, will reincorporate in Delaware and change its name to Laidlaw International. The head office will move to Naperville, Ill., a suburb of Chicago, where Mr. Benson and the company's chief financial officer, Douglas A. Carty, are already based.
In a brief phone conversation, Mr. Benson declined to discuss Laidlaw's situation or plans, saying he did not want to jeopardize negotiations with creditors and bondholders. But once the company emerges from Chapter 11, he said, "we'll have lots to say."
"I'm boring, but the company's pretty interesting," he added.
An accountant by training, Mr. Benson immigrated to Canada from South Africa in the 1970's. Now 56 and a grandfather (he has three grown children, two sons and a daughter), he has held senior positions at several big Canadian companies, most recently as chief executive of the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, an auto insurance company owned by the provincial government. He left that job after eight months to pursue "a unique opportunity" at Laidlaw. Two months later, the government squelched speculation that it planned to sell the insurer to investors.
Earlier in his career, Mr. Benson was the last chief executive of Canadian Airlines International, which was Canada's second-biggest airline before it was acquired by Air Canada in 2001.
Roland Dorsay, who worked with Mr. Benson at Canadian Airlines as director of international affairs and is now an aviation consultant in Ottawa, said his former boss "accomplished as much as could be accomplished, given that the airline was in trouble when he got there."
Mr. Dorsay recalled Mr. Benson's success in persuading the airline's employees to accept pay cuts and other concessions. "He was very straightforward with everyone," Mr. Dorsay said. "People learned fairly quickly that what Kevin said was what he meant."
But Mr. Benson's frankness has sometimes worked against him. Fred Lazar, who teaches business strategy at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Toronto, said that Canadian Airlines would have had a better chance of survival had Mr. Benson not frightened away passengers by warning early on that he would close the airline if the unions did not accept pay cuts.
"Canadian began losing market share, especially business travelers," Mr. Lazar said.
Mr. Benson was also criticized as being too quick to bet Canadian Airlines' future on booming business travel to Asia. While Air Canada was building up its business to the United States, after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement promised to increase business links, Mr. Benson focused on adding routes across the Pacific. That backfired when a currency crisis pushed many of that region's fast-growing economies into recession, causing business travel to collapse.
Mr. Benson is Laidlaw's fifth chief executive in 13 years; the turnover reflects the turbulence at the company since it began an aggressive expansion and diversification drive in the 1990's. Moving away from a focus on waste management and school buses, Laidlaw became the biggest ambulance operator in the United States. It added intercity buses with the acquisition of Greyhound Canada in 1997 and Greyhound in the United States in 1999.
A hostile takeover attempt of Safety-Kleen, an industrial waste processor now based in Plano, Tex., failed after questions were raised about Safety-Kleen's accounting. Safety-Kleen filed for Chapter 11 protection in June 2000, about a year before Laidlaw sought bankruptcy protection, and Laidlaw wrote off its 44 percent stake in the company, an investment once valued at more than $1 billion.
Laidlaw and Safety-Kleen's creditors settled their disputes through mediation last July. Laidlaw's creditors agreed to recognize a $225 million claim by Safety-Kleen as part of the restructuring.
EXCEPT for Safety-Kleen, Laidlaw's businesses will look much the same after the restructuring as before. It has three main businesses -- retail bus operations, centered on Greyhound; contract bus operations, mostly for municipalities; and health care transportation.
"This is a company that has been undermanaged," said a member of the bondholder committee, who insisted on anonymity. "The focus was on acquisitions and on financial engineering instead of on running the company."
Soon, it will be up to Mr. Benson, the car-racing enthusiast, to get his bus company back up to speed.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Scott L. Barbee; 
Aegis Value Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
SCOTT L. BARBEE, manager of the $155 million Aegis Value fund, calls himself a "very deep value investor."
 That means, he said, that he tries to buy shares of promising companies at discounts of 40 to 70 percent of what he believes they are worth. "Typically, the smaller the company the bigger the discount we can find because small companies are less picked over than big ones," he said from his office in Arlington, Va. 
 The portfolio, which includes the stocks of many very small companies, or microcaps, has an average market capitalization of $273 million. 
The fund returned 16.2 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, compared with 5.3 percent for funds that buy small value stocks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 14.4 percent, annualized, during that time, according to Morningstar Inc.
The fund lost 8.3 percent in the last 12 months, versus losses of 20.4 percent for its group and 22.6 percent for the S.& P. 500.
Mr. Barbee, 31, is a managing director of Berno, Gambal & Barbee, the fund's adviser, which manages an additional $60 million in assets, mostly for individuals.
To pick the fund's 60 to 70 stocks, he typically searches among domestic companies with market caps of less than $1 billion, checking for those that are trading below book value or at less than eight times their trailing 12-month earnings. About 200 to 300 stocks pass those screens.
He then looks especially at companies that have had share buybacks. "If a company is worth $1 and management uses corporate capital to buy out public shareholders at 50 cents," he said, "nothing can be more accretive to value" for the remaining stockholders.
He also searches for what he calls inflection points -- changes in a company's business that may create future value. These can include new contracts, increased pricing power or consolidation of operations.
He gathers information from quarterly and annual reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and shares information with other value investors; all these steps, he said, are more helpful than the work of Wall Street analysts.
When he interviews management, he said, "I look into the details of the company's business structure" -- at factors like its competitive position, and products and operations.
In analyzing financial statements, he aims to ferret out a company's "hidden assets," like property whose market value significantly exceeds its book value, or "hidden liabilities," like potential lawsuits.
In February 2000, Mr. Barbee began buying shares of the Prime Hospitality Corporation, which operates 230 hotels, including the AmeriSuites and Wellesley Inn and Suites chains. Demand has been soft in the hotel industry since the terrorist attacks of 2001 and the weakening of the economy. As a result, he said, the company's shares trade at a significant discount to the cost of its hotels, which he estimates at $15 a share. Because the company has less debt than rivals do, he said, it can better withstand a long industry downturn. 
He paid $8.76, on average, for the position. The stock is now at $5.80. 
He first bought shares of the American Pacific Corporation in September 2001. The company, based in Las Vegas, makes chemicals used in explosives and propellants. Because about 40 percent of the company's sales are generated by chemicals used in solid rocket fuel for the space shuttle program, Mr. Barbee said, its stock price declined after the the shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas last month. But he expects that shuttle flights could resume in about nine months to a year.
The company's shares trade at $8.59 a share; that is a discount to its tangible book value of $7.78 a share, he said. He paid $8.61, on average, for the position. 
MR. BARBEE called The Andersons Inc., an agribusiness company based in Maumee, Ohio, an "undiscovered gem" of the Midwest. 
The fund began buying shares in July 1998 at $9.58, on average; they are now at $12.63. The stock trades at a discount to its tangible book value of $14.20, he said, partly because management stumbled in 2001 by increasing capacity in its fertilizer processing just as the market contracted. But the fertilizer market is bouncing back this year, Mr. Barbee said, and management has been repurchasing shares since 1996.

YOU can be certain that at least one loser at this year's Academy Awards ceremony will say that it was an honor simply to be nominated. What will go unsaid is that for most films, actors and other nominees, winning is not much more than an honor, either.
 Calculating how much a nomination is worth, economically, is as difficult as finding an empty table at the Vanity Fair Oscar party. But this awards season provides ample evidence that the payoff is often slight. 
 Many of the contenders for acting awards this year -- including Jack Nicholson, Paul Newman, Michael Caine and Meryl Streep -- are established stars and are unlikely to see their salaries rise, studio executives and agents agree. "The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," released in late December like other contenders for best picture, was already a blockbuster; it had $319 million in domestic ticket sales before it received six nominations on Feb. 11. 
And not every nominee benefits from the almost daily barrage of newspaper and television advertising, which has cost the industry as much as $50 million this Oscar season, studio executives estimate. The highly promoted "Gangs of New York," the epic directed by Martin Scorsese, has earned only $6 million at the domestic box office since it was nominated for 10 Oscars, according to Nielsen EDI, which tracks ticket sales. (Its total through March 16 was $76 million.) "Rings" fared better, earning an additional $14 million after it was nominated, yet still a minuscule percentage of its overall box-office take. 
"If you get nominated, it is helpful but it is not the be-all, end-all at the box office," said Scott Stuber, president of production at Universal Studios, which distributed and helped finance "A Beautiful Mind, " last year's winner for best picture. 
While awards are important, said Brian Grazer, a producer of "A Beautiful Mind," "it is curiosity that sells tickets and drives people to see your movie." 
Hollywood executives are already thinking about new financial wrinkles in the Oscar race next year. For one thing, the war in Iraq is sure to wreak havoc on planned releases that may now seem frivolous or in bad taste. In addition, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences plans to hold the Oscar ceremony in late February, cutting by one month the awards season and the time that studios can promote nominations in marketing campaigns.
Many films that made the most money last year didn't lead the academy's list of award nominees. "Spider-Man," which brought in $820 million at the worldwide box office for Columbia Pictures and its parent, Sony Pictures Entertainment, was nominated for only two awards: best sound and best visual effects. "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," which brought in $859 million at the box office worldwide and generated many ancillary products for Warner Brothers, a unit of AOL Time Warner, had no nominations.
"My Big Fat Greek Wedding," an independent film that cost a mere $5 million, earned $241 million domestically (with much of the profit going to producers who included Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson), making it one of the most profitable movies ever. But it was shut out of the Oscars except for a nod for best original screenplay.
"What you saw in 2002 is the academy vote for the more tried and true," said Joe Roth, the founder of Revolution Studios and an academy member. For example, four of the nominees for best actor have already won Oscars in that category, making it harder for new talent to become noticed. 
Major studios are often criticized for staying out of the Oscar fray, focusing instead on fare with mass appeal and leaving art-house film divisions or mini-studios like Miramax Films and DreamWorks SKG to battle over creatively risky, and potentially Oscar-worthy, projects.
Miramax, a part of the Walt Disney Company, has had at least one nominee for best picture for 11 consecutive years. These include the current "Gangs," "Chicago" and "The Hours," which Paramount Pictures helped to finance. DreamWorks, for its part, has had a hand in the most recent winners for best picture: "A Beautiful Mind," which Universal helped finance, and "Gladiator" and "American Beauty." 
"I'm not sure you can count major studios out," said Dawn Taubin, president for theatrical marketing at Warner Brothers. "What's different is how they focus on it." In the case of a popular phenomenon like the "Harry Potter" best sellers, each film's release is a cultural event because of the appeal of the book on which it is based. "Everything is geared to that point in time," Ms. Taubin said.
"The Matrix," with its Christian symbolism and expensive outlay for breathtaking special effects, was as risky in 1999 as "Chicago" or "Gangs" is now, she said. "Chicago" is a musical, a genre that hasn't fared well at the box office in decades. "Gangs" was controversial because of its violence and three-hour running time. "The Matrix" won four Academy Awards (although it was not nominated for best picture), and it has spawned two sequels.
"I think you have to ask 'What does the movie cost?' and 'What is the life beyond the theatrical release?' " Ms. Taubin said. "I think success means different things to different people at different times."
No matter how deserving a nomination for best picture may be, critical acclaim does not always translate into a box-office bonanza. This year, a large selection of more serious fare for adults has made it harder for some films to break out of the pack, according to Harvey Weinstein, the co-founder of Miramax Films.
"The Hours," with nine Oscar nominations, has taken in only $37 million at the domestic box office. (It cost $25 million to make, not including marketing, according to Paramount executives.) And despite its seven nominations, "The Pianist," the World War II tale of a Warsaw ghetto survivor, has earned only $19 million at the domestic box office in limited release, well below its $40 million estimated price; it was distributed by Focus Features. 
AS Jim Gianopulos, chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, put it: "Oscar nominations are rarely, if ever, accidental. They usually go with a remarkable piece of work. That said, we can only make so many movies that are Oscar nominees. The reality is, it takes a lot of different movies to make a business."
With the Oscar ceremony next year now planned for February instead of March, studio executives are already rethinking some basic assumptions about publicizing their potentially award-winning films.
"People are going to have to change their marketing strategies because there will be less time for a movie's popularity to build," said Rick Sands, the chief operating officer at Miramax Films, which received a total of 40 nominations this year. Mr. Sands said Miramax opened "Chicago" on Dec. 27 in only 77 theaters, hoping that good reviews and word of mouth would attract moviegoers. By mid-March, "Chicago" had expanded to 2,600 theaters, with domestic box office revenue reaching $124 million, according to Nielsen EDI.
"The question is, how do you make noise?" Mr. Sands said. "You either have to open sooner or forgo a slow rollout. It will change how Oscar contenders are released."
Films released in December benefit most from a nomination for best picture. Industry analysts suggest that the nomination -- and the ensuing publicity -- can usually add $30 million to box-office receipts in the weeks between a nomination and the ceremonies. Other categories, like best actor or best cinematography, don't spur as much interest from ticket buyers, they say.
But movies released earlier in the year can have a second life in theaters. "American Beauty," the DreamWorks film released in September 1999, which went on to win best picture, was showing in only 10 theaters the day before it was nominated in February 2000, according to DreamWorks executives. After the nomination, the studio rereleased the film in 1,287 theaters, which brought in an additional $56 million.
MANY studios are turning to DVD sales and video rentals to capitalize on Oscar gold, entertainment executives say -- so much so that DVD releases are now tied directly to Oscar campaigns.
Twentieth Century Fox kicked off its 2001 DVD sales campaign for "Moulin Rouge" on Dec. 18, not only in time for some Christmas shopping but also because executives hoped to influence academy voters and review boards. "DVD got it back into the culture, which is critical," said Mike Dunn, president of 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. The strategy worked: "Moulin Rouge" earned eight Oscar nominations. 
After the nominations were announced, sales soared to 175,000 units a week -- up from 50,000 units -- for two consecutive weeks. And after the awards ceremony last March (and even though "Moulin Rouge" was not chosen as best picture) sales jumped to 200,000 units the next week, Mr. Dunn said.
Ann Daly, who oversees animation and home video for DreamWorks, says that there "is a more direct correlation between DVD sales and the academy campaigns than academy campaigns and the box office." For one thing, there are more stores to sell films than theaters to show them. "Now," she said, "there is an emphasis on retail."
So what does an actor have to gain from all this? "It's all new so I can't tell what I will do," said Adrien Brody, the young star of "The Pianist" who captivated critics and audiences with his portrayal of a Polish pianist hiding in a Warsaw ghetto. "I don't delve into that. I have people who take care of that for me. But I think I'm in a better bargaining position than I was before."
Most studio executives are already aware of young talent. But Mr. Grazer, the producer, said he would consider paying a higher salary to an actor with a first-time Oscar nomination. 
Higher pay is already predicted for Chris Cooper, a nominee for best supporting actor for his role as a rogue orchid enthusiast in "Adaptation." The $1 million he is said to have received per film in the past could double or triple, talent agents say.
But a nomination does not guarantee instant riches or off-the-charts success. Salma Hayek, the Mexican actress nominated for "Frida," told reporters in Mexico City last week that while her portrayal of the artist Frida Kahlo was a career high point (she was both the star and a producer), she has yet to see a big payoff.
Remember, too, Cuba Gooding Jr., who won the Oscar for best supporting actor for "Jerry Maguire" in 1996 and popularized the catch phrase "Show me the money!" Hailed then as a hot young talent, his more recent films have included the Disney comedy "Snow Dogs," in which he plays a goofy dentist, and, just this month, "Boat Trip," which chronicles the adventures of a straight man trapped on a gay cruise.
Paul Weitz, who was one of three people nominated for "About a Boy" in the best adapted screenplay category, joked that "everyone in Hollywood, I hear, is overpaid anyway, so I don't think it will help us." Besides, Mr. Weitz added, "I don't want to become addicted to the pay."
ULTIMATELY, though, almost everyone in Hollywood agrees on one thing: if an actor or director does interesting work, it will be noticed, whether or not they take home a golden statuette.
"There is a film about violence in the slums of Rio de Janeiro called 'City of God' which was made by Fernando Meirelles," said Mr. Stuber of Universal. "All the executives I know agree he is intriguing as a filmmaker," he said. If Mr. Meirelles had been nominated, "it wouldn't have mattered because the movie spoke to me. The awards are tremendous accolades, but I would have liked it no matter what."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH; 
War Rally Loses Sight Of Deeper Risks

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
WAGING war against Iraq sure beats waiting for it. 
 Such is the view of United States investors, who have bid up the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by 2.5 percent since the war began on Wednesday night and 7.5 percent for all of last week. Investors seem grateful for reports of successes on the battlefield, given that domestic economic news continues to be grim. 
 Though it is understandable that investors, fed up with a three-year-old bear market, would seize on positive war news as a reason to buy stocks, such a focus is exceedingly narrow. Some market strategists say that it does not take into account some real market risks -- and that it means a return to unreasoned and potentially dangerous speculation. 
"People are too focused on the war," said Richard Bernstein, Merrill Lynch's senior United States strategist. "Jobless claims are over 400,000 for five weeks in a row, and people don't care. The Philadelphia Fed report is bad; people don't care. I think the argument you will hear from most people is the market's going up and the market is telling you something. If that's the justification for why one should be bullish, it shows that speculative fervor has returned to the market." 
Investors may be hoping that history will repeat itself. As James B. Stack, president of InvesTech Research in Whitefish, Mont., noted, military conflicts are often followed by higher stock prices. "We looked at wars and the market, and in almost all cases the market was higher 6 months and 12 months down the road after an initial sell-off," he said. "One important aspect of a conflict is that during times of turmoil, it gravitates the public toward patriotism and that patriotism toward confidence. After the longest bear market in 60 years, what Wall Street needs more than anything is a shot of confidence."
There were also technical aspects to stocks' advances once war seemed certain. Many who had bet against stocks decided to close out their positions rather than be run over by an emotional rally. Investors who had been selling were, at least temporarily, buyers.
Because the market is known for spotting economic rebounds well before they occur, many investors are starting to view the bounce in the S.& P. -- almost 12 percent since March 11 -- as an indication of the long-awaited turn. But such rallies have occurred before, only to fizzle when the weak economy proved unable to sustain them. 
The fact is, the recent momentum in stocks must be backed by higher corporate earnings, which can come only if the economy improves. But corporate spending remains moribund, consumers are nervous, and layoffs keep coming. Stocks are a rare bright spot. Bright, and increasingly expensive.
"ONE could say we're in a growth recession because we're not really experiencing the level of growth to absorb the labor that's available," said Dimitri B. Papadimitriou, an economist and the president of the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. "Since what has been proposed by the president in terms of fiscal stimulus isn't going to have an impact, and my suspicion is the private sector will continue to rein in expenditures, we are on a recession path." 
Perhaps the biggest risk is that consumers will discover the joy of saving. Their spending has kept the economy afloat, but that pattern may be winding down. In a study by NPD Group, a market research company, only 14 percent of consumers said they plan to spend more than usual this spring; 41 percent will spend less. 
Crushing consumer debt levels may be forcing these cutbacks. Another likely culprit is continued layoffs. "The debt burden at the corporate level may have peaked," said William W. Priest, a managing partner at Steinberg Priest & Sloane Capital Management in New York. "But at the consumer level it's been masked by rising home values. I think unemployment at the end of this year will be higher than it is today. We are going to struggle most of this year with the fact that final demand will be below most expectations; corporate earnings will be up but probably below expectations." 
Consumers seem frustrated about their options. In a survey released on Wednesday, the Conference Board said that 62 percent of consumers rated the investment environment as bad, and that 65 percent expected no change six months from now. Fourteen percent expected investment conditions to worsen, up from 11 percent in September, and 69 percent didn't plan to invest in stocks in the next six months.
Money flowing into mutual funds has been confirming these sentiments. Bond funds are attracting far more money than stock funds. And when investors do put money into stock funds, they are more likely to be funds investing in foreign companies. AMG Data Services said that of the $2.1 billion in net cash inflows to stock funds for the week that ended Wednesday, 85 percent had gone into international and global funds. 
Consumers' aversion to domestic stocks may be a result of the perception that corporate earnings cannot be trusted, even now. In the past year and a half, investors have seen repeated accusations of fraud at some of the nation's largest companies, but this storm has yet to pass. In a case brought last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission contended that HealthSouth, a giant health care provider, and some of its executives had committed $1.4 billion in accounting fraud since 1999. 
Even if corporate earnings rise in 2003, exacting investors will reduce the reported figures to account for stock options that companies dispense but do not yet show up as a cost. David Zion, an accounting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said options costs, if counted, could take 10 to 15 percent off S.& P earnings this year. 
Chief financial officers are increasingly worried about the economy's prospects. In a survey of 186 finance officers last week by Financial Executives International and Duke University, 45 percent said they felt less optimistic. Three months earlier, only 15 percent said that.
All these factors, said Mr. Bernstein, of Merrill, mean that investors should sell into the rallies that euphoria over the war may produce. He said he was mystified that investors seemed to think that success in Iraq could remove geopolitical risks from the investment equation. "We think we're entering a 10- to 15-year period of substantial change in geopolitics, similar to the fall of the Berlin Wall or the demise of the Soviet Union," he said. "But this time we're in the middle of it. We are the target, and we are viewed by much of the world as the instigator. What a change in geopolitics that is." And one that carries very long-term risk.

HEADLINE: Who Will Put Iraq Back Together? 

BYLINE:  This article was reported by Richard A. Oppel Jr., Diana B. Henriques and Elizabeth Becker, and was written by Ms. Henriques. 

 BODY:
WAR began last week. Reconstruction starts this week.
 That, at least, is how it looks to government contract officers, who in the coming days plan to give American companies the first contracts to rebuild Iraq, a task that experts say could eventually cost $25 billion to $100 billion. It would be the largest postwar rebuilding since the Marshall Plan in Europe after World War II. 
 That comparison is being made at every opportunity by Bush administration officials, who emphasize American generosity and farsightedness. But the government's decision to invite only American corporations to bid on these contracts has added to the profound international divisions that already surround the war. 
The United States plans to retain control over the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq, allowing the administration to decide how it will spend the money needed to repair the country. These contracts will be financed by the taxpayer, although senior administration officials have hinted broadly that Iraqi oil revenue will also be used to rebuild the country.
"We're going to use the assets of the people of Iraq, especially their oil assets, to benefit their people," said Secretary of State Colin L. Powell on Friday.
At the top of the to-do list, according to confidential bidding documents, is rebuilding Iraq's only deep-water port, the harbor at Umm Qasr, where cargo is loaded on ships that travel down a waterway in southern Iraq to the Persian Gulf. Dredging work is expected to begin immediately after the port, which was seized by a British-led invasion force on Friday, is secure enough. The bid terms give contractors no more than eight weeks to prepare the port to handle the unloading of pallets and containers from large ships.
A separate bidding process is being conducted by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, a unit of the Defense Department. That agency is seeking bids and resumes from companies that are skilled in dismantling and neutralizing chemical and nuclear weapons.
Other immediate priorities will be overseen by the United States Agency for International Development. These include rebuilding two international and three domestic airports, ensuring that potable water is available and reconstructing electric power plants, roads, railroads, schools, hospitals and irrigation systems.
Bids sought by the Army Corps of Engineers call for more "expedient" repairs throughout the region that would be controlled by the United States Central Command. These repairs include installing temporary doors, using plywood to cover broken windows and covering damaged roof areas with plastic sheeting.
For now, the Bush administration is seeking money under a supplemental appropriation expected to be submitted to Congress shortly, according to administration officials.
BUT it may face some heat from lawmakers upset that the administration is moving so swiftly to sign deals with private companies without consulting Congress first.
The companies that have been invited to bid on the work include some of the nation's largest and most politically connected construction businesses. Among them are Halliburton, where Vice President Dick Cheney served as chief executive from 1995 until mid-2000; the Bechtel Group, whose ranks have included several Republican cabinet alumni; and Fluor, which has ties to several former top government intelligence and Pentagon procurement officials.
Others bidding on reconstruction business are the Parsons Corporation, the Louis Berger Group and the Washington Group International, which absorbed Morrison-Knudsen in 1996. 
Two other companies have submitted bids in the current round of contract awards, but contract officials declined to identify them. The final roster of seven bidders has already been narrowed to two or three, and contracts are expected to be awarded this week, according to administration officials.
While those contracts are sizable -- potentially worth more than $1 billion -- they are a pittance compared with the deals to follow, according to Andrew S. Natsios, the director of United States Agency for International Development, which is overseeing the largest contract put out for bids so far.
But Mr. Natsios disputed some of the outside estimates about the reconstruction costs. For example, a report jointly sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations predicts that it could take $25 billion simply to repair oil export installations and restore the Iraqi electric power system to its status before the first Persian Gulf war in 1991.
"The private contracting companies, all the consulting firms are going to tell us it's going to take $50 trillion to rebuild Iraq," Mr. Natsios said. "We'll make Iraq look like Park Avenue based on this amount of money. These are absurd estimates."
THE administration, clearly wary of a long occupation, says it hopes that a new Iraqi interim authority can be in place within a month of victory and that the authority's officials can make some decisions about the pace and financing of reconstruction. 
But the administration is already poised to decide which companies will initially oversee and carry out the work. They have extensive experience -- and some also have awkward political and financial baggage.
No company has firmer political connections than Kellogg Brown & Root, the engineering and construction arm of Halliburton. Besides its links to Mr. Cheney, the company has been a major military contractor since World War II. Most recently, it handled the high-speed construction of the Guantanamo prison compound for terror suspects . 
But since last May, the company has also come under scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating how the company has accounted for cost overruns on its construction and engineering work since 1998. And this spring, its shareholders will vote on a proposal, sponsored by two giant New York City pension funds, calling for a review of Halliburton's previous business ties to Iran.
Louis Berger, based in East Orange, N.J., could be a dark-horse contender in the Iraq reconstruction sweepstakes. Besides its work on an ambitious pipeline to carry oil from Tengiz, Kazakhstan, to a deep-water port on the Black Sea in Russia, the privately held firm has been an important government contractor in the Balkans for years. More recently, it won a contract to oversee extensive infrastructure development in postwar Afghanistan. The centerpiece of the $300 million contract was the rebuilding of a shattered 600-mile highway from Kabul to Herat.
Derish Wolff, the president and chief executive, declined to comment on the current reconstruction bidding process. But he noted that the company had been doing extensive "nation building" work in the Balkans.
"There is a difference between reconstruction and nation building, where you build institutions, and not just infrastructure," Mr. Wolff said. "You have to build, and you have to teach them to build."
BECHTEL is considered the largest contractor in the country, and one of the largest in the world. Its board includes a former secretary of state, George P. Shultz, and its ranks once included a former defense secretary, Caspar W. Weinberger. 
Bechtel, privately held and based in San Francisco, helped build the Hoover Dam, oversaw work on the tunnel under the English Channel and worked on the cleanup of Chernobyl. But it is facing a political meltdown of its own in Massachusetts, where it is under severe criticism by the state's inspector general for more than $1 billion in cost overruns on the tunnel and highway construction project in Boston, the so-called big dig.
Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts has ordered an independent review of the project, which was managed for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority by Bechtel and its joint venture partner, Parsons Brinckerhoff -- which is not related to the Parsons Corporation that is bidding on the Iraqi work. 
Jonathan Marshall, a spokesman for Bechtel, said the inspector general's recent report on the project "misrepresents the facts" and predicted that the company would be vindicated by the independent review.
The joint venture "has saved taxpayers more than $1 billion and cut years off the completion time," Mr. Marshall said. "We continue to stand by our record." Mr. Marshall would not comment on the recent bidding for Iraq reconstruction work.
Fluor, based in Aliso Viejo, Calif., is not currently working on any Agency for International Development projects, but it has extensive experience building petroleum facilities in difficult places. It is building an enormous plant on Sakhalin Island, off Russia's Pacific coast, for an international consortium that includes Exxon Mobil, and is developing oil and gas fields in Kazakhstan for a consortium whose largest member is ChevronTexaco.
Last April, Fluor hired Kenneth J. Oscar, who as acting assistant secretary of the Army oversaw the Pentagon's $35 billion-a-year procurement budget. Its board includes Bobby R. Inman, a retired admiral who was also former director of the National Security Agency and deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency.
Fluor is currently in arbitration to untangle a dispute with Anaconda Nickel in Australia over Fluor's work on a $615 million nickel-cobalt processing plant in western Australia. Fluor has disputed the accusations of poor workmanship, but Anaconda has collected millions of dollars in compensation in the first phase of the arbitration.
A spokesman for Fluor, Jerry Holloway, confirmed that it had been invited to bid on the work in Iraq but said he could not comment on the scale or scope of the contracts.
PARSONS, an employee-owned company based in Pasadena, Calif., is one of Bechel's most formidable rivals in the construction market. 
Parsons, too, would not comment on the current procurement process. But it has done extensive postwar reconstruction work in Bosnia and Kosovo and built the Saudi military city of Yanbu. It also helped build the subway system in metropolitan Washington. It does not have the prominent political connections that Bechtel and Fluor have, though the labor secretary , Elaine Chao, served on its board for about a year before joining the cabinet in January 2001.
In 1998, Parsons won a contract to take over the vehicle inspection program in New Jersey, a deal that has mired the company in a long dispute over delays and malfunctions. But last year, the state renewed the company's contract for another two years, though it cut the company's pay rate and established penalties for poor service.
After the Washington Group International, based in Bosie, Idaho, took over the ailing but venerable Morrison-Knudsen, it continued to acquire engineering operations from Westinghouse and Raytheon. The Raytheon purchases became a financial quagmire, and Washington filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2001. Last year, it emerged after an extensive restructuring.
It remains a major military contractor, however, and has done extensive work in the department's so-called demilitarization work, which involves the dismantling and safe disposal of old weapons. It dominates the business of neutralizing and disposing of chemical weapons within the United States, according to Jack Herrmann, a spokesman.
CONFIDENTIAL contract documents indicate that companies will be paid under an arrangement known as "cost plus fixed fee." Once the cost of a project is established, the contractor is entitled to recover those costs plus a fee that is a fixed percentage of those costs. That percentage is generally 8 to 10 percent, although the security precautions required under the Iraq contracts might justify a higher fee in some cases, construction industry analysts said.
The fast-track reconstruction bidding is already drawing fire in Congress. "We can't tell the taxpayers in this country, who are going to be asked to foot the bill for all of this, what the charge is going to be in the aftermath," Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, complained recently. "Apparently, I think the administration believes that they can get away with it, that the Congress will not do anything about it."
Administration officials said they moved swiftly because they needed to line up contractors with proven track records and high-level security clearances.
"The prime contractors are American, and there's a reason for that: In order to work in Iraq you have to have a security clearance, and the only companies that have security clearances are a certain number of American companies that have done this work before in war settings," Mr. Natsios said.
More than 50 percent of the money will actually be spent by subcontractors. Companies in any country, save those on the administration's terror list, can apply to be subcontractors, he added.
He also dismissed the lawmakers' criticism as uninformed. "I think some senators and congressmen, because they're under severe stress, have not maybe gone into the details of this, but their staffs have been briefed," Mr. Natsios said. 
But those arrangements do not satisfy construction industry experts, who say that the administration is asking for trouble by not setting up an independent monitoring process from the beginning. 
Thomas D. Thacher II runs a consulting firm that monitored the integrity of the cleanup process at ground zero in Manhattan for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and New York City. He questioned the wisdom of demanding such speed without also establishing ways to monitor the integrity of the rebuilding process.
"Anytime you have an emergency response driven by time, the opportunity for fraud, waste and abuse is huge," Mr. Thacher said. "And when the opportunity is that great, it will occur."

To the Editor:
 Re "Drilling in Alaska, a Priority for Bush, Fails in the Senate" (news article, March 20): The arguments for drilling in the Alaskan wilderness -- that it would create employment and help the economy -- are valid, but include a major flaw: the jobs will last only as long as the oil does. 
 Why not instead develop environmentally friendly, renewable sources of energy that could potentially provide as many jobs, if not more? By protecting the caribou today, we are preventing the future devastation caused by a degraded environment.

HEADLINE: Learning The Economics Of This War 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
WAR is not always good for the economy, but it seemed that way last week.
 As United States and British troops swept into Iraq, oil prices plunged and stocks soared. The Dow Jones industrial average gained more than 660 points, or 8.4 percent -- its best week in 20 years. 
 The rally proves a favorite Wall Street maxim: the market hates uncertainty. For months, investors worried about what might happen after war began. Would protests shake Arab and Muslim countries friendly to the United States? Would Al Qaeda attack American soil? Would Iraq destroy its oil wells?
"There was a lot of uncertainty up to this week -- concerns about the war, worst-case-scenario situations," said Gary Thayer, the chief economist at A. G. Edwards, a brokerage firm, on Friday. 
In fact, in Wall Street's judgment through Friday, the war was going well, with few Iraqi oil wells destroyed. As a result, the price of a barrel of oil fell 24 percent for the week, closing at $26.91, down $8.47, the biggest weekly drop since the first gulf war.
Lower oil prices will free cash for consumers to spend and businesses to invest, Mr. Thayer said.
Richard J. DeKaser, chief economist at the National City Bank in Cleveland, said the American economy began to sputter in August, when the White House first signaled it planned to confront Iraq. Businesses cut back on capital investment and laid off workers. Now, he said, they will probably start hiring.
But Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of the Yale School of Management, warned that investors were ignoring the uncertainties of what will happen over the next few months. The world economy was weak before Washington confronted Iraq, he said.
At the same time, Mr. Garten argued, a successful war might worsen the deficit by increasing the odds that Congress will pass President Bush's $726 billion plan to cut taxes. On Friday, the House passed a budget plan with the cut, while the Senate rejected efforts to shrink it to $350 billion.
Mr. Garten said that the tax cuts might be approved before the White House has outlined how much it plans to spend on the war and rebuilding Iraq. "There are too many uncertainties ahead, and too many risks on the downside," he said, "to be even the slightest bit complacent." ALEX BERENSON

Tourism Industry Braces for the Impact of War

BYLINE:  By KATHLEEN O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
Just as the tourism industry was recov-ering in the United States, the war in Iraq threatened to push it back into a recession.
 Tourism revenue had not returned to the levels reached before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but it had been rising. 
In the fourth quarter of 2002, it totaled $380 billion, versus $355 billion in the period a year earlier, the Bureau of Economic Analysis said. 
 The Travel Industry Association of America has already announced that the weak economy and the war have stalled the recovery. The war could lead to higher fuel prices and more terrorist acts, further discouraging travel. Even if fuel prices stabilize and the war ends quickly, the industry may have to discount rates aggressively to lure back customers.

PERSON: Thomas P. Ryan Jr. 

HEADLINE: T. P. Ryan Jr., 74, Ex-Mayor of Rochester 

 BODY:
Thomas P. Ryan Jr., the mayor of Rochester during two decades of fiscal challenges and urban redevelopment, died on March 14 in Rochester. He was 74.
 The cause was pancreatic cancer, friends of the family said. His death came the day before the city's annual St. Patrick's Day parade, which he established 26 years ago. Marchers dedicated this year's parade to him. 
 As mayor from 1974 to 1994, Mr. Ryan raised professionalism in City Hall by discouraging patronage and the solicitation of campaign contributions from contractors. He tried to stem population decline by rebuilding the downtown commercial district and city neighborhoods.
Mr. Ryan was the city's first "strong mayor" since the 1920's. In 1984, voters approved a measure to end the city's council-manager government, in which the city manager was the chief administrative officer and the City Council chose the mayor. After years as the appointed mayor, Mr. Ryan, who favored the change, was directly elected to the post the following year.
He was known for his ability to collaborate with political opponents. When a series of taxpayer lawsuits in the 1970's determined that Rochester and other upstate cities had exceeded constitutional tax limits, Mr. Ryan, a Democrat, worked with Republican leaders to save the city from bankruptcy. He reached an agreement with the Monroe County executive, Lucien A. Morin, a Republican, to increase the city's share of local sales tax revenues.
While Mr. Ryan once described the mayoralty as "the only job I will ever want," he was uncomfortable in the limelight.
"It was the business of the city that consumed him, not the ribbon cuttings," said Betsy Relin, a former county elections commissioner.
Mr. Ryan grew up in Rochester, working at his father's market in the Park Avenue neighborhood. He served in the Marine Corps and graduated from St. Bonaventure University and Syracuse Law School. His political career began in 1961, when he was elected county supervisor. He was appointed mayor after being elected to the Rochester City Council in 1973, and later won two elections to the post.
Under Mr. Ryan's leadership, the city built a convention center, revitalized its Genesee riverfront, including the High Falls area, renovated a former federal building as the new City Hall and helped develop Frontier Field, a baseball park near the headquarters of the Eastman Kodak Company.
Yet one development became a longstanding embarrassment. Construction of a 25-story hotel halted when the private developer ran out of money. The unfinished building on the city's main street stood empty for three years until Mr. Ryan and other government and corporate leaders assembled financing.
When the hotel finally opened in 1992, Mr. Ryan engaged in an uncharacteristic display of public theatrics by throwing political cartoons about the project into the trash.
Mr. Ryan decided not to seek re-election in 1993. He was succeeded by William A. Johnson Jr., a Democrat and the first African-American to hold the position. Although Mr. Ryan declined to endorse a candidate in the race, he announced his intention to vote for Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Ryan's survivors include his wife, Charlotte; a daughter, Mary; a brother, Joseph; and a sister, Mary Griffin.

HEADLINE: Trying Again to Make Gun Makers Liable for Shootings 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM GLABERSON 

 BODY:
Jury selection is to begin tomorrow in Brooklynfederal court in a lawsuit that gun control advocates say could bring a landmark ruling against the firearms industry. Firearms makers, however, call the suit a defamatory attack by radical anti-gun forces.
 The suit, filed by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, has drawn national attention because the N.A.A.C.P. has gained access to previously sealed government data tracing sales of guns that may have been used in crimes. 
 The group is also expected to call a former firearms industry lobbyist who would be the first important whistleblower against the gun industry. 
The N.A.A.C.P contends in the suit, filed in 1999, that its members have been disproportionately injured by gun makers and dealers, and claims that their distribution policies permit guns to be channeled to criminals. More than 80 manufacturers and distributors, including all the major companies, are defendants.
"It's going to be the first time the manufacturers are going to have to face the full array of the proof against them," said David Kairys, a professor at Temple University Law School in Philadelphia who is an adviser to many municipalities in other gun cases around the country.
The lawsuit, like more than 30 others around the country, claims that the practices of the gun industry amount to a "public nuisance" because they permit guns to fall into the hands of criminals.
Instead of seeking damages for the families of gun victims, the association seeks an injunction that would establish new restrictions on the marketing and distribution of handguns.
The bitterness of the legal battle has intensified as the case has moved toward trial. An industry group, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, recently released a statement attacking the chief lawyer for the N.A.A.C.P., Elisa Barnes, as a "radical anti-gun lawyer," and the federal judge in the case, Jack B. Weinstein, as an "activist, anti-gun jurist."
Last week, Ms. Barnes said such attacks showed that the industry had no response to her client's claims that manufacturers and distributors have long known how guns reached criminals but permitted illegal sales to continue. "They have hidden," she said, "behind a 'see no evil hear no evil' veil for the last 20 years, and we finally have the evidence that they have seen and they have heard."
Industry lawyers say that the gunmakers and distributors are already tightly regulated and cannot be held responsible for the criminal acts of people who obtain their products. They say it is outrageous for the association to assert that the policies of the gun makers contribute to murder.
"This industry has acted responsibly," said John. F. Renzulli, a lawyer for Glock Inc. and more than a dozen other companies. "There is not even an allegation that any manufacturer or distributor in this case has broken the law or created any crime in New York City."
Many industry lawyers last met Ms. Barnes in a 1999 case in the same court, United States District Court in Brooklyn. That case ended with the first jury verdict to find gun makers liable for shootings because their marketing practices led to illegal trafficking in guns. The verdict was overturned on appeal.
Ms. Barnes said the current case is largely an effort to fill legal gaps that the appeals court found in the 1999 case. She said she would amplify her presentation in the earlier case partly with the testimony of Robert A. Ricker, a former lobbyist with the American Shooting Sports Council who joined forces with plaintiffs' lawyers in February.
In a court filing, Mr. Ricker said gun manufacturers had long known that some of their dealers sold guns to criminals but pressured one another into remaining silent for fear of legal liability. The Brooklyn case is expected to be Mr. Ricker's first appearance on the witness stand for the plaintiffs in a liability case, and industry lawyers are already attacking his credibility.
Both sides say the heart of the N.A.A.C.P.'s case will be a statistical analysis of data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that includes the sales history of guns that law-enforcement agencies seek to trace. Many of those tracing requests are begun after guns are found in crime investigations. Critics of the gun industry have long sought the information to try to show that manufacturers knew how their guns were routed toward illegal uses.
Ms. Barnes obtained the data from the government and is expected to argue that it shows a clear path from some manufacturers to certain distributors and then to murders in New York. Industry lawyers say the information was never intended to be used to draw any statistical conclusions about the industry and that Ms. Barnes manipulates the numbers to draw her own conclusions.
One expert who is to testify for the N.A.A.C.P., Lucy P. Allen, an economist, said in a court filing that the government data suggested that some gunmakers know how to sharply reduce the number of guns that reach criminals.
She said almost no guns from some gunmakers end up in crimes, while for other gunmakers the percentage over a five-year period was as high as 65 percent.

HEADLINE: North Korea Delays Inter-Korean Talks, Citing Military Tensions 

BYLINE:  Reuters

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, March 22 

 BODY:
North Korea said today that it was postponing talks with South Korea, criticizing the the South Korean government for beefing up its defenses after the start of the United States-led campaign against Iraq.
 In Beijing, a United Nations envoy said North Korea, which Washington says is developing nuclear weapons, was concerned that it would be the United States' next target after Iraq. President Bush has referred to North Korea, Iraq and Iran as an "axis of evil." 
 North Korea was scheduled to hold talks with Seoul starting on Wednesday to discuss economic exchanges.
The North Korean government was "compelled to postpone meetings and contact between the North and the South," North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency quoted the chairman of the North-South Committee for Promotion of Economic Cooperation as saying in a statement. "The South side is to blame for this."
The news agency added that "the South Korean authorities declared a dangerous 'high alert posture' against the North under the pretext of the Iraqi war," referring to South Korean media reports that said Seoul had raised its military alert status.
The South Korean government denied those reports.
The statement also referred to current joint American and South Korea military exercises as "driving the situation in Korea to the brink of war." 
South Korea has been on guard for any steps by North Korea to ratchet up tension in its standoff with Washington over its suspected nuclear weapons program, after recent North Korean missile tests and the interception of a American spy plane. 
The United Nations envoy, Maurice Strong, told reporters in Beijing that he had met "very senior officials" this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
Asked if North Korea feared it would be the next target, now that American-led forces had invaded Iraq, he said: "Fear I do not believe is in their vocabulary. Concern, yes. There is a real desire to seek peaceful settlement, but they are preparing for war, if necessary."
Mr. Strong, a Canadian aide to United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, gave no details about those preparations.
The United States, focused on the war with Iraq, has played down a series of recent North Korean moves, including two antiship missile test-firings in the past couple of weeks and steps toward restarting its suspected nuclear weapons program.
Some defense analysts say that North Korea may take advantage of Washington's focus on the Iraq war to test a longer-range missile or start processing spent nuclear fuel to make weapons in an effort to force Washington into direct talks.
North Korea said on Friday that the Iraq war would have "disastrous" consequences and warned South Korea that it was playing with fire if it tried to mobilize its defenses.
North Korea accused the United States of inciting the second nuclear crisis in a decade on the divided Korean Peninsula, saying the situation was moving close to an "explosive phase."

U.S. and Mexico Coordinate Military Efforts for Mutual Protection Against Terror

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico, March 21 

 BODY:
The United States and Mexico, after battling over their common border for so many years, are now coordinating military missions to protect it from attack.
 Mexico is sending thousands of soldiers to patrol the border and help secure it against terrorist threats -- an unprecedented move. The Mexicans have never used their army to help defend their neighbor. 
 "It's a new mission: Mexico looking out for the United States," said Sgt. Benito Hernandez, a Mexican soldier on sentry duty here in Juarez, where thousands of travelers and truckers cross the border in both directions every day. 
Mexico is sending 18,000 soldiers to secure airports, seaports, border posts and bridges with direct links to the United States. At least half will be based within a few miles of the border, many serving as sentries in the desert. Others will serve in the interior, guarding tourist resorts and oil refineries, the two great sources of foreign revenue for Mexico.
The United States, for its part, has Special Forces, Army Rangers and Marines to monitor thousands of square miles at the Mexican border with night patrols, electronic sensors, pilotless drone aircraft first used 18 months ago in Afghanistan and helicopters with infrared scopes.
They are training their sights away from smugglers of drugs and migrants toward the terrorist threat, erasing the "thin line between counterdrug and counterterror missions" to quote Gen. John Yingling, one of their commanders. The American military is moving closer to using its soldiers as law enforcers, as Mexico has done for years.
Soldiers attached to General Yingling's Joint Task Force Six, based just north of Juarez at Fort Bliss, Tex., have orders to support United States drug enforcement. They "could also be effectively employed inthe combating terrorism effort," said their spokesman, Armando Carrasco. "Terrorism and drug trafficking are intertwined and use many of the same operational methods."
They are under the new Northern Command headquarters in Colorado, which has been given responsibility for overseeing the United States, Mexico and Canada. The Northern Command includes officers of the C.I.A. and the F.B.I., which in turn are sharing border security information with their Mexican counterparts. The Federal Protective Police, Mexico's equivalent of the F.B.I., is heavily involved in the new security mobilization, as is Cisen, Mexico's equivalent of the C.I.A.
These linkages and the coast-to-coast mobilization by both nations represents the birth of a international national-security network, American and Mexican officials said.
"Mexico is not going to be used as a transit point for any terrorist or anyone who wishes to harm the United States," said Interior Minister Santiago Creel, who oversees Cisen. Mexico said hours after combat began in Iraq that it would deny visas to travelers from a list of Arabic and Asian countries deemed hostile to the war effort.
By collaborating against a foreign threat, both nations are crossing a line that they had never breached.
"Despite the inherent distrust between both countries' law enforcement and their militaries, they had to find a way to talk to each other and share information," said Ana Maria Salazar, a former Pentagon official and an expert in Mexican national security doctrine. "They were forced to figure out a way to coordinate."
Mexico is striving to show political and military support for the United States after rejecting President Bush's demand for its vote at the United Nations Security Council for a war against Iraq.
Mexican officials are worried that the United States will extract a price for that rejection by closing off the border, which would severely damage Mexico's economy, or expel thousands of undocumented Mexican migrants in the United States.
"You have to give the Americans a sense of security," Ms. Salazar said, "or they will close down the border the moment they get an inkling of some threat."
Mr. Creel said Mexico felt "compelled to collaborate with the United States to identify any potential risk" at the border "both against American citizens or assets or here in our own country."
Here in Juarez, where four busy border crossings remain open, travelers and truckers are being subjected to a higher level of scrutiny on the American side of the border under the newly re-established Code Orange alert. The level of cross-border trade between Mexico and the United States -- more than $250 billion a year -- has not changed.
What has changed is the greater intensity of the flow of information between the American and Mexican military and intelligence services, officials said.
"It is impossible, really, to oversee the border, unless they put the entire United States Army there," said Rafael Fernandez de Castro, a foreign policy analyst in Mexico City.
"But the mobilization of 18,000 Mexican soldiers is a very big deal," he said. "And the strategic coordination between the Americans and the Mexicans has never been greater."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE INTERNET; 
Visits to Web Sites Surge as War Begins, and Most Are Up to Task

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
In the first few days of the military assault on Iraq, Internet traffic soared as users turned to news media Web sites for information on the war. While most news sites handled the spikes in activity well, there were slowdowns and blackouts at some sites, including the publicly accessible United States military sites. 
 ComScore Media Metrix, which measures Web traffic patterns, reported that on Thursday, the most recent day for which complete figures were available, worldwide traffic to major news media sites was up 70 percent over an average day during the previous four weeks. On Thursday, for instance, average daily traffic worldwide increased 200 percent for CNN.com, 218 percent for Foxnews.com and 207 percent for CBSnews.com, ComScore Media Metrix said. 
 Several military sites, however, had trouble dealing with the increased traffic, said Keynote Systems, a company that tracks how long it takes Web users to access various Internet sites. It found that Army and Marine sites experienced slow download times, and that the Air Force and Navy sites were inaccessible for several hours on Wednesday night but have recovered.
For its part, the Army issued a statement blaming stresses to the network infrastructure, not its own internal technology. 
"The Internet's doing well, and the web is doing well, but some sites being heavily hit that haven't been through this before are showing signs of performance degradation," said Eric Siegel, principal Internet consultant for Keynote. 
On Thursday, Akamai Technologies, which operates a network of Internet servers that distributes traffic to major Web sites, including Yahoo.com, MSNBC.com and ABCnews.com, said Internet traffic to the sites it served was the highest the company has measured. Traffic to roughly 1,000 sites hit an all-time high of 469,000 hits per second, an increase from a high of 290,000 hits per second earlier in the week.
Paul Sagan, the president of Akamai, said the figures did not necessarily indicate a huge increase in the number of unique visitors. Rather, he said, the data appears to show that people are repeatedly accessing the same sites.
According to Nielsen/NetRatings, a company that measures the number of visitors to individual Web sites, five million people in the United States had visited CNN.com from their workplaces on Thursday. That was an increase of 69 percent over the previous Thursday. MSNBC.com, the second-most heavily visited news site, had 3.9 million visitors, an increase of 65 percent over the same day a week earlier. 
Other news sites that saw week-over-week increases on Thursday were Washingtonpost.com (29 percent increase), Foxnews.com (77 percent) and USAToday.com (17 percent). 
Most news media sites have tried to beef up their news content to meet viewer demands. As soon as the first bombs were dropped on Baghdad, many media sites offered modified home pages intended to focus on the war and, in some cases, play down other news. 
The Web site of The New York Times, nytimes.com, slightly redesigned its home page to emphasize war coverage. But Leonard M. Apcar, editor in chief of the Times site, said the home page would continue to include other news. Mr. Apcar said nytimes.com had also stationed an Internet news producer in the Middle East who is responsible for coordinating multimedia packages for the Web site.
MSNBC.com has focused its entire home page on news about the war. It shifted resources from its sports and business staffs to its news desk. The company also has an Internet news reporter stationed in Northern Iraq, said Dean Wright, editor in chief of MSNBC.com.
The Fox Web site, foxnews.com, added links on its home page to the latest stories on the war and has increased its staff to publish more information more quickly. The site also significantly reduced the prominence of news unrelated to the war. 
"We don't need a feature on the Oscars that no one will read anyway," said Refet Kaplan, executive editor of Foxnews.com. "We believe in times of crisis, people are looking for information on one story."

HEADLINE: Congressional Memo; 
On the Hill, Budget Business as Usual

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE and DAVID FIRESTONE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 22 

 BODY:
The dull percussion of the war in Iraq came directly to the chambers of Congress late in the week, as members stood transfixed before the televisions in the cloakrooms of the House and Senate. But lawmakers could not linger long before the images of combat, with each house engaged deep into the night in skirmishes over next year's budget.
 Though Democrats pleaded for a halt after the war began, the Republican leaders of the House and Senate chose not to stop their march toward tax cuts and record deficits, pausing only to pass resolutions in support of the troops and the president. 
 In doing so, they were executing a plan agreed upon weeks ago to keep pressing their legislative program even if the bombs began to fall. The strategists who run the House and Senate said they had learned the political lesson of the 1991 gulf war, when the first Bush administration failed to switch quickly to a domestic agenda after the cease-fire, wounding the president and his party. Top members of this current crop of Republicans said they did not intend to make the same mistake. 
"We will be aggressively pursuing our business in Congress while the president is conducting the war on terror," said Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, the House majority leader.
But the course chosen by Mr. DeLay and his colleagues may bear its own price. With President Bush and the muscle of the administration focused predominantly overseas, Congressional Republicans have found themselves pushing a bold set of initiatives without the ready assistance of the lobbyist in chief. And the strains are beginning to show, as several items that had been priorities for the administration have been deferred or defeated.
The administration backed off a plan to require Medicare recipients to join a health maintenance organization to get a prescription drug benefit, and has made little effort on its proposals to change the Social Security system. After telling Congress this year that it would not support additional requests for domestic security spending, the administration dropped its fight last week and agreed to include billions more in the supplemental appropriations request.
On Wednesday, the White House lost a hard-fought battle with Democrats and environmental groups to drill for oil in the Alaskan wildlife refuge, suffering a narrow defeat in the Senate. On Friday, it could not prevent three Republicans from joining with Democrats to cut $100 billion from its proposed tax cuts to pay for the war. And while the administration won most of the skirmishes over its budget, preserving most of the $726 billion tax cut, many of the votes on the tax cut were surprisingly close, forcing Republican leaders in both houses to scramble for a winning margin.
White House veterans say wartime requires a concentration that can take its toll on legislative matters. "When you are at war, you become a war White House," said Representative Rahm Emanuel, a freshman Democrat from Illinois who was a senior aide in the Clinton White House. "Everything else gets downgraded."
Republicans are not as blunt, but they acknowledge that keeping up the domestic momentum is now essentially their job, not that of the White House.
"The administration's job is certainly more onerous right now," said Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico. "It may be harder for them to get everything through the sieve. But here, it's not so difficult for us to do all those things at once. We've got our committee structure, and we'll do whatever it takes to make sure the domestic agenda doesn't get short shrift."
Republican lawmakers say the administration's need to focus on the war sometimes requires them to pick up the slack and fight harder, though many say the party's domestic agenda of tax and spending cuts would have been a tough sell even with the president's hands-on assistance. Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the House Republican whip, said that in this budget debate, in contrast to past ones, the president did not make a single call to lobby wavering members. 
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee, said he would push ahead on the tax bill on his own if he had to, saying the White House was not always in the right position to broker the compromises necessary to win a tax cut in a narrowly divided Senate.
"There are some things the president simply can't do right now," he said. "Of course, the secretary of the Treasury, or of commerce, can help us move things along, but that's not always as effective as the president himself. But that isn't going to stop us."
The burst of energy by Congressional Republicans also has its strategic value. Democrats complained that Republicans were intent on getting the budget passed quickly so they could preserve the president's tax cut before the request for tens of billions of dollars to pay for the war and its aftermath in Iraq.
"It appears to me that maybe there is a rush to go through the budget because maybe people are going to start asking questions about how much this war is costing," said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, as he addressed his colleagues.
Other Democrats say it is to the advantage of the Republicans to keep moving some of their more contentious proposals on the environment, the economy and health care while much of the public's attention is focused elsewhere. The critics do not argue that the measures are being passed in the dark of night, but say they will not get the scrutiny they should.
"No one is paying near the attention they would normally," said a senior Senate Democratic aide.
Republicans dispute that notion. "The truth is that in time of war, beyond oversight and some extraordinary legislation, there is not a whole lot for members of Congress to do," Mr. Blunt said. "Certainly nothing that is going to have a longer impact than getting our normal work done."
Republicans are also discovering that the conflict can provide a new tool of persuasion. As they tried to line up support for a budget resolution that many Republicans had serious reservations about, House leaders pounded home the idea that it was not the time to embarrass the president by defeating his budget plan. The resolution squeaked through. Simultaneously, Republican senators worked to make the argument that wartime was a poor moment for a floor fight on taxes.
"When our troops are over there fighting, we don't want partisan bickering to be what they see on television from back home," said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. "We want them to see our support, our total commitment, because if the economy sags, it's going to affect everyone over there fighting now."

HEADLINE: To Understand Life, Just Do the Math 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTINE DiGRAZIA 

 BODY:
WHEN Anne H. Milley cruises the produce section of her local Stop & Shop, she doesn't just notice that the store is selling a larger selection of organic and health food items these days. She wonders how the supermarket chain quantified its decision to do so.
 When she sees the sidewalk outside the store, she doesn't just see cement. She sees the algorithms used to determine its proper consistency. 
 And when she eats the store's broccoli, she doesn't just enjoy it; she also thinks about how regression analysis probably helped the farmers maximize their crop. 
Such is the everyday universe through Mrs. Milley's eyes. She is what is known in analytics circles as a "quant," short for quantitative analysis -- a person who thinks of everything in terms of data.
While most college basketball fans were trying to guess which men's basketball teams would be picked for this month's National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament, she and two mathematics professors predicted the teams with a 94 percent accuracy rate.
Based on analytical software she developed at SAS Institute, a data analysis software company in Cary, N.C., Mrs. Milley and the professors have picked the 64 teams for the tournament in the last three years with a more than 90 percent degree of accuracy.
Mrs. Milley, manager of analytical strategy at SAS, spends her days finding patterns in events or decisions that appear random, arbitrary or just plain ridiculous to the average person. Some of her projects have included analyzing the spread of tuberculosis in Queens, N.Y., and locating oil fields in the North Sea.
"I've long had an appreciation of analytical capabilities," Mrs. Milley, 38, said from her home office in Ivoryton. "Everybody has different perspectives in life. I majored in math, so it gave me a good cross section of understanding. The biggest thing I noticed is the role that probability plays in everything from our investments to understanding relationships. Everything is influenced by something else."
Growing up in Florida in the late 1960's and 1970's, Mrs. Milley said that she and her sister, Laurie, had an inkling things were a little different at their home than at other girls' homes.
"My father was a chemistry professor at a junior college in Florida, so he always stressed math with us," Mrs. Milley said. "I remember being quite young and driving in our car on a very bright day. I asked my father why trees are green. He said there was a process called photosynthesis and a substance called chlorophyll that interacts with sunlight to make plants green."
Mrs. Milley said math came so easily to her father and sister, a former physics major who is now a civil defense engineer, that she would become frustrated when they knew the answers before she did.
"I had a love-hate relationship with math," said Mrs. Milley, who holds bachelor's and master's degrees in economics from Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton. "I was always challenging myself in college math courses to do better."
Mrs. Milley is such an expert in her field that she is one of several visionaries being featured in a new book about business intelligence by Jim Goodnight, the chief executive of SAS.
"With her strong technical background and business experience, Anne, like SAS, is a bridge between quantitative experts and business users who both want more from their data and answers to critical business questions," Mr. Goodnight said. 
Mrs. Milley, he added, is raising awareness "about the power of analysis."
Mike Barlow, a business writer in Fairfield who covers analytic technologies, said of Mrs. Milley: "Anne is a happy combination of John Nash in 'A Beautiful Mind' and Cayce Pollard, the heroine of William Gibson's newest cyberpunk novel, 'Pattern Recognition."' 
In fact, she may be considered somewhat of a sex symbol in the higher order of analytics geeks. 
"After talking with Anne, you doubt everything you've ever read or been taught," Mr. Barlow said. "With Anne, there is no middle ground. You can view the universe through the lens of statistics or through the gauze of superstition.
"Here's the difference between Anne's approach to the N.C.A.A. and everyone else's: they guess, she's analyzes. So when they're right, it's just luck. When she's right, it's science. Over time, she'll be right more than the talking heads on ESPN."
To predict N.C.A.A. picks, Allen Lynch and Jay Coleman, an economics and quantitative methods expert, and a management, marketing and logistics expert, respectively, used Mrs. Milley's software to develop what they call the Dance Card program.
"We wanted to apply the analytical program to something even the most non-math person could get excited about," Mr. Lynch said. "The greatest challenge as an educator is having the ability to break down ideas that may be abstract and theoretical into something palatable so that students can understand it."
Here is how it works: every year, the N.C.A.A. selection committee bases its annual selections on a variety of factors. But the two professors sensed there was a hidden pattern at play. Their formula suggests that only six pieces of information about each team are significant in determining whether a team gets an at-large tournament bid.
They analyzed team data from 1994 through 1999 and wrote an equation that accurately predicted up to 97 percent of the at-large selections during that time frame. Then they applied the same equation to the future, correctly predicting teams in the 2001 and 2002 tournaments. The results of their analysis and the information on how to acquire the actual equation are available on www.unf.edu/ 3/5tilde 4/5jcoleman/dance.htm. The nice thing about this model, Mr. Lynch said, " is that, once developed, it is purely objective. Therefore, results can be easily replicated and claims regarding accuracy can be easily verified."
An unexpected benefit of the professors' computer-generated predictions, Mr. Lynch said, is that the N.C.A.A. tournament committee "has demonstrated remarkable consistency in selection criteria."
Mr. Coleman said: "We get teased quite a bit about when are we going to go to Vegas, but we've never used it to bet on who gets in, or who wins games once the field is set. We basically just do this for our own enjoyment as sports fans, and as a means to bring together our leisure pursuits and our work pursuits. 
"Also, keep in mind that the model is designed to predict who gets into the tournament, and not necessarily what's going to happen once the tournament starts."
Mrs. Milley, who enjoys hockey more than basketball, said that when she heard about the Dance Card, she wanted to know more about how the professors used the SAS software.
The three are now working together to enhance the SAS software. The change will benefit those in the academic and business worlds as well, Mr. Coleman said.
Mrs. Milley's passion for statistics makes her an automatic expert on just about any subject that deals with numbers. Why do hamburger joints always open next to each other?
"It's more important that your business be at the place that gets a lot of traffic for the same item than it is to be the only business around," she said.
How can a couple be turned down for a loan when they both have jobs?
"The lending institution bases its decisions on a model that can predict who will default on a loan. If a couple has two jobs, but moves around a lot or has bad credit, they will most likely be turned down."
She is a quantifiable expert in money matters, especially the banking kind. For her thesis, she built an analytical model widely used today to predict whether a bank will fail.
"I wrote it during the 1980's savings and loan crisis," she said. "Regulators wanted to have a better early-warning system to predict which banks would fail. Other models existed, but my thesis helped refine them."
It was a document that would lead directly to an outcome Mrs. Milley may also have been able to predict. Mrs. Milley said that when she was a new intern at a bank in Dallas, she visited the company gym for the first time to meet people.
"I was alone there with one other person," she said. "He wouldn't make eye contact."
When another person came in and they began to talk, Mrs. Milley mentioned that she had done her thesis on bank failure predictive models and their relationship to yield curve inversion.
"Later, my husband, Frank, who is vice president at Webster Bank, told me that he overheard what I had said and wanted to get to know me," she said.

HEADLINE: Avian Flu Raises Concerns on Economy 

BYLINE:  By GAIL BRACCIDIFERRO 

 BODY:
THERE are so many people and businesses whose financial well-being is tied to the eastern Connecticut egg farm where an outbreak of influenza among chickens has been found, that First Selectman Keith Robbins of Bozrah said he didn't want to think about the potential economic devastation from even a temporary shutdown of the farm.
 From the Kofkoff Egg Farm's 300 employees and the trades people who perform contract work there, to the railroad that hauls feed and the gas dealer who supplies propane, Mr. Robbins said the farm was integral to the economy of rural towns throughout the region. 
 "The impact to the town and the state would be terrible," he said of a farm shutdown. 
Local and state officials said, however, they were confident that steps taken by Kofkoff and the State Department of Agriculture to contain the avian flu outbreak would be enough to avoid a shutdown. 
While officials said there was no risk of the disease being transmitted to humans or other mammals and the eggs remain safe to eat, two Kofkoff farms in Bozrah and Lebanon are under a quarantine order. The disease can lower egg production in the birds and in some cases can be fatal. A weak strain of the avian flu was detected in the two farms that house some 3 million chickens, said Bruce Gresczyk, acting commissioner of the agriculture department.
The state also is awaiting United States Department of Agriculture approval for a pilot vaccination program that will prevent Kofkoff from having to destroy chickens on the affected farms, he said. 
The typical method of containing an avian flu outbreak is to kill the birds, Mr. Gresczyk said. If Kofkoff was forced to do this, however, it could take as long as two years before it could resume operations at the affected farms, he said. 
While Kofkoff will pay to vaccinate its birds, the law would require the state to pay to kill the birds, Mr. Gresczyk said. He said he was uncertain what it would cost to vaccinate or kill the birds.
"We are trying to ensure the survivability of the farm," Mr. Gresczyk said. "There is a significant impact beyond the farm itself."
Kofkoff has nearly 5 million chickens in Franklin, Lebanon, Hebron, Colchester and Bozrah. The company produces about 2 million dozen eggs a week for markets in the United States and Puerto Rico, Mr. Gresczyk said. Kofkoff produces about 90 percent of the state's eggs.
Poultry is a $100 million business annually in Connecticut, Michael Darre, a professor and poultry extension specialist at the University of Connecticut, said. In Bozrah, the Kofkoff property is assessed at $5.5 million and the farm is among the town's top three taxpayers, Mr. Robbins said. 
In Lebanon, Kofkoff pays some $90,000 in property taxes annually and is both the second and fourth largest taxpayer because of how its business holdings are split.
"They are right up there as far as revenues to the town," First Selectman Daniel McGuire of Lebanon said. "I'm not going to tell you it's not a concern, because it is."
In Franklin, where Kofkoff owns a grain mill, the company also is among the town's top 10 taxpayers, First Selectman Richard Matters said.
Mr. Gresczyk said Kofkoff accounted for 40 percent of the freight on the New England Central Railroad between New London and Palmer, Mass.
James Rock, president of the Connecticut Poultry Association, said he had received a number of calls from poultry business people concerned about the avian flu outbreak. They are particularly worried about a quarantine spreading to other farms, which could prevent them from shipping birds raised for meat, he said. 
"It could be a big financial loss," he said.
After two weeks of testing that began in February at Kofkoff, positive flu test results were found on farms on Mack Road in Lebanon and on Schwartz Road in Bozrah. Three other facilities in Lebanon, Franklin and Bozrah tested negative for the disease, while test results have not been received for farms in Colchester and Hebron.
Mr. Gresczyk said it did not appear those facilities will test positive, however, because birds there showed no signs of having the flu. 
Testing began after Kofkoff officials noticed lowered egg production, as well as typical flu symptoms such as lack of appetite, runny beaks and lethargy in some birds, he said.
Within two weeks, the state hopes to receive federal approval to begin the vaccination program, Mr. Gresczyk said.
In the meantime, strict biosecurity measures are in place at all Kofkoff facilities. All employees and vehicles entering and exiting are being disinfected, personnel access is being limited and large red and white "No Trespassing" signs have been posted. 
Kofkoff management did not return repeated telephone calls for comment.
Local and state officials praised the company's efforts in responding to the outbreak. "Kofkoff deserves the congratulations," Mr. Gresczyk said.
Because the disease can be transmitted to other domesticated and wild birds, residents with backyard poultry flocks are being warned to take precautions. Mr. Darre at UConn's School of Agriculture and Natural Resources said anyone with poultry should be sure to clean their boots before and after tending their birds, have a set of clothing they wear only for tending the birds, and be cautious about who is allowed near their flocks.
"Especially if they have friends who have birds," he said. 
Mr. Darre said that because wild waterfowl pose a threat for spreading the disease, domestic flock owners should have a roof over their flocks and secure fences.
An outbreak of avian flu in 1983 temporarily halted all poultry exhibits at fairs.
"We did stop fairs for a year and a half," Mr. Darre said. "But that was a high pathogenic strain. We're on a wait and see basis here."
Mr. Darre said he was uncertain exactly how many backyard poultry flocks exist in eastern Connecticut, but said many rural residents raise a few birds for pets, showing, eggs, meat or 4-H projects.
Mr. Robbins said he thought there may be about 10 small poultry farmers in Bozrah. State officials will be testing these flocks for flu in coming weeks.
"I've had a couple of calls," he said. "I think their concerns were put to rest."

 BODY:
Posters From the U.N.
 One way that the United Nations gets its messages across is through the dissemination of posters, many of them created by world-famous artists including Robert Rauschenberg, Joan Miro, Keith Haring, Peter Max and others. In a current exhibition at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich are 30 posters from among hundreds produced since 1945 when the United Nations was formed. 
 Called "For A Better World," the traveling display had its first showing at United Nations Headquarters in New York in December of 2000 and has been around the world since. After its Greenwich engagement, through April 27, it will go to Prague. Initiatives embraced by the world organization and expressed in the posters include disarmament, peacekeeping, human rights, economic and social development, the environment, and the fight against poverty, hunger and illiteracy. 
A second exhibition at the Bruce through Oct. 19 contains a wealth of bird lore, imagery and symbolism represented in some 45 objects from various American Indian cultures. Each culture offers a view of the world of birds and their surrounding flora and fauna within the geographical range of the tribe. Because of their ability to leave the earth, speeding skyward and far away, birds were imbued by native peoples with supernatural powers, able to carry messages back and forth to the gods.
Clothing, ceremonial objects, crafts and tools were adorned with painted, woven, carved and fired images of birds. The thunderbird, for example, is depicted in beads on a pair of vintage moccasins. 
The Bruce is just off Exit 3 of Interstate 95, open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 to 5; Sunday 1 to 5. 
Admission is $5 for adults, $4 for students and adults over 64, free for children under 5 and free for everyone on Tuesdays.

Rabbit Hill Book Festival
 Rabbit Hill, the name of Robert Lawson's home on Weston Road in Westport, gave rise to the Rabbit Hill Book Festival, now in its third year, honoring Mr. Lawson, who so far is the only author-illustrator to have won both the Caldecott and Newbery Medals for excellence in children's illustration and literature.
This year's edition is to be held Thursday through Sunday, with Wendell Minor, the children's book illustrator, opening the proceedings at the Bernhard Main Library Thursday at 7:30. He will talk about his work for children and his book jackets for such best sellers as "All The President's Men" and "Prince of Tides." Lectures and book signings Saturday will take place in various schools featuring five authors and illustrators: Jean Craighead George, Susan Jeffers, Jerry Pinkney, Hope Ryden and Mr. Minor. For times and schools: (203)227-8411.
An adult symposium titled "Animals in Literature for Children: Fable, Fact and Fiction" is scheduled Saturday morning, 9 to noon at Bedford Middle School, and a Jerry Pinkney Film Festival caps the event next Sunday at 2 p.m. in the Bernhard Library. 

Russian Chamber Choir
 While on tour, the dozen or so men of Chorovaya Akademia, the Russian Men's Chamber Choir, are not attired in their somber floor-length gowns nor can they be surrounded by the elaborate architecture of a traditional Russian Orthodox Church. But they lose none of the powerful, deeply resonating sound of the three centuries of Russia's sacred music and secular works that they perform. This is the fifth visit to the United States by the 14-year-old choir, which has toured the world and become a best-selling recording group. Rachmaninoff's "Vespers" and works by Tchaikovsky will be featured at the choir's concert is Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in Norwalk's City Hall, 125 East Avenue. Tickets are $28. Information: (203)452-5823, extension 328.

Jewish Film Festival
 Sixteen richly varied comedies, dramas and an Academy Award-winning documentary, all produced between 1997 and 2002 in the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Israel, and Australia, are to be shown Saturday through April 2 in Hartford. The Wadsworth Atheneum, Trinity College and the Greater Hartford Jewish Community Center, sponsors of the Hartford Jewish Film Festival, will cooperate in providing their auditoriums for screenings.
Dr. Annette Insdorf, author and director of undergraduate film studies at Columbia University, will speak after the opening film, "Monsieur Batignole" (France 2001), is shown Saturday at 7:30 at the Atheneum. Opening night tickets, including the film, lecture and reception are $35, but tickets for most films thereafter will be $5 or $7. "Monsieur Batignole," set in 1942, is a portrait of an ordinary French butcher whose passive view of collaborating with the Germans changes when the son of a local Jewish family managed to return after his family was deported and their apartment was given to the Batignoles. In a comedy titled "Advice and Dissent," (U.S. 2001) Eli Wallach portrays a rabbi who is asked by an unhappily married business man to put a curse on the man's wife. "Empty Rooms" (Israel 2002) records interviews with survivors and victims' families a year after 21 people were killed in the suicide bombing of a disco on Tel Aviv's sea promenade. Another film was inspired by Artie Shaw's popular 1940 recording of "Gloomy Sunday," reportedly so melancholy that it drove some people to suicide. In 1999 Germany produced a film with the song's title, using flashbacks of a troubled love triangle in 1930's Budapest. Schedule and tickets: (860)231-6325. 

Spinning Tales in Greenwich
 Jonathan Kruk has a way with the spoken word, the telling gesture, the sprinkling of humor and the appropriate costume for a smorgasbord of stories. He has been entertaining children and adults for more than two decades, giving 3,000 performances and storytelling workshops a year and appearing on public television and The History Channel. He will be in Greenwich spinning tales from oral and written history today in two appearances, the first at 12:30 and then 2 p.m. He will focus on the people of Horseneck, now known as Greenwich, and how they fared during the Revolutionary War. The program is free and will be held at the Historical Society of Greenwich's Bush-Holley House, 39 Strickland Avenue in the Cos Cob section of town. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: Doctors Upset Over Malpractice. Patients Are, Too. 

BYLINE:  By JANE GORDON 

 BODY:
SPEAK to a Hartford obstetrician and hear about how he made far less money this year than last, how he is paying $83,000 a year in malpractice insurance, the equivalent of the statewide median income for a family of four. His solution: do away with high malpractice awards.
 Speak to a lawyer and hear the story of a once vibrant Brookfield woman who was found to have a tumor on her liver, whose doctor was made aware of the growth but never acted on it, and who now lives in pain in her bedroom. Should she have a limit placed on a malpractice award that might soften the blow of a life gone awry? 
 Until recently, two billboards at Trumbull and Whitney streets in New Haven offered dueling messages on the issue. "Injured? Get Carter!" reads an advertisement for Carter Mario, a personal injury lawyer with offices in Milford, Waterbury and Hartford. A few feet away, "Will Connecticut Be Next? Can Your Doctor Stay in Practice?" read the other, courtesy of the Connecticut State Medical Society. 
Lawyers and doctors are straining to be heard as the State Legislature considers possible solutions to soaring malpractice costs. Those voices include plaintiffs, insurance companies, professors, medical ethicists. On Wednesday, in an event organized by the medical society, many doctors plan to gather at the Capitol to advocate for caps on awards for pain and suffering, already in place in 26 states.
The doctors have the backing of the state insurance commissioner and the state and national medical societies. The American Medical Association announced on March 3 it had added Connecticut to its list of malpractice crisis states.
"The big question is, can your doctor stay in practice?" said Tim Norbeck of the Connecticut State Medical Society, who rattled off a list of insurance rate increases over the last year for medical specialists throughout the state: 72 percent for neurologists, 55 percent for family physicians, 30 percent for pathologists. "Unless something is done to address this crisis, physicians will be forced out of practice. This will have a tremendous impact on access to care. Already, 25 to 40 obstetricians in the state have indicated they will no longer be able to deliver babies."
Richard A. Silver, senior partner with Silver, Golub & Teitell in Stamford, who is chairman of the Medical Malpractice Committee of the Connecticut Trial Lawyers' Association, said the solution rests with the insurance companies and not with limiting what malpractice victims receive.
"The real issue is what the insurance companies are charging," he said. "In Connecticut, we have an insurance commissioner who allows the medical malpractice insurers to charge whatever they want.
"When you're talking about limiting awards to $250,000, there will be no agreement with me," Mr. Silver said. "Patients have a right to be fairly compensated based on their particular loss; $250,000 is a one-size-fits-all solution and I don't think it's proper."
Mr. Silver had many stories to tell, but the one that first put him on the malpractice map was decided in 1976, in Katsetos v. Nolan. Freda Katsetos gave birth to her fourth child at St. Joseph's Hospital in Stamford. Twenty minutes later, she lapsed into shock from severe internal bleeding, which went undiagnosed by her doctors. She died soon after. The final determination: a $400,000 award. 
Mr. Silver has on his side the acting chairman of the Connecticut chapter of the New England Patients' Rights Group, Steve Govoni of Norwalk, who lost his wife to a routine allergy shot in 1998. She died of anaphylactic shock in a doctor's office in Norwalk, in front of their two children, who were then 4 and 2. Mr. Govoni filed a lawsuit against the doctor in 1999. He said he is opposed to caps on pain and suffering awards. 
"I want to see responsible parties held accountable," Mr. Govoni said. "People should be able to bring litigation and preserve their rights."
Others consider caps flawed for more expansive reasons, including Zita Lazzarini, a public-health lawyer who serves on the ethics committee at Hartford Hospital and runs a program on medical humanities, health law and ethics at the University of Connecticut medical school. She calls caps "a blunt-instrument solution" to the problem.
"The purpose of the malpractice system is to deter negligence and compensate people who are injured," she said. "But it isn't particularly good at doing either of those. Of all the cases where something is clearly notup to the standard of care, a minority of those file suit, and a minority get compensated. So it's hard to argue that it's a deterrent to bad behavior, hard to argue it's compensating the people who were harmed due to negligence." 
In 2002, 368 medical malpractice lawsuits were filed in Connecticut, according to the State Superior Court in Hartford. That number changed little during the past 10 years, from a low of 272 in 1991 to 1992 to a high of 389 in 1998 to 1999. Malpractice insurance rates soared, however, particularly in the late 1990's. Some lawyers and consumer groups said they believed the rate increases were part of an economic cycle. Others said they believed poor investments by malpractice insurers created losses the companies are seeking to recoup through higher rates.
"With the decline in interest rates and stock valuations over the past two years, insurers were not able to rely on investment earnings to maintain profit margins and are now choosing to increase premiums," said a study released in January by Tom Baker, the director of the Insurance Law Center at the University of Connecticut. Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's consumer advocacy group, also faulted the poor economy and unwise insurance company investments in a report released in January.
"Financial mismanagement by the industry is also a factor," the report said. It blamed underpriced premiums, out-of-control cash-flow and involvement with Enron for prompting one major carrier, the St. Paul Companies, to stop offering malpractice coverage. 
"Investment income goes down, companies leave the market, competition is gone, rates go way up," said Christopher Bernard, president of the Connecticut Trial Lawyers Association and a partner in Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, a Bridgeport firm specializing in malpractice. "The doctors are squeezed in the middle. They can't pass on those costs."
Insurance companies don't see it that way.
"We are extremely conservative in our investments," said a spokesman for ProMutual, a Massachusetts company that operates as ProSelect in Connecticut. He detailed the company's investments, noting most are in government securities and bonds. "It's simple why costs are going up," he said. "The amount of money it costs to settle claims continues to go up. All insurance is a sharing of risk."
California has a $250,000 cap and also adopted price controls on insurance premiums. But the cap is believed to have hampered the ability of those injured by malpractice to find a lawyer to take their cases due to low payouts. 
Florida has a complex system that includes binding arbitration, which the Florida Legislature is trying to make more attractive to parties involved in malpractice complaints. The arbitration system has a cap of $250,000.
"Doctors don't like to use it because they fear it's an admission of liability and they fear it will impact their license," said Scott McMillen of McMillen, Reinhart & Voght, an Orlando malpractice firm. "We're trying to get a statute change so it is not an admission of fault, so more doctors will be willing to do it. That's the kind of thing that gets cases out of the court system." The Connecticut State Medical Society said it would support an arbitration system as long as the $250,000 cap applies to all cases.
A cap on pain and suffering awards, formally known as noneconomic damages, will stabilize the market, said Connecticut's insurance commissioner, Susan Cogswell. At the same time, the Legislature is reviewing a system other states have adopted, called prior rate approval, in which the commissioner mustdeem whether the rates insurance companies charge are acceptable. 
Neurosurgeons and obstetrician-gynecologists pay among the highest rates for malpractice annually, from about $80,000 to $125,000. Some said they are changing their lives to accommodate the high rates. 
One ob-gyn, Michael Morosky, is leaving his Hartford-Hospital-based practice after 19 years, including several as codirector of labor and delivery at the hospital. Dr. Morosky paid $83,000 this year for $2 million in malpractice insurance, up from about $53,000 last year for $7 million in coverage. Next year, he expects his costs to be more than $100,000 for even less insurance coverage, about $1 million. He has taken a job at Johnson Memorial Hospital in Stafford Springs, one that will require him to work 100 hours a week - much like the hours he worked when he first started out in obstetrics - instead of the 72 hours he now works in his practice. The hospital lured him there by pledging to pay him a department-head salary that would cover his increases in malpractice insurance. 
"I hate that I have to move," he said. "I hate that I have to tell my patients that this is the last time I will be seeing them. I hate to have to leave a practice I've built for 19 years, a hospital I've loved. I'm doing it because of malpractice. If I hadn't been taking pay cuts for three years, I wouldn't consider doing this. It's the only way I can see that I can continue delivering babies in Connecticut. Otherwise, I'd have to move to another state."
Unlike other doctors, he does not like the idea of a cap on awards, "because I think somebody should get more than $250,000 for a baby who is damaged and it's somebody's fault," he said. "But if next year's insurance costs go up another $30,000, half the ob's at Hartford Hospital are going to stop delivering babies."
A Norwalk doctor, Robin Appleby, plans to do just that. After practicing obstetrics for 25 years, he informed the other doctors in his practice that he would stop delivering newborns in August. 
"I trained 14 years after high school, I worked 100 hours a week, I've saved over 500 lives and now they're going to come and take my house," Dr. Appleby said. "Something is wrong here. All Americans want to sue. I think the whole system is going to collapse, and then maybe we'll get some progress. Cut out the lawyers, set up a fund of taxpayer money and just pay the people. You're not seeing malpractice, you're seeing mal-occurrence, bad outcomes." 
The issue has not lowered the number of ob-gyns practicing in the state; in 2001, the first year the State Department of Public Health began tracking doctors by specialty, 781 were licensed to practice in Connecticut. In 2003, 819 are licensed. For neurosurgeons, the trend is the same: 96 neurosurgeons were licensed to practice in 2001, 108 in 2003. 
Ms. Lazzarini said she has a potential answer to the problem: Change the system, creating a higher standard of review for doctors and a greater safety net for those hurt while getting medical care.
"We don't have a great system of peer review for doctors and we could do better," she said. "The system is dependent upon complaints. Waiting for people to be injured and to sue - this is not the ideal."

HEADLINE: The Big Gamble 

BYLINE:  By JULIA C. MEAD 

 BODY:
FOR years, members of the Shinnecock Indian Nation begged Southampton Town to take a hard line on development around their reservation, and to help them reclaim lands they said were stolen from their ancestors. They formed a land defense committee, filed suit, organized protest marches and sat down in front of bulldozers.
 Nothing worked. The town approved nearly every subdivision application that came before it. High-priced houses sprang up where the Shinnecocks said they once buried their dead, held sacred ceremonies, hunted and fished. The latest insult came in February 2000 when state troopers broke up a peaceful protest, handcuffing and dragging away three tribal members and a non-Indian civil rights activist. 
 Last month, after all four protesters had their disorderly conduct and resisting arrest charges dismissed, they filed a discrimination suit against the state troopers. But members of the tribe said they had given up waiting for the courts to deliver justice or the deed to their ancestral lands. 
"You can be poor and passive and invisible all your life, or you can take the opportunities that come your way finally," said Rebecca Genia, 46, one of those arrested. "Before every inch of our sacred hills are lost, we will fight fire with fire."
As the Mashantucket Pequots and the Mohegans did in Connecticut, the Shinnecocks are negotiating to build a bingo hall and casino on 79 acres of tribal land in Hampton Bays. The bayfront parcel called Westwoods, near the Shinnecock Canal, and the tribe's 800-acre reservation just outside Southampton village are the sum total of its land holdings.
Members of the tribe said last week that the final details of their agreement with a casino developer, Ivy K. Ong, were still being hammered out. Though by law they need federal recognition as a tribe to operate a casino, a process that has taken other tribes 15 or more years, Mr. Ong has advised them that a legal loophole could allow them to open without it. 
Mr. Ong and tribal leaders declined to discuss any details of their legal strategy or their construction project until a contract is signed. People close to the negotiations said the contract would include a $1.5 million payment to help the tribe accelerate its application for federal recognition. The Shinnecocks are already recognized by New York State.
"These are cautious people," Mr. Ong said. "This is the first big thing they've tried to do as a tribe and they want to get it right."
Lance Gumbs, one of three elected tribal trustees, said the tribe's sole source of income had been its annual Labor Day weekend pow-wow, washed out last year by bad weather.
"Clearly, we need some kind of economic development and a majority want to do gaming," Mr. Gumbs said.
Even as other Indian tribes across the country opened profitable gambling operations after their right to do so was recognized by the federal government in 1988, the Shinnecocks rejected gaming as a non-Indian activity. That aversion apparently eased after new tribal leaders were elected two years ago, and last November the tribe voted to authorize negotiations for a casino.
"We don't move fast as a people," said Mr. Gumbs, who declined to give his age. "It took us 15 years to change leadership. But we're angry now and that may push us to move more quickly."
He said the tribe had also talked with Harrah's, which manages tribal casinos in four western states. David Strow, a Harrah's spokesman, declined to confirm or deny the existence of any discussions but called Westwoods, with its proximity to New York City, "a prime location." Although a few (including Mr. Gumbs) benefit mightily from the sale of tax-free cigarettes and others have jobs off the reservation, many tribal members said they live in poverty. A Shinnecock who asked that he not be identified said the psychological impact of growing up poor in the shadow of all those Hamptons mansions had been devastating in a lot of ways to a lot of Shinnecocks.
The chairman of the tribal council, Frederick Bess, and the other two trustees, James Eleazer and Charles K. Smith II, did not return calls or declined to discuss their plans. But those Shinnecocks who would speak to a reporter were emphatic about their motivation.
"We're seeking an opportunity to develop in the modern world, to join in the economic growth of this country," said Elizabeth Thunderbird Haile, 71, who is Ms. Genia's aunt.
Southampton residents who have been shown preliminary construction plans said the 52,000-square-foot, one-story building would contain a casino, a bingo hall and a restaurant. With the right amount of money, contractors said, construction of the prefabricated steel building could be fast-tracked to finish by May.
"If we have to sacrifice some land to save the rest, that's what we'll do," Ms. Genia said. "Hopefully, people will understand. If not, they'll have to live with it. We've been living with it long enough."
The casino would not be the largest building in Southampton. The industrialist Ira Rennert is building a 60,000-square-foot, three-story building in Sagaponack as a private residence. A nursing home, also under construction, covers 66,000 square feet off County Road 39.
But neither place would generate the congestion that would come with a casino. Non-Indians and elected officials from the town to the federal levels are mobilizing to block the project, arguing that it would increase crime as well as traffic. Residents have started two anti-casino Web sites and sought advice from Connecticut residents who unsuccessfully fought construction of the Indian-owned Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun casinos.
Southampton Town hired a consultant to gauge the potential impacts. State Senator Kenneth LaValle and Assemblyman Fred Thiele have asked to meet with the Shinnecocks. Senator Charles E. Schumer wrote a letter of protest to the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, which will review the Shinnecock application for tribal recognition. And Representative Timothy Bishop met with tribal leaders on Feb. 28, reporting that night to a standing-room-only crowd at a Hampton Bays Civic Association meeting only that he was optimistic for additional talks.
Later, he said he would "do everything I can to develop alternatives, more compatible uses of the land that will give them the same sort of cash flow."
Denise Scheuring, who lives with her husband and two daughters in a house that abuts Westwoods, asserted that a casino "would totally destroy our neighborhood." She and her neighbors contend that the roads are already gridlocked by summer tourism and the year-round "trade parade," the procession of tradesmen headed to and from the South Fork's still-frenzied building boom.
"I don't want to run, but I refuse to let my children live next to a casino," Ms. Scheuring said.
Not all South Fork residents are opposed to the casino. J. Robert Zellner, a Southampton resident, co-chairman of the National Civil Rights Coordinating Committee and one of those arrested at the Shinnecock protest in 2000, has helped form the Shinnecock Neighbors Care Committee to combat the "shrill cries and vigilante tactics" of the opposition.
"It has occurred to many citizens of good will that some of the most vociferous opponents of the Shinnecock Nation have the least moral authority," Mr. Zellner said in a written statement.
Robert Congdon of Preston, Conn., a state assemblyman, said the casinos in his area have irrevocably changed his community. Traffic in Preston went from 7,000 car trips a day to nearly 30,000, while emergency services calls went from 200 a year to 1,000, he said.
Mr. Congdon said Ledyard, the hamlet nearest the casinos, used to be a low-crime area but now has one of the highest crime rates in the state. He also said the casinos had raised the local school district's percentage of special-education students to double the state average, had created a housing shortage and a litter problem, and in general had strained public services nearly to the breaking point. He estimated the cost to Preston alone at $1 million a year. Last year for the first time, the state sent $500,00 in local impact aid.
"It's not nearly enough," he said.
But Mr. Congdon also said that the casinos created tens of thousands of jobs at a time when major employers were laying off and that their gaming compacts with the state bring some $400 million into state coffers each year, more than all the corporate taxes collected statewide. He also noted that the Mohegans spent $35 million to improve the highway leading to their casino complex.
With an estimated $1 billion each in annual gross receipts, Foxwoods and Mohegan Sun -- the largest and second largest casinos in the world -- have given their tribal owners the kind of economic power the Shinnecocks dream of.
Three years ago, the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis reported that Foxwoods alone had raised the gross state product by $1.2 billion and had, directly and indirectly, created 41,363 jobs. Its diverse business holdings and capital reinvestment made the tribe "an economic growth marvel" for the region, the report said.
Both casinos there grew from bingo halls using money from non-Indian investors, as the Shinnecocks are now considering. And both have used gaming profits to expand their real estate holdings and improve their members' standards of living. Neither would disclose their annual net income from gaming, but both were eager to describe the benefits that derive from it.
Profits from Foxwoods have paid for housing, education, a native language revitalization program, a day care center, a health clinic, a tribal court and police and fire departments, said Cedric Woods, a spokesman for the 700-member Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. The casino has also bankrolled one of the largest and most extensive Native American museums and research centers in the country, a $193 million investment, and has expanded its reservation from 200 acres to more than 1,400 acres, Mr. Woods said.
"The tribe reaches out to relatives, looks for them," Mr. Woods said. "Now they can help give them a home, a job, day care, and education for their children."
Foxwoods, built near Ledyard in 1992 with money from Malaysian investors and expanded several times, has helped the tribe buy up hotels, golf courses, and other businesses. It donated $2 million to the Special Olympics, $10 million to the National Museum of the American Indian, and several million more to the Mystic Aquarium and a regional economic development scheme, Mr. Woods said.
Jayne Fawcett, whom the Mohegans have designated as their ambassador general, said the Mohegan Sun complex was opened in 1996 in Uncasville "to show that Indians, just as other people, can change and be part of the future."
"Our older people used to say they were the last generation. That was disturbing to us," Ms. Fawcett said. Since achieving federal recognition in 1994 after a 17-year struggle, Mohegans who lived far away have rejoined the tribe, which now has more than 1,000 members. She said the tribe now has an unprecedented self-esteem and "pride in who we are."
Mark F. Brown, chairman of the Mohegan tribal council, said: "We were a blue-collar tribe before. Now we have other abilities. We can set higher standards for ourselves." He added that "any tribal member would tell you their life is better."
The Mohegans' gaming profits finance cultural education including a language restoration project; housing fortribal elders; a museum and church. They have bought back ancestral burial grounds, produced historical documentary films and helped other tribes, including the Lakota Sioux and the Shinnecocks themselves.
Like the Mashantucket Pequots, the Mohegans have also used their windfall to pay tuition for tribal members to attend private schools, college and graduate school. Last year, all but one of the tribe's 29 high school graduates went on to college, Ms. Fawcett said.
Shinnecocks said they look forward to being able to do many of the same things for their tribe, especially to buy back land they believe ought to have been theirs by right.
"We tried sitting in front of a bulldozer, but no one will take us seriously until we have the green stuff," Ms. Genia said.
But it is one thing to build two huge casinos in a rural, sparsely populated corner of Connecticut, and quite another to put a casino in the middle of one of the biggest traffic bottlenecks on Long Island, and in a resort area that cherishes its self-image as a quiet retreat.
Tom Garber, who lives on Newtown Road, a winding country lane and the only current approach to Westwoods, is an opposition organizer. "We're not against the Indians," Mr. Garber said. "We're against a casino in a residential area. We believe property values will drop and it won't be possible to live here anymore."
But first the Shinnecocks must establish that they have the right to open a casino. Shinnecock leaders and Mr. Ong declined to discuss the legal loophole that they contend gives them the right to open a casino without federal recognition. Jackson King, a lawyer for the Mashantucket Pequots, surmised that it stemmed from laws permitting Indians the same rights as charities that run "Las Vegas" and bingo nights. Nedra Darling, a spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs, said there are 562 federally recognized tribes and about 200 others going through the application process. She said the Shinnecocks first filed their application in 1978 but had made little progress toward completing it.
The criteria necessitate extensive research and documentation, including that a tribe has existed since white settlers first arrived, has maintained a tribal government and an identity, and that its members have bloodlines to a known tribal member.
Although recognition carries a host of benefits, including federal funds for housing, education, food programs and health services, the most lucrative by far is the potential for gaming. By law, only a federally recognized tribe may negotiate a gaming compact with a state governor. Governor Pataki has been amenable to signing compacts with upstate tribes and to the state revenue they engender, but Stacy Clifford, a spokeswoman for the state Racing and Wagering Board, said the Shinnecocks' case "is pretty cut and dry, as far we're concerned. They need federal recognition to open a casino. Period." She and Mr. Strow, of Harrah's, both said no other tribe had been able to open a casino without it.
Assemblyman Thiele said he contacted the governor's office and was told the state attorney general and the Racing and Wagering Board would come down hard and fast on any illegal gaming operation.
But several Shinnecocks, all of whom asked that they not be identified, said Mr. Ong had already sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to Monteau & Peebles, a Sacramento, Calif.-based law firm specializing in Native American law. The Shinnecocks said the firm's research shows they have the same right to operate a casino as any other tribe in the state. Ms. Clifford saidthree federally recognized tribes now operate casinos in New York: the St. Regis Mohawks near the Canadian border, the Oneidas in the Syracuse area and the Senecas, who opened theirs at Niagara Falls on New Year's Eve.
Under federal gaming laws, casinos are pegged Class III operations; the Seneca reservation also contains a Class II operation, a bingo hall, which is not predicated on federal recognition. Some Shinnecocks said they might open a bingo hall first, as the Mohegans and Mashantucket Pequots did.
Robert DeLuca, president of Group for the South Fork, is one of the few non-Indians who worked with the Shinnecocks on their land preservation campaign. He said his environmental organization opposes a casino but supports the tribe becoming self-sufficient. Mr. DeLuca said he feared any casino developer would "play hardball," exploiting the Shinnecocks by pushing them into debt and into breaking the law.
"It's a high-risk proposition," he said.
Mr. King said he was disappointed to hear that the Shinnecocks were negotiating with Mr. Ong, and wondered whether the tribe had done sufficient background checks on him.
Mr. Ong, who served four months under house arrest for his part in a 1995 counterfeit baby-formula scheme, called his guilty plea to misdemeanor charges a matter of expediency. He also disputed press reports that he patronized a slain Las Vegas loan shark and is a subject of a federal grand jury probe into the Seminoles' gaming operation in Oklahoma.
"My hands are clean," he said, emphasizing that he helped several tribes realize enormous profits through gaming. In addition to the four sites he helped the Seminoles develop, he has had contracts with three other Oklahoma tribes and bankrolled a gaming hall in Mexico and two in Texas.
"I have a good record," Mr. Ong said. "I'm a risk-taker, but I make money for everyone." 
Unperturbed, the Shinnecocks said they were determined to steer their own course.
"We have been here for 3,000 years," Ms. Haile said. "That gives you a certain perspective: We belong here. We have the right to do what we're doing."

No, March Is the Cruelest Month

BYLINE:  By DEBRA GALANT 

 BODY:
THIS is the time of year when people do crazy things, like trying to balance eggs on the sidewalk -- an arcane practice that has something to do with the vernal equinox, a time of exquisite balance, when night and day are exactly the same length. It's a little like the precarious state of the world. 
 Spring came a little early this year, but after three months of abundant snow and bitter cold temperatures, it wasn't a bit too soon. 
 The weather last weekend, for instance, was so delightful (that's the technical term that meteorologists use) that everybody who wasn't trapped in an iron lung decided to get a first-hand view. 
My street looked like a scene from the Easter Parade, a procession of strollers, bicycles, Rollerblades, scooters and plastic toddler all-terrain vehicles -- enough to induce motion sickness in a person sitting on the front porch. Brookdale Park in Essex County was so thick with nature worshippers that it was actually dangerous to bike there. Children were even willing to abandon their Nintendos and go outside.
Of course, there were bizarre contrasts. Children played croquet in front yards still half- filled with snow, and shamrocks stood flag-by-flag with laggard Santas. Orange-aproned employees with bullhorns serenaded the parking lot of the Home Depot in Bloomfield to promote a sidewalk sale that refused to take a seasonal point of view. Ceiling fans, patio fireplaces, planters, kitchen tiles and area rugs were all offered at steep discounts, at an event resembling a corporate garage sale. 
And then there was an unexpected trifecta of good news: Elizabeth Smart was found alive, musicians were fiddling again on Broadway and the Yankees were coming to Cablevision. 
From there the news took on a middling tinge, with Governor McGreevey's half-full, half-empty announcement that he would try to restore some of the arts budget that he had vowed to cut only weeks earlier.
And then the grim. A bizarre new flu-like and fatal disease. United Nations weapons inspectors warned to leave Iraq. Homeland security going orange on St. Patrick's Day -- again. All this when all anybody wanted to do was sit outside, enjoy the weather and suspend reality a little longer.
The Greeks explained spring by way of Persephone, abducted to the underworld for half the year, but returned to earth each spring. Each year, darkness gives way to light. The days begin to grow longer than the nights. The earth warms, and its inhabitants celebrate.
But this year, things are topsy-turvy. The world has become one big good news-bad news joke. The good news is that the snow has melted, the bad news is that $15 million in pothole repairs await. The good news is that the air feels great, the bad news is that soon it could be filled with biological poisons. The good news is that at least we're not the exact middle of the terrorist bulls-eye of Manhattan, the bad news is we're far too close. 
The headlines are more fickle than even the weather. War is upon us, the stock market goes up. One day "The Sopranos" is cancelled, the next James Gandolfini and HBO sign a deal.
Spring has always been alive with contradictions. T.S. Eliot, after all, had a pretty good take on April. But perhaps this year it took the odd combination of a spring thaw giving way to geopolitical meltdown to make it painfully obvious.
They say it is a sign of intellectual maturity to hold two opposing ideas in your mind at the same time, but what we really want is a simple Hallmark spring: green lawns, daffodils, warmth, chocolate eggs.
To Patricia Tratebas, a landscape designer and owner of Cottage Gardens, a struggling nursery in East Orange, spring is a landscaper's busy season, equivalent to December for Macy's, though half of her inventory turned brown when her greenhouse lease ended in early March, just as temperatures plunged yet again. The big February blizzard came the week of the New Jersey Flower Show, the biggest marketing event of the year. The drought ruined last season. The economy threatens this one. 
Don't think green this spring. Think brown for mud.
On the other hand, there is compost, the rich black organic matter that is created by everything icky. New Jersey is filled with maggots, and that, according to Ms. Tratebas, is good.
"The world would be a terrible, horrible place without maggots," she said. "It's all about decay. It's all about those things that you don't want to know are out there."

HEADLINE: As Camden Struggles, Help From the Courts 

BYLINE:  By JEREMY PEARCE 

DATELINE: CAMDEN 

 BODY:
ON the city's waterfront, a school of fish swims a restless patrol around a sunken pile of rusted beams and twisted debris. The striped bass follows an Atlantic needlefish, which tails a herring in an endless circling that fixes visitors beside the glass at the New Jersey State Aquarium.
 Outside the exhibit, city officials and residents here have been trapped in a similar state of suspension. The revival of Camden's waterfront -- which has grown to include a baseball park, a performing arts center and a battleship museum -- has failed to spark a wider renewal in this deteriorating city of 79,800, a former manufacturing hub for tomato soup and record players that is now burdened with more than 3,000 wrecked or abandoned properties and considered to be a perpetual beggar for funds at Trenton's table. 
 "People drive to the ship, to the aquarium, and then out they go," said Jorge Flores, a barber whose Market Street storefront sits only blocks from the attractions. 
After a string of break-ins -- including one in which a burglar left part of a finger -- Mr. Flores recently had to install bars over the shop's windows. "This is like working in a cage," he said. "People don't stop to spend any money down here."
Last Tuesday, a legal decision made in state Superior Court in Trenton finally opened the gates for a $175 million flood intended to wash away Camden's woes. Judge Andrew J. Smithson dismissed lawsuits brought by a city councilman and school board members, although a third suit, filed by a gadfly landlord, remains to be resolved. Regardless, the ruling broke through any temporary legal sandbags put up to halt a wave of state bond money headed into New Jersey's poorest city.
"In exchange for state funding, we are being subjected to a virtual dictatorship," declared Frank Fulbrook, the disgruntled landlord, who called the aid agreement unconstitutional. "And it's the price of giving up democracy that bothers me."
It is true that Camden's cash boon has not come cheaply. Under provisions of the Municipal Rehabilitation and Economic Recovery Act, signed into law by Governor McGreevey last year, the city will be handing off a healthy share of its self-rule. A state-appointed chief operating officer -- Melvin Primas, a former mayor of Camden known as Randy -- will soon have the power to veto decisions made by the city council and zoning board. Mr. Primas also holds the strings to the deep purse of state aid, becoming a sort of viceroy amid local leaders.
"The legislation certainly gives me a big stick," he said. "But no rational person is going to believe we can turn around the ills of this city in the next five years."
Mr. Primas added that the law grants Mr. McGreevey a right to veto actions by the school board, and empowers the governor to name three of the nine board members.

Troubled Police Department
But money woes are not all that is plaguing Camden. Almost two weeks ago, the acting state Attorney General, Peter Harvey, directed the Camden County prosecutor's office to take control of the city police department, moving on public complaints about officers and inconsistent record-keeping -- and putting the final touches on what appeared to be Camden's coup.
Somewhat surprisingly, most city leaders have not shown resistance -- at least in public. "Mr. Primas is welcome here," said Angel Fuentes, president of the city council. "We share one city. We all have one vision."
For her part, Mayor Gwendolyn A. Faison has also taken the sunny view, having lobbied for the bond issue and criticized its detractors. "The mayor is ready to rock and roll; now we can move ahead and get this annual budget adopted," said Tony C. Evans, a spokesman, referring to a $15 million deficit in Camden's current operating budget that, before the court ruling, was suggested would force layoffs of city workers.
Even so, Mr. Fulbrook and other critics are questioning the division of the state money, arguing that institutions -- and not the community at large -- may be taking too large a slice of the pie.
The legislation specifies that $47.7 million, or slightly more than a quarter of the financing, will go to colleges and hospitals, with $13 million for Cooper Hospital/University Medical Center and $11 million awarded to the Rutgers-Camden campus. Other beneficiaries to receive lesser sums include Rowan University, Camden County College, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center.
Mr. Primas bristles at the suggestion. "The whole premise that the $175 million is not going to benefit the residents of Camden is bizarre to me," he said.
He continued: "It never was a bill designed to put dollars in the pockets of residents. It is aimed at making civic improvements. We can create an educational campus here that will benefit our young people."
In a city where 40 percent of the population is under the age of 18, education is an obvious issue. State Assemblywoman Nilsa Cruz-Perez, a Camden Democrat who voted for the aid legislation, put the situation this way: her son leaves the high school here when he needs to use the bathroom. "There's drug-dealing going on in the bathrooms, and there aren't even textbooks in the classrooms," Ms. Cruz-Perez said. "How dare they say this legislation is unconstitutional. It's the poverty here that is unconstitutional."
Frank Moran, a city councilman, said the situation had become so dire that he, for one, did not hesitate in the face of the state's takeover. "We have a trend of a 50 to 70 percent school dropout rate," Mr. Moran said. "And people willnot drive through a neighborhood where they have a concern for their safety."
State Senator Wayne R. Bryant, the Camden Democrat who was the prime sponsor of the aid bill, said the state bonds would likely be issued in coming weeks. The bulk of the aid, about $124 million, is earmarked for updating the city's water and sewer systems -- removing decrepit pipes that are in some cases more than 100 years old -- demolishing abandoned structures, acquiring land and cleaning polluted brownfields. A $25 million slice has been set aside for expanding and improving the state aquarium, which is in the process of being privatized. In most cases, legislators said the financing is aimed at leveraging dollars from private investors to maximize the economic effects.
As Camden struggles to salve the damage of decades, however, some still wonder at the not-so-hidden costs. Mr. Flores, the barber, points his scissors toward the former RCA Victor building between Market and Cooper Streets near his shop. The plant where phonographs were once made is being divided into 341 luxury lofts -- a welcome harbinger for the city at large, but a threat nonetheless to Mr. Flores.
"The investors see something happening, come in and move all of the local people out," he said, adding that his rent had doubled this year, after two decades in the shop. "I can't afford to buy a whole building and I have no place to go."
Rocky Wilson, a music teacher who moved into the inner city from nearby Haddonfield in the 1970's, agreed. Population figures show that, with 10,000 residents departing in just the past 10 years, the number of Camden residents today is about half of the total of the 1950's, when Campbell Soup, RCA and the river port were at full stride. Not surprisingly, housing prices remain among the lowest in the state, with an average value of $40,000.
"The time is coming when they're going to raise our property taxes," Mr. Wilson said. "We'll have more amenities and the bad areas will improve, but there's eventually going to be a cost."
But Assemblyman Joseph J. Roberts Jr., a Camden Democrat and majority leader who sponsored the aid measure, countered, "This package is designed to make the city self-sufficient, so that it doesn't have to come hat in hand to Trenton every year."
Nowhere is the friction between the city's past and future -- Camden the blue-collar factory port versus Camden the polished riverfront mirror of Philadelphia -- more manifest than in the positions and persons of Mr. Primas and Mr. Fulbrook.
By a quirk of fate, both men attended the same city high school before traveling divergent paths. Mr. Primas, 53, is a graduate of Howard University and served as mayor and city councilman, and as a state commissioner of community affairs, in a 30-year career in banking and government. He now lives in Gibbsboro, outside of Camden.
Mr. Fulbrook, 54, has run two unsuccessful races for mayor and two similarly disappointing races for city council, although he has served on the city's zoning board and still sits on the library board. A former mailer for The Philadelphia Inquirer, he is a landlord who owns buildings and parking lots, and a voluble and self-taught litigator who files his own lawsuits.
Both men are fond of talking about their visions for Camden -- as well as their roles in the renaissance.
"The reality is that the state legislation provides an extraordinary amount of authority to the chief operating officer," said Mr. Primas, who noted that he had been given the power to shift up to 20 percent of the bond money between projects now inthe proposal stage. As chief officer, he earns an annual salary of $175,000. "I have a unique opportunity to make a difference here."
Mr. Fulbrook, who lives in the city, graduated with a bachelor's degree from Rutgers-Camden in December, a double major in urban studies and political science. "Never let college interfere with your education," he advised at one point.
He also said that he would probably file no more lawsuits for now, choosing instead to try the political arena. Mr. Fulbrook is about to mount a third campaign for city council, in a challenge for the seat of its president, Mr. Fuentes.
"There are people here who really like what I do," he confided. "I don't have a big, paid army, but I try to be a good civic leader."

New Hope for the Future
Last week, there were glimmers of positive changes for the city. An environmental consultant disclosed that unusually high levels of lead found in the water of 36 Camden school buildings had apparently been reduced, although county health officials have directed that some of the schools should continue to use bottled water. A lawsuit filed by parents is under way.
The Rev. Floyd L. White III of the Woodland Avenue Presbyterian Church said that he had observed a decline in violence in recent years and that racial tensions between Camden's largely black and Hispanic population had eased. "Our greatest challenges continue to be employment for our adult population and education for our youth," Mr. White said.
And visitors were still trickling to the waterfront. The Camden Children's Garden, which is attached to the state aquarium, drew Terrence Richardson, an airline mechanic, and his son from nearby Marlton.
"You can tell they're trying to turn Camden around," Mr. Richardson said before quickly entering his car and taking a road directly out of the city.

HEADLINE: State Colleges Feel the Squeeze 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA FITZGERALD 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
PRESIDENTS of the state's colleges, facing record cuts in aid next year, say that they are quickly running out of space to accommodate New Jersey's swelling population of high school graduates and that by 2008 students will find it considerably more difficult and more expensive to get a degree.
 That message has resonated with college students. At a time when many youths around the country are carrying antiwar placards, their counterparts in New Jersey recently vented their anger at Governor McGreevey for proposing cuts in the higher education budget for the second year in a row. 
 Some have even taken to calling the governor McGreedy. During the rally a few weeks ago, one placard urged, "Forget Saddam, Exile McGreedy." 
Yet Governor McGreevey insists that he wants to make higher education a priority in his administration. To that end, he convened a higher education conference last November and boldly proposed merging Rutgers with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and the New Jersey Institute of Technology to create a single, world-class research university.
But presidents of the 12 state colleges and universities say bold ideas are not enough without the money behind them. And as the state continues to cut funds, college officials say they are being forced to seek unwelcome increases in tuition. 
In the last five years alone, the average state college tuition -- excluding Rutgers, the University of Medicine and Dentistry and the Institute of Technology -- has increased 48 percent. A student attending a state college in the fall of 1997 paid an average $3,060 in tuition. Today that cost is $4,531. At Rutgers, the average annual tuition five years ago was $4,262. This year it was $5,770, an increase of about 34 percent. 
"Parents' greatest concerns are the unpredictability of tuition increases," said Paul Shelly, a spokesman for the New Jersey State College Governing Boards Association. "We can't predict because we don't know from year to year what our level of funding will be."
So far, proposed cuts in higher education for the coming budget year total more than $100 million, representing about a 12 percent reduction in aid to the state colleges and universities. Many educators are speculating that tuition at the state's four-year colleges may go up more than 10 percent if New Jersey adopts a bare bones budget in June. Last year, Governor McGreevey cut subsidies by $65 million, and at the same time tuition rose 4 to 12 percent.
College presidents say that beyond cuts to their operating budgets, financing is also falling away for other expenses like matching grants for capital projects, state merit scholarship funds and wage increases for staff and faculty, adding to the financial strain. Making matters worse, nine colleges and universities were recently told that the state simply could not afford to give them all of the money appropriated in this year's budget --a collective loss of $12 million more. 
"There is no question these numbers are getting big," said Darryl Greer, executive director of New Jersey State College Governing Boards Association. 
As state aid is going down, the number of potential students is going up, as the cost of a college education at a state institution in tough economic times becomes far more alluring.

Colleges Already Face Debt
The state's four-year state institutions say they are already highly leveraged with debt, have little ability to meet expected needs in terms of capacity in coming years and have come to rely more on tuition increases to pay their bills.
"The problem is that New Jersey has consistently underbuilt its higher education institutions," said Susan Cole, the president of Montclair State University. "We rank 44th in the country of public enrollment per capita."
Put another way, New Jersey ranks below most states in the number of higher education seats it provides for its residents.
"New Jersey, with a population of 8.4 million, has only one large public doctoral university," Ms. Cole said. "Michigan has eight. Virginia has six. We're way out of whack. What is critical about all this is that New Jersey is a knowledge economy. We don't have land. We don't have oil. We have a pharmaceutical high-tech industry and a communications industry and we're exporting our work force to other states."
In the past, New Jersey didn't worry much about the fact that most of its students left the state after high school. State college presidents would mutter about how New Jersey spent more than most states to educate its students through the 12th grade, only to see its investment dissipate as graduates fanned out to the neighboring states to attend college.
Even today -- with 54 public and private colleges and universities in the state -- New Jersey has the largest percentage in the nation of high school graduates attending college elsewhere, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The latest figures show that on average, 44 percent of high school graduates flee the state to continue their education, resulting in an annual net loss of about 19,000 students.
Many educators say that is because the state has neglected to build up its state colleges and universities.
"The loss to New Jersey's work force is stunning," Ms. Cole said, adding that the state could no longer afford to ignore the problem. 
When the state Department of Higher Education was established in the 1960's, fewer high school graduates were going on to college, and the state investment in the schools was not as substantial. But the number of students graduating from high school is increasing and the percentage of students seeking college degrees is rising proportionately, making the competition for seats in the classroom far more heated.
The numbers tell the story. New Jersey has the fifth-largest growth rate among the states in college-age population, state records show.
According to the New Jersey Commission on Higher Education, as a result of the "baby boom echo," an increase of 19,000 in the number of high school graduates in New Jersey is projected from 2000 to 2008. And from 2005 to 2008, colleges and universities in the state will probably record an overall increase of more than 22,000 students. 
In its recent budget statement, the commission noted, "This significant and sustained increase in the number of high school graduates, coupled with a projected annual increase of 3.3 percent in nontraditional students in need of postsecondary education, necessitates substantially augmented physical capacity and human resources at colleges and universities."
According to the most recent figures compiled by the Commission on Higher Education, there are now 335,930 credit-seeking students at colleges and universities in New Jersey. Of that number, about 20 percent attend private colleges and universities; the rest are enrolled in community colleges and four-year colleges and universities.

Building Has Lagged
As Ms. Cole put it, "We simply have not built the residence halls, haven't built adequate classrooms, science labs or recreational facilities to handle that capacity." 
In South Jersey the problem is even more acute, said Donald Farish, president of Rowan University in Glassboro. While there are 23 public and private four-year colleges and universities north of Trenton, there are only 3 south of Trenton -- Rowan, Stockton and Rutgers-Camden. That means that while South Jersey has 27 percent of the state's population, Mr. Farish said, it has only about 12 percent of the seats for undergraduate instruction.
"We're a rapidly growing population, and the situation is only getting worse," he said, adding that budget cuts were making it much harder to follow through on long-range improvements. 
"We're building our own buildings and using operating dollars to service new debt," Mr. Farish said. "It comes back to the question of what does New Jersey want to have in terms of public higher education. We say we want to have a world-class system of higher education, but we have a third-world budget. You get into a survival mode."
At Rowan alone, he said, plans to add 45 faculty members for the coming year were streamlined, forcing cancellation of at least 15 of those searches.
"The quality of the application pool is extraordinary," he said. "It grieves me to no end to know we have to stop and muddle through with temporary and adjunct faculty."
College presidents -- who consider a long-term financial commitment to higher education in New Jersey essential -- insist that the public would approve a bond issue to allow the state colleges to expand and build for the needs of future students.
While the state has put aside about $8.6 billion to build new public schools around the state, it has not set aside a similar amount for colleges and universities. The last bond set aside was for $550 million in 1999.
Governor McGreevey has privately told college presidents that while he would like to support a bond issue for higher education, he does not know when that will be financially feasible.
For now, he is waiting for the Commission on Higher Education to release a report, expected later this year, on the needs of state colleges and institutions to determine what additional financial support is needed.
In addition to completing the report, the commission is developing a set of objectives for public colleges and universities as well as specific action plans and measures to track performance so that sound financial investments can be made in the future.
That, in turn, raises yet another question: how much authority will the commission wield as far as gaining the cooperation of public institutions or persuading the governor and Legislature to give state colleges more money? Gov. Christie Whitman established the commission in the early 1990's after disbanding the Department of Higher Education as a way of giving colleges and universities more autonomy, but many view it as an ineffectual body. 
"The Whitman administration's abolition of the Department of Higher Education removed an advocate for the system within the governor's cabinet," said Don Linky of the Public Affairs Research Institute. "The creation of the commission in its place established a more muffled voice to speak up for the needs of higher education. The trade-off for more independence for the institutions was a somewhat weaker lobby for the system as a whole in Trenton." 
If money is any indication of its relative influence, the commission may well be having troubles of its own since the governor has recommended that its operating budget be cut in half next year.
"We're hard at work looking at all the issues," said Laurence Downes, chairman of the Commission on Higher Education, who insisted that he was not deterred by the reduction in his budget. "These are challenging times. We'll work within the guidelines. We'll assess all the activities we currently do and adjust to our level of funding."
Historically in New Jersey, college presidents have been unable to command much attention from the Legislature. When asked to identify a single legislator who is a champion for restoring the funds for higher education, college officials essentially scratch their heads. To the contrary, they often face the wrath of lawmakers who annually threaten to pass measures that would block them from raising tuition too much. Last year, in fact, Governor McGreevey threatened that any college or university that raised tuition by more than 10 percent would face an audit.
But the colleges say they are quickly running out of options to meet their financial obligations. 
In the past two decades, state colleges and universities have noted a fluctuating investment in higher education. They received hefty state subsidies under Gov. Thomas H. Kean. But when the economy soured in 1990, Gov. Jim Florio, was forced to cut spending on higher education by about $100 million. 
Yet when the economy rebounded during the two administrations of Governor Whitman, four-year public colleges did not get significant increases in state spending. Instead, she disbanded the Department of Higher Education, giving colleges and universities more freedom from regulation and continually challenging institutions to use their funds more efficiently. Mr. Linky says that in the boom years of the 1990's the Commission on Higher Education had the chance to lobby for a substantial bond for higher education needs. 
"There was a critical need identified for capital investments in higher education and it was conceivable it might have gained political support when things were booming," Mr. Linky said, "but then the economy cooled and the commission started to push for it when it was very unrealistic. There was a window there that the commission didn't seem to go through at the right time."

Why Money Was Diverted
Some speculate that a number of decisions by the state Supreme Court in the mid-90's, which required the state to pump millions of dollars into secondary schools in the state's poor urban districts, drained money from the state budget, some of which might have gone toward higher education.
"New Jersey had unique pressures on its state budget with the commitment required for the funding of the special needs districts under the Abbott V. Burke case," said Mr. Shelly, the spokesman for the New Jersey State College Governing Boards Association. But he noted that there were other budget pressures as well.
According to a study conducted by llinois State University in 1999, spending on higher education in New Jersey increased an average 3.6 percent a year from 1994 to 1999. The nationwide average increase during that same time period was 5.8 percent.
In the coming months, the battle will revolve around how the state's colleges and universities can sustain nearly $100 million in budget cuts without having tuition soar. For now, college presidents are struggling to maintain the historic balance of having students pay for about one-third of the cost of attending a public college or university.
Some costs like salary increases, to be sure, are beyond the control of college presidents. The state negotiates the salary increases for the state institutions, though it does not have to pay for them. For example, last year, the nine state colleges and universities did not receive state funds for $23.1 million in negotiated salary increases.
Without significant increases in tuition, college presidents say, they will have to make tough choices. And for some college students, the cuts enacted by the Legislature may well decide whether they will attend school in New Jersey.
In an effort to keep the state's best students in New Jersey after high school, Governor Whitman started the Outstanding Scholars Recruitment Program in 1997 to provide scholarships to students who ranked among the top 15 percent of their class and who achieved combined College Board scores of 1350 or greater.
Yet that program is about to be suspended. The College of New Jersey has sent out acceptance letters for next September, offering scholarships to more than 800 students. But under the proposed budget, the state will not be paying for any part of those scholarships for incoming freshmen.
Barbara Gitenstein, president of the College of New Jersey, said she thought the state was making a mistake by suspending the program.
"It's a wise investment for the state to do its best to keep those New Jersey citizens in the state," Ms. Gitenstein said.
She put it this way: "New Jersey is not the only state suffering with budget problems. The growth and capacity issues affect other states and they're probably going to be taking care of their own."
"There's no question," she added. "New Jersey has got to make a decision about what it wants."

A Message to McGreevey on Jobs

BYLINE:  By RICHARD GOLDBERG; Richard Goldberg is president of the Commerce and Industry Association of New Jersey.

 BODY:
AS the state Legislature reviews and recommends changes in Governor McGreevey's budget plan, every interest group, including ours, the Commerce and Industry Association of New Jersey, is lobbying the legislators. Our association has called for restoring many business development and attraction programs that have brought thousands of jobs and tens of millions of investment dollars to New Jersey.
 In his budget message, the governor challenged those who want programs restored to find other places to cut. I decided to see how other states have handled their deficits. 
 In Governor McGreevey's budget message, he said, "As we cut government and eliminate programs, there will be downsizing and attrition that will reduce the state payroll by 1,000 workers." Out of 74,859 state workers (as of this week), 1,000 jobs would be eliminated through retirements and open positions not being filled.
When I looked at surrounding states' budget plans, I found that they were doing much more:
In Connecticut, Gov. John G. Rowland has called for reducing the state government work force by thousands of jobs. He also said: "There is no law that says government -- at any level -- must automatically get bigger every year. We cannot keep providing revenue-sharing dollars to our cities and towns when there is no revenue to share. Some municipal leaders have issued dire warnings that unless we continue to give them money the state doesn't have, taxes will have to be raised at the local level. I reject that concept. I do not accept the notion that local governments cannot trim their sails the same way we have at the state level." 
There is a lot of truth to what he is saying.
In his speech to his General Assembly, Mr. Rowland said that in Michigan, the governor will be imposing a 4 percent cut to the general fund budget and laying off 2,000 employees. That is after cutting the state work force by 8,000 employees. In Wisconsin, the governor will eliminate 2,800 state jobs in the next fiscal year. In Virginia, the governor has cut spending by $6 billion and has laid off 4,000 state employees. And he is not just cutting aid to cities and towns. He proposes to eliminate it, totally.
In Pennsylvania, Gov. Edward G. Rendell's budget seeks to invest in the state's future by leveraging $5 billion for economic development and job creation through the use of $2 billion worth of bonds. He said, "I believe that this budget cycle provides the opportunity to start a Pennsylvania recovery instead of waiting for the national economy or the federal government to bail us out."
In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki said in his budget address: "If New York's record prior to 1995 proves anything, it's that high taxes are the surest way to weaken the economy and drive jobs across New York's borders. Conversely, New York's record since 1995 shows that cutting taxes encourages initiative, sparks new investment and creates jobs. Likewise, the record we inherited eight years ago demonstrates that raising taxes discourages initiative and investment and leads to massive job losses. Which means that raising taxes this year -- or any year -- is the wrong choice. We must choose jobs. So today, I urge you to stand with me and send the right message to the New Yorkers who are worried about their jobs, to those who need jobs and to the entrepreneurs who create jobs: Let's take the option of raising job-killing taxes off the table on Day One of this year's budget process." 
Mr. Pataki also said, "Since 1995, we've reduced the size of government by nearly 20,000 positions, while actually increasing efficiency. The budget I present today calls for a state work force reduction of an additional 5,000 positions."
It is time for our state government to share the pain it seeks to impose on everyone else. Really cut the size of New Jersey government. Whether it is a 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent personnel cut across the board for state departments and agencies, that is for the administration to decide. Sure, there are agencies like Corrections that cannot be cut, and there are others like the Division of Youth and Family Services that the governor is rightfully seeking to strengthen, but most others can adjust, as private industry does, to a leaner work force. Such cuts would provide the funds to restore some valuable programs, including those supporting economic growth and job creation. The governor might wish to commission a bipartisan panel to recommend ways to cut the size of New Jersey government. If asked, I would make the time to participate.
Governor McGreevey has the toughest job in New Jersey. I do not envy him, but he is the governor and this is his budget. I believe that it is bad for business and bad for the economy of our state.
The process is now in the hands of the Legislature, whose members are all up for election this year. Those who support economic growth and job creation can gain the support of the business community in November.

HEADLINE: In a Budget Fury, School Officials Seek New Ways to Save 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

 BODY:
School officials routinely pack the marble hallways of the State Capitol to lobby for more money, but things are looking so bleak this year that they flocked to an economy hotel near the Albany airport this month for an altogether different reason: a workshop on how to budget in bad times. 
 The daylong event was a hit, bringing together 340 school superintendents, administrators and board members from across the state. The ones who were around in 1991 for the last major financial crisis wore name tags with the label "survivor." 
 Surviving the current crisis in the schools, however, will take more than just a few tactics picked up at a workshop. School districts are facing a proposed $1.2 billion reduction in state aid next fiscal year, the largest in state history, while incurring sharply rising costs in their day-to-day operations, from health insurance and utility bills to expenses required by higher education standards. 
If that was not bad enough, many school officials say that the problem have been compounded by the state budget process. School districts secure state aid through an intricate dance that begins in January with Gov. George E. Pataki's proposed budget, which always includes education numbers that are lower than the districts would like. The districts and their lobbyists then court the Legislature, and in the end they almost always walk away with more.
The process usually drags past the April 1 budget deadline, forcing nearly all school districts to adopt their budgets without knowing how much state aid to count on and how much they will have to make up by raising property taxes. 
Many districts say they will be forced to propose double-digit increases this year if they get no more than the governor has proposed in aid from the state, which is itself facing a $11.5 billion budget gap over the next two years.
Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Senate Majority Leader Joseph L. Bruno have promised educators in recent weeks that they will restore at least some of the $1.2 billion in cuts proposed by Governor Pataki, but at this point it is unclear how much and when. There is some fear that the state may run out of money if the budget is not in place by May, a fear that may work in the schools' favor by pressing the governor, the speaker and the majority leader to reach a budget agreement earlier than usual.
This year, nearly all school districts must put their budgets before voters on May 20. Under state law, if a budget does not pass, a district can try one more time before having to adopt a contingency budget that limits spending at 1.9 percent more than the current year. Once districts adopt their budgets, they cannot increase spending even if they get a last-minute infusion of state aid. (That money can be used only to offset property tax increases or as surplus for the following year.) 
Spending for schools in the state's five largest cities -- New York, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Yonkers -- is included in the cities' overall budgets and does not have to be approved by the voters. Therefore, it is easier for those cities to incorporate additional state aid, if it becomes available. But the stakes are also much greater for those cities because state aid typically makes up 45 percent to 75 percent of their school spending. This year, more than 43 percent of the proposed $1.2 billion reduction in state education spending would come from those five districts.
"It's quite grim out there," said Steven Van Hoesen, deputy director of the New York State Association of School Business Officials, which was a co-sponsor of the budget workshop at the Albany hotel. "Districts are trying to budget right now, not knowing what the final numbers will be. What are you going to do? The only choice is to look at your education programs -- and figure out where to make cuts."
Rochester and Buffalo schools have discussed adopting a four-day week, and the Buffalo Board of Education has decided to close at least two elementary schools and an alternative high school in June. Syracuse officials said that they were planning to eliminate more than 200 teaching and other staff jobs, nearly 5 percent of their work force, and that they were considering options like lowering the thermostat and holding fewer class days in winter to cut down on heating costs.
Even wealthier suburban districts like Bedford, in Westchester County, are feeling the pinch even though they receive far less state aid than the cities. To offset a $500,000 cut in state aid and higher operating costs, officials of the 4,200-student Bedford district say they are considering laying off seven teaching aides, scaling back a summer academy for struggling students, disbanding five homework clubs and limiting the leasing of technology equipment for classrooms.
"This is the toughest budget I've seen," said Dr. Bruce Dennis, the school superintendent for 11 years. "Of all years, I think this is the one to be cautious. It strikes me that there's little hope on the horizon of an increase."
In the 3,200-student Scotia-Glenville district, about 15 miles northwest of Albany, state aid is expected to drop by $1 million next year. School officials have proposed a 19.5 percent increase in property taxes to maintain existing programs, and as an alternative have outlined a contingency budget that would include laying off 25 teachers and 2 librarians, increasing class sizes and eliminating some athletic teams and bus routes.
The school district has been forced to adopt contingency budgets 3 times in the last 10 years after residents voted against its proposals. 
This year, school officials say, they are expecting opposition not only because of the large increase but also because the local town and county just raisedtheir property taxes.
"It's really hard to sell a budget when they're still reeling from those huge increases," a district spokesman, Robert Hanlon, said. "It all comes out of the same pocket to them. They can take out their frustrations on the schools."
By now, most seasoned school administrators have come up with strategies for coping with the chronic uncertainty of state education money. Dr. Raymond Gerson, executive director of the Lower Hudson Council of School Superintendents, said many districts had learned to build their budgets around a "calculated guesstimate" that assumes more state aid than the governor proposes. 
Dr. Gerson said many of his districts were counting on the Legislature to restore enough money for them to get what they did this year. "I think it's safe to predict that what the governor has proposed will not happen," he said, "and districts want to come up with as realistic a figure as possible."
Increasingly, some districts are unwilling to take that gamble. Many of them were left short-handed when the Legislature adopted a bare-bones budget in 2001 that did not include the increases that they were counting on. "That changed the pattern, so now districts are very skittish about budgeting anything above what the governor proposed," said Mr. Van Hoesen, of the school business association.
The chief financial officer for the Syracuse city schools, Robert Peters, said school officials who were banking on more state aid were "living in la-la land," adding, "There's no silver bullet, there's going to be cuts. We're using the governor's budget number right to the penny, and anything more than that would be fiscally irresponsible."
During the budget workshop this month, Samuel Sanfratello, an assistant superintendent in the 5,600-student Corning-Painted Post Area School District, described his strategy for dealing with this year's financial problems. For the first time, he presented three different budgets to his school board: one based on the governor's proposed cuts, another based on current state aid, and a third that split the difference. 
"They're all so bad that we're still grappling with what we're going to do," he said.
"There's still going to be some dancing in Albany, but there just isn't the money to restore all the cuts, so we'll just have to wait and see what happens."

HEADLINE: Is the Future Older, Smaller and Better? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 You make "Humanity's Slowing Growth" (editorial, March 17) sound like a failure instead of one of the great success stories. 
Yes, more people live into old age, but in the industrialized world, they are healthier, better educated and better off financially than any previous generation. People today are making old "older." 
 The growing number of people over 65 can be a resource rather than an "economic challenge." Societies are capable of updating their notions of retirement age, one-way career ladders and the value of callow youth over experience. That doesn't seem hard compared with the alternative: asking for volunteers to die early to help lower the median age.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 A March 17 editorial mentions my book "The Population Bomb," and its warnings about shortages of resources. In the book, and many later publications, I also discussed the unhappy connections of population growth to the deterioration of our epidemiological environment. 
 I warned of the emergence of plagues like AIDS that could bring a hideous "solution" to the population problem. As larger human populations have closer contact with animal reservoirs of diseases, the odds increase that AIDS will not be the last lethal epidemic. Let's hope that the new Asian pneumonia is not a long-feared deadly flu produced by close contact with swine and fowl.
But surely, with President Bush starting another resource war, you don't really think that America's economic prospects will be "improved" by population growth!

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: NEW YORK; 
A Security Blanket, but With No Guarantees

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA; Randal C. Archibold, Charles V. Bagli, Al Baker, David W. Chen, Nichole M. Christian, Steven Greenhouse, David M. Herszenhorn, Kirk Johnson, Randy Kennedy, David Kocieniewski, Andy Newman, Michelle O'Donnell, Lydia Polgreen, William K. Rashbaum, Susan Sachs, Daniel J. Wakin and Robert F. Worth contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
As the United States wages war on Iraq, New Yorkers and others across the region are witnessing an extraordinary state of heightened security. Police officers are armed like assault troops outside prominent buildings, police boats are combing the waterfronts and trucks are being inspected at bridges and tunnels.
 Some of these unsettling sights and sounds will cease when the war ends. Many will not. In the 18 months since terrorists destroyed the World Trade Center and killed nearly 2,800 people, significant and lasting changes have been made in the region's security landscape. More are in the works. 
 No one can live or work in the region without having noticed the proliferation of armed security guards, surveillance cameras, handbag searches, metal detectors, electronic access cards and bomb-sniffing dogs, all of which have multiplied from Pennsylvania Station to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
Layered atop those are changes hidden from most eyes, like the detectives paying visits to chemical companies that terrorists might contact, the immigration agents demanding credit card numbers from foreign visitors, or the hospital emergency room stockpiles of nerve gas antidotes.
Yet for all the improvements, no assurances have been given, nor would they be believed; Israel offers bloody proof that no degree of vigilance is a guarantee.
Still, this new security blanket has gaping holes. Some come with promised fixes and some do not. Some defy easy repair in an open society and some seem to be waiting for solutions not yet imagined. With the masses of people pouring, unsearched, into subway trains, Times Square and neighborhood multiplexes, it is easy to have thoughts of recent terror attacks in Jerusalem or Moscow.
People and bags arriving at the international airports are much more carefully screened than they were before 9/11, but cargo arriving at the seaports is not.
Power companies have increased security around their plants, but Consolidated Edison rebuffed Police Department recommendations to install vehicle barriers and new fences at a complex in Queens.
Public schools in New York City have been ordered to develop and revise emergency plans, but many have either not done so, or have failed to show the plans to parents, teachers and safety officers.
The Police Department has significantly increased its commitment to counterterrorism work. Yet its force has 4,000 fewer men and women than it did two years ago, and many of the officers and supervisors who would be first to respond to an incident have not yet received any special equipment, like gas masks, or any specialized training for dealing with unconventional weapons.
At the Indian Point nuclear plant in Westchester County, the Entergy Corporation has increased security. But there is no longer an approved plan to evacuate the surrounding communities in an emergency.
And from every sector, public or private, comes the constant lament that security is expensive, but that budgets are very tight in a lagging economy, and that help from Washington has been too limited.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Washington made a fundamental mistake in approving too little security aid last year, and in distributing it so that New York received less than the national average, per capita. But he said that after meeting with President Bush last Wednesday, he was confident that more aid was on the way.
"I think there's no question that training, equipment, focus, awareness -- all of those things are much improved," Mr. Bloomberg said Friday.
There is still considerable room for improvement across the region, he said.
"From a security provider's perspective, there's no downside to having too much," he said. "There's an enormous downside to having too little."

Transportation
Airports and Shipping Apply Stricter Rules
In February, new bomb detection equipment at Kennedy International Airport set off an alarm, sensing nitrates -- a common bomb ingredient -- in the luggage of a group of Muslims returning from their pilgrimage to Mecca. The culprit turned out to be 15 gallons of harmless holy water that happened to contain traces of nitrates.
"That's how sharp our screeners are now," said William R. Hall, security director at the airport for the federal Transportation Security Administration.
After the Sept. 11 attack, no area of American life was subjected to more intense scrutiny than air travel. The federal government shouldered a far larger role, through the Transportation Security Administration, taking over airport security from a group of widely criticized contractors, and imposing tougher rules for screening employees, passengers and luggage.
It has been an expensive undertaking. The powerful car-size X-ray machines being installed at airports to screen baggage cost about $1 million apiece.
The agency's squat beige building at J.F.K. represents the end product of all the tales of confiscated knitting needles. Two storage rooms overflow with passengers' contraband, from chain saws to perfumes with names like "Time Bomb," whose bottles are shaped like explosives. Officials say the number of guns and knives seized at airport checkpoints nationwide has more than tripled since 9/11.
Before 9/11, fewer than 2 percent of checked bags were inspected; now, all are either X-rayed or swabbed for explosive traces, or both. Before 9/11, there were 37 federal marshals assigned to riding airliners undercover; now, there are thousands, according to airport officials.
But while much has changed in airline security, that is not true of the metropolitan area's seaports in Elizabeth, N.J.; on Staten Island; and in Red Hook in Brooklyn. Experts say that seaports remain one of the region's great vulnerabilities.
Only 2 to 3 percent of the millions of truck-size shipping containers arriving in New York Harbor each year are inspected -- just a slight increase from before Sept. 11.
"Over all, if we had to rate this thing from1 to 10, when we started on Sept. 11, we were at a 1 and today we are at a 2," said Stephen E. Flynn, an international shipping authority at the Council on Foreign Relations.
At a congressional hearing in November, Bethann Rooney, manager of port security for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, complained that security efforts were fragmented, with no one in charge.
Most plans for shipping security are far from fruition, because of limited resources. Ship owners are required to notify the Customs Service of all United States-bound cargo 24 hours before it is loaded, to give officers time to determine which containers should be inspected, and Customs officers are now posted in a few foreign ports. But so far, with its small force, the service has set up shop in only 10 ports in Europe, Canada and Asia.
Customs and the Coast Guard are exploring the idea of inspecting more containers, and interdicting cargo, in certain cases, while it is still more than 100 miles out at sea. But that would require more people, more ships and the agreement of other nations. Despite having some assets called to war in the Middle East, the Coast Guard now has about 8 to 12 more vessels patrolling in the region than it did before or after 9/11.
Some officials advocate technological fixes that in some cases have not been fully developed or put in place, like crane-mounted radiation detectors, and "smart boxes" attached to shipping containers that would detect tampering and weapons. But the federal government has shown little appetite for investing in that area.
Closer to home for most New Yorkers, the region's sprawling web of subways, buses, commuter trains, bridges and tunnels remains an obvious target. There are hundreds more police officers -- and, at times, National Guard troops -- patrolling places like Grand Central Terminal and the Lincoln Tunnel than before Sept. 11, and they routinely use bomb-sniffing dogs.
But the system is porous by definition, and officials say there is no practical way to change that. Attempts are being made to harden it, with measures like electronic access cards for vulnerable areas, but ambitious steps, like a network of video cameras in subway stations, remain mostly talk.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Port Authority have earmarked $1.1 billion for security improvements, but that has meant taking money from other projects, like new signals for PATH trains.
Before the trade center attack, said Peter S. Kalikow, the M.T.A. chairman, planning dealt with blizzards and pickpockets. In tackling the terrorist threat, he said, "we had to literally turn on a dime."

Preparedness
Plans and Tactics Revised for Response
The New York Fire Department, the Office of Emergency Management and the Police Department all suffered heavy losses in the trade center attack, forcing them to do a great deal of rebuilding and rethinking.
That has meant new facilities, new equipment and new training. More fundamentally, it has forced changes in emergency planning and tactics. Among the basic lessons of 9/11, two stand out: the agencies tended to put too many resources in a single place; and, in a crisis, communications and chains of command were vulnerable to breakdowns.
Despite the advances they have made, there are still problem areas.
Every firefighter is equipped with a new digital radio, replacing the radios that proved so flawed on Sept. 11. The department plans a system of "repeaters" throughout the city to help its radio signals penetrate skyscraper walls. But so far, the police and firefighters still do not have a shared radio frequency, relying on commanders for communication and coordination -- a system that has failed before.
The Fire Department has cached emergency supplies, wrapped in plastic, in secret locations throughout the city.
The department lost 343 people at the trade center, including many of its top brass and elite specialists. Since then, it has changed its practices -- to keep more of its commanders away from major incidents, and to set up command posts farther from the action.
In the event of major losses in the command structure, 35 top officials have been trained to run the department in rotating shifts, and the department plans to give such training to another 35.
The city's Office of Emergency Management lost its command post at 7 World Trade Center, and while operating out of a temporary center near the Brooklyn Bridge, it is building a new post at Cadman Plaza East in Brooklyn -- a much less prominent location. Looking at the city's experience, New York State is building up its backup emergency command posts statewide.
Officials say that while coordination among city agencies is somewhat improved, a major weakness remains: there is no formal "incident command," a uniform system for putting a single agency in charge at an emergency, depending on the type of incident, so that agencies do not fall to squabbling or working at cross purposes. Proposed policies over the years have met with resistance from the Police and Fire Departments, each unwilling to cede control.
At both the Police and Fire Departments, the unions and many of the rank and file say they are inadequately prepared to deal with a new world of threats that includes large explosions, radiation, chemical weapons and biological hazards.
The Fire Department has one highly specialized hazardous materials unit whose members have more than 300 hours of training -- a consultant's report after the trade center attack said there should be a second -- and a dozen units with hazardous materials technicians, each with more than 80 hours of training.
But firefighters with the remaining ladder and rescue companies have little preparation of that kind. The department has begun giving a 24-hour course on hazardous materials and a 16-hour course on terrorism, but only firefighters hired since Sept. 11 have taken them.
"We have to make sure the rescuers don't need to be rescued," said Philip McArdle, health and safety officer at the Uniformed Firefighters Association.
The police unions note that except for certain elite units, most officers have received no specialized training in dealing with unconventional weapons. To date, less than one-third of the department's officers have received protective gear like gas masks.
A fatalism has taken hold among many firefighters, who say they expect that many of them would die in an unconventional attack. The officers of one Manhattan fire company have drafted their own contingency plan, saying that in a biological or chemical attack in a subway, unless ordered underground by a chief, firefighters would not enter the subway until they first saw live victims emerging.
Officials in both departments acknowledge the training gap, and said the city's money woes were to blame. With the city facing a $4 billion budget gap, police and firefighters are doing more with less -- taking on new security duties while the departments are shrinking.
Added training, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said, means pulling officers away from their regular jobs, and paying overtime for someone else to fill in. He has asked for $261 million in federal aid, much of it for training.
Similarly, Chief Frank Cruthers said the Fire Department would like to provide more training, but did not have the money. "This is an overtime issue," he said.

Enforcement
Intelligence Gathering Is a Police Priority
On Sept. 11, 2001, the New York Police Department had about 20 people assigned to counterterrorism. Today, it has almost 1,000.
To an extraordinary degree, the department has transformed itself in just a year and half into a force that works around the globe to thwart people who might be taking aim at New York -- a profound change in mission and mind-set.
The department has hired former Central Intelligence Agency and military experts, increased sixfold the number of people assigned to a joint terrorism task force with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and posted detectives overseas to work and train with foreign law enforcement agencies. At home, the routine duties of the Police Department have been expanded to include conducting truck checkpoints, scanning vehicles with hand-held radiation detectors, and visiting businesses like chemical companies that terrorists may have contacted.
The harbor patrol in their boats and the heavily armed "Hercules" teams in their armored sport-utility vehicles constantly roam the city in unpredictable patterns. And both forces can regularly be seen at landmarks considered potential targets.
Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, said last week that New York's efforts have been "a model for other communities to follow."
New Jersey's early efforts to enter the counterterrorism field met with several setbacks. Gov. James E. McGreevey's first choice to head the effort was an Israeli citizen, ineligible for F.B.I. briefings, and he withdrew under criticism.
New Jersey is assembling a terrorism task force, but at a planned strength of 70 people, it will be quite small by New York's standards. The state has provided specialized training to local police departments, and officials say they have quietly developed a program to identify and monitor several dozen immigrants believed to be sympathetic to groups like Al Qaeda and Hamas.
Since 9/11, New York State Police and National Guard forces have helped patrol New York City, and about 500 guard troops remain in the city, but those agencies, too, have been stretched thin.
State troopers have been assigned to checkpoints along the Canadian border, a job that they did not perform before the attack. Superintendent James W. McMahon, commander of the force, said that troopers were available to cover all 12 international crossings where Customs and Border Patrol officers were already posted, and that 120 troopers had been assigned to patrol and periodically check the unmanned crossings.
Other troopers have been shifted to the State Capitol in Albany for security reasons. That has contributed to concern among union leaders that there have been fewer troopers performing duties like patrolling highways in the capital region.
"The front line in the war on terrorism is the road, the officer, his eyes and ears, to say, 'What is not right here?' " said Dan De Federicis, president of the Police Benevolent Association of the New York State Troopers.
Through a federal grant, the state is acquiring 113 mobile trailers with equipment to detect hazardous materials, including protective suits. But other technical advances that state officials proposed more than a year ago have been slow in coming. State troopers' radios still cannot communicate with those of New York City officers orfederal agents, and a trooper shadowing a suspicious car on a highway still has no way to tap into federal terrorism databases.
In the field of immigration control, law enforcement and intelligence gathering have changed markedly since Sept. 11. Immigration agents, now part of Homeland Security, and the F.B.I., with the help of local law enforcement, are tracking and deporting more than 300,000 aliens who remained in the United States despite deportation orders.
Schools are now being required to report all foreign students to the federal government -- some 9,000 just at Columbia University and New York University.
Visitors and immigrants from mostly Muslim nations are being subjected to far greater scrutiny than in the past. Male travelers from 26 nations are now fingerprinted and photographed upon arrival. And men from a long list of Muslim countries who are already in the United States are being required to register with the government -- a process that immigration lawyers say means not only supplying an address and fingerprints, but also credit card numbers, video rental subscription numbers, family members' addresses and e-mail addresses.

Health
Hospitals Invest In Being Ready
Outside Bellevue Hospital Center's emergency room, pre-9/11 readiness and its post-9/11 evolution stand a few yards apart.
On one side is an old, portable decontamination shower, exposed to the elements, with room for a handful of people, hooked up to a hose. On the other is an enclosed, permanent, recently completed $500,000 structure with air filters, 56 high-speed water nozzles and the ability to decontaminate as many as 500 people an hour.
At St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital in Greenwich Village, the pharmacy has a stockpile of 350 injection kits loaded with atropine, an antidote for some nerve gases, and more than 100 with a cyanide antidote. "Before 9/11, we wouldn't even have thought about carrying atropine kits, and we had maybe 5 or 10 for cyanide," said Dr. Richard Westphal, director of emergency medicine.
Hospitals have invested heavily in preparation for an attack, perhaps more than any other business. According to the Greater New York Hospital Association, hospitals across the state have spent more than $200 million on security and emergency response measures that were not contemplated before the trade center attack, and have plans to spend more than that over the next year. Hospitals in the city have spent far more than those in the suburbs or upstate, and the trauma centers have done the most of all.
They have built "negative air pressure" rooms that germs cannot escape, bought body suits and respirators and installed backup computer systems. New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation bought a radio system linking its 11 hospitals, in case the phones go dead.
And, of course, most hospitals, like the city and state, are taking part in the national effort to vaccinate thousands of health care workers against smallpox.
To compensate for all of this, Washington has sent New York's hospitals an extra $8 million, or a maximum of $40,000 per hospital -- less than many hospitals say they will spend on the vaccination program alone.
"We've had to absorb most of the costs," said Dr. Van H. Dunn, senior vice president and chief medical officer of the hospitals corporation. "We had hoped for more."
Readiness varies greatly among the ambulances that answer emergency calls in New York City -- a system split between the Fire Department's Emergency Medical Service and private ambulance corps, and run mostly by hospitals.
St. Vincent's ambulances have all been equipped with gas masks and body suits to protect the paramedics, and with antidotes to chemical agents. Emergency Medical Service crews have received masks, but except for 10 ambulances designated to respond to hazardous materials incidents, they do not have body suits or antidotes. Most of the private ambulance crews head into the field with none of that equipment.
Public health agencies have developed systems that they hope will detect outbreaks of disease faster in New York City, whether natural or manufactured. The city this year became the first site of a federal program testing air samples for various pathogens.
The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has built what it calls a "syndromic surveillance system," collecting information on thousands of 911 calls, emergency room trips and pharmacy visits daily, and analyzing them for patterns.
The city and state health departments are expanding and modernizing their laboratories, which were overwhelmed during the anthrax scare when they were required to test everything from letters to furniture. Each wants to do more, but might be stalled by money. The state's hopes for a new, more sophisticated lab in Rome, N.Y., are contingent on gaining a $150 million federal grant.
Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the city health commissioner, said his department had spent $13 million on upgrading the lab. An additional $45 million in further changes are planned. "But we don't know where the money's going to come from," he said.
When the anthrax-laced letters were mailed in New Jersey, that state found itself ill-equipped, and was widely criticized for its muddled response. Since then, New Jersey has formed a bioterrorism rapid-response team, and Governor McGreevey says his state is seeking $150 million from Washington for a new health lab.

Landmarks
A Need to Guard The Infrastructure
Since 9/11, lunch deliveries inside the New York Stock Exchange have been forbidden. On Wall Street, there is a palpable sense of being a target. And though most securities firms refuse to discuss specifics, changes are visible in the form of legions of guards and thorough checks of people entering buildings.
The financial industry has taken steps not only to deter attacks, but also to make sure that it can continue running in the event of a catastrophe. The New York Stock Exchange now has a backup site in another borough -- it will not say where -- that it says could be put into operation within a day, and the Nasdaq, the American Stock Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange have also developed alternative trading floors.
Many big banks and investment firms have set up relocation offices and backup data centers outside New York City. Morgan Stanley altered its plan to concentrate operations in three Times Square towers, instead moving some offices north of the city. Recently, a Securities Industry Association survey found that 20 of 57 big financial industry companies had relocation offices more than 30 miles from headquarters.
But security preparations have been spotty among the thousands of places where people across the region live, work and study, or that they rely on for daily services.
Utilities have hired more guards and built new fences, but they remain vulnerable, according to some experts and public officials. Federal regulators plan to issue tougher rules for nuclear plant security soon, but there are no federal or state regulations for security at other utility plants.
Last year, Con Edison ruled out as too costly or impractical some security improvements the Police Department recommended for a power complex in western Queens, like barriers that would stop vehicles, and new fences along the East River.
This month, a truck driven by a television news crew drove past the fence at the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station in Forked River, N.J., and pulled up to a loading dock, unchallenged, even as state officials were conducting a public relations campaign to ease public jitters about security. "State and federal officials have promised us that every possible safeguard has been out in place to safeguard against such an attack," said State Senator Leonard T. Connors Jr., a Republican from Forked River. "Then a vehicle gains access to the plant, drives around unhindered, and could have been loaded with explosives."
New York City's Department of Environmental Protection has spent $100 million on enhanced security, with another $100 million planned, for the system of reservoirs and aqueducts, upstate and in Westchester County, that supplies water to the city.
The department says that contamination is not a real threat because the network is vast enough to dilute any chemicals or germs. And though there is increased surveillance upstate, the department admits that it cannot police the entire system. Rather, the department says the danger is of disruption, like terrorists blowing up water tunnels, and the new security has been concentrated in those areas.
The Postal Service, hit hard by the anthrax letters, has begun to use machines that can detect pathogens on letters and packages, and plans to have them in 282 centers nationally within several years. The first 15 such machines are scheduled to be in place by next month in sorting centers across the country, but only one in the New York metropolitan area, in Edison, N.J.
Postal officials said they also had plans for installing new air-filtering systems at postal centers, as well as a new machine at Kennedy Airport to detect radioactive materials arriving in mail from overseas.
Public schools were all supposed to have redrafted their emergency plans since 9/11, but compliance has been uneven. Jamaica High School in Queens posted its new plan on its Web site; Stuyvesant High School, four blocks from where the trade center's twin towers stood, has not finished drafting one.
Teamsters Local 237, representing New York City school safety officers, said it surveyed those officers and found that 68 percent had not been informed of their schools' plans. "As well-intentioned as the emergency plan is, it is not getting down to the people that would execute the plan," said Carl E. Haynes, the union president. The teachers' union has made similar complaints.
Security is far more visible at most government buildings throughout the region, and at structures, public and private, that are internationally known icons.
Access to the Empire State Building is more controlled now, and the building's managers say they have added $6 million a year worth of security measures.
At Yankee Stadium, there are far more police officers and private security guards during games. Bags and backpacks are forbidden, trash cans and parking have been eliminated along the perimeter wall, and there are more security cameras.
At some places, like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Statue of Liberty, officials would not discuss security. But at many private commercial and residential buildings, the approach has been, as one security consultant put it, "laughable."
In New Jersey, state officials developed a list of the 110 privately owned sites they considered most likely to become targets, from office buildings to chemical plants, and even allocated $46 million to help pay for security. But they admit it has been slow going, and Sidney J. Caspersen, the state's director of counterterrorism, said more federal aid was needed.
Michael G. Cherkasky, president of Kroll Associates, an international security firm, said tough economic times had meant fewer precautions. "Companies are less willing to spend dollars on virtually everything, and that includes security," he said.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
For Upgrading, Get a Calculator Upgrades

BYLINE:  By SUSAN STELLIN; SUSAN STELLIN is a frequent contributor to the Travel section.

 BODY:
IN a United Airlines announcement last summer detailing a number of changes it was making to cut costs -- including new policies for its upgrade program -- a United senior vice president, Chris Bowers, was quoted as saying, "Consistently, we receive feedback from our best customers that upgrades are too complex and not simple to use." 
 The same could be said today of United and its competitors: unraveling the carriers' various options, rules and exceptions for upgrading to a seat in the front cabin is still a head-spinning endeavor. 
 Although upgrade rules have never been particularly straightforward, the options have gotten even more complex in the last year as the airlines have added more restrictions to their existing upgrade policies and in many cases increased the cost of upgrading. Further complicating matters, several carriers have begun migrating to automated "e-upgrade" programs, adding another layer to the options passengers must decipher when weighing whether to spring for a first-class ticket or try to upgrade from coach. 
Indeed, with the cuts some airlines have made recently to business- and first-class fares, those who follow the industry say passengers considering an upgrade should first research what it would cost to simply buy a business- or first-class ticket. 
"It's a little-known trend that discounted business-class fares are becoming very inexpensive," said Matthew J. Bennett, publisher of Firstclassflyer.com, which offers free advice and a newsletter with tips on ways to fly up front. 

Three Ways Up
For those interested in upgrading, there are typically three ways to get out of coach: qualify for a free upgrade, use frequent flier miles to upgrade to a higher class of service, or purchase an upgrade -- usually by buying upgrade coupons from an airline that offers such a program. 
In all three cases, the rules vary by airline, but with all of these methods, the most important thing to keep in mind is that the cheapest tickets are generally not upgradable. Also, upgrades are typically granted based on your frequent flier status, so an airline's elite customers are usually given the chance to upgrade before everyone else. 
As for free upgrades, most of the major United States airlines still offer them to either elite-level frequent fliers or passengers traveling on full-fare economy tickets (sometimes you have to meet both criteria). These upgrades are generally based on availability and are usually confirmed shortly before travel. 
For example, American, Northwest and Continental will upgrade their elite customers free on most domestic routes if seats are available, though typically you have to be traveling on a more expensive full-fare ticket to get one of these free bumps. US Airways gives free upgrades to passengers traveling on full-fare coach tickets to domestic and some international destinations, while United and Delta reward some elite customers with free e-upgrade or paper certificates based on mileage flown. 

Using Your Miles
For those who aren't elite fliers or don't pay top dollar for a ticket, using miles to upgrade is another option. But here's the catch: even if you are using miles to upgrade, some carriers will only let you do so if you are traveling on an eligible, usually higher, fare. 
"I see a lot of people who are on a $99 fare and then they're upset to find out they can't upgrade," Mr. Bennett said, which is why he recommends asking if you can use miles to upgrade a particular fare before you buy your ticket. For international travel, he also suggests making sure you are allowed to use miles to upgrade if you are purchasing a ticket that includes travel on an airline's code share partner. 
How many miles you need for an upgrade depends on the price of your ticket and the airline you are flying. On US Airways, for example, you need 10,000 miles to upgrade a round-trip domestic ticket if you have bought a full-fare or nonrestricted ticket, but 20,000 miles for most economy fares. But United requires 16,000 miles to upgrade a round-trip, full-fare domestic ticket and 30,000 miles for most economy fares. With some airlines, certain discount coach fares cannot be upgraded using miles at all. 
The carriers will usually confirm an upgrade using frequent flier miles when you buy your ticket, but upgrades are based on availability and in some cases, an airline won't release seats for an upgrade until shortly before a flight. 
Dr. Marilyn Seide, an administrator for the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health, had that experience with Continental last summer, when she spent more than $1,000 on a coach ticket from Los Angeles to Amsterdam so she could use miles to upgrade because she had just had hip surgery. But then Dr. Seide found out the airline would not clear seats for an upgrade until 72 hours before the flight. Ultimately, she had to buy a new ticket for $1,950, almost double the original price, and use 80,000 miles to get the upgrade. 
Following the trend toward more automated transactions in the airline industry, American, US Airways, United and Delta have all introduced some type of program allowing customers to upgrade without dealing with an airline agent -- on the Web or at a computer kiosk at an airport. 
Ultimately, the carriers hope to streamline the upgrade process by letting customers purchase, earn or trade miles for electronic "coupons," then rely on computers to award customers upgrades depending on how much they paid for their ticket and their frequent flier status. But in the meantime, these programs have added another layer of complexity to an already dizzying array of rules. 
Although details of the programs vary, the e-upgrade coupons typically come in 500-mile segments, so you might have to use four coupons for a 1,700-mile flight. If you buy coupons, they generally cost $50 each, meaning a round-trip cross-country upgrade (about 6,000 miles) would cost 12 coupons or $600. Sometimes, discounts are available to elite fliers, customers who buy the coupons online or buy in bulk. 
Some carriers also offer customers the option to trade miles for e-upgrades, but for now, you can usually get more value for your miles -- and earlier confirmation of your upgrade -- through the airlines' regular frequent flier programs. But this might not always be a deal. For instance, United requires 50,000 miles for eight e-upgrades -- not enough coupons to upgrade a round-trip ticket from Los Angeles to New York -- while you could upgrade that ticket using 30,000 frequent flier miles. 
But before you trade miles or cash for any of these programs, read the fine print. E-upgrades cannot be used on some international routes or with all fares, and in some cases the e-upgrades expire after a year. 
Finally, no matter what upgrade method you are considering, research your options before buying a ticket. Mr. Bennett said: 
"People call us and they say, 'I've got this ticket; how do I upgrade?' After you've purchased a ticket, you're at the mercy of that particular flight being available."

HEADLINE: The Philosopher of Islamic Terror

 BODY:
I. In the days after Sept. 11, 2001, many people anticipated a quick and satisfying American victory over Al Qaeda. The terrorist army was thought to be no bigger than a pirate ship, and the newly vigilant police forces of the entire world were going to sink the ship with swift arrests and dark maneuvers. Al Qaeda was driven from its bases in Afghanistan. Arrests and maneuvers duly occurred and are still occurring. Just this month, one of Osama bin Laden's top lieutenants was nabbed in Pakistan. Police agents, as I write, seem to be hot on the trail of bin Laden himself, or so reports suggest.
 Yet Al Qaeda has seemed unfazed. Its popularity, which was hard to imagine at first, has turned out to be large and genuine in more than a few countries. Al Qaeda upholds a paranoid and apocalyptic worldview, according to which "Crusaders and Zionists" have been conspiring for centuries to destroy Islam. And this worldview turns out to be widely accepted in many places -- a worldview that allowed many millions of people to regard the Sept. 11 attacks as an Israeli conspiracy, or perhaps a C.I.A. conspiracy, to undo Islam. Bin Laden's soulful, bearded face peers out from T-shirts and posters in a number of countries, quite as if he were the new Che Guevara, the mythic righter of cosmic wrongs. 
 The vigilant police in many countries, applying themselves at last, have raided a number of Muslim charities and Islamic banks, which stand accused of subsidizing the terrorists. These raids have advanced the war on still another front, which has been good to see. But the raids have also shown that Al Qaeda is not only popular; it is also institutionally solid, with a worldwide network of clandestine resources. This is not the Symbionese Liberation Army. This is an organization with ties to the ruling elites in a number of countries; an organization that, were it given the chance to strike up an alliance with Saddam Hussein's Baath movement, would be doubly terrifying; an organization that, in any case, will surely survive the outcome in Iraq. 
To anyone who has looked closely enough, Al Qaeda and its sister organizations plainly enjoy yet another strength, arguably the greatest strength of all, something truly imposing -- though in the Western press this final strength has received very little attention. Bin Laden is a Saudi plutocrat with Yemeni ancestors, and most of the suicide warriors of Sept. 11 were likewise Saudis, and the provenance of those people has focused everyone's attention on the Arabian peninsula. But Al Qaeda has broader roots. The organization was created in the late 1980's by an affiliation of three armed factions -- bin Laden's circle of "Afghan" Arabs, together with two factions from Egypt, the Islamic Group and Egyptian Islamic Jihad, the latter led by Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, Al Qaeda's top theoretician. The Egyptian factions emerged from an older current, a school of thought from within Egypt's fundamentalist movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, in the 1950's and 60's. And at the heart of that single school of thought stood, until his execution in 1966, a philosopher named Sayyid Qutb -- the intellectual hero of every one of the groups that eventually went into Al Qaeda, their Karl Marx (to put it that way), their guide. 
Qutb (pronounced KUH-tahb) wrote a book called "Milestones," and that book was cited at his trial, which gave it immense publicity, especially after its author was hanged. "Milestones" became a classic manifesto of the terrorist wing of Islamic fundamentalism. A number of journalists have dutifully turned the pages of "Milestones," trying to decipher the otherwise inscrutable terrorist point of view. 
I have been reading some of Qutb's other books, and I think that "Milestones" may have misled the journalists. "Milestones" is a fairly shallow book, judged in isolation. But "Milestones" was drawn from his vast commentary on the Koran called "In the Shade of the Qur'an." One of the many volumes of this giant work was translated into English in the 1970's and published by the World Assembly of Muslim Youth, an organization later widely suspected of participation interrorist attacks -- and an organization whose Washington office was run by a brother of bin Laden's. In the last four years a big effort has been mounted by another organization, the Islamic Foundation in England, to bring out the rest, in what will eventually be an edition of 15 fat English-language volumes, handsomely ornamented with Arabic script from the Koran. Just in these past few weeks a number of new volumes in this edition have made their way into the Arab bookshops of Brooklyn, and I have gobbled them up. By now I have made my way through a little less than half of "In the Shade of the Qur'an," which I think is all that exists so far in English, together with three other books by Qutb. And I have something to report.
Qutb is not shallow. Qutb is deep. "In the Shade of the Qur'an" is, in its fashion, a masterwork. Al Qaeda and its sister organizations are not merely popular, wealthy, global, well connected and institutionally sophisticated. These groups stand on a set of ideas too, and some of those ideas may be pathological, which is an old story in modern politics; yet even so, the ideas are powerful. We should have known that, of course. But we should have known many things.

II. Qutb's special ability as a writer came from the fact that, as a young boy, he received a traditional Muslim education -- he committed the Koran to memory by the age of 10 -- yet he went on, at a college in Cairo, to receive a modern, secular education. He was born in 1906, and in the 1920's and 30's he took up socialism and literature. He wrote novels, poems and a book that is still said to be well regarded called "Literary Criticism: Its Principles and Methodology." His writings reflected -- here I quote one of his admirers and translators, Hamid Algar of the University of California at Berkeley -- a "Western-tinged outlook on cultural and literary questions." Qutb displayed "traces of individualism and existentialism." He even traveled to the United States in the late 1940's, enrolled at the Colorado State College of Education and earned a master's degree. In some of the accounts of Qutb's life, this trip to America is pictured as a ghastly trauma, mostly because of America's sexual freedoms, which sent him reeling back to Egypt in a mood of hatred and fear.
I am skeptical of that interpretation, though. His book from the 1940's, "Social Justice and Islam," shows that, even before his voyage to America, he was pretty well set in his Islamic fundamentalism. It is true that, after his return to Egypt, he veered into ever more radical directions. But in the early 1950's, everyone in Egypt was veering in radical directions. Gamal Abdel Nasser and a group of nationalist army officers overthrew the old king in 1952 and launched a nationalist revolution on Pan-Arabist grounds. And, as the Pan-Arabists went about promoting their revolution, Sayyid Qutb went about promoting his own, somewhat different revolution. His idea was "Islamist." He wanted to turn Islam into a political movement to create a new society, to be based on ancient Koranic principles. Qutb joined the Muslim Brotherhood, became the editor of its journal and established himself right away as Islamism's principal theoretician in the Arab world.
The Islamists and the Pan-Arabists tried to cooperate with one another in Egypt in those days, and there was some basis for doing so. Both movements dreamed of rescuing the Arab world from the legacies of European imperialism. Both groups dreamed of crushing Zionism and the brand-new Jewish state. Both groups dreamed of fashioning a new kind of modernity, which was not going to be liberal and freethinking in the Western style but, even so, was going to be up-to-date on economic and scientific issues. And both movements dreamed of doing all this by returning in some fashion to the glories of the Arab past. Both movements wanted to resurrect, in a modern version, the ancient Islamic caliphate of the seventh century, when the Arabs were conquering the world. 
The Islamists and the Pan-Arabists could be compared, in these ambitions, with the Italian Fascists of Mussolini's time, who wanted to resurrect the Roman Empire, and to the Nazis, who likewise wanted to resurrect ancient Rome, except in a German version. The most radical of the Pan-Arabists openly admired the Nazis and pictured their proposed new caliphate as a racial victory of the Arabs over all other ethnic groups. Qutb and the Islamists, by way of contrast, pictured the resurrected caliphate as a theocracy, strictly enforcing shariah, the legal code of the Koran. The Islamists and the Pan-Arabists had their similarities then, and their differences. (And today those two movements still have their similarities and differences -- as shown by bin Laden's Qaeda, which represents the most violent wing of Islamism, and Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, which represents the most violent wing of Pan-Arabism.) 
In 1952, in the days before staging his coup d'etat, Colonel Nasser is said to have paid a visit to Qutb at his home, presumably to get his backing. Some people expected that, after taking power, Nasser would appoint Qutb to be the new revolutionary minister of education. But once the Pan-Arabists had thrown out the old king, the differences between the two movements began to overwhelm the similarities, and Qutb was not appointed. Instead, Nasser cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood, and after someone tried to assassinate him, he blamed the Brotherhood and cracked down even harder. Some of the Muslim Brotherhood's most distinguished intellectuals and theologians escaped into exile. Sayyid Qutb's brother, Muhammad Qutb, was one of those people. He fled to Saudi Arabia and ended up as a distinguished Saudi professor of Islamic Studies. Many years later, Osama bin Laden would be one of Muhammad Qutb's students.
But Sayyid Qutb stayed put and paid dearly for his stubbornness. Nasser jailed him in 1954, briefly released him, jailed him again for 10 years, released him for a few months and finally hanged him in 1966. Conditions during the first years of prison were especially bad. Qutb was tortured. Even in better times, according to his followers, he was locked in a ward with 40 people, most of them criminals, with a tape recorder broadcasting the speeches of Nasser 20 hours a day. Still, by smuggling papers in and out of jail, he managed to continue with his writings, no longer in the "Western tinged" vein of his early, literary days but now as a full-fledged Islamist revolutionary. And somehow, he produced his "In the Shade of the Qur'an," this gigantic study, which must surely count as one of the most remarkable works of prison literature ever produced.
Readers without a Muslim education who try to make their way unaided through the Koran tend to find it, as I have, a little dry and forbidding. But Qutb's commentaries are not at all like that. He quotes passages from the chapters, or suras, of the Koran, and he pores over the quoted passages, observing the prosodic qualities of the text, the rhythm, tone and musicality of the words, sometimes the images. The suras lead him to discuss dietary regulations, the proper direction to pray, the rules of divorce, the question of when a man may propose marriage to a widow (four months and 10 days after the death of her husband, unless she is pregnant, in which case after delivery), the rules concerning a Muslim man who wishes to marry a Christian or a Jew (very complicated), the obligations of charity, the punishment for crimes and for breaking your word, the prohibition on liquor and intoxicants, the proper clothing to wear, the rules on usury, moneylending and a thousand other themes.
The Koran tells stories, and Qutb recounts some of these and remarks on their wisdom and significance. His tone is always lucid and plain. Yet the total effect of his writing is almost sensual in its measured pace. The very title "In the Shade of the Qur'an" conveys a vivid desert image, as if the Koran were a leafy palm tree, and we have only to open Qutb's pages to escape the hot sun and refresh ourselves in the shade. As he makes his way through the suras and proposes his other commentaries, he slowly constructs an enormous theological criticism of modern life, and not just in Egypt.

III. Qutb wrote that, all over the world, humans had reached a moment of unbearable crisis. The human race had lost touch with human nature. Man's inspiration, intelligence and morality were degenerating. Sexual relations were deteriorating "to a level lower than the beasts." Man was miserable, anxious and skeptical, sinking into idiocy, insanity and crime. People were turning, in their unhappiness, to drugs, alcohol and existentialism. Qutb admired economic productivity and scientific knowledge. But he did not think that wealth and science were rescuing the human race. He figured that, on the contrary, the richest countries were the unhappiest of all. And what was the cause of this unhappiness -- this wretched split between man's truest nature and modern life?
A great many cultural critics in Europe and America asked this question in the middle years of the 20th century, and a great many of them, following Nietzsche and other philosophers, pointed to the origins of Western civilization in ancient Greece, where man was said to have made his fatal error. This error was philosophical. It consisted of placing an arrogant and deluded faith in the power of human reason -- an arrogant faith that, after many centuries, had created in modern times a tyranny of technology over life.
Qutb shared that analysis, somewhat. Only instead of locating the error in ancient Greece, he located it in ancient Jerusalem. In the Muslim fashion, Qutb looked on the teachings of Judaism as being divinely revealed by God to Moses and the other prophets. Judaism instructed man to worship one God and to forswear all others. Judaism instructed man on how to behave in every sphere of life -- how to live a worldly existence that was also a life at one with God. This could be done by obeying a system of divinely mandated laws, the code of Moses. In Qutb's view, however, Judaism withered into what he called "a system of rigid and lifeless ritual." 
God sent another prophet, though. That prophet, in Qutb's Muslim way of thinking, was Jesus, who proposed a few useful reforms -- lifting some no-longer necessary restrictions in the Jewish dietary code, for example -- and also an admirable new spirituality. But something terrible occurred. The relation between Jesus' followers and the Jews took, in Qutb's view, "a deplorable course." Jesus' followers squabbled with the old-line Jews, and amid the mutual recriminations, Jesus' message ended up being diluted and even perverted. Jesus' disciples and followers were persecuted, which meant that, in their sufferings, the disciples were never able to provide an adequate or systematic exposition of Jesus' message. 
Who but Sayyid Qutb, from his miserable prison in Nasser's Egypt, could have zeroed in so plausibly on the difficulties encountered by Jesus' disciples in getting out the word? Qutb figured that, as a result, the Christian Gospels were badly garbled, and should not be regarded as accurate or reliable. The Gospels declared Jesus to be divine, but in Qutb's Muslim account, Jesus was a mere human -- a prophet of God, not a messiah. The larger catastrophe, however, was this: Jesus' disciples, owing to what Qutb called "this unpleasant separation of the two parties," went too far in rejecting the Jewish teachings.
Jesus' disciples and followers, the Christians, emphasized Jesus' divine message of spirituality and love. But they rejected Judaism's legal system, the code of Moses, which regulated every jot and tittle of daily life. Instead, the early Christians imported into Christianity the philosophy of the Greeks -- the belief in a spiritual existence completely separate from physical life, a zone of pure spirit.
In the fourth century of the Christian era, Emperor Constantine converted the Roman Empire to Christianity. But Constantine, in Qutb's interpretation, did this in a spirit of pagan hypocrisy, dominated by scenes of wantonness, half-naked girls, gems and precious metals. Christianity, having abandoned the Mosaic code, could put up no defense. And so, in their horror at Roman morals, the Christians did as best they could and countered the imperial debaucheries with a cult of monastic asceticism. 
But this was no good at all. Monastic asceticism stands at odds with the physical quality of human nature. In this manner, in Qutb's view, Christianity lost touch with the physical world. The old code of Moses, with its laws for diet, dress, marriage, sex and everything else, had enfolded the divine and the worldly into a single concept, which was the worship of God. But Christianity divided these things into two, the sacred and the secular. Christianity said, "Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto God what is God's." Christianity put the physical world in one corner and the spiritual world in another corner: Constantine's debauches over here, monastic renunciation over there. In Qutb's view there was a "hideous schizophrenia" in this approach to life. And things got worse.
A series of Christian religious councils adopted what Qutb thought to be irrational principles on Christianity's behalf -- principles regarding the nature of Jesus, the Eucharist, transubstantiation and other questions, all of which were, in Qutb's view, "absolutely incomprehensible, inconceivable and incredible." Church teachings froze the irrational principles into dogma. And then the ultimate crisis struck. 

IV. Qutb's story now shifts to Arabia. In the seventh century, God delivered a new revelation to his prophet Muhammad, who established the correct, nondistorted relation to human nature that had always eluded the Christians. Muhammad dictated a strict new legal code, which put religion once more at ease in the physical world, except in a better way than ever before. Muhammad's prophecies, in the Koran, instructed man to be God's "vice regent" on earth -- to take charge of the physical world, and not simply to see it as something alien to spirituality or as a way station on the road to a Christian afterlife. Muslim scientists in the Middle Ages took this instruction seriously and went about inquiring into the nature of physical reality. And, in the Islamic universities of Andalusia and the East, the Muslim scientists, deepening their inquiry, hit upon the inductive or scientific method -- which opened the door to all further scientific and technological progress. In this and many other ways, Islam seized the leadership of mankind. Unfortunately, the Muslims came under attack from Crusaders, Mongols and other enemies. And, because the Muslims proved not faithful enough to Muhammad's revelations, they were unable to fend off these attacks. They were unable to capitalize on their brilliant discovery of the scientific method.
The Muslim discoveries were exported instead into Christian Europe. And there, in Europe in the 16th century, Islam's scientific method began to generate results, and modern science emerged. But Christianity, with its insistence on putting the physical world and the spiritual world in different corners, could not cope with scientific progress. And so Christianity's inability to acknowledge or respect the physical quality of daily life spread into the realm of culture and shaped society's attitude toward science. 
As Qutb saw it, Europeans, under Christianity's influence, began to picture God on one side and science on the other. Religion over here; intellectual inquiry over there. On one side, the natural human yearning for God and for a divinely ordered life; on the other side, the natural human desire for knowledge of the physical universe. The church against science; the scientists against the church. Everything that Islam knew to be one, the Christian Church divided into two. And, under these terrible pressures, the European mind split finally asunder. The break became total. Christianity, over here; atheism, over there. It was the fateful divorce between the sacred and the secular.
Europe's scientific and technical achievements allowed the Europeans to dominate the world. And the Europeans inflicted their "hideous schizophrenia" on peoples and cultures in every corner of the globe. That was the origin of modern misery -- the anxiety in contemporary society, the sense of drift, the purposelessness, the craving for false pleasures. The crisis of modern life was felt by every thinking person in the Christian West. But then again, Europe's leadership of mankind inflicted that crisis on every thinking person in the Muslim world as well. Here Qutb was on to something original. The Christians of the West underwent the crisis of modern life as a consequence, he thought, of their own theological tradition -- a result of nearly 2,000 years of ecclesiastical error. But in Qutb's account, the Muslims had to undergo that same experience because it had been imposed on them by Christians from abroad, which could only make the experience doubly painful -- an alienation that was also a humiliation.
That was Qutb's analysis. In writing about modern life, he put his finger on something that every thinking person can recognize, if only vaguely -- the feeling that human nature and modern life are somehow at odds. But Qutb evoked this feeling in a specifically Muslim fashion. It is easy to imagine that, in expounding on these themes back in the 1950's and 60's, Qutb had already identified the kind of personal agony that Mohamed Atta and the suicide warriors of Sept. 11 must have experienced in our own time. It was the agony of inhabiting a modern world of liberal ideas and achievements while feeling that true life exists somewhere else. It was the agony of walking down a modern sidewalk while dreaming of a different universe altogether, located in the Koranic past -- the agony of being pulled this way and that. The present, the past. The secular, the sacred. The freely chosen, the religiously mandated -- a life of confusion unto madness brought on, Qutb ventured, by Christian error.
Sitting in a wretched Egyptian prison, surrounded by criminals and composing his Koranic commentaries with Nasser's speeches blaring in the background on the infuriating tape recorder, Qutb knew whom to blame. He blamed the early Christians. He blamed Christianity's modern legacy, which was the liberal idea that religion should stay in one corner and secular life in another corner. He blamed the Jews. In his interpretation, the Jews had shown themselves to be eternally ungrateful to God. Early in their history, during their Egyptian captivity (Qutb thought he knew a thing or two about Egyptian captivity), the Jews acquired a slavish character, he believed. As a result they became craven and unprincipled when powerless, and vicious and arrogant when powerful. And these traits were eternal. The Jews occupy huge portions of Qutb's Koranic commentary -- their perfidy, greed, hatefulness, diabolical impulses, never-ending conspiracies and plots against Muhammad and Islam. Qutb was relentless on these themes. He looked on Zionism as part of the eternal campaign by the Jews to destroy Islam. 
And Qutb blamed one other party. He blamed the Muslims who had gone along with Christianity's errors -- the treacherous Muslims who had inflicted Christianity's "schizophrenia" on the world of Islam. And, because he was willing to blame, Qutb was able to recommend a course of action too -- a revolutionary program that was going to relieve the psychological pressure of modern life and was going to put man at ease with the natural world and with God.

V. Qutb's analysis was soulful and heartfelt. It was a theological analysis, but in its cultural emphases, it reflected the style of 20th-century philosophy. The analysis asked some genuinely perplexing questions -- about the division between mind and body in Western thought; about the difficulties in striking a balance between sensual experience and spiritual elevation; about the steely impersonality of modern power and technological innovation; about social injustice. But, though Qutb plainly followed some main trends of 20th-century Western social criticism and philosophy, he poured his ideas through a filter of Koranic commentary, and the filter gave his commentary a grainy new texture, authentically Muslim, which allowed him to make a series of points that no Western thinker was likely to propose.
One of those points had to do with women's role in society -- and these passages in his writings have been misinterpreted, I think, in some of the Western commentaries on Qutb. His attitude was prudish in the extreme, judged from a Western perspective of today. But prudishness was not his motivation. He understood quite clearly that, in a liberal society, women were free to consult their own hearts and to pursue careers in quest of material wealth. But from his point of view, this could only mean that women had shucked their responsibility to shape the human character, through child-rearing. The Western notion of women's freedom could only mean that God and the natural order of life had been set aside in favor of a belief in other sources of authority, like one's own heart.
But what did it mean to recognize the existence of more than one source of authority? It meant paganism -- a backward step, into the heathen primitivism of the past. It meant life without reference to God -- a life with no prospect of being satisfactory or fulfilling. And why had the liberal societies of the West lost sight of the natural harmony of gender roles and of women's place in the family and the home? This was because of the "hideous schizophrenia" of modern life -- the Western outlook that led people to picture God's domain in one place and the ordinary business of daily life in some other place.
Qutb wrote bitterly about European imperialism, which he regarded as nothing more than a continuation of the medieval Crusades against Islam. He denounced American foreign policy. He complained about America's decision in the time of Harry Truman to support the Zionists, a strange decision that he attributed, in part, to America's loss of moral values. But I must point out that, in Qutb's writings, at least in the many volumes that I have read, the complaints about American policy are relatively few and fleeting. International politics was simply not his main concern. Sometimes he complained about the hypocrisy in America's endless boasts about freedom and democracy. He mentioned America's extermination of its Indian population. He noted the racial prejudice against blacks. But those were not Qutb's themes, finally. American hypocrisy exercised him, but only slightly. His deepest quarrel was not with America's failure to uphold its principles. His quarrel was with the principles. He opposed the United States because it was a liberal society, not because the United States failed to be a liberal society.
The truly dangerous element in American life, in his estimation, was not capitalism or foreign policy or racism or the unfortunate cult of women's independence. The truly dangerous element lay in America's separation of church and state -- the modern political legacy of Christianity's ancient division between the sacred and the secular. This was not a political criticism. This was theological -- though Qutb, or perhaps his translators, preferred the word "ideological."
The conflict between the Western liberal countries and the world of Islam, he explained, "remains in essence one of ideology, although over the years it has appeared in various guises and has grown more sophisticated and, at times, more insidious." The sophisticated and insidious disguises tended to be worldly -- a camouflage that was intended to make the conflict appear to be economic, political or military, and that was intended to make Muslims like himself who insisted on speaking about religion appear to be, in his words, "fanatics" and "backward people."
"But in reality," he explained, "the confrontation is not over control of territory or economic resources, or for military domination. If we believed that, we would play into our enemies' hands and would have no one but ourselves to blame for the consequences."
The true confrontation, the deepest confrontation of all, was over Islam and nothing but Islam. Religion was the issue. Qutb could hardly be clearer on this topic. The confrontation arose from the effort by Crusaders and world Zionism to annihilate Islam. The Crusaders and Zionists knew that Christianity and Judaism were inferior to Islam and had led to lives of misery. They needed to annihilate Islam in order to rescue their own doctrines from extinction. And so the Crusaders and Zionists went on the attack. 
But this attack was not, at bottom, military. At least Qutb did not devote his energies to warning against such a danger. Nor did he spend much time worrying about the ins and outs of Israel's struggle with the Palestinians. Border disputes did not concern him. He was focused on something cosmically larger. He worried, instead, that people with liberal ideas were mounting a gigantic campaign against Islam -- "an effort to confine Islam to the emotional and ritual circles, and to bar it from participating in the activity of life, and to check its complete predominance over every human secular activity, a pre-eminence it earns by virtue of its nature and function." 
He trembled with rage at that effort. And he cited good historical evidence for his trembling rage. Turkey, an authentic Muslim country, had embraced secular ideas back in 1924. Turkey's revolutionary leader at that time, Kemal Ataturk, abolished the institutional remnants of the ancient caliphate -- the caliphate that Qutb so fervently wanted to resurrect. The Turks in this fashion had tried to abolish the very idea and memory of an Islamic state. Qutb worried that, if secular reformers in other Muslim countries had any success, Islam was going to be pushed into a corner, separate from the state. True Islam was going to end up as partial Islam. But partial Islam, in his view, did not exist.
The secular reformers were already at work, throughout the Muslim world. They were mounting their offensive -- "a final offensive which is actually taking place now in all the Muslim countries. . . . It is an effort to exterminate this religion as even a basic creed and to replace it with secular conceptions having their own implications, values, institutions and organizations."
"To exterminate" -- that was Qutb's phrase. Hysteria cried out from every syllable. But he did not want to be hysterical. He wanted to respond. How?

VI. That one question dominated Qutb's life. It was a theological question, and he answered it with his volumes on the Koran. But he intended his theology to be practical too -- to offer a revolutionary program to save mankind. The first step was to open people's eyes. He wanted Muslims to recognize the nature of the danger -- to recognize that Islam had come under assault from outside the Muslim world and also from inside the Muslim world. The assault from outside was led by Crusaders and world Zionism (though sometimes he also mentioned Communism).
But the assault from inside was conducted by Muslims themselves -- that is, by people who called themselves Muslims but who polluted the Muslim world with incompatible ideas derived from elsewhere. These several enemies, internal and external, the false Muslims together with the Crusaders and Zionists, ruled the earth. But Qutb considered that Islam's strength was, even so, huger yet. "We are certain," he wrote, "that this religion of Islam is so intrinsically genuine, so colossal and deeply rooted that all such efforts and brutal concussions will avail nothing."
Islam's apparent weakness was mere appearance. Islam's true champions seemed to be few, but numbers meant nothing. The few had to gather themselves together into what Qutb in "Milestones" called a vanguard -- a term that he must have borrowed from Lenin, though Qutb had in mind a tiny group animated by the spirit of Muhammad and his Companions from the dawn of Islam. This vanguard of true Muslims was going to undertake the renovation of Islam and of civilization all over the world. The vanguard was going to turn against the false Muslims and "hypocrites" and do as Muhammad had done, which was to found a new state, based on the Koran. And from there, the vanguard was going to resurrect the caliphate and take Islam to all the world, just as Muhammad had done.
Qutb's vanguard was going to reinstate shariah, the Muslim code, as the legal code for all of society. Shariah implied some fairly severe rules. Qutb cited the Koran on the punishments for killing or wounding: "a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear." Fornication, too, was a serious crime because, in his words, "it involves an attack on honor and a contempt for sanctity and an encouragement of profligacy in society." Shariah specified the punishments here as well. "The penalty for this must be severe; for married men and women it is stoning to death; for unmarried men and women it is flogging, a hundred lashes, which in cases is fatal." False accusations were likewise serious. "A punishment of 80 lashes is fixed for those who falsely accuse chaste women." As for those who threaten the general security of society, their punishment is to be put to death, to be crucified, to have their hands and feet cut off, or to be banished from the country."
But Qutb refused to regard these punishments as barbarous or primitive. Shariah, in his view, meant liberation. Other societies, drawing on non-Koranic principles, forced people to obey haughty masters and man-made law. Those other societies forced people to worship their own rulers and to do as the rulers said -- even if the rulers were democratically chosen. Under shariah, no one was going to be forced to obey mere humans. Shariah, in Qutb's view, meant "the abolition of man-made laws." In the resurrected caliphate, every person was going to be "free from servitude to others." The true Islamic system meant "the complete and true freedom of every person and the full dignity of every individual of the society. On the other hand, in a society in which some people are lords who legislate and some others are slaves who obey, then there is no freedom in the real sense, nor dignity for each and every individual." 
He insisted that shariah meant freedom of conscience -- though freedom of conscience, in his interpretation, meant freedom from false doctrines that failed to recognize God, freedom from the modern schizophrenia. Shariah, in a word, was utopia for Sayyid Qutb. It was perfection. It was the natural order in the universal. It was freedom, justice, humanity and divinity in a single system. It was a vision as grand or grander than Communism or any of the other totalitarian doctrines of the 20th century. It was, in his words, "the total liberation of man from enslavement by others." It was an impossible vision -- a vision that was plainly going to require a total dictatorship in order to enforce: a vision that, by claiming not to rely on man-made laws, was going to have to rely, instead, on theocrats, who would interpret God's laws to the masses. The most extreme despotism was all too visible in Qutb's revolutionary program. That much should have been obvious to anyone who knew the history of the other grand totalitarian revolutionary projects of the 20th century, the projects of the Nazis, the Fascists and the Communists.
Still, for Qutb, utopia was not the main thing. Utopia was for the future, and Qutb was not a dreamer. Islam, in his interpretation, was a way of life. He wanted his Muslim vanguard to live according to pious Islamic principles in the here and now. He wanted the vanguard to observe the rules of Muslim charity and all the other rules of daily life. He wanted the true Muslims to engage in a lifelong study of the Koran -- the lifelong study that his own gigantic commentary was designed to enhance. Butmost of all, he wanted his vanguard to accept the obligations of "jihad," which is to say, the struggle for Islam. And what would that mean, to engage in jihad in the present and not just in the sci-fi utopian future?
Qutb began Volume 1 of "In the Shade of the Qur'an" by saying: "To live 'in the shade of the Qur'an' is a great blessing which can only be fully appreciated by those who experience it. It is a rich experience that gives meaning to life and makes it worth living. I am deeply thankful to God Almighty for blessing me with this uplifting experience for a considerable time, which was the happiest and most fruitful period of my life -- a privilege for which I am eternally grateful."
He does not identify that happy and fruitful period of his life -- a period that lasted, as he says, a considerable time. Perhaps his brother and other intimates would have known exactly what he had in mind -- some very pleasant period, conceivably the childhood years when he was memorizing the Koran. But an ordinary reader who picks up Qutb's books can only imagine that he was writing about his years of torture and prison.
One of his Indian publishers has highlighted this point in a remarkably gruesome manner by attaching an unsigned preface to a 1998 edition of "Milestones." The preface declares: "The ultimate price for working to please God Almighty and to propagate his ways in this world is often one's own life. The author" -- Qutb, that is -- "tried to do it; he paid for it with his life. If you and I try to do it, there is every likelihood we will be called upon to do the same. But for those who truly believe in God, what other choice is there?"
You are meant to suppose that a true reader of Sayyid Qutb is someone who, in the degree that he properly digests Qutb's message, will act on what has been digested. And action may well bring on a martyr's death. To read is to glide forward toward death; and gliding toward death means you have understood what you are reading. Qutb's writings do vibrate to that morbid tone -- not always, but sometimes. The work that he left behind, his Koranic commentary, is vast, vividly written, wise, broad, indignant, sometimes demented, bristly with hatred, medieval, modern, tolerant, intolerant, paranoid, cruel, urgent, cranky, tranquil, grave, poetic, learned and analytic. Sometimes it is moving. It is a work large and solid enough to create its own shade, where Qutb's vanguard and other readers could repose and turn his pages, as he advised the students of the Koran to do, in the earnest spirit of loyal soldiers reading their daily bulletin. But there is, in this commentary, something otherworldly too -- an atmosphere of death. At the very least, it is impossible to read the work without remembering that, in 1966, Qutb, in the phrase of one of his biographers, "kissed the gallows."
Martyrdom was among his themes. He discusses passages in the Koran's sura "The Cow," and he explains that death as a martyr is nothing to fear. Yes, some people will have to be sacrificed. "Those who risk their lives and go out to fight, and who are prepared to lay down their lives for the cause of God are honorable people, pure of heart and blessed of soul. But the great surprise is that those among them who are killed in the struggle must not be considered or described as dead. They continue to live, as God Himself clearly states."
Qutb wrote: "To all intents and purposes, those people may very well appear lifeless, but life and death are not judged by superficial physical means alone. Life is chiefly characterized by activity, growth and persistence, while death is a state of total loss of function, of complete inertia and lifelessness. But the death of those who are killed for the cause of God gives more impetus to the cause, which continues to thrive on their blood. Their influence on those they leave behind also grows and spreads. Thus after their death they remain an active force in shaping the life of their community and giving it direction. It is in this sense that such people, having sacrificed their lives for the sake of God, retain their active existence in everyday life. . . . 
"There is no real sense of loss in their death, since they continue to live."
And so it was with Sayyid Qutb. In the period before his final arrest and execution, diplomats from Iraq and Libya offered him the chance to flee to safety in their countries. But he declined to go, on the ground that 3,000 young men and women in Egypt were his followers, and he did not want to undo a lifetime of teaching by refusing to give those 3,000 people an example of true martyrdom. And, in fact, some of those followers went on to form the Egyptian terrorist movement in the next decade, the 1970's -- the groups that massacred tourists and Coptic Christians and that assassinated Egypt's president, Anwar Sadat, after he made peace with Israel; the groups that, in still later years, ended up merging with bin Laden's group and supplying Al Qaeda with its fundamental doctrines. The people in those groups were not stupid or lacking in education.
On the contrary, we keep learning how well educated these people are, how many of them come from the upper class, how wealthy they are. And there is no reason for us to be surprised. These people are in possession of a powerful philosophy, which is Sayyid Qutb's. They are in possession of a gigantic work of literature, which is his "In the Shade of the Qur'an." These people feel that, by consulting their own doctrines, they can explain the unhappiness of the world. They feel that, with an intense study of the Koran, as directed by Qutb and his fellow thinkers, they can make sense of thousands of years of theological error. They feel that, in Qutb's notion of shariah, they command the principles of a perfect society.
These people believe that, in the entire world, they alone are preserving Islam from extinction. They feel they are benefiting the world, even if they are committing random massacres. They are certainly not worried about death. Qutb gave these people a reason to yearn for death. Wisdom, piety, death and immortality are, in his vision of the world, the same. For a pious life is a life of struggle or jihad for Islam, and struggle means martyrdom. We may think: those are creepy ideas. And yes, the ideas are creepy. But there is, in Qutb's presentation, a weird allure in those ideas.

VII. It would be nice to think that, in the war against terror, our side, too, speaks of deep philosophical ideas -- it would be nice to think that someone is arguing with the terrorists and with the readers of Sayyid Qutb. But here I have my worries. The followers of Qutb speak, in their wild fashion, of enormous human problems, and they urge one another to death and to murder. But the enemies of these people speak of what? The political leaders speak of United Nations resolutions, of unilateralism, of multilateralism, of weapons inspectors, of coercion and noncoercion. This is no answer to the terrorists. The terrorists speak insanely of deep things. The antiterrorists had better speak sanely of equally deep things. Presidents will not do this. Presidents will dispatch armies, or decline to dispatch armies, for better and for worse.
But who will speak of the sacred and the secular, of the physical world and the spiritual world? Who will defend liberal ideas against the enemies of liberal ideas? Who will defend liberal principles in spite of liberal society's every failure? President George W. Bush, in his speech to Congress a few days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, announced that he was going to wage a war of ideas. He has done no such thing. He is not the man for that. 
Philosophers and religious leaders will have to do this on their own. Are they doing so? Armies are in motion, but are the philosophers and religious leaders, the liberal thinkers, likewise in motion? There is something to worry about here, an aspect of the war that liberal society seems to have trouble understanding -- one more worry, on top of all the others, and possibly the greatest worry of all.

How Soon Former Governors Forget

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
ACROSS the country, state governments are laying off employees, raising taxes, postponing construction projects and taking other measures that are clearly bad medicine for a sick economy.
 But the states have no choice. They are facing their biggest budget shortfalls since the end of World War II. California alone is projecting a $35 billion gap over the next 18 months. And unlike the federal government, most states are bound by their constitutions to run balanced budgets. 
 The circumstances vary by state, but the basics are the same. In the prosperity of the late 1990's, the states acted as if the good times would always roll, cutting taxes and spending with abandon. When the economy turned sour, revenue fell sharply, but tax cuts and spending policies were already locked into place.
The National Conference of State Legislatures estimates that the states must reduce their budgets by a total of $26 billion by June 30, the end of this fiscal year in most states. Thirty-three states have budget shortfalls of at least 5 percent; 18 have gaps larger than 10 percent. Next year, the conference figures, state deficits nationwide will be $80 billion or more.
State officials say Washington has added enormously to the fiscal pressure with unfunded mandates.
The largest and most visible of these is Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for the poor. Medicaid accounts for one-fifth of all the money spent by states, and the program's costs rose 13 percent last year alone. In the governors' view, the federal government implicitly assumed responsibility for the health care of the elderly when it enacted Medicare, an entirely federal program. But Medicaid picks up the bills for two-thirds of all nursing-home patients in the country.
Then there is education. The No Child Left Behind Act, the centerpiece of President Bush's education program, requires states to meet rigid performance standards in their schools. But state officials complain that Washington has not provided the resources to comply. New Hampshire school administrators have calculated, for instance, that the law provides an extra $77 a student per year but that it would require $575 to fulfill the law's requirements.
Domestic security is an even more burdensome problem. Mr. Bush had pledged $3.5 billion to reimburse the states and localities for counterterrorism equipment and training. With that in mind, many police and fire departments bought expensive gear like protective suits and communications equipment. But the reimbursements never arrived. 
The crisis became more acute last week with the heightened security alert after the start of the war. New York City will spend an additional $5 million a week on security and overtime.
One might think that the nation's governors would have found a sympathetic ear when they came to Washington last month and asked for help. After all, the president is a former governor, as presidents have been in 22 of the last 26 years. The only exception since Jimmy Carter entered the White House was the first President Bush.
Three of the most influential cabinet members -- John Ashcroft, the attorney general; Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services; and TRidge, the secretary of homeland security -- are also former governors. So are the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Christie Whitman, and 12 senators. The president's budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., is considering running next year for governor of Indiana. 
INSTEAD, the governors were snubbed. "We've got an issue with our own budget, and you've got issues with your budgets," Mr. Bushold them, rejecting out of hand their request for any additional federal money. The Republicans who control Congress were hardly more kind. 
Last week, the White House said the president would ask Congress for an emergency spending package for domestic counterterroism. But the administration offered neither a dollar figure nor details about how the money would be divided.
Where politicians stand often depends on where they sit. "There's no question that when you get into the Washington confusion, you lose sight of the priorities of the states," said Richard W. Riley, who was governor of South Carolina from 1979 to 1987 and then secretary of education for the entire Clinton administration. 
But Washington may come to regret its easy dismissal of the governors' plight. The tax cuts and other steps being taken here to generate economic growth could be largely offset by recession in the states.

Turning Hard Assets Into Liquid Options

BYLINE:  By JESSE KORNBLUTH 

 BODY:
THE good news is that I bought nine cases of 2000 Bordeaux at prices almost as great as the wine. The bad news is that those cases are now starting to make their way from Bordeaux to New York. This summer, the good and bad news will collide -- my wine merchant will call to ask where I would like my cases delivered. And I won't know what to say.
 I used to know. But that was in 2001, when I was working at America Online and the company so bestrode the world that it bought an Old Economy media giant. "A hard asset" is what Steve Case called Time Warner. What's good for Steve, I thought, is good for me. I promptly cashed out tens of thousands of AOL stock options to buy an 1890 farmhouse on two acres in North Salem, N.Y. 
 My wife and I had just furnished that house when a Morrell & Company brochure invited us to get in on the ground floor of 2000 Bordeaux futures -- order (and pay) in 2001, take delivery in 2003. I'm not much of a wine drinker. But AOL stock had split three times since I had signed on, and my options cried out in the night: Use us. 
So as I looked up from my chaise to the ivy-covered root cellar set into our hillside, where the previous owner had stored only homemade jellies, I saw something grander -- a charming vault for a lifetime supply of what was being hailed as the best Bordeaux in two decades. There was also considerable snootball appeal; a guy who had been known to buy groceries with his penny collection could now be a country gent with his own wine cellar. The AOL stock price was holding at a healthy $50. I ordered nine cases.
This was not, I want to say quickly, the kind of conspicuous consumption widely associated with the dot-com era. Our idea of "excess" was comparatively chaste. Most of the wines were the second labels of great estates, costing much less than the first growths; only the Gloria and Duhart-Milon-Rothschild topped my self-imposed limit of $200 a case. Once safely stored at our country house, I thought, they would fit right in with our "antiques" (Pottery Barn), our "new" car (a decade-old Mercedes) and our "lawn service" (me).
Only once were we tempted to splurge. At an art show before the bubble burst, we saw a Degas pastel of a dancer. It was beautiful in the extreme. And it was $400,000. Could we? Back then, thanks to the AOL stock price, we could. Should we? Knowing what we do now, we should have cashed out AOL stock options and acquired another hard asset. Did we? No. A Degas seemed hopelessly beyond us. 
Jump-cut to the present. My wife, Karen Collins, and I are parents of a 1-year-old daughter who shows every sign of requiring a first-growth education. Karen is a full-time mother. I'm no longer at AOL. We've just sold the house in North Salem. And then there are those nine cases of wine.
In the unforgiving winter light of 2003, warehousing wine isn't a topic you can discuss with just anyone, especially if you're talking to people who know you worked at America Online. The verdict on this company is in, and all who worked there have been summarily convicted of boardroom politics, arrogance and greed. Mostly greed.
That's not my story, not at the beginning, anyway. In 1996, I was a 50-year-old writer who had fallen in love with cyberspace and was, for the first time, going to an office. I loved my work as co-founder and editor of bookreporter.com, but start-ups are a killer. So in the spring of 1997, when AOL asked me to be its editorial director and offered me a low-ball salary and a boatload of stock options, off I went to AOL headquarters in Dulles, Va. 
My mandate was to help transform a struggling technology-based company into a media business. Happily, my boss was too busy to supervise me; no one saw most of the special features I created before they went live. But I no longer believe that the "exclusive content" we created made much of a difference to AOL's growth. People didn't come online to read, they came to make friends, get comfort, fall in love -- everything that happens in the real world, just faster and with more drama. Community was the killer app, and AOL's membership tripled in a year.
With success came management. A Taliban of white male vice presidents swarmed into Dulles, bringing organization charts and PowerPoint. Instead of looking outward to our subscribers and subscribers to come, we learned the glories of process. Individual initiative was co-opted by committee; programming now required endless discussion, multiple approvals, constant oversight. I didn't thrive in that culture; management shipped me back to New York. Why didn't I quit? Because, on paper, I was beyond all previous conceptions of rich; it was just a matter of waiting for my options to vest.
AOL stock had drifted down to $15 last fall. By then, I drank my coffee out of cups I'd had emblazoned with "Will Work for Salary." On our last vacation, in Paris, we bought only a Sempe serigraph for the baby's room and a stack of Petit Bateau onesies. Then I was laid off by AOL and reflexively tightened my belt another notch. And I thought once again about my nine cases of Bordeaux, ordered in a peaceful world, to be delivered in a world on fire. Our apartment, once a classic six in Manhattan, is now a toy warehouse. No chance we can empty a closet, raise a bed, keep a room at 55 degrees year-round.
I've tried thinking out of the crate. Perhaps a case or two of wine would make the admissions officers of the Y.M.H.A. nursery school smile upon our daughter's application. Or I could show my "patriotism" and refuse delivery. 
But if any product reminds me that life is not about rigid, black-and-white judgments, it's wine. Will we still be encouraged to hate the French in August, when my wine arrives in New York? Doubtful. Here's a more likely scenario: the euro stays strong, savvy wine lovers snap up 2000 Bordeaux before the prices rise and, a few months from now, the wine I bought two years ago becomes a comparative bargain -- another hard asset. 
And then there are the intangibles. To the wine trade, Bordeaux 2000 is a fruity vintage, exuding cassis, blackberries, plums andcurrant, with notes of melted fudge, oak and cedary cigar box. Although I've tasted none of them, the wines have different flavors for me: nostalgia and hope, ashes and rebirth, whim and will, pride and refusal.
So although I don't know what we'll do with it, I've decided to take delivery of all nine cases. I see no expense account evenings in our future; I do see a bull market for dinners at home. And I see myself being generous with the wine, offering toast after toast -- to the times that were, the times that shall be and, most of all, to high spirits in the face of change.

HEADLINE: And The Oscar Does Not Go to . . . 

BYLINE:  By AMY WALLACE 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
WHEN Nicole Kidman and Meryl Streep make their appearances at the 75th Academy Awards, Kari Wuhrer will not be watching, and her decision has nothing to do with the chance that news from Iraq could lead to the ceremony's postponement. Ms. Wuhrer, a 35-year-old actress, rarely tunes into the telecast in any year -- after appearing in more than 60 B-movies with titles like "The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting" and "G-Men From Hell," she knows that an Oscar is probably beyond her reach. Still, this year, as in all years, Oscar night will cause her pangs of regret.
 "It just depresses me," said the actress, who has perched for so long on the precipice of real fame that she coined her own wry nickname: "the A-list B-girl." A petite brunette, Ms. Wuhrer has worked with Jack Nicholson and Sean Penn in the art-house film "The Crossing Guard." She's been in mainstream fare like the 1997 scary snake picture "Anaconda," and she got second billing in last year's "Eight Legged Freaks," starring David Arquette. She hoped that movie, which was produced by the team that made "Godzilla" and released by Warner Brothers, would be her big break. Instead, it tanked at the box office. So Ms. Wuhrer flew to Romania to make the straight-to-video "Hellraiser: Deader" -- the seventh in a series. 
 "So many opportunities were right there for me," said Ms. Wuhrer, who returned to Romania just 10 days ago to make another movie that won't ever be screened in a theater, "The Prophecy 4." "I thought, 'This is the one, this is the one!' over and over. And it doesn't happen." 
"I've compromised," she continued. "I might have taken my clothes off one too many times in movies. I never, ever, ever expect to be Gwyneth Paltrow. But still, I've just never understood why more people in the business don't know who I am."
When most people think of Hollywood, they imagine palm trees and swimming pools and movie stars with recognizable names and faces. But there is another, far less glamorous Hollywood -- the one inhabited by Ms. Wuhrer and hundreds of actresses like her. This is the world of the B list, and it is meaner -- and far more crowded -- than the A-list fairy tale described in celebrity magazines.
This year, as Hollywood's elite gather for what some have called Ladies' Night at the Oscars, the largely female stars of two movies in particular -- "The Hours" and "Chicago" -- are expected to clean up. But what about the many struggling actresses, the ones who, in the words of one casting director, "get scale after Meg takes all the money"? Forget Malibu beach houses and $20 million paydays. In B-list Hollywood, apartments are shared, credit cards are maxed out and actors -- both male and female -- are thankful to work for scale in low-budget movies made especially for cable, international or straight-to-video markets.
This is a thriving pocket of the film industry. Last month, at the annual American Film Market in Santa Monica, 389 independently financed movies -- a majority of them bullets-and-babes or horror pictures -- were up for sale, nearly twice the number of films (190) released by major Hollywood studios in 2002. You don't need calculus to figure out that B-movies are where a lot of the acting jobs are. But for women, especially, life on the B list is a daily test of resolve. Here, where the casting couch still gets a workout and actresses often need not apply if they won't appear naked in films, the desire to be famous still keeps hope alive. But to talk to some of the hopefuls is to wonder, Is fame worth it?
That question has resonated more powerfully since February, when a B-movie actress named Lana Clarkson was found fatally shot in the home of Phil Spector, the wealthy music producer, whom she had apparently met just hours before. Mr. Spector, who has worked with groups like the Beatles and the Ramones, was arrested on suspicion of killing Ms. Clarkson but has not been charged. Even as the news media rushed to analyze the erratic behavior of this once influential man, the poignant story of his lesser-known companion captured this city's attention.
Ms. Clarkson, 40, had starred in a number of films made by the king of the B-movies, the producer and director Roger Corman. Her occasionally topless roles in films like "Amazon Women on the Moon" and "Barbarian Queen" had won her a cult following. But she had to work as a hostess at a Sunset Strip club to pay the bills. And it was at that club, the House of Blues, where the police say she met Mr. Spector the night she died.
Just days earlier, the actress had delivered a new set of photos and resumes to her agent, who was lining up auditions for television sitcoms. "We were getting ready for pilot season," said the agent, Ray Cavaleri. "She realized she was no longer the ingenue. But she was fine with it. She said, 'Now I can go for the comedy, go for the more character kind of roles.' "
"She had to take the job at the House of Blues because she needed the money," Mr. Cavaleri said. "But she looked at it as a positive. She was working one of the private rooms, so she was networking, meeting the top people." After 20 years in the business, Ms. Clarkson knew that Hollywood is all about relationships. And as a B-movie queen searching for a mainstream job, she also had to know this: She needed all the help she could get.
Just ask Fern Champion, a veteran casting director who for five years cast the television series "Beverly Hills, 90210" but now works frequently on indies with titles like "Scorcher" and "Written in Blood." When Ms. Champion is casting a straight-to-video film, she typically receives more than 1,000 submissions from actors who would walk through fire for even a supporting role. Women over 30 are particularly hungry, Ms. Champion said.
One afternoon recently, Ms. Champion was on the phone trying to book an actress for a cable movie. She told the actress's agent that the producers had some specific demands. "They will not make a deal with her unless there is tasteful nudity in the two shower scenes," she said, adding, "Do you want to have the conversation with her manager about the nudity?"
She hung up, shaking her head. "We've offered the part to another actress with no nudity, but she has a scheduling conflict," she said. So why was this backup actress being required to disrobe? "She appeared in Playboy -- they know she'll do it. God knows, there's way too many unemployed ladies who just need to work."
And all of them have movie star idols. For Lana Clarkson, it was Marilyn Monroe. For Ms. Wuhrer, Judy Garland. "When I was a little girl, I used to watch 'That's Entertainment!' on my black-and-white TV in my bedroom with the door closed," Ms. Wuhrer said. "I would cry that I wasn't Judy Garland. I wanted to be her so bad. There's this blind confidence of youth. You think you can do it all and you've got all the talent in the world. The older you get, the more you lose that."
To help her get it back, Ms. Wuhrer's boyfriend recently gave her a karaoke machine. "I lock myself in the apartment and pretend again to get that imagination going and have more ambition," she said. It's working, sort of. "When people see you as straight-to-video girl or B-movie girl, there's a stigma attached. It's just not fair."
Jenny McShane loves Anne Bancroft. Astriking blonde who won't specify her age other than to acknowledge she's in her 30's, Ms. McShane has been in a string of straight-to-video films, most recently last year's "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon." Since moving to Los Angeles from the Midwest, where she was the oldest of eight children growing up on a 500-acre pig farm, she has had plenty of brushes with stardom. She was a roommate of the actress Emily Lloyd for a while, and once lived next door to Burt Young, who played Sylvester Stallone's brother-in-law in the "Rocky" movies. The other day, she gave a friend who is a hairstylist a ride to Steve Martin's house, and ended up in a bluegrass jam session with him -- she on guitar, he on banjo.
Heady as that might sound, Ms. McShane has faced tougher situations. At 20, she was in a limousine on her way to an airport to shoot her first credited role when the movie's producer suddenly insisted that she agree to "undisclosed nudity" (meaning anything the filmmakers wanted), or she would be replaced. Her agent at the time told her to leave the movie. Instead, she said, she agreed, but then talked the producer out of it. Since then, though, she has bared her body more than once on film.
"I've worked with incredible actors," she said, ticking off a list: Michael Madsen, Keanu Reeves, James Spader, Ben Gazzara. "I worked with Don Johnson on 'Nash Bridges.' I work with actors who should be at the Oscars." And she no longer has to tend bar to pay the rent.
But it's a constant hustle. She has auditioned for 20 television pilots this season and so far has come up empty. "It's really a name game," she said. "Elisabeth Shue just took a pilot. So it's hard competition."
Ms. McShane, who used her real name, Jennifer Miller, until somebody suggested that her mother's maiden name was catchier, has auditioned for directors like Quentin Tarantino and Cameron Crowe. But she has yet to break through. Right now, she's hoping for a callback on a remake of "The Bionic Woman" as a television movie. Whether or not that happens, she says she won't quit.
"I graduated fifth in my high school class," said Ms. McShane, who noted that she had shot three movies in South Africa, two in Bulgaria, one in India, one in Canada, one in France and only one in this country. "I was National Honor Society. I know I have the intelligence to do whatever job I have to."
"I want to do this till the very end," she said. "I want to be like Katharine Hepburn."
Tarri Markel feels the same way. Last year, as the female lead in the coming video "Air Marshal," the 30-something actress for the first time portrayed a character who survived the entire movie. (She had been nibbled to death in "Rats" and shot in the heart in "Death Train.") Ms. Markel, who looks like a cross between her idol, Susan Sarandon, and Sela Ward, has seen agents come and go. (She, like Ms. McShane, is agentless at the moment.) But she is happy to be her own promoter.
"In my previous job," she said, describing the career she junked six years ago to pursue acting, "I sold $50 million of frozen shrimp a year." Back then, she owned a four-bedroom house in the seaside community of Redondo Beach. Now she rents a two-bedroom apartment in the flats of Hollywood. She admitted that when she began acting, "I had a little bit of that 'wait till you get a load of me' attitude."
"But I never expected anything to come easy," she said. "And God knows, it hasn't."
Once, Ms. Markel said, an A-list movie director took a liking to her at an audition. He began calling her at 4 a.m. and asking her to come see his house. She declined. More recently, a B-movie producer offered her a leading role. "He said, 'It's yours,' " she recalled. Then he asked her to perform oral sex. She laughed and tried to make light of it. She didn't want to offend him by saying no; still, she didn't say yes. "But I have to tell you, it flits through your mind," she said. "It's a part. It's $35,000 for six weeks. Well, someone else got the part. She could do it. I couldn't."
Ms. Markel didn't let it get her down. "I'll do whatever it takes -- whatever hard work it takes -- to succeed," she said, counting off the acting classes and the workshops she attends. "A break could come tomorrow or six months from now or six years from now. I don't have a time limit. Because if I did, I'd think it would happen the day after that limit expired."
Before Sharon Stone was Sharon Stone, after all, she appeared in B-movies. So did Sandra Bullock and Ally Sheedy. Angie Harmon did cheesecake in "Baywatch" before she appeared in the television drama "Law & Order." And just last year, Kristanna Loken, a former Norwegian model who had appeared in videos with one-word titles like "Panic" and "Gangland," got the role of T-X/Terminatrix in the coming film "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines."
"So you just never know," said Shana Landsburg, the casting director who put Ms. Loken in "Panic." "Sure, you can do too many 'Panics.' But the bottom line is, I believe, if you're really talented, cream rises to the top."
Or so every B-lister wants to believe. Ms. Wuhrer, for one, has begun to tire of the dream of becoming a household name. Last year she had an epiphany, she said. She had her breast implants removed and began splitting her time between Los Angeles and New York. "I had to get out of L.A. to figure out that the reason I'm in this business is not stardom but because I really love what I do," she said. "You do a certain number of movies, like I have, and, thank God, you'll always be able to get a movie financed. You'll always get at least $100,000 per movie. You'll always make a living.
"I'm proud of the career I have. I have my own section in some video stores. But what I really want is to do a good job -- really work hard at something -- and have somebody go, 'Hey, not only is she good, but we can let her in the club a little bit.' "

HEADLINE: Grounded by War 

 BODY:
Citing the war, Major League Baseball has decided to cancel next week's special season-opening game in Tokyo, featuring Seattle and Oakland. Disappointed Japanese fans must be perplexed by the move. Do the people who crown "world champions" every fall think Japan is somewhere near Iraq, or do they believe that all foreign travel must be equally scary? 
 Many of America's good-will ambassadors -- whether they be athletes, computer salesmen or simply vacationing families -- are likely to avoid the rest of the world at a time when their engagement with others is most needed. This is unfortunate. The grounding of a peripatetic people -- even domestic bookings have dropped dramatically -- has severe economic consequences. It interrupts commerce and is especially devastating to airlines and other travel-related businesses. 
 Some of the nation's most venerable airlines, already battered by a prolonged period of economic sluggishness and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, may not survive this war. United's bankruptcy reorganization is now in peril, with airline officials daring to raise the dreaded "L word": liquidation. US Airways is also in bankruptcy, and American may soon follow. 
The industry collectively lost $18 billion in the last two years, and even a short war could add $4 billion in red ink to what was already projected to be a $7 billion loss for 2003. Memories of how the first Persian Gulf war helped kill off Pan Am and Eastern Airlines only adds to the gloom. 
This presents a delicate problem for Congress and the Bush administration. They must ensure the viability of the nation's transportation system without at the same time overreacting to the plight of any one carrier. The war will certainly deepen the woes of most airlines. But they were already suffering from unsustainable business plans and high labor costs. The war should not become a pretext for interfering with market forces, like those that have fueled the growth of discount carriers like Southwest at the expense of the traditional giants.
Lawmakers should thus resist the more dramatic relief proposals being floated in Washington. These include temporary antitrust immunity that would allow airlines to confer on routes and scheduling, and the notion of providing carriers with subsidized fuel or some vaguely defined compensation for wartime losses. The far-fetched talk of nationalizing airlines is also misguided -- no airline is too big to fail.
What the government can and should do is help carriers overcome identifiable war-related impediments that are beyond their control. It must continue to help make affordable war and terrorism insurance coverage available, for example, and be more generous in reimbursing airlines for post-Sept. 11 security costs. 
Washington must also be more consistent about treating the industry as a deregulated industry. The Department of Transportation has been too heavy handed in opposing a marketing alliance of Northwest, Delta and Continental which would not hurt consumers. And Congress should scrap nonsensical caps on foreign investment, a move that would bring in needed investment capital. But what the airlines, and the broader economy, need most is for Americans, even baseball players, to keep going about their business.

HEADLINE: The Missing Energy Strategy 

 BODY:
The Senate struck a blow for the environment and for common sense last week, defeating President Bush's second attempt in less than a year to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration. Credit goes to the Democrats, who mainly held firm in a close 52-to-48 vote, and to a small, sturdy group of moderate Republicans, which now includes Norm Coleman, a Minnesota freshman who wisely chose not to renege on his campaign promise to protect the refuge despite an aggressive sales pitch from senior Republicans and the White House.
 The pitch included the usual hyperbole from the Alaska delegation, which typically inflates official estimates of economically recoverable oil in the refuge by a factor of four. It also included a new but equally spurious argument minted for the occasion, namely that rising gas prices and the war in Iraq made drilling more urgent than ever. In truth, Arctic oil will have no influence on gas prices until it actually comes out of the ground, and even then it is likely to reduce American dependence on foreign oil by only a few percentage points. 
 Nevertheless it is much too soon for the environmental community or its Senate champions, like Joseph Lieberman, John McCain and James Jeffords, to rest on their well-earned laurels. Drilling proposals will almost certainly resurface, most likely in energy bills now on the drawing boards in both the House and Senate. Beyond that, neither the White House nor the Republican leadership shows any appetite for developing what America really needs: innovative policies that point toward a cleaner, more efficient and less oil-dependent energy future. Instead, the White House and its Congressional allies continue to push a retrograde strategy -- of which Arctic drilling was just one component -- that faithfully caters to President Bush's friends in the oil, gas and coal industries and remains heavily biased toward the production of fossil fuels.
On this score, the energy bills now being drawn up on Capitol Hill offer no more hope than the 2002 models. Last year's energy plan, which mercifully expired in a conference committee, was top-heavy with subsidies for industry and light on incentives for energy efficiency, alternative fuels and other forms of conservation. The news from the relevant Congressional committees suggests more of the same. Just last week, Edward Markey of Massachusetts offered his colleagues on the House energy committee a proposal to increase fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks, including S.U.V.'s, by about 20 percent by 2010. This is not an unreasonable goal, given Detroit's technological capabilities, and would save 1.6 million barrels a day, more than double the recent imports from Iraq and far more than the Arctic refuge could produce in the same time frame. The committee crushed the idea.
The last two years have given the country plenty of reasons to re-examine its energy policies: a power crisis in California, the attacks of 9/11 and now a war in the very heart of the biggest oil patch in the world. It is plainly time to move forward in a systematic way with new ideas. But the best we can do, it appears, is to beat back bad ones.

HEADLINE: In Praise of Failed Diplomacy 

BYLINE:  By Niall Ferguson; Niall Ferguson, professor of history at New York University's Stern School of Business, is author of the forthcoming "Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power."

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
I am saddened, saddened that this president failed so miserably at diplomacy," moaned Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader, earlier this week. "Probably the least successful handling of allies that we've had in a long period of time," sobbed Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House. "When did we become a nation that ignores and berates our friends and calls them irrelevant?" wailed Robert Byrd, the venerable Democratic senator. 
 In Baghdad the bombs are falling. But those sirens you hearin Washington aren't air-raid warnings: they're the lamentations of President Bush's critics. You can hear them in Europe too. On Wednesday, President Jacques Chirac of France accused the United States of "breaching the legitimacy of the United Nations and putting a premium on the use of force." 
 So was the outbreak of war against Iraq the result of a colossal diplomatic failure? Or is this war simply, as Clausewitz might have said, the continuation of policy by other means? 
Consider the prima facie evidence of a blunder. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, international sympathy for the United States was almost universal. Less than two years later, America finds itself outmaneuvered on the Security Council and leading a motley "coalition of the willing," only four of whose members offered military support: Britain, Australia, Poland and -- wait for it -- Albania.
Yet it is worth pondering a curious footnote to French policy offered by Jean-David Levitte, the French ambassador to the United States. It turned out that his country's famous Security Council veto had an escape clause: "If Saddam Hussein were to use chemical or biological weapons, this would change the situation completely and immediately for the French government." 
Now we understand why France pledged to block any Security Council resolution authorizing the use of military force to disarm Saddam Hussein. The French were, in fact, fine with Saddam Hussein possessing weapons of mass destruction. They were happy to keep American forces on standby in the Persian Gulf while the inspectors played missile tag. Saddam Hussein, quite frankly, could keep his chemical and biological weapons. So long as he didn't use them. 
The French have adopted this approach in the past, let's not forget. During the 1930's, for example, they watched inertly as Nazi Germany systematically rearmed, in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. When Hitler reoccupied the Rhineland in March 1936 -- in breach of the Treaty of Locarno of 1925 -- they again did nothing. Their strategy was to defend France behind the enormously expensive and, as it turned out, useless Maginot Line, so they reasoned that attacking Hitler would be futile. In other words, it was O.K. for Hitler to build a formidable army and march it to the French border. So long as he didn't use it 
This and similar analogies with the 1930's have repeatedly been drawn by proponents of war against Iraq. And they are helpful up to a point. Yes, Saddam Hussein is an evil dictator. Yes, it has proved difficult to disarm him by precisely the devices that failed against the dictators between the world wars: collective security, sanctions, diplomacy.
But there we must break off and acknowledge the fundamental difference between the 1930's and now. Germany by 1938 was already an economic and military match for France. Iraq, by comparison, is a flea to the American elephant. The United States economy is 170 times larger than Iraq's. Its military capacity is at least 200 times greater. Going to war against Germany was always risky for France. Going to war against Iraq is pretty much a breeze for America.
To find a workable historical analogy we therefore need to go back further than the 1930's. We need to go back to the 1820's.
Then, in the wake of its victory in the Napoleonic Wars, Britain was the world's only superpower. In 1815 the British Navy truly ruled the waves: it was nearly three times larger than the French Navy. Britain was economically dominant too. With the industrial revolution already under way, its share of global outputwould double from 1820 to 1870.
In the immediate aftermath of the Congress of Vienna, Britain did not flex these growing muscles. It participated dutifully in the congresses held by the European great powers and presided over by Prince Metternich, the ultraconservative Austrian chancellor. These were the Restoration era's answer to the Security Council. 
However, all this changed in 1822, after the suicide of Lord Castlereagh, the depressive British foreign secretary, and the appointment of the mercurial George Canning as his successor. What distinguished the two was Canning's unabashed determination to pursue British interests, with minimal regard for the other great powers.
In language that would surely warm Donald Rumsfeld's heart, Canning expressly refused to take into account "the wishes of any other government, or the interests of any other people, except in so far as those wishes, those feelings and those interests may, or might, concur with the just interests of England." As far as Canning was concerned, Austria and the restored Bourbon regime in France were the powers of the past. He bluntly refused to sanction their interventions to overthrow liberal administrations in Naples and Spain in 1822 and 1823. 
Nor was Canning afraid to take unilateral military action. In December 1826, in order "to defend and preserve the independence of an ally," he sent troops to Portugal to defend the young Queen Maria against a challenge by her uncle Dom Miguel, who had the backing of the new regime in Spain. 
To Canning's critics, this was -- you guessed it -- a colossal diplomatic failure. But did it matter? Scarcely. These assertions of British power signaled a profound shift in the balance of power in Europe away from reactionary Vienna toward liberal London.
Yet there is twist in the tale. Canning did not always act unilaterally. And he did not treat all the other powers with contempt.
In 1826 the Ottoman Empire stamped out a wave of rebellion by its Greek subjects in and around the Balkans. To Metternich, this was entirely satisfactory: another revolutionary threat to the status quo had been thwarted. However, Greek sympathizers in Britain clamored for some kind of intervention, inspired by Byron's martyrdom at Missolonghi. 
Canning was tempted to act. But he was acutely aware that any challenge to Turkish power could open the door to Czarist Russia, which yearned to seize control of the Black Sea straits. Here was a rival power not even Britain could ignore. So Canning struck a deal with Russia that committed the two powers to working together. They would team up to pressure the Turks into granting the Greeks limited self-government. 
The other power of the future that Canning took care not to alienate was the United States of America. In August 1823 he proposed that Britain and the United States jointly guarantee the independence of Spain's former colonies in Latin America, which Canning had been quick to recognize. But President James Monroe spurned this advance, declaring that the United States alone would safeguard the freedom of Latin America from reconquest: hence the Monroe Doctrine. 
There is a lesson here for the Bush administration. For after Iraq, it will have to confront another, more dangerous rogue regime: North Korea. And anybody who imagines that can be done without the cooperation of China is dreaming.
In short, even a hyperpower needs diplomacy -- especially where the powers of the future are concerned. "Splendid isolation" was an ironic phrase when Canning's late Victorian successor Lord Salisbury coined it, even at the zenith of British power.
My tip for Mr. Bush: you're right not to worry about upsetting the powers of the past in Paris and Berlin. But follow Canning's example. Mix unilateral power plays with smart diplomacy. Soon after that victory parade in Baghdad, Mr. President, take a plane to Beijing.

HEADLINE: Muffled Voices 

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
THE phone lines to Baghdad were jammed last week. But not much ever got said over these wires, which have been more a tool of surveillance than of communication since Saddam Hussein's Baath Party took power in 1968. Conversations between Iraqis in New York and Iraqis in Baghdad have typically gone something like this: 
 New York: "How are you?" 
 Baghdad: "Good. Everything is good." 
 New York: "We miss you."
 Baghdad: "We miss you."
 But nothing is good. While their relatives in Iraq have been facing the American "shock and awe" campaign, Iraqis in New York have watched CNN and Al Jazeera, gone to the gym, prayed and tested the phone lines. 
 New York is a mosaic of many peoples, and among them are some very tiny minorities. The city has about 40,000 Bukharan Jews, who left Central Asia after the breakup of the Soviet Union, and some 5,000 Tibetans, who arrived within the last decade. New York's Iraqis post a similarly small figure -- 1,257, and that includes some who come from Iraq but who identify themselves as Chaldeans or Assyrians. Experts say this number may reflect only a third of the population, because of underreporting and other census problems; even so, the Iraqis clearly belong in the tiny category. 
 But unlike other small ethnic groups, the Iraqis have made few marks on their adopted city. While the Bukharans have transformed a corner of Queens and the Tibetans have opened shops and restaurants on the East Side, New York's Iraqis are barely noticeable, even though they began coming to these shores a century ago. This was borne out in 1999 by the Middle East Institute at Columbia University, which surveyed the city's mosques, shops and schools in order to gauge the public presence of Arabic Muslims. 
 "Yemenis were the most visible," said Louis Abdellatif Cristillo, the project coordinator. "The Iraqis and Saudis were the least visible. We're talking two or three people, literally." 
 Even at the heart of New York's Arab-American community, Iraqis are elusive. Recent visits to barbershops, grocery stores and mosques in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Cobble Hill and Bay Ridge yielded a common refrain: "No Iraqis here."
 The faintness of these footprints can be partly explained by factionalism. Iraq, which is home to Muslims, Christians and Jews, has long been riven by ethnic and religious clashes; one legacy of this divisiveness is that New York Iraqis are scattered among the five boroughs rather than huddled in one or two neighborhoods. 
 Economics also plays a role. Because most New York Iraqis are middle class, they can take white-collar jobs and blend into the larger culture.
 But Iraqi invisibility is also a matter of fear. "Saddam's intimidations have had very bad psychological effects," said a wiry biochemist who, like many Iraqis, spoke on condition of anonymity. "I see Iraqis, and I say, 'Hi, I am an Iraqi.' They want to run away. They think I am a spy."
 The following portraits of New York's Iraqis sound this lonely theme. But history is bringing these isolated people closer together. Whether Jewish, Muslim or Christian, they share the experience of exile and, now, of war. 
 Many Iraqi Christians and Jews came to the United States in the 50's, 60's and 70's. Since the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, an estimated four million Iraqis, mostly Muslims, have poured out of that country, and 50,000 of them have come to the United States. Whatever their religion and whenever they arrived, Iraqis have a common history of persecution. Many fled under conditions of extreme duress, and most can list a relative who has been killed or imprisoned by Saddam Hussein's regime.
 "When you meet Muslim Iraqis now and they had the exact same experience you had -- now we know that we've all become one again," said Joyce Raby Reiss, an Iraqi Jew who lives on the Upper West Side.
 The new war has changed them as well. They share a new set of fears -- fear of the F.B.I., fear of the danger war poses to relatives still in Iraq, fear for the question-mark future of their homeland.
 One young Muslim Iraqi, who came to New York in 1997, telephoned his sister in Baghdad one hour after the first airstrikes. The connection was terrible. "I said, 'Bye-bye, if you hear me,"' the man said. He hasn't spoken with her since.

'It Is a Dirty Game'
 A thin minaret rises from the Imam al-Khoei Islamic Center, a Shiite mosque and school in Jamaica, Queens. The blocky complex of dingy white brick is the closest thing Iraqi Muslims in the city have to a home. Sheikh Fadhel Al-Sahlani, the director, fled from Iraq in 1989 and found his way to Queens by way of Thailand, Pakistan, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria and London. What is the most noticeable effect of the new war in his homeland? "I just see myself interviewed more than before," he said. 
 But Mr. Al-Sahlani, a measured man with a salt-and-pepper beard, is loath to call Saddam's Iraq home. 
 "I have been repressed by Saddam," he said. "I am shouting, 'Please give us relief from this criminal!"' A small group of Iraqis who gathered recently in his office -- many of them participants in the failed 1991 uprisings against Saddam -- nodded. 
 Still, Mr. Al-Sahlani paused at the idea of war. "It is a dirty game," he said. "I don't know where it will end."
 The center regularly serves some 5,000 Muslims. Once a month, the Iraqi members, who number fewer than 100, meet at the mosque. Last Sunday, after a lunch of chicken curry and basmati rice with peas, 14 Iraqi men sat on the floor and spoke of war. It was the first time they had gathered, as Iraqis, for a political debate. 
 "If we sit in Iraq in this kind of meeting, we will all be executed," said one man.
 "Wiped out," said another.
 "We'd all be martyrs," chuckled a third.
 "We had other things to talk about in Iraq," said Haeder Mouhammed, the transportation coordinator for the center's Islamic school. "Like where to find food." 
 Mr. Mouhammed, 32, wears a gray fedora and has the loose, vivid gestures of a born Brooklynite. Of his three brothers back in Iraq, one was shot during the Iran-Iraq war, another was executed for desertion and the third imprisoned. To avoid having to report for military duty himself, Mr. Mouhammed hid amid the orange and palm trees of his family's farm on the outskirts of Baghdad. 
 "If they catch me, maybe the first time they cut my ears, then maybe they cut my tongue or they stamp me here," he said, pointing to his forehead. "They make a cross, like, 'Shame on you."'
 In April 1991, Mr. Mouhammed made his way to a small border village and, one night, ran through the Iraqi desert and into the fields of young, green wheat in Syria. After years of odd jobs in Damascus, he came to New York. He knew six words of English: Yes. No. Father. Mother. Picture. Student. 
 He got a job at a fast-food place, U.S. Fried Chicken, in Red Hook, Brooklyn. One evening, a man with a mask and a machine gun came into the shop and told Mr. Mouhammed, "Put the money in the bag now." 
 "I said: 'O.K., O.K. Take it easy."' Mr. Mouhammed replied. "That's a good word I know." 
 His co-worker thought it was a prank, made a joke and the gunman started shooting. Mr. Mouhammed dove behind a refrigerator. Then he quit.
 Back at the mosque, March 14 was the Shia holiday of Ashura, the culmination of a 10-day period of mourning over the martyrdom of Muhammad's grandson in the year 680. "Ashura was a big relief," said a woman who attended the monthly gathering there and wore a gray scarf wrapped snugly around her head. "You just hear the person doing a prayer. Not talking. The talking will not bring anything new." 
 Just after 10 p.m., a circle of women, mostly clad in black, all in hijab, or scarves, pressed their palms to their eyes and rocked back and forth, making the motions of grief as prescribed for the holiday. Children ground potato chips into the gray carpet. In the next room, men beat their breasts. On the wall was a hand-lettered sign that read: "In the end we will conserve only what we love. We will love only what we understand. We will understand only what we are taught." 

A Jewish Community
 Three weeks ago, unofficial word leaked out of Iraq that only 37 Jews were left in Baghdad. Sandy Bechor, 22, has met few people who knew there even were any Iraqi Jews. "When people ask me, I say my parents are from Israel, not Iraq," said Ms. Bechor, who works in her parents' insurance brokerage and lives on the Upper East Side with her sister, Sharon. "Otherwise, they assume I'm a Muslim Arab."
 Often, people assume she's Italian and she lets them do so. It's easier that way. 
 Jews have been coming to New York from Baghdad since the beginning of the 20th century, but the migration quickened when anti-Jewish sentiment grew among Arabs with the founding of Israel in 1948. There were more than 130,000 Jews in Iraq then, many in prominent positions in business and politics. When they left, they left everything. 
 "The losses they suffered were the greatest losses of Jews from Arab countries," said Vivienne Roumani-Denn, executive director of the American Sephardi Federation, which is collecting oral histories and documenting the property losses of Arabic Jews. "It's estimated to be in the billions." 
 Oded Halahmy, 65, a sculptor who lives in SoHo, left Iraq with his parents and siblings in 1951. They forfeited their Iraqi citizenship, took what gold they could carry, and landed in a "transition camp" in the desert in Israel. "I came to New York with no money, no friends, no relatives, no one -- and everything was wonderful," said Mr. Halahmy, who is divorced. "I am a wandering Jew. My home is anywhere. I can create anywhere. And I made it here in New York City." 
 During their decades in New York, Iraqi Jews have formed more institutions than have Iraqi Muslims or Iraqi Christians. In 1934, they founded the Iraqi Aid Society to help fellow Iraqi Jews adjust to city life. In 1945, they established an Iraqi Jewish cemetery in Farmingdale, on Long Island. For the next 40 years, the community gathered in the Waldorf-Astoria and other hotels for social and religious events. Then in 1986, the first and only Iraqi-Jewish synagogue in the city, Congregation Bene Naharayim, opened in a converted ranch house in Jamaica Estates, Queens. Each of the 432 people on Bene Naharayim's mailing list is of Iraqi descent or married to an Iraqi.
 The Bechor sisters, both of whom were born in the United States, went to services at the congregation March 15. Over lunch provided by an Iraqi caterer, the conversation bubbled in Arabic, English and Hebrew as the sisters spoke of how they see others and how they themselves are seen.
 In Great Neck South High School on Long Island, Sharon Bechor said, some classmates teased her, saying that her uncle was Saddam Hussein. After 9/11, some of Sandy Bechor's college classmates said the Jews were responsible for the attacks.
 "When people in my class are talking about antiwar protests, I say, 'Do you understand what my parents went through?" said Sharon, a student at Hunter College.
 Sandy Bechor, who graduated from Baruch College last May, added, "If anyone has ever seen the movie 'Not Without My Daughter' -- the scene where she has to escape literally through the mountains -- that's my parents' story." The 1991 film, starring Sally Field as an American woman married to an Iranian doctor, focuses on her escape from the fundamentalist country with her child. The sisters' parents left Iraq as teenagers in 1970, and were married in Israel shortly before coming to New York.
 But the sisters enjoy parts of their heritage, like Arabic music. "I started taking belly dancing classes in my gym," Sandy Bechor said. When her teacher said she was a natural, she replied, "It's in my blood." 
Unlike many Iraqi Christians and Muslims in New York, few Jews have any relatives left in Iraq. For some, the war has created a strange new possibility: return. "Instead of going to Florida for the winter, I'd like to go to Baghdad," said Ms. Raby Reiss. 
 Others would consider no such thing. In 1969, Saeed Herdoon was arrested at the offices of his family's textile business in Baghdad and imprisoned with two other men in a six-by-six-foot cell. "We used to sleep on our side only because there was no space," Mr. Herdoon said. Six months later, he was released, inexplicably. Meanwhile, a man had walked on the moon.
 In 1970, Mr. Herdoon decided to leave. He poured gasoline on his family photos and set them ablaze. "I would not leave such personal items behind for someone else to touch," he said. He does not want to go back. 

'They Thought I Was Begging'
 Adnan Naum lives in a narrow apartment across from his Christian church, the Salam Arabic Church, in Bay Ridge. On typical afternoons, CNN dominates the living room. Near the television, a doleful-looking Jesus peeks out from behind a frosted glass box. 
 Mr. Naum, 66, taught geology at Baghdad University for 30 years. After he came to New York in 1995 -- his wife and two daughters had arrived in 1993 -- he could not find a job. He felt unwelcome at Islamic and Roman Catholic schools alike. He approached one Catholic school about teaching science and was sent to the food pantry.
 "It was the most horrible moment of my life," he said. "They thought I was begging. I was humiliated. I am upper middle class." Now he teaches English for the Arab-American Family Support Center, which is based in Cobble Hill. Mr. Naum, who belonged to three social clubs in Baghdad, knows just four Iraqis in New York. He misses the water, too. "The water of the Tigris or the Euphrates is sweet," he said, gesturing to a Brita filter in his kitchen. "To me this is bitter."
 Another Iraqi Christian, a woman who came to New York in 1962 to work for the United Nations, sat wrapped in a fox fur coat in a Starbucks on the Upper East Side recently, and tried to explain Iraqi isolation. 
 "We are a closed people," said the woman, now retired and with a deeply lined face. "Tribal. Even though we live in cities, we have tribes or extended families." 
 One Sunday in 1999, she got a call from her brother, who was marooned in a cheap hotel in Southeast Asia. He and his wife had paid a smuggler to take them out of Iraq to Sweden, and he had been caught with a fake Swedish passport. "I'm coming," she told him. "You sit there and tell these people not to throw you out in the street." She took the next plane out. After three weeks, she succeeded in getting the couple to Sweden.
 These days, she rarely tells her story to American friends. "I don't think they get it," she said. "It's too complicated."
 Her thoughts on the war? "Bush is putting Iraqis under siege from the outside," she answered, just as Saddam has put them under siege from the inside.
 Three weeks ago, she stopped watching the news. "I can't take it anymore," she said. "Like we say, the mother whose child is dead can sleep. The mother whose child is threatened by death cannot sleep." 
 When she last spoke with another brother, in December, he was in Baghdad. She hopes he is now in Lebanon.

Dow Has Best One-Week Gain Since 1982

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The start of the war with Iraq gave the stock market a big lift, and the Dow Jones industrial average had its best weekly gain since the beginning of the long bull markets of the 1980's and 1990's. As investors flocked to stocks, bond prices plunged and interest rates rose.
 But while investors and traders watched the war on television, many seemed to be ignoring some negative economic news, including a slowdown in the manufacturing sector and rising unemployment claims. 
 For the week, the Dow rose 8.4 percent, or 662.26 points, to 8,521.97, its best week since Oct. 8, 1982. It was led higher by J. P. Morgan Chase, Disney and American Express. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 7.5 percent, or 62.63 points, to 895.90, its best week since the rebound at the end of September 2001. It was powered by big jumps from Delta Air Lines and Goodyear Tire.
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.1 percent, or 81.51 points, to 1,421.84, its best week since October of last year. Human Genome Sciences and TMP Worldwide helped pull the index higher.
 In the Treasury market, the yield on the 10-year note jumped to 4.10 percent from 3.70 percent a week earlier.

Can You Get To Palestine From Here?

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
SEEKING support for war, President Bush appeared before the world to describe a new commitment to achieving peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, saying he envisioned a state of Palestine side by side with Israel.
 That war was in Afghanistan. 
 Now a new war is under way, just a Scud-shot away from the conflict here. And right before the fighting began, Mr. Bush appeared in the White House Rose Garden to announce that he was "personally committed" to a diplomatic "road map" toward peace and a Palestinian state in just three years. 
This time, the analysts and political leaders say, he really means it.
The reasoning is that President Bush cannot hope to stabilize the region, much less democratize Arab states, so long as the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians endures as a propaganda tool for the likes of Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. After the war with Iraq, Arab leaders will demand that President Bush "prove what he can do for peace," Dennis Ross, the former Clinton administration negotiator, wrote last week in The Wall Street Journal.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, trying to shore up his political base, desperately sought President Bush's new commitment, and trumpeted it when it came, even as he acknowledged that some might doubt American resolve. "The U.S. is now committed -- and, I believe, genuinely -- to the road map for peace," he told the House of Commons last week.
The road map is a seven-page document drafted by the so-called Quartet -- the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan -- on Dec. 20 of last year. It calls for dramatic action by both sides to produce a Palestinian state with provisional borders as early as this year. That would be followed in 2005 by a resolution of the underlying disputes, an acceptance of Israel by Arab nations and a sovereign Palestinian state. 
Particularly given the international auspices of the peace plan, Mr. Blair finds the logic for determined engagement compelling. "I do not believe there is any other issue with the same power to reunite the world community than progress on the issues of Israel and Palestine," he said.
But there is a flaw in all this analysis: The Bush administration has never accepted it. It has never regarded peace between Israelis and Palestinians as a goal as central to American interests as, say, getting rid of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has repeatedly rejected any notion that the administration is not fully committed to pushing ahead. But since Sept. 11, 2001, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has rarely been more than a nagging subtext of the Bush administration's declared war on terrorism. The administration has resolutely resisted making it the text, and linking the resolution of this conflict to its wider war. That is partly because connecting the two could be seen as an admission that American policy on the issue is a legitimate source of Arab anger at the United States. 
This helps explain why, when he appeared in the Rose Garden, Mr. Bush did not even mention Iraq, and why, when he appeared two days later in the Azores to talk about Iraq, he did not mention Israel or the Palestinians.
The administration clearly recognizes there is a problem here, and it may truly want to help. But with rebuilding Iraq, confronting North Korea and addressing the American economy already on its agenda, this conflict may never rise to the level of a top priority, certainly not enough of one to justify the political risks involved in dragging the antagonists along the route outlined by the road map -- particularly during the coming presidential election year. 
It would be much easier, some experts say, for the White House simply to create the impression that it is trying. 
"You have a whole menu of diplomatic activity that doesn't force you to take political risks," said Robert Malley, a former Clinton negotiator who is the Middle East program director of the International Crisis Group, a non-governmental conflict prevention organization. "You don't have to look too far to find the pieces that will fill the diplomatic vacuum that Blair and others have been complaining about."
For example, he said, "an international conference would be seen by Arab countries as a major step, even if didn't change that much" on the ground. Such a move, he said, would eat up time and score the administration political points, without risking a confrontation with Israel.
It is striking how little stock the adversaries here, along with the administration's Quartet partners, are putting in Mr. Bush's new commitment. "Who is he kidding?" asked Dr. Ali B. Jarbawi, a political scientist at Bir Zeit University in Ramallah. "We know he is not going to enforce it."
They recall the mission of Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, the administration's special envoy, around the time of the Afghan war. Mr. Powell said that General Zinni would stay in the region "for as long as it takes." But the violence continued, and about a year ago, the general vanished.
For Palestinians and Israelis the acid test is what Mr. Bush meant when he said, in referring to the road map, that "we will expect and welcome contributions from Israel and the Palestinians to this document that will advance true peace."
The State Department has told its Quartet allies that Mr. Bush was not referring to changes to the substance of the plan, but only to debate over how it should be carried out. But when it comes to Middle East peace, implementation is substance.
ISRAELI officials want basic changes in the document. They say it diverges from understandings reached with the Bush administration. Palestinian officials say they accepted the plan on the understanding that it would be imposed on both sides.
The fundamental question is whether the two sides are expected to make their concessions at the same time or in sequence. 
The plan now calls for action "in parallel," including, for example, an immediate halt to incitement by both sides. As the Palestinians crack down on violence, the Israelis are supposed to stop all punitive demolition of Palestinian homes and dismantle all settlement outposts built in the last two years. 
In addressing the United Nations Security Council recently, Terje Roed-Larsen, the special envoy here, called parallelism "a key guiding principle" of the new plan. 
"Critically, and as we have seen so many times, no cease-fire can take hold without also simultaneously addressing political progress and the economic suffering," he said.
But Prime Minister Ariel Sharon says the Palestinians must act first.
Even if the Bush administration doesn't use all its authority for achieving peace, events may still conspire toward that end.
While Palestinian anger with the United States is growing, so are the signs of increased effort to satisfy American demands. 
For example, the Bush administration has repeatedly called for Yasir Arafat to be sidelined. It largely left it to its Quartet allies and the Palestinians to make that happen -- and last week, they achieved the appointment of the Americans' candidate, Mahmoud Abbas, to the new position of prime minister. It is still not clear how much authority Mr. Abbas will have. 
Then, on Thursday, Palestinian security forces killed a Hamas militant in a renewed campaign to stop Hamas rocket fire at Israel.
"You see the little magnets getting in line with the new American power grid," said Dr. Eran Lerman, director of the Israel-Middle East office of the American Jewish Committee.
On the Israeli side, Mr. Sharon has said that only a diplomatic solution could rescue Israel from its worst economic crisis in 50 years.
Add to those two factors other changes brought to the region with the war, and the pressure from Britain and Arab states, and it just may be that the stars are aligning to turn Mr. Bush's Rose Garden announcement into a serious initiative, said Martin S. Indyk, a former ambassador to Israel and assistant secretary of state for Near East affairs.
"It's those four factors that have the potential to come together in a post-Saddam environment, to convert what started as political payback into a more meaningful peace process," he said.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Freedom vs. Liberty; 
More Than Just Another Word for Nothing Left to Lose

BYLINE:  By GEOFFREY NUNBERG 

 BODY:
WHAT exactly are we fighting for? In his speech to the nation on Wednesday, President Bush said it was to "defend our freedom" and "bring freedom to others." Nowadays, Americans always go to war under the banner of freedom, ours or theirs: Operation Iraqi Freedom follows Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. 
 There was a time when the campaign would have been fought in the name of liberty. The recent efforts to rebaptize French fries as "freedom fries" contrast with the World War I renaming of sauerkraut as "liberty cabbage" and dachshunds as "liberty dogs." Freedom fries may have owed something to alliteration, but liberty was much more prominent in the patriotic lexicon back then than it is now. Americans bought liberty bonds and planted liberty gardens; factories turned out liberty trucks and liberty aircraft engines. 
 If it ever came to all that today, it's a safe bet that we would be talking about freedom bonds and freedom trucks. For that matter, a modern patriot who was writing the Pledge of Allegiance from scratch would probably conclude it "with freedom and justice for all." 
This shift from liberty to freedom is a subtle one, which few other languages would even be able to express. The French national motto is usually translated as "Liberty, equality, fraternity," but liberte could as easily be translated as freedom.
Even in English, the words can sometimes seem to be equivalent. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin used them more or less interchangeably in his essay "Two Concepts of Liberty," and so did the historian Eric Foner in his "Story of American Freedom," which traces the evolution of the concept from Colonial times. Indeed, the words are often incanted in the same breath. "The issue is freedom and liberty," Mr. Bush said a few days before the war began. Or as the Grateful Dead said, "Ooo, freedom/ Ooo, liberty/ Ooo, leave me alone."
But English hasn't taken the trouble to retain all those pairs of Anglo-Saxon and Latin near synonyms just so its thesauruses could be heftier. There's a difference between friendship and amity, or a paternal manner and a fatherly one. 
Liberty and freedom are distinct, as well. As the political theorist Hanna Fenichel Pitkin has observed, liberty implies a system of rules, a "network of restraint and order," hence the word's close association with political life. Freedom has a more general meaning, which ranges from an opposition to slavery to the absence of psychological or personal encumbrances (no one would describe liberty as another name for nothing left to lose).
But the two words have been continually redefined over the centuries, as Americans contested the basic notion of what it means to be free. For the founders of the nation, liberty was the fundamental American value. That was a legacy of the conception of "English liberty," with which Britons proudly distinguished themselves from the slavish peoples of the Continent who were unprotected from the arbitrary power of the state. Echoing John Locke, the Declaration of Independence speaks of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." The text doesn't mention freedom at all. It was liberty that Patrick Henry declared himself willing to die for, and liberty that the ringing bell in Philadelphia proclaimed on July 8, 1776.
Liberty remained the dominant patriotic theme for the following 150 years, even if freedom played an important role, particularly in the debates over slavery. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address began by invoking a nation "conceived in liberty," but went on to resolve that it should have a "new birth of freedom."
But "freedom" didn't really come into its own until the New Deal period, when the defining American values were augmented to include the economic and social justice that permitted people free development as human beings. Of Roosevelt's Four Freedoms -- of speech, of religion, from want and from fear -- only the first two might have been expressed using "liberty.'
The civil rights movement made "freedom now" its rallying cry. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. used "freedom" 19 times in his "I Have a Dream" speech, and liberty only twice. Feminists extended freedom to cover reproductive rights, while Timothy Leary spoke of the "fifth freedom . . . the freedom to expand your own consciousness."
But as Professor Foner has observed, freedom is too central in the American consciousness to remain the property of one political side. The conservative reclaiming of the word began during the cold war, when it was expanded to include the benefits of free markets and the consumer choices they provided. Then, too, freedom was a conveniently vague label used to describe free-world allies like Franco's Spain, whose commitment to liberty was questionable.
President Ronald Reagan understood the power that "freedom" had acquired. His second Inaugural Address mentioned freedom 14 times and liberty only once. But in the mouth of Mr. Reagan and other conservatives, freedom conveyed what Isaiah Berlin called its negative sense, an absence of constraints on markets and individual action. Mr. Reagan's program of "economic freedom" included deregulation, tax cuts and a weakening of unions, which earlier conservatives had championed in the name of the "liberty of employers."
The invocation of freedom became as reflexive for the right as it had been for New Deal Democrats and those in the civil rights movement. Opponents of civil rights legislation appealed to "freedom of association," and opponents of affirmative action have spoken of "freedom from race." On the National Rifle Association's Web site, the word freedom is three times as frequent as the word liberty.
But as the expanding use of "freedom" makes every policy and program a part of the national mission, "liberty" has receded from the patriotic vocabulary. If we still venerate the word now, it's less as a rallying cry than as a stand-in for the legalistic niceties that the founders took such trouble over. That's why the word still comes up when the conversation turns to the domestic war on terrorism, whether in the expression "civil liberties" or standing alone. 
Lately, Bush administration figures have been trying to wrest the word from the critics of their homeland security measures. 
When a special appeals court upheld the wiretap provisions of the USA Patriot Act a few months ago, Attorney General John Ashcroft called the decision "a victory for liberty, safety and the security of the American people." And last week, the secretary of homeland security, Tom Ridge, announced Operation Liberty Shield, which will step up surveillance of those suspected of terrorist ties and authorize indefinite detention of asylum-seekers from certain nations.
BUT many still hold that liberty and safety, like guns and butter, are notions that are more appropriately opposed than conjoined. They're mindful of Benjamin Franklin's warning that "they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
Right now, "Iraqi Freedom" conveys something more basic than "American freedom" suggests -- it is simply emancipation from tyranny, not a choice of S.U.V.'s or an end to double taxation of dividends. The Iraqis may someday enjoy those more advanced varieties of freedom. Ultimately, they may even enjoy liberty. But that will require more time, and as we have had ample opportunity to learn, eternal vigilance.

HEADLINE: Cuban Exiles Finding Spirit of Reconciliation 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 22 

 BODY:
Like thousands of other Cuban exiles here, Juan Cabrera left behind his family, job and home with the hope of someday returning to a democratic island.
 But unlike many who came before him, Mr. Cabrera, 30, says that the best way to achieve the dream is not by toppling Fidel Castro, starving his economy or keeping relations with Cuba in the deep freeze, where they have been for 40 years. 
 "If you're a boxer and you're fighting someone who no one has knocked out, you can't use the same tactic that everyone else has," said Mr. Cabrera, who sends money to his family in Cuba every month. "You have to change it to work." To Mr. Cabrera, that means compromise and negotiation with the Castro government, not embargoes and coup plotting. 
Until recently, such a view would have placed Mr. Cabrera among the dovish fringe of Cuban exiles, especially here in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood, where Mr. Cabrera lives and sells black beans, rice and chicken out of a converted postal truck.
Now, though, a growing number of Cuban immigrants say they favor a more conciliatory approach to Cuban relations.
According to a recent poll commissioned by the Cuban Study Group, an organization of Cuban business executives, a majority of Cubans now believe that the policy of confrontation with the Cuban government has failed to bring about substantial change for people there.
Sixty-one percent of respondents agreed that an attitude of "forgiveness and reconciliation" must be part of any government transition in Cuba, and 69 percent said that dissidents in Cuba were more important to a transition toward democracy than exile leaders in Miami.
Another poll conducted by Schroth & Associates for The Miami Herald showed that 54 percent of Cubans here support a meeting scheduled for next month in Havana between exiles and Cuban government officials.
Such views are even echoed by the leader of the Cuban American National Foundation, the most powerful organization representing exiles in the United States, who said recently that the group had undergone a "change in focus" and now favored beginning a dialogue with Cuban government insiders.
"Isolating ourselves and not communicating and not getting our message out is dooming us for failure," Jorge Mas Santos, president of the foundation, said in a recent interview. "I am not going to accept being an observer of this process or just waiting for Castro to die by either adopting positions that are unrealistic or not pragmatic," he said.
This moderation, though not universally embraced, signals a significant shift in ideology from a decade ago, when nearly 75 percent of Cubans in South Florida supported removing President Castro from office by force, experts on Cuban affairs say.
They say the change in attitudes reflects an ideological split between the original Cuban exiles and their children and grandchildren, a recent influx of immigrants who fled for economic rather than political reasons, and a concerted effort by some exile groups to improve the image of Cuban Americans after the nationally televised struggle over the young shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez. 
"What that brought about is a rejection of confrontation about how to deal with Castro to one that can almost be described as somewhere between reconciliation and negotiation," said Sergio Bendixen, president of Bendixen Associates, a Miami company that conducted the poll for the Cuban Study Group.
Some old-school, anti-Castro hard-liners, including some prominent Cuban-American politicians, contend the polls are simply wrong.
To reassert their disdain for Castro and their opposition to any negotiations with his government, some exile groups are planning a demonstration for next weekend in the streets of Little Havana.
"I think you will see a response to such a position on March 29, when Cuban community comes out in masse for a big demonstration to say that we're still in favor of keeping the embargo and that we're against any dialogue with any of Fidel Castro's henchmen," said United States Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Miami Republican of Cuban descent who supports the tough anti-Castro stance.
"I think it's a farce for anyone to seriously think that a dialogue is possible with anyone in the Castro regime who is not a puppet of the dictator himself," said Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, who said she did not believe the polls' findings.
Despite the debates, supporters of more moderate Cuban relations say a growing number of people now realize that new tactics are needed for communicating with people living on the island and to better prepare for a post-Castro Cuba. 
"When a crisis happens in Cuba, we want the Cuban people to know that the exile community is there to help them," said Mr. Mas Santos, who succeeded his late father, Jorge Mas Canosa, as the leader of the foundation. "The day Castro and his brother die, there has to be engagement with those who are staying in power."
The foundation says it still opposes communicating directly with Mr. Castro or his brother and military leader, Raul Castro, but its critics say starting a dialogue with the government is essentially fostering a relationship with the Castros.
"If Cuba decides to open a dialogue with the Cuban exiles, that would be a disaster, because that means that the exiles recognize them as the legal government of the island and they have not been elected by the people," said Diego Suarez, a founding member of the Cuban Liberation Council, an exile group created by former foundation members that embraces the anti-Castro hard line.
"Nothing will change," Mr. Suarez said. "The Cuban government is laughing when they see these people now give up."
But the leader of the group that commissioned one of the polls said that such anti-Castro rhetoric was outdated and no longer effective.
"People who came in the 1980's and 90's are people who left behind a lot of friends and relatives and need to have contact with Cuba and call and visit more often," said Carlos Saladrigas, a banking executive in Miami and chairman of the Cuban Study Group. "They have a greater realization than the people who left in the 60's that isolation is not the way to deal with a totalitarian regime."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: ARAB CRITICISM; 
Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Urges U.S. to Pause From Invasion

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, March 22 

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Prince Saud al Faisal, urged the United States today to "have a breather" in its invasion of Iraq and give the United Nations another chance to disarm the country peacefully.
 "Stop the war, let's sit down, let's have a breather after what we have seen of the destruction," the prince said, speaking to a gathering of Western journalists in the Islamic kingdom's foreign ministry building. 
 The 61-year-old prince, a son of the revered late King Faisal, also called on Saddam Hussein to "start to think of the sacrifices he can make for his country," implying that the Iraqi leader should seek exile rather than see his country destroyed. 
While Saudi Arabia has not offered sanctuary to Mr. Hussein, Prince Saud said the kingdom would allow safe passage for the Iraqi leader and his family through the kingdom to reach a third country. The neighboring island kingdom of Bahrain has offered to take Mr. Hussein.
Saudi Arabia has been a vocal critic of Washington's war plans since they were first discussed a year ago. Like many countries in the region, the kingdom fears the conflict could destabilize its own society, which is struggling with a volatile mix of high unemployment and religious extremism among its youth.
Saudi Arabia's position is particularly sensitive because the United States Air Force commander in charge of the bombing campaign in Iraq is stationed at a Saudi air force base just south of the capital -- a fact not discussed by the local press or widely known to Saudi citizens.
Prince Saud condemned the invasion's aim of destroying the Iraqi government as "outside of the framework of international legality," and warned that rebuilding what has been destroyed will be a dangerous, difficult task.
"Bringing it back again is going to be a job I don't envy those who are going to be handed it," he said.
He said he was worried about talk of a military occupation government, adding that he doubted the ability of American and British officials to finesse the web of tribal and ethnic relationships that any government in Iraq must handle to maintain peace.
"We don't think that is advisable at all," the prince said. "The government we would like to see in Iraq after the war is the government that is formed by the Iraqi people."
He called on the Security Council to take up the Iraqi issue again without delay, both to try and stop the fighting and to decide how to manage Iraq after the conflict.
"It just seems to me it will be a very tough situation to handle unless the United Nations comes to the fore in this and gets whoever is there from the present government to cooperate with them for the process of what they call democratization," he said.
The Saudi government has said it will not send troops to Iraq, but the prince said it would consider contributing peacekeeping forces if asked by the United Nations and Iraq.
Prince Saud also repeated his government's longstanding plea for the United States to help solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, "which has been at the heart of the problems and the troubles in the region."
"If there is stability, if there is peace in the Middle East, that is the way that will bring about a democratization and an opening of society," the prince said, "not through war."

HEADLINE: Party of One 

BYLINE:  By Matt Bai; Matt Bai is a contributing writer for the magazine. His last article was a profile of Gary Hart.

 BODY:
Lincoln Chafee doesn't get a whole lot of respect from other Republicans. Senators and strategists from his party dismiss the junior senator from Rhode Island as a joke, portraying him, rather viciously, as vacant or, worse yet, borderline impaired. Some Republicans even mock Chafee when he's not around. "It's kind of like junior-high days," laments Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska.
 Of course, Chafee is an easy target; he often doesn't seem to grasp the lingo of the Senate, much less its customs. One Senate aide relates the story of a news conference at which participants were advised to "stick to the script." Chafee looked puzzled, the aide recalls. "Is there a script?" he asked, apparently serious. "I haven't seen it." 
 He isn't just the class doofus, however. His father, John Chafee, whose seat Lincoln essentially inherited after his father's death four years ago, was the soul of the G.O.P.'s moderate faction and a revered statesman in Washington, and this in itself gives Lincoln Chafee some gravity. His vote is critical in a Senate that is almost equally divided. And at a time when the Republican ranks are remarkably well disciplined, Chafee has emerged as the most cutting Republican critic of the president's foreign and economic policies -- especially the invasion of Iraq. He was the only G.O.P. senator to vote against the October resolution authorizing Bush to use force in Iraq, and he has continued to voice his disdain, even as the rest of the party -- along with many Democrats -- has rallied to the president's side. Chafee was also the only Republican to side with the Democrats on the fight over a new Homeland Security Department and the first to push publicly for Trent Lott to step down as majority leader. 
On first impression, it's hard to know whether Chafee is truly the oddity everyone says he is or whether there's something studied about his eccentricity. Though he turns 50 this week, he still looks a little like the rich prep-school kid he once was, with longish hair parted in the middle and tasteful Ferragamo ties. As a younger man, he shod racehorses, and on his walls he keeps a set of chromed horseshoes and a portrait of himself on the cover of Hoof Beats magazine. When I first spoke with Chafee, on the morning after the State of the Union address in January, I noticed that he looked down a lot and that he would occasionally nod several times in quick succession, like a child accepting a scolding. 
But there was nothing meek about Chafee's assessment of the president's speech. Republicans on Capitol Hill were still swooning over Bush's indictment of Iraq, but Chafee remained dead set against war. "I don't think the president has articulated his reasons consistently," he said. The administration, he contended, has "just been shifting justifications throughout the debate."
When I asked about Bush's plan to make his tax cuts permanent, Chafee actually groaned. Chafee and John McCain were the only Republicans to oppose the final tax cut plan in 2001. "It's been a mistake," Chafee said. "They've had no stimulative effect." Bush's idea to restructure Medicare, Chafee said, was "depressing." And the president's Clear Skies Initiative was designed to sound compassionate, Chafee said, but ignored the central issue of greenhouse gases. 
After a while, I asked Chafee if there were any major pieces of Bush's agenda with which he could wholeheartedly agree. He paused for about 10 seconds, with his hands pressed together prayerfully.
"It's difficult," he said finally. "Because he's chosen a divisive path, and it is working for the administration. On so many issues, they just pound the wedge in."
In other words, I suggested, he has a hard time finding even one point of agreement.
"Yes, I do," Chafee answered, looking embarrassed.
With most of Washington fixated on the coming war, the White House and its allies on the Hill were preparing to push through a radical program that would, among other things, rewrite the tax code, loosen more environmental rules and ensure a decade of expanding deficits. At the same time, Bush's approval ratings, while still respectable, were slouching toward the 50 percent threshold, and polls showed a plurality of Americans uneasy with the president's handling of the economy. Not quite the moment for a full-fledged coup, perhaps, but it might be enough to embolden a united front of centrist senators from both parties to make a stand against the Bush agenda.
For Chafee, this is a chance to step out and lead. He finds himself torn, however, by dueling impulses handed down from his father's generation to his own. On one hand, he is very much aware that in his father's world, seniority counted for everything; you respected your elders and waited for your opportunities. 
But the genteel Senate of John Chafee's era is, in fact, about as relevant today as the neighborhood five-and-dime. The way Chafee sees it, everything his father cherished is now under attack, and time is short. If he waits his turn, there will be nothing left to fight for. And so Lincoln Chafee faces a choice: he can be the kind of deferential junior senator his father would have admired, or he can stand up and defend the old man's legacy.
Chafee was never the kind of politician's son who inspires talk of a dynasty. After earning a degree in classics from Brown, young Linc -- captain of the wrestling team, scion of one of Rhode Island's five governing families -- wandered off to Bozeman, Mont., to earn a kind of graduate degree in, of all things, shoeing horses. Although Chafee had lost a younger sister when she was kicked in the head by a horse, he nonetheless chose a career as a farrier. Family members say that his father, a champion of the working man, liked the idea of Lincoln learning a trade. Sleeping in his corroding old Volvo, Chafee drove north to Alberta until he caught on as a regular on the Canadian racing circuit. He lived that solitary life for seven years, making few friends, until finally he returned to Rhode Island more introverted than anyone had remembered.
His father, a onetime Navy secretary and governor, was an iconic leader in the Senate and an ardent champion of environmental causes. Lincoln, however, was more like his mother, Virginia, who did her best to avoid public life. During his first campaign, for delegate to the state's constitutional convention in 1984, Chafee drove out to a neighborhood in his native Warwick to knock on doors. He sat there for 20 minutes, holding a stack of palm cards with his picture on them, trying to work up the courage to get out of the car. 
I asked Chafee what made him decide to run for Warwick's City Council and then for mayor, an election he lost before coming back to win four terms. "My father loved his job," Chafee said. "I thought: Well, isn't that the key to life? You should love your job."
When John Chafee died from a heart attack in 1999, Lincoln, who had already announced that he would run for the seat after his father's retirement, was appointed to succeed him. Friends say he nearly turned down the appointment; stubbornly, he wanted to win the seat on his own. When the day came for his swearing in, a Senate aide found Chafee seated at his father's desk on the verge of tears. "I didn't want to get here this way," he said.
Chafee relied heavily on Democratic disunity and his famous name to get himself elected the following year. But his defiance of the administration has since helped him build a strong following among Rhode Island's overwhelmingly Democratic electorate. And his shyness around TV cameras hasn't hurt him much in a tiny state where people aren't surprised to run into their senators at the local grocery store. Chafee may not be the most recognizable or dynamic political figure in the state, but he can hardly leave the house without seeing someone he knows; when the nightclub fire claimed almost 100 lives in West Warwick last month, the senator immediately recognized a neighbor and a few acquaintances among the dead and injured.
In Washington, however, Chafee's lack of pretension and his discomfort in social situations were, from the start, seen as something else: signs of weakness. Chafee had set foot only once in the Capitol before he was elected, and he was an alien in the Senate's stifling culture. At first, if he found another senator sitting in his seat on the Senate floor, Chafee would stand in the aisle, waiting patiently and speaking to no one. An aide finally took pity on him and told him it was O.K. for him to sit somewhere else. Chafee has gone only once to the senators' dining room; though he says it led to a nice conversation with Thad Cochran of Mississippi, he has never returned. He prefers to eat lunch at his desk, with the newspaper. 
Inevitably, Republican insiders compared Chafee with his father and came away baffled. Two theories took hold and are often repeated: either the younger Chafee is a few votes short of a quorum or he's actually cagier than anyone realizes and enjoys being inscrutable. In fact, after you spend some time with Chafee, neither analysis seems right. He's not dim, nor does he have much capacity for guile or irony. He is, instead, a slow starter who learned early in life to ask questions, persevere and wait his turn. "He's not a giver-upper," is how his mother described him to me.
In his father's Senate, no one would have taken it personally if a freshman Republican from a liberal state voted against his own party. (According to a breakdown by National Journal, Chafee's voting record actually puts him ideologically at the dead center of the Senate.) But this is not his father's Senate. The Bush administration's mantra in foreign policy goes for Capitol Hill, too: "You're either with us or against us." And because Chafee has been against the party's leaders almost from the start, they seized on his quirkiness and inexperience as a way of discrediting him. 
Predictably, this seems to have only deepened his resolve.
"We all want some self-respect, and we all want to be taken seriously," Senator Hagel said. "If you treat him like a U.S. senator, if you treat him like he's got a brain, if you treat him like you respect his questioning, and if there's an honest difference of opinion, then O.K. That's all any of us want. If we disagree, we disagree. But you can't go around impugning people's motives. They do that with John McCain up here, too. They do it with all of us, to some extent."
In a strange way, history seems to have cast Chafee as the unlikely foil to the swaggering president -- a kind of Bizarro Bush. The two men, roughly the same age, have a remarkable amount in common. Both the Bushes of Kennebunkport and the Chafees of Warwick hail from a powerful line of Yankee Republican senators, a tradition that spawned liberal-leaning giants like Henry Cabot Lodge and Margaret Chase Smith. Both George W. and Lincoln avoided the family business as younger men, acutely aware that they couldn't measure up to the success of their Yale-educated fathers. Both relied on their fathers' names to make late entries into politics.
Chafee remained loyal to the tradition of Yankee Republicanism. But Bush took a very different path within the party. Increasingly, the South has come to dominate G.O.P. politics, and Bush, who watched his father fall prey to this tectonic shift in the party's base, built close ties to religious conservatives. As president, he hasn't simply ignored his grandfather's more liberal wing of the party; he has laid siege to it. While Chafee told me that he likes and respects the Bush family, he admitted that he feels betrayed by George W.
"This president campaigned as a moderate," he said. "'I'm going to change the tone in Washington. I'm a uniter -- not a divider.' And that's been the biggest disappointment. It was such a surprise to see the agenda. It was so different from the campaign rhetoric."
Given all this, it is reasonable to wonder why Chafee doesn't simply flee the G.O.P. As recently as last fall, he listened over dinner as his father's old friend Senator Jim Jeffords laid out all the benefits of sitting as an independent. But Chafee is a Republican by birth, and he says he believes -- naively, perhaps -- that his vision of the party will endure longer than Bush's. "The pendulum swings," Chafee said, "and hopefully, it will swing back."
I asked Chafee if, in the end, it just isn't in his constitution to be anything other than a Republican.
"I'll be honest with you," he said. "Back in the spring of 2001, it was just this avalanche -- we had the tax cuts and were getting out of the missile-defense treaty. And I thought: I have to do something. What can I do? But the next step that had to be taken" -- bolting the party, in other words -- "as you say, I was just constitutionally incapable."
That leaves open the question of what Chafee is capable of doing to sway his party. Is he just a strange guy with a stubborn streak, or does he possess the ability to lead?
The once powerful moderate faction in the G.O.P. has dwindled, but still, there are four Northeastern senators -- Chafee, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, both from Maine -- who meet weekly to discuss issues and strategy over lunch or breakfast. Combined with a bloc of like-minded Democratic centrists and Jeffords, this small caucus does have enough influence in a split Senate to broker compromises on major legislation; the G.O.P. centrists helped scale back Bush's initial tax cut, andmore recently, they helped end an impasse over rules for the new Homeland Security Department. Still, the moderate resistance has often crumbled under pressure from the White House. Specter, Snowe and Collins have all voted with Bush when it mattered most. 
Chafee's role in the moderate caucus has primarily been to articulate broad principles; he prefers to leave back-room negotiating to others. When more than a dozen senators from both parties began meeting last month to forge a more moderate alternative to Bush's deficit-expanding economic plan, Chafee refused to take part in the discussions. He told colleagues he could not in good conscience support any new deficit spending with war looming and job losses mounting. "For me, it's hard to decide where I want to end up on this issue," Collins told me. "For Linc, it's not. He knows where he wants to be. I say that with some envy."
But by holding fast to principle and excusing himself from the deliberations, Chafee also relegated himself to the role of spectator, rather than trying to have some influence on the size of the tax cuts that will, in some form, inevitably pass the Senate. He chose, in effect, to be right rather than to be effective.
When I asked Chafee just what it was he was planning to do, practically, to counter the White House's agenda, he physically flinched. His vote alone, he said, is an important statement.
"Maybe it will bring other people to think that voting your conscience can work," he went on hopefully. "Maybe there's some leadership in that. Maybe it will accomplish the end objective, whatever that may be -- keeping the economy rolling, stopping the war in Iraq." This sounded so lame, even to him, that a moment later he began to argue the other side.
"Yes, yes, but then it boils down to just one vote out of 100." He thought, reversed himself again. "A lot comes out of a vote, though."
This went on for some time, with Chafee at turns avoiding the question and examining it, as if he himself was trying to figure out what kind of senator he really is.
"If you're saying, ideally, what would I do to effect the change that I believe is best for my country?" He creased his brow, shook his head. "I'm trying to answer that question also."
if this were a movie, maybe Lincoln Chafee would make a lonely sojourn to Colt State Park on a still Rhode Island night, standing before the imposing bronze statue of his father, waiting for the onset of clarity. In reality, Chafee doesn't have time for spiritual searches. Congress will soon be casting decisive votes on the president's program, votes that will frame the 2004 election. And if Chafee can't figure out how to challenge the White House tactically, then he'll remain a kind of senatorial Cassandra, warning of unseen consequences while his colleagues make the deals that determine the direction of the country.
Chafee may have few doubts about where he stands on these issues, but his angst over what, if anything, he should do about it is plain. On a recent morning in his Washington office, Chafee debated himself over whether to try to catch the end of a Foreign Relations Committee hearing he'd had to leave earlier in the morning. While Chafee was eager to hear the testimony of a former government analyst who opposed an invasion of Iraq, it would take 10 minutes to get to the hearing room in the next building, and by then he might have missed most of the questioning. Chafee stood frozen in his office, weighing aloud whether he should stay or go.
He decided finally to make the journey, and I accompanied him through the labyrinth of hallways, watching him pause every so often amid the lunchtime rush to find his way. An elderly couple, who obviously had no idea who he was, stopped him to ask for directions, which he politely provided. Capitol guards called out to him warmly. When at last Chafee arrived at the mostly empty hearing room and slipped into his seat, the committee's chairman, Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican, turned to him with surprise.
"Senator Chafee, I see you've returned," Lugar said brightly. "Does that indicate a desire to ask more questions?"
I expected Chafee, as the only Republican vocally opposed to war, to engage the witness in senatorial fashion. Instead, Chafee, the junior senator, followed his instincts and deferred to his elders, just as his father might have advised.
"No, no," Chafee responded, shaking his head at the chairman.
Lugar nodded uncertainly, then proceeded to thank the witnesses and bang the gavel, adjourning the hearing. For Lincoln Chafee, another moment had passed.

HEADLINE: Battling the Fog of Finance 

BYLINE:  By James Grant; James Grant is editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.

 BODY:
War has enough to answer for without being blamed for problems not of its own making. Last week the Federal Reserve excused itself from venturing any forecast about the United States economy pending the abatement of "geopolitical uncertainties."
 But it isn't the fog of war that has shortened the vision of our monetary policymakers. It's rather the fog of finance, particularly the long legacy of America's greatest stock-market bubble. The truth about the three-year decline in stock prices and the hot-and-cold-running economy is that they have their roots in prosperity, not in war. 
 The paradox is easily explained. High stock prices invite capital investment. Ultrahigh stock prices invite redundant capital investment. Stock prices higher even than those on the eve of the 1929 crash invite titanically redundant capital investment. No wonder, then, that business spending on new plant and equipment has been so weak for so long: The sky-scraping stock market of the late 1990's (which indeed commanded valuations higher than those of 1929) induced enough corporate spending to sate demand and cause a recession.
That recession, which began in March 2001, is probably over by now (the official cyclical timekeeper, the National Bureau of Economic Research, continues to weigh the evidence). But the recovery is heavy-footed and faint-hearted. High energy prices and stay-at-home travelers haven't helped. Nor has worry about a new terrorist attack. But the source of America's persistent financial aches and pains is something more basic: the preceding mispricing of capital.
In the manic phase of the bull market, capital was essentially free. The frittering away of American savings wasn't intentional. It happened inadvertently, through investing: in telecommunications equipment, semiconductor manufacturing plants, computer servers, power generators, office furniture, Internet initiatives, etc. We invested more than we should have -- in fact, more than we had. We borrowed to invest, from creditors both domestic and foreign.
And because the law of supply and demand is everything it's cracked up tobe, the bull market ended. More productive capacity spurred higher output, which led to more intense competition and -- no surprise -- to lower profit margins. And those things led to lower stock prices, which, in turn, led to a crash in capital investment.
There was no "new economy" after all. Now almost one-quarter of corporate productive capacity is lying idle. All too many job seekers find themselves in the same predicament.
The war is not to blame for this sequence of events, which was set in motion years before 9/11. But the cost of the war (and future wars, pacifications and occupations) may prove burdensome in ways that Americans have been privileged not to have to worry about.
The United States at the millennium is an historical oddity, not only a great power but also a great debtor. It consumes much more than it produces. It imports much more than it exports. And it owns much less of foreign assets than foreigners do of American assets ($2.3 trillion less, as of the end of 2001). In 2002, Americans imported about $500 billion more than they exported -- that being the size of the current account deficit, a comprehensive measure of the net flow of goods and services between the United States and the rest of the world. It is useful to think about this deficit in terms of the current defense budget: it is 35 percent bigger.
Most countries would jump at the chance to get into this kind of fix. But they can't. And if they did get into the habit of consuming more than they produce, they would quickly have to earn their way out -- by consuming less and producing more. No such imperative is yet felt in this country, however. We conveniently finance our deficit with dollars.
Up until now, the rest of the world -- America's creditors -- has been more than happy to exchange its merchandise for our currency, a currency they have coveted both as a medium of exchange and a store of value. So the dollars have made fast round trips, from American consumers to foreign producers and back as investments in America.
The collapse of the American bubble has spurred the Federal Reserve to action. Since Jan. 3, 2001, it has cut the interest rate it directly controls, the federal funds rate, no fewer than 12 times.
And because desperate debts and falling stock prices conjure up the fear of a general decline in wages and prices, the Fed has pledged radical additional action. It has promised, if necessary, to make dollars superabundant -- in effect reducing their purchasing power on purpose. In so many words, it has promised that there will not be no inflation.
In a Nov. 21 speech, Ben S. Bernanke, a Federal Reserve Board governor, tried rhetorical shock therapy. Using a device called a "printing press," he carefully explained, the government can "produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost." 
Many central bankers have had the same thought. Few have dared to say it out loud. Another who did, a month after the Bernanke speech, was none other than Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. If need be, said Mr. Greenspan, the Fed could hammer down long-term bond yields just as it has repeatedly cut short-term interest rates. It did so, in fact, the chairman reminded his audience, between 1942 to 1951, years of war, price controls and national mobilization.
"Unilateralism" in military affairs may be necessary and expedient. But the relationship of a debtor nation to its creditors is necessarily multilateral. This is especially true in the case of a debtor that prints the money with which to service its debts.
Now the debtor, putting the needs of its own economy and financial system first, has promised to do what, pre-bubble, few self-respecting nations did: it has promised to crank up price inflation just a little bit. To reach this goal, the Fed is running the printing presses, buying Treasury securities with credit it creates out of thin air.
The stock market has apparently noticed. Buoyed by war news and easy money, it has strung together eight days of gains, the most since June 1997. But the bond market, too, has noticed. Interest rates have climbed, with the 10-year Treasury note now above 4 percent, up from a low of 3.56 percent only a few days ago. Mortgage rates have followed suit, a shift that imperils the glorious mortgage refinancing boom.
The war didn't cause America's financial and economic problems. But it's not so far-fetched to speculate that it may soon worsen them. Rising interest rates and a rising inflation rate may soothe the anxieties, and the consciences, of the governors of the Federal Reserve Bank. It is unlikely, however, that they will deepen the reservoir of confidence among the legions of America's foreign creditors.

Beyond War News, AOL's Broadband Plan May Face a Struggle

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
America Online had hoped that the Academy Awards ceremony would be a glamorous occasion for kicking off its new service for customers with high-speed, or broadband, connections. So even though the war in Iraq caused Hollywood to scale back some of its usual pomp, AOL officials decided late last week to proceed with plans to begin a splashy new advertising campaign featuring a commercial with Sharon Stone in bed with AOL's "running man" icon. 
 The war does create an opportunity for AOL to show, rather than simply tell, some of what its new service can do. It has a fair bit of video news from ABC and CNN. And it has a host of features, like one that lets family members upload photographs of relatives serving in Iraq. 
 But when the dust settles, AOL appears to have quite a challenge ahead selling its new, largely untested vision of what broadband customers want. A survey by Odyssey, a consumer research firm, indicates that the online public has little interest in AOL's vision of enhanced content. Even worse, their overall opinion of AOL is plummeting. In January, just 23 percent of respondents said they had a "very good" image of AOL's service, down from 39 percent a year earlier. 
Jonathan Miller, who became AOL's chief executive last summer, readily admits that the company needs to reintroduce itself to current and potential customers. AOL built a huge and profitable business as a safe and easy place for people to get their first experience on the Internet. But it is now clear that the company stayed with that positioning too long after the majority of users were no longer novices. 
"People have already decided they know who AOL is, so you have to sound a wake-up call," Mr. Miller said during an interview in his office in Reston, Va., last Thursday. "The AOL brand was perceived as not sophisticated and not necessarily in tune with the times. We need people to realize we are not just the Internet on training wheels but a much more sophisticated, yet still friendly and easy, place to be." 
So Mr. Miller is replacing AOL's long-running, bland and repetitive ad campaign that used the slogan "so easy, no wonder it's No. 1." The new ads, all featuring big-name celebrities, promise more with the slogan "Welcome to the world wide wow." 
Even though most of its customers still use slow dial-up modems, all of AOL's advertising will now promote its fast broadband service. That is partly because AOL is far behind in broadband market share. And talking about a more advanced service also helps the image of the basic offering, Mr. Miller said. 
One big challenge for AOL advertising is that the company cannot simply offer a high-speed version of its traditional Internet access package. It tried for years to persuade the cable and telephone companies to sell it wholesale access to their high-speed networks, to be resold under the AOL name. But it could seldom strike economical deals, and when it did, consumers had little interest.
So, in December, Mr. Miller spelled out a strategy for a version of AOL that would be an add-on for people who already have cable or telephone company broadband service -- an approach known by the shorthand "bring your own access." 
The notion that consumers should buy AOL in addition to another company's broadband service is not only a complex message for consumers but also one that asks them to pay a total of nearly $65 a month for their Internet access. Mr. Miller expressed some satisfaction, however, that Yahoo and the MSN service of Microsoft have said that similar add-on services would be their main broadband focus.
"On December 3, I said that I believed that content mattered, and paying for content matters, and that bring your own access is the way the world may shape up," Mr. Miller said. "For what it's worth, that is now the strategy of record for Yahoo and MSN." 
But the survey by Odyssey shows what an uphill battle these services face. When asked what is important, only 33 percent of the online users said "online service provider's content." More than twice that many cited factors about the performance of online networks -- the speed and quality of the connections and the price of the service. 
"The online service providers are playing a content-centric game, but the things most important to consumers are related to performance and value," said Sean Baenen, Odyssey's managing director. Fast Internet access with few other features is what the cable and telephone companies offer, he said, adding that they have won the bulk of the broadband business. 
Mr. Miller argues that the success of RealOne SuperPass, the $9.95 a month online video service offered by Real Networks, is a sign that some Internet users will pay for content. Real, so far, has attracted 900,000 subscribers to SuperPass and its other services, mainly because of sports and news programming. 
AOL is positioning its service as having every bit as much video content as SuperPass and the new Yahoo Platinum service, besides possessing many other features. 
The new service is called AOL for Broadband and will have a list price of $14.95 a month. But AOL members who switch to it will pay only $9.95 a month through the end of the year. 
In addition to the news feed from ABC, which was just added, AOL has arranged for a variety of other video programming, including outtakes from several reality television shows and game highlights from football, basketball and hockey games. It is still in negotiations over baseball content. Unlike the Real and Yahoo services, AOL does not intend to Webcast entire sporting events.
In addition to video, the latest version of AOL's software, called AOL 8.0 plus, will offer several ways to stop some of the more irritating aspects of Internet life. There is improved filtering for junk e-mail, or spam. There are better ways for parents to keep their children from surfing to undesirable sites or e-mailing strangers. And there is new software to filter for e-mail viruses and to act as a firewall, protecting a computer from external hackers. All these features are available to broadband and narrowband customers. 
AOL is also introducing a new e-mail program, in development for nearly a year, that will give its users some of the more advanced features offered by nearly every other Internet service. It will let users receive their e-mail through AOL as well as work or university accounts in one place and store it in folders on their own hard drives. The service's standard e-mail is stored on the AOL computer for a limited time. This sort of program is meant to appeal to the most advanced 10 or 15 percent of AOL's audience, but these are the customers most likely to switch to broadband accounts. 
"We want to cast a big tent so people don't have to leave AOL to get what they want," Mr. Miller said.

It's prospects for the future seem bleak because fewer consumers have high regard for the service and few seem inclined to pay a higher price for more content, which is what AOL is selling.

Start-Up Finds Technology Slump Works in Its Favor

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 23 

 BODY:
Silicon Valley is continuing to hemorrhage thousands of jobs, but there are some here who say that the time has never been better for creating a start-up company. 
 On Monday, Phil Goldman, whose career as a software designer has included stints at Apple, General Magic, WebTV and Microsoft, will introduce a service that he says will permanently end e-mail spam for consumers who are being driven to distraction by unsolicited pitches for diet schemes and offers of great wealth from Nigeria. 
 Mr. Goldman, 38, who is self-financing his company, Mailblocks, said that the falling cost of new technologies and the slumping technology economy are making it relatively easy to enter new markets. 
"It's incredibly inexpensive to buy computers, and network bandwidth is essentially free and there is surplus equipment," he said. At the same time, innovation has been frozen because Silicon Valley's venture capitalists are largely sitting on the sidelines. 
"It's like a guy crawling in the desert who sees the oasis, but who can't quite get there," he said. 
Mailblocks, based in Los Altos, Calif., is entering the crowded e-mail market with the premise that consumers will pay a small annual fee for a solution to spam. 
The consumer e-mail market is currently dominated by Yahoo, Hotmail and America Online, which provide free basic services that are supported through advertising. 
There are also already dozens of commercial add-in products that try to recognize and block spam. Moreover, Internet service providers in recent months have begun to make new efforts to respond to growing consumer frustration with spam. 
In addition to legislative proposals before Congress and state legislatures, there are efforts under way within the direct marketing industry to try to deal with spam. And last week, the Internet Engineering Taskforce, a committee of technology experts that sets Internet standards, met in San Francisco to listen to proposals for technical solutions to spam. 
The Mailblocks antispam service is based on a so-called challenge-response mechanism to block bulk mail sent automatically to e-mail accounts. When a customer receives a new message from an unknown correspondent, the system will intercept the message and automatically return to the sender a digital image of a seven-digit number and a form to fill out. Once a human being views that number and types it into the form -- demonstrating that he or she is a person and not an automated mass-mailing machine -- the system will forward the e-mail to the intended recipient. 
Analysts who have seen the Mailblocks system are impressed by it, but some said it would be hard for a new entrant to become anything more than a niche player in the e-mail market. The International Data Corporation, a research house, estimates that there are about 700 million electronic mailboxes in the world and that the number will grow to 1.2 billion in 2005. 
"It's a really nice product, and it's pretty easy to use," said Jim Nail, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, a computer and communications industry research firm. "The question is how big a market. Do people want to pay anybody anything for these features?" 
Mr. Goldman said he was trying to imitate the strategy of Google, the dominant Web search engine company, which entered its market late but quickly became the leading service in its field because of its ability to provide more useful Web searches. 
Mailblocks will charge an annual fee of $9.95 for its personal e-mail service, which will give users 12 megabytes of mail storage and 6 megabytes of allowances for attachments. Charter members will receive two additional years of free service. 
Mr. Goldman plans for Mailblocks to offer related services in the future, like personalized domain names, calendaring, contact list management and other personal information functions. 
The idea of a challenge-response system to protect against bulk electronic mail has been familiar to the technology community for several years. A number of programmers, in fact, have developed their own home-brew challenge-response systems, and so have several small companies including Mailcircuit and Frontier. 
Mr. Goldman said he had come upon the idea independently in 2001, only to discover there were already many patents in the area. He contacted the inventor who held the first patent covering the idea and acquired that patent, as well as another in the same field. 
With the depressed job market, Mr. Goldman said it had been easy to find a small team of people who were passionate about building an easy-to-use consumer mail system. The technology trends that are currently driving costs down will make it possible for the new start-up to "be patient" during the period that the business is being built. 
Mailblocks has 15 employees, and Mr. Goldman said he estimated that he would need to add one employee for each million new e-mail customers the company attracts.

HEADLINE: Professor's Rebellion: Teaching Western Books in Iran, and in U.S., Too 

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Azar Nafisi, formerly of Tehran, was struggling to wake up her graduate students. Under discussion was Janie, the itinerant mixed-race heroine of "Their Eyes Were Watching God," written in 1937 by Zora Neale Hurston.
 "Is she a feminist?" one student asked. 
 "Who cares if she is a feminist?" Ms. Nafisi replied. "What makes her interesting is her contradictions." She prodded the class to connect with Janie, who has returned to her small-town home to tell of her adventures. "Janie is in a state of inner exile," she said. "Telling the tale is her way of taking control of the life she had lived. It wasn't death she feared. It was misunderstanding." 
Ms. Nafisi's students, at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies here, appeared interested but a little sleepy. Not quite, she said, the level of intensity she was accustomed to when teaching Western literature in Iran, after the Islamic revolution there, in the 1980's and 90's; nothing like the riot that almost broke out when she gave a talk in Iran on Flaubert and "Madame Bovary" or the time she decided to put "The Great Gatsby" on trial in her classroom at the University of Tehran because her students were so incensed by that novel.
Therein lies Ms. Nafisi's appreciation of contradiction. In Iran she detested the restrictions placed on women, including wearing the veil, and left with her family in 1997. Yet the constraints of a ruling totalitarian theocracy turned banned literature into forbidden fruit and gave teaching undergraduate staples like Jane Austen the panache of leading an underground rebellion.
After quitting her teaching post at the University of Tehran, frustrated by official restrictions, Ms. Nafisi offered a clandestine course in Western classics to students who met in her home. Ms. Nafisi, now 52, has written of her experiences as a professorial partisan in a new book, "Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books," to be published this week by Random House.
Before class, discussing the transition from there to here, she invoked an author: in this case Saul Bellow and his notion of "the sufferings of freedom" (from "More Die of Heartbreak"). For Ms. Nafisi this translates into a cultural complacency in the United States that prizes "Joe Millionaire," neglects reading and encourages people to participate in polls without understanding basic issues. She spoke with good-natured distress of her own son, a high school senior, who receives almost all of his information from television.
But it is an ordeal she is happy to withstand. For 18 years Ms. Nafisi lived a bifurcated existence. In her classes she found that her most fervent Islamic students were the most obsessed with Western pop culture, and that everyone was interested in the Oscars. (Since they celebrated Western movies, they were officially forbidden.)
At home she wore lipstick and jeans, and watched "The Golden Girls" on the family's secret satellite television. (Purchased on the black market, the satellites would sit on terraces, often hidden by laundry.) Outside she was forced to hide beneath a veil, forbidden to lick an ice cream cone in public. On first arriving in the United States she succumbed to the pleasure of the shopping mall and the lure of "Law & Order" and "Seinfeld" (and has incorporated "yada-yada" into her lilting syntax). Now she can wear lipstick to class and does.
"Wherever you go, you find things you don't like and people with fundamentalist thinking," she said. "But here you have the space to criticize. I can write an article against 'Joe Millionaire' or make fun of it or go watch PBS. It is different here because I feel I have other spaces. You can criticize, you can hope to change."
In her Hopkins class Ms. Nafisi may have expressed indifference about Janie's feminism, but she is a vocal advocate of women's rights. Born to secular Muslim parents, she saw her grandmother, who was observant, forced under Reza Shah's regime to remove her veil. Though that government, like that of his son, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was authoritarian, women inclined to modernity prospered. These women included Nezhat Nafisi, her mother, who became a member of Iran's Parliament.
"No wonder when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini came in, the most important thing for him was to change the women's situation," Ms. Nafisi said. "The men in these countries become very scared when women become conscious."
She has always lived a dual life. Like many offspring of prosperous Iranians of the era, she studied abroad, in England and Switzerland. She attended the University of Oklahoma, following the young man she married in Iran on his summer vacation. As it would throughout her life, politics played a role. Her father, Ahmad Nafisi, who became mayor of Tehran in 1961, was jailed in 1963 for insubordination, among other charges. Ms. Nafisi got married, she said, out of general confusion. The minute her father was released from prison, in 1968, she filed for divorce. (She has two children with her current husband, Bijan Naderi, an Iranian born civil engineer.
It is sometimes difficult to reconcile the cheery professor with the stylish haircut and pantsuit with the woman who lived in Tehran during eight years of the Iran-Iraq war. "It was so strange during the war," she said. "As soon as our government would start marching and talk about attacking this nest of imperialist spies, we knew our turn would come. One side would attack; the other would retaliate. There was a bond between us, and the Iraqis because as soon as they were hit, we would expect to be hit."
Mainly she is frustrated by the way governments of the West have conducted diplomacy in the region. "People here have been careless about who they support," she said. "The people here thought you can have economic and political relations, but it doesn't matter if their partners are beheading people in their own countries, or stoning women to death."
She said: "You need to support the democratic forces, to give them hope and to be stricter toward these horrible governments. I'm talking about Saudi Arabia, I'm talking about Egypt, I'm talking about Iran and of Korea of course. You can't use one evil force against another. That is what happened in the Iraq-Iran war. The U.S. used Iraq against Iran not thinking they are creating a monster, but they did."
She found a way to refract the present situation through literature. She said she planned to introduce her students to "My Name Is Red" by Orhan Pamuk, the Turkish author. This novel, set in 16th-century Istanbul, is a murder mystery, but the book encompasses the perceptual gulf between East and West. The characters include a group of miniaturists asked by the sultan to work in the European style, with realism and perspective. They are unnerved, to the point of committing murder.
For Ms. Nafisi, the inability of these characters to change their point of view explains why the United States is so hated by Muslim countries. "Reading that book I realized why in those countries they target culture so much," she said. "It is O.K. with them to have economic relations with the U.S. It is O.K. to have political relations. Where is it not O.K.? In terms of women and in terms of their culture. They're worried that you will come in and change their perspective. That women will look at women in this other part of the world and wonder, 'Why can't I be like that?' "
She continued: "The book is very bloody. The characters are so frightened, so destabilized. For me it explains Osama bin Laden. He is not a poor man. What is in danger is his whole way of being. It is in danger because it is being questioned not just by the West but by people in his own country who look at the West. That's why for him this is a life-and-death struggle. Where else can he go? He either has to change or he has to try and kill you."
For Ms. Nafisi the lessons of literature are not academic. She had not seen her mother, who died recently in Iran, since leaving six years ago, and her father still lives there. "I'll always have longings wherever I go," she said. During the 18 years she lived under Iran's revolutionary regime, she never put up curtains, always ready to flee. Now, Ms. Nafisi said, she often feels a desire simply to see the landscape of her native country. She recalls driving toward the Elborz mountains as a child, dreaming of the world that lay beyond.
Now she has found that world but lost her view of the mountains. She is reminded that life, like literature, serves up painful contradictions. "If you're born in a place with mountains," she said, "you can never get used to the plains." She has hung up curtains, though, just not in every room.

HEADLINE: The Skeptical View of the Economy Takesin More Than Iraq 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
With the battles having begun in Iraq, the United States economy once again looks as if it might be on the cusp of emerging from its torpor. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose more last week than it did during any week since September 2001, and Wall Street forecasters predict that a quick military victory will reduce economic uncertainty, causing a surge of corporate and consumer spending.
 But this has become a familiar refrain. A year and a half ago, many economists said that the country would prosper as soon as it recovered from the Sept. 11 attacks. Early last year, the scandals at Enron, Worldcom and elsewhere were supposed to be all that was preventing a new boom. 
 With each new month of layoffs and other corporate cost-cutting, however, the exceptions begin to look more like a rule. Increasingly, corporate executives and some economists worry that the slow-growth economy of the last three years might in fact be the new reality, one that will bedevil workers and investors for a few more years. 
"When it all comes out, we're going to have a significantly less sanguine outlook than we did in the late 90's," said Dale W. Jorgenson, an economist at Harvard University and an expert in productivity, widely seen as the most important factor for future growth. "That's something we're just going to have to get used to."
Economic turning points rarely announce themselves clearly, and rapid growth might truly be just around the corner this time, thanks to the Federal Reserve's reduction of short-term interest rates, say, or a technology breakthrough yet to be understood. At the least, a victory in Iraq seems likely to cause a spurt of optimism and economic activity.
But there are tangible reasons to doubt that the United States will soon return to the heady times of the late 1990's. The federal budget deficit is rising, and the aging of the population will slow the growth of the labor force. Consumers will probably not increase their spending as rapidly as they did in recent years, and businesses -- having invested so much in the boom years -- still have a lot of idle factories and machinery.
"The effects of the bursting of the stock market bubble have proven to be far more long term and pervasive than expected," William J. McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech on Thursday. He specifically mentioned continuing doubts about corporate accounting and governance as a drag on growth.
The war with Iraq and the occupation that will follow are certain to deepen a budget deficit that without the war would exceed $300 billion next year if President Bush's proposed tax cuts were to become law. Mr. Bush's recent statements about North Korea and the scope of the war on terrorism suggest that other conflicts are possible in coming years.
"The U.S. is going to take on quite an economic cost, whether it's successful militarily and politically or not," said Bob McKee, the chief economist at Independent Strategy, a consulting firm in London for large investors. "Nobody is much prepared to help."
Independent Strategy predicts that the war and its aftermath will cost almost $300 billion from now to 2006. William D. Nordhaus, a Yale economist who has analyzed past conflicts, estimates that the United States will have to spend $75 billion to $500 billion occupying Iraq. 
Most economists think that higher deficits help cause higher long-term interest rates by increasing competition for savings. Higher rates, in turn, would sharply curtail mortgage refinancing and cool a housing industry that has been among the economy's few strengths. Until growth picks up and private demand for investment capital strengthens, few economists expect interest rates to move significantly higher.
Last year, low interest rates and rising home prices permitted households to take out $700 billion from their homes, through sales, refinancings and home equity loans, up from about $400 billion a year in the late 1990's, according to Economy.com. In a speech this month, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, predicted that the pace of extraction would slow, "possibly notably lessening support to household purchases of goods and services." 
Even with mortgage rates still near a three-decade low, the number of houses starting to be built declined 11 percent last month, according to the Census Bureau's seasonally adjusted figures. Cold weather played a role in the decline, but the drop also suggested that after a record surge of house buying in recent years, the number of people looking to buy new homes might not be growing as it once was.
Stocks, meanwhile, remain historically expensive, despite a market correction that recently passed its third birthday. The stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 are trading at a price equal to about 30 times their earnings per share over the last year. At the end of the 1990-91 recession, that multiple was 18.
If stocks grow only modestly in coming years, consumers -- particularly baby boomers, who are approaching retirement -- are likely to increase their saving, at the expense of spending, economists say. Now, households are saving about 4 percent of their incomes, up from 2 percent during the boom but still well below their average of around 8 percent in the 70's, 80's and early 90's, according to the Commerce Department.
Already, car buyers have shown some recent signs of ending their long shopping spree, and Ford and General Motors have announced that they will cut production.
Of course, as the economic pillars of the last couple of years weaken, some rickety parts of the economy will stiffen.
Corporate profits have improved somewhat, and executives will eventually start investing in new equipment and technology again. State governments will not be cutting their budgets forever.
These are reasons that almost no economists think that the United States will fall into a prolonged and deep slump as Japan has. But there is still a great difference between booming and merely avoiding frequent recessions.
Many top executives have focused on this difference, seeing the slow-growth economy as more than a temporary phenomenon. At the end of last year, most chief executives predicted continuing job cuts and economic growth of less than 2 percent this year, according to a survey by the Business Roundtable in Washington. Despite the deep cuts of the last two years, industrial companies are still using just 75 percent of their available capacity, less than they were during most of the 2001 recession.
"This is a period of adjustment," said David A. Daberko, chief executive of the National City Corporation, a bank and large mortgage lender based in Cleveland. "We're going to run higher unemployment. We'll have less growth."
Most Wall Street economists, on the other hand, remain as cheery as ever, saying economic growth will accelerate to 3.6 percent next year, up from 2.6 percent this year, according to Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter that surveys forecasters. But Wall Street has been erroneously predicting a quick return to 3 percent growth since the economy weakened in 2000. 
Most analysts agree that growth must exceed 3 percent for unemployment to fall and wages to rise broadly.
Those who foresee a postwar boom view the uncertainty created by the conflict as the single biggest drag on the economy today. Without it, optimists say, the interest rate reductions and corporate belt-tightening since 2001 would leave both consumers and executives wanting to spend money.
"There's no inventory anywhere. Financing costs are about as low as they're going to get," said Ian Shepherdson, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla. "I think there is a short period where we will see growth go off the charts."
Other economists say that to escape the cycle of miniboom and disappointment that the economy has lurched through since late 2001, Saddam Hussein -- and not the budget deficit, consumer skittishness or the overhang of corporate investment -- would have to be today's biggest economic problem. That might be wishful thinking.
"Even though I've seen a slowdown in the marketplace, I don't think it's been a direct effect of the turmoil in Iraq; it's been a lot of other issues," said Alan L. Boeckmann, the chief executive of the Fluor Corporation, an engineering and construction company. "I've not seen anyone pull back on projects where I could say, 'That was a direct effect of uncertainty over the Iraq war.' " 
Consumers, for their part, typically reduce their spending during or after the first few days of a major news event, partly because many stay home and watch television. But that does not explain the weakening of sales of vehicles, homes and other retail goods in recent months. Sales in all the areas remained strong throughout much of 2002 -- and, as a result, many economists say, are unlikely to boom over the next year.
"The notion that consumers aren't willing to spend because of a military skirmish with Iraq is simply ludicrous, in our opinion," said Richard Yamarone, an economist at Argus Research in New York.
Instead, the slowing of wage growth for most workers to a pace below inflation is leaving people with less money to spend, and the labor market does not appear poised for a quick recovery, he said.
As baby boomers begin retiring, leaving the nation with fewer workers, wages could start to rise rapidly again. Over all, though, the slowing of labor force growth will also slow economic growth, economists warn, restricting the resources that the country has to pay for new investments or wars.
Professor Jorgenson of Harvard estimated that the number of hours worked in the United States grew more than 2 percent a year in the late 90's. In coming years, it will probably grow about 1 percent each year.
"That's a huge bite out of growth," he said. "We're not going to have the 4 percent growth rate we had during the boom."

HEADLINE: Fall in Oil Price Seen as Motivator for Stock Rally 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Politicians and protesters around the world are debating the wisdom of the attack on Iraq. But so far, investors from Tokyo to Frankfurt to New York have had no qualms about the war's impact.
 As markets worldwide open today for the first full week of trading since troops crossed into Iraq, economists say that the war thus far has been generally positive for the global economy, with one major exception, its negative effect on travel and tourism. 
 Stocks around the world soared last week, with the Standard & Poor's 500-index rising 7.5 percent, German markets gaining 10.2 percent, Korea adding 7.3 percent, and Brazil up 3.1 percent. The gains will probably continue when Japanese markets, which were closed Friday for a holiday, open this morning, forecasters said. 
The biggest reason for the optimism comes from the fall in oil prices, which have plunged more than 25 percent in the last 10 days as American and British troops have seized oil fields in southern Iraq. As the confrontation between the United States and Iraq sharpened over the last several months, the price of a barrel of oil jumped from the mid-$20's to almost $40 by early March, putting a serious drag on growth worldwide, economists say. High oil prices are bad for manufacturers and utilities, and particularly painful for airlines, trucking companies and chemical makers.
But on Friday, oil fell to $26.91 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, its lowest level since Dec. 4. If prices stay below $30 a barrel, or even fall further, economies will get an important lift across the industrialized world. The gains may be greatest in Japan and Europe, which import nearly all their oil.
If American and British troops face relatively light resistance on their drive towards Baghdad, markets worldwide could continue to gain, strategists said. The DAX index of German stocks, which has fallen even further than the S.& P. 500 during the bear market that began in 2000, could see a sharp turn higher, said David Abramson, managing editor at BCA Research. Mr. Abramson predicted that the DAX could rise as high as 4,000, a gain of nearly 50 percent from its close Friday of 2,715.06. "The DAX is unloved and an excellent play on oil and euro weakness," Mr. Abramson wrote in a note to investors.
The dollar has risen recently against the Japanese yen and the euro, reversing several months of declines. A stronger dollar makes the United States less competitive against Japan and Europe, helping European and Japanese exporters at the expense of manufacturers in the United States. For Europe and Japan, which have suffered through years of sluggish consumer demand at home and depended heavily on exports to the United States to grow, the rising dollar could help revive flagging growth.
Alexander Muromcew, portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles & Company in San Francisco, which manages $300 million in Japanese stocks, said he believed that the Japanese Nikkei 225 index, which has fallen to a 20-year low four times in the past month, could rally strongly.
"I'm confident that in the next couple of weeks, the market will rise," Mr. Muromcew said. "You've had a huge rally in the U.S. and Europe, and the yen is weakening again."
But the war's effect has not been entirely positive. Last Friday alone, airlines based in the United States announced 8,300 job cuts, and United Airlines, the second-largest United States carrier, which is already operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, has said it could face liquidation if bookings remain weak and it cannot lower its labor costs. If a war drags on, Americans may become even more reluctant to travel, further hurting the tourism industry, which accounted for $380 billion in sales in the United States alone in 2002.
And, of course, if American and British troops suffer significant reversals or the United States or Europe face severe terrorist attacks, investors may take a very different view of the war. A long, bloody conflict could cause businesses and consumers to cut their spending, so that they are not unnecessarily exposed to risk at a time of global uncertainty. Those cuts, in turn, could further slow economies worldwide.
"A short war would reduce the aversion to risk in the global market," said Edward Amadeo, consultant for Tendencias, a research group based in Sao Paulo, Brazil. "But this scenario could be altered drastically if the war is prolonged."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Many marketers stick to their campaigns in weekly newsmagazines despite the onset of war.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
DESPITE concern that the war in Iraq would prompt marketers to cancel their ads from the weekly newsmagazines, much as they did after the events of 9/11, the first days of the invasion have confounded the conventional wisdom. 
 Executives and editors at Newsweek, Time and U.S. News & World Report said that while some marketers postponed ads that were due to run in today's issues -- the first issues since the attack began -- a reassuring number of others like the T.D. Waterhouse Group, GlaxoSmithKline and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company told the magazines to run their ads as planned. 
 "You're going to open the magazine on Monday and see a fair number of ads," said Mark Whitaker, the editor of Newsweek.
Editors and publishers at the magazines would not specify how many ads they had to postpone because of the war, but they said that such requests were fewer than in the days after Sept. 11. Newsweek had just over 30 ad pages in today's issue, down from about 38 pages this time last year, while U.S. News had slightly over 20, compared with more than 35 last year. (An expanded, anniversary issue of Time today had 75 pages of ads.) 
And with marketers like DaimlerChrysler continuing to advertise, albeit cautiously, the magazines' editors and publishers said they were confident that the war in Iraq would not have the long-lasting effect on ad sales that the Sept. 11 attacks did.
Magazine ad pages were already in decline on Sept. 10, 2001, and the terrorist attacks worsened the situation. Now, ad pages are on a modest upswing after a severe downturn. The shock to advertisers in 2001 was even sharper because the years before the attacks were marked by dot-com optimism and Wall Street euphoria, which in turn were reflected in exuberant marketing messages, said Eileen Naughton, the president of Time in New York, part of the Time Inc. division of AOL Time Warner. That tone abruptly became inappropriate.
"Marketers by and large became more sober and less frivolous in their messages since Sept. 11," she said.
As a result, their ads now are less jarring when juxtaposed with news of death and destruction.
In other ways, the Sept. 11 attacks made marketers more battle-ready, said Gregory J. Osberg, the worldwide publisher of Newsweek in Washington, part of the Washington Post Company.
"Since Sept. 11, consumers and marketers have somewhat hardened to periods of conflict like this," Mr. Osberg said. The war and turmoil that followed the attacks have prevented any softening up of attitudes, he said. "The news has not been very positive for the last year and a half."
Many marketers seem to agree that the war with Iraq is different. Much of the impact of the Sept. 11 attacks was their devastating suddenness, said James Kenyon, a spokesman at DaimlerChrysler's offices in Auburn Hills, Mich. The company is not canceling or delaying advertising in newsweeklies or elsewhere. "That was a far more emotionally wrenching experience for the entire country," he said. "We've obviously been prepared for this situation."
Today's issues of the newsweeklies include ads for the Discovery cable network, owned by Discovery Communications; Flonase allergy medicine, from GlaxoSmithKline; Winston cigarettes, made by R. J. Reynolds; the USA Network of Vivendi Universal; the Discover Card unit of Morgan Stanley; and Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored buyer of home mortgages.
But other ads were withheld for later publication at the marketers' request.
"We've decided to pull our advertising from Time and Newsweek for the next couple of weeks," said Kim Custer, a spokesman at Kia Motors America in Irvine, Calif., part of the Kia Motors Corporation. 
Kia executives, who are also postponing commercials during network news coverage, felt that the company's tongue-in-cheek marketing was not appropriate now, Mr. Custer said.
To help deal with such concerns among advertisers, U.S. News & World Report today introduced a separate section without war news in the back of the magazine, called the "2nd Front."
"There are certain categories of advertisers that want nothing to do with mayhem and things of that sort," said Brian Duffy in New York, the editor of U.S. News, which is owned by Mortimer B. Zuckerman. "One of them said that was a very proactive thing to do -- not everyone is looking out for our interests while we're running around with our hair on fire."
Executives at the other magazines have no plans to introduce a similar section.
"We never considered that sort of thing," said James Kelly, the managing editor of Time. "Needless to say, we value our advertisers, but it's one of those things where there's news to cover and we're going to cover the news."
All three major newsweeklies have taken special steps to report on the war. For this issue, U.S. News arranged to push back its normal Friday night deadline to Saturday night, when Newsweek and Time normally close. All three increased print runs, as much as doubling the number of newsstand copies, and prepared contingency plans for special editions in the event of major news -- like the capture of Saddam Hussein -- broke on Sunday or Monday.
"Right now, it looks like this is breaking in a way that works pretty well with our schedule," said Mr. Whitaker at Newsweek, which like its competitors was prepared for the expensive step of delaying its press run if events warranted. "There's an economic cost, but right now this is what we do. We do not stint, when it comes to cost, when we're covering a war."
Not that covering a war hurts readership. The newsmagazines all reported significant increases in the number of copies they sold on newsstands for months after the terrorist attacks.
"We definitely feel good about what it does for our magazine in terms of increased audience levels, and that goes for the whole news media," said William D. Holiber, the publisher of U.S. News.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: RIYADH; 
Saudi Arabia Seems Calm But, Many Say, Is Seething

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, March 23 

 BODY:
With war rumbling beyond its eastern border and violent antiwar demonstrations rocking neighbors to the north and south, many people here wonder how long Saudi Arabia can maintain its eerie calm. 
 "The atmosphere is boiling," declared Mohsen al-Awajy, a tall, angular Islamic scholar, distinguished by a long beard and white head scarf without the usual black headband. He says even his daughters are urging him to join Al Qaeda and follow Osama bin Laden. 
 "Our children are taking this a step further than us because they are affected by the injustice of the war led by the U.S.," he said, adding that he fears the mood could erupt into violence. "The Saudi street is fertile for any action." 
Saudi Arabia's royal family, many of whose most powerful members were educated in the United States, is caught between its longstanding American allies and an increasingly anti-American population deeply opposed to the war. Those tensions have been heightened by the presence of thousands of American troops in the country, including the United States commander of the air war. Though the Saudi government officially denies it, the bombing campaign is being directed from this country -- something that few Saudis realize.
"If people knew that, they'd be in the streets," said a senior Arab diplomat in the capital, calling Saudi Arabia a "volcano" that could blow at any time.
The country's leaders are clearly angry with Washington for risking the region's stability to prosecute what they call an illegitimate war. Saudi Arabia has long urged the United States to put its energy into solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict rather than inflaming passions with an attack on Iraq.
"We worked very hard to prevent it, and we've worked very hard toward having a soft landing after a mistake that is so threatening to the region," Prince Saud, the kingdom's Princeton-educated foreign minister, said in a briefing Saturday.
He said the public's anger was natural and added that if the war was not concluded quickly and its aftermath handled with care, "this anger will continue to mount and continue to expand."
That anger is increasingly evident in the country's newspapers, currently the only available forum for frank public debate. The front page of Saudi Gazette today carried a photo of two British soldiers staring down at the crumpled bodies of two dead Iraqis with a white flag of surrender by their side. Another photo showed the face of a crying, wounded Iraqi child. 
In an open letter to Crown Prince Abdullah, carried in two of the country's largest newspapers, a well-known Saudi lawyer called on the government to lift its restriction on public action against the war.
"It is time for us to move into a new era that will lead the nation from a state of inaction to one of positive confrontation against any aggressor who violates the sovereignty and sanctity of countries and murders our brethren wherever they are," the letter read.
The emotions extend into Saudi Arabia's elite society. Sitting in the hushed lobby of Riyadh's best hotel, a prominent Saudi intellectual received several messages and phone calls on his cellular phone late today from people expressing their support for the Iraqis. 
"Pray seven times for victory against the Americans," read one message, which he said had come from a member of the royal family.
So far the Saudi government has kept its populace calm by referring reassuringly to "brotherly Iraq" and declaring that it will not get involved in the war. An active intelligence agencyhas also rounded up dozens of suspected militants, and armed soldiers keep watch in areas of the city frequented by Westerners.
But the lack of action belies the deep feelings here.
"Of course we don't like the war, but we're not allowed to protest," said Fars Altamimi, 24, sitting in the small living room of his home in a poor neighborhood of Riyadh. He says he believes that the United States has turned against the Arab world.
Mr. Awajy, the scholar, argues that repressing protests is only increasing frustration, particularly among young Islamic extremists.
With the median age in the kingdom 17 and the population growing far faster than the job market, there are plenty of frustrated young Saudis who might turn to action. A slack economy is worsening the situation. 
Many of those bored and jobless youths find solace in religion, creating a huge pool of potential militants. 
"What we are worried about is the growth of extremism under this repression," Mr. Awajy said. "Not giving people a peaceful way of expressing their outrage is creating an explosive situation."
There is no evidence that any organized network has yet coalesced from the widespread political dissent and anti-American sentiment, but Saudis say such an organization could appear quickly.
"The raw materials are available," Mr. Awajy said, adding that weapons were easily acquired across the Yemen border. "We have thousands of youths well trained in explosives in Afghanistan and Chechnya, and now they are here."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: AMMAN; 
Protests Continue as Jordan Defends U.S. Presence in Border Region

BYLINE:  By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, March 23 

 BODY:
On another day of protest here and new images of the war next door, Jordan's prime minister, Ali Abu al-Ragheb, urged a renewed effort today at finding a diplomatic solution to the war in Iraq. 
 "We are witnessing extensive use of force and casualties are increasing tremendously every day," Mr. Ragheb told reporters here tonight. "All efforts should be exerted again to find a solution to the problems and to minimize the damages that have already been big enough. 
 "This war can be devastating," he added. "It will be devastating for Iraq and for the neighboring countries and might draw in new players to the game, which can be dangerous also."
Mr. Ragheb's statements echoed a similar plea issued on Saturday by another of Iraq's neighbors, Saudi Arabia, which has also offered support to the American military despite strong internal opposition to the war. Like Turkey to the north, the two nations are worried about more intense opposition to a war that has deeply angered many of their people, as well as wreak economic and political havoc as happened in the Persian Gulf war in 1991. 
There have been about 60 protests in Jordan since the war in Iraq began last week -- and today the police used water cannons and smoke bombs to quell a large demonstration at the campus of the University of Jordan here in Amman. Students threw stones at the police and burned a sheet painted like an American flag as well as an effigy of President Bush. 
In an apparent indication of just how sensitive the issue of protest and opposition to the war is here, plainclothes police confiscated the videotapes of the protest taken by CBS and Reuters television. 
Mr. Ragheb said confiscating the tapes had been a mistake, and they were later returned. 
While Jordan maintains largely friendly relations with Iraq, its largest trading partner, it has allowed thousands of American Special Forces soldiers in the desert on its eastern border with Iraq, in a role that has grown more contentious in recent days.
Jordan maintains that their role is to operate Patriot antimissile batteries and other roles officials here say are purely defensive.
But Iraqi officials have accused United States forces here of moving into the western desert, amid speculation that Jordan's role in establishing a front in northern Iraq may grow because Turkey has refused to host any American soldiers. Journalists staying near the border have seen military helicopters, American C-130 cargo planes and fighter planes in the area.
Tonight, Mr. Ragheb said none of this indicated that United States forces based in Jordan were operating in Iraq -- and he strongly denied the allegation.
"I can confirm that no activities took place from Jordan into Iraq," he said. 
Mr. Ragheb also announced that five Iraqi diplomats had been told to leave Jordan, though he also denied that this was at the behest of the United States, which has been urging allies to expel Iraqi diplomats. 
"This is strictly a Jordanian and Iraqi issue," he said. 
He declined to say specifically why they were expelled. Two of the Iraqi diplomats, he said, were later permitted to stay.

Omnicom's Rating Is Lowered by Fitch

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
Fitch Ratings has downgraded by one notch the debt ratings for the Omnicom Group in New York, which owns agencies like BBDO Worldwide and DDB Worldwide. With that action, Fitch changed Omnicom's rating outlook to stable from negative. 
 The Omnicom debt ratings were cut on Friday to A- from A for senior unsecured debt and to F2 from F1 for short-term debt. 
 Fitch attributed the downgrading, in part, to "the uncertain state of the domestic economy and the potential effects" of the Iraq war. The rating outlook was upgraded to stable, Fitch said, because of expectations that "cash-flow leverage will improve somewhat from current levels."
The Fitch changes came a week after Standard & Poor's downgraded by one level the long-term and short-term debt of Omnicom.

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
Pataki's Eye Is Wandering to Washington, Critics Say

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 23 

 BODY:
Ever since he was re-elected overwhelmingly to his third term in November, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York has been talking and acting like a politician who has his sights set on Washington, according to strategists and lawmakers in both political parties.
 After campaigning as a social liberal and going out of his way to gain the support of New York's traditional Democratic base, including labor unions and Hispanic voters, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, seems to have made a postelection political shift that has caught the attention of politicians here and in New York. 
 In his words and in his actions, Mr. Pataki has been re-emphasizing his conservative roots, not only taking a hard line against tax increases and government spending -- something his aides say is necessary given the state's dire fiscal condition -- but also anchoring himself to themes that keep him in step with the mainstream of his party. 
In speeches, news briefings and letters to contributors, he has gone on the offensive in the annual Albany budget wars, declaring his opposition to broad-based tax increases because, he says, they drive out jobs -- the same message the Bush administration has adhered to. 
He has also refused to criticize President Bush's proposal to cut federal taxes, even though New York Democrats say the elimination of a tax on dividends would cost New York State millions of dollars. The governor argues that a tax cut on dividends would help bolster the financial-services sector.
At the same time, Mr. Pataki and his advisers have emphasized his anti-tax stance, pointing out that he is among a small number of governors who has not proposed broad-based tax increases to close an enormous gap -- about $11.5 billion for New York.
On another front, he has espoused a second theme embraced by the national Republican Party: Virtually every public event he has held in the last few weeks has been about domestic security and law enforcement.
He has also derided liberals in a recent flurry of letters to supporters; wrote an opinion piece for a newspaper supporting Miguel Estrada, a politically polarizing candidate whom President Bush nominated for a federal judgeship, and held an effusive ceremony in Albany honoring an influential Bush adviser who headed the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which many Democrats said botched the recovery effort in New York after Sept. 11.
He has also refused to put the Bush administration on the spot on issues that he apparently cares deeply about, including acid rain and the Indian Point nuclear power plant.
Most of all, though, his critics point out, the governor has been extremely low-key in appealing for aid from his allies in Washington, even as New York faces the worst fiscal crisis since the Great Depression, sees its economy lag behind the rest of the nation's and bears the ever-growing cost of defending itself against future terrorist attacks.
Democrats, still smarting from the governor's ability to lure away part of their political base, are accusing the governor of putting the state's interests behind his own political ambitions and his concerns for the well-being of the national Republican Party.
"He obviously has no interest in running for re-election in New York, because he's alienating the very same constituencies he courted during the last election," said Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, a Democrat from Manhattan. "He's doing everything he can to ingratiate himself with the Bush administration and burnish his conservative credentials. The question is 'why.' "
Even some of the governor's Republican allies in Albany are beginning to question his motives. "He's auditioning for a job in Washington," said one senior Republican in the State Legislature. "To the degree he pushes for anything, it's behind the scenes. He's not going to publicly pressure the White House."
Mr. Pataki's advisers dismiss the claim that he is angling for a job in Washington, calling it preposterous. They point out he just devoted a great deal of effort to being re-elected, and now has four years to think about what he is going to do next. Meanwhile, they say, he is completely focused on shepherding the state through these difficult times.
Talk of political motives, they said, is just sour grapes from Democrats who are trying to deflect attention from their own inability to achieve much of anything in a Congress they lost in the last election.
They also contend that the governor has a deceptively understated style and has done a great deal through back channels: snagging Governors Island from the federal government, convincing the Bush administration to give New York greater flexibility in how it uses disaster aid, landing the 2004 Republican National Convention for New York City.
There is, they said, no ideological shift on Mr. Pataki's part, noting that he has always been fiscally conservative. And, politically, they said, he has long supported Mr. Bush.
The governor's spokeswoman, Lisa Dewald Stoll, said, "While others criticize, the governor is going to continue to work cooperatively with the Bush administration to ensure New York gets what it deserves. Governor Pataki is not interested in headlines. He is interested in results." And, she said, he is frequently on the phone with senior administration officials, including the homeland security chief, Tom Ridge, pressing the state's case.
The governor's low-key style has been recognized by influential party leaders. "He is loyal and a team player," said Gov. Marc Racicot of Montana, the chairman of the National Republican Committee. "He has been willing to do things for us that are not necessarily glamorous."
But the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, and other Democrats have been saying that all the good will cultivated by the governor is doing no good for New York State, and they have been calling upon him to use his clout to get more federal aid and other support.
"After the governor was re-elected, he determined to become a part of the national Republican Party and moved to the far right," said Mr. Silver, Mr. Pataki's main political rival in Albany. "You have to wonder what his motives are."
Despite such goading, Governor Pataki has not changed his style. Last Friday, appearing on a New York City radio show, he deflected a question about getting additional aid from Washington and instead returned to his preferred theme: that terrorist threats are all around and his first priority is the public's safety, not money.
The governor had responded much the same way a day earlier, at an event in Grand Central Terminal in which he announced heightened security on commuter rail lines to New York City. Asked whether he planned to go to Washington soon to meet with top administration officials to ask for financial assistance, as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, also a Republican, had done a day earlier, he said: "I'm certainly talking to the administration, first of all, about security, and also about the financial consequences" of providing that security. But, he continued, "our priority now is protecting the people of New York City and New York State."
For years, people close to the governor have hinted he has had an interest in running for national office or serving in a high-level position in a Republican administration. Indeed, in recent interviews, people close to him continue to make a case that he is a viable candidate beyond New York, if he ever decides to wade into national politics. 
But the governor's decision to play to a more conservative audience nationally may be hurting him in heavily Democratic New York. A recent poll conducted by Quinnipiac University showed his approval rating had fallen to a seven-year low of 49 percent, down from 62 percent last fall, just before he won re-election.
The true test of whether the governor's play to the right will sell in New York may come soon: top Republicans in New York have been floating the idea that New York may be winnable for President Bush in 2004.
At the very least, say people close to the governor, an all-out Republican effort to make New York appear competitive would unnerve the Democrats and force them to pour more campaign time and money into a state that Democrats have long assumed they could win easily.
By this calculus, Mr. Pataki's stock in the national party would rise instantly, giving him a greater opportunity to land a high-ranking position in a second Bush term, if not a spot on the national ticket as Mr. Bush's running mate.
"I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility," said one prominent New York Republican strategist who is close to the governor. "It would be a tremendous coup for the governor if he could put New York in play."
Mr. Silver said he does not necessarily buy that scenario. But at the same time, he said, most people did not believe that Mr. Pataki could defeat Mario M. Cuomo, a national Democratic icon, in the 1994 race for governor.
"He's always been a dreamer," Mr. Silver said, recalling that Mr. Pataki was an obscure state senator from Peekskill when he toppled Mr. Cuomo. "Don't underestimate the man. He won when nobody thought he could."

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW; 
From China to the American Dream

BYLINE:  By DWIGHT GARNER 

 BODY:
Bill Moyers is probably the most earnest man, and the most prolific television journalist, on the planet. His documentaries and specials roll off the PBS schedule as if from an assembly line, each stamped with the virtues he embodies: they're thoughtful, upright and high-minded and glow with a kind of secular piety. They're both fortifying and numbing, the television version of eating your spinach. He's television's Al Gore.
 Like everyone else who spends a lot of time in front of the camera, Mr. Moyers tends to be as strong as the producers and writers who back him up. In the case of "Becoming American: The Chinese Experience," which will be shown on PBS tonight, tomorrow and Thursday in 90-minute installments, Mr. Moyers (who narrates the program and is credited as a writer) is clearly working with first-rate talent. This is a model documentary that gets almost everything right: it crams nearly two centuries of tangled Chinese-American history into a few engrossing hours while remaining surprisingly light on its feet. 
 One of the earliest images in "Becoming American" is a startling one: a photograph of a Chinese family that, in the mid-19th century, traveled with a P. T. Barnum sideshow along with Tom Thumb and the Tattooed Man. American audiences had conflicting reactions to Barnum's exotic "living Chinese family." Were the Chinese an ancient and wise people or,as some feared, the "debased and cunning" products of a sick society littered with opium dens? These types of uncertain and often blinkered responses would typify Americans' reactions to the Chinese for a long time to come.
Through often haunting archival photographs and interviews with Chinese-American historians, writers and descendants, "Becoming American" does an expert job of penciling in the broad outlines of the Chinese experience here. The documentary moves quickly from the late 1840's -- when thousands of young Chinese men fled flood, famine and civil war at home to find fortune in California's Gold Rush -- to the establishment of the first Chinatowns and the work of Chinese laborers on the transcontinental railroad.
Discrimination against the Chinese in the United States ebbed and flowed during these early years, but labor leaders and politicians would turn them into easy scapegoats during bad economic times. The result was the passage of the federal Exclusion Act of 1882, the first time the United States ever banned a group of people based on nationality or race.
"Becoming American" follows the story through World War II, when the Chinese, who were already at war with Japan, suddenly became the "good Asians," up through the passage of the Immigration Reform Act of 1965, which allowed Asians and other non-Europeans to come to the United States in far greater numbers than ever before.
What you are likely to remember about "Becoming American," however, is less the landmark events than the smaller stories this inquisitive documentary pokes around in. There is the way, for example, that many Chinese men were forced into jobs American men wouldn't accept (running laundries, working as domestic help), which led them to be stereotyped as subservient. Conversely, there is a good deal here about China's patriarchal society and the dated attitudes toward women that many Chinese men brought with them to America.
This documentary also offers incisive miniprofiles of many nearly forgotten players in this long saga. Notable among these is the story of Anna May Wong, a Chinese-American actress who made dozens of films here in the 1920's, 30's and 40's but who was forced to play stock characters -- Mongolian slaves, temptresses, doomed lovers -- and speak "Chinglish" on screen. She was also forbidden to kiss a Western man in a film. ("I must always die in the movies," Wong once said, "so that the white girl with the yellow hair may get the man.") Although Wong was an advocate for Chinese causes in the United States, when she tried to visit China she was denounced as a "stooge of America" because of her screen persona.
"Becoming American" ends not just with a roll call of famous contemporary Chinese-Americans -- Yo-Yo Ma, I. M. Pei, Maya Lin, the Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang among them -- but with revealing interviews with younger Chinese-Americans about the joys and difficulties of trying to become, to greater and lesser degrees, assimilated. One young woman, Michelle Ling, is hilarious about the "fog of guilt" that Chinese-American parents unwittingly spread across their children's lives: the pressure to succeed, to be a "model minority," is enormous. It is as if, she says, you were carrying the entire race on your shoulders.
Ms. Ling's generation has developed some slang for other Chinese-Americans in the 21st century. You can be, she says, an F.O.B. (fresh off the boat), an A.B.C. (American-born Chinese) or even a "twinkie" (yellow on the outside, white on the inside). "Becoming American" offers a smart, panoramic assessment of how it came to pass that today's Chinese-Americans can often feel like all of these at once.

HEADLINE: War a Boon For Outfitters And Trainers 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 24 

 BODY:
For much of the British economy, war in Iraq has brought gloomy news: uncertain prospects of postwar contracts, dwindling income from tourism and airlines, and the ballooning cost of keeping 45,000 troops in battle alongside American forces. 
 But, for one small niche at least, the benefits have been spectacular, an object lesson in what might be termed the gold-rush principle. In the event of a gold strike, that is to say, there is money to be made as much in selling picks and shovels as in digging for gold. 
 In this case, that means equipping and training the hundreds of people sent by the news media to cover the American and British forces in Iraq. 
As war approached, hundreds of correspondents, photographers and camera operators passed through Britain, attending "hostile environment" training courses and buying satellite phones, helmets, chemical warfare suits and respirators. Among them were employees from American television networks, from news agencies like Reuters, and from newspapers, including The New York Times. Similar courses were held in the United States. 
"It's been absolutely fantastic for business," said Tim Simpson, 30, cofounder of Expedition Kit Limited, a privately held company in London that a year ago expanded beyond mountaineering and arctic expedition equipment to begin offering combat gear like protective vests with ceramic bullet-proof plates. The company's sales have quadrupled since the change, Mr. Simpson said.
Similarly, an executive at SatCom Distribution, in Salisbury, Wiltshire, said that sales of satellite phones had increased considerably. 
As wars and risks have multiplied so too has the use of specialized hostile-environment training courses run by companies like AKE Group in Hereford, in western England, and Pilgrims Group in Surrey near London. 
Most courses are meant to teach journalists, humanitarian aid workers and others how to cope in dangerous situations like combat and kidnapping. 
Pilgrims Group says the number of people -- mainly British and American journalists -- attending its courses in the United States and Britain tripled to 150 in February, with each participant paying some $3,200 for a six-day course.
At another specialist company, Centurion Risk Assessment Services, business has doubled in the last year, said Paul Rees, a former British Royal Marine who set up Centurion in 1995. 
"It's been hectic since September 2002," Mr. Rees said. The company's five-day hostile-environment courses, at $2,500 a person, are booked through the end of April, he said.
Like others in this burgeoning business, Mr. Rees declined to discuss revenue or profits. But he said that it costs the company roughly $250,000 a month to run the courses, including salaries for 10 to 14 ex-military instructors and the "pyrotechnics" the company uses to make the courses as realistic as possible. Shorter courses train attendees to cope with nuclear, biological and chemical attacks. 
In February, Mr. Rees said, 260 people enrolled for the courses, twice as many as a year earlier.
Centurion has also sent 15 representatives to Iraq, Jordan and other countries as advisers to television crews. The cost of hiring them has added to the strain on TV news budgets that some executives now worry will run short. 
The cost of sending each reporter, crew member or photographer on an assignment to the war zone may include at least $2,500 for a training course, from $950 to $1,600 for a satellite phone, up to $1,900 for basic protective clothing, and more for chemical warfare suits, respirators, decontamination kits and various medications. 
"And on the back of doing the security equipment for journalists," said Mr. Simpson of Expedition Kit Limited, "the crews are all buying sleeping bags, camp beds, water purifying systems."
It all adds up to a miniboom, one that stands in sharp contrast to other recent economic portents. 
Though the British stock market followed Wall Street's surge last week, it fell back by 3 percent today, and is off more than 7 percent for the year. Tour operators say the number of foreign visitors, particularly Americans, is already down from past years, adding to the slowdown. 
And the war is expected to have less favorable long-term consequences: Gordon Brown, the British chancellor of the exchequer, has budgeted about $2.7 billion to cover Britain's cost for the war, but economists say the final figure could run to twice that, adding to an already worrisome government deficit. 
British companies are pushing to win a slice of the postwar reconstruction work in Iraq that would be commensurate with Britain's military contribution. 
Patricia Hewitt, the trade and industry minister, is reported to have telephoned Andrew Natsios, the administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, last week to press the case of British companies. 
So far, though, no luck. Peter Smith, a spokesman for Peninsular and Oriental Navigation, a shipping company in London, said today that his company had lost out in the bidding for a contract to run the container terminal facility at the southern Iraqi port of Umm Qasr, which American and British troops have been working to secure. The winner, he said, was an unidentified American company.
There have also been other losers. 
In one grim sense, the business of selling protection to news crews is driven as much by the experience of past disasters as by a desire to reduce risks of combat coverage now. After seeing a rising number of casualties among journalists in trouble spots like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sierra Leone and Somalia, many news organizations are leery of risking any more, a news-agency executive said, even as 24-hour satellite technology has pushed the competitive pressures among journalists to new highs. 
The risks were all too clear last weekend when a British television reporter, Terry Lloyd, came under sustained gunfire while on assignment in the port city of Basra in southern Iraq. 
"In an ambush like that," said Mr. Rees of Centurion, "the people who manage to get out are the lucky ones.

HEADLINE: Experts See Gains and Gaps In Planning for Terror Attack 

BYLINE:  By DENISE GRADY and LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

 BODY:
With war under way and the government warning that America is at high risk of terrorist attacks with chemicals, germs or radiation, experts say the nation's response capacity is greater than it was in the past, but still has significant gaps.
 "We're better off than we were, but we're not there yet," Dr. William Schaffner said last week. He is chairman of the preventive medicine department at Vanderbilt University and one of the infectious disease experts who have advised the government about smallpox vaccination. 
 Dr. Tara O'Toole, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies, said: "We have done some useful things, as a nation and in states and some cities, to prepare for a bioterror attack. But I think people don't appreciate the kind of scale of effort that is needed and has not been achieved. I think there is also an understandable reluctance to talk truthfully about how vulnerable we are, lest we encourage would-be terrorists and undermine our own defense. I don't think we're a lot less vulnerable now than we were in 2001." 
But Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said her agency had markedly increased its preparedness level since Sept. 11.
"We are ready to go if we have to step forward for a terrorism event," Dr. Gerberding said. 
As evidence,she cited the disease centers' ability to respond rapidly to severe acute respiratory syndrome, the mysterious illness that has affected hundreds of people in Asia and elsewhere. She said dealing with the SARS outbreak required skills much like those needed to respond to a terrorist attack.
"Within the first 24 hours we had calls to the state health officers and clinician community," Dr. Gerberding said, adding that the C.D.C. had also tapped a team of medical experts to advise about treatment. Within 36 hours the agency had issued guidelines on isolating patients to prevent the spread of the disease, she said. 
In 2001, the agency was severely criticized for not providing crucial information about anthrax to the public promptly. Dr. Gerberding said that since then the disease centers had "taken giant steps in streamlining our capacity to communicate information to the public."
She added, "If you watched the response to anthrax, then West Nile and now SARS, any observer could not help but notice that there has been a dramatic improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness in what we are doing on the communications and scientific front."
Since Sept. 11 the agency has also offered doctors training materials to sharpen their ability to recognize anthrax and other unusual infections. Health experts cited other advances as well, including the computer systems now used in many communities to flag odd patterns of illness or medicine use. In addition, hospitals have retooled their disaster plans. The United States now has enough smallpox vaccine to inoculate the entire population, and, Dr. O'Toole said, vaccinating military personnel and health workers has helped doctors learn how to conduct immunization programs.
The government has also stockpiled antibiotics, treatments for burn and blast victims, and antidotes to chemical weapons and nerve gases. A federal program called the Strategic National Stockpile, part of the Department of Homeland Security, says it has enough medicine to treat 12 million people exposed to anthrax, 100 million exposed to plague and 50 million exposed to tularemia, a bacterial infection. The program says it can deliver the drugs anywhere in the country in 12 hours or less.
But there is still a way to go. For instance, it is not clear whether states are equipped to get the emergency medicine to people who need it. 
"It may be so near and yet so far," Dr. Schaffner of Vanderbilt said. "I'm sure every state health department is wrestling with how you can dispense this medication quickly."
Dr. Gerberding said there was "a lot of work to do to bring every jurisdiction to the same level of preparedness." Some states and cities have been working on responses to bioterrorism for a long time, while others started only recently, using federal money given for that purpose.
The government has asked health care workers to volunteer to be vaccinated against smallpox, to create a pool of professionals to vaccinate others and treat cases in an attack, but far fewer workers than expected have volunteered. Many expressed concerns about health risks from the vaccine and about the lack of compensation for people who missed work or were harmed by side effects. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is considering legislation to compensate injured workers, but Democrats and Republicans have not agreed on the details.
By March 14, only 21,698 health workers had been inoculated.
"It is not ideal, and we have a ways to go before I feel we have achieved the full preparedness we need," Dr. Gerberding said.
She said progress had been made in improving the country's preparedness for a chemical attack. But, she added, "there is no antidote to so many of the chemical terrorism threats." Scientists must develop antidotes, she said, "because it is likely that those chemicals could be the weapons of choice for domestic terrorism."
"C.D.C. is putting out a lot of information about chemical attacks, because we know that clinicians have extremely limited experience dealing with those types of situations," Dr. Gerberding said.
The agency provides information on bioterrorism on its Web site, www.bt.cdc.gov.
Another weak point is the lack of treatments for some potential germ weapons. In addition, disaster plans that look good on paper need to be tested, but drills are hard to conduct when so many hospitals have no staff members to spare and are filled, often with a high proportion of severely ill patients.
And the drills that have been conducted may not have been realistic enough. James D. Bentley, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, said: "The problem is, we tend to organize these drills in a way I'll call nondisruptive drills, on Saturday morning, with off-shift nurses and firemen. We haven't done many in this country where at 2 o'clock in the afternoon Mayor Bloomberg goes out there and stages something that will really disrupt the Bronx or Brooklyn. If there is a real terrorist incident, we'll have to do that. It's those kind of drills that I think the preparedness community wishes we could do more of."
More scientists are also needed. In a letter this month to Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, Dr. D. A. Henderson, who led the vaccination campaign that rid the world of smallpox and has been advising the government on preparedness, said, "We have recruited an outstanding team, but we all recognize that it is still substantially below the numbers needed."
In an interview, Dr. Henderson said that the recently created Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness, which has about 45 employees, needed to double its staff. He also said the office, in the Department of Health and Human Services, needed mature researchers and public health workers with experience in investigating outbreaks and conducting vaccination programs.
"It is very difficult to find those people, and it is very cumbersome to bring in people on short order," he said. "You need people with stature and with a tough shell. They include people who know vaccines, drugs, epidemiology and diagnostics."
Dr. O'Toole of Johns Hopkins also said it was hard to find people with the right training, and hard for states in particular to pay them.
"In September 2001, Maryland had one full-time bioterror person," she said, and when the attacks created a need for more, it was hard to find qualified people. 
"For a generation, we have failed to move the best and brightest of medical and graduate students into government positions," Dr. O'Toole said. "And now we have something like 48 states in recession, and hiring freezes in many as a consequence, and health departments in dire straits."
Washington has provided more than $900 million to states for bioterror preparedness, but experts say more will be needed.
"The longer things go on, the more resources will be necessary," Dr. Schaffner said. "I know health departments, local and state, are already looking ahead, and they do not see sustained support, and they're already worried about that."
Public health experts say society simply cannot allow itself to imagine that the anthrax attack of 2001was a one-time event.
"I think a bioterror attack is a real possibility," Dr. O'Toole said. "It's not a far-fetched, imaginary scenario. It's already been done. Someone made high-grade anthrax and disseminated it. Someone can make more."

HEADLINE: U.S. Disfavor Drains Turkish Economy 

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS Jr. 

 BODY:
When Turkey and the United States failed to finalize a deal last week to send ground forces through Turkey into Iraq, American war planners were inconvenienced, but the Turkish financial markets were devastated.
 The Istanbul Stock Exchange has fallen by a quarter from its February high and is approaching an all-time low. The country's benchmark eurobonds are trading at 87.82 cents on the dollar, down 19 percent in a week. Rumors are swirling that the government is nearing default on its domestic debt. 
 Investing in Turkey has always been a roller coaster ride. The realities of high inflation rates, yawning budget deficits and impenetrable politics have been mitigated, at times, by rapid economic growth and a roster of globally competitive companies. 
Seasoned emerging-market investors have generally been willing to stomach the ride because of a belief that no matter how bad things became, Turkey would never be allowed to fail: the United States would always come to the rescue of so important a strategic ally.
But when the Turkish Parliament rejected the proposal by the ruling Justice and Development Party to accept American ground troops in return for $30 billion in guaranteed credits, that faith was deeply dented.
The possibility that the United States would walk away from Turkey was suddenly a nightmare to consider. "I think relations between the U.S and Turkey have been harmed tremendously," said Mehmet Kutman, the chairman of Global Securities, one of Turkey's larger brokerage houses. "People have lost their confidence, and unless some new money comes in, Turkey could well announce a moratorium on its domestic debt."
During a three-week span in November, foreign investors injected over $2 billion into the Turkish markets on the assumption that the newly elected Justice and Development Party would be in a strong position to negotiate aid from the United States as part of a deal on Iraq.
The Istanbul Stock Exchange shot up on the prospect of billions of dollars in cheap foreign credits being made available to Turkey and the expectation that more private money would follow. Underpinning the optimism was the sense that Turkey's status as America's chief strategic partner in the region would attract even more bounty in the future, like fresh credits from the International Monetary Fund and perhaps even entry into the European Union.
Yes, many investors reasoned, there were short-term risks, including economic harm from the war, but the long-term benefits would be great.
This enthusiasm overlooked what proved to be a crucial factor: Turkey's new government had the largest parliamentary majority in years, but the ruling party itself was something of a paper tiger, a recently assembled collection of conservative Islamist politicians that had never governed in Turkey and had virtually no experience on the world stage.
It did not even start with a genuine prime minister. Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the party, had been barred from holding public office, a ban that has since been lifted.
As a result, the new government proved unable to push the deal with the United States through the fractious Turkish Parliament, and was left looking ineffectual both domestically and internationally.
Mr. Erdogan is now the prime minister, but with hostilities underway in Iraq, and Turkey mainly on the sidelines, he heads a government in disarray. It has infuriated two powerful constituencies, the Bush administration and the ultimate arbiter of Turkish politics, the country's powerful military. 
After the 1991 Gulf war, the Turkish economy fell immediately into a recession, but it kept the good will of the United States because of the unflinching support that Turgut Ozal, Turkey's prime minister at the time, showed for the campaign to oust Iraqi invaders from Kuwait. 
Now, at least for the moment, that good will has evaporated. And with the Turkish military eager to send its troops into northern Iraq, Turkish and United States interests are now more at odds than converging. 
"The basis of the Turkish-American relationship was always strategic, not geographic or cultural," said Bulent Aliriza, a Turkey analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "That was fine and dandy during the cold war. Now, if you take strategy out of the relationship, there is nothing left except the verdict of the market."
That verdict has been a harsh one. With the erosion of the "strategic premium" on Turkish financial assets, the spread between Turkish bonds and United States Treasury bonds has widened to 10 percentage points, and Turkish domestic interest rates have soared.
With no new flood of aid from the United States and with the international debt markets unfriendly as well, Turkey has no way to finance its budget deficit -- largely created by interest costs on borrowings -- other than to try to borrow again from the tapped-out domestic debt market. Foreign investors have pulled out of this market, Turkish brokers say.
"Due to inflation-adjusted interest rates of 35 percent, the debt-to-gross domestic-product ratio will increase," said Berna Bayazitoglu, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Istanbul. "If rates continue at these levels, the ratings agencies might downgrade Turkish debt."
The combination of a domestic default and a possible run on the currency could lead to a broader financial collapse, analysts say. 
The Turkish government is in talks with the International Monetary Fund for an infusion of cash that it badly needs. To get the money, the government must meet certain fiscal goals. Analysts in Turkey expect them to be met this year, but big questions loom, especially taking into account the cost of stepped up military operations on the Iraq border and, perhaps, beyond it.
Meanwhile, Turkey is down to the last $3.5 billion in credits under the existing agreement with the monetary fund, making it look vulnerable to a speculative run unless a new deal is struck. 
As the largest investor in the fund, the United States has historically been a supportive voice for Turkey. How enthusiastic the Bush administration will be now remains a question mark, analysts say.
If the Turkish financial markets were to implode, other emerging and developed markets would be only minimally affected, investors say. Unlike Mexico in 1994, Thailand in 1997, or Russia in 1998, Turkey now has relatively little exposure to foreign investors.
More important are the geopolitical consequences. While there are few signs yet in Turkey of Argentina-style social upheaval, analysts do not discount the possibility of social tensions boiling over in the coming months.
"If winning the war in Iraq sends Turkey into a spiral, that is a huge price to pay for overthrowing the regime in Baghdad," said Philip Gordon, a Turkey expert and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

CORRECTION-DATE: April 3, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in World Business on March 25 about the effect of United States relations on the Turkish economy gave an incomplete summary of the views of Mehmet Kutman, chairman of a large brokerage house, on the future of the nation's domestic debt. While he discussed several possible outcomes, including a moratorium on payments, he said that a debt swap or voluntary restructuring, similar to one in June 2001, was more likely.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: ECONOMIC ANALYSIS; 
War in Iraq Could Bring U.S. Recession, or Economic Growth

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
Depending on the outcome of the war in Iraq, its impact on the economy could range from a recession to a mild stimulant.
 The early indications for the economy, as for the war, had been good. Yesterday, however, a touch of trepidation dampened the mood. 
 "On Friday, when everyone went home for the weekend, there was a degree of euphoria," said Henry G. Willmore, the chief United States economist at Barclays Capital. "There's been a bit of reassessment given the events over the weekend." Yet he added that since a week ago last night, when President Bush announced the 48-hour deadline for Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq, "we've still had significant declines in oil prices and the stock market is up." 
For months, expert studies have predicted that a brisk campaign followed by total victory would lead to lower oil prices and increased consumer confidence. In addition, the removal of uncertainty could help some businesses to make investment decisions. Even in the best case, though, some side effects -- from higher mortgage rates to deepening government deficits -- could shave off part of the economy's gains.
That best case would help to offset what has so far been a disappointing first quarter. Before the first Tomahawk missile was launched, the uncertainty that preceded the war had already taken a toll.
"In terms of growth in the first half of the year, we're going to be somewhere in the vicinity of 2 percent" at an annual rate, predicted Peter Hooper, the chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. Without the war-related uncertainty, he said, the economy might have expanded at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first half.
Economists generally agree that the economy needs to grow by at least 3 percent annually in order to improve employment. With growth of just 2 percent, hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost in a year.
In addition to the stagnating effects of uncertainty, worries about disruptions of oil shipments from the Persian Gulf caused oil prices to rise in the months leading up to the war, putting further pressure on the economy. The strike in Venezuela's oil industry, which has reduced global supply, and now problems in Nigeria make isolating the war's effect on prices difficult.
Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, said that he had heard figures of a $7- to $10-a-barrel price rise in the first quarter of this year. An increase of $10, he said, would cost American consumers about $50 billion a year. Still, he cautioned, "you don't have any really good sense of where the baseline was."
In the first few days of the war, the premium in oil prices had seemed to be vanishing -- dropping by Friday to under $27 a barrel from a peak of $39.99 during New York trading on Feb. 27. If that trend held, the war's indirect impact on the economy could be minimal, according to a study by William D. Nordhaus, a professor of economics at Yale. And yet, yesterday, as it appeared that Iraqi resistance might be stiffening, oil prices rose.
In the worst case, a price spike could cost the United States as much as $391 billion over 10 years, Professor Nordhaus wrote. The Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington forecast that a prolonged war accompanied by serious terrorist attacks could drain $472 billion from the gross domestic product in this yearalone, or 4.5 percent. A loss of that magnitude could qualify as another recession.
On the other hand, a successful conclusion to the United States-led invasion could give the economy an immediate shot in the arm for the second half of the year. A report published in November by the center suggested that the economy could gain an extra $52 billion in growth in the best case.
"If we get through this without major damage to Iraqi oil facilities, and without any kind of terrorist action, and relatively quickly on the military front, I would think that would be good for the economy," Mr. Hooper of Deutsche Bank Securities said. "It would be good for the equity market, and it would be good for consumer confidence."
In terms of companies' actions, Mr. Willmore of Barclays said, "quite a few of them have probably postponed making some decisions, so in effect you don't get the investment and the hiring that might be taking place."
Even while euphoria swept the stock market last week, not all of the war's immediate effects on the economy were positive. Since the White House signaled that diplomatic efforts to avert war had run their course, a sell-off in the bond market had been driving yields higher and putting upward pressure on mortgage rates. The bond market did rally yesterday as stocks plunged, but 10-year Treasury yields stayed 0.4 percentage point above the 44-year low reached on March 10.
The direct cost of the war to the federal government, which the White House estimated yesterday at $70 billion to $90 billion, could also hurt the economy, according to some experts. Swelling budget deficits and greater borrowing by the government, they argue, could push up long-term interest rates.
"Those who are writing the federal budget, to be prudent, must factor this in with everything else that they're doing," including fresh tax cuts and a prescription drug benefit for Medicare, said Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a fiscal watchdog group in Washington. 
Despite these potential drags, Mr. Willmore said he expected the economy to manage reasonable growth of 3 percent this year, with money from refinancing of mortgages and the tax cuts in the new budget helping to support consumers' spending.
The economy could also benefit to the extent, albeit unknowable, that the war diminishes threats to national security. But in the last few months experts have argued conversely that the war could actually increase the likelihood of terrorist attacks.
In either case, Mr. Hooper warned that the overall outlook was still unclear.
Even "if Iraq is resolved successfully," he said, "there are other potential geopolitical clouds on the horizon."

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup; 
Opponents Lose Challenge to Government's Broader Use of Wiretaps to Fight Terrorism

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24 

 BODY:
An effort by a coalition of civil liberties groups to bring a Supreme Court challenge to the government's use of expanded surveillance authority under a post-Sept. 11 statute failed today. The justices, without comment, refused to permit the groups to file an appeal from a ruling by a special federal appeals court that the USA Patriot Act granted broad new authority to use wiretaps obtained for intelligence operations to prosecute terrorists.
 The American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and two Arab-American groups needed the court's permission to file their appeal because under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the 1978 law that set up a special court system for reviewing intelligence wiretap requests, the government is the only party and only the government can file a Supreme Court appeal. 
 The decision last November by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, a court composed of three federal judges who ordinarily sit on other federal appeals courts, was the first ruling that court had issued in its 25 years of existence. The review court permitted the A.C.L.U. and the defense lawyers to file briefs as "friends of the court," but the United States was the only party. 
The case that produced the November ruling was a government appeal of a decision by the lower court in this special system, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court, which had rejected the broad interpretation that Attorney General John Ashcroft claimed for the USA Patriot Act. The 11 judges of that court made their ruling in secret last May, with the decision remaining unknown to the public until Congress released it three months later.
In their petition to the Supreme Court, the civil liberties union and the other groups told the justices that the important issues coming before these special courts "should not be finally adjudicated by courts that sit in secret, do not ordinarily publish their decisions, and allow only the government to appear before them." 
The petition argued that the review court had misinterpreted the USA Patriot Act to permit foreign intelligence wiretaps to be used for law enforcement purposes. If that interpretation of the statute was correct, the petition said, then the law itself was unconstitutional under both the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech and the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches.
The other groups joining the petition were the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services.
The government did not file a response to the groups' petition. Attorney General Ashcroft said today that he was "pleased the Supreme Court declined to consider a challenge of the government's lawful actions to detect and prevent international terrorism and espionage within our borders."
Last November, Mr. Ashcroft declared the review court's decision in the government's favor "a giant step forward" and said it "revolutionizes our ability to investigate terrorists and prosecute terrorist acts."
Ann Beeson, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who filed the petition, acknowledged that the case had been a long shot but said that it was "very important to keep these issues in the public debate."
While defendants who are prosecuted on the basis of intelligence wiretap evidence may be able to challenge the use of the evidence, Ms. Beeson said the civil liberties groups' central concern was for those "innocent targets" who, under the law, may never find out that they had been the object of surveillance.
Congress is considering several proposals to bring the activities of the special courts under closer supervision.
These were among the other developments at the court today.

Car Search
Accepting an appeal by the State of Maryland, the court agreed to decide whether the police can arrest all the occupants of a car when a search turns up drugs or contraband for which all the occupants deny responsibility.
Twenty other states joined Maryland's appeal of a 4-to-3 ruling by the Maryland Court of Appeals overturning the conviction of Joseph J. Pringle, a passenger in a car that was stopped for speeding. The officer searched the car after seeing a large roll of bills in the glove compartment that the driver opened to find his registration. Mr. Pringle eventually confessed to ownership of the money and the cocaine that was also found in the car.
"Simply stated, a policy of arresting everyone until somebody confesses is constitutionally unacceptable," the Maryland appeals court said.
In its appeal, Maryland v. Pringle, No. 02-809, the state argues that whether probable cause exists to arrest all the occupants of a car in a similar situation depends on "the totality of the circumstances" and should not be subject to a hard and fast rule.

Elections Fund
Without comment, the court turned down a First Amendment challenge to an Arizona campaign finance law that created a "clean elections fund," supported by a surcharge of 10 percent on civil and criminal fines collected in the state.
The law was challenged by a state legislator, Steve May, who received a $27 parking ticket and refused to pay the $2.70 surcharge. He refused to accept public financing for his own campaigns and said he did not want to be forced to pay for the campaigns of others, including his opponents.
The Arizona Supreme Court upheld the law last October, ruling that because the law operated in a "viewpoint neutral" manner, it was not an unconstitutional compulsion of speech but in fact had the effect of expanding free speech. But the Institute for Justice, the libertarian group that filed Mr. May's appeal, said the law transformed the act of contributing to political campaigns from one of "individual volition into an act of compulsion." The case was May v. Brewer, No. 02-1065.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Help Mexico's Trade 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 24 

 BODY:
High oil prices pushed Mexico's trade balance into a surplus for the first time since June 1997, the finance ministry said today, reporting a $65 million surplus for February. 
 Mexico exported $1.66 billion in crude oil and other petroleum products in February, an increase of more than 100 percent over February 2002. 
The average price for Mexican crude reached $27.96 a barrel in February, an increase of $11.86 over last February. Overall, exports grew 8.6 percent over last year. 
 But exports of manufactured goods, which represent 83.4 percent of Mexico's exports, grew by only 1.1 percent because of the stagnant United States economy. The United States buys more than 90 percent of Mexico's exports and ran a $37.2 billion trade deficit with Mexico last year, according to the United States Department of Commerce.
Imports grew more slowly -- just 2.6 percent -- the finance ministry said, because of Mexico's stagnant economy.

HEADLINE: Retailers Adjust Reluctantly To Era of Permanent Discounts 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
If it's not marked down, America's shoppers are telling merchants to forget it.
 America's clothing stores, from luxury boutiques to the chain department stores, traditionally bring out their new spring merchandise at this time -- displayed at full price. But many, like Talbots, have just put sale signs in their windows. A banner in the window of the chain's East 72nd Street store blares, "25 to 50 percent off." 
 Fewer shoppers are interested, analysts say, because they have become accustomed to bargains -- discounts that are further eroding retailers' profits in an already lackluster retail environment.
"The motto today is if it's not 40 percent off, they don't want it," said Marshal Cohen, an executive with NPD Research, which polls consumers and advises stores.
Bored customers and an uncertain economy have already driven down prices in the last three months. Prices for men's, boys' and infants' clothing in February were 3.9 percent lower than they were a year before; the cost of women's and girls' clothes was down 2.5 percent. Retailers, already in a crisis mode, are now being pressured to cut prices further in an effort to draw people into their stores. "Our Classic Midseason Sale," announced Talbots.
This weekend, there were dueling sale signs in America's malls. In Clinton, Conn., windows at the mall were plastered with boasts about prices: at Tommy Hilfiger, selected clothes were $4.99 to $14.99. Izod was asking customers to "take an extra 50 percent off" already reduced clearance items. Next door, Van Heusen's windows exclaimed 60 percent off. G. H. Bass was giving an extra 50 percent off -- and another $5 on top of that -- often on merchandise first marked down before Christmas.
Retail executives say privately that they worry that the price cutting will continue even after the war ends. Retailers were saved from disaster last year because they were buying the clothes cheaply from factories in China or other parts of Asia, where owners had overbuilt.
Now, industry experts say the prices retailers and manufacturers pay may be creeping up. Oil prices are soaring and the dollar started weakening in December -- although it has improved in the last two weeks -- making imports more expensive. As a result, America's clothing dealers are being squeezed at both ends. The cost of imported fabric alone is expected to rise by at least 5 percent this year, analysts say. 
In a retail boom, retailers would pass along the price increase to consumers. But shoppers have it clear: they are not paying more.
"Passing through price increases is very difficult right now," said Margaret Mager, a retail analyst with Goldman, Sachs. The downward pressure on apparel prices, she said, is caused by excess supply globally -- and the intense competition in the United States. "Then again, there is no important fashion -- nothing grabs the consumer," she added.
Even buying through American sources is becoming more expensive. In early March, several American manufacturers of polyester said that increased oil prices -- petroleum derivatives are used to make synthetic fabrics -- had resulted in significant price increases, with one North Carolina manufacturer, Wellman Inc., raising prices 11 to 14 percent, starting in April -- following a large increase in March. 
"Retail's a brutal business -- and its very tough right now," said Jay McIntosh, a retail analyst with Ernst & Young. "There's been a dramatic decline in price. A huge problem for retailers is that consumers are addicted to promotional pricing right now."
In a conference call with analysts earlier this month, Brad Martin, the chairman of Saks Inc., said that Saks had "clearly operated in a deflationary environment in 2002," and said he did not "see any material change in that in '03 in our outlook."
Mr. Martin said that depending on "one's merchandise mix and sourcing," a prediction of further declines of 3 to 5 percent in store sales -- across the board for all apparel retailers -- was "probably a good proxy." He estimated that sales for 2003, compared store-for-store with sales in 2002, would decline by "low single digit" percentages.
Some retailers may make it -- and others may not. Last week, Spiegel Inc., which owns not only the famous catalog but Eddie Bauer as well, filed for bankruptcy protection. Today's Man filed on March 4, a month after "temporarily" laying off its chief executive. And analysts say several other retail chains, like teen merchant DELiA's, are in trouble. 
Department stores have been particularly hard hit as they try to compete with chain stores like Wal-Mart and Target, which have recently improved their clothing offerings. And it's not just clothing: the price of computers in February fell 19.7 percent compared with a year ago.
But some other retailers -- exceptions to the general retail decline -- still manage to prosper. A few of the so-called niche players, like Chico's and Pacific Sunwear, specialty chains that cater to frighteningly fickle teenagers, have scored in sales and profits. Juicy Couture, another youth-oriented business, is about to be bought by Liz Claiborne, a company that has made acquisitions its byword in the past five years.
Jos. A. Banks, which offers men's clothing in three different tiers of luxury, is also booming; its chief executive has instituted an array of changes, including thank you notes to those who buy. Then there is Wal-Mart, which just keeps going, cutting prices and stealing customers from the competition.
"Companies like Wal-Mart, Target and Costco will continue to put pressure on the margins; they're so flexible, they can keep lowering prices while so many other companies are suffering," said Todd D. Slater, a retail analyst at Lazard.
So Wal-Mart keeps lowering its prices.
But -- surprise -- so does Hermes, the super-stylish French silk and saddle leather merchant.
Hermes has reduced the price of its famous silk ties, a salesman from the Manhattan store said yesterday. "So many people used to go to France to buy them, instead of buying them from us," he said.
The New York City sales tax used to be added, bringing the old $110 price close to $120. But now clothes under $110 aren't taxable, so the consumer pays a mere $108 total.
"They've gotten so much cheaper," the salesman said.

HEADLINE: Government May Alter Line Between a CarAnd a Truck

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 24 

 BODY:
As it develops a plan to overhaul federal fuel economy standards, the Bush administration is weighing proposals that could redraw the line between what the government considers a car and what it defines as a light truck, an official said today.
 The definition is important -- and politically charged -- because regulations let vehicles classified as light trucks use far more gas than do passenger cars. 
 Environmental groups have long complained that automakers give some vehicles trucklike attributes -- like the seats in Chrysler's PT Cruiser, which fold flat to create a truck bed -- so they will qualify for the more lax light-truck fuel economy standards. 
But the first glimpses of the administration's plans also worry environmental advocates, who say details not yet disclosed will determine if new rules end up improving overall fuel economy. 
According to the administration official, who insisted upon anonymity, one possibility being considered is that some vehicles now considered cars for fuel-economy purposes, like station wagons, would be defined as light trucks, while some vehicles now called light trucks -- a category that includes sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans -- would be counted as cars.
Another proposal, the official said, would set up a variety of fuel-economy standards for light trucks of different weights or sizes. The administration may also propose bringing trucks that weigh as much as 10,000 pounds fully loaded under the light-truck standards. Currently, the rules exempt vehicles of more than 8,500 pounds, like the Hummer H2, meaning they are not subject to fuel economy minimums.
The official, a member of the interagency group preparing the administration's proposals, said that regulators were focusing on light trucks partly because they lacked the authority, without explicit Congressional authorization, to change rules governing passenger-car mileage.
Some environmental advocates express concern that any rule that scrapped a fleetwide mileage requirement for light trucks could lead to an increase in gas consumption overall. "One could create a weight-based fuel economy system that either increased or decreased our gasoline consumption," said Daniel F. Becker, the global-warming expert at the Sierra Club. "The fear is the Bush administration, with former auto and oil executives at the helm, will want to create one that increases our gas guzzling to please their friends in Detroit and Houston."
The administration official said that the government's proposals were "aimed at achieving even greater fuel economy in model years 2008 and beyond while simultaneously protecting safety and American jobs."
For the last few months, an interagency group including representatives from the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency has been considering broad changes to federal fuel economy rules. The varying ideas are due to be presented in an initial proposal this spring covering the model years 2008 and beyond. It will be subject to a lengthy review process. 
Under current rules, the fuel economy of each automaker's fleet of cars must average 27.5 miles a gallon, while its light trucks need average just 20.7 miles a gallon. Growing sales of S.U.V.'s have reduced the fuel economy of American vehicles to their lowest point in two decades, according to the E.P.A.
For the 2005 to 2007 model years, the administration has proposed increasing light truck fuel economy by a half mile per gallon a year. 
The administration has said it wants to use its review to encourage production of more large cars, station wagons and some carlike S.U.V.'s known as crossover vehicles. The theory is that such vehicles are generally -- if not in every case -- safer than smaller cars, pickups and bigger, truck-based S.U.V.'s. So if more people drove them, officials figure, fewer people would die in crashes. 
The review process is followed not just by environmental groups but by automakers, labor unions and safety advocates. 
After Jeffrey W. Runge, the chief of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said last month that weight- or size-based standards were being considered as part of the review, the United Auto Workers sent a letter of objection to the Senate Commerce Committee. The union said it feared that tens of thousands of jobs could be lost because small-car production would suffer. 
But the administration official said today that such an idea would be considered only for light trucks, not cars, an idea that concerns environmental groups but could make regulations more favorable for General Motors and Ford Motor. 
The administration is also considering giving automakers' incentives, such as extra credits under the fuel economy rules, for producing cars with technologies like advanced diesel engines, or hydrogen fuel cells, which generate electricity from a chemical reaction.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Worldwide Market Rally Ends On Fear of a Longer War

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The worldwide rally in stock prices ended abruptly yesterday, with declines particularly sharp in Europe, as American-led forces in Iraq ran into fierce fighting in their drive to Baghdad.
 The major United States stock indexes fell at least 3.5 percent, but that performance was relatively good compared with that of many European markets. The leading Dutch index plunged 6.4 percent, and indexes in France, Germany and Switzerland fell 5 percent or more. 
 For the major markets, those declines simply offset much of last week's big gains, which came as the war began. The run-up may have reflected hopes that the war would be relatively brief, with large-scale surrenders by Iraqi troops, and that the prewar split in the Atlantic alliance would be papered over afterward. 
Instead, there have been indications of a more difficult time in Iraq and of continued ill feelings among countries that supported and opposed the United States and Britain in their decision to invade Iraq.
Though markets in most countries were mirror images of Friday, the Turkish stock market fell for the fourth consecutive day. The Istanbul Stock Exchange industrials index dropped 5.2 percent, bringing its losses for the four days to 16 percent. With the Turkish lira also falling rapidly yesterday, the index has fallen 32 percent in dollar terms, and is at its lowest level since the fall of 2001, when its economy was in a crisis.
One of the major uncertainties of the war is whether Turkey will intervene to keep Kurdish Iraqis from taking control of Kirkut in northern Iraq, and what the American and British troops might do if such a fight erupted.
In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 307.29 points, or 3.6 percent, to 8,214.68, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 31.56 points, or 3.5 percent, to 864.23. The Nasdaq composite fell 52.06 points, or 3.7 percent, to 1,369.78. 
The declines wiped out about a third of the gains that had been posted since March 11, a period during which the Dow and S.& P. indexes rose for eight consecutive sessions.
For the Dow, the session was the worst since last Sept. 27, when the index fell 3.7 percent. But while that decline came after a sustained fall in prices -- and happened only days before the market turned up -- yesterday's came after the best week for the index in more than 20 years.
The decline was as widespread as the recent rise had been. All 30 stocks in the Dow declined, as 29 had risen during the eight-day rally. Altria, formerly Philip Morris, fell $1.45, to $33.59. An Illinois judge on Friday ordered the company to pay $10.1 billion for deceiving customers by claiming "light" cigarettes were less harmful.
Interest rates on Treasury securities, which had risen last week, slipped back, with the 10-year Treasury note yield falling to 3.97 percent, from 4.10 percent on Friday.
The stock market declines began in Europe, after a day in which most Asian markets showed small declines and the Japanese market continued its recent rally, spurred in part by expectations that government-controlled pension funds might buy stocks to push up prices before the Japanese fiscal year ends next week. There was also speculation that the Bank of Japan might seek to put more cash into the economy. Today, however, Japanese stock prices opened lower, with the Nikkei 225 down 58.37 points, or 0.7 percent, to 8,376.70 at midday, after leaping 2.9 percent on Monday.
In the United States, the war news has at least temporarily diverted attention from economic issues, and last week there were hopes that a quick and easy victory would help restore consumer confidence. Yesterday, the talk was more of the damage that the war could immediately do to the economy, particularly to companies dependent on travel. Oil prices, which plunged last week, recovered some ground yesterday, further hurting airlines.
Delta Air Lines, which rose 27 percent on Friday, gave up most of that gain, falling $1.73, to $9.52. Northwest Airlines, which announced last Friday plans for layoffs, fell 94 cents to $7.36. Disney, whose theme parks could be hurt by a decline in travel, fell $1.34 to $17.40, despite the fact that "Chicago," a movie that was distributed by its Miramax unit, won the Best Picture award at the Oscars on Sunday night. 
Starwood Hotels, the owner of the Sheraton and Westin hotel chains, fell $2.69, to $24.11, after it warned that the war was cutting travel, and withdrew its earlier earnings guidance. In France, Club Mediterranee fell 1.70 euros to 19.14 euros, amid concerns that bookings at its resorts would decline.
Still, assuming that the war does end soon, some market observers questioned whether there was too much emphasis on the progress of troops advancing on Baghdad. "I don't know if you can price Procter & Gamble based on how we are doing in Iraq," said Thomas McManus, the equity strategist at Banc of America Securities in New York, who expects the American economy to rebound in the spring and thinks stocks are inexpensive. P.& G. fell $1.34, to $87.56.
James Paulson, the chief strategist for Wells Capital Management, voiced the widespread opinion that the outcome of the war was not in doubt, whether or not progress was as rapid as investors expected it would be last week. "Everyone is focusing on the war here," he said. "But in a few months, maybe people will be focusing on the fact there has been no terrorism attack, and that will improve consumer confidence."
But Douglas R. Cliggott, the chief strategist for B&P Research, a New York unit of a Swiss money management firm, said he thought the economy would be disappointing, and the war costs higher, than most expected. "We are really only in the first inning of our involvement in the Middle East," he said, pointing to estimates that large numbers of troops might be needed in a postwar Iraq. "There is a very significant possibility that we will have a tremendous number of young men and women there for a long time, and the financial impact of that has not been incorporated in financial asset prices."
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)


	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.709	99.419	High Rate	1.150	1.150	Investment Rate	1.174	1.175	Low Rate	1.13%	1.10%	Median Rate	1.14%	1.14%	Total applied for	$34,657,928	$37,928,856	Accepted	$21,846,491	$22,760,446	Noncompetitive	$1,445,386	$1,100,331	

Both issues are dated March 27. The three-month bills mature on June 26, and the six-month bills mature on Sept. 25.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; 
Dedicated to Straightening Out the Air Fare Tangle

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey 

 BODY:
ONE thing you ought to know about Terry Trippler, the well-known expert on airline fares who is based at the Web site www.cheapseats.com, is that he really, really hates to fly. He practically has to be forced into the air on the two or three trips he typically takes a year, and then only if he can wrangle a first-class seat.
 So it was interesting yesterday afternoon to touch base with Mr. Trippler by phone and find him in a cab bound for a TV appearance in Santa Monica, Calif., from Los Angeles, where he had just arrived on a flight from Minneapolis. 
 "We got to keep the economy going. We got to get on airplanes. We got to travel," he said. "I just flew out to L.A., and I wasn't afraid one bit. Nobody on the flight seemed nervous, either. Now, when I flew right after Sept. 11, people were nervous."
He flew to Los Angeles, he said, on "a low-fare carrier with a first-class section, which is what it takes to get me into an airplane."
Mr. Trippler, 56, who is also a familiar face as a consumer air-travel advocate on TV, clearly loves the airline business, even if he does not like boarding a plane. He works most days in an office converted from a two-bedroom apartment 20 floors below the family apartment in a downtown Minneapolis skyscraper, assisted by his wife, Lynn, his daughter, Kelly, and his son-in-law, Don.
A former airline ticket agent, tour director and travel agent, he developed an interest in the dark mysteries of airline fares just as they were becoming ever more complex in the early 1980's. Now, he commands a couple of computers in his office, with the goal of keeping track of the endless onslaught of fare and rules changes pumped out daily by major airlines to match the competition.
In an earlier interview, he suggested that he regarded his counterparts in the warrens of airline fare departments with a spy-versus-spy fascination.
"It would be interesting to know how many air fares are proactively put in and how many are just reactive," he said, clearly suggesting that the latter would be the case.
Three times a day, he said, the airlines are putting new fares into the system, which distributes them to the computerized booking systems used by travel agents. How many fares? "On average," he said, "there are about 200,000 changes a day."
The economic problems domestic airlines face -- with $18 billion in losses the last two years and another $10 billion or more expected this year -- are mostly attributable to high cost and low revenue.
But part of the lowering of revenue is a consequence of a wholesale shift in the buying behavior of business travelers. Three years ago, business travelers kept airlines prosperous by generally buying the top walk-up fares at rates five times, or more, higher than discount leisure fares. That gravy train slowed when the economy soured two years ago and almost screeched to a halt after the terrorist attacks.
And part of the reason for that shift in buying behavior was that Internet virtuosos like Mr. Trippler put out the word that a bit of shopping could yield huge discounts.
Still, he says, the basic marketing problem is that in their crazed rush to match one another's fares on competitive routes, while low-fare, low-cost competitors gobbled up customers, the airlines forgot that they were selling what should be a distinct product.
"We have six major airlines that have grown into this situation where they obviously have no faith in their product at all," Mr. Trippler said.
"They are so focused on the day-to-day revenue, micromanaging fares and matching each other's moves every minute that they can't look beyond that," he said. "They've got themselves in such a revenue bind now that they can't afford even a day or two days of being in what they consider a noncompetitive position." Nor, he said, are the major airlines willing even at this stage to consider abandoning their hopelessly complicated fare structures for a system -- similar to that of the low-fare carriers -- that would price business fares "rationally" once robust air travel resumes.
On a more practical level, since he is a consultant on cheap fares, he suggests that this is the time to book some. "Fares are lower now than in memory. It's a great time to be buying tickets," he said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Trippler will be back at his computer monitors tomorrow. "You keep at it, but they're fast, and they're good," he said of his nemeses in the airline fare rooms. "You realize that even after 35 years at it, you never really figure it out."

Fear of Illness in Hong Kong
Fears of a new respiratory illness, called SARS, deepened in Hong Kong as all public hospitals reduced nonessential services, workers and students were told to stay home if they felt sick and one of the two top officials handling the outbreak was hospitalized. A7

Federal health officials said that the respiratory illness that has sickened hundreds of people around the world might be caused by a different virus than first suspected. Leading virology laboratories that usually are competitive have been cooperating in response to W.H.O.'s declaration that the disease was "a worldwide health threat." A7

HEADLINE: PRO FOOTBALL; 
N.F.L. Europe to Play Despite War Concerns

BYLINE:  By THOMAS GEORGE 

DATELINE: PHOENIX, March 24 

 BODY:
N.F.L. Europe will proceed with its season despite concerns about a backlash from the war in Iraq, the National Football League owners decided today at their annual league meetings.
 The players will leave their training camps over the next couple of days for teams in Berlin, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Glasgow. They will open the season April 5-6. 
 There had been some concern by the owners that trouble could be lurking for American players in Europe because of war protests and the possibility of terrorist acts. But Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, said the owners were determined to move forward. 
"We are an American business in Europe, and like so many other American businesses there, we need to continue to operate," Tagliabue said. "The world has changed since the attack on the World Trade Center. Over the years we have done a better job of bringing up security standards there. There was considerable security effort post-9/11 and that will continue."
John Beake, the managing director of N.F.L. Europe, said: "One thing I've known from my travels there is that European countries take security very, very seriously. They have been dealing with this a lot longer than we have."
Each N.F.L. Europe team is made up of 48 players, 40 of whom are American. Five of the six coaches are American. 
The international players come from Mexico, Germany, Sweden, Croatia, Russia, France, Spain and Japan.
N.F.L. Europe is a developmental league for the N.F.L. and is the league's attempt at the globalization of American football. All 32 N.F.L. teams allocate players to the league. 
Two of the most successful players to make the leap from N.F.L. Europe to the N.F.L. are quarterback Kurt Warner, the St. Louis Rams' two-time league most valuable player, and Brad Johnson, last season's Super Bowl-winning quarterback from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
At least one N.F.L. owner, Al Davis of the Oakland Raiders, had suggested that the league wait a week before sending players to Europe.
But Wayne Weaver, the Jacksonville Jaguars' owner, said, "I think in the end everybody agreed that it would not make a difference if we waited a week or not because you can't predict the future; so, move forward with business as usual."
Carmen Policy, the Cleveland Browns' president, said: "We felt that after the league did a thorough job of investigating security and explored the ramifications of playing or not playing that there was a strong consensus to play. Even if there are disagreements there, Europe is an ally of the United States. All other American businesses in Europe have conducted business as usual and we will follow suit."
John York, the San Francisco 49ers' owner, said that the N.F.L. did not make a decision to move forward with the league "based on economics but clearly looked a safety first and felt comfortable."
And Pat Bowlen, the Denver Broncos' owner, said: "I'm very pleased that we made a decision that was not a very hard decision. I think in the end, we had 100 percent behind it. There is no reason for us to be a shrinking violet in this situation."
Also today, the owners approved a new television venture called The N.F.L. Network, which will broadcast league-related news, highlights and history on a daily, hourly, year-round basis on DirecTV. 
N.F.L. Films will be part of the venture, and the channel will offer, in addition to other programming, team news conferences and a video-on-demand system that will allow fans to see footage of games played.
It will not show live N.F.L. games.
"We wanted to have our own network and it will be on for 2003," said Bowlen, who is chairman of the league's broadcast committee.
"The real fan can get into it and have fun," Bowlen said. "It will have at least six hours a day of original programming."
The N.F.L. also announced a portion of the Week 1 schedule. The Buccaneers will meet the Eagles on "Monday Night Football" in Philadelphia; the Raiders will meet the Tennessee Titans on the first Sunday night game, and the Atlanta Falcons will play the Cowboys in Bill Parcells's debut as Dallas coach.
The meetings continue on Tuesday with a discussion on diversity and competition issues, including changing the overtime format to allow each team a possession in the extra period.
The eight-member competition committee has voted, 4 to 4, on that issue, so the owners will discuss overtime and may vote on it and other competition matters as early as Tuesday afternoon.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: POSTWAR PROJECT; 
U.S. Plans to Run Iraq Itself, and Is Assembling a Civilian Team

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24 

 BODY:
The United States is preparing to establish immediate sole control of post-war Iraq, initially without recourse to the United Nations, with a civilian administration under the direct command of the military, according to senior administration officials.
 Even before American troops reach Baghdad, administration officials are assembling a team of civilian officials, largely retired American diplomats, to run Iraq as soon as the fighting is over. 
 The administration has decided that helping the country and its people recover after the war will require a civilian corps in place working with the military as it tries to establish security throughout the country. 
European and Asian diplomats, while offering to help rebuild Iraq, raised questions last week about American plans to administer postwar Iraq without a central role for the United Nations. 
While the issue is debated at the United Nations and the European Union, the administration is going ahead with its plans for a civil peacekeeping operation under the direction of Jay Garner, the retired general who directs the Pentagon's new Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance. 
Mr. Garner arrived in Kuwait last week. He is overseeing the intense recruitment of his staff and preparing to administer Iraq under plans drawn up over the last two months.
"People who got called on Monday or Tuesday last week got deployedon Sunday," said a retired diplomat who has been asked to serve in Iraq. "They want me to get out of here by Sunday."
Senior officials are quick to say this arrangement is only temporary -- lasting, they hope, no more than a few months -- until an interim Iraqi government is in place. They also said they were still debating how to work with the United Nations when the time comes for that.
"The model could be an interim Iraqi government working with the U.N. -- we just don't know yet," said a senior administration official.
Bypassing the United Nations and setting up an American civilian peacekeeping administration under the military, however temporary, is a huge break from recent tradition and a denial of one of the United Nations' central roles since the end of the cold war.
But the United States may have no choice for the moment. Under international law, the United Nations may be unable to work under a military occupation force. While the United Nations can offer emergency relief for refugees, children, food distribution and humanitarian coordination, international officials say that the Geneva Convention would forbid long-term cooperation without approval from the Security Council.
"On the humanitarian side, we want to save lives no matter what," said Mark Malloch Brown, director of the United Nations Development Program. "When it comes to reconstruction, that's crossing a different Rubicon. We can't be authorized by a subcontract of the U.S. government. We have to be authorized by the Security Council."
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said on Thursday that he was consulting with the United Nations to try to resolve some of these questions and devise a way to "put in place broad Security Council authority to help the people of Iraq."
The goal, according to an administration official, is to avoid a "bloated, inefficient civilian U.N. peacekeeping force," yet still encourage United Nations participation in postwar Iraq under the American administration.
The United States has contributed $105 million to international organizations, including the United Nations, to operate humanitarian programs in postwar Iraq.
Richard H. Solomon, president of the U.S. Institute of Peace, has worked with the administration on the postwar Iraq plans and said that officials were caught between two goals.
"This Pentagon doesn't want the military to get bogged down in extensive peacekeeping operations, but at the same time they don't want to make the classic American goof of winning a war and losing the peace," he said.
Mr. Garner's team is organized along the lines of a slimmed-down United Nations peacekeeping operation, with Mr. Garner taking the role normally played by powerful United Nations administrators, like Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special representative in Afghanistan.
His team includes three regional coordinators and coordinators for reconstruction, civil administration and humanitarian assistance. They will oversee everything from emergency relief and refugees to long-term planning for roads, rail and waterways as well as economic development and weeding out senior officials of the ruling Baath Party of Saddam Hussein. 
A group of Iraqi expatriates will serve on an advisory council, according to the Pentagon. 
The administration has sought retired diplomats with a history in the area.
Barbara Bodine, who was ambassador to Yemen in 2000 when the destroyer Cole was attacked, will serve in central Iraq.
George Ward, the former ambassador to Namibia, will oversee humanitarian aid.
Others who have tentatively agreed to serve under Mr. Garner include Kenton Keith, the former ambassador to Qatar and director of the Coalition Information Center in Islamabad, Pakistan, during the Afghanistan war; Robin Raphel, the former ambassador to Morocco, and Timothy M. Carney, former ambassador to the Sudan. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 26, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about efforts by the United States to assemble a civilian team to run Iraq after the war misidentified the diplomatic mission formerly headed by Robin Raphel. She was United States ambassador to Tunisia, not Morocco.

Some Consolidation By AstraZeneca Unit

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
The United States operation of AstraZeneca in Wilmington, Del., which sells drugs like the stomach-acid treatment Nexium, said yesterday that it had consolidated most of its creative duties in the United States, which had been handled by nine agencies. Though billings were not disclosed, AstraZeneca spent nearly $199 million to advertise in major media last year, according to CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres. 
 Two companies whose agencies work for AstraZeneca, the Publicis Groupe in Paris and the WPP Group in London, were named to handle the majority of the creative duties. Agencies owned by two other companies that work for AstraZeneca, the Interpublic Group of Companies and the Grey Global Group, both in New York, will continue to handle assignments marketing to doctors; Grey is helping to introduce Crestor, a cholesterol-lowering drug, while Interpublic is handling the introduction of Iressa, a cancer drug. 
 AstraZeneca declined to identify the agencies being eliminated. The decision is part of an initiative started 18 months ago to increase coordination and integration of the company's marketing efforts.

HEADLINE: Contract for Oil Fires Set 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 24 

 BODY:
The Halliburton Company's engineering and construction unit won a contract today from the Army Corps of Engineers to extinguish Iraqi oil well fires and repair damaged wells.
 The unit's initial task will include responding to oil spills, said Cathy Gist, a spokeswoman for Halliburton's Kellogg Brown & Root subsidiary. 
Halliburton did not disclose how much the contract is worth. 
 Vice President Dick Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton until 2000, when he stepped down to join President Bush's election campaign.
In addition. Reuters reported that the United States Agency for International Development awarded Stevedoring Services of America a $4.8 million contract today to manage the Iraqi port of Umm Qasr, even before United States or British forces take control of the town.

How a Nightmare Began and Might Continue

BYLINE:  By NANCY RAMSEY; Nancy Ramsey is a freelance writer in New York specializing in the arts.

 BODY:
Their tones may differ, but in each of three documentaries about the roots of 9/11 and its aftermath in the Muslim world there is one truly terrifying moment.
 In "Al Qaeda 2.0," which will be shown tonight with "Terror's Children" on the new Discovery Times Channel and includes dramatic scenes of suspected Al Qaeda terrorists being hunted down in the caves of Afghanistan and the slums of Karachi, Pakistan, Dr. Saad al-Fagih, a leading Saudi dissident, says, "There is an impending attack coming, and this attack is immense, huge and either as big or even bigger than Sept. 11, and this attack is full of surprise." 
 In "Terror's Children" a boy of 10 who has bright eyes and a curiosity that is being stifled in a religious school in Pakistan visits a swimming pool where men and women frolic together. He surveys the scene, turns to an interviewer and says, "Everyone here is going to hell." 
In "Searching for the Roots of 9/11," which will be shown tomorrow night on the Discovery Channel and on April 1 on Discovery Times, Thomas L. Friedman, foreign affairs columnist for The New York Times, visits Al Azhar mosque in Cairo. Once the sermon ends, young men take over the mosque and "in aninstant we went from prayer to politics," Mr. Friedman says. While most of the worshipers had left the mosque, he adds, "it struck me that in some sense they were letting Islam and its spiritual message of a God of mercy and compassion be hijacked."
Each program is straightforward, an individual search by a journalist trying to understand some aspect of 9/11. Mr. Friedman's quest is twofold: "First, what motivated those 19 young men, those hijackers, to board those planes and kill 3,000 of my brothers and sisters? And second, why did so many of their fellow Arabs and Muslims applaud what they did?" His approach is measured and thoughtful as he travels to Belgium, Egypt, Bahrain, Indonesia, even to the studio of Al Jazeera television in Qatar. ("I, little Tommy Friedman, Jewish boy from Minneapolis, have been interviewed" on Al Jazeera, he says. "They get in my face, and I get back in theirs.")
Dyab Abou Jahjah, a young Muslim leader in Belgium, offers one root of 9/11: he says the United States has been supporting bullies in the Middle East for 50 years. Mr. Friedman's friend Rami Khouri, a Jordanian writer, tells him he thinks the United States has a "hypocritical policy and applies one standard here," another there. In Cairo, walking in the old neighborhood of Mohamed Atta, a leader of the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Friedman and Ali Salem, a playwright, talk about Mr. Salem's idea that in Egypt art, education and the economy had been leveled, making the hijackers feel like dwarfs. Consequently, they searched for tall buildings to bring down.
Throughout the program, produced by New York Times Television, Mr. Friedman returns to a softly lighted room and a comfortable chair, which paces the hour effectively, making it easy to absorb the ideas and information being presented.
No such calming effect is in order for Peter L. Bergen's quick-paced, action-packed "Al Qaeda 2.0." Mr. Bergen is the author of "Holy War, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden" (The Free Press, 2001). In March 1997, while working as a producer for CNN, Mr. Bergen, along with Peter Arnett, interviewed Mr. bin Laden, and "Al Qaeda 2.0" opens with Mr. bin Laden saying, "Targeting the Americans and the Jews by killing them in any corner of the earth is the greatest of obligations and the most excellent way of gaining nearness to Allah."
"Al Qaeda 2.0" asks, Where will Al Qaeda's next move be? If watching the hour is a bit dizzying, that is perhaps appropriate to the subject. A United States government counterterrorism coordinator says of Al Qaeda, "We're after them from the North Pole to the South Pole; there's no place to go, no place to run," but it is hardly reassuring when that statement is juxtaposed against the comment from a former C.I.A. operative that "they're everywhere and nowhere; we don't know where they are."
"Everywhere" is reinforced by the program's locations: Tora Bora, Karachi, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh.
If "Searching for the Roots of 9/11" is the intellectual quest and "Al Qaeda 2.0" the on-the-ground, cloak-and-dagger search, then "Terror's Children," also produced by New York Times Television, is the personal one, and the most moving. 
Sharmeen Obaid, a recent graduate of Smith College, returns to Karachi, where she grew up in relative affluence. Her purpose in "Terror's Children" is to meet and understand the Afghan children living in a refugee camp, children she sees wandering the streets of Karachi, "picking through trash and hustling odd jobs at the local markets," children most Pakistanis consider a nuisance, children who "are being brainwashed and trained as terrorists."
A first-time filmmaker, Ms. Obaid is compassionate but not sentimental. She speaks openly and matter-of-factly and, by letting the audience know her background, avoids the posturing of reporters who go to places with third-world conditions and assume an unctuous familiarity with their subjects.
Individual children come alive, if only for a brief time. It's hard not to wish the camera or editor had stayed in the company of some of them longer, but it was not always possible. Following people with a camera means calling attention to them; one boy who works as a garbage picker is hassled by private security forces more than usual. 
"Our first attempt at getting close to one of the refugees has only made his life more difficult," Ms. Obaid acknowledges. "Without notice he slips away."
She is professional, but she cannot help but grow close to some of the children. Abdur Raheem, a 13-year-old working as a carpet weaver, helps support his four brothers, including an older one who spends his time "pursuing personal pleasures" like using opium. Offended by his living off his younger brother, Ms. Obaid takes him to task a little. "As an outsider, and a woman," she says, "interfering any more with this Afghani man might be dangerous. But I hope life improves for this little family."
So, too, do we.

HEADLINE: Co-President At Goldman Announces His Retirement 

BYLINE:  By LANDON THOMAS Jr. and JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
John L. Thornton, the ambitious co-president of Goldman Sachs who had grown restless in his role as heir apparent, surprised Wall Street yesterday by announcing his retirement to become a professor in China.
 Mr. Thornton described his departure as voluntary, but he did not meet with strong resistance from Goldman's senior management, said some bankers close to the board. Mr. Thornton, a savvy banker with a wealth of client relationships, had less prominence within the firm than John Thain, his co-chief operating officer, the bankers said. Mr. Thornton and Mr. Thain had been designated as successors to Henry M. Paulson Jr., Goldman's chief executive, when Goldman sold its stock to the public in 1999 and they became co-presidents. 
 Mr. Thornton, 49, said during an interview yesterday in China, where he was traveling on business, that he intended to create a leadership training program at Qinghua University, one of China's most prestigious schools. He said he would hold a professorship at Qinghua and commute regularly from his home in New York. After his resignation, effective July 1, he will continue to serve as an adviser to Mr. Paulson and Goldman's clients on issues related to China. 
Mr. Thornton's decision to retire was prompted by a recognition that Mr. Paulson, who is 56, plans to remain Goldman's leader for at least three to five more years, delaying Mr. Thornton's expected promotion. He said he had always intended to leave banking relatively young and pursue a second career in public service.
"Hank has told us that he intends to be around for a long time," Mr. Thornton said. "I think that's terrific for Goldman. But for me, it was a question of the length of time I would remain a banker."
In public policy, Mr. Thornton would be following in the path of Jon S. Corzine, the United States senator from New Jersey, who in 1999 resigned as managing partner at Goldman Sachs after losing out in a power struggle. 
In many ways, Mr. Thornton was the prototypical Goldman Sachs banker. He joined the firm in 1980 and became a partner at the age of 34. An expert at mergers, he made his name by importing cut-throat deal-making tactics to the sleepy London markets in the 1980's. He soon became a silky, ubiquitous presence in corporate board rooms on both sides of the Atlantic.
With his floppy hair and horn-rimmed glasses, Mr. Thornton always had a bit more flash than the standard Goldman Sachs banker. He recently paid $18 million for a Georgian mansion on 118 acres in New Jersey's hunt country and maintains an antebellum rice plantation in Charleston, S.C.
Over the last four years, Mr. Thornton's compensation has totaled more than $40 million, and he holds Goldman stock worth $207 million.
He cultivated friendships and long-lasting business ties with corporate titans such as Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive of the News Corporation, and William Clay Ford Jr., a friend of his from their prep-school days who is chairman and chief executive of Ford Motor. Mr. Thornton served as a director at the News Corporation and Ford, which each did a considerable amount of investment banking business with Goldman Sachs.
Mr. Thornton harked back to Sidney Weinberg, the Goldman senior partner who managed the firm for 39 years. Mr. Weinberg sat on the board of countless companies, which generally did banking business with Goldman.
It was the way business was done in the 1940's and 1950's, with the starkest example being Ford Motor, a company that Goldman brought public in 1956. Mr. Weinberg had nurtured a friendship with Henry Ford II.
Mr. Thornton continued in that tradition, but in the wake of the past year's corporate scandals, this fusion of personal and corporate ties came to be seen as more of a liability than an asset by the public.
Mr. Ford was criticized earlier this year for acquiring a giant allotment of 400,000 shares of Goldman Sachs stock at the time of its initial public offering. The stock rose sharply, and his stake was at one point worth $52 million. Mr. Thornton's directorship and the lucrative banking ties that Goldman maintained with Ford came under sharp scrutiny, forcing Mr. Thornton to resign from the company's audit committee and Mr. Ford to eventually sell the shares. At the company's coming annual meeting, Evelyn Y. Davis, a shareholder advocate with a wide following within the shareholder activist community, said that she had been planning to ask publicly that Mr. Thornton resign his Ford directorship.
Mr. Thornton said that he had had a close working relationship with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Thain, but suggested that he had begun to outgrow his role as second in command.
"There is only so much you can do when you're not in the driver's seat," he said.
The co-presidency of Mr. Thain and Mr. Thornton was a legacy of Goldman's partnership days. Robert E. Rubin and Stephen Friedman had served jointly in the late 1980's under John C. Whitehead. The expectation was always that Mr. Thornton and Mr. Thain would have a similar relationship with Mr. Paulson.
At the age of 56, however, Mr. Paulson has shown no hint of stepping aside, meaning that the 49-year-old Mr. Thornton would have to serve as a potential successor for an undetermined amount of time.
Such a prospect was obviously not so appealing to Mr. Thornton, who has been described by those who know him well as a man of considerable ambition.
The recent appointment of Lloyd C. Blankfein, the head of Goldman's powerful fixed income, currency and commodities division, to the firm's board was also an early signal of evolving dynamics in Goldman's executive ranks. 
In one of the worst banking environments in a decade, Mr. Blankfein's proprietary trading business brought in more than $1.8 billion in net revenues during the first quarter, a 54 percent increase from a year earlier. Goldman Sachs' advisory business, where Mr. Thornton made his reputation, has suffered by comparison.
Mr. Thain, 47, who now becomes president and chief operating officer of the firm, is in many respects the flip side of Mr. Thornton. A low-profile numbers man, he spent the mid-1990's as Goldman's chief financial officer and head of technology and operations. Unusual in a firm that so celebrates its bankers, Mr. Thain's experience as an investment banker has been fairly limited, comprising a brief stretch in the bank's corporate finance department in the 1980's. Nor does he sit on any corporate boards. He and Mr. Blankfein now become the odds-on favorites to succeed Mr. Paulson.
China is an unusual move for a high-powered Wall Street executive. Though the fast-growing economy has recently become a major target of the leading investment banks, it is still a developing country with an insulated financial system.
Even in elite government and academic circles, only a smattering of people speak English, and Mr. Thornton does not speak Chinese.
But Mr. Thornton, who helped build Goldman's operations in Europe and Asia in the 1980's and 1990's, has prominent connections in China. He helped cultivate the firm's China's business. Goldman has become the leading underwriter for major Chinese state-owned companies spinning off parts of their businesses to international investors, including the multibillion-dollar offerings of China Telecom and Petro China.
Mr. Thornton said he had approached top officials of Qinghua, often compared to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States for its focus on the sciences, with the idea of creating a program on public policy for training government officials and business leaders. He said the program might grow to resemble the Yale School of Management, which Mr. Thornton attended. He said Qinghua's top leadership responded eagerly.
The concept, he said, grew out of a conversation he and Mr. Paulson had with Zhu Rongji, China's recently retired prime minister, during a visit to Beijing in 1999. Mr. Zhu, who was the founder and longtime dean of Qinghua's School of Economics and Management, asked Mr. Paulson and Mr. Thornton for help in expanding the school's international contacts and modernizing its curriculum.
The Goldman executives helped the school create an advisory panel with some top international executives. They also forged ties between Qinghua and Harvard Business School.
Even with Mr. Zhu's retirement, Qinghua remains a formidable center of power in Beijing. It is considered the cradle of China's technocrats, who now rule the nation. Hu Jintao, the new chief of the Communist Party, is a Qinghua graduate, as are two other members of the Politburo standing committee and two deputy prime ministers.
Mr. Thornton is an active Democrat and is thought to have political desires. He said he thought that managing relations between China and the United States was one of the major challenges in the new century.
"There's no question that the greatest marginal impact I could have is in China," he said. "I don't know where it leads exactly, but I know that wherever it leads, China will be part of my future."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: CAIRO; 
Arab Foreign Ministers Urge U.S. Withdrawal

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 24 

 BODY:
With images of bloodied Iraqi civilians and a defiant Saddam Hussein blanketing television screens across the Middle East, Arab foreign ministers here called today for an immediate American withdrawal from Iraq but agreed on little else to placate the growing numbers of protesters on their streets.
 The Arab League meeting, the first since the war began, put all the tensions and fears of the region on display, featuring short-tempered exchangesand barely disguised rudeness as Iraqi delegates and their supporters accused other members of disregarding the depth of antiwar sentiment among their own people. 
 "The Arab governments' stance should have been closer to their peoples' stance," said the Iraqi foreign minister, Naji Sabri, who had pushed for a tough resolution that would have denied coalition forces the use of Arab airspace, Arab land for bases and the Suez Canal.
As the ministers met in an ornate hall on one side of Tahrir Square, watched the war unfold on a television screen in a cafe on the other side of the square. 
Over the fragrant smoke of a water pipe, an accountant named Abdel Salam Abdel Moneim ventured the opinion that perhaps the Iraqi leader was not unrealistic in predicting victory, at least on Arab terms. 
"To Saddam, if 10 Iraqis die and one American dies, it's a victory," he said, keeping his eyes fixed on the television set. 
"He is a symbol of pride," Mr. Abdel Moneim added. "If Saddam succeeds, then no one will trespass against any Arab citizen again."
While admiration may be building for Mr. Hussein, many Egyptians say their feelings are more complicated, combining a deep sympathy for Iraqi people and a resigned sense of powerlessness. 
"I sympathize with everyone in the war, whether an American or an Iraqi," said another patron, Tarek Gamal, who said he was a sculptor. "Those who are dying are human beings." 
But he doubted that Arab nations could unite in a crisis that has amplified the differences in their economic and political interests. 
"In the past, values governed our behavior," Mr. Gamal said. "Now, money talks."
Arab leaders have been feeling intense pressure since the attack began. Mushrooming protests have been erupting into violent confrontations between demonstrators and the police, with mounting numbers of people arrested and reports of continuing unrest in Jordan, Yemen, Sudan, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.
Alarm at the political risks of a prolonged war, and the possibility of terrorist strikes on American and British targets in Arab countries, is palpable in every conversation with an Arab official. 
"You can't imagine how the military strikes on Baghdad and on the other cities are provoking people every night," said Mustafa al-Feqi, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Egyptian Parliament. 
"We don't think of Saddam," said Mr. Feqi, who described himself as a friend of the United States. "We think of civilian Iraqis who are dying every hour. And if the war continues and Saddam Hussein proves to be much stronger, the Arab street will blow up."
In the end, the Arab League foreign ministers concluded their half-day meeting by returning to the compromise phrasing adopted in resolutions at previous, and equally divisive, meetings about the Iraqi situation.
In addition to urging an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council, they said no Arab state should "participate" in military operations against Iraq, a formula that stops short of condemning the countries that are allowing American troops to operate from their territory.
Five member nations along the Persian Gulf are providing bases and other support for the American and British forces attacking Iraq. More radical states, principally Syria, demand the expulsion of all foreign troops from the region. 
Jordan, which had been importing Iraqi oil at bargain prices for years, shattered relations on Sunday by expelling three Iraqi diplomats for what it called internal security reasons, prompting Mr. Sabri, Iraq's foreign minister, to scornfully accuse Jordan of following American orders. 
One delegate to the meeting, Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim Jabr al-Thani of Qatar, simply walked out of the meeting an hour after the ministers started their discussions behind closed doors. Qatar is the site of the coalition's Central Command for the attack on Iraq.

HEADLINE: Democrats, Treading Carefully, Press On for Presidency 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY with RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: BRIDGEVIEW, Ill., March 24 

 BODY:
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman held three fund-raisers in Chicago today to finance his presidential campaign, and even squeezed in a town meeting here, where he denounced President Bush's economic policies.
 Representative Richard A. Gephardt headed for South Carolina this morning for a prayer breakfast alongside Representative James E. Clyburn, the most prominent member of the Congressional delegation in that pivotal early primary state. 
 And Senator John Edwards of North Carolina canceled a day of campaigning last Friday in New Hampshire and headed today for Fort Bragg, the Army base in his home state, to visit families of service members who have been deployed to the Middle East.
War goes on but, inevitably if not inexorably, so does the business of politicking -- from raising money to delivering political speeches to, well, to raising money. 
The candidates for president, as well as the Congressional campaign committees preparing for the 2004 House and Senate races, say they are weighing day by day what is appropriate to do or say at a time when the nation is absorbing endless images of soldiers in combat.
For most candidates, however, the political theater has not exactly gone dark.
The candidates' sometimes awkward struggle about how to campaign against a backdrop of war came as evidence emerged that their concern is well placed.
A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted over the weekend found that 50 percent of respondents said that the Democratic presidential candidates should suspend their campaigning during the war; 43 percent thought they should go on as usual. 
And in a finding that should be of particular note to the five Democratic presidential candidates who have raised objections to the war, 58 percent of respondents said the presidential candidates should refrain from speaking out against the war because it hurts the war effort, while 33 percent said it was appropriate. The telephone poll was conducted of 605 respondents, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.
Whatever the risks, after initially laying low, atleast some Democrats are venturing back into the daylight of the campaign trail.
Mr. Lieberman held a town meeting at Mama Luigi's Restaurant in this Chicago suburb today. He began his appearance by asking for a moment of silence and prayer "in hopes that this conflict will be over quickly" and that American soldiers would return unharmed.
"It would be kind of a victory for our enemies if we suppressed our political process in response to a war against them," Mr. Lieberman said in an interview between fund-raisers. "It would be giving them some strange victory they don't deserve. It's important to continue the work of democracy but do it with an understanding that this is a difficult time and we should each decide what is appropriate in this difficult time."
Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont who has presented himself as an antiwar candidate, was back in Iowa, a state with a large and vocal antiwar wing among Democrats. It was the start of what an aide said would be a week like any other week in Dr. Dean's campaign.
Mr. Gephardt's aides insisted that his trip to South Carolina was not a political event. Whatever he calls it, the Missouri Democrat found himself back in a pivotal early primary state -- and at the side of a South Carolina congressman whose support any Democratic presidential candidate would welcome. He is scheduled to appear on Jay Leno's television show later this week.
Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts was in New Hampshire this weekend, assailing Mr. Bush's record on domestic issues. But he toned down his criticism of what he has described as Mr. Bush's bungling of the diplomatic efforts leading up to the war.
Nowhere is the question of what is appropriate more pressing than on the subject of fund-raising, which has been proceeding at an energetic pace. Next Monday is the cutoff for donations that presidential candidates can include in their fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission for the first quarter of the year. The amount each raises is an early measure of candidates' political viability.
 An official at one Democratic campaign said most candidates would not dare risk curtailing their fund-raising with the end-of-the-month deadline looming. "Everyone continues to fund-raise," the official said. "March 31 is a big-deal deadline. The general sense in most campaigns is that they need to continue fund-raising and that because those events are private, the war doesn't invade the atmosphere as much as in a public event."
Mr. Gephardt has fund-raisers every day this week -- including one sponsored by the gaming industry on Thursday, followed by a hometown gala on Friday, where he is expected to raise $1.5 million. Dr. Dean is pressing the fund-raising circuit, heading to Rhode Island on Tuesday before returning to Iowa. Mr. Kerry is filling his own schedule with fund-raisers as the deadline approaches.
Republicans, too, are keeping apace. Last Tuesday, on the eve of the start of the war, the National Republican Congressional Committee was host to a salute to President Bush at the Washington Hilton, raising about $5.1 million. Both the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee plan to hold fund-raisers Tuesday night, with Democrats hoping to draw close to $2 million.
 Members of both parties said that while the image of politicians collecting campaign checks while America is at war might appear unseemly, it would be difficult for a member of either party to make an issue of it.
"People understand that fund-raising and politics is digging the foundation of a house," said Rich Galen, a Republican strategist. "It could be raining, but you still have got to dig that foundation. People have to be on the lookout for hypocrisy: this is one of those sauce for the goose, sauce for the gander things, in which everyone understands that fund-raising has to go on." 
Democratic strategists, moving pre-emptively to counter any attacks on their candidates' wartime fund-raising, have been circulating a memorandum detailing Republican fund-raising during past military conflicts, including Afghanistan, Kosovo, the Persian Gulf war and Grenada.
Not surprisingly, most of these events are closed to the press. When they are open -- Mr. Lieberman opened one this afternoon -- they are on the condition that television cameras be kept out. The last thing the campaigns want is news footage that might capture images of politicians pleading for money from big-ticket donors feasting at open bars and tables laden with food, an image that arguably might seem vulgar when Americans are fighting in Iraq.

HEADLINE: Budgetary Shock and Awe 

 BODY:
The American public transfixed by the unfolding invasion of Iraq may someday look up and discover too late what the Republican Congress did while the world's attention was elsewhere. Led by the Bush administration, the House and Senate are about to march under the public's radar screen and lead the country into a decade of budgetary disaster.
 The country is facing plenty of financial problems: the economy, the cost of the war on terrorism and the war in Iraq. Stunningly, Congress is preparing to make things far, far worse with more than $500 billion in tax cuts for the upper 1 percent of taxpayers. To finance these spoils for the wealthiest Americans, House leaders -- who have taken the lead in hammering a budget together -- plan deep cuts of $475 billion in vital programs for the bottom 99 percent. These direct hits will range from Medicaid to child care, education to food stamps, environmental protection to emergency doles for the poor. 
 This plan, in the form of a budget resolution tied to a firm tax-cut mandate, is moving forward on Capitol Hill even as lawmakers' boilerplate speeches resound with calls for shared wartime sacrifice by all Americans. How an average $90,000 tax cut for each millionaire counts as sacrifice is only one of many unexplained mysteries as Republican leaders fiercely protect President Bush's second wave of tax cuts. The gallant troops in Iraq who are being invoked daily in speeches by members of Congress might be interested to know that the array of cuts includes an estimated $14 billion reduction in military veterans' programs.
Last week, Senate moderates failed to pass what amounted to an embarrassment-reduction plan to halve President Bush's $726 billion tax cut. Now they talk of a last-ditch attempt to revive that half-loaf approach this week, before the tax cuts are written in parliamentary stone. But a few key liberals are so far refusing, furious at approving any new tax cuts that will increase the deficits of postwar America. We sadly urge reviving the half-loaf strategy, if only as a symbolic protest of the Republicans' shameful use of the fog of war in their budget scheming. As for shared sacrifice, tell it to the Marines.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: KREMLIN ROLE; 
Bush Calls Putin to Protest Sales of Russian Equipment

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON with SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 24 

 BODY:
The White House said today that Russian companies were supplying Iraq with sophisticated military equipment for use against the United States and that President Bush had pressed President Vladimir V. Putin during a phone call this morning to crack down on them immediately.
 Administration officials said the United States had been pressuring Russia for almost a year to end what American intelligence has identified as sales of three types of equipment to Iraq: night vision goggles, antitank guided missiles and devices that can jam satellite-based navigation systems used to guide weapons to their targets. 
 They said that in the phone call to Mr. Putin Mr. Bush focused on intelligence information that Russian companies are even now cooperating with Iraq in deploying the jamming equipment, which is intended to block signals from global positioning satellites to cruise missiles, "smart" bombs and other weaponry. 
"We are very concerned that there are reports of ongoing cooperation and support to Iraqi military forces being provided by a Russian company that produces G.P.S.-jamming equipment," said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. "We find these actions to be disturbing."
Mr. Fleischer said the United States had repeatedly made clear to the Russian government that it expects aggressive action to halt the cooperation by Russian companies with Iraq.
"President Putin assured President Bush that he would look into it, and President Bush said he looked forward to hearing the results," Mr. Fleischer said.
But Russian officials denied that Russian companies had been exporting military equipment to Iraq in violation of sanctions imposed on Iraq after the 1991 Persian Gulf war. 
"Russia strictly observes its international obligations," said Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, on Russian television. "It did not sell any equipment, including military equipment, in violation" of sanctions.
In a sign of the tension between Russia and the United States following Mr. Putin's decision not to back Mr. Bush in going to war with Iraq, the Kremlin offered its own version of today's phone call. "In an exchange of views on the Iraq crisis, the Russian side emphasized the humanitarian consequences of military action," the Kremlin said.
Administration officials said they had become increasingly frustrated at Russia's apparent unwillingness to crack down harder on the exports of military equipment to Iraq, which were first reported by The Washington Post on Sunday.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell followed Mr. Bush's call to Mr. Putin today with a call to Mr. Ivanov. Mr. Powell later told Fox News that "so far, I am disappointed at the response" from Russia.
Russia, like France and a number of other countries that opposed Mr. Bush's decision to go to war, has a long history of business ties to Iraq. There has been considerable speculation in the United States and Europe about which nations will have the best shot at profiting from any reconstruction, oil exploration and production and other business opportunities in Iraq after the war.
Despite the urgency of the appeals to the Russian leadership from the White House and the State Department, the Pentagon said that, so far, there is no evidence that the jamming equipment is affecting its ability to hit targets in Iraq.
Maj. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, vice director for operations on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, "What we've found is, through testing and through actual practice now, that they are not having a negative effect on the air campaign at this point."
In a telephone interview, Oleg Antonov, director and part owner of Aviaconversiya, which has been identified as the manufacturer or seller of the jamming equipment, denied having provided such equipment to Iraq. But he declined to give details on whether the company had sold the equipment to other countries in the Middle East.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: CHEMICALS; 
Industry Sees Opportunity To Push U.S. For New Rules

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
No one in the chemical industry will come out and say it. But the truth is, for chemical companies, the war in Iraq is not all bad.
 Executives know that in times of war, people harbor nagging fears that burning Iraqi oil fields and rampant unrest in neighboring countries could quench the flow of oil and send prices up sharply, inevitably pushing gas prices up as well. And that, they think, makes the timing right to push Washington for energy policies that will at least curb the volatility of gas and oil prices. 
 "The fact that we are having a war reminds us again of the fact that we have to come to grips with a U.S. energy policy," said Greg Lebedev, president of the American Chemistry Council, the industry's main trade association.
To be sure, the industry has a lot to worry about. Its major input, oil, is expensive, and its outputs go to many cyclical industries that will weaken as a war wears on.
Even so, few industry experts think that war will drive oil or gas prices significantly higher. The severe winter, coupled with the long run-up to war, did that months ago. "The rise in natural gas prices was extraordinary over the last three months," said Klaus Peter Lobbe, chairman of BASF. "Some of that was the severe winter, but without the threat of war, prices would never have been this volatile."
Now, the weather is warming up, and there is no longer uncertainty about war. For two weeks, oil and natural gas prices crept down, until yesterday, when oil prices surged 6.50 percent and natural gas 2.44 percent.
"A week ago, I'd have said that as soon as planes start flying, energy prices would go through the roof," said William S. Stavropoulos, chairman of the Dow Chemical Company. "But Saudi Arabia is producing full out, Venezuela is coming back slowly, and it doesn't look like there will be huge damage to Iraqi oil fields."
The chemical industry has a lot at stake in whether the oil keeps flowing. It uses oil and gas as raw materials as well as fuel.
Thus, the council did not wait for war to break out to use it as a platform for seeking help. On March 11, the council led a campaign to press the government to work with Canada and Mexico to increase the supply of natural gas in North America, to cut consumption by governmental agencies and to encourage conservation among consumers and companies. It also asked that the president not support either environmental regulations that discourage drilling in new areas or those that offer incentives to switch from coal to natural gas, thus causing a run on already tight supplies of natural gas.
Natural gas now sells for $5 to $6 per million British thermal units, a sharp drop from the $19 price of late February, but more than twice the $2.50 per million B.T.U.'s the industry had grown accustomed to. Similarly, oil prices have dropped more than $10, to less than $30, but that is still well above the $20 the industry considers acceptable. 
"After the last few months, $5 for natural gas may not look so bad, but it still is not cheap," said Frank J. Mitsch, a chemical industry analyst at Bear, Stearns, who said that when all the chemical companies have reported first-quarter results, "we will see a lot of red ink."
The immediate effect is not the same across the industry. The DuPont Company, which derives a large part of its revenue from pharmaceuticals or other products that are not based on hydrocarbons, has kept earnings up. Dow, which makes basic chemicals that are dependent on hydrocarbons, is in the red. 
DuPont spent about $2 billion on hydrocarbon fuels and raw materials last year. Dow, a similarly sized company, spent $8 billion. Dow's hydrocarbon costs rose $400 million in the last quarter alone. 
"No question," Mr. Stavropoulos said, "the impact of high energy prices has been dramatic for Dow."
But DuPont and companies like it are not home free. They may not buy a lot of hydrocarbons, but their suppliers do. DuPont uses butadiene methanol and cyclohexane ammonia, oil derivatives, to make nylon, while it uses ethane, made from natural gas, in its ethylene polymers.
"There's a four-to-six month lag between the rise of energy prices and its impact on our income statements," said Raymond G. Anderson, DuPont's director for investor relations.
Thus, if the war drags on, or if it spurs terrorist attacks, all bets are off.
"If the war drags on, energy prices really could rise again even as global economies drop," said Mr. Mitsch of Bear, Stearns. "And that could be a real double whammy for the chemical industry."

CORRECTION-DATE: March 27, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Tuesday about the chemical industry's response to the war with Iraq misstated the title of Klaus Peter Lobbe of BASF, who commented on the volatility of natural gas prices. He is chairman and chief executive of the company's North American operations, not of the company over all.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK; 
In Restaurants, the Wallet Before the Wine

BYLINE:  By Frank J. Prial 

 BODY:
"EVERYONE'S nervous," said Bernard Sun, "and people are afraid to spend." Mr. Sun was talking about wine sales at Montrachet, an expensive French-oriented restaurant in TriBeCa where he is the head sommelier. His customers are concentrating on wines in the $40 to $60 range this year, Mr. Sun said, adding: "Last year it was more $60 to $80. Two years ago, it was between $80 and $100."
 Montrachet is clearly not for bargain hunters, but it turns out that restraint, however modest, is evident everywhere in the restaurant world when it comes to buying wine. 
 Or so Wine & Spirits magazine has gleaned from its 14th annual poll of wine drinking trends in American restaurants. Mr. Sun was one of many wine stewards and restaurant owners queried for the report, which appears in the magazine's April issue. Sales of California cabernet "used to be status-driven," said Joseph Delissio, the wine director at the River Cafe in Brooklyn. "Now it's economically driven." Lee Ingold, at Peristyle in New Orleans, agreed. "High-priced California cabs are just kind of sitting around," he told the magazine.
Perhaps so, but the poll showed that the most popular cabernet among the 443 restaurants responding to Wine & Spirits was Jordan Vineyards Alexander Valley Estate, with an average price of $89. Second was Silver Oak Cellars with two wines, an Alexander Valley at an average price of $126 and a Napa Valley bottling that runs, on average, $149. 
The average price for an American cabernet in restaurants in 2002 was $69, down from $73 in 2001. Average price for a good, mostly cabernet Bordeaux last year was $114.29, up from $80.68 in 2001, according to the poll. Bordeaux accounted for only 7.7 percent of cabernet sales.
Yet in spite of those hefty Bordeaux tabs, French wines showed healthy gains in all major categories last year. In fact, the poll noted, they reached their highest share of the American restaurant market in 10 years: 16.7 percent. What many diners consider to be outlandish prices for domestic wines boosted French sales, many restaurateurs said. "The way things are now," Cyril Freshier of Rover's, in Seattle, told the magazine, a village Puligny-Montrachet "looks like a value against the high-end California chardonnays."
The Wine & Spirits poll was completed before the present diplomatic split between France and the United States developed. In recent weeks, a number of restaurants have reported guests who have rejected French wines. "We've had a few," Mr. Sun said. But, he added, "if they turn down a big white Burgundy, we're always happy to sell them a Kistler or some other Californian at an equally good price." 
Italian wines fared well in 2002, accounting for just less than 14 percent of the most popular wines sold in the responding restaurants. 
If irritation with the French continues, 2003 could be a banner year for Italian wines. Sommeliers traditionally saw wine by the glass as a way to introduce their customers to unusual wines. Now, they say, the attraction is saving money. "Our regular customers who used to order a bottle of wine will now go with just a glass of the same one," said Kris Kapoor of India's in Denver. Philippe Dubos of La Riviera in Metairie, La., said: "Instead of charging a lot for a great big 10-ounce glass of wine, we keep the price reasonable and pour 8 ounces instead." Sounds a little like those one-pound coffee cans sold with only 11 ounces in them. 
The most popular wines in restaurants are, as they have been in the past, mostly from California. At the very top are several that return year after year: Kendall-Jackson, Sonoma-Cutrer, Jordan, Robert Mondavi. But there is much more diversity. In 1993, Kendall-Jackson took first place with 37.5 mentions per 100 responses. This year, it was in first place once again but with only 17.5 mentions per 100 responses. Second on the list this year was Cakebread Cellars, from the Napa Valley. The rest of the top 10 were, in order, Sonoma-Cutrer, Jordan, Robert Mondavi, Sterling, Ferrari-Carano, Beringer, Clos de Bois and -- the only import -- Santa Margherita, from Italy. 
Americans are chauvinistic drinkers. Among the 50 top wines, only 11 were imported -- 5 from France, 4 from Italy and 2 from Australia. Only one Champagne appeared, Veuve Clicquot, and no sparkling wines. And this meager showing is double what it was just a year earlier. 
The domestic brands on the top 50 list were all Californians, except for King Estates, from Oregon, and Chateau Ste. Michelle, from Washington State.
A list of the lowest-priced wines, ranging from $18 to about $27, includes three white zinfandels that, to this fan, are wine only by a vigorous stretch of the imagination. More interesting by far is a list of the most popular wines at $25 and under. It includes a Kenwood Vineyards Old Vine Zinfandel at $22; a Columbia Crest merlot, from Washington; and an Estancia cabernet, both at $25.
Red wine continues to strengthen its position as the dominant restaurant wine. It accounts for just under 61 percent of all top-selling wines. Chardonnay continued its decline; in 10 years it has dropped from almost 40 percent of all top-selling wines in restaurants to just over 20 percent last year. Cabernet holds its own at about 17 percent, while merlot, which was wildly popular a few years ago, peaked at about 17 percent in 1997 and dropped to about 12 percent last year. As one sommelier told Wine & Spirits, "Syrah is the new merlot."

HEADLINE: New York Restaurants Now Cope With a War, Too 

BYLINE:  By ERIC ASIMOV 

 BODY:
WHEN the first cruise missiles were fired last Wednesday and the president announced that the war with Iraq had begun, most restaurateurs in New York expected that lean times would quickly get leaner. Already weathering the economic downturn, the dwindling tourism trade and the persistent worry of further terrorism, they believed even their loyal customers would stay home to watch the war coverage on television. 
 For some, the fears were realized. "The weekend was like, ooof, terrible," said Jean-Claude Iacovelli, who owns two small restaurants in SoHo, Jean Claude and SoHo Steak. "I don't know if it's all the war. We'll see next week." 
 Others to their surprise could not detect any difference. Tavern on the Green served dinner to 800 people Saturday night and brunch to 1,000 on Sunday. "It's about the same as last year," said Allan Kurtz, the general manager, although he allowed that the corporate-event business was off.
And some restaurateurs seemed unsure what to make of the war. "Things have been very inconsistent since the war started," said Julian Niccolini, an owner of the Four Seasons. 
One thing, though, seems plain: a war is not a good opportunity for fooling around. Last week, Tavern on the Green tried to have some topical fun (and gain some good publicity) by, as Mr. Kurtz put it, "de-Frenchizing" the menu, changing terms like filet mignon to grilled tenderloin and French fries to just plain fries. "We're not taking French wines off the list," Mr. Kurtz said Friday. "We're just making our own statement that we're an American restaurant. We're just poking a little bit of fun at the French."
By Monday, Mr. Kurtz had decided the idea wasn't so funny and shelved it. "People were taking it as being too anti-French and pro-war," he said. "We were making fun of it, and it's really too serious a situation to make fun of."
Eric Ripert, the chef and an owner of Le Bernardin in Midtown, found nothing funny when a party of 20 canceled a reservation last week. "The caller said, 'We cannot come, our client doesn't like the French,' " Mr. Ripert said. Boycotts against French products and restaurants may be easy, he feels, but accomplish little. 
"They don't understand that 90 percent of our employees are not French, and that we buy American products," he said.
Nonetheless, American passions seem to be running in the other direction. While no hard numbers are available, in restaurant after restaurant many people seem to be steering clear of French wine. "I've felt a huge difference in people refusing to order French wine," said Michael Mazzocco, the daytime manager of Fresh, a seafood restaurant in TriBeCa. At Tocqueville, a restaurant near Union Square named for the insightful French observer of the fledgling United States, it's no contest. "Everyone that opens the wine list, I would say 85 percent, say that they're not going to drink French, or that they shouldn't," said Jo-Ann Makovitzky, an owner. "I say I'll be happy to recommend an American wine to you."
French restaurateurs are so concerned that they have scheduled a meeting with Danny Meyer, the restaurateur who is also chairman of the restaurant committee of NYC & Company, the city's promotional arm. "It makes me sick, the whole thing," Mr. Meyer said. Mr. Meyer noted that business was down at four of his five restaurants, Union Square Cafe, Tabla, Gramercy Tavern and 11 Madison Park. The exception, Blue Smoke, is the least expensive and the only one with television sets, one tuned to basketball, the other to CNN.
Arnaud Carre, who owns the French Butcher in the East 20's, tries to defuse any hard feelings, although he says his customers have been supportive. "A few customers ask me where I stand," said Mr. Carre, who was born in Brittany. "I say, 'You're still coming to see me? You're not mad at the French today?' We clear the air."
Still, he says, business is down 25 percent since the war started. "It's more because people are scared and don't want to spend the money," he said. 
If people seem to be expressing their hostility to the French government it may be because it is so much easier than acting out against Iraq's. As near as can be told, New York has no Iraqi restaurants, nor are there any Iraqi products to boycott. "The only thing we used to sell from Iraq was date syrup, but we haven't been able to get any for the last five years or so," said Charlie Sahadi, who owns Sahadi's, a large Middle Eastern grocery on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn Heights. Since then, he says, he hasn't been offered any Iraqi products.
While French wine may be taking a beating, French cheeses are holding their own, at least at Murray's Cheese Shop in Greenwich Village. "People come in and joke about 'cheese-eating surrender monkeys,' but they end up buying French cheeses anyway," said Amy Sisti, the store manager. "Being that this is the Village, I think there is a little more acceptance and some lightheartedness, and even the possibility that the French have a good idea."
Artisanal, a brasserie in Murray Hill that specializes in French cheeses, is busy, said Terrance Brennan, the owner. "One customer said he didn't want any French cheeses but ended up picking three anyway," he said. But he said that another customer asked not to have a French waiter. "That was disturbing," Mr. Brennan said.
Conversely, New Yorkers have been quick to express their approval of Britain's support of the United States. At Tea and Sympathy, an English salon in Greenwich Village, Nicky Perry, an owner, says she's been hearing endless praise of Britain. "It's actually quite heartwarming," she said. "I'm glad to be helping the Americans and very proud of it." Nonetheless, she is disturbed by the anti-French activity. "I think it's appalling the way the French government has handled this situation, but what on earth has it to do with the poor blokes who own the restaurants?" she said.
No matter how much the war ends up hurting the restaurant business, most restaurateurs see it as just one more piece of what has been a very hard puzzle. 
"Bad economy, bad weather, the war compounds those things," said Stephen Hanson, whose company, B. R. Guest, owns 11 restaurants in Manhattan. "Any excuse the customer has to stay home, I think they're using it."

HEADLINE: Farm Exports Boom in Argentina 

BYLINE:  By TONY SMITH 

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
Horacio Castagnola permits himself a smile as, with a deft series of mouse clicks, he fills his computer monitor with satellite photographs of the multicolored patchwork of farms in Argentina's fertile corn belt. 
 By cross-checking land registers with the satellite images, taken every 16 days from 500 miles above the earth, Mr. Castagnola, Argentina's general director of taxes, can keep track of who is planting which crops, when they will be harvested, how much tax the farmer ought to be paying. 
 Hence the smile. 
Tax money is pouring into the coffers of the financially strapped country -- 5.5 billion pesos ($1.9 billion) in January, 64 percent more than a year earlier -- and Argentina's original economic engine, its farm sector, is responsible for much of the amount. 
While most of Argentina's economy is still groping for the smelling salts after a four-year recession, the farm sector is enjoying a boom in export sales, helped considerably by the plunge in the value of the Argentine peso last year.
After a decade pegged at parity with the dollar, the peso was cut loose last January, and is now worth about 34 American cents. Painful for most Argentines, the devaluation has wiped out most farmers' debts by making their products much cheaper overseas and effectively tripling the domestic value of their export sales. 
As a result, Argentina's trade surplus tripled last year to $15 billion, with about half of the country's total hard-currency earnings coming from agriculture, said Ernesto Ambrosetti, the chief economist at Sociedad Rural, a farmers' association. 
Though the Brazilian currency, the real, did not fall nearly as far -- just 35 percent against the dollar in the last year -- Brazil is also enjoying a farm export boom.
Farmers in the two countries have responded by stepping up production. Soybeans, Argentina's main cash crop, now occupy 64 million acres in Argentina alone. With record harvests in the offing, Argentina and Brazil together are on track this year to harvest more soybeans than the United States, the first time in memory that that has happened. 
American businesses are jumping in. Bunge, a major American food processor basedin White Plains, is idling its soybean plant in Cairo, Ill., and turning its attention to operations in Argentina and Brazil, while Bunge's giant rival, Archer Daniels Midland is expanding in Brazil.
Even the crisis in Iraq is helping rather than hindering South American farm exports. In the first two months of 2003, Brazil sold nearly $500 million of produce -- mainly chicken, beef and sugar -- to the Middle East, 60 percent more than in the comparable period in 2002, as countries in the region stockpiled supplies. 
The timing of the Argentine devaluation -- in January, in the middle of the Southern Hemisphere's growing season -- worked to farmers' advantage. 
"Farmers planted at one-to-one but harvested at nearly four-to-one, and most managed to liquidate their debts," said Alejandro G. Elsztain, chief executive of Cresud, an Argentine farmland management company, referring to the peso-to-dollar exchange rate. "It was a one-off," Mr. Elsztain said, "but it certainly helped put the sector back on its feet, and now it's generating an amazing cash flow.
"Before the devaluation, Argentine farming was efficient," he added, "now it's hyperefficient."
In the prosperity of the 1990's, Cresud saw the prices at which it bought or sold good-quality farm land rise from $2,000 a hectare (about two and a half acres) to about $5,000; prices collapsed in the political and economic turmoil surrounding the devaluation, the company said, but they are rising again and are now around $3,500 a hectare. 
And it is finding buyers. Of the 29 large farms it owned in 1997, Cresud has sold 11, using the profits to erase $20 million in debts and to buy a 24 percent stake in IRSA, a commercial real estate company with a market value of $150 million; Cresud has an option to buy another 12 percent.
The farming boom has brought badly needed business to other sectors as well. 
Toyota was quick to spot the potential, and registered itself as a grain dealer with the Buenos Aires Cereals Bourse so that it could take grain as payment for its HiLux pickup trucks. 
The rest of the Argentine auto market has all but collapsed, but HiLux sales are up 25 percent in the last year, said Mario Gilbert, a Toyota commercial director in Buenos Aires. Now, he said, the company is planning to trade in grain futures as a substitute for extending credit, and it has opened talks with llama farmers to barter wool for trucks. 
All this activity promises a measure of salvation for the country's battered treasury, which has promised the International Monetary Fund that it will come up with 74 billion pesos in tax revenue and post a surplus this year. "Agribusiness is, without doubt, the engine driving the government's tax effort," Mr. Elsztain said. "The I.M.F. should be very happy with us. Without agribusiness and oil, Argentina would never meet the surplus they are demanding." 
The government has imposed export duties of 20 percent on grain and 23 percent on soya and sunflower oil, provoking a one-week strike by grain traders in early March and the threat of another one after elections in April. But for now, the government looks a winner. 
Traditionally, economists here say, the farming sector neglected to declare about a third of its income to tax inspectors. But with Mr. Castagnola's satellite surveillance covering 80 percent of the farmland, more farms appear to be coming clean: declared values of harvested wheat are up 25 percent over the past year, and revenues from soya, corn and sunflower oil rose 18 percent, without a huge increase in plantings. 
Mr. Castagnola has spent $100 million since late 2000 buying the aerial photos from Landsat, the American satellite image company, but "for every peso we spend, we get a return of 138 pesos," he said. "From these satellite photos we can tell what sort of crop is being grown in each field, and even how ripe it is." 
Still, farmers like Mr. Ambrosetti say that the export levies the state has imposed could throttle investment. "It's the opposite of the United States and the European Union," he said. "We get no subsidies; we subsidize the government." 
But Javier Gonzalez Fraga, the former president of the central bank who now operates a dairy farm, said that the real problem facing Argentine agribusiness is not taxation but "the protectionism of the first world." 
In 1990, Mr. Gonzalez Fraga founded La Salamandra, which makes specialty dairy products like milk caramel and buffalo mozzarella cheese for export to Brazil, Chile, Spain and the United States. After his company won praise at the New york Fancy Food Show, its shipments to the United States have grown by 25 percent a year, he said, but the 68 percent import duties levied by the United States mean that a pot of milk caramel that costs $1 in Argentina sells for $8 in American specialty stores like Dean & Deluca and Williams-Sonoma. 
"Uncle Sam earns much more than me for every pot I sell," he said. "And it's the same for lemons from Tucuman and beef from Chaco." 
Mr. Gonzalez Fraga does not think either the United States or the European Union will expose their farmers to unbridled South American competition soon. But if the European Union refuses to cut its agricultural subsidies or the United States continues to keep agribusiness off the agenda of free trade talks for the hemisphere, "Argentina and Brazil will never be able to pay off their massive debts," he said.
"That's elementary," Mr. Gonzalez Fraga said. "If they don't buy, they're condemning us to eternal recession and the debt spiral."

HEADLINE: Philippines Boycotts UBS in Anger Over Bond Criticism 

BYLINE:  By WAYNE ARNOLD 

 BODY:
While investment banks in the United States are being chastised for sugar-coating their research reports to please companies whose securities they underwrote, the Philippine government is taking steps to punish one investment bank for sounding a sour note on an investment there -- Philippine government bonds.
 Since January, when UBS Warburg issued a report highlighting questions about the Philippine government's economic statistics, the government has banned it from raising or managing government funds and from various trading activities in the country, according to a number of news reports. 
 "It's funny," said an investment banker in Singapore who follows the Philippines. "They want the big brokerage houses to have independent research, and then they do this." 
What apparently angered the Philippine government was the timing of the critical Warburg report. It was issued just as the government was trying to sell overseas investors $500 million in bonds to finance its budget deficit. The bond issue sold well anyway, but officials later complained that Warburg's report forced them to offer a higher interest rate than they would have otherwise.
"I can see why they're upset," Jojo Gonzales, managing director of the Manila brokerage house Philippine Equity Partners, said of the government.
The direct impact on UBS Warburg, a unit of the Swiss bank UBS, is unlikely to be significant -- perhaps a few million dollars in commissions and fees for a company that earned more than $2.2 billion last year. Even so, it comes when investment bankers in Asia are fighting to win a dwindling number of deals with increasingly slim commissions. A spokesman for Warburg in Tokyo said the firm would have no comment on its relationship with the Philippines.
Bankers say the government's unusually bitter reprisal -- it has also publicly attacked an International Monetary Fund official connected with the Warburg report -- could backfire, eroding investor confidence even further. Efforts to reach the Philippine finance secretary, Jose I. Camacho, were unsuccessful.
Mr. Camacho and his colleagues in the government of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo are under pressure from many directions, from a rebellion in the south to soft export markets and high unemployment, and now the threat that turmoil in the Middle East could push up oil prices and disrupt the flow of money sent home by Filipinos working there. 
The country's seeming inability to stamp out corruption and tax evasion has made investors skeptical of its fiscal discipline, and the Philippine peso is trading near record lows against the dollar.
The current dispute arose from a review by the International Monetary Fund last year of a statistical anomaly in the Philippines' balance-of-payments figures -- an unexplained apparent outflow of money. The fund learned that the true problem was that the country's duty-free zones were underreporting imports.
"They really didn't care" about keeping complete records of imports that would not be taxed, Steven Hess at Moody's Investors Service in New York said of the officials compiling the figures. "There was no incentive for them."
The problem was alluded to in a monetary report in November but did not make headlines in the Asian financial press until January. Reports that the current-account surplus was smaller than the central bank had reported -- a fact apparently well-known to Philippine bond analysts -- prompted the bank to announce that it would revise downward its figures going back to 2000. 
Warburg's analysts issued their report the same day, alarming some foreign investors who were considering bidding for the new Philippine government bonds. The bonds ultimately sold at a yield of 9.509 percent, up from 9.125 percent two months earlier and a quarter-point more than the government had planned on.

HEADLINE: A Cuban Dissident Is Defiant After Crackdown Nets Dozens 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MIAMI, March 24 

 BODY:
Although dozens of his colleagues are imprisoned and his house is under police surveillance, Oswaldo Paya vowed today that his civic movement to bring reforms to Cuba would not be crushed.
 Mr. Paya, the organizer of the Varela Project, a petition drive signed by more than 11,000 people seeking a referendum on personal, political and economic rights, is among a handful of dissidents who remain free after a crackdown last week by the Cuban authorities. 
 He said about 80 people -- independent librarians, journalists and many of his group's regional leaders -- were in jail on charges that could bring lengthy prison sentences after an islandwide sweep that began last Tuesday. 
"They are trying to close the door on peaceful change," he said in a telephone interview from Havana.
The arrests came after several years of relative freedom in which dissidents assumed a higher profile as they met with a succession of foreign dignitaries, including former President Jimmy Carter, who publicly endorsed the Varela Project in Havana last May. Mr. Paya went on an international tour that included meetings with Pope John Paul II and the American secretary of state, Colin L. Powell.
Mr. Paya, who has won numerous international human rights awards, insisted that the recent arrests would not deter him.
"In no way will the project be stopped," he said. "There had been a flowering in Cuba of a peaceful movement for rights and reconciliation, to defeat this culture of fear. Cuba's spring is the Varela Project, which has been sustained by thousands and which will grow."
Governments and international rights groups have condemned the arrests and demanded that the Cuban authorities immediately release the prisoners.
The Cuban government has described the dissidents as subversives conspiring with James Cason, the chief American diplomat in Havana. Mr. Cason has met often with the island's dissidents and has spoken out publicly against the government of President Fidel Castro.
Asked if the arrests were meant to derail the Varela Project, a spokesman for the Cuban diplomatic delegation in Washington said he did not know.
"You have to get to the essence of the problem," said the spokesman, Juan Hernandez Acen. "These groups are a minority in Cuba and represent nobody. They were not arrested for what they thought, but for acting against and threatening national security."
Mr. Paya said that he and his colleagues had been prudent in their dealings with Mr. Cason and that they did not accept money from the American government. He speculated that perhaps the Cuban authorities were trying to gain some leverage with the American government, which has imprisoned five Cubans on espionage charges.
Cuban officials have compared their roundup of dissidents to the United States' mass arrests after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Mr. Paya said such accusations were part of the government's relentless defamation campaign against him.
"That mocks people's intelligence," he said. "We are claiming our rights."
But the threat felt by the Cuban government is real, diplomats and political analysts said, because the project relies on Cuba's own system to bring about change. 
Mr. Paya and his supporters took advantage of a provision in the Cuban Constitution that says citizens can call for a referendum if 10,000 signatures are collected.
Yet despite the boxes of petitions that were delivered last May, and Mr. Carter's nationally televised speech in which he challenged the government to publish the project's proposals, officials have been mostly silent. 
"They do not dare mention the project," Mr. Paya said. "To mention it will have people asking: 'What is it? We want to learn about it.' And all who know it know it is something positive."

HEADLINE: Low Interest Rates Help Keep Home Sales Brisk in February 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
Americans, undeterred by impending war and encouraged by record low mortgage rates, bought existing homes in February at a brisk pace, the National Association of Realtors reported today.
 Homes sold at an annual pace of 5.84 million units, down from a record 6.1 million in January, the association said. 
Higher sales levels occurred only in January 2002, when the pace was 5.96 million and in December 2002, at 5.91 million. 
 The low mortgage rates are expected to buoy sales of houses this year as well, economists said. Because home sales are counted when the transactions are completed, the totals reflect purchases arranged in previous months, before heavy February snowstorms discouraged shopping, consumer confidence reached decade lows and unemployment edged higher.
"Generally strong sales are expected this year, assuming the war in Iraq is not prolonged," said David Lereah, chief economist for the Realtors' association. At the same time, he said, "the fragile economy combined with geopolitical concerns clouds the outlook," and last month's storms will probably reduce March sales.
Economists had forecast that sales of existing homes would decline to a 5.8 million annual pace.
The supply of existing homes available for sale, another gauge of housing demand, fell to 4.4 months' worth in February, from 4.5 months in January.
The median price of an existing home rose 0.9 percent in February, to $161,600, from $160,200 the previous month. The price was up 8.2 percent from a year earlier.
In the Midwest, sales rose 4.8 percent, to an annual pace of 1.3 million. In the South, sales decreased 8 percent, to a pace of 2.3 million. Resales in the Northeast dropped 2.9 percent, to 680,000, and in the West they declined 6 percent, to a 1.56 million annual pace.

HEADLINE: 5 Vacancies Hamper Job Of Deciding Fair Rents 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Every spring, the city's Rent Guidelines Board deliberates over how much rents should rise or fall for the one million or so apartments in New York City that are subject to rent regulations. And yesterday, the board was scheduled to meet for the first time this year to debate what many housing groups say could be the biggest rent increase in years because of higher costs for property taxes, fuel and insurance.
 But there was no meeting yesterday, and for good reason. The board does not have enough people. 
 The board has only four of nine positions filled. The five other members either resigned, indicated a reluctance to serve again or were not reappointed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, according to board members.
Several board members said that having five vacancies was troubling because of the short time before the May 5 meeting, at which the board is to take a preliminary vote on rent changes. They also cited the volume of work involved -- particularly in a struggling economy -- and the byzantine nature of the regulations.
"It's not just the issues of the guidelines, but also the institutional memory of the guidelines," said Agustin Rivera, a former board member who said that he did not want to be reappointed this year. "People coming in fresh are really not savvy enough to know what questions are asked, what perspective to have."
But according to Marvin Markus, the board's chairman, the lack of a quorum is not a major concern. Five candidates have been selected, and the Department of Investigation is conducting background checks on them, Mr. Markus said. And if things go well, those appointments could be unveiled within the next week or two, he said.
Still, several former board members said that the job is thankless and stressful and that the learning curve for any new member is steep.
The board has nine members, all of whom are selected by the mayor: a chairman; two tenant advocates; two landlord representatives; and four members of the public who are supposed to be the middle ground. Everyone is supposed to have experience in housing, finance or economics. No one is allowed to own rent-regulated apartment buildings.
In addition to Mr. Rivera, the public members who are no longer on the board are David Rubenstein, who is now deputy budget director of the city's Office of Management and Budget; Bartholomew D. Carmody, an accountant, who asked to step down last year; and Mort Starrobin, a businessman in the packaging business.
Vincent S. Castellano, a real estate broker who was one of the landlord representatives, was also not reappointed -- much to his surprise. "You would think that in such circumstances, before you burn your bridges, you would know where your new bridges are," Mr. Castellano said.
While the next scheduled meeting for the board is on April 15, the most crucial date on the calendar is April 25, which is when the board's Price Index of Operating Costs, or PIOC, comes out. That index is one of several research studies that the board uses in deciding how much to increase the rents.
Last year, the board raised rents by 2 percent for a one-year lease and 4 percent for a two-year lease. This year, though, landlords have been suggesting that rents be increased by double digits. And though the five candidates have already been given background information to prepare them for the numbers and the rules, nothing may prepare them for the onslaught of life-and-death emotions that are a staple of the board's public meetings.
"I'm glad I'm not on the board," said Edward S. Hochman, a former board chairman. "When the double-digit price index comes out, I don't want to have to buy a bulletproof vest."

HEADLINE: Ban on Smoking in the Workplace Draws Little Protest at a Senate Committee Vote in Albany 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 25 

 BODY:
The Senate Health Committee had only one issue to debate today -- a proposal for a statewide ban on smoking in the workplace -- but so many lobbyists, political aides and journalists jammed into its conference room here in the State Capitol that the door could not be shut.
 As supporters and opponents spilled out of the room, the 16-member committee unanimously passed the smoking bill after only muted criticism from several senators. 
 Lawmakers were cautious, knowing that things have a way of veering off course in Albany, but they said the Legislature could pass the measure as early as Wednesday.
The bill, which re-emerged just days before New York City's tough new antismoking laws are to go into effect, would ban smoking in nearly every restaurant, bar and indoor workplace across the state. The bill, which has broad, bipartisan support, was approved today by the health committees in both chambers. 
But 5 of the 10 Republicans in the Senate committee officially signaled their reservations about the bill by voting in favor, but "without recommendation."
"I agree that smoking is very bad," said Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Republican from Binghamton. "But the ramifications of this bill, as strict as it is, will be devastating on small businesses. I think there could have been much more compromise."
Under the state ban, smoking would be restricted to a handful of indoor work sites like cigar bars, private hotel rooms and membership clubs with no paid workers. It would also tighten or eliminate several exemptions in the city ban. For instance, the state ban would limit special tobacco-promotion events at restaurants and bars to two nights a year, instead of the five allowed under the city ban. 
While Senate and Assembly leaders have agreed on the smoking ban, a number of their members have quietly opposed it. They say that such a measure would hurt small businesses that are already reeling from the recession, and undermine the costly efforts undertaken by some of them to comply with local antismoking laws. 
They also questioned whether localities would have the resources to enforce the smoking ban. Senator Libous proposed that counties be allowed to opt out of the ban, a suggestion that was quickly dismissed by Senate leaders.
Lobbyists on both sides of the issue have also stepped up their efforts in the past few days, unwilling to declare victory yet -- or concede defeat. Last year, a different antismoking bill that would have banned smoking in restaurants made it this far, but in the face of a heavy lobbying campaign by the restaurant, tobacco and liquor industries, Senate Republicans never put it to a vote.
"There is no doubt that we are working hard right now," said Scott Wexler, executive director of the Empire State Restaurant & Tavern Association, whose 5,000 members are contacting all 212 legislators to oppose the bill. "I think the train is definitely moving, but it hasn't arrived yet at the station."
This year, however, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, is aggressively pushing the antismoking bill even though members of his Republican conference have opposed it. He said today that he expected it to come up for a vote when the Senate convenes on Wednesday.
Senator Bruno, who needs 32 votes to pass the bill, said that he had not yet taken a count of his Republican members but added that he was "comfortable that there will be enough votes." 
Even if Senator Bruno does not have enough support from his Republicans, the bill could still pass with enough votes from the Democratic minority. 
Meanwhile, the Democratic-led Assembly also moved closer to passing the smoking ban. The Assembly Health Committee voted 20 to 3 in favor of the bill this afternoon, and sent it to the full chamber for a vote on Wednesday. 
The Assembly has passed antismoking bills in the last two years, and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, is listed prominently on this year's bill as a sponsor.
Opponents of the smoking ban, though, were busily pressing their case with legislators, particularly the Democratic minority in the Senate. After Assemblyman Daniel J. Burling, a Republican from a rural area southwest of Rochester, voted against the bill in committee, one tobacco lobbyist rushed up to shake his hand.
"I think individual counties should be setting the rules," Assemblyman Burling said afterward. "I'm not pro-smoke, but I am about individual rights and freedoms."
That message was also echoed by the Conservative Party of New York State, which is influential with upstate Republican senators. Even before the bill was introduced last Friday, Michael R. Long, the party chairman, had already faxed out a news release saying that American troops in Iraq would be shocked "to find that their freedom of smoking a legal substance has been usurped by our democratically elected officials."
But even some opponents acknowledged today that antismoking legislation was becoming increasingly difficult to derail in Albany and elsewhere. In the past year alone, New York City and at least five counties -- Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Orange and Dutchess -- have passed similar laws. 
The state ban, if approved, would apply to localities that either do not have any existing legislation or have less-restrictive legislation. It would not affect localities that have stronger laws, like Westchester and Nassau, or limit their ability to pass stronger laws in the future.

PERSON: Adam Osborne 

HEADLINE: Adam Osborne, 64, Dies; Was Pioneer of Portable PC 

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
Adam Osborne, a British technical writer who became one of Silicon Valley's legends by introducing the first portable personal computer in 1981, died on March 18 in Kodiakanal, India. He was 64 and had a series of strokes in the last decade, said his former wife Cynthia Geddes.
 The Osborne 1 computer, which was introduced at the West Coast Computer Faire in June 1981, was a 24-pound luggable machine that came with a large library of essential software, including a word processor, spreadsheet, database and programming languages. At the time, it was a startling innovation in an industry that was dominated by a do-it-yourself hobbyist culture. 
 Dr. Osborne distinguished the Osborne Computer by noting that it was "adequate," a break with the superlative-filled industry promotion of the era.
"I liken myself to Henry Ford and the auto industry," he said in a 1982 interview. "I give you 90 percent of what most people need."
The machine created a sensation in the rapidly growing PC marketplace, even though it came with a cramped five-inch display screen. The common belief at the time was that customers were paying for the software, which included popular programs like WordStar, the SuperCalc spreadsheet and Bill Gates's version of the Basic programming language and were getting the computer free.
The Osborne Computer Corporation in Hayward, Calif., became synonymous with the Silicon Valley tradition of hypergrowth defined by companies like Apple Computer and Atari. Orders for the Osborne 1 totaled 8,000 in 1981 and jumped to 110,000 in 1982. At one point, the company said that it had a 25-month backlog of orders.
In 1982, Dr. Osborne, who was an enthusiastic pitchman with a stylish British accent, prematurely announced the second-generation Osborne, called the Executive.
When the company encountered manufacturing difficulties, it found itself drowning in inventory as customers deferred purchases of the original machine in expectation of the new one.
The computer maker became an iconic symbol of Silicon Valley's boom-and-bust economy on Sept. 13, 1983, when it declared bankruptcy and a local newspaper photographer captured Dr. Osborne covering his face with his briefcase as he headed for his car in the company parking lot.
Although the industry focused on the company's management and logistical problems, at the time Osborne was feeling increasing competition from I.B.M. as well as other makers of portable computers including Kaypro, Corona and Compaq. Several industry experts have said the company's collapse had as much to do with its failure to jump quickly to a 16-bit microprocessor and I.B.M. compatibility.
Dr. Osborne was born in Thailand in 1939 to British parents. He grew up in southern India, where his father, the writer Arthur Osborne, a devotee of Sri Ramana Maharshi, helped popularize ideas from Eastern religion in the West. Dr. Osborne moved to England as a teenager and received a degree in chemical engineering from Birmingham University.
He later received a doctorate in chemical engineering at the University of Delaware and took a job with Shell Oil in California. In the mid-1970's he became a computer hobbyist and began self-publishing on computing.
In 1979, he sold his small publishing company to McGraw-Hill and used the money along with venture capital to found Osborne Computer in 1980.
After Osborne Computer collapsed, he founded Paperback Software International, with the idea of selling inexpensive software bound into books. The company was an initial success, but it ultimately lost a legal battle with Lotus Development in 1987 over a spreadsheet program that infringed the operating commands of Lotus 1-2-3.
He returned to India in 1992 when his health began to fail to live with his sister, Katya.
In addition to his sister and Ms. Geddes, his first wife, he is survived by three children, Alexandra and Paul, both of Oakland, Calif., and Marc of Washington. He was divorced from his second wife, Barbara Zelnick.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: REGIONAL MARKET/Orange County; 
Market Is Growing for Industrial Space

BYLINE:  By SANA SIWOLOP 

DATELINE: GOSHEN, N.Y., March 21 

 BODY:
Demand for industrial real estate space in Orange County, N.Y., better known for its rolling hills than for its warehouses and factories, is growing quickly and moving in several new directions, local officials and real estate executives say.
 While Orange County has only 17 million square feet of industrial space, compared with more than 700 million square feet in a multicounty area in northern and central New Jersey, a major industrial center, demand in the county has jumped considerably over the last two years for both build-to-suit industrial space and buildings built on speculation. 
 While the speculative market fell dormant in Orange County in the late 1990's -- and only 65,000 square feet were built last year -- officials say they are seeing new interest.
But for now, the build-to-suit industrial market is the predominant one. Elisabeth Mansfield, the founder of Mansfield Commercial Real Estate in Goshen, estimates that the annual amount of built-to-suit space in Orange County grew to almost 1.1 million square feet last year, from 500,000 square feet in 2001 and 30,000 square feet in 2000. Last year, she said, the largest such project in the county was a 526,000-square-foot distribution center in Chester for Amscan, a party supply company based in Elmsford, N.Y. 
Officials in Orange County are banking on Wal-Mart Stores to close soon on a 320-acre site in Wallkill where the company announced last summer that it intended to build a 1.2-million-square-foot distribution center. They also remain optimistic that the Target Corporation will reconsider its decision last fall not to pursue approvals to build a 1.2-million-square-foot distribution center in the town of Montgomery. 
Maureen Halahan, president and chief executive of Orange County Partnership, a nonprofit economic development group, said she was also encouraged by the growing number of small manufacturers moving to the county. "We were surprised by the interest," she said, "because so much U. S. manufacturing is moving offshore, but these are solid companies." 
Michael Torelli, a senior business attraction specialist at the partnership, said manufacturing companies rented or bought 100,000 square feet of industrial space in Orange County in both 2001 and 2002, compared with 7,000 square feet in 2000. Mr. Torelli said that 18 companies had visited Orange County recently to look at industrial space, and 9 were manufacturers. Similarly, he said, of the 17 Orange County companies looking to expand, 8 are in manufacturing.
Ms. Halahan said her group estimated that 1.9 million square feet of industrial space was available in the county but that there was demand for 7 million square feet, excluding Wal-Mart's planned project.
Speculative developers have been active lately in the town of Wallkill, particularly near the intersection of Interstate 84 and Route 17, which is being converted to a federal highway, Interstate 86, said John F. Ward, the town supervisor.
Wallkill has approved plans by AVR Realty, a developer in Yonkers, for two industrial buildings on East Main Street; the buildings would add up to 600,000 square feet. The town is also seeing renewed interest from Frassetto Commercial Investments of Upper Saddle River, N.J., an industrial park developer that has built speculatively in the county.
Chris Frassetto, a partner at Frassetto, said his company had been encouraged by Wal-Mart's interest in the area and by a number of companies in Connecticut and New Jersey that have been trying to move to Orange County. Two years ago, he said, his company built a 72,000-square-foot building on speculation at 225 Tower Drive in Wallkill; that building is now filled by Durasol Systems, a company that makes retractable fabric awnings.
In November, Frassetto broke ground on a 160,000-square-foot building near 225 Tower, at 45 Turner Drive. Mr. Frassetto said his company intended to ask Wallkill to approve plans for another 300,000 square feet of speculative space.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
Low Consumer Confidence May Be Bullish

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in almost 10 years this month, the Conference Board reported yesterday. And that may make it a great time to buy stocks.
 Only during four previous periods in the history of the survey, which dates to 1967, has the index plunged as low as the reading of 62.5 yesterday. In each case, the move came when the stock market had been weak but was poised to rise the next year. 
 What is different this time is the behavior of consumers. In previous eras when consumer confidence plunged as low as it is now, the effects of a loss of confidence were quite visible in the housing market. Now, the opposite is true.
"Americans are so depressed now that they go out and buy a home," said Ed Yardeni, the chief investment strategist of Prudential Securities.
The strength of the housing market has been the most impressive part of the current economic performance. That is reflected in attitudes. A survey by E*Trade released yesterday found that 62 percent of its customers believe that homes are better investments than stocks.
Another difference with past periods of low consumer confidence is that in the prior times, the economy was in recession when the consumer confidence number fell so far.
Now there is -- at least in the opinion of most economists -- no recession. The recession that began in March 2001 has not yet been declared officially over by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which decides such things. But it probably ended in late 2001, and since then the economy has shown uneven growth, but has not experienced any negative quarters.
Still, the record of the stock market after confidence has fallen this far is worth noting.
The first time it happened was in October 1974, at the end of the worst bear market since the Great Depression. The previous year, the Dow was down 30.4 percent and housing starts were less than half the level they had been two years earlier. The next year, the Dow leaped 25.6 percent.
Consumer confidence bounced around at low levels for a few months and did not rise above 62.5 until April 1975.
The second period when confidence fell that low began in April 1980, during a recession that was brought on by credit controls aimed at restraining inflation. The Dow was then down just 4.4 percent over the previous year, but housing starts were off 42 percent from two years before. In the next year, the Dow rose 22.1 percent. Consumer confidence numbers stayed at or below today's level until July.
The third time began in February 1982, when the Dow had fallen 15.4 percent over the previous year and housing starts were more than a third below their level of the two prior years. Consumer confidence stayed low for a year, not climbing over 62.5 until the next February. 
The great bull market of the 1980's and 1990's began in August 1982 and by February 1983, the Dow was up 35 percent from where it had been a year earlier.
The final period of low consumer confidence began in November 1990, when housing starts were down 27 percent over the previous two years, and the country was worried about Iraq, which had invaded Kuwait the previous summer. 
In that case, American victory in the gulf war the following winter did not immediately do much to restore confidence. While the consumer confidence numbers bounced around, they did not rise above 62.5 for good until November 1993.
Nonetheless, the first year after the numbers fell that low, the Dow rose 13.1 percent, after falling 5.4 percent in the previous year.
Three of the four previous times that consumer confidence fell to the current low level came when oil prices had soared, as they had done this year until the rapid fall last week. That decline came as the current war against Iraq began and the stock market had its best week since 1982. Only in 1982 were rising oil prices not a significant concern when consumer confidence fell to levels as low as now.
There is, of course, no guarantee that consumer confidence will quickly rebound. For while it is very low, it still is well above the record low for the index, of 43.2 in December 1974. Signs of weakness in housing could cause consumers to grow still more fearful. But the fact remains that each time consumers were as worried as they are now has proved to be a good time to buy stocks.
As it happens, superhigh consumer confidence numbers have also been a danger sign. The first time the index climbed above 141 was in October 1968, when speculation in small stocks had reached a peak, and most stocks were not good investments. The index returned to that level in December 1999, as the final run of the bull market was taking place. By the time it fell below that level for good, in September 2000, the market's rout was under way.

Each time, the move came after the stock market had fallen, and share prices rose over the next year. But in this case, unlike all the previous ones, consumer confidence fell while the housing market remained strong.

HEADLINE: Lending Law In New York Gets Different Interpretations 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Two top credit rating agencies are scheduled to announce today conflicting interpretations of New York State's new predatory lending law. 
 Moody's Investors Service will say that because of unclear definitions of what turns a high-cost loan into an illegal predatory loan, it will not be able, for now, to give a credit rating to pools of mortgages sold to investors in the secondary market that include certain high-cost mortgage loans originated in New York State. 
 Moody's interpretation could contribute to the curtailment of high-cost mortgages in the state. Without a credit rating, mortgage pools would be close to impossible to sell to investors and lenders would not be able to obtain money for new loans easily. A credit rating reflects the likelihood investors will get their money back. 
But Fitch Ratings will say that it can rate pools including high-cost mortgage loans from New York. But to receive a credit rating, the mortgage pool would have to include special enhancements that would effectively cover any losses to the pool and its investors from the penalities assessed if some loans were found to be predatory, said Carol Faber, a senior director at Fitch.
The split between the two credit agencies, with a third ruling expected from Standard & Poor's later this week, leaves unclear what the effect of the new state law, which goes into effect next Tuesday, will be on the high-cost, or subprime, mortgage markets. High-cost mortgages have interest rates as much as nine percentage points over comparable Treasury rates and fees of more than 5 percent.
It is possible that some lenders will find the cost on enhancements under the Fitch interpretation too costly and decide not to become involved in high-cost loans.
The new state law comes after New York banking regulations against predatory lending that went into effect in 2000.
Some mortgage lenders have said that these regulations have already reduced the number of high-cost loans. But the state banking department has said that the regulations reduced predatory loans but kept high-cost loans available.
The decisions from Moody's, Fitch and Standard & Poor's have been awaited with much anticipation. The penalities allowed under a predatory lending law passed in Georgia last fall were considered such a threat to the value of the trusts holding the pools of mortgages that the three credit rating agencies said earlier this year that they could not give credit ratings to any mortgage pools including Georgia loans.
Those decisions effectively closed the Georgia mortgage market and led to the rewriting of the law this year. Now, there could be a debate about changing the New York law if the issuing of high-cost mortgage loans were to dry up.
High-cost loans, which are made to homeowners with lower incomes and troubled credit histories, have been the subject of abuse. Some lenders get homeowners to refinance mortgages without providing any financial benefit to the homeowners and saddle them with high monthly payments that result in the loss of the property.
The new law provide penalties for the originators of such loans and for the concerns that combine mortgage loans into pools and sell them in the secondary market.
The problem for Moody's, according to Jay Siegel and Christine Lachnicht of the structured finance group, is that the New York law fails to define clearly when a high-cost mortgage refinancing loan is predatory and, therefore, increases the risk of predatory loans being included in a pool of mortgages.
Because it is not possible to determine how many refinancing loans might be predatory, it is not possible to determine the amount of penalties the mortgage pool and its investors might face. 
In addition, the two said they had not yet seen a mortgage pool created in a way that would provide enough coverage, or enhancements, for possible losses to make a credit rating possible.
Moody's did say that mortgage pools with no more than 2 percent of high-cost loans that are mortgages for the purchase of a house could "pass muster" because the definition problem applies to refinancing mortgages. But to pass muster, these pools would have to include clauses that would require the originators of the mortgages to cover penalties if any mortgage were found to be predatory.
But a large part of the high-cost loan business is based on refinancing mortgages because the borrower has the equity in a house to pledge. In addition, one mortgage banker said yesterday that the New York banking regulations had already driven them out of the high-cost mortgage business.

HEADLINE: Ex-Executive Pleads Guilty to Fraud on Sales Figures 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
A former vice president of Symbol Technologies, a manufacturer of data scanners and bar code readers, pleaded guilty yesterday to federal securities fraud charges, admitting to a scheme to inflate Symbol's reported sales by millions of dollars.
 Robert Asti, who was a vice president at Symbol from 1999 through March 2001, acknowledged in federal court in Central Islip, N.Y., that he persuaded Symbol's customers to buy scanners and readers that they did not need by promising them that Symbol would buy the devices back later. 
 In some cases, Symbol paid what amounted to bribes to its customers so that they would participate in the scheme, according to Mr. Asti's plea. The company called those agreements "candy deals," according to court documents. 
Mr. Asti's plea is part of a continuing investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors into Symbol's accounting, prosecutors and the agency said yesterday.
Last week, Symbol, which is based in Holtsville, N.Y., said that it and several former employees had received Wells notices from the commission, informing them that the S.E.C. planned to file civil suits accusing them of violating securities laws.
"We're looking wherever the facts lead us," said George Stepaniuk, assistant director of the Northeast regional office of the S.E.C.
The plea by Mr. Asti adds to a growing list of recent cases in which federal prosecutors have worked with the S.E.C. to file criminal securities fraud charges. The S.E.C.'s investigation into Symbol began early last year, and the relative speed of the investigation reflects the Justice Department's new aggressiveness on corporate crime, said Eric Corngold, chief of business and securities fraud for the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York, which brought the charges.
"The president's corporate fraud task force wants actions brought faster," Mr. Corngold said.
Symbol has acknowledged inflating its sales and profits and said it would restate its results from 1999 through 2002. The company is conducting an internal inquiry and has said that it could lower its reported sales for both 1999 and 2000 by as much as 10 percent, or a total of more than $250 million. Symbol had planned to file restated financial reports by Monday, but last week it delayed that deadline until June.
Last year, Symbol had profit of $11 million, or 5 cents a share, on sales of $1.3 billion, but it warned when it reported those results in February that those figures were unaudited and subject to change. Symbol's shares, which rose as high as $45 at the peak of the technology bubble in March 2000, closed yesterday at $9.48, up 3 cents.
In a separate but related action, the S.E.C. filed a civil case against Mr. Asti in federal court in Brooklyn, accusing him of committing and aiding securities fraud. Unlike the criminal case, the S.E.C.'s action has not been resolved.
In criminal court yesterday, Mr. Asti pleaded guilty to one count of securities fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud. The charges carry a maximum prison sentence of up to 15 years, Mr. Corngold said. Mr. Asti could face a shorter sentence if he cooperates with prosecutors, Mr. Corngold said. He was released on a $500,000 personal recognizance bond.
Mr. Asti and Paul Shechtman, his lawyer, did not return calls for comment. A spokeswoman for Symbol said the company had changed its accounting and sales practices as a result of its internal investigation.
According to court documents, Mr. Asti and Symbol encouraged the wholesalers who distributed the company's devices to buy scanners that they did not need, a practice called "channel stuffing."
In general, channel stuffing is legal, but not smart business because the wholesalers eventually need to cut back on their orders to sell the products they have already bought. However, channel stuffing can be illegal if the company making the products explicitly promises its wholesalers that it will repurchase them if the wholesalers cannot sell them. That is what Mr. Asti and Symbol did, according to the documents. Symbol did not return calls for comment.
In the "candy deals," Symbol sold its devices to distributors, who then passed them to the companies "value-added resellers," or V.A.R.'s, at a higher price. Symbol then repurchased the devices from the resellers, adding a 1 percent bonus.
"Asti and other high-ranking executives at Symbol knew that the transactions generated no net income for Symbol," according to the court documents.
"On the contrary, Asti and others at Symbol knew that the candy deals in fact resulted in a net loss to Symbol because the price a V.A.R. paid to the distributor for the products was higher than the price the distributor had paid Symbol for the products, which meant that Symbol had to repurchase the products at a price greater than the price at which it had sold the products."

HEADLINE: Communist Revolt Is Alive, and Active, in the Philippines 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: SAN AGUSTIN, the Philippines 

 BODY:
A seeming anachronism that was almost eliminated in the mid-1990's, the world's longest-running Communist insurgency is coming back to life. It took the Rev. Paul Sahagun by surprise the other day. 
 He was leading a group of women in choir practice when, without a word of warning, armed soldiers were clambering all over his little whitewashed church -- up the stairs, onto the roof, across the terrace. 
 "I just told the women: 'Let's keep on practicing. Just ignore them,' " he said the other day. "All of a sudden we heard shooting, loud shooting." Everybody screamed and ran."
Just beyond the little dirt-floored pool hall beside the church, five Communist rebels were hiding in the shanty of a farmer named Felipe Mallari.
For more than two hours, the priest said, there were bursts of gunfire followed by periods of dead silence. Then the soldiers were carrying out the bodies, four men and a woman.
"People say the girl was just taking a bath, the amazon, and she went inside to change her clothes," said Zenaida Sigua, who owns a tiny grocery opposite the house, using the popular term for the women among the guerrillas. "That's why the amazon, she's the only one fighting. The others, they were taking a snack outside the door, under the guava tree." 
So common have such encounters become around the country that this shootout in the rice fields north of Manila drew just four paragraphs in a national newspaper. In the past three years, the Philippines has seen a steep rise in attacks, ambushes and assassinations by the insurgents, as well as raids by the military. 
A nationwide movement that feeds on the country's widespread poverty and government abuses, the Communist rebels -- the New People's Army -- pose a greater potential long-term challenge, according to analysts, than does the Muslim insurgency in the south that today preoccupies the military, as well as the United States.
Active in a number of areas around the country, the insurgents generally operate in small units, although they sometimes carry out attacks with as many as 100 or 200 fighters.
Here in the shadow of Mount Arayat, a rebel stronghold, villagers say the Communists are more active than ever. "Do I feel safe?" said Father Sahagun. "Who feels safe in a place like this? Nobody feels safe."
Adding to the danger, the Communists have threatened to form a "tactical alliance" with the Muslim insurgents, who are fighting a separatist war on the southern island of Mindanao and on smaller neighboring islands. Some of the Muslims are believed to have links with terrorist groups associated with Al Qaeda.
The United States has placed one small, violent band, Abu Sayyaf, on its list of terrorist organizations and earlier this year offered to send some 2,000 troops to help fight it. It is the much larger group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, with which the Communists have been in contact.
Last August, at the request of the Philippine government, Washington also added the Communist insurgency and its front organization, the National Democratic Front, to the list.
A party leader, insisting that only his underground name, Ka Oris, be printed, denied that the Communists' carefully selected targets constitute terrorism. But the designation seems to have fired the insurgency into showier attacks and more belligerent statements, including threats against American military personnel here on training exercises. 
"Any deployment of United States troops within or along the periphery of the territory of the revolutionary movement may be regarded as acts of provocation," said Gregorio Rosal, a Communist spokesman. 
A freeze on money transfers to terrorist groups also appears to have led to an increase in the extortion of "revolutionary taxes" from plantations, fisheries, logging operations, bus companies, cattle ranches, construction projects and cellular telephone companies, as well as to reprisal raids against those that refuse to comply.
Along with ambushes of military patrols and raids on armories, newspaper reports show, the guerrillas are busy burning farm equipment, logging trucks, bulldozers, generators, buses and cellular telephone relay stations.
The Communist insurgency, founded in the mountains near here 34 years ago, reached its peak in the mid-1980's as the main outlet for opposition against the martial-law rule of President Ferdinand E. Marcos, who was driven from office in 1986.
Undermined by amnesties and weakened by military offensives, surrenders and internal purges, the insurgency withered in the following years. But the poverty and corruption that gave rise to the movement continues to animate it today.
A local reporter who has watched the insurgency come back to life here in central Luzon said that time was on the side of the rebels. "I believe it's easier to recruit these days because people are so poor and there is so much graft and corruption in government," he said. 
After the Marcos years, many of the group's leading figures returned to the Philippine mainstream as social workers, professors, even in some cases as prominent members of government.
But the movement's founder, Jose Maria Sison, who had fled to the Netherlands, remained an inflexible Marxist. The party slowly reconstituted itself behind his hard line and began to rebuild its fighting force.
"As long as you have a society that is 40 to 50 percent poor, 40 to 50 percent hungry and 40 to 50 percent oppressed, the grammar of insurgency will be there," wrote Teodoro Benigno, a columnist and former government official, after Washington labeled the movement terrorists.
"You can't expect peace," he wrote. Recruits for the insurgency "are going to be around," he added, "because of poverty and oppression, because of an economy that is a failure and a democracy that does not work."
The revolutionaries might seem quaint if they were not so dangerous, their statements cluttered with the cliches of an earlier century. Ka Oris, the underground leader, said that despite the decline of Communism around the world, it remained the wave of the future.
"It is not a matter of how many revolutionary movements are following the Marxist path," he said. "It is a matter of which path is correct. As for the revolutionary movement in the Philippines, we adhere to Marxism, Leninism and Maoism because it is the right way for a semifeudal and semicolonial country to launch a revolution for its national salvation."
It appears now that a new generation of Philippine rebels is learning to view the world through this ideological prism.
"The future is bright," Ka Oris said. "I would not give a time frame, but I would only say that in the next two or three decades we will see the victory of the revolution."

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: ANKARA; 
No Promises From Turkey About Staying Out of Iraq

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, March 25 

 BODY:
American officials today implored Turkish leaders here to keep their troops out of northern Iraq, but the talks ended without any assurance from Turkey that its troops would stay away.
 The issue has been a point of keen contention between Turkey and the United States, longtime allies whose ties have been severely strained by the American-led war in Iraq. American officials worry that the arrival of Turkish troops could set off violent clashes with Iraqi Kurds. 
 For the second day in a row, Zalmay Khalilzad, the special American envoy to the Iraqi opposition, met with Turkish officials here to try to settle the issue. Mr. Khalilzad did not report any progress.
"We will continue our discussions," he said. "This is a difficult and complicated issue."
As he and other American officials continued to exert pressure on Turkey, President Bush announced a supplemental war budget that included a $1 billion aid package for Turkey. That amount was much less than the $6 billion or more that American officials initially offered in return for a degree of military cooperation that Turkey did not ultimately provide.
But it suggested a desire by American officials not to end up at greater odds with a friendly country that shares a border with Iraq and that could threaten the stability of northern Iraq by sending troops there.
Asked about the motive behind the aid package, Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, told reporters in Washington that the United States recognized the strides Turkey had made in stabilizing its economy.
Mr. Fleischer also acknowledged the potential economic consequences of the war on Turkey. Turkish officials say that after the Persian Gulf war in 1991, Turkey lost tens of billions of dollars in diminished tourism and trade. That war also sent refugees streaming into Turkey, and Turkish officials now say they would order troops into northern Iraq, where Turkey has maintained a small military presence for years, to prevent that from happening again.
Turkish officials also express concern about Kurdish terrorists crossing with refugees into Turkey. Political analysts say Turkey has yet another, perhaps greater worry.
"They fear that there will be a Kurdish semi-independent state which might pose a danger in the future," said Can Paker of the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation, referring to what analysts believe could happen in northern Iraq after the war.
Over the last week, there have been conflicting reports about whether Turkish troops entered Iraq after the war began, and there has been growing international opposition to any military incursions by Turkey.
On Sunday, Mr. Bush warned Turkey away. On Monday, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain did the same. In addition, European Union officials have suggested publicly that Turkey would jeopardize its long-frustrated bid to join the union if it sent troops into northern Iraq.

 "Scared, I probably would be at home in a closet," Ms. Hillery, 50, explained as she awaited the start of a town hall meeting on domestic security here at the Michigan State Fairgrounds. "This is concerned. Just want to know enough to be knowledgeable." 
 Like the more than 500 other people who turned out for the unusual session on Monday night, including dozens of neighborhood-watch captains and radio patrollers, Ms. Hillery left clutching a color-coded sheet outlining what to do if the nation's threat level switched from its current "high" level to, say, "severe." And that, plus 90 minutes of reassurance about Detroit's readiness from a dais full of politicians and safety experts -- as well as a fashion show parading the latest in high-tech gas masks and hazardous-materials suits -- made her feel a whole lot better.
"I learned the basics," Ms. Hillery said. "Enough to feel confident. Enough to feel like I'm on the right track."
Detroit was among the first cities to hire a director of homeland security and file its action plan with the federal government, and Monday's town hall, broadcast live on local radio and shown on cable television, was headlined, "If the nation goes to red, Detroit is prepared." The session, called by Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick to soothe fears over domestic defense during wartime, at times took on the tone of a church meeting and at others felt like a political rally.
Among the speakers were Michigan's two United States senators, Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, both Democrats, who criticized the Bush administration as not giving cities enough money to protect themselves, and said they would push for new money in the supplemental budget allocation being voted on this week in Washington.
Mayor Kilpatrick told the crowd: "The best kind of homeland security and safety element that we can have in this city is community.
"The city is safer now than it was a year ago, and it'll be safer than that six months from now. In a post-9/11 world, we have to be prepared for any and everything. This time, I believe we are."
Jerry Oliver, the city's chief of police, and his state police counterpart, Col. Tadarial Sturdivant, were careful to emphasize that there had never been a specific terrorist threat detected against Detroit, or Michigan. But with a bridge and tunnel to Canada, a long open lakefront, the largest concentration of Arab-Americans in the United States, the regional supply of fresh water and a nuclear reactor just down the road, there is plenty to worry about here.
If terrorists were to strike locally, asked a man named Harvey in one of dozens of questions submitted by the audience, "what plans are in place to keep the local economy moving?"
A woman named Rosie wondered, "How do we help seniors that are homebound, alone and afraid to answer the door and the phone?" 
Other questions quickly followed: "Are the hospitals prepared to deal with an act of bioterrorism?"
"How secure is our river?"
"What can we all do as individuals to help out?"
Senator Levin summed up domestic security as three C's: common sense, confidence and community. Colonel Sturdivant used three P's: planning, preparedness, proactive. But it was the mayor's mother, Representative Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, who had the crowd saying "amen" and "uh-huh."
"Don't get all tied up in CNN -- sometimes it's good to turn that off," said Ms. Kilpatrick, a Democrat. "I don't want to make you scared. I want to make you informed."
Before entering the auditorium, people had to pass through a gantlet of police officers in uniform, as well as a metal detector. A sign of the times was posted on the door, listing prohibited items: posters, flatware, handcuffs, drugs, aerosols, ammunition or "weapons-like objects (bats, clubs, batons, etc, including toys and replicas)."
The Police Department's new Mobile Field Force, in military-style pants and gas masks, paraded on stage, followed by a firefighter in a hazardous-materials suit, who looked like a giant wrapped in tinfoil. Officials urged residents to draft family disaster plans and emergency kits, but they said duct tape and plastic sheeting were less important than blankets and batteries. 
"I wrote down everything they said," said Patricia Taunton, 51, who said her attendance at the session was a rare respite from round-the-clock CNN monitoring since the war began. "I only need a couple of items."
"According to what they're saying, they're prepared," Ms. Taunton added. "They're talking good. We'll have to see it in action."

Women On Tour Out of Tune

BYLINE:  By SELENA ROBERTS 

DATELINE: KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. 

 BODY:
IT is always request hour for a superstar; so, when the stadium D.J. was told Jennifer Capriati had a special song in mind for her prematch warm-up on Monday, the first response was, "For you, Jenny, the moon."
 Then Bob Ruf previewed cut No. 11 on the blank CD Capriati provided. "About 59 seconds into it, you hear a chorus singing, 'Bombs over Baghdad, uh-huh, uh-huh,' " Ruf, head of production at the Nasdaq-100, said yesterday. "I said: 'No way. I can't play this.' The decision was made not to run the song." 
 And yet, a back-and-forth between the Capriati camp and the tournament leaders unfolded, one official said, ending in capitulation to the star. Under their floppy straw hats and S.P.F. 45, fans that were more Muzak than MTV were greetedwith the first 57 seconds of the Outkast rap song entitled "Bombs over Baghdad," cut short of the chorus.
"I liked the song," Capriati said through Tour officials yesterday. "And I wanted to support the troops." 
Politics aside, her logic was questionable. How uplifting is a song illuminated by such abrasive lyrics? But Capriati made a wish, and it was granted. Star power has its privileges on the women's tour, but it is often misspent on petty demands instead of tennis reform.
This selective celebrity threatens an already troubled WTA. When it suits the players -- when they want a store closed for their shopping pleasure, when there are Grammy tickets to be had or a Hollywood party to crash -- few mind asserting their influence.
But with Tour sponsors evaporating in a soft economy and a lame-duck leadership in crisis, with a laborious schedule of agent-run events devouring their bodies and a 2002 year-end championship noted as an unattended bust, the players cannot even manage a divalike, "Don't you know who I am?" 
"You know what, there are a whole bunch of tournaments out there, but there is only one Serena Williams," Martina Navratilova said yesterday, moments after quoting Nelson Mandela's view of sports as a tool to inspire during a ceremony for the Laureus World Sports Awards. "The women have a lot more power than they think they have. They just need to unite."
It's not easy to come together in an individual sport, yet Nascar drivers and pro golfers appear to manage successfully. Granted, they are more mature upon entry, but if the young ladies aren't careful, they risk morphing into the men's tour, the ATP.
Four years ago, the ATP leaders were giddy after laying an unprotected smooch on their new partner, the Swiss marketing company ISL, by signing a 10-year, $1.2 billion deal.
One problem. The ATP's chief, Mark Miles, failed to inspect the horizon for an iceberg. Not engaged with the process, the players never looked either. By 2001, ISL went bankrupt. By 2002, the men's prize money started shrinking, their popularity began plummeting and their TV ratings were withering.
Suddenly, a passive player body awoke. But is it too late to leverage their star power? Over the past few weeks, a breakaway group has been formed by several of the top players, including Lleyton Hewitt, Roger Federer, James Blake and Marat Safin, all of whom have signed on with the International Men's Tennis Association. 
"They feel isolated from their own tour," said Rob Freeman, a lawyer with Brown Raysman, who is representing the I.M.T.A. "They see that with men's tennis, everything is going in a straight line down."
Hello, ladies, you could be next. During the ga-ga age of Anna Kournikova, throughout the early stages of the Williams sisters' arrival, the women's tour squandered its capital through mismanagement and player indifference.
It's not enough for Serena, Venus and Anna to be seen as regulars on the photo-shoot scene. After all, looks can take a gal only so far. They need to be heard on the issues concerning the health of their sport. In truth, Lindsay Davenport is about the only player who keeps up with the internal machinations of the Tour. One voice does not make an advocacy group. 
If the players want a two-month off-season, if they want the majors to begin with the Australian Open in March and end with the United States Open in September, if they want the Tour to have more control of tournaments, if they want a stronger leadership, all they have to do is say so.
After all, it's always request hour for a superstar. As Capriati knows, all you have to do is ask. The response is bound to be, "For you, ladies, the moon."

HEADLINE: Risking House and Credit; 
Home Equity Borrowing Rises to Worrisome Levels

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Americans are borrowing against their homes at unprecedented levels, leading some bankruptcy lawyers and consumer advocates to warn that many people could wind up losing their houses.
 Homeowners raised $130 billion last year through home equity loans and lines of credit, nearly double the total a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve. 
 This boom in borrowing comes at a time when housing prices nationwide are still strong, even in places like the New York metropolitan area where prices have risen sharply.
As long as their home values rise, borrowers who are having trouble making their payments can take out further loans or can sell their homes for more than they owe. Indeed, people have not fallen behind on their home equity loans nationwide in troubling numbers. 
But in parts of the Midwest and the Southeast where home prices have softened, delinquencies on home equity debt have started to rise, and bankruptcy lawyers are reporting that a growing number of their clients are losing their homes to the banks.
"I'm representing a large number of newly homeless people," said Barbara May, a bankruptcy lawyer in St. Paul. Many of these people have taken on home equity loans in addition to their existing mortgages.
"We are just buried in foreclosures," she said.
Bankruptcy lawyers warn that the problem could spread to other parts of the country if home prices soften or if the economy does not improve.
Homeowners eager to lower their monthly payments have refinanced their mortgages in great numbers over the last year, often taking cash out to maintain or increase their spending.
On top of that come their other loans. Home equity loans or lines of credit can be a good way to pay off credit card debt, since they carry rates that are on average less than half those on credit cards. And the interest on a home equity loan is tax-deductible, while that on credit card debt is not.
The Federal Reserve says a significant portion of all home equity borrowing goes to pay off high-rate card debt. More than half of these funds come from lines of credit extended by banks and other savings institutions.
Banks have been particularly active in extending this debt over the last three years. Total outstanding bank credit lines more than doubled, to $216.9 billion, as of January, according to an analysis of Fed data by Economy.com, a research company in West Chester, Pa. By contrast, credit card and other revolving credit rose just 19 percent over the same period.
Despite the surge, bankers say that consumers seem far from the end of their run. Richard M. Kovacevich, chief executive of Wells Fargo, one of the nation's biggest home equity lenders, estimated at an investor conference in January that Americans could still borrow against $6.6 trillion in "untapped equity" in their homes.
And Doreen Woo Ho, president of the consumer credit group at the bank, said, "We feel that the home is an asset that consumers can use."
Banks have made it so easy for people to borrow against their homes that some people may be borrowing more than they need. Many Americans are using this debt to finance a variety of projects, from fixing up their homes to buying cars.
When David Cole and his wife were planning their daughter's wedding last fall, a neighbor suggested that they take out a home equity line to pay for it. A couple of weeks later, Mr. Cole, a 54-year-old actor from Morro Bay, Calif., was approved for a credit line up to $80,000 by Washington Mutual.
The process was so easy, he said, that "we ended up taking more than we needed to cover the cost of the wedding." 
Mr. Cole said he would be careful about drawing on the credit line, aware that this sort of debt "is tied to your home." But given the low variable rate, currently 4.25 percent, he and his wife may use it to buy new cars and replace the roof on their home.
Such spending, fueled by borrowing against homes, has given the economy a boost at a time when spending by businesses is weak. The Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said in a speech early this month, "The ready availability of home equity for extraction appears to have played a substantial and independent role in prompting additional household expenditures."
Some consumer credit specialists now worry that many people are taking on more debt than they can handle. Even after using the money raised from their home's equity to pay down debt, some people then go out and run up balances again on their credit cards.
Lawyers say they are coming across people who have lost their jobs and are using both credit card and home equity debt in an attempt to stay out of bankruptcy.
"They are still winding up in bankruptcy, but a year or two later," said Norma Hammes, a bankruptcy lawyer in San Jose, Calif. "They are just delaying the inevitable."
Those people who fail to make payments on the home loans or credit lines could wind up in more serious trouble in a bankruptcy than if they just had credit card debt. In a bankruptcy, individuals can often write off their unpaid credit card balances. But home equity loans and other mortgage debt must be repaid, or the bank can seize the property.
While credit card lenders can sue a borrower and request a lien on the person's home, such judgments are generally not enforceable after a person files for bankruptcy, Ms. Hammes said. And in certain states, a home cannot be seized by creditors as long as it is worth some amount more than the value of its mortgage debt.
So far, the share of consumers nationwide who have fallen behind on home equity payments is relatively small. Indeed, for every $1,000 in such credit lines, just $7.30 in loans was past due by at least 30 days as of last September, compared with $14.40 a decade earlier. 
Given the sharp rise in this debt recently, it may take a couple of years for trouble on many of these loans to become apparent, bankruptcy lawyers said. That is because it usually takes some time for the borrower to use up the cash he raised by taking on the home equity debt.
But in states where housing prices are flat or rising more slowly, delinquencies are rising, according to Mark M. Zandi, the chief economist at Economy.com.
In North Carolina, for instance, where home prices are virtually flat, delinquencies of 30 days or more rose sharply from the second to the third quarter of last year, the most recent data available. Consumers have fallen behind on about $7 of every $1,000 borrowed, up from a delinquency rate of nearly $5 for every $1,000 borrowed just three months earlier.
William Brewer Jr., a bankruptcy lawyer in Raleigh, N.C., says he is seeing many cases where the value of the mortgage debt on homes exceeds the value of the property.
He described a client who lost his job at WorldCom after the company filed for bankruptcy protection. After months of being unemployed, the client reluctantly took a lower-paying job. He could not keep up with payments on his first mortgage and home equity loan, which together amounted to $220,000 -- or $20,000 more than his home was then worth.
Had the home's value been rising, he could have sold the property and avoided bankruptcy. Instead, Mr. Brewer's client was forced to file for bankruptcy and turn over his house to lenders.
"A lot of sins are covered up when property values are rising," Mr. Brewer said. 
Other states where home values are rising at a slower pace and home equity delinquencies are increasing include Oklahoma -- where delinquencies increased by nearly four times in the third quarter, to a rate of almost $25 of every $1,000 in loans, along with Indiana, Ohio and Washington.
In the New York area, where home prices remain strong, at least one banking executive is wary. John Kanas, chief executive of the North Fork Bancorporation, said he was making few home equity loans. 
Mr. Kanas said he had always found the process of foreclosing on a home to be cumbersome and unpleasant, but he is particularly nervous now, given the tremendous rise in home prices on Long Island, where North Fork is based. Last year, home prices in Nassau and Suffolk counties rose 26 percent, the biggest increase in the nation.
"Home equity financings are a bet on the future value of real estate," Mr. Kanas said. If housing prices fall or rise at a slower pace, individuals would have a harder time repaying home equity debt.
A consumer who mostly has unsecured debt can seek protection under Chapter 7 of theUnited States Bankruptcy Code, in which virtually all debts can be wiped out. The ease through which someone can shed credit card debts in a Chapter 7 filing has prompted the credit card issuers to push -- without success, so far -- for Congress to tighten the bankruptcy laws.
A person who falls behind on his mortgage payments and wants to keep his house needs to file under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code. He would still be able to write off most of his credit card debt, but to save his house, he would need to pay off his mortgage loans within a few years.
The amount of mortgage debt for some people is so great that lawyers like Ms. May are advising clients to walk away from their homes rather than try to repay the debt.
"For many people, the value of the first and second mortgage is more than their salary," she said. "There's way too much debt on their house for them to catch up."
Even if home prices do not fall nationwide, a sharp reversal in prices in some local markets could make it hard for borrowers to pay off their mortgage debt. It could also be bad for some banks, which have become increasingly dependent on home equity loans to bolster profits. Wells Fargo had extended $36 billion in home equity loans nationwide at the end of last year, a 41 percent increase from the end of 2001.
While a bank can try to recoup its money by foreclosing on a home, that process can be time-consuming, said Abigail Wickham, a lawyer in Melville, N.Y., who deals with foreclosures for North Fork, among other banks. "In New York, it can sometimes take years," she said. And if the price of the house is less than the size of the outstanding mortgage debt, the lender will suffer a loss.
But Ms. Ho of Wells Fargo said the bank's home equity financings already take into account the possibility of a decline in property values.
While Wells Fargo will occasionally lend based on 100 percent of the value of a home, on average these days it is lending amounts closer to 75 percent of a house's value.
"In order for delinquencies to rise," Ms. Ho said, "there would have to either be a dramatic increase in unemployment or a dramatic burst in housing prices. We don't see either of those things happening." 
Consumer advocates say they are worried that Americans are squandering their most stable asset at a time when retirement savings are already dwindling. "At a time when Social Security and pensions are already at risk," said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the Consumer Federation of America, "this is a disturbing trend."

Consumer Confidence Falls To Lowest Level Since 1993
Consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level in almost 10 years this month, the Conference Board reported. That may make it a great time to buy stocks.
 In only four previous times in the history of the survey, which dates to 1967, has the index plunged as low as 62.5. In each case, the move came when the stock market had been weak but was poised to rise the next year.
Floyd Norris: Market Place. Page C7.

Sales of existing homes were brisk in February, the National Association of Realtors said. Homes sold at an annual pace of 5.84 million units, down from 6.1 million in January. C7.

Stocks moved moderately higher. The Dow rose 65.55 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 8,280.23. The Nasdaq composite index gained 21.23 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,391.01, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index increased 10.51 points, or 1.2 percent, to 874.74. C7.

PERSON: Morton A. Klein 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
In Favor of the War, and Enjoying a Good Fight

BYLINE:  By DANIEL J. WAKIN 

 BODY:
FOR 12 years, Morton A. Klein has been a one- or two-issue kind of man: brook no peace with the Palestinian leadership, ferret out anti-Semitism wherever it is.
 Mr. Klein is president of the Zionist Organization of America, so such views come as no surprise. He took a slight detour on Sunday, heading to Times Square to take part in a rally supporting the war against Iraq. By itself, that may not be so surprising, given that Iraq is an enemy of Israel. 
 But his new role becomes more interesting when one realizes that Mr. Klein has emerged as one of the few people to take a lead in organizing public displays of pro-war sentiment in New York City, where some of the nation's largest antiwar demonstrations have been held. He is also one of the few Jewish leaders to take a prominent public stand on the war.
In an interview at his office near Herald Square, where he commutes three days a week from his home in a Philadelphia suburb, Mr. Klein sees nothing out of the ordinary.
"We are focused on issues relating to the Middle East," he said. "We have become very knowledgeable about the Arab world, the Arab war on Israel and terrorism. We are patriotic American citizens who believe this is a just and valid war." 
As he speaks, his eyebrows perform a pas de deux above his glasses, and quick bursts of air sound from his nose -- the products of a mild case of Tourette's syndrome, for which this owlish-looking former statistician begs pardon. He is disarmingly self-deprecating. 
The demonstration drew about 1,000 people, a footnote to the more than 125,000 people who the police estimated marched against the war a day earlier. The pro-war rally's other main sponsor was the Christian Coalition of America. Mr. Klein, who addressed the pro-war demonstration, said he became involved when a politically conservative Web site, whose name he could not recall, contacted him. "We felt we should lend our name to this," he said. "This is not really a leap."
It is a leap not taken by many of the more mainstream Jewish groups, which have largely remained silent on the war. Jewish leaders have said the silence comes partly because their organizations are divided, and partly because they fear repercussions if the war goes badly.
In the backdrop has been much public discussion, at least in the weeks before military action began, about whether or not a group of prominent Jews in foreign-policy circles were responsible for pushing the administration to war, and whether even to raise the issue was anti-Semitic.
Mr. Klein said he found it troubling that Jewish leaders would have hesitation speaking out. But, he added, given so much persecution, "Jews understandably have a fear of making things worse."
Mr. Klein, who is married and the father of a grown daughter, was born in 1947 in Germany, at a displaced persons camp. His parents, both Holocaust survivors, met there. The family came to the United States when he was 4, and he grew up in South Philadelphia. He studied math and economics at Temple University, where he also received his master's degree concentrating on biostatistics.
He actively protested the Vietnam War, grew his hair long and worked for George McGovern's presidential campaign in 1972. "I was young and idealistic," he said. "When you get older, you realize it doesn't work." 
Mr. Klein became a health economist in the Nixon, Ford and Carter administrations. Around that time, he befriended the scientist Linus Pauling, and served as his research consultant for 15 years. In 1991, Mr. Klein became head of the Philadelphia chapter of the Zionist organization, and the group's national president two years later.
THERE is an iconoclastic strain to the life of a man whom Abraham H. Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, once called an "attack dog of the Jewish thought police."
Mr. Klein drew attention in the mid-1970's for research suggesting that cancer survival rates were not improving despite what were considered broad advances in treatment. In 1992, he was listed as a co-author of a major study suggesting the consumption of large quantities of vitamin C may lower death rates from heart disease. 
His was a relatively rare voice from the outset in the American Jewish community against the Oslo peace accord.
A prolific speechmaker and Congressional lobbyist, he is the son of a rabbi who memorized the Torah as a youth. Mr. Klein absorbed some of that talent. In his youth, Mr. Klein said, he knew by heart the batting averages of virtually every major leaguer.
While criticizing others for comparing the plight of Palestinians in Israel with that of the Jews in Nazi Germany, Mr. Klein does not shrink from using the Nazi analogy himself. He said "militant Islamic terrorism is the greatest threat to a peaceful and free world since the Nazis," but quickly conceded that the Soviet Union could compete. He also said Arab culture promoted hatred and violence toward Jews in the same way that Nazi culture did.
Not surprisingly, Mr. Klein's critics fault him for seeing the world in black and white terms and for smearing his enemies. He denies the charges, but also indirectly responds with an anecdote about Dr. Pauling. He said he once asked Dr. Pauling how he felt about his critics.
Mr. Klein said the scientist answered, "If they weren't fighting against me, what fun would that be?"

HEADLINE: Hurdle for 'Video Lottery' At New Jersey Racetracks 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT HANLEY 

 BODY:
A proposal to install video "lottery machines" at New Jersey racetracks suffered a setback yesterday, as the McGreevey administration said that a state commission studying the issue would not finish its work by a May deadline.
 The panel, officials said, needs more time to examine complex economic, legal and policy questions raised by the proposal. The machines resemble slot machines, which the state prohibits anywhere but in Atlantic City casinos. 
 The state's mayors have led the effort to install the lottery machines at racetracks as a way to help bridge the state's $5 billion budget gap, control property tax increases and allow tracks to offer bigger purses to horse owners and trainers. The proposal has run into stiff opposition from the Atlantic City casinos and lawmakers from that area, but Gov. James E. McGreevey has helped keep the idea alive by ordering a state study. 
When he created the eight-member commission early last month, Mr. McGreevey gave the group 90 days to complete its review and asked it to submit a report by May 4. That timetable was too ambitious, the governor's spokesman, Micah Rasmussen, said yesterday.
"The commission is not at a point where we'll have a resolution this year," Mr. Rasmussen said. "The complexity of the issue demands it has a thorough discussion. That hard look is going to take longer than 90 days. The governor wanted a thorough and extensive review before any attempt to move forward."
No new deadline has been set for completion of the study, Mr. Rasmussen said.
The commission's chairman, former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, said he welcomed the additional time. He said he was not certain the commission had the authority to meet its charge of providing an opinion on the legality of the video terminals. He also said that the full panel had not met since its initial organizational meeting and that it had received little information about the terminals beyond material about how beneficial they are in other states.
But another member of the commission, Mayor Chris Bollwage of Elizabeth, seemed startled by the administration's decision. "This is going to take everyone by surprise," he said. "Sometimes this administration reaches decisions in its sleep and never tells anyone else."
Mayor Bollwage, a Democrat like Governor McGreevey, said that he had met late Monday in Trenton with state treasury officials to discuss the terminals and that no one had mentioned a deadline extension.
Mr. Bollwage said he served on a commission subcommittee dealing with policy issues. Matters discussed on Monday, he said, included the possibility of softening the casino industry's strong opposition to the terminals by giving it a hand in running them and a share of the proceeds.
The casino industry praised the governor's decision.
"It was a wise choice," Dennis C. Gomes, the president of the Casino Association of New Jersey, said in a statement. "We are opposed to building casinos at racetracks in New Jersey. We will maintain that opposition in the event that the threat resurfaces in the future."
Mr. Rasmussen, the governor's spokesman, said that Mr. McGreevey had always been neutral on the issue of the terminals. Nonetheless, supporters of the idea were encouraged earlier this year when Mr. McGreevey created the study commission, and some administration officials speculated that the terminals could generate up to $500 million a year.
The casino industry maintains that the state Constitution allows casino-style gambling only in Atlantic City, but supporters say the machines amount to a lottery rather than traditional slot gambling.The machines operate like lottery games, similar to "instant winner" scratch cards.
A bill pending in the State Senate would allow the terminals at the tracks by having them administered by the State Lottery Commission. The sponsor, Joseph Suliga, a Democrat of Middlesex County, said he needed the governor's support to win passage of the measure. But, he said, Mr. McGreevey's new decision on the study commission had no direct bearing on his measure.
Senator Suliga said he believed the terminals could produce $800 million a year for education aid. His bill would also set aside 10 percent of terminal earnings for the horse racing industry.
"My job is to persuade people this $800 million is critical to the state," Senator Suliga said.

HEADLINE: ON EDUCATION; 
Little-Known Jewel Of Lower East Side

BYLINE:  By Michael Winerip 

 BODY:
PUBLIC SCHOOL 20 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan is one of the poorest elementary schools in America (99 percent free lunches), but also one of the most thrilling. Many of the children live in tenements, come from broken homes, move from apartment to apartment. Yet they made so much improvement on their state test scores in the last four years (from 27 percent reading at grade level to 51 percent) that the state education commissioner himself sent a special letter commending their braininess.
 Cheng Liu, a fourth grader who was in three schools before P.S. 20, noticed the difference right away. "This school has lots of teachers," he says. "Like music, like art, like computer, and there's speech and dance and even more I can't think of." 
 When Dario Gonzalez, a shy boy, arrived in September, he was surprised that this was a school where the fourth-grade teacher had time to talk to him personally. "Before, I don't know how to organize my stuff, I don't really know how to write a paragraph or anything, they don't tell me that stuff," he says. "Miss Torres told me how to put in one idea, about punctuation, everything like that."
Ronald Moran knew he wasn't reaching his potential, because his sixth-grade teacher, Jerry Kerne, told him. "I should have 80's because my teacher said. He had high expectations for me. Everybody did." Yet Ronald was getting 60's and worse. "My vocabulary tests, 50's." Ronald likes Mr. Kerne a lot. "He gives you a lot of chances. He don't scream so much." But for reasons no one could explain, in class Ronald was angry, edgy, impatient.
Fortunately, at P.S. 20 there are extra adults around to help a classroom teacher. It was the music teacher, Willie Mack, who unlocked Ronald. A trumpet was the key. Ronald took lessons at school, and Mr. Mack gave him a trumpet to take home. After school now, Ronald slips into the fifth-floor stairwell leading to the roof of his building and practices "One Note Samba." 
"If I'm doing some wrong stuff, I take the trumpet and it eases me," Ronald says. "I can use the trumpet to release me." Lately, people around P.S. 20 have noticed, Ronald's a new Moran. "I started learning to take things more easy," he says. "Instead of 50's and 60's, I'm getting 80's -- 70's, the lowest."
P.S. 20 is one of those little-known jewels of the New York City public school system, although the people who make their living delivering quality education to poor children know. Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric with the big-bucks lifestyle, may get front-page news coverage for helping the city with its new principals' training institute. But with no press coverage at all, P.S. 20's principal of 26 years, Dr. Leonard Golubchick (Dr. G) recently attracted 45 principals from all over the city to his school for a daylong seminar on how it's really done.
Dr. G talks about how he finds extra local, state and federal money to hire additional teachers and integrate the arts into the curriculum, thereby avoiding mindless drilling, captivating even wiggly little boys like Cheng, Dario and Ronald, improving their language skills and raising test scores. 
He talks about the grants he found to hire two dozen substitutes and free his classroom teachers for a daylong reading seminar by P.S. 20's full-time literacy specialist, Jan Colucci. He gave the 45 principals a tour of the Learning Fair that his children worked on for two months, featuring computerized PowerPoint presentations on famous New Yorkers, New York architecture and the new designs for the World Trade Center site.
But of all the tricks he's learned, by far the most important is reducing class size. "The first line of defense," he preaches. "My philosophy is you can't have a good education with 30 to 35 per classroom." It is no coincidence, he says, that P.S. 20's test scores have gone up since 1999, the first year of a state program that provided $140 million to reduce classroom size in elementary grades across the state. 
Before the legislation, two-thirds of New York City children in Grades K-3 were in classes of more than 25; now one-quarter are. This was badly needed in New York, which has the 10th-largest elementary-class sizes among the 50 states.
Sadly, the best education reform Dr. G has seen in 38 years as an educator is about to be killed. Like most states, New York is facing harsh economic times, with little hope of help from a federal government that also has a war to fight. Gov. George E. Pataki says he has no choice but to kill the class-size program. And he is not alone. In flush times, 32 states passed class-size legislation; now many, including Florida and California, are moving to roll it back.
Who cares? 
Joan Kane, a fifth-grade teacher who has 26 students but used to have 35. "The difference?" she says. "I know the kids. I know what to do for them. With 35, I tried, but I got overwhelmed."
Mr. Mack says: "I remember 34 to 36. I didn't have enough chairs."
One of the thrilling things about P.S. 20 is that so much has been achieved in a school where English is not the native language for 52 percent of students. The school is 54 percent Hispanic, 39 percent Asian. 
April Yee remembers having 32 children in her first-grade Chinese bilingual class; now she has 24. So when Zun Han Zheng races up with his essay on spring, she has time to read it on the spot.
Zun Han wrote: "I likes spring so much. I don't want the spring to go. I can fuy a kite, smim, and I play in the park. I has lot of fun."
"You've edited?" Ms. Yee asks.
"I edited it already," Zun Han says, and Ms. Yee eyeballs him. With 24 students, it's like smimming upstream, trying to sneak one by on Ms. Yee.

HEADLINE: Universities Exporting M.B.A. Programs Via the Internet 

BYLINE:  By OTTO POHL 

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
If Jeremy Hallett had his way, he would be sitting on a leafy university campus in the United States with plenty of time to contemplate the theories of business.
 Instead, he spends hectic lunch hours and long evenings in his office cubicle here, earning his M.B.A. 
 "It's not a perfect world," he says with a shrug.
Driven by the mantra of globalization and enabled by Internet-based technologies, M.B.A. programs in the United States are expanding rapidly into new markets overseas. The schools are looking for full-time, on-campus students seeking an international M.B.A. degree as well as part-timers like Mr. Hallett, who want to learn from afar while they continue working. 
Some of the universities are virtual, offering American degrees via the Internet. Mr. Hallett, a London-based senior vice president at Thomson Financial, is earning his M.B.A. from Cardean University, a newly created entity that exists only in cyberspace and markets a course package created by other institutions, including Stanford, Columbia and the University of Chicago.
For Mr. Hallett, it was the availability of these prestigious schools on his computer screen that persuaded him to enroll. "These schools are recognized around the world," he said. "This degree will be truly international."
The M.B.A. is an American creation. More than 100,000 students are enrolled in M.B.A. programs in the United States, and now tens of thousands more are enrolled overseas. Even the threat of global recession has not diminished its popularity, as unemployed workers sharpen their job skills. 
The biggest growth opportunity today for American online universities is inside the United States, but the schools are also looking to carry the prestige of American education overseas.
"We're serving a global market," said Andrew Rosenfield, the founder and chairman of Cardean University. A third of Cardean's students are outside the United States, and he expects the proportion to grow significantly over time.
"The United States certainly has no monopoly on running successful businesses," he says, adding that business students have to get their training somewhere.
Traditional campus-based programs are looking to train them as well. Columbia formed a partnership with the London Business School, and the Stern School of Business at New York University recently inaugurated the Trium M.B.A. degree with the London School of Economics and H.E.C. Paris. Thunderbird, an M.B.A. program in Arizona that bills itself as the oldest international M.B.A. program in the world, established its own satellite campus in France last fall.
These programs are designed to appeal to executives who want globally recognized names on their resumes.
Lawrence Naested, an American Express executive in London, is enrolled in the Trium program, studying in places like Hong Kong, Paris, Brazil, and New York. "This is far and away superior to a traditional M.B.A. program," he says. "Mixing with different backgrounds and nationalities far outweighs spending a year in a book."
Even schools that are very careful about diluting their brand names are looking for new growth opportunities. The Harvard Business School is keeping its campus-based education sacrosanct while offering noncredit Harvard-branded education to managers who can tap into a database for answers to specific questions. Instead of teaching what may be needed one day, they offer continuous assistance to managers confronted with real-life situations. 
"We're moving from just-in-case education to just-in-time education," says Jonathon D. Levy, vice-president of online learning solutions at Harvard Business School Publishing, a subsidiary of the Harvard Business School.
This wealth of new business models centered on education has caught the eye of investors. "Very solid returns, solid profits, and good cash flow," says Richard Close, a vice president of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, summing up why he feels for-profit post-secondary education is a great investment opportunity. "Online, you can leverage that success even more."
Most of the online universities are hoping to emulate the success of the University of Phoenix, whose growth is one of the most remarkable stories in for-profit academia. The university, with 140,000 students, has become the largest university in the country in terms of enrollment. About 60,000 of those students attend classes online and 4,000 are overseas. The stock of Apollo Group, which owns the university, has kept pace, rising 500 percent since January 2000. 
There have also been plenty of failures. Many online programs founded during the Internet boom did little but hemorrhage money. Pensare, an online M.B.A. company using Duke courses, has been scrapped. Quisic, an online program developed with the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth, was closed.last year, and SUNY Buffalo had an online M.B.A. program that lasted only 18 months. 
Administrators of campus-based programs believe the failure of many online programs highlights the importance of extensive classroom time and personal interaction. And while few of those involved with online degrees dispute the superiority of full-time, face-to-face learning, they point to the much larger market of those who would like an education but cannot quit their jobs or travel to a campus.
Unlike elite campus-based programs, which offer exclusivity along with the degree, the online programs accept anyone with a good credit history and a reasonable likelihood of finishing the program. The online programs are expensive -- Cardean's M.B.A. costs $24,000 -- but that is still much less than a program like Trium, which costs $92,000.
The success of the American M.B.A. overseas already has some foreign schools marketing themselves as alternatives. "We reflect an Anglo-American way of doing business," says Mark Fenton-O'Creevy, the director of the British Open University Business School master's program.
But no nationality or new technology makes getting a job easier these days. Sarah Ferguson, an Open University student, was excited to hear that an American reporter was writing about M.B.A.'s. "Can you mention that I'm looking for a job in the States?" she asked.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: DESERT WELLS; 
War Fails to Halt Iraqi Oil Production, but Prompts a Debate About the Future

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE and FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
When the war began, it looked as if Iraq's oil production would come to a halt. But Iraq's massive Kirkuk field in the north is still pumping oil and piping it to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, where storage tanks are filling up.
 At a time when worldwide stocks of crude oil are low and prices are volatile, petroleum shipments from Iraq could help calm oil markets, some industry experts say. But exports from Ceyhan have been delayed because of a dispute in the United Nations Security Council that could be the beginning of a protracted fight over the future of Iraq's oil wealth, diplomats and oil industry experts say. 
 On one side are the United States and Great Britain; on the other are Russia and Syria. The debate focuses on the seven-year-old oil-for-food program, under which the United Nations established Iraq's oil export quota and authorized that the oil revenues be used for relief. The debate stems from suspicions that a resolution drafted by Secretary General Kofi Annan, reauthorizing the program, might be a backdoor way of legitimizing the war and bypassing the existing Iraqi government. It could also lead to the cancellation of billions of dollars in existing contracts, as contracts for food and medicine are given priority over those for other goods on the way to Iraq from places like Russia.
"We don't want a decision by the Council to go even faster and be ahead of the events on the ground," Sergey Lavrov, the Russian envoy to the United Nations, said in a recent interview.
Iraq has the second largest oil reserves in the world, after Saudi Arabia, and the Bush administration has made restoration of the oil industry the cornerstone for the revival of the economy in a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. 
Yesterday the administration pushed a demand that revenues from the oil-for-food program be made available to the United States to buy supplies for Iraq. 
Andrew S. Natsios, the director of the United States Agency for International Development, said the administration needed the United Nations Security Council to "make a decision in the next few days" that would give the United States access to as much as $8 billion held in a United Nations escrow account. Security Council ambassadors are scheduled to consult on the oil-for-food issue today. 
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell also reiterated at a news briefing yesterday the need for a Security Council resolution covering the program and said the administration was still discussing with other countries the role the United Nations would play in postwar Iraq.
Oil industry experts assumed Iraqi oil production would be widely shut down in light of the suspension within Iraq of the oil-for-food program. The resolution drafted by the secretary general authorizes United Nations officials to directly manage the program. Before last week, Iraqi government agencies had much of the responsibility, under close United Nations supervision.
But oil-for-food was not suspended in the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, and United Nations inspectors under the program remain there, according to Ian Steele, a spokesman for the program.
The last shipment of oil from Ceyhan occurred last Thursday, Mr. Steele said. Before the war, Iraq pumped 700,000 to 750,000 barrels of oil a day to Ceyhan from Kirkuk. But the Iraqi government has since reduced the flow of oil so that the storage tanks at the port do not fill up, which, in turn, would compel the Iraqis to halt production at Kirkuk. The Ceyhan storage tanks hold between 7 and 10 million barrels of oil, according to various industry estimates. 
Oil traders said they had received reports that banks would no longer provide letters of credit to buyers of Iraqi oil, a reluctance they say they do not understand, given Ceyhan's distance from the fighting.
Some traders and diplomats pointed instead to the dispute within the United Nations, saying that the confusion over the continuation of oil-for-food has effectively suspended the program in Ceyhan. The suspicions on both sides reflect the lingering mistrust left after the abortive effort to win Security Council approval for a resolution approving military action. 
The anger over oil-for-food boiled over in an experts' meeting Monday, when the United States representative, Andrew Hillman, complained to his Russian counterpart that the Russian arguments were delaying aid shipments to suffering people.
The Russian, Sergey Khazilov, shot back that the suffering was being caused by American bombs, said a diplomat who was present. A spokesman for the United States mission denied that the exchange took place.
For the United States and Britain, the legal objections being made by Russia and Syria mean a frustrating delay in reauthorizing a program which, even before the war, provided for the basic needs of about 60 percent of the Iraqi population of 24 million people. 
But for Russia and Syria, both members of the Security Council, legal issues involved are just as crucial. The draft resolution allows for the secretary general's representatives to do their relief work "in coordination with the relevant authorities," a phrase that seems to anticipate the fall of the current government.
Mr. Lavrov said, "The legal consequences and political consequences" of a resolution could be to circumvent international law, which requires "occupying belligerents" to make reparations for the damages caused in the conflict. 
To use funds generated by Iraqi oil for relief after an American-led war, the Russians and Syrians say, is equivalent to making Iraqis pay for their own aid.
But one Security Council diplomat argued that the Russians failed to see the point: "It does seem that they don't feel any particular urgency about taking measures that would improve the situation."

GRAPHIC: Chart/Diagram: "Extinguishing Oil Well Fires"Snuffing out well fires can take months. Intense heat and poison gases make conditions extremely hazardous for workers. Surface ruptureHere is one of several methods for stopping an oil or gas fire at a failed wellhead that can no longer contain the wells pressure. 1. ASSEMBLE EQUIPMENTWorkers bring bulldozers and cranes to the site, and install water tanks or wells, water pits and metal sheds to protect from fire heat. 2. REMOVE WELLHEADA cutting device attached to the crane slices off the broken wellhead using jets of sand and water. 3. CLEAR SITEDebris is removed; a large tube is placed over well to force the fire above workers. 4. DIVERT THE FIREWith flames roaring overhead, workers prepare the well for a new cap. The tube is removed and the cap is maneuvered into place by crane. Long ground-level pipes are attached, diverting the fire far away from the site. 5. PLUG THE WELLA mudmixing plant is built nearby. Mud is pumped into the well, temporarily plugging it. The well may be repaired or filled with cement and abandoned. Oil fires in the first gulf war were deliberately set by sabotaging wellheads.TIME NEEDED TO PLUG WELL: 1-5 WEEKS Below-ground ruptureWells breached more than 20-30 feet below ground cannot be capped. One or more "relief wells" must be drilled to intercept the damaged one. 1. Oil and gas forced up through the ground makes a crater that fills withoil and catches fire. 2. One or two relief wells are drilled a safe distance from the fire. 3. In extreme cases, a third relief well could flood the oil reservoir with water, produce oil to reduce pressure or serve as backup. 4. Heavy mud and chemicals are pumped into the relief wells, plugging the original well where they intersect. 5. Concrete permanently plugs the well. Diagram highlights a typical site layout.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: WASHINGTON; 
U.S. Officials Say Iraqis May Have Killed Some American Prisoners

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT and DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
Some of the Army mechanics captured on Sunday after they took a wrong turn in the Iraqi town of Nasiriya were apparently executed by their captors, probably in front of townspeople, American officials charged tonight.
 The officials cautioned that the information was based on one source, apparently a communications intercept, and that they were seeking corroborating evidence. It is unclear how many of the seven soldiers were executed, rather than killed in fighting, as the Iraqis contend. Five other Americans were taken prisoner and at least three were still missing. 
 The accusations came a few days after a videotape of the prisoners and the dead soldiers was broadcast on Al Jazeera, the Arab satellite television network. It showed images of at least four bodies; some appeared to have bullet wounds to the head.
"When the full story comes out, people will be outraged," said one senior military official.
The accusations came at the end of a day in which senior White House and Pentagon officials accused the Iraqis of a number of war crimes, including feigning surrender and then shooting at American forces, and using a hospital as a staging area for military operations.
The White House also said that Iraqi paramilitary forces were preventing relief supplies from reaching Basra in southern Iraq.
At the Pentagon today, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard B. Myers, repeatedly defended their war plan against criticism that it had stretched ground forces too thin, leaving their rear areas vulnerable to guerrilla attacks by paramilitary forces.
"It's a good plan, and it is a plan that in four and a half or five days has moved ground forces to within a short distance of Baghdad," said Mr. Rumsfeld, after repeated exchanges with reporters. "And forces increase in the country every minute and every hour of every day," he said.
General Myers called the war plan "brilliant," saying any setbacks were due to Iraqi violations of the Geneva Convention. "It's a plan that's on track," he said. "It's a plan everybody had input to. It's a plan everybody agrees to."
A senior administration official who was deeply involved in war planning said in an interview today that President Saddam Hussein's loyalists "fight like terrorists," and attributed the absence of a welcome for American troops to "a reign of terror in some of these cities, with these paramilitary and special security organizations enforcing the same brutal terror they have been enforcing for years." 
"We haven't encountered large segments of the Iraqi population yet," the official cautioned.
The official said that Mr. Bush had decided to assume the Iraqi government "is still functioning." But the official compared the first six days of this war to the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, saying, "the surprise is the speed of our advance."
Despite the optimism at the Pentagon and the White House, today was the first day the administration found itself somewhat on the defensive about its strategy. 
The cause appeared to be the combination of unexpectedly fierce resistance around Basra, the lost convoy, and the effectiveness of the Republican Guard in warding off Apache attack helicopters with a curtain of small-arms fire.
Mr. Bush tried to show optimism this morning, when he traveled to the Pentagon for a briefing, but he cautioned: "We're fighting an enemy that knows no rules of law, that will wear civilian uniforms, that is willing to kill in order to continue the reign of fear of Saddam Hussein."
Later, his spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said that the delay in getting aid to southern Iraq was the fault of the Iraqi authorities. "We didn't expect the Iraqis to cease caring about their own people, to cease feeding their own people, to put up impediments to this humanitarian relief supplies," he said.
The White House also used Mr. Bush's visit to press Congress to pass a $74.7 billion appropriation to finance the war and reconstruction. The Office of Management and Budget made it clear that it was profitable for nations to be members of Mr. Bush's "coalition of the willing," even if some were only reluctantly willing.
Turkey, which denied American access to its bases to open a northern front against Iraq, would receive $1 billion in economic aid under Mr. Bush's plan, allowing it to get up to $8.5 billion loans or loan guarantees. 
Israel would also get $1 billion in direct military assistance and $9 billion in loan guarantees. Jordan would receive $700 million in economic aid, and Egypt $300 million in grants, allowing it to obtain up to $2 billion in loan guarantees.
President Bush's greatest ally in the war, Prime Minister Tony Blair, prepared to come to Washington on Wednesday for a summit meeting that the British leader said would focus not only on war strategy, but on "how we get America and Europe working again together as partners and not as rivals."
The disputes that marked the battle over a second resolution at the United Nations authorizing war -- an effort the United States, Britain and Spain abandoned -- have now given way to a new dispute over how to administer Iraq after the war.
The president's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, flew to New York yesterday to discuss that subject and Iraq's relief needs with Secretary General Kofi Annan.
The visit came as sharp disputes were arising among the members of an expert committee designated to shape a Security Council resolution reconstituting the oil-for-food program that was suspended on March 17 when the United Nations personnel were withdrawn from Iraq.
The dispute has delayed the authorization of new mechanisms for the distribution of relief aid, including about $2.4 billion worth of food and other supplies being sent to Iraq.
The diplomatic struggle, pitting Russia and Syria against the United States and Britain, focuses on control over contracting authority in the program and on whether the resolution would legitimize the military action after the fact.

HEADLINE: Britain Arrests Russian Expatriate Billionaire and a Colleague 

BYLINE:  By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 25 

 BODY:
The British police said today that they had arrested the self-exiled Russian billionaire Boris Berezovsky to start legal proceedings that could lead to his eventual extradition to Moscow to face fraud charges brought by the Russian authorities.
 The arrest illuminated the change in Mr. Berezovsky's fortunes since the 1990's, when he ranked among the most influential of so-called oligarchs at the Kremlin, engineering the destiny of presidents. 
 A police statement said Mr. Berezovsky was arrested on Monday with Yuli Dubov, a former chief executive of the Logovaz car company, on charges of fraud brought by Russia. "The charge alleges that between Jan. 1, 1994, and Dec. 31, 1995, they defrauded the administration of the Samara region of 60 billion rubles whilst being directors of Logovaz," the police said. At the average exchange rate for that period, 60 billion rubles was equal to about $18 million. Samara is in southern Russia, near Togliatti, which in Soviet times was the center of the country's auto industry. 
Mr. Berezovksy, 57, and Mr. Dubov, 54, were released and ordered to appear in court for preliminary hearings on April 2. Mr. Berezovsky's lawyer, Andrew Stephenson, said the arrest had taken place "by appointment" at a prearranged meeting with the police. 
Extradition proceedings in Britain can take years.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Berezovsky said he and Mr. Dubov had each been required to post $155,000 bail. He said he had been told by his lawyer five days ago that they had both been "invited" to visit the police to hear the Russian charges. "I have no doubt that it was politically motivated," he said, referring to the request for his extradition. "This year in December we have parliamentary elections, and I think Putin is not happy with that."
Russia asked for Mr. Berezovsky's extradition in November, a year after he arrived in Britain, seeking permanent residence, and two years after he fled Russia, claiming that fraud charges against him were part of a plot by President Vladimir V. Putin to silence him.
Mr. Berezovsky has accused Mr. Putin of knowing that the F.S.B. security services in Russia carried out bombings of apartment buildings in Russia in 1999, contrary to official allegations that Chechen separatists were responsible.
Mr. Berezovsky has told visitors that he believes that the British court system will vindicate him in protesting his innocence.
At the time Mr. Berezovsky arrived in Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair supposedly had close ties to Mr. Putin, but the relationship between Moscow and London has soured over the war in Iraq. Russia has been one of the most implacable opponents of the war, which is being led by an American-British alliance. 
While in Britain, Mr. Berezovsky, who remains wealthy, has angered Mr. Putin by seeking to organize an opposition political party and a human rights organization and has openly called for the Russian president's defeat at the polls. He has also paid the legal fees of Akhmed Zakayev, a Chechen leader held in Britain who also faces extradition proceedings.
The sequence from an initial request for extradition from a foreign country to the actual handing over of a suspect runs through six stages, and at four of them the case may be dismissed. The British home secretary must also rule on whether to initiate proceedings and, finally, whether to surrender the suspect.
Earlier this month, the high court in Britain approved a settlement in Mr. Berezovsky's libel suit against Forbes magazine.
The case related to his days as a tycoon in the 1990's as Russia emerged from the Soviet command economy into freewheeling capitalism, which enabled a few businessmen -- the so-called oligarchs -- to win great influence at the Kremlin and amass fortunes from the breakup and sale of huge state monopolies.
Mr. Berezovsky made his first fortune through the Logovaz car dealership and went on to build an empire spanning the media, the Aeroflot airline, oil and aluminum. In the process, his wealth and his control of broadcasting outlets enabled him to campaign for the 1996 re-election of President Boris Yeltsin and the election of Mr. Putin in 2000.
Later that year, though, the two men fell out, and Mr. Berezovsky left Russia. In an interview here in February, he estimated his fortune at about $3 billion, and he has enlisted high-powered public relations consultants and law firms to fight in his corner.

HEADLINE: Medicare Recipients Face 12.4% Rise in Premiums 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
Medicare beneficiaries face a large increase in premiums next year, and doctors' fees will probably be cut because Medicare spending surged unexpectedly last year, federal officials said today.
 Richard S. Foster, chief actuary of the Medicare program, estimated that the Medicare premium would rise to $66 a month, an increase of $7.30, or 12.4 percent, the largest increase in 11 years. 
 Medicare officials said they now estimated that the fees paid to doctors for treating Medicare patients would be cut 4.2 percent next year. 
Premiums charged to the elderly and the amounts paid to doctors are computed according to complex formulas set by law. 
The projected cut in doctors' fees is remarkable because President Bush just signed legislation to increase Medicare spending for doctors' services by $54 billion over 10 years.
A major purpose of the legislation was to avert cuts in doctors' fees like the one now being forecast.
The prospect of a pay cut for doctors creates a political problem for Mr. Bush and Congress. Medicare cut the average doctors' fee 5.4 percent last year, and many doctors say they cannot afford to take new Medicare patients if the government cuts their fees again.
Dr. Yank D. Coble Jr., president of the American Medical Association, said the impending cut showed that Medicare's formula for paying doctors was severely flawed.
"Under the formula," Dr. Coble said, "physicians are penalized if services to Medicare patients grow more rapidly than the gross domestic product. At times of slow economic growth, it is likely that Medicare spending on physician services will exceed the target and trigger cuts in physician payments. But the health care needs of America's seniors don't change with the ups and downs of the economy."
Medicare provides health care for 40 million elderly and disabled people. When spending on doctors' services increases, beneficiaries' premiums normally rise as well because the premiums are supposed to cover about one-fourth of the costs of the Medicare trust fund that pays doctors. 
Even when Medicare reduces the payment for each service, total Medicare spending for physician services can still rise if doctors perform more services, or more complex services for which the government pays more. That is what happened last year.
Medicare spent $45 billion on doctors' services last year, an increase of $3 billion, or 7 percent, from 2001, even though the average fee for each service was reduced. 
Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the Medicare program, said the fee cut was offset by "a stunning 8 percent increase in the volume" of doctors' services to Medicare patients last year.
Medicare pays doctors under a fee schedule that sets payment rates for more than 7,000 procedures.
Thomas L. Grissom, director of the federal Center for Medicare Management, said, "The estimated reduction in physician fee schedule rates for 2004 is due, in large part, to substantial growth in 2002 in the volume and intensity of physicians' services."
In other words, doctors are performing more procedures and tests.
The government previously said that doctors could expect increases in Medicare fees in 2004 and later years. But, Mr. Grissom said, "we now estimate physician fee schedule updates will be negative for 2004 to 2007," because spending for doctors' services grew more and the economy grew less than expected last year.
Members of Congress from both parties have promised to provide Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. But even without new benefits, the cost of the program is growing rapidly.
Mr. Foster, the chief actuary, itemized some of the increases in Medicare spending last year:
*Inpatient hospital care, up 10 percent, to $104.9 billion.
*Outpatient hospital services, up 10 percent, to $15.4 billion.
*Skilled nursing homes, up 9 percent, to $14.6 billion.
*Home health care, up 14 percent, to $10.5 billion.
*Durable medical equipment, including wheelchairs, up 20 percent, to $6.5 billion.
*Hospice, up 24 percent, to $4.6 billion.
In addition, Mr. Foster said, federal officials saw a rapid increase in hospital admissions for Medicare patients last year.
Caroline R. Steinberg, vice president of the American Hospital Association, said, "A lot of new technology makes surgery a better, safer option."
She mentioned, for example, the growing use of laparoscopic surgery, which requires just a few small incisions, and the implantation of wire-mesh devices known as stents, to prop open clogged arteries.

HEADLINE: Study Says Tax Cuts Will Make Deficit Soar 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
The Bush administration and Republican lawmakers, who have long argued that tax cuts can at least partly pay for themselves by speeding economic growth, heard some bad news today.
 In its first effort to estimate the economic effects of President Bush's proposed budget, including its plan for $726 billion in tax cuts, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that even counting any stimulus deficits would run more than $1 trillion over the next five years. 
 The shortfalls are essentially identical to the ones that Congressional analysts calculated through old-fashioned methods. 
"The overall macroeconomic effect of the proposals in the president's budget is not obvious," the budget office said.
The main reason, it added, is that cuts that might increase growth would be almost entirely offset by spending increases that would reduce it.
The report is a setback for the administration, which has justified a return to big deficits by contending that the best way to balance the budget is by increasing growth through tax cuts.
The report today was the first time that the budget office has accommodated Republican requests for "dynamic scoring" to estimate the effects of cuts, as opposed to traditional "static" approaches that estimate only the direct revenue effects.
It was prepared under the auspices of the office's new director, Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, who had been chief economist at Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.
Shortly after Mr. Bush announced his tax plan in January, the council published calculations that its main tax cuts would generate enough added economic growth to replace 40 percent of the revenues that would be lost.
Mr. Holtz-Eakin said the new analysis did not necessarily refute contentions about tax cuts, because the report examined the effects of Mr. Bush's spending increases, as well as his tax proposals.
"It's apples and oranges," Mr. Holtz-Eakin said today after testifying to the House Budget Committee. "We looked at the whole budget here."
Democratic lawmakers said the report vindicated their opposition to Mr. Bush's tax cuts at a time the government plans to spend at least $75 billion fighting in Iraq and incur a budget deficit this year that could exceed $400 billion.
"This throws cold water on all those people who thought there could be easy answers," said Representative Chet Edwards, Democrat of Texas.
Supporters of supply-side economics said the new analysis showed that Mr. Bush's spending plans would offset the growth generated by his tax cuts. 
"They did not analyze the impact of the tax cuts by themselves," said William Beach, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes to Reduce Bush's Tax Cut Plan 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
Capitalizing on concerns about the costs of war in Iraq, Senate Democrats won a vote today to reduce President Bush's proposed tax cut by half, a rare political defeat for a wartime president.
 The vote, 51 to 48 with three Republicans breaking ranks and voting against the president, complicates the prospects for enactment of the main element of his economic program, a $726 billion tax cut over 10 years. 
 The Senate's action showed the willingness of Democrats, even during a war, to challenge the president head-on over domestic priorities. And it was evidence of unease within the president's own party about cutting taxes in the face of rising budget deficits and the unknown cost of disarming, occupying and rebuilding Iraq. 
Senator George V. Voinovich of Ohio, one of the Republicans who voted to limit the tax cuts, said: "I happen to believe that we'll have to have troops in there for one year or two years. You're going to at least probably have to spend $2 billion a month next year or next budget just to provide security there."
The Senate move, an amendment limiting the tax cuts in the next decade to $350 billion, came on the day that President Bush formally asked Congress to give him nearly $75 million as a down payment on the cost of the war. 
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, the chief sponsor of the amendment, declared that reducing taxes by as much as Mr. Bush has proposed was not good public policy "when you have a $300 billion deficit, and then added on to that, we're at war and we don't know how much it's going to cost."
The chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Don Nickles, Republican of Oklahoma, countered that "We need to be growing our economy."
"The president," Mr. Nickles added, "has a package that would help create jobs, that would put people to work, that would encourage investment."
Today's vote came on one of a series of amendments to a budget measure meant to establish guidelines for the actual tax and spending legislation Congress will deal with later in the year. Two weeks ago, the House approved its budget measure with the full $726 billion in tax cuts the president sought.
Administration officials said today that the president and his allies would continue to fight for the full tax-cut package. "Let's see what the ultimate outcome is," said the White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. "That vote is not the final vote. There are many more to come." 
And Treasury Secretary John W. Snow told the National Association of Business Economics, "As a matter of principle, the administration believes we have an obligation to the American people to rebuild the economy while we protect our nation."
The Senate is expected to approve the overall measure, called a budget resolution, on Wednesday and send it to a conference with the House to reconcile the differences.
With the Senate and House controlled by Republicans, the conference committee is sure to be dominated by lawmakers loyal to President Bush. So the measure that comes out of the conference committee will probably be much more favorable to the president's position than what the Senate approved today and may include all or nearly all of the president's tax proposals.
Two of the Republicans who voted today to limit the tax cuts, Senators Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Mr. Voinovich of Ohio, said in interviews afterward that they would vote for the final budget plan that comes out of the conference regardless of the size of the tax cuts it allows. If they do, that will be sufficient to get the budget resolution adopted.
"We need a budget resolution," Ms. Snowe said. "The last message we need to send the American people is that we can't pass a budget framework so we can do our business during time of war."
Budget resolutions are not laws and in most cases are not binding but as a political matter, the final budget resolution this year is likely to establish a ceiling on the size of a tax cut that can be enacted.
The third Republican who voted to limit the tax cut was Lincoln D. Chafee of Rhode Island. One Democratic senator, Zell Miller of Georgia, favors the Bush tax cut, but he was absent for today's vote.
Last year, with the Senate controlled by Democrats and the House by Republicans, Congress was unable to agree on a budget resolution and the deadlock left lawmakers unable all year to deal with spending bills.
But even if the final budget measure contains most or even all of the president's tax plan, the vote today showed that the Senate might not be willing to go that far when it votes later on actual tax legislation.
The House Ways and Means Committee was set to draft and approve a tax bill this week. But the vote in the Senate today, leaving uncertain the size of the allowable tax cut, may cause the committee to postpone its meeting, a staff official said.
The part of the president's tax package that seems to be most in jeopardy is his proposal to eliminate the income tax owed by individuals on most stock dividends.
"This was a signal that there is not a lot of support for the dividend tax cut," Senator Breaux said. 
The critical vote today was cast by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina. Last week, Mr. Breaux offered a similar amendment that Mr. Hollings, who is opposed to any tax cut this year, refused to support on principle. Unlike most other Democrats, he refused to concede that half the Bush tax cut was preferable to all of it. 
Without his vote, the Breaux amendment was sure to be defeated. So many liberal Democrats switched and voted against the amendment.
Over the weekend, Mr. Breaux rewrote it specifically to appeal to Mr. Hollings, a strong supporter of Social Security. The new amendment specifies that most of the difference between $726 billion and $350 billion would be set aside in reserve to bolster the Social Security system.
Mr. Hollings had voted for such a proposal in the budget committee. In an interview after the vote this afternoon, he said he had changed positions from last week because "this is all funny money."
Budget resolutions are not binding, he said, and the important vote will come later when the Senate takes up actual tax legislation.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 27, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about the Senate's vote to reduce President Bush's proposed tax cut to $350 billion misstated the amount he also sought from Congress yesterday as a down payment on the cost of the war against Iraq. It was $75 billion, not million.

HEADLINE: How the President's $726 Billion Plan Was Cut in Half 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 25 

 BODY:
For months, the Democrats derided President Bush's tax cut, arguing that it was unfair. Then, as the war loomed, they argued that wartime was no time to cut taxes. But only today, after the cost of the war became evident in lives and dollars, did they successfully turn a popular president's war against him.
 In a form of political jujitsu, Democrats employed the growing unease about the war's effect on a shaky economy to reduce the president's $726 billion tax cut proposal by half. Though sentiment against the full tax cut had been building even before the fighting began, it seemed to crest today after Mr. Bush presented Congress with a costly war bill that represented only a first installment. 
 For senators who were already inclined to oppose tax cuts, the looming costs in Iraq gave a ready-made justification.
"The uncertainty of the war, the realization that we're operating with a deficit and not a surplus, are all factors that allowed us to pass a reduction in the size of the tax cut," said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana and sponsor of the amendment that reduced the tax cut. "This is certainly a reflection of the facts of the world that we live in today."
Democrats have had few victories against the administration since losing control of Congress in November, and their goal is to seize the momentum. Already, today, lawmakers urged that Congress double or triple the amount that the White House has allocated for spending on domestic security, reviving an issue that worked to their advantage before the war but seemed dormant once the fighting began.
Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, crowed of a "great victory" today, and vowed that this was only the beginning.
"We made a very irresponsible budget a little more responsible by cutting the tax cut," Mr. Daschle said. "We're now in a position to provide the kind of resources for deficit reduction, Social Security, Medicare and education that is so very critical."
The Democrats' exuberance may be premature. The president still gets a $350 billion tax cut, which is about $350 billion more than many Democrats would like. And that amount may grow substantially once negotiations begin with leaders of the House, who remain solidly behind the administration.
Even so, a blow was struck today. That it came with the assistance of three Republicans made it all the sweeter for the Democrats, who could claim bipartisan support. Those Republicans made it clear that they agreed with the concern that cruise missiles and tax cuts do not mix.
"I think the war has given everyone a more sober look at things than perhaps before," said Senator George V. Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, who voted with the Democrats.
Today's vote was precisely the outcome that Democrats hoped for last week when they delayed a final vote on the budget with a long series of amendments, betting that the president would have to request money for the war once it began. The request, formally submitted today, included no money for rebuilding Iraq after the war, and neither did the 2004 budget under debate today.
For many senators, approving such a budget with the full set of tax cuts was the equivalent of a family's buying a new car while ignoring the big crack in the basement. Even Republican supporters of the full tax cut, like Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, acknowledged that a huge bill was still in the mail.
"I don't know if the supplemental we got from the administration is really going to accomplish what needs to be done in Iraq," Mr. Lugar said of the president's request. "I know for sure that it doesn't touch the reconstruction."
Some Republicans grumbled that Democrats had exploited the war, using it as an excuse to do something they had pushed for earlier. 
"It just goes against common sense," said Senator Lincoln Chafee, Republican of Rhode Island, who supported Mr. Breaux's amendment and whose opposition to the tax cut had been clear for weeks. "A budget is supposed to be the blueprint for the year, but we already know we're going to get all these enormous additions from the administration. I wish we had a more solid view of where we're going to be financially."
The war's effect on the budget process began to emerge last week, when the Senate narrowly approved a measure to cut $100 billion from the tax cut and place it in a reserve fund in next year's budget to pay for the war and the costs of reconstruction. The measure failed when Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, first offered it in the budget committee, but it gained a majority in the full Senate after the war began.
"People were starting to get sensitive about the budget not being honest about the war," Mr. Feingold said today. "And Republicans were under a lot of pressure to acknowledge that the tax cut runs at cross-purposes with fighting this war. At every step of the fighting, it became more painfully obvious."
Republicans are hoping that at least one of their three members who voted today to reduce the president's proposed tax cut -- particularly Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine -- will change his or her vote. But Ms. Snowe seemed adamant about her vote, and issued a statement about "the dark shadows" cast over the economy and the tax cuts by global events. Democrats say they now hope that those shadows will extend over the full range of the administration's domestic agenda.

HEADLINE: ANATION AT WAR: ARAB WORLD; 
Saudis Send Proposals To End War To Both Sides

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: RIYADH, Saudi Arabia, March 25 

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia has sent the United States and Iraq proposals to end the war, the kingdom's foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, said today.
 Speaking to reporters upon his return to the Saudi capital from a fractious Arab League meeting in Cairo, Prince Saud said the kingdom had made a separate initiative to stop the fighting. 
 "We made the proposal and we are waiting for a possible response," the foreign minister said. He declined to be more specific about its contents. 
The prince again called on both the United States and Iraq to stop the war, saying that the conflict should be sent back to the United Nations. He also asked that diplomacy be given a second chance "so that we don't reach the point of the First World War, where people are digging trenches and dying in a war that will bring nothing but hatred between our two peoples."
Last week, the prince suggested that Saddam Hussein consider leaving Iraq, adding that Saudi Arabia would give the Iraqi leader and his family safe passage to a third country. Bahrain had earlier offered Mr. Hussein asylum. Few people expect Mr. Hussein to accept such an option, however, because it would leave him exposed to possible prosecution for war crimes.
Saudi Arabia is negotiating a narrow and difficult path between its stated opposition to the war, which is deeply unpopular among the Saudi population, and its quiet support of the American war effort. 
The United States is running its air war from a high-tech command center on Prince Sultan Air Force Base, just 50 miles southeast of Riyadh. It is also using two other northern Saudi air force bases, though the Saudi government says that use of those bases is restricted to humanitarian relief efforts.
Long one of America's most loyal allies in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia hopes to protect its relationship with the United States while not losing its stature in the Arab world. Kuwait and Qatar, which have more openly supported the United States-led war in Iraq by allowing both land and air combat missions to be launched from their soil, have become increasingly isolated in Middle Eastern diplomacy.
Saudi Arabia also wants to avoid an influx of refugees, which could pose a burden on its already troubled economy. Prince Saud said that the kingdom had prepared aid for 24,000 families, but that it was waiting for the situation in Iraq to stabilize so that it could send the aid to people in Iraq and avoid refugees crossing the Saudi border.
The country still maintains camps housing thousands of refugees from the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
"The kingdom of Saudi Arabia is calling once again for peaceful negotiation and to put behind us the negative events and go ahead to the United Nations for a collective solution within the framework of the Security Council so we can preserve Iraq's territorial integrity and protect its people," the prince said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Dow Climbs 65 Points as Roller Coaster Ride Continues

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street moved moderately higher yesterday after President Bush predicted that United States-led forces would prevail in Iraq, prompting some investors to pick up bargains from the steep decline on Monday.
 Analysts said investors seemed to take heart from several developments, including surveys showing that consumer confidence fell less than expected and that existing-home sales were brisk, as well as reports of a civilian uprising in southern Iraq. Volume was also light, creating sharper price swings. 
 "We had a bunch of small stories that have added to the stronger-than-expected economic data, which has helped stabilize the market," said Todd Clark, head of listed equity trading at Wells Fargo Securities. 
The Dow closed up 65.55 points, or 0.8 percent, at 8,280.23, after declining 307 points Monday on disappointment about news from the war over the weekend. The loss on Monday was the largest one-day point drop since Sept. 3, 2002.
Earlier yesterday, blue-chip stocks climbed as much as 123 points before losing momentum after the Senate unexpectedly voted to cut President Bush's proposed $726 billion tax cut in half.
The broader market also finished higher. The Nasdaq composite index gained 21.23 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,391.01, after a loss of 52 points on Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 10.51 points, or 1.2 percent, to 874.74, having dropped 31 points on Monday.
The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index fell to 62.5 from a revised 64.8 in February. Still, the reading beat expectations of 62.0.
The National Association of Realtors reported that existing-home sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.84 million, a 4.3 percent decline from the record pace in January. Even with the drop, it was the fourth-best month on record.
The mixed economic news would appear ripe for speculation, but investors are preoccupied. "Clearly, Baghdad is the 800-pound gorilla in the room dominating investment decisions," said A. C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates. "At the same time, there's an undercurrent of positive economic progress and stocks have good value."
Airborne rose $1.82, to $19.87, after the DHL shipping service of Deutsche Post agreed to buy it for $1.05 billion.
UnumProvident climbed $1.58, to $9.91, after it resolved a dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission by restating three years of earnings.
JetBlue gained 66 cents, to $28.61, after Bear, Stearns began coverage at outperform.
Decliners included Union Pacific, which fell 46 cents, to $56.20, after the company said its first-quarter results would not match analysts' estimates, citing rising fuel prices.
Overseas, the Nikkei stock average in Japan finished 2.3 percent lower. In Europe, the CAC-40 in France gained 2.5 percent, the FTSE 100 in Britain rose 0.5 percent and the DAX index in Germany rose 3.4 percent.

Treasury Prices Climb
By Bloomberg News
Treasury prices rose yesterday as investors speculated that the advance of United States and British forces would slow as they approach Baghdad, prolonging the war and fueling demand for the safest assets.
The price of the 10-year note rose 6/32, to 99 13/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, fell to 3.95 percent, from 3.97 percent on Monday. The 30-year bond was unchanged at 106 24/32, with a yield of 4.93 percent.

Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
Price: 99.908
High Rate: 1.180
Coupon Yield: 1.204
Low Rate: 1.140
Median Rate: 1.165
Total applied for: $43,104,037

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE ARAB WORLD; 
Even Some of Hussein's Arab Foes Take a Certain Pride in His Fight

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, March 25 

 BODY:
Normally the appearance of Saddam Hussein on television prompts catcalls, curses and prayers for his demise from a regular gathering of about 20 Saudi businessmen and intellectuals, but Monday night was different. When he appeared, they prayed that God would preserve him for a few more weeks.
 "They want Saddam Hussein to go and they expect him to go eventually, but they want him to hold on a little longer because they want to teach the Americans a lesson," said Khalid M. Batarfi, the managing editor of the newspaper Al Madina, describing the scene in a sprawling living room in Jidda, Saudi Arabia. 
 "Arab pride is at stake here," he added, describing a sentiment sweeping the region from Algeria to Yemen. "American propaganda said it was going to be so quick and easy, meaning we Arabs are weak and unable to fight. Now it is like a Mike Tyson fight against some weak guy. They don't want the weak guy knocked out in the first 40 seconds." 
From the outset, there has been a certain ambivalence in the Arab world toward the war in Iraq, an ambivalence tipping toward outright hostility as Baghdad, the fabled capital of "The Arabian Nights," shudders under American bombing. 
The region's governments, edgy about the idea of a United States-inspired change of government in Iraq, have been trying to placate Washington and siphon the anger off their streets, although they have permitted larger demonstrations than usual. 
The Middle East's educated elite, seeking deliverance from repressive governments, hope Washington wants to create a model for the region in Iraq, but the United States lacks a credible track record. The public recognizes that leaders like Mr. Hussein abuse their people, but the suspicion that the United States is embarking on a modern crusade against Islam tends to overwhelm other considerations.
Since the creation of Israel in 1948, followed by repeated military setbacks, Arabs have felt a certain humiliation in their own neighborhood. The supposed benefits of breaking free of colonialism proved a lie -- they could choose neither their neighbors nor their own governments. Fed on rhetoric about lost Arab glory, they have long waited for some kind of savior.
The Iraqi leader sought to fill that role, gaining vast public support in 1990 by contending that the road to Jerusalem led through Kuwait. Nobody believes him any more, but the yearning remains.
This week it seemed that the Iraqi people, or whoever exactly was fighting America, might win that role. 
"If Saddam's regime is going to fall, it's better for our future, for our self-confidence and for our image that it falls fighting," said Sadik Jalal al-Azam, a Syrian author and academic. "People are not defending Saddam or his regime, but they are willing to put Saddam aside for a much greater issue."
Arab governments opposed the war in Iraq from the outset. They shared no great love for Mr. Hussein, but replacing him by force seemed a bad precedent.
"If they do not like 100 regimes around the world, are they going to change all 100?" asked Buthaina Shaaban, a spokeswoman for the Syrian Foreign Ministry, reciting a familiar argument used by opponents of the Bush administration's policy. 
That prospect is unnerving for Middle Eastern governments for a variety of reasons. In Syria, which is controlled by a rival branch of Iraq's Baath Party, overthrowing the Baathists next door comes uncomfortably close to a scary preview of what might happen there. 
"Nobody knows who will be next," said Georges Jabbour, a Syrian law professor and member of Parliament. 
Longtime rulers have begun making noises about reform.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt recently announced a series of minor changes lightening the government's repressive hand, including abolishing the special state security courts for ordinary crimes.
Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia also started publicly addressing the issue of reform, although that seems more inspired by the post-Sept. 11 discovery of widespread sympathy for Osama bin Laden rather than concern that democracy in Iraq might destabilize the kingdom. 
"Frankly, we would prefer being attacked by missiles of Jeffersonian democracy to facing Scuds and other missiles," Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said earlier this month. 
Educated elites across the region once cherished the idea that the United States would push governments in the area to become more democratic, but they gradually abandoned hope. Promises for Iraq have rekindled that hope, although the Bush administration's changing justifications for invading Iraq -- from concerns about weapons of mass destruction to the need for a new government -- have cast doubt on its sincerity. 
"The U.S. has always supported the dictators who rule our countries," said Haitham Milhem, the 72-year-old lawyer who is head of the Human Rights Association of Syria. "If they create a real democracy, then any dictatorship will fear its neighbor, but we doubt America will leave a democracy in Iraq."
Much of the doubt comes from the perceived double standard in American foreign policy in the Middle East. Washington pushed the invasion of Iraq on the grounds that Iraq was flouting United Nations resolutions to disarm, Arabs point out repeatedly, while doing nothing tangible about similar resolutions demanding Israeli withdrawal from occupied Palestinian lands.
Given the lack of openness in the Arab world, assessing the broader public mood is difficult. The closest thing to an opinion poll is gauging the random opinions of people encountered.
"I have a question about the war," a Palestinian said in Amman. "Why just Saddam, why not all of them?" He reeled off the decades in power accumulated by Yasir Arafat, King Fahd, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, Mr. Mubarak and on and on.
The surprise question hinted at support for getting rid of Mr. Hussein, but also pointed to the public debate over why the United States is singling out Iraq when the region has so many repressive governments.
Those reservations grew this week as the images of the bombs devastating Baghdad appeared on television and the civilian toll rose. It was not unusual to see Arabs both weeping and seething in front of the television news.
The Arab world started out angry that yet another Arab government was facing destruction, but it was braced for what was promised to be a short campaign. A sea change in that attitude materialized by Sunday morning, following the events at the southern Iraqi port of Umm Qasr. 
First, American officials said Umm Qasr had fallen, while resistance clearly persisted; then, a marine briefly raised an American flag over the city, long enough for it to be filmed and shown repeatedly on Iraqi television.
"That electrified Iraqi patriotism," said Walid Khadduri, an Iraqi expatriate and editor of the Middle East Economic Survey. "The mood changed. It has nothing to do with the regime."
The sentiment proved infectious across the region -- volunteers even showing up by the score at Iraqi embassies prepared to join the fight. Many Arabs cursed their own governments for doing nothing but issuing empty condemnations.
"The Iraqis are real men, and I am proud of them," said Gasser Fahmi, a 30-year-old computer engineer interviewed on a Cairo street. "At the start of the war, I was very frustrated and did not want to hear the news, but now I watch the news closely to see how many losses the Americans suffer."
The war is too young yet to see where the ripples will lead, and much hinges on its outcome. But it already seems certain that the war will prove to be a powerful watershed in the region. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 27, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about pride voiced in Arab countries at Saddam Hussein's resistance to the United States misstated the surname of the head of the Human Rights Association of Syria, who said he doubted that the Americans would leave a democracy in Iraq. He is Haitham Maleh, not Milhem.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: THE IRAQI CAPITAL; 
Baghdad Empties of People, But It Fills With Foreboding

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 25 

 BODY:
It was a grim day today in Baghdad, perhaps the grimmest yet since the war began, and with the darkening prospect of worse to come.
 Not long past noon, the Iraqi capital was nearly dark, its streets nearly deserted for miles on end. Since Saturday, the city has been shrouded by huge, roiling clouds of black smoke from oil trenches Saddam Hussein's forces have set afire around the outer districts in hopes of foiling guidance systems on American aircraft and bombs. Then, overnight, a storm blew in from the desert, said to be the worst in years, blasting everything with howling winds that bent the date palms along the Tigris River almost flat, and bringing with it a thick screen of yellowish-brown sand. 
 Away to the southwest, as close to Baghdad as 50 miles in some places, advance units of the United States' Army's Third Infantry Division were probing through the choking dust. Further back, the 101st Airborne Division was moving north on a separate track. With shortwave radios and the word-of-mouth networks that keep Iraqis informed of realities their rulers would deny them, there was a hardly a man or woman in Baghdad, or even a child over 7 or 8 for that matter, who did not know that the Americans were almost at the city's gates. 
And that knowledge, in many ways, was the hardest thing of all.
For 30 years, Mr. Hussein has worked to make himself unchallengeable in Iraq. The war with Iran, the occupation of Kuwait, United Nations economic sanctions, the squaring off against America, the relentless purges of all potential challengers and critics, the astonishing hagiography of the monuments, the statues, the biographies, the adoring songs -- all have been, as many Iraqis see it, an outgrowth of the drive of an impoverished, fatherless, barefoot boy from a village on the Tigris to become, as official Iraqi publications describe him, Saddam the Great.
But in the days since American forces crossed the border from Kuwait, and especially now that they are in the early stages of mounting a siege of Baghdad, Mr. Hussein has been confronted with the worst nightmare any absolute ruler can confront -- a physical force greater than his own.
Even Iraqi loyalists, at least at the level of common men and women, say privately that, this time, the long years may be up. But they, and other Iraqis who do not support Mr. Hussein, have found themselves in something like an accord in recent days over the nightmare than could lie ahead.
In one family today, among professional, middle-class people who have long yearned for a freer Iraq unburdened by sanctions and repression, there was one obsessive concern. It was similar to the one that mesmerized this and similar families after President Bush gave Mr. Hussein and his two sons an ultimatum last week to quit Iraq within 48 hours, or face war.
Then, it was how long Iraqis had to wait for the first American airstrikes and the ground assault from Kuwait. Today, with the invaders more than 300 miles closer to Baghdad, the question was the same: How long would America take to close its account with Mr. Hussein?
The family members, fearful of being described in any way that could make them identifiable, said that they were scared to death by the success that Iraqi irregular troops, among them the most fanatical of his zealots, have had in delaying and harassing the American troops on their drive up the Euphrates River valley.
If similar groups make a fight for Baghdad, as most Iraqis believe they will, the family said, the new freedoms they had hoped to celebrate could come at too high a price in shattered Iraqi lives.
Only a week ago, two of the three grown men in the family were eager for the United States to act against Mr. Hussein. The third, still a university student, hoped for a free Iraq, but leaned toward rejecting the Faustian deal, as he saw it, that Iraqis would be making in taking their liberty from America, with its record elsewhere in the Middle East, especially its tilting toward Israel in the conflict with the Palestinians.
But today, the three were done with their quarreling, in the face of anxieties over the civil war that could break out in Baghdad if the American siege is protracted.
Hearing from the Voice of America and the BBC's shortwave broadcasts of American generals' cautious plans for moving into Baghdad, the family members said they were worried about the possibility of violent retribution against people like themselves, people with Western educations and relatives in America, if the progress toward the American capture of Baghdad was slow.
But much more than that, they said, they feared what might befall Iraqis like themselves if, faced with continued stiff resistance by Mr. Hussein's troops, Mr. Bush did what his father did at the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, and decided that a settlement was preferable to a long and grisly campaign to topple Mr. Hussein.
"That is our nightmare," one of the men said, "and we ask, 'What will Mr. Bush do to help us then?' "
Even before the war, Iraqis had begun to borrow from an imagined future, speaking out, here and there, as though new freedoms had already arrived. After the conflict started, this continued for a few days, encouraged by the fact that Mr. Hussein had disappeared from view after the American attempt to kill him with the cruise missile attack that began the war before dawn on Thursday. But then, on Monday, he reappeared with a lengthy television speech calling for Iraqi militiamen to "cut the throats" of the Americans, and the old anxieties were back in full measure, all over town.
This, amid the gloom of the sandstorm and the clouds of thick black smoke, was another reason Baghdad's spirits were at a low ebb today.
One striking aspect of the city was how little government Iraq has left, at least in terms of ministries that can deliver the services people need. Mr. Hussein's Iraq has been the nearest thing in the Middle East to a totalitarian state, controlling every aspect of its citizens' lives through a network of overlapping security agencies for which Mr. Hussein found his template in Stalin's Russia.
Near the end, however, if this is indeed the end, the government seems to be disappearing, leaving citizens, at their hour of crisis, to fend for themselves. 
After the heavy bombing attacks of Friday night turned much of the government quarter of central Baghdad into an inferno, whole ministries were abandoned. The few that were not abandoned emptied rapidly today after a formal warning the Pentagon gave Western news organizations, saying reporters in the Iraqi capital should "not go near any military assets or buildings that are used by the Iraqi government."
Word of this quickly spread, persuading people working in the Information Ministry, among others, that staying at their posts might expose them to fresh American air attacks.
If it is a conundrum how Mr. Hussein has maintained his power in a capital where the government appears to have just about shut down, the answer lies in the pattern that American troops ran into on their drive north from Kuwait. 
Although the Iraqi leader has always had iron control of the government and the army, the heart of his power has lain outside the formal institutions of the state, and especially in the shadowy network of irregular militia units and security agencies that report to members of his family. It is those elements that have now become crucial to sustaining his power.
In the neighborhoods of Baghdad, Iraqis have been observing for weeks the dispersal of those militias with strong personal loyalties to Mr. Hussein. Heavily armed, and often traveling in white pickup trucks, those men -- from the militia formations of the ruling Baath Party, from fanatical groups of fedayeen, or martyrs for God, who wear black coveralls and black face masks, and from the private armies of tribal leaders who have sworn fealty to Mr. Hussein -- are likely to be among the last groups to desert him, Iraqis say. For similar reasons, they have been the shock troops of the Iraqi leader's resistance, so far, to the American troops advancing from the south.
Mr. Hussein, of course, remains the focal point of much of the government activity that is left. At the Information Ministry, hours after the Pentagon's warning about possible American air attacks on all government buildings, lower-level staff members were busy translating, photocopying and stapling texts of Mr. Hussein's televised address on Monday, and a message he sent today to the fedayeen. 
At nightfall, some of the government minders assigned to reporters were still in the huge building, watching Iraqi television's coverage of the war. Some seemed fearful, and one asked an American reporter if he would be safe staying in the building until the end of his shift at 10 p.m.
Outside the ministry, the deserted streets were made more eerie still, after dark, by the squat, brooding shapes of the apartment blocks built to house many government officials. They, too, appeared to be mostly empty, apparently closed up and locked by families who had fled to the suburbs, or to homes in towns and villages outside Baghdad. On a drive through the area, the only face visible for blocks on end was Mr. Hussein's, on the wall posters and billboards that are the ubiquitous adornment of Baghdad.

HEADLINE: A NATION AT WAR: OPPOSITION GROUPS; 
Fear Said to Be Keeping Iraqi Dissidents From Rebelling

BYLINE:  By MARC SANTORA 

DATELINE: KUWAIT, March 25 

 BODY:
American forces have been making a point in recent days of encouraging the citizens of Iraq to rise up and fight the government of Saddam Hussein.
 Today, there were reports that Shiite Muslim civilians in the southern city of Basra had begun to resist the Iraqi authorities. The extent of any uprising could not be verified. 
 But the uprisings were not as large as had been expected. This afternoon several members of Iraqi opposition groups met with military and administration officials to explain why the uprisings had not occurred in the south. 
The explanation was a simple one. The people in Basra "live in fear," said Sheik al-Hatami, leader of an Iraqi opposition group, who said he was in contact with people in Basra. "The moment the security apparatus of the country crumbles, the people will rise up."
Maj. Gen. Peter Wall, second in command of British troops, said Basra's civilians were out in the streets "in significant numbers" and were being "less compliant" with Mr. Hussein's government.
At the same time, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was answering questions at home on the same subject.
"I am very reluctant to run around the world encouraging people to rise up," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "People will rise up. But let there be no doubt: these are a repressed people. And -- but I hope and pray they'll do it at a time when there are sufficient forces nearby to be helpful to them rather than at a time where it simply costs their life and it's a wasted life."
He added, "Anyone who's engaged in an uprising has a whole lot of courage, and I sure hope they're successful."
Sheik Hatami said that in the days before the American-led attack on Iraq, Mr. Hussein established something close to martial law in Basra, trying to prevent a repeat of the uprisings that occurred in 1991.
The civilian population of Basra was given six months of food rations and put under curfew. Loyalist fedayeen soldiers were rushed from Baghdad to threaten execution of those who ignored the curfew, Sheik Hatami said.
His account was based in part on a conversation today with someone in the city. With Basra inaccessible, independent verification of his account was impossible. Sheik Hatami fled Iraq in 1970 and makes his home in Canada, but he is in Kuwait now.
Elements of the regular Iraqi Army as well as irregular forces were controlling the center of Iraq's second largest city, home to 1.5 million people, but British troops were on the outskirts, poised to begin what they described today as a new and more aggressive campaign to root out those loyal to the government.
The residents of Basra are mainly Shiites, who make up 60 percent of Iraq's population but who have been brutally repressed under Mr. Hussein's rule.
The allied forces had hoped that the Shiites would repeat the uprisings of 1991 against Mr. Hussein's Baath Party apparatus and welcome them. But that has not happened, and conditions in the city have deteriorated sharply.
The situation is complicated, said people who had been in contact with civilians in Basra, experts on the Shiite population in Iraq and accounts by reporters who recently traveled in the area.
Fear is a factor. But it is compounded by memories of President George Bush's call during the first Persian Gulf war for "the Iraqi people to take matters into their own hands and force Saddam Hussein, the dictator, to step aside."
Many Shiites in the south and Kurds in the north followed that advice, only to be brutally crushed while America failed to help them.
"They had a bad experience with the Americans, and they paid dearly for it," said Dr. Abdul-Reda A. Assiri, a Kuwait University professor.
He said people wanted to be sure the allies were going to finish the job. The initial military strategy of surrounding Basra and then hoping the Iraqis would invite them in may have contributed to the impression that the invading armies were not coming to help them.
Many young people who grew up under the economic penalties imposed on the country after the first gulf war blame America for the harsh conditions they have had to endure, Dr. Assiri said.
"You have to remember," he said. "Saddam has a very sophisticated propaganda machine."
Sheik Hatami said Mr. Hussein had long been preparing for war with America.
He said Mr. Hussein had tried to supplement his control over the military by paying local tribal leaders to fight on his behalf and by punishing dissenters.
In order to convince tribal leaders that it is acceptable to break with Mr. Hussein, Sheik Hatami said he was working with other clerics outside Iraq to issue a religious edict saying such action would be legitimate.
Even if uprisings do eventually begin, it remains to be seen how American troops will be viewed, especially if the military campaign drags on.

HEADLINE: Hopes Fading for Bolivia Pipeline Project 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: LA PAZ, Bolivia, March 21 

 BODY:
Ed Miller had high hopes in the late 1990's when, as manager for British Gas in this landlocked country, he and another geologist came up with a sure-fire plan to develop and market Bolivia's immense reserves of natural gas.
 With an eye on California and its insatiable appetite for energy, three multinationals, including British Gas, soon formed a consortium to build a 400-mile pipeline to the Pacific coast. The idea was to liquefy the gas and ship it to California, with projected sales of $21 billion over 20 years. 
 But with $350 million already invested, the project that was once heralded as Latin America's largest infrastructure development is now close to collapse, a casualty of roiling nationalism and political turbulence in Bolivia. 
"The project is coming to the end of its opportunity window," said Mr. Miller, 47, an American who recently left the consortium and now runs a pipeline that transports gas to Brazil. "I would say the window was wide open a year ago, and now it's almost shut."
Indeed, the government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, buffeted by antigovernment protests that killed 30 people in February, has delayed plans to announce a decision on the project's next phase: whether to build a pipeline through Peru or through Bolivia's old enemy, Chile. Instead, the government is now talking about consulting with Bolivians, to let them to make the decision. But the companies of the Pacific LNG project, as the consortium is called -- Repsol-YPF of Spain; British Gas; and Pan American Energy, a BP subsidiary -- insist that Chile is the only viable option, because building through Peru would cost $600 million more. An American consulting firm working for the Bolivian government recently reached the same conclusion.
Aides to Mr. Sanchez de Lozada said the government was still carefully studying both options.
But people close to the project said the president was actually paralyzed, because deciding on Chile would lead to huge, destabilizing protests.
"The government does not have the political oxygen to decide," said Gonzalo Chavez, an economic analyst and former vice minister of energy.
Opposition to the project is intense and spreading, fueled by left-leaning indigenous leaders who strongly reject the Chilean option. Most Bolivians have never forgiven Chile for snatching Bolivia's coastal province in a 19th-century war, including the region around the present-day port of Patillos, where a liquefaction plant would be built.
The opposition also includes senior military officers who pronounced themselves against the project for reasons of "national dignity." Even the president's partner in the government coalition, former President Jaime Paz Zamora, has questioned the sale of natural gas, saying, "Bolivia must come first."
In one of Latin America's most nationalistic countries, some critics also oppose the very idea of selling gas to the United States, which is viewed as an imperialist aggressor.
"The gas stays here," explained Choque Huanca, a newly elected member of Congress, who represents a left-leaning indigenous political party. "We can consume it here."
Such talk, though, ignores the fact that Bolivia, with a gross domestic product of just $8 billion, could make use of only a tiny fraction of its gas reserves -- now estimated at 52 trillion cubic feet, second in Latin America only to Venezuela's. Even supplying California for 20 years would consume only 13 percent of the gas.
Economic analysts say this desperately poor country could vastly improve its economic outlook by positioning itself as an important gas supplier to California before other countries do. Taxes and royalties on exported gas could bring in up to $7.7 billion in a generation.
But to become a great gas power, Bolivia needs foreign capital to finance the Pacific LNG project, whose total cost is estimated at $5 billion or more.
Changing minds in Bolivia will not be easy. Companies of all kinds have faced stiffening opposition to their investment plans as Bolivians have turned against the market reform model once championed by the president.
"There is a repudiation," said Jose Guillermo Justiniano, minister of the presidency, the executive's administrative arm. "That is why there is a conviction against the model. They see the model as the devil. Market economies are the devil."
The government of Mr. Sanchez de Lozada has been so battered by opponents that it lacks the political capital to undertake austerity measures or make unpopular economic decisions. In an interview, the president acknowledged the influence of his opponents.
"If I announced the second coming of Christ, they would vote against it," he said.
Bolivia's future, though, will remain grim unless it is open to foreign investment, political analysts say.
"The fact of the matter is, you cannot go back on globalization, and no country can afford to isolate itself from the international currents," said Eduardo Gamarra, a Bolivian-born expert on the country at Florida International University in Miami.
Mr. Miller, a Californian who first came to Bolivia in 1978, ran an Argentine company that in the late 1990's was among the first to find major gas deposits. After mapping out the pipeline plan on a barroom napkin, he assumed Bolivians would welcome a project that promised to inject billions of dollars into a moribund economy.
But now, the dream is all but dead -- prompting him to abandon Pacific LNG. "I essentially became frustrated and burned out," he said.

HEADLINE: With Wires in the Walls, The Cyberhome Hums 

BYLINE:  By LISA GUERNSEY 

 BODY:
WHEN my husband, Rob Krupicka, and I built a house last year, we dreamed of modern conveniences minus modern-day headaches. We wanted music everywhere, Internet access that extended to the front porch and news at the touch of a button. We didn't want to face another nest of tangled cables or to see speaker wires snaking beneath the rugs. We wanted to watch a DVD without having to remember that the white remote is for surround sound, the long remote goes on before the short one and the one with the yellow buttons might be on the blink.
 Some of our dreams were based on new realities. In our home near Washington, where we are busy raising a toddler, anxiety is a given: the threat of terrorism feels close. Keeping up with the world's news can be stressful enough without having to fight with technology, too. 
 Other families have their own ways of coping -- they want to be assured, at least, that their houses are impregnable. It's not that families imagine terrorists lurking by the mailbox. "People just want to feel safe in their homes," said Rocco Rutigliano, general manager of All Time Detection, a security company in Port Chester, N.Y., whose sales of security systems have jumped 50 percent since 9/11. 
Sixty-two percent of builders in a recent survey said they offer security systems in new homes. And some home buyers want elaborate features like video monitoring in rooms with windows and doors. David C. Hughes, an architect in Columbus, Ohio, said parents want to make sure the house is protected "when the children are home after school and they aren't there."
Security concerns aside, Mr. Hughes said, "people are insisting that their houses be wired for the future."
Mike Stathakis of Lake Barrington, Ill., paid about $8,000 for a lighting and security network in his 5,500-square-foot house. It turns on lights automatically when he comes in from the garage, and they stay on long enough for him to carry in the groceries. A "good night" button turns on the alarm system and sets the hallway lights to activate when motion is detected near the rooms of his three children.
The 1990's catch phrase was "smart home," for houses with Internet-linked appliances that could, for example, tell when you ran out of milk and automatically order more, or chill the wine while you were still on the expressway. It never quite happened that way, though some early adopters have had fun testing the latest electronic gizmos. John Geiwitz, president and founder of Smart Systems Technologies, which sells home systems, says his house in Albuquerque recognizes his car, then opens the garage door, disarms the security alarm and turns on lights. The system, which cost about $9,000, also lets him go online at work to adjust the temperature in the living room.
But successful smart houses are not very common, said Ray Lepper, the president of Home Media Richmond in Virginia and the vice president of the Custom Electronic Design and Installation Association, a trade group known as Cedia. "Most of them were really dumb homes," he said, "and you had to turn them off with an ax." Wired to continually adjust the heat, for example, a smart house might overlook the option of opening a window.
What Rob and I wanted was much simpler, a so-called networked home with "digital plumbing" for Internet and television connections hidden behind walls, and just enough equipment to make tapping into video and audio as easy as filling a glass of water. We wanted rooms that would showcase our furnishings, not our growing stockpile of electronic equipment, which would be tucked in a utility closet in our home office.
Along with the closet, we got wireless Internet access inside and on the porch, and speakers in most of the ceilings. We were tired of fighting with manuals and numbered keypads, so we had icon-driven touch screens installed on a few walls. Eager to rid ourselves forever of multiple remote controls, we bought a portable touch pad for the television room that does the job of six.
The backbone of any networked home is "structured wiring," a bundle of high-speed cables put in the walls before the drywall goes on. More builders are including such cables automatically, and roughly a million homes have them, according to Parks Associates, a research company in Dallas specializing in home networking. "Two years ago, we would have to fight with a builder to put structured wiring in a home," said Jeff Hoover, president of Cedia. "Now it is a given."
Pulte Homes, one of the largest builders in the country, considers structured wiring a standard feature, said Valerie Dolenga, a spokeswoman, and has put it in about 60 percent of the houses built in the last year.
Real estate agents say the investment can help when it comes time to sell. "In new homes, you just have to have it," said Nancy Dunning, a broker at McEnearney Associates in Alexandria, Va. "And in resales, it's a big plus."
Mr. Hughes, who is designing a 15,000-square-foot house with built-in wiring and speakers, noted that the shift toward networking allows design flexibility. Hiding cables and equipment, he said, "gives us much greater freedom as to where we can put TV screens, how furniture can be laid out and how the room is going to function."
There are trade-offs. Sam Mitchell, an architect in New Haven, said the challenge is in getting clients to make sensible predictions of how they intend to use their preinstalled systems, lest every wall be dotted with speaker knobs.
Structured wiring is the requisite ingredient in any system, and when incorporated during construction it can cost $1 a square foot of living space. But acquiring all the fancy faucets for that digital plumbing can cost $50,000 or more.
In existing homes, installation is complicated by the necessity of opening up walls. Jeffery McGlothlin, a real estate broker in Alexandria, Va., said he sold an $825,000 house to a couple who spent several hundred thousand dollars on renovations and $80,000 more for wiring and all the latest equipment. They now have video screens in most rooms and a tiny camera over the crib in the baby's room. If the baby cries, the music in the networked audio system fades and the video screen tunes in.
But installing a network in an existing home need not require the equivalent of open-heart surgery. Home Media Richmond, for example, performs "wall-oscopies," Mr. Lepper said, cutting a slit and a few small holes and fishing the wire through. A wireless Internet router, which can cost less than $100, is a good option for high-speed access for computers in several rooms.
Despite the high cost of a full-blown system, professional installers say they are getting more calls, even as the economy continues to sour. The installer we hired, Integrated Media Systems in Sterling, Va., has grown from a two-person shop in 1979 to a company of 30.
Integrated Media told us our project was typical these days for custom-designed houses. In addition to hidden speakers and wiring, we have a 300-CD changer, an AM/FM tuner, a DVD player, surround sound, high-definition television and a security system that alerts the authorities if break-ins are detected. We saw no need for video cameras, but my husband did want to tap into his playlists of MP3 files without having to turn on a computer. That required a music server, a black box with a CD burner, which is stowed in the closet and can hold and distribute digital music to the speakers throughout the house. A system like ours can cost from $1,500 at the low end to tens of thousands for a multizone installation.
Networked houses are not without bugs. True simplicity means getting all the devices to speak the same language, so they work together without their owners having to remember codes, plug in wires or press a series of buttons. We discovered belatedly that our MP3 player will not communicate with a touch screen made by another company. (Our installer volunteered to replace the server with a compatible device.)
Mr. Stathakis, the homeowner in Lake Barrington, Ill., had his installer, Habiquest, of Rolling Meadows, Ill., put in a Smart Systems Technologies touch panel driven entirely by icons (a padlock for security, for instance). "I haven't even picked up the owner's manual yet," he said. But he couldn't eliminate the remote that controls the audio and video system, which has speakers in several rooms.
Along with the glitch in our MP3 files, we are adjusting to the fact that even with wireless Internet access, we need to plug our phones, laptop and printer into wall outlets, so not every single wire is out of sight. And who knows whether, in 10 years, the currently lightning-fast cabling in our walls will seem hopelessly sluggish. (Let's hope wall-oscopies will be even more advanced by then.)
When we looked hard at the costs, we decided against a central lighting system, to let us turn off the living room lights from the comfort of bed. I was already having a heart attack over the price of the audio and video system. So we put light switches in every room. In the end, we decided, two grown adults are capable of walking to them, one by one. Besides, we need the exercise.

Can't Go Behind the Drywall? Go Wireless
 SOME alternatives for those who cannot open up walls or build from scratch:
LIGHTING -- Remotes can be used to control free-standing lamps. Options include so-called X10 systems, which send signals over existing power lines to a number of lights; $50 and up from electronics stores or at Web sites like www.smarthome.com.
WEB LINKS -- A wireless Internet link lets you surf from almost anywhere. Connections are usually good up to 300 feet indoors. Expect to spend about $100 for a router; each computer will also require a $70 wireless adapter. 
Internet access can also be distributed over existing electrical wiring. Called power line networking, it can cost less than $100 for each computer. Computer stores carry adapters and routers for both power line networking and wireless Internet links.
MUSIC SERVER -- A wireless MP3 player, while lacking the fidelity of a wired system, beams MP3 files to a stereo; $249 at www.cd3o.com.
SIMPLIFYING REMOTES -- Universal remote controls can replace the half-dozen remotes that operate your television, DVD player, cable box, stereo and VCR. Models under $300 are available at electronics stores, although they still have lots of buttons.
Sophisticated touch-screen panels can also do away with most remote controls. They should be ordered from a professional installer and alsoprogrammed by a professional. Expect to spend at least $3,000. LISA GUERNSEY

How to Get The Gear
NETWORKED homes are becoming more common, but before spinning fantasies about what you would like to have, consider these tips from those who have already plunged in.
For serious tinkerers, www.hometoys.com may be helpful. All others should hire a professional installer or integrator. To search for one by ZIP code: www.cedia.com or www.electronichouse.com.
Choose touch panels with icons, to eliminate codes and manuals.
Ask the installer about repair and service. Some provide a year of free service. Beyond that, service packages can be purchased. Upgrading equipment often requires having the installer return to reprogram the system, for a fee. LISA GUERNSEY

CONCERT TOURS CANCELED OVER WARTIME FEARS -- The number of musicians and groups canceling concerts and tours over wartime safety concerns is growing. Last week Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu, the husband-and-wife opera stars, quit as the leads in "Faust" at the Met and returned home to France. This week two major European classical groups and a noted Gypsy singer canceled their American tours. The Rotterdam Philharmonic was to begin a seven-city sweep on Sunday with the conductor Valery Gergiev, above, but announced on Tuesday that it would not make the journey. The managing director of the orchestra, Rob Overman, said that the decision was made because of "the increasing feeling of insecurity as a result of the actual war situation." But Mr. Gergiev, not a man to be kept down, will complete the tour with the Kirov Orchestra. Mr. Gergiev, who is the music director of both orchestras, said in a statement, "My Kirov colleagues and I feel that the role of music in turbulent times is immeasurably important, providing people a way to share feelings, look deep within themselves and voice their joys and passions." (The Kirov will replace Rotterdam at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday.) Wartime travel safety concerns were also cited by Hesperion XXI, an acclaimed early-music group from Spain, and the Gypsy singer Esma Redzepova. Hesperion will cut short its tour and return home on Sunday; Ms. Redzepova was to appear in a World Music Institute concert in May.

CELEBRATING SMALL PUBLISHERS -- The 15th annual Small Press Book Fair will take place on Saturday and Sunday with readings, panels and other events for representatives of some 200 small publishers from across the country. To kick off the event, George Plimpton, left, the founder of The Paris Review, will receive the center's Poor Richard's Award at a private ceremony tomorrow, for his contribution to publishing. Among the writers first published in The Paris Review were Jack Kerouac and Philip Roth. The weekend events, which are free, will be at the Small Press Center, 20 West 44th Street in Manhattan. Information: (212) 764-7021, or www.smallpress.org.

SCULPTOR TO COMPLETE WORK ON SAGRADA FAMILIA -- Since 1986 the sculptor Josep Maria Subirachs, has been working to complete one of the three facades of Gaudi's famously unfinished Sagrada Familia church in Barcelona. Agence France-Presse reports that Mr. Subirachs has said he will complete his work -- the stark Passion Facade, on the opposite side from Gaudi's joyful Nativity side -- within two years. The completion of the church has been a controversial issue in Barcelona, where residents are proud and protective of their city's architectural heritage. Mr. Subirachs, 76, has been completing his work in his own style, though construction teams work daily to finish the church according to plans made by Gaudi, who was killed in a streetcar accident in 1926.

PRE-EMPTIVE BUDGET CUTS AT BOSTON OPERA -- The director of the Boston Lyric Opera, Janice Mancini Del Sesto, says the company's finances are in order. But when the opera's 2003-4 season was announced last week, there was a 25 percent reduction in its repertory -- they went from their usual four opera productions to three. "We're taking a pre-emptive measure to stay in good financial shape," she said yesterday. "What's happened in this uncertain political and economic climate is that donors are concerned about making multiyear pledges, and at the same level they did in the past. So the growth of gifts has leveled off." The company's annual operating budget is $7.5 million, about 70 percent of which comes from private donations. A spokeswoman for the opera said the reduction in repertory was expected to reduce the budget by $1 million.

ROCKER, POET, ARTIST -- Patti Smith, right, is as widely known for her poetry as for her music, but her talents do not stop there. Tomorrow the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston will open an exhibition of her drawings over the last 30 years. "Strange Messenger: The Work of Patti Smith" has more than 80 works on paper, including a series of large-scale drawings of the World Trade Center in varying stages of destruction. The show, organized and first seen at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, runs through June 15. Also tomorrow, Ms. Smith inaugurates the show with a performance at 8 p.m. by her band at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts in downtown Houston. Information for the performance: (713) 315-2525. For the exhibition: (713) 284-8265, or www .camh.org.

FOOTNOTES

The German baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau has canceled a workshop and performance at Carnegie Hall because of illness. Mr. Fischer-Dieskau, 77, was to lead a training workshop during the week of April 8, and speak in a Carnegie Talks program on April 12. . . . The winner of the fifth annual Koret Young Writer on Jewish Themes Award is Mark Oppenheimer, an essayist and scholar of American religion whose book "Knocking on Heaven's Door: Religion in the Age of Counterculture" is being published by Yale University Press. The award, to be given April 7, includes a $25,000 fellowship and three months in residence at Stanford University. . . . Publisher's Weekly this week announced its lists of the top-selling children's books of 2002, and there are other winners besides Harry Potter. The most popular hardcover is "The Carnivorous Carnival," the latest in Lemony Snicket's "Series of Unfortunate Events" books, which sold more than 726,000 copies. A Potter book was not published last year, but the most recent, "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," sold more than 2.8 million copies in paperback.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 28, 2003

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Arts Briefing column yesterday about top-selling children's books of 2002 misidentified the Harry Potter book that led the paperback category. It was "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (the most recent in the series) not "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" (the second).

HEADLINE: Europe Moves to Require Quarterly Financial Reports 

BYLINE:  By PAUL MELLER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, March 26 

 BODY:
The European Union's executive body proposed today that the 7,000 companies with shares trading on the union's stock exchanges be required to publish quarterly financial reports. 
 But the reports would not need to be audited and would not have to be very detailed. 
 The proposed law, derided by some bankers and stock exchange executives as "quarterly reporting lite," would increase the amount of information that companies would have to include in the half-year reports they now release -- but those, too, would not have to be audited. 
"This proposal aims to ensure that investment decisions are based on sound information about issuers of securities -- information available to all investors, large and small, experts and nonexperts," said the union's internal-market commissioner, Frits Bolkestein.
But the European Commission, the union's executive body, wanted to minimize the burden on companies, he said. "Compared to current practice in the U.S.," Mr. Bolkestein said, "we have opted for less-demanding publication periods and a more pragmatic mix of more detailed half-yearly financial reports and light, but reliable, quarterly financial information."
Under current law, bond issuers must publish reports annually; stock issuers must do so twice a year. Many member countries already require quarterly reports, but not Britain, the union's biggest financial center.
The London Stock Exchange, with 2,800 companies listed, has lobbied against mandatory quarterly reports, saying that its present half-year system and a general requirement that sensitive information be promptly disclosed is sufficient to protect investors. But the exchange withdrew its objections when the commission dropped a demand that the quarterly results be audited.
"We welcome the concessions that have been made for quarterly reporting," a spokesman for the London exchange, Ian Campbell, said. 
But he said the commission had missed an opportunity by failing to adopt the exchange's rule about rapid public disclosure of market-sensitive information.
"This is the model that Europe should aspire to," Mr. Campbell said.
The proposal calls on national financial authorities to allow companies to announce results on a Web site. It makes reference to some form of alert system that would inform the public about important announcements, but it said this would be dealt with in future rules.
Under the proposed code, six-month financial reports would need to conform to international accounting standards. They need not be audited, but a company's directors would have to vouch for their accuracy.
Member countries would also be required to ensure that companies were held liable for the half-year figures, according to the European Commission.
The commission's proposed law is part of an effort to integrate the union's market for financial services by 2005, but Mr. Bolkestein said it is not an attempt to standardize rules across the 15-member union. The proposal must be adopted by national governments and by the European Parliament before it becomes law.
It has several provisions meant to benefit stockholders, like allowing them to vote on shareholder issues online. Members of the Parliament are expected to call for more rights and protections for investors.
Mr. Bolkestein acknowledged that tougher rules might be required. "This is the minimum modern capital markets need to attract more investment from more people," he said.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
Today, policy makersview war as a generator of expenses rather than an economic stimulus.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the author of "The Future and Its Enemies." Her book on the increasing economic and cultural importance of aesthetics will be published in September by HarperCollins. E-mail: vpostrel@dynamist.com.

 BODY:
ENDING months of debate and speculation, the Bush administration this week asked Congress for nearly $75 billion to cover the costs of the Iraq war through the end of September.
 Coming amid an economic slowdown, the request raises a question: Why don't we hear more about how this spending mighthelp the economy? 
 After all, just a generation ago, critics of military spending not only had to argue that it was unnecessary for national security, they also had to counter the widespread belief that cutbacks would wreck the economy.
"War brings prosperity. This was the conclusion drawn by Americans who watched the war economy of World War II bring an end to the Great Depression," the antiwar intellectual Seymour Melman wrote in "The Permanent War Economy," published in 1974. The book sought to reverse that perception. 
Few if any macroeconomic scholars would have endorsed the simple notion that "war brings prosperity." But two influences led that idea to percolate into public consciousness: the prominence of Keynesian theory and the experience of wartime production.
Keynesians held that the Depression had persisted because New Deal spending had not been big enough to restart the economy. The war forced the government to abandon fears of large-scale spending.
The war pumped up demand for unemployed workers and underused factories. Indeed, the Depression "made World War II possible," the macroeconomist Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University argued in an interview. "We had vast wasted resources -- unutilized factories, unemployed workers."
"Our capacity to build automobiles was only being used at one-half," he added, so it was relatively easy to ramp up production of military equipment like tanks and ships.
The wartime demand for military production was so obvious that after the war many people feared the economy would slip quickly back into recession. Where, if not from government, would the demand come from?
Postwar demand came, of course, from consumers and their rapidly multiplying children, the baby boomers.
But the cold war also kept military spending high by historic (though not World War II) standards. And the Depression left scars on the public psyche, producing the fear that without continuous large government outlays, the private economy would falter.
Mainstream Keynesian theory held that government spending was needed to bolster the economy during recessions. Few macroeconomists argued that government should keep spending large sums even when the private economy was expanding.
But that idea did have influential backing, particularly from Alvin Hansen of Harvard, the dean of prewar Keynesians. He promoted the idea of "secular stagnation," which held that inefficiencies in the economy were constantly threatening recession, even during booms, unless the government kept spending high.
"Hansen, unlike the standard Keynesians, argued that you not only needed countercyclical management, you needed full-time pump priming," said John Nye, an economic historian at Washington University in St. Louis.
Most macroeconomic scholars were more judicious, but Mr. Hansen's ideas were popular. Professor Nye noted that "many of his ideas got swallowed up" into the popular wisdom that the economy needs constant stimulus and, hence, that high military spending is good for the economy.
From the stagflation of the 1970's to the prosperity of the 1990's, experience has mostly reversed these popular perceptions. The 1990's boom demonstrated that a strong economy can persist not only amid budget surpluses but also after substantial post-cold-war military cuts.
As for the war in Iraq, it is tiny compared with previous wars.
"The order of magnitude compared to the size of the economy is far less," Professor Gordon said. A short war "fought out of inventory," he said, would not have much immediate effect on the economy, at least as far as spending is concerned.
The "expenditures to prosecute the war are relatively small," concurred Laurence Meyer, a former Federal Reserve governor now at the Center for Strategic and International Affairs.
So today, supporters and opponents of the Iraq war argue over its military and diplomatic merits, not its economic effects. Economic evaluations, for their part, emphasize the negative effects of uncertainty and possible oil shocks, rather than any positive effects of military spending.
"Most people who believe that this war will be good for the economy see it in a different way -- as a way of quickly getting rid of geopolitical uncertainty," Dr. Meyer said.
Today, policy makers see war not as an economic stimulus but as a generator of expenses that have to be covered one way or the other, with negative effects on both the government budget and the private economy.
The budget question is whether the security benefits of war justify the costs or, perhaps, whether alternative strategies would cost more.
Three economists at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business recently compared the costs of the Iraq war with the costs of an alternative strategy of containment. (Their paper is available at http://gsbwww .uchicago.edu/fac/steven.davis/research.) They wrote the essay "to clarify our thinking about the war and to address some views that are widely held but not carefully scrutinized," said Steven J. Davis, who worked with Kevin M. Murphy and Robert H. Topel on the estimates.
They use a generous estimate of $125 billion for the direct costs of the war and peg the cost of containment at $13 billion a year for troops and equipment.
Assuming a 3 percent chance that the Iraqi regime "morphs from malign to benign in any given year," an estimate based on the persistence of other "contained" repressive regimes, containment would last 33 years, they estimated. "The most apt comparison is probably to North Korea," Professor Davis said, noting that the regime continued "in essentially the same form" even after Kim Il Sung died in 1994.
"This dwarfs any reasonable estimate of U.S. war costs," they concluded.

Shares Drop on Concerns War Will Be Protracted

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday amid growing skepticism that the war in Iraq, a drag on spending by consumers and businesses, would end anytime soon.
 Medical equipment makers declined after a UBS Warburg analyst removed his buy rating on Medtronic and Guidant. Power suppliers like Mirant and Dynegy dropped as federal regulators increased the refunds they say the companies owe California for overcharging during the state's energy crisis. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 4.79 points, or 0.6 percent, to 869.95. 
Health care and utilities shares contributed more than a third of the loss. The Dow Jones industrial average sank 50.35 points, or 0.6 percent, to 8,229.88. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.56 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,387.45.
Four stocks fell for every three that rose on the New York Stock Exchange, while six declined for every five that advanced on the Nasdaq. More than 1.29 billion shares traded on the Big Board, 4.8 percent below the three-month daily average.
A poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 38 percent of those surveyed March 24 thought that the war was going well, down from 71 percent on Friday. The poll of 1,495 adults had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
Medtronic, the world's largest supplier of pacemakers, declined $1.20, to $45.90, and Guidant, the biggest maker of stents to prop open arteries, shed $2.02, to $35.80. A UBS Warburg analyst, David Lothson, cut his recommendation on both to neutral from buy.
Boston Scientific., the world's No. 2 maker of stents that help prop open arteries, dropped $2.70, to $43.25.
Power companies dipped after regulators raised their refund to California to $3.3 billion from $1.8 billion.
Mirant dipped 25 cents, to $1.56, while Dynegy slid 19 cents, to $2.33. Reliant Resources fell 95 cents, to $3.05, and El Paso dropped 25 cents, to $5.73.
Industrial stocks, including Honeywell International and 3M fell after a Commerce Department report showed that orders for durable goods fell in February for the third month in four. Honeywell slid 17 cents, to $22.31, while 3M dropped 57 cents, to $131.73.
Orders for items made to last at least three years declined 1.2 percent. "It tells us that investment spending remains flat, and it won't pick up anytime soon," said Elisabeth Denison, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.
Sears, Roebuck was among the gainers. It surged $2.69, or 13 percent, to $24.14, after the company said that it might sell its credit card business. The value of the credit business is not reflected in the company's share price, Sears said.

HEADLINE: Machinists' Union Sues United Over Layoffs 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
The machinists' union filed suit yesterday against United Airlines to block the layoffs of 1,148 mechanics at the Indianapolis maintenance base, contending that United had used the war in Iraq as an excuse for cutting its operations.
 United maintains that the layoffs are legal under its union contracts, which allow employees to be furloughed without pay in the case of an emergency, like a war. The airline did not comment on the suit. 
 A hearing on the suit was scheduled for April 9 in United States District Court in Indianapolis. United notified the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers last week that it planned to place the workers on "authorized no-pay status." They would receive benefits and keep their seniority but not receive pay.
United filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December. It laid off the first 458 mechanics in Indianapolis on Tuesday, with the remaining layoffs scheduled for April 15. The first group would return to work in June, while the others are not scheduled to return until August.
The action came as United and five of its labor unions are engaged in talks on $2.56 billion in concessions that the airline says are necessary for it to keep flying. It has asked a federal bankruptcy court for permission to set aside its labor contracts and impose the cuts, if it cannot reach agreement with its unions. A hearing on that motion is set for April 14 in Chicago.
"United's action is especially outrageous, considering we are in a critical stage of negotiations," said Scotty Ford, president of District 141-M of the machinists' union, which represents the mechanics.
It was the first such suit resulting from an airline's actions in the wake of the war. Over the last week, domestic airlines have announced more than 10,000 layoffs and cut their schedules by about 10 percent. The Air Transport Association, the trade group for the airlines, said yesterday that it expected domestic travel to decline 20 percent and international travel to drop 40 percent in the near future, given the recent rate of bookings.
Frederic Brace III, United's chief financial officer, said yesterday that the war would pose "severe challenges" for income and cash flow industrywide. 
Still, some analysts say the industry's cutbacks are related more to the weak economy than the war.
The suit came as United said it had easily met the first set of requirements under $1.5 billion in debtor-in-possession financing that it obtained when it filed for bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Home Sales And Orders To Factories ShowDeclines 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 26 

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family homes plunged to the lowest level in nearly three years in February, while manufacturing demand weakened, according to two reports released by the Commerce Department today.
 "The reports suggest that February was a very weak month for the general economy," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Banc of America Capital Management. "We saw the negative effects of bad weather, worries about an impending war with Iraq, an increase in oil prices and a decline in the stock market." 
 New-home sales plummeted 8.1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 854,000, the lowest level since August 2000. That came on top of an even steeper 12.6 percent decline in January.
There was a 36.8 percent drop in the Northeast, which was hard hit by snowstorms during the month. That pushed sales in the region down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 48,000, the lowest since January 1996.
Sales in the South fell 8.6 percent, to a rate of 395,000, and in the Midwest they went down 6.3 percent, to a pace of 149,000. In the West, sales were flat -- at a rate of 262,000.
"The weather is a problem and so is the weight of uncertainty on consumer behavior," said David Seiders, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders. "I'm assuming both are quite temporary."
In the manufacturing report, orders to factories for big-ticket goods fell 1.2 percent in February, unwinding part of the 1.9 percent gain reported in January.
Private economists had predicted orders for durable goods -- products expected to last at least three years -- would fall as companies put off buying new equipment with war imminent.
The weakness in orders to factories was broad based, with losses reported for computers, cars and metals.
"There does not seem to be enough traction in theeconomy for the manufacturing segment to sustain forward momentum," said Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist at the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a research group.
The manufacturing sector, hardest hit by the 2001 recession, has been the biggest drag on the economy's ability to return to full throttle.
In the durable-goods report, orders for automobiles fell 1.5 percent in February after a 9.9 percent advance in January.
Excluding orders for transportation equipment, durable goods orders declined 2.1 percent in February, the largest drop in eight months.
Orders for computers plunged 12.3 percent after a 1.2 percent rise in January. For primary metals, the category including steel, orders fell 2.3 percent after January's 2.8 percent increase.
Shipments, a good barometer of current demand, decreased 1.6 percent in February after a 2.7 percent gain in January.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
With the war compartmentalized on TV, advertising has remained surprisingly constant.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH the war in Iraq has not had the drastic impact on advertising spending that was feared before the fighting began, analysts on Madison Avenue and Wall Street are still worried about just how damaging the effects could yet be.
 The news media have mostly refrained from continuous war coverage, which has allowed near-normal amounts of ads to appear. But some marketers have still decided to delay or even cancel campaigns, reducing revenue -- at least in the short term -- for agency and media companies. 
 Estimates of how much commercial time and ad space have been lost in the last seven days range from less than $100 million to $250 million, compared with prewar predictions that were two or three times that. 
But if the war drags on or terrorists strike the United States, those dollars could remain unspent, and additional spending could be threatened.
"To the degree it is a short war, the money could come flying back, re-expressed in the second or third quarter," said Lauren Rich Fine, the analyst who follows the ad industry for Merrill Lynch.
"But that could change if the war changes and there's wall-to-wall coverage" again, she added, referring to reporting that runs ad-free. Dan Rather on the "CBS Evening News" on Monday pithily described the current method as, "When news breaks out, we'll break in."
Because the disruptions in the media plans of advertisers have been fewer than expected, Ms. Fine said, she is putting off any revision of her most recent forecasts for 2003, which were made last month. Ms. Fine's prediction is for ad spending in the United States to increase 3.7 percent this year from weak 2002 results, and increase 2.7 percent worldwide.
Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group, owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, said, "I've got scenarios all over the place, six one way, six the other."
"At the present time, I don't have any good, strong reasons for changing my current forecast one way or the other," said Mr. Coen, who is considered the dean of predictors because he has been tracking ad spending for more than five decades. "I would hold for another couple of weeks before reassessing."
Mr. Coen predicted in December that United States ad spending in 2003 would increase just 2.6 percent from 2002, when it fell 6.5 percent. 
The two biggest national advertisers, the General Motors Corporation and the Procter & Gamble Company, said they were advertising at close to regular levels.
"We're not running ads in anything devoted 100 percent to war coverage," said Peg Holmes, a spokeswoman for G.M. in Detroit, "but we're keeping our normal presence in sports, entertainment and general news, which may include some war news."
Among the brands General Motors has continued to promote in the last week are Cadillac, on the Academy Awards; Chevrolet and Pontiac, on coverage of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament; and Hummer.
Gretchen Mutchnick, a spokeswoman for Procter in Cincinnati, said, "we're getting back to normal" after a 48-hour advertising hiatus that began last Wednesday. Procter's media buys are proceeding as planned, she said, except for commercials during war coverage on radio and television.
Those attitudes are typical of major marketers, said Gary Fries, president and chief executive at the Radio Advertising Bureau in New York.
"The mood, particularly in local markets, is not on a war plane," he added. "Car dealers are advertising, and people are shopping. People are eating out, and restaurants are advertising."
Mr. Fries said that ad spending in radio would suffer a slight decline this month, but less because of the war than because of the timing of Easter, which stimulates advertising. Last year it fell in March, but this year it is in April.
Chris Rohrs, president of the Television Bureau of Advertising in New York, the trade organization for local TV stations, said he also noticed a slowdown in ad spending this month -- not so much from the war but "because of the buildup to war, which slowed things for about two weeks."
"Yes, we had cancellations and people pulling spots, but fewer than the gulf war in 1991, or 9/11," Mr. Rohrs said. "Some pulled out only from news programming, some withdrew only for 24 to 48 hours and some did not withdraw at all."
"Advertisers realize viewers welcome advertising as a reassurance of normalcy," he added, "which contributed to keeping commercials in the mix instead of going 'wall to wall.' "
Members of the television bureau "feel most of the dollars that were moved or pulled are going to be recoverable," Mr. Rohrs said. "But I'd use a 'but' with a capital 'B,' " he added, "because it depends on events" in Iraq.
Gene DeWitt, president of another TV organization in New York, the Syndicated Network Television Association, which represents companies like Disney and Viacom that sell shows to local stations, said: "The odds are pretty good there's going to be a negative effect on ratings for our shows, because of the diversion of the audience to war news. But television dollars have been up each month for the last six months, and when television media-buying is that bullish, it means the economy will turn around in six months. That bodes well for the economy postwar."
Ellen Oppenheim, executive vice president and chief marketing officer of the Magazine Publishers of America in New York, the trade organization for magazines, said caution was the watchword in her industry. "What happens in the future is totally dependent on the severity and length of the war and the resulting economic impact," she said. 
An executive at a counterpart organization for newspapers is somewhat more upbeat.
"We had been braced for a much larger impact" from the start of the war, "but thankfully it did not materialize," said Jason E. Klein, president and chief executive at the Newspaper National Network in New York, a division of the Newspaper Association of America that specializes in selling ad campaigns to national advertisers.
"While it's hard to know what never got placed in the first place, virtually all the programs we had up and running two weeks ago have pretty much all continued on a business-as-usual basis," Mr. Klein said. "And a number of cancellations that were made for this coming weekend have been reinstated, in some cases with different placement objectives such as 'not in with news.' "
