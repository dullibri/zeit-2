HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar in a Broad Retreat; Lira at Low Against Mark

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar hit a two-month low against the German mark yesterday, continuing a decline against other major currencies, on news of weakened consumer confidence in the United States economic recovery.
Meanwhile, the Italian lira fell to another historic low against the mark as a corruption scandal pushed Italy's Government closer to collapse. 
 The dollar's fall began in Europe after a Bundesbank official said the German central bank would stick to its policy of gradually easing interest rates.
The remarks disappointed dollar buyers who have been hoping for more significant reductions. Lower interest rates in Germany make dollar-denominated investments more attractive.
The interest-rate news combined with a later report of falling United States consumer confidence to push the dollar below a psychologically important level against the mark.
The report helped push the dollar to a low of 1.1615 marks before recovering modestly. It was the lowest intraday level since the dollar hit 1.6130 marks on Feb. 1.
In European trading, the dollar fell to 1.6200 German marks, from 1.6280 late Monday. By late afternoon in New York, the dollar was down to 1.6173 marks from 1.6260.
The lira continued to plunge against the mark as the Italian scandal spread. Prime Minister Giuliano Amato expressed his willingness to step down and a fifth Cabinet minister resigned after learning he was under investigation.
As a result, the mark jumped to an all-time high of 999.20 lire in European trading before easing to around 990.
Trading in yen was extremely quiet, the day before the close of Japan's fiscal year. The dollar closed in Tokyo at 116.78 yen, down from 116.88 Monday. The dollar was quoted later in London at 116.60 yen and was trading at 116.55 yen by late afternoon in New York, down from late Monday's 116.85.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's, included: 1.4945 Swiss francs, down from 1.5050; 5.4900 French francs, down from 5.5170; 1,603.00 Italian lire, down from 1,606.00, and 1.2507 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2476.

HEADLINE: Ritz-Carlton's Keys to Good Service

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
Shortly after 8 A.M., when many Atlantans are just leaving for work, 23 new employees of the Ritz-Carlton in the city's Buckhead section are getting the hotel chain's philosophy drummed into them.
"You serve, but you are not servants," says Rebecca Powell, the training manager, who conducts most of the two-day orientation for newcomers that is held each week. "You are ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen." 
 That notion generates smiles and nods from many of the newcomers, all of whom underwent at least three interviews for jobs ranging from chambermaid to concierge to quality controllers. Even the noncommittal employees seem receptive when, 90 minutes later, Jim Veil, the hotel's general manager, assures them, "You were not hired, you were selected."
The two-day orientation is just the beginning. Employee indoctrination at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company includes 100 additional hours of training, daily inspections for appearance, periodic performance reviews and an unrelenting emphasis on quality that has made the 27 Ritz-Carlton hotels world renowned for service and quality. Last year the luxury chain became the first hotel company to win a Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, which was established by Congress in 1987 to promote quality management.
Despite last year's economic turbulence, when hotel occupancy in the United States dropped to 61.7 percent from an average 62.6 percent in 1989, the Ritz-Carlton's rate was a robust 70.2 percent.
Although many hotel companies have rigorous training programs, "the Ritz-Carlton is in a class by itself," said M. L. Smith, professor of hospitality marketing at the University of Nevada's College of Hotel Administration. "They have figured out what guests want in a hotel, and they have learned how to exceed their expectations," Professor Smith said.
Yet quality and service are not the hotel chain's only draws. Discounted prices also contributed to the high occupancy rate last year. To make money, analysts say luxury hotels of Ritz-Carlton's caliber must charge almost twice the $150 average room rate at the Ritz last year. The average rate in the industry was $43.15.
There is no way to know how discounting affected profits, because the company is privately held and does not disclose financial information.
Whatever the case, financial concerns are not on the minds of new employees, who are charged with delivering quality and service. Toward the end of his second day of orientation, Randy Harris, who had worked in six other hotels in three cities and will work in housekeeping at the Ritz-Carlton, shook his head and said, "I've never seen anything like this orientation and this hotel."
 
'No Detail Too Small'
 Most hotels are in the business of selling rooms and food, Mr. Veil tells the newcomers, but Ritz-Carlton hotels are in the business of selling service and cleanliness to the top 5 percent of corporate and leisure travelers. "That means that in order for guests to see us as a necessity," he said, "no detail is too small, no request too large."
It means giving each guest a warm welcome every day, saying "Good morning" or "Good afternoon," never "Hi" or "How's it going?" It means escorting guests who ask directions, rather than pointing the way. And it means taking responsibility for a guest's complaint and seeing that it is resolved.
 
Employee Retention
 Ritz-Carlton aims to convince employees that they are important members of an elite team always looking for ways to improve. Employees are paid about the same as those at other hotels, but the company rewards exceptional performance with things like fully paid vacations. Consequently, employee turnover averages 30 percent, versus an estimated 45 percent at other luxury hotels.
"We might not be able to afford a hotel like this," said Tammy Patton, an employee at the orientation who would soon be issuing other employees clean uniforms each day, "but we can make it so people who can afford it will want to keep coming here."
 
Satisfied Customers
 That attitude is why Nancy and Harvey Heffner of Manhattan have stayed at several Ritz-Carlton hotels, including three visits in just over a year to the resort hotel in Naples, Fla.
"The hotel is elegant and beautiful," Mrs. Heffner said, "but more important is the beauty expressed by the staff. They can't do enough to please you."
When the couple's son became sick last year in Naples, the hotel staff brought him hot tea with honey at all hours of the night, she said. When Mr. Heffner had to fly home on business for a day and his return flight was delayed, a driver for the hotel waited in the lobby most of the night.
That kind of service has drawn a sizable following among conventioneers. "They not only treat us like a king when we hold our top-level meetings in their hotels, but we just never get any complaints," said Wayne Stetson, the staff vice president of the convention and meetings division of the National Association of Home Builders in Washington.
The Ritz-Carlton chain, which had estimated sales of about $600 million last year, is owned by William B. Johnson, an Atlanta real estate investor. The owner of 111 Waffle House restaurants in the Southeast and 10 Holiday Inns, he bought the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Boston in 1983, along with the Ritz-Carlton trademark. The company, which has since sold the Boston hotel, now owns only three properties -- the one in Naples, one of two Ritz-Carltons in Atlanta and one in Tysons Corner, Va., -- and has investments in a few others.
But the compnay's 11,500 employees manage all the Ritz-Carlton properties. That helps assure Ritz quality.
To underscore the importance of maintaining quality service as the organization grows, Horst H. Schulze, Ritz-Carlton's workaholic president and chief operating officer, conducts the orientation at each new hotel.
 
Getting Feedback
 After sifting through the management philosophies of W. Edward Deming, Joseph M. Juran and Philip Crosby, all of whom advocate quality products and a quality work force, Mr. Schulze and his staff created their own version of Total Quality Management -- a program designed to reduce defects in a company and to identify and satisfy customer requirements. To gauge its service, the company polls customers and hires outside auditors to pose as guests.
As if to guard against complacency, Patrick Mene, corporate director of quality, said the Baldrige award's jurors found 75 areas that needed improvement, chief among them that the hotel's suppliers improve their quality, a new goal for the chain.
"We also want to involve employees more and give them more decision-making authority," Mr. Mene said. "One of our biggest challenges is to prevent any difficulties from ever reaching the customer."

HEADLINE: Yield Slide Slows for C.D.'s And Bank Money Accounts

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The average yields that banks are offering on money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the week beginning today are down from the previous reporting period. But the rates are falling at a slower rate than in previous weeks.
Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Bank Rate Monitor, says domestic and international factors are behind the continuing slide in deposit rates. 
 "Domestically, there is the weak economic recovery acknowledged by the Fed, and you have the uncertainty surrounding tax proposals and their impact on interest rates. And those bullets haven't even hit yet," Mr. Heady said. "Internationally, you have a global recession, especially in Japan and Europe, adding a strong damper on savings yields.
"Mathematically," he added, "this translates to consumers losing on the average of one- to three-hundredths of a percentage point each week on deposit yields.
 
Treasury Rates Mixed
 Analysts often regard the direction of rates at Treasury auctions as a harbinger of trends in bank deposit rates. At the Treasury's weekly auction of new three- and six-month bills this week, rates were thinly mixed compared with the previous week. The average discount rate for a three-month bill rose 2 basis points, to 2.96 percent, while the rate for a six- month bill slipped a basis point, to 3.04 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
In the latest survey by The Bank Rate Monitor, the average New York-area commercial bank money market account rate is down 2 basis points, to 2.37 percent, and the average six-month certificate is up a basis point, to 3.08 percent.
The Chase Manhattan Bank is again showing the sharpest change among the New York banks, lowering the yield on its three-month certificate 10 basis points, to 2.28 percent. Marine Midland is lowering its money market account 16 basis points, to 2.22 percent. Apple Bank for Savings is raising the yield on a six-month certificate 9 basis points, to 2.95 percent.
Outside New York, yields at 20 large banks are unchanged for the average money market account, at 2.55 percent, but down 2 basis points for the average six-month certificate, to 2.87 percent.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, March 31, 1993. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimum vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Theaters Reporting Losses

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
The nation's nonprofit professional theaters suffered substantial losses last season in government and corporate financing, as well as a decline in subscription audiences and cutbacks in staff, theater budgets and touring productions, according to a new study of the 1991-92 season.
The survey of 182 theater organizations was conducted by the Theater Communications Group, a Manhattan-based national service organization for nonprofit professional theaters. 
The institutions surveyed, which played to a total attendance of more than 16 million during the 1991-92 season and constituted a $366 million industry, were in 112 towns and cities in 36 states and in Washington. (A number of New York City theaters were included -- among them the Manhattan Theater Club, Lincoln Center Theater, the New York Shakespeare Festival and the CSC Repertory -- but no individual financial figures for them were given.)
 
With Operating Deficits
 "The recession is the problem, and nonprofit theaters have reached a new level of fiscal crisis," said Barbara Janowitz, the Theater Communications Group's director of management, who wrote the report. "Nearly half of the theaters we surveyed ended the 1992 fiscal year with operating deficits."
An alarming trend, she said, was that the aggregate operating deficits for the 182 theaters more than doubled over the last year, to $6.5 million as compared with $2.8 million during the 1990-1991 season.
Federal support for the theaters surveyed dropped nearly 8 percent below that in the previous year, to $8.3 million. Grants from state governments declined nearly 14 percent from the previous year, to $7.5 million. And corporate support declined nearly 3 percent, to $19.4 million.
Nearly two-thirds of the theaters reported a decline in the number of their season subscribers. And for the first time in the 19-year history of the survey, the theaters' subscription audiences for their main series (that part of the subscription season offered to audiences as a package) declined 3.3 percent from the previous year.
 
The Curtain Comes Down
 Four theaters suspended operations during the season, including the Los Angeles Theater Center, the Eureka Theater in San Francisco, the Theater Project Company in St. Louis and the Snowmass/Aspen Repertory Theater in Colorado. This brings to 23 the number of companies that have been forced to close during the last five years, according to the report.
"Should the economic trends seen in the past few years continue their current pattern, theaters, having already been forced to cut back programs and staff, will be fighting for their very survival, and many more companies may fold," Ms. Janowitz said.
The survey was conducted in September and October of 1992, when a questionnaire was sent to 320 theaters, of which 182 responded. The returned questionnaires were checked against audit statements from the groups, according to the report.

HEADLINE: A Nation of Watchers Forgets How to Play

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL

 BODY:
DO people really have less free time than they once did, or do they just feel that way because they try to cram so much into their lives?
Well-respected research seems to point in contradictory directions. But one aspect of time use that gets less attention is whether people find satisfaction in their leisure time, whether it's 1 hour a day or 10. 
 The Academy of Leisure Sciences, made up of a group of academics who study time use, says North Americans are losing the skills they need to get the most benefit from their free time. Because of the ever-expanding supply of passive entertainment choices, like television and videocassettes, people don't learn activities that are harder but ultimately more gratifying.
Dr. Geoffrey Godbey, a professor of leisure studies at Pennsylvania State University and a member of the academy, says many people spend their evenings eating, drinking and watching television, which provide immediate gratification but no challenge and, perhaps, not much relaxation. "You could argue that understimulation provokes anxiety," he said. Learning to play the trumpet, or chess, would be more gratifying, he said.
That conviction is not based on a value judgment as to preferable leisure activities, he said, but on research that monitors the satisfaction people derive from their leisure-time pursuits.
Some of that research has been done by Dr. Roger Mannell, a psychologist who is chairman of the department of recreation and leisure studies at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. He and his colleagues gave pagers to 500 people and randomly beeped them nine or 10 times a day, and asked them to write down what they were doing, thinking and feeling when beeped.
The highest satisfaction, Dr. Mannell said, came when people participated in an activity they had freely committed themselves to do, even if they hadn't been initially eager about it. For example, Dr. Mannell said, when he gets home from work, he feels like reading or watching television. But he has five children, and knows he ought to play with them. "I drag myself, but I become engrossed and challenged, and when I am done, I feel better than I would have if I had watched TV," he said.
Passive activities, whether freely chosen or not, didn't seem to provide high satisfaction. "Our research suggests that higher levels of physical and intellectual energy generally yield higher dividends," he said.
Television did not rank high. "If you look at psychological states when they watch TV, they are among the most negative," he said. "They're almost affect-less."
Leisure Trends Inc. in Glastonbury, Conn., which analyzes data on time use that is gathered by the Gallup Organization, says that 33 percent of free time, on average, goes to watching television, with socializing and reading the far-distant second and third pursuits.
People may not even be conscious of the percentage of time they dedicate to television because the set is just there. William Danner, a principal in Leisure Trends, said that when people are asked what they do with their leisure, only 25 percent freely mention television. Only when asked specifically if they watched TV did the rest answer yes. "They don't even think of it anymore as a leisure activity," he said. "It's lost its novelty."
In the 7,000 interviews the company has conducted since 1990, the majority of people say they would most like to read more and see friends more often, but don't have time.
The feeling of a time shortage is so acute, he said, that "14 to 19 percent of Americans tell us they don't have any leisure time. I know they have it, but they don't think they have any."
Part of the problem comes in defining leisure.
"If you are at home and everything is a chore, then you feel you have no free time," said Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a professor of human development at the University of Chicago who is the author of "Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience." (Harper Perennial, 1991.)
Learning to use time well, though, takes time and effort. "Daydreaming is a skill you need to learn," he said. "Or writing poetry. Or doing mathematics. Many people don't teach their children to enjoy activities that require the use of skills, like chess or bridge. They don't have to be taught Nintendo."
Ruth Sills, a homemaker whose children are grown, volunteers for an agency on Long Island that taught her how to help people overcome phobias. She takes people out into the world to face their fears, whether it be in an elevator, on a bridge, or whatever. "I think of it as something I like to do," she said. "I don't think of it as work."
Mrs. Sills, who is "over 70", said she feels she has time to do everything she wants to do, unlike many people in their 20's and 30's, who are more likely to feel rushed because they are starting families and building careers.
But at any age, and with whatever level of obligation, choices are made about time use. Thomas L. Goodale, a professor in the department of health, sports and leisure studies at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and the editor of The Journal of Leisure Science, believes that people would have many pursuits to choose from if they just turned off the television. "If you gave people 20 hours a week," he asked, "what would they do?"
He knows what he does with that time. Every morning and every evening, he walks for 40 minutes to and from his office. "I'm the only person I've met in northern Virginia who walks to work," he said. "I enjoy the walk. I hear birds sing."

HEADLINE: Cuts in Intelligence Budget Stay on Schedule

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Spooked Over Intelligence Cuts" (editorial, March 18), you state that I told the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence that I "could absorb a $1 billion cut in next year's budget but not much more -- a snub of Mr. Clinton's campaign pledge to find $7.5 billion in cuts over five years." 
 Based on this alleged gap between the President's views and mine, you express deep concern about my "becoming a captive of the old-boy bookkeepers" and urged the President not to be a "sucker."
In the first place, it is ridiculous to assert that there is any inconsistency between a promised $1 billion reduction in the intelligence budget or anything else in the first year of a five-year period and a pledge of a reduction of several billion more over the full five years. Still less is the first a snub of the second.
Moreover, in the same public testimony to which you refer, I pointed out that during the campaign President Clinton proposed a multiyear plan (for fiscal year 1993 and thereafter) of reductions in national and tactical intelligence, below the levels for those years proposed last summer by the Bush Administration.
President Clinton's plan, I noted, was for reductions of approximately $1 billion in 1993 and $1.5 billion a year thereafter from the Bush Administration plan. (This would total $7 billion in the aggregate over five years.) I explicitly testified that, in the aggregate, over these years, we could manage this magnitude of reductions "and we might even be able to do a little bit better than that."
I am developing for the President a sensible and economical multiyear plan for the use of intelligence resources. Public statements about its dimensions, as it develops, must necessarily be limited to protect intelligence sources and methods.
Some flexibility is essential in light of the complex and troubled international situation. The public record is clear, moreover, that intelligence budgets have been cut substantially in real terms over the last three years. Our oversight and appropriations committees in Congress will be fully informed in detail, of course, as we develop our plans.
But with respect to the public statements that I or any other Government official may make on this subject, is it asking too much that your editorials demonstrate the attention to facts -- in this case, to statements clearly on the public record -- that your news articles typically show?
What reflects extremely poorly on you is to invent from whole cloth a nonexistent snub by me of the President's plan as an excuse to deliver opinions in highly distorted terms about the nature of this mythical dispute.

HEADLINE: U.S. Rejects British-French Bosnia Peace Step

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 30

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has rejected a plan by Britain and France for a new Security Council resolution giving the international community's full support to the Bosnian peace plan of the two Balkan mediators, former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, diplomats said today.
Britain, France and Spain, the three Council members from the European Community, want the Security Council to give its unqualified endorsement to the peace plan, which the Croats and Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina have both now accepted, and then threaten the Serbs with a variety of new economic sanctions unless they sign the accord within 15 days. 
 But the Administration has refused to go along with this approach. Part of the reason may be that President Clinton criticized the Vance-Owen plan in his election campaign as rewarding the Serbs for aggression, but he has not come up with his own proposal.
But diplomats also think the United States does not want to become too firmly committed to the plan in case the Serbs reject it and renew their assault and the Muslims then ask Washington to lift the Security Council arms embargo so they can rearm and fight back, as they have pledged.
 
An American Suggestion
 The United States suggested that instead of endorsing the settlement worked out by Mr. Vance and Lord Owen the Security Council should just give its backing to their effort. But Britain argued that Bosnia's ethnic factions cannot be asked to carry out a peace effort but only the settlement that results from such an effort.
The four parties are now discussing a compromise that would involve the Council's endorsing "the agreements the Bosnian factions have signed so far," or some similar language.
The dispute shows that the Administration remains sensitive to domestic criticism of the Vance-Owen plan under which the Serbian forces would be required to reduce the amount of territory they control from 70 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina to about 43 percent and accept the country's division into 10 autonomous provinces under a weak central government.
But after he accepted the Vance-Owen plan last week, President Alya Izetbegavic, who heads the predominantly Muslim Government in the besieged capital of Sarajevo, said he would cancel his acceptance if the Serbs did not agree to a rapid cease-fire, as they have now done.
 
Serb Parliament Called
 The Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan Karadzic, who considers himself president of the self-styled Republic of Srbska, has convened his Parliament in the town of Bileca this Friday to discuss the peace plan that he refused to sign here last week after President Izetbegavic finally agreed to it.
If the Bosnian Serbs do not accept the Vance-Owen peace plan within 15 days of the new resolution's adoption, the Security Council plans to tighten further the trade embargo it has already imposed on the Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro.
It will ban the shipment of all goods through Yugoslavia and tighten controls on the movement of ships along the Danube. It plans to impound all Yugoslavian ships, rolling stock and trucks found outside the country and freeze financial assets held overseas.

 
 
"Balkan Update"

The cease-fire appeared to hold again yesterday across Bosnia and Herzegovina, despite scattered reports of violence and warnings from Bosnian radio to civilians to be wary of snipers.
In Sarajevo, a military court, holding what it called a "war crimes trial," imposed death sentences on two Serbs for a rampage of murder and rape while in the Serbian army last year.
Trying to take advantage of the relative calm, the United Nations prepared to evacuate more Muslims by road and helicopter from Srebrenica in the east. On Monday, 3,000 were taken out on trucks.
The commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, Lieut. Gen. Philippe Morillon of France, described the cease-fire as an "open door for peace" that must be rapidly exploited, and said he had told Bosnian and Serbian nationalist leaders that it was "not the time for them to take justice into their own hands" and that the better solution would have been for the Bosnians to await the time when a United Nations war-crimes tribunal could be established.
Efforts continued in Belgrade to persuade the Serbs and, more important, the Bosnian Serbs to sign the United Nations-sponsored peace accord, which the Bosnian Muslims and Croats have already done. This would create a new Bosnia, divided into 10 autonomous areas. A Russian envoy, Vitaly Churkin, planned to meet with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and plans to meet with Bosnian Serbs today. Bosnian Serbs scheduled a meeting for Friday to decide whether to accept the United Nations peace plan.
But at the United Nations, the United States refused to join with Britain and France in endorsing the peace plan drawn up by the United Nations mediators, Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen. Also at the United Nations, the Security Council yesterday renewed for three months its 22,000-member force in the former Yugoslavia.
In Washington, Secretary of State Warren Christopher told a Senate committee that the United States hoped to get the Security Council to vote to enforce the ban on Serbian flights over Bosnia.
