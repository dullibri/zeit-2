HEADLINE: LOS CEDRALES JOURNAL;
On Disputed Land, Paraguay Reaps a Whirlwind

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS CEDRALES, Paraguay

 BODY:
As his five children played barefoot in a manioc field, Cesar Galeano folded and unfolded an eviction order and wondered what the next few weeks would bring.
In December, the police arrived at the squatter settlement here and dismantled 70 shanties with chainsaws. In January, just before harvest time, a tractor arrived at the homesteads and plowed under 150 acres of cotton. 
 Here in eastern Paraguay, a peasant occupation of a German company's farmland is part of a nationwide upheaval caused two years ago by a coup that ended the 35-year rule of Gen. Alfredo Stroessner.
The overnight collapse of Latin America's longest-running Government unleashed pent-up social demands in a country where the majority of the four million inhabitants still live in the countryside.
With 78 percent of farm and ranch land in the hands of 41 foreign companies and several hundred Paraguayans, peasants started to organize, occupying land.
"I don't think that private property that is unjustly distributed is sacred," said Mr. Galeano, a onetime motorcycle mechanic who is a leader of the 362 families squatting on the German company's land here.
 
Detentions Called Shocking
 Often making large estates owned by foreigners, largely Germans, Japanese and Brazilians, their target, about 12,000 peasant families jumped over Paraguay's slow-moving land redistribution bureaucracy and occupied land.
After a period of indecision and negotiations, the new Government of President Andres Rodriguez is fighting back with tough tactics that, critics say, differ little from General Stroessner's.
"The sheer number of detentions is shocking," Americas Watch said recently in a report on violence surrounding Paraguay's land disputes. Noting that 167 detentions of peasants took place in the last two years of the Stroessner Government, the New York-based human rights group reported that 800 detentions took place since Mr. Rodriguez, also an army general, was elected President in May 1989.
To enforce eviction orders, rural policemen have burned squatters' homes, beaten peasants and stolen their property, Americas Watch asserted.
"The police take machetes, watches, household property, chainsaws and motorcycles," said Leonardo Ayala Balmoris, a lawyer for a Roman Catholic group that defends the squatters.
 
'Little Has Changed'
 To critics, the violence in the countryside is evidence that the change in Government has not resulted in a change in the traditional tactics of rural control.
"As in many countries, the revolution starts in the city and is slow in getting to the countryside," Juan E. Mendez, executive director of Americas Watch, said in an interview in Asuncion, Paraguay's capital. "Allowing the courts, the police and the army to be manipulated in favor of landowners shows that little has changed."
In response, the Government says property rights must be respected to encourage foreign and domestic investment in agriculture, Paraguay's economic mainstay. Publicity over illegal occupations, Government officials say, draws attention away from a program that is to distribute land to 30,000 certified landless peasants in a two-year period ending this December.
"We have inherited a very serious land problem," said Basilio Nikiphoroff, president of the Rural Welfare Institute, Paraguay's land redistribution agency. He estimated that 50,000 families want land to farm.
Working within the law, the American-trained agronomist continued, the Government is establishing 66 new agricultural colonies that offer settler families access roads, soil surveys and other support. A computer system weeds out land speculaors.
 
'A Tough and a Sad Job'
 In contrast, Mr. Nikiphoroff said, the Government will not give land to peasants who use pressure tactics, like the peasants who have occupied the Roman Catholic Cathedral in Asuncion for the last six months.
"We could empty the cathedral but it would just fill up again," he said of the peasant protesters. "The image of the occupied cathedral is the image of a democratic country."
Responding to the Americas Watch criticism, Mr. Nikiphoroff said all evictions take place with judicial orders.
"The police have to break the shanties and knock down the churches," he said of makeshift churches raised by the homesteaders. "The police have a tough and a sad job."
Despite the Government's hard line, many Paraguayans say they believe that land occupations will continue, especially around election time. New multiparty elections for Congress and for mayorships have meant a sudden political enfranchisement of Paraguay's impoverished rural majority.
 
Courting the Squatters
 At Los Cedrales the other day, the new political reality was on view.
In the morning, Mayor Miguel Angel Riquelme Barreto commiserated with the town's largest landowner, saying, "Public authorities can't support these kinds of invasions."
Later in the day, the Mayor's lunch was interrupted by a truck carrying Mr. Galeano and about 40 squatters who were returning from a demonstration against eviction.
The Mayor, who faces re-election in May, waved cheerily from his veranda and sent his wife out to the potential voters with a bottle of rum.

HEADLINE: New Alliance Plans Housing in 20 Cities

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN TELTSCH

 BODY:
Seven philanthropies and the Prudential Insurance Company of America are beginning an ambitious program to revitalize poor neighborhoods in 20 major cities.
Their coalition, called the National Community Development Initiative, will build or restore 7,500 housing units for low- and moderate-income families. In some cities, including New York, the coalition will set up child-care centers. 
 What makes the program special is that the projects will be carried out by Community Development Corporations, which are local nonprofit groups that have had solid track records over the last two decades in transforming decaying neighborhoods through the development of housing, commercial and industrial prjects.
"No foundation and no financial institution in this world can reverse the scourges of poverty or provide adequate housing with money alone," said John Mutz, the president of the Lilly Endowment, one of the philanthropies involved. "We must rely on local heroes who will invent strategies, muster consensus and see a plan through."
 
$62.5 Million in Grants and Loans
 The eight financial sponsors have committed $62.5 million in grants and loans, which they say is the most money ever amassed from private sources for neighborhood renewal projects. The Rockefeller Foundation, the Lilly Endowment and Prudential each gave $15 million. Smaller shares were given by the Pew Charitable Trusts, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Knight Foundation and the Surdna Foundation.
The sponsors expect the program to raise at least $500 million more within three years from banks, government agencies, investors and local foundations to complete construction. A crucial element in attracting these resources, they said, was the participation of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. The corporation, known as Freddie Mac, will guarantee financing for $100 million in housing loans to the Community Development Corporations -- providing a stable source of long-term and low-interest money that has not previously been available.
"Families in these communities who borrow to rebuild their lives and their neighborhoods are some of the toughest, most determined performers around," Peter C. Goldmark, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, said Wednesday at a Washington news conference, where the project was announced."Even from a narrow business view, I'd rather put my money in a neighborhood C.D.C. than in Donald Trump's Taj Mahal."
 
Different Plans for Cities
 The programs will use different strategies in different cities:
*In Boston, the focus will be on preserving or creating 1,000 housing units for single occupants, many of them now living in shelters.
*In the District of Columbia, 800 deteriorating rental units will be rebuilt. Tenants will not be forced to move as they often are in renovation projects. Some, in fact, will be employed by the renovators.
*In Columbus, Ohio, two Methodist parishes and a Baptist parish are helping to form a group to create and improve housing in a deteriorating neighborhood of 2,000 families.
*In New York, plans call for 15 child-care centers for 1,000 children in or near the housing being rehabilitated. In addition, three sites in Brooklyn, Manhattan and the South Bronx will offer broader programs known as Community Life Centers, providing services like child care, job training as well as other educational programs and family counseling.
 
Role of Two Intermediaries
 The other cities are Atlanta, Baltimore, Chattanooga, Tenn., Chicago, Cleveland, Miami, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Newark, the Oakland-San Francisco Bay area, Philadelphia, Portland, San Antonio, Seattle and St. Paul. In Miami, renovation has already begun on an apartment building for 82 elderly tenants.
Two of the country's leading development organizations will act as intermediaries between the eight financial sponsors and the Community Development Corporations, and will seek additional financing for the projects. One of the organizations, the New York-based Local Initiatives Support Corporation, created by the Ford Foundation and corporate and philanthropic sponsors, has over 11 years induced 700 corporations, foundations and financial institutions to commit more than $420 million for community development, and attracted $1.4 billion from government and private sources for 26,000 housing units and commercial ventures. The other development group, the Enterprise Foundation, established in 1982 by the Maryland developer James W. Rouse, has helped create or rehabilitate 13,500 housing units for lower-income families in 40 cities.
Until now, few philanthropies have ventured to provide financing to Community Development Corporations, which have spread to 2,500 communities from an experimental start 24 years ago in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. Five of the sponsors of the project announced yesterday will be making their first grants or loans to the local groups.
"Unfortunately, C.D.C's are not well known by potential supporters," said Mitchell Sviridoff, a former president of the initiatives group who advised the coalition. "Most folks think C.D.C. means Centers for Disease Control."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mostly Higher; Gold Prices Rise Sharply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced against other major currencies yesterday, lifted overseas by the cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war and on domestic markets by speculation that United States interest rates would remain stable.
Gold moved sharply higher in response to the gulf developments. The price of the March contract advanced $5.70 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $367.40 a troy ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $366 a troy ounce, up $5.20. 
 Dealers said the end of fighting in the Middle East gave support to the dollar in Europe, where traders viewed the cease-fire as a good sign for the United States economy.
In later New York trading, analysts said the market was shifting its focus from the war to the latest economic data.
 
Purchasing Survey
 A survey of purchasing executives in the Midwest found that business activity picked up for manufacturing companies in February. The survey, taken by the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago, is considered a precursor to the national purchasing managers' survey, which is scheduled to be released today.
Currency traders believed the purchasing managers survey might relieve some of the pressure on the Federal Reserve to again relax interest rates to stimulate business. Since higher yields make the dollar more attractive, the possibility that interest rates will not fall any further moved the United States currency higher.
Mike Faust, a currency market analyst with MMS International in Chicago, said traders were looking ahead to February employment figures to be released next week.
In the meantime, "the general view is that the Fed is taking a less aggressive stand toward easing" interest rates, Mr. Faust said.
The dollar rose to 133.03 Japanese yen in New York from late Wednesday's 132.245. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell 0.85 yen, to a closing 131.95 yen, and later in London it was quoted at 132.98.
The British pound fell to $1.912 in New York, from $1.9177 late Wednesday. In London, sterling fell to $1.9105, from $1.9155 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.52425 German marks, up from 1.5225; 1.3248 Swiss francs, up from 1.3163; 5.1890 French francs, up from 5.1780; 1,139.00 Italian lire, up from 1,137.75, and 1.14975 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15145.
While gold prices were rising, silver moved sharply higher in New York on speculation about a possible strike by Peruvian silver miners, an action that could drive up the price of the metal.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Ford Plans to Reduce Salaried Work Force

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Faced with mounting losses, the Ford Motor Company announced plans today to cut its salaried work force through layoffs and early retirements, in an effort to save $3 billion by the end of the year.
Speaking by closed-circuit television to the company's 53,000 salaried employees in the United States, Ford's chairman and chief executive, Harold A. Poling, said, "It's becoming increasingly clear that some salaried layoffs are inevitable in the short term." 
 Mr. Poling said the company had already cut $1.5 billion and planned to cut a similar amount by the end of this year.
A Ford spokesman said the company would not know how many people would be laid off until April, the deadline for workers to accept early retirement.
Automotive analysts said the plan outlined today increased the likelihood that Ford would cut its dividend. The company's next dividend meeting is scheduled for April 11.
The deepest slump in car and truck sales since the recession of 1982 has auto makers scrambling to hold down their costs. In recent weeks, the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation have both announced plans to reduce their salaried work forces, and G.M. also halved its dividend.
Ford posted a loss of $519 million in the fourth quarter, and Mr. Poling acknowledged today that it appeared likely that the company would "have a substantial loss in the first quarter of this year."
The cost-cutting measures announced today, which affect 140,000 salaried employees worldwide, include freezing salaries for top executives for the next year and limiting raises for other salaried employees. The company has also suspended matching contributions to employee savings and stock investment plans.
Ford's stock was up $2.125 a share today, to $32.625, on the New York Stock Exchange as all of the Big Three auto makers showed solid advances. Several Wall Street analysts issued favorable opinions on the companies on the expectation that the slump in auto sales would ease as the Mideast war ends and the United States economy recovers.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending In Big Drop

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Consumer spending, which slipped severely in the final quarter of last year, dropped an additional six-tenths of a percent in January, the Government said today. It was the steepest decline in consumer spending in more than four years.
Contributing to the cutback was a drop of five-tenths of 1 percent in personal incomes, the largest such decline in more than two years. 
 "Consumers are in a lot of trouble," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.
 
$3.72 Trillion Rate
 The Commerce Department said spending in January fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.72 trillion, the steepest slide since a 1.3 percent decline in January 1987 and more than erasing an advance of five-tenths of a percent in December.
John E. Silvia, an economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said the decline was more evidence that the January-to-March period of this year would be the second straight quarterly contraction -- meeting the classic confirmation of recession. Consumer spending provides two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that the gross national product, the total output of the nation's goods and services, fell at an annual rate of 2 percent from October through December.
The G.N.P. report included a huge 2.9 percent drop in consumer spending for the final quarter of last year.
 
No Money to Spend
 And while the apparent end of the Persian Gulf war is expected to increase consumer confidence and provide an initial boost in spending, Mr. Steinberg said any rebound was not expected to be robust.
"The problem has not been a lack of confidence," he said. "The problem is that consumers don't have any money to spend."
Indeed, the drop of five-tenths of a percent in personal incomes reported today by the Commerce Department was the largest decline since a similar drop in November 1988.
Incomes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.72 trillion, down from a gain of six-tenths of a percent posted in December.
 
6.2% Unemployment Rate
 The Labor Department reported earlier this month that the nation's unemployment rate climbed to 6.2 percent in January, its highest level since 1987. Over the seven months that ended in January, 1.2 million people have become jobless.
And while some incomes rose because of a Federal Government pay rise and an increase in Government benefit payments, it was offset by a decrease in farm subsidies and a jump in Social Security withholding, the Commerce Department said.
The report said Americans' disposable incomes, incomes after taxes, sank by five-tenths of 1 percent, erasing a similar gain the previous month.
As a result, Americans' savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, edged up, to 4.3 percent in January from 4.2 percent a month earlier.
 
Inflation Adjustment
 The spending and income figures were not adjusted for inflation. When adjusted, spending actually fell by 1.1 percent, the largest decline since a 2.2 percent drop in January 1987. Inflation-adjusted spending rose by four-tenths of a percent in December.
Disposable incomes, when adjusted for inflation, slumped by nine-tenths of a percent after a five-tenths of a percent gain in December.
Two critical components of the income category, wages and salaries, fell by $14.2 billion after rising $22.8 billion a month earlier. They were unchanged in November.
Spending on durable goods, items ranging from cars to computers that are expected to last more than three years, plunged by $23.6 billion after a $2.4 billion drop in December.
 The Commerce Department said the decline "was mainly in purchases of motor vehicles," continuing the pattern reported in the fourth-quarter G.N.P. The October-to-December decline "was centered in output of motor vehicles," it said.
Spending on nondurable goods, which include food and clothing, was virtually flat, edging up just $200 million after a $1.1 billion decline the previous month.
And spending on services, which until recently had been immune from most recessionary pressures, slowed to a $2.4 billion gain, from a $20.9 billion increase a month earlier.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: WORLD REACTION;
Now, Allies and Others Begin Offering Competing Bids for Postwar Future

BYLINE: By Alan Riding, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 28

 BODY:
Having stood firmly alongside the United States during the climactic days of the Persian Gulf war, Western European governments are quietly preparing to compete with Washington for political influence in the Middle East now that the fighting is over.
The allied victory was hailed across Europe today, with Britain and France particularly cheered by the low loss of life among their combat troops. But already the focus of attention seemed to be shifting to the political and diplomatic challenges ahead. 
 "If we cannot win the peace, our military victory could turn out to be a Pyrrhic victory," the Italian Foreign Minister, Gianni De Michelis, said today. "Winning the peace will be much more difficult than winning the military conflict."
In London today, there were no victory parades or pealing church bells, but British political leaders in the House of Commons paid tribute to President Bush and their own and allied forces for their swift success.
"The victories of peace will take longer than the battles of war," Prime Minister John Major said in the House of Commons. Regional security, he said, "must also deal with the other problems of the region, above all, that of the Palestinians."
Britain and France feel confident that their participation in the war has already earned them places at future negotiating tables. But Germany, Italy, Spain and other European Community nations are also claiming a role in promoting security, stability and development in the postwar Arab world.
 
France Takes 'No Orders'
 Signaling France's intention to play an active role after the war, President Francois Mitterrand said last weekend, "We will spell out the objectives that we consider just, and no one will give us orders." France will demonstrate, he added, that "it has not gone to war against Islam or Arabs."
Today, the European Community promised "a global approach" to the problems of the Middle East, a phrase that Community foreign ministers defined last week as dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Palestinian question and the Lebanese crisis as well as the aftermath of the gulf war.
Driving the diplomacy is acute awareness that Europe's historical, cultural and geographical links to the Arab world make its interests different from those of the United States. It therefore hopes to insure that Washington is not alone in determining the future of the region.
It also wants to protect European companies that have long done good business in the Middle East. The only recent sign of disharmony between London and Washington came last week when Britain complained that most contracts for the reconstruction of Kuwait were going to American companies.
In the months leading up to the war, though, the 12 showed anything but unity. Unable to agree on a joint response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Britain strongly backed the United States, France offered its own peace plans and other nations refused to send ground troops to Saudi Arabia.
 
Regional Bloc Frays
 Yet now that the fighting is over, the cohesion of the anti-Iraq coalition may again be tested by differences within Europe as well as by competition between Europe and the United States. Indeed, in recent weeks European governments have acted more individually than as a regional bloc.
Britain, for instance, has strong historical and economic ties to Kuwait and the gulf emirates and seems most interested in helping to build a security system in the region, albeit without direct participation of British ground troops. In this, its position is almost identical to Washington's.
For Bonn, the war has been a diplomatic disaster, as Germany was criticized for its reluctance to help the allies and embarrassed by revelations that German companies developed Iraq's chemical weapons capacity. Earlier this month, it sent Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher to Israel and then to Jordan, Egypt and Syria in the hope of patching up ties.
France, Spain and Italy, which have large populations of North African immigrants, are most alarmed by the deterioration of their relations with Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, where pro-Iraqi sentiments were running strong. "We must avoid hurting Arab public opinion that felt solidarity with Iraq," a French politician said today.
Paris, Madrid and Rome also believe that the bitter legacy of Iraq's defeat can be buried in these and other Arab countries only if the Palestinian problem is addressed. But they recognize that only Washington can persuade Israel to take part in an international conference that tackles this question.
European governments do at least agree that the Palestine Liberation Organization has destroyed its credibility by supporting Iraq in the war. "The question of the P.L.O. will have to be looked at differently in the light of many of its reactions in recent weeks," Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said today.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Oil Goes Above $19 a Barrel; OPEC Talks Are Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices rose above $19 a barrel yesterday as a new calm in the Persian Gulf was quickly overtaken by other concerns in the futures market's first postwar trading session.
"That war is not a factor any more," said Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. "The war premium is completely gone from this market, and all the focus now is on the upcoming OPEC meeting on March 11. It's a complete turn now to look at fundamentals." 
 Perceptions that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will soon move to cut back production have been pushing oil higher much of the week.
Crude oil for delivery in April settled yesterday at $19.16 a barrel, up 30 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Just a week earlier, crude had settled below $19 a barrel for the first time since the Persian Gulf crisis began with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. At the market's peak, in October, oil traded above $40 a barrel.
But oil traders discounted the end of the war last week, and crude prices have been inching ahead on speculation that the postwar oil market will not be as glutted with crude as some experts had predicted.
The war ended Wednesday night when President Bush said that the United States-led coalition forces were suspending their offensive military operations against Iraq. By yesterday oil analysts were no longer using the words "war" and "peace" to explain what was moving the price of petroleum up and down.
"People are focusing on what OPEC is going to do and that there is more damage than they thought in the Middle East," said Sandy Weinberger, an oil broker at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Oil experts said it could be months or even years before Iraq and Kuwait could repair all the damage the war brought to their oil industries.
Refined petroleum products also traded higher, as the futures contracts for their delivery in March expired in New York.
Unleaded gasoline for delivery in March settled at 67.92 cents a gallon, up another 0.72 cent after several strong gains in recent sessions.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
'Junk Bond' Price Rise Continues

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of high-yield "junk bonds" continued to rise yesterday and finished February with their best-ever monthly return.
An index of 339 high-yield issues compiled by the First Boston Corporation posted a return of 8.6 percent in February, the highest monthly return since the firm began compiling monthly statistics in 1985. For the first two months, the index has posted a return of 11.6 percent. 
 Robert Long, head of high-yield research at First Boston, said the rise in junk prices was a result of bargain-hunting, as well as the recent sharp rise in the stock market.
 
'Market Was Clearly Oversold'
 "The high-yield market was clearly oversold from years of negative news," Mr. Long said, "and the stock market seems to be indicating that people are confident the recession will be brief. If the latter is true, and recovery comes quickly, the high-yield market should have significant upside potential from here."
Concern that the economy may be about to improve was also prevalent in the secondary market for Treasury securities yesterday, but with the opposite result: prices fell and interest rates rose.
A speedy end to the recession would benefit investors in high-yield securities because a recovery would probably reduce the risk that companies that have issued junk bonds would fail.
 
Effect of 'Bombing Baghdad'
 "Market psychology took a tremendous turn for the better the night we started bombing Baghdad," said David Fineman, a high-yield trader at Jeffries & Company. "At this point, confidence has improved to the point where the market could take a new issue."
Although a number of less-than-investment-grade companies have sold issues through private placements, it has been about a year since a company held a public offering of high-yield securities.
Mr. Fineman and other high-yield traders said that prices of most issues rose by about a quarter to a half of a point yesterday and that gains of that magnitude have been recorded steadily over the last two weeks.
The price improvement has pushed the yield on First Boston's index down to 16.8 percent, from 18.4 percent at the end of January. The interest rate differential, or spread, relative to Treasury issues of comparable maturity has narrowed to 9.09 percentage points, from 10.85 a month ago.
 
Unloading AAA-Rated Securities
 As high-yield investors have been making money on the prospect of an early end to the recession, participants in the AAA-rated Treasury securities market have been unloading positions in the last week or so for fear a recovery would increase inflationary pressures. Investors in highly rated fixed-income securities dislike any increase in inflation because it erodes the value of the asset.
Some signs that might presage an economic rebound were apparent yesterday, but signs of continued weakness were in evidence, too. Traders chose to concentrate on the former.
Specifically, a survey of purchasing managers in the Chicago area suggested that economic activity during February improved marginally from a month earlier, even though it remained at a low level.
 
Effect of Money Supply Report
 And prices moved lower later in the day after the Federal Reserve Board reported that all three measures of the nation's money supply posted larger-than-expected increases in the week ended Feb. 18.
Specifically, traders and analysts said they were surprised with the $6.8 billion increase in M-2, the monetary aggregate the Fed watches most closely.
Earlier this year, the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, expressed concern about sluggish growth in the monetary aggregates. In so doing, Mr. Greenspan seemed to suggest that the weekly numbers had regained lost importance in determining future policy moves.
"Right now, M-2 growth is just under its interim target," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International. "At the moment, there is no monetary imperative for the Fed to do anything. Everybody in the market was loaded to the gills expecting rates to come down, and they have been disillusioned."
Essentially overlooked was a report showing that personal income and consumption expenditures fell sharply in January.
 
The Secondary Market
 In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 7 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 96 11/32, down 3/4 point, to yield 8.20 percent, up from 8.13 percent late Wednesday.
Among note issues, the 7 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 98 5/32, down 13/32, to yield 8.02 percent. And the 6 3/4 percent two-year notes were offered at 99 13/32, down 1/8 point, to yield 7.07 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved higher.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 6.03 percent, up 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by 4 basis points, to a late offered rate of 6.05 percent.
 
Corporate Offerings
 A number of issues were offered in the investment-grade corporate bond market yesterday, including a competitive offering of $150 million worth of first and refunding mortgage bonds for the Duke Power Company.
The 8 3/4 percent securities, which mature March 1, 2021, were priced at $96.457, to yield 9.096 percent, 95 basis points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 3/4 percent bonds of 2021 at the time of pricing.
A bid from Merrill Lynch won the issue, which is rated AA-2 by Moody's Investors Service and AA-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation. The bonds are nonrefundable for five years.
In the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds, traders said that prices of most widely quoted issues were unchanged to down as much as 1/4 point.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
What Happens To Oil Prices?

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
AN effort to assess the economic consequences of the crushing of Iraq and the expulsion of Saddam Hussein's forces from Kuwait must start with the effect on oil prices and supplies.
It was the Iraqi leader's aim, long before the invasion of Kuwait, to gain more oil resources, force up oil prices and achieve the wealth and arms he needed to dominate the Arab world. After being frustrated by Iran, he turned against Kuwait. 
 Last summer, in the midst of an oil glut partly caused by Kuwait's frantic step-up of sales to the West, Iraq stepped up its pressure on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, among others, acceded. On July 27 an OPEC agreement raised the target price to $21 a barrel. At the time, John H. Lichtblau, a leading oil analyst, said of the agreement: "It's a sea change. Higher prices were always within OPEC's grasp if they adhered to discipline. This time, discipline is guaranteed by a principal player which carries a loaded gun."
In the new issue of Foreign Policy, Prof. M. A. Adelman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology writes: "As a beneficiary of this increase, Saudi Arabia conveniently ignored the Iraqi threat. But then the enforcer, like many before him, decided there was more profit as a hijacker."
Now that the enforcer-hijacker's power has been broken, what happens to the oil price? Richard T. McCormack, Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, said in an interview yesterday, "That depends on whether Saudi Arabia decides to keep its oil production up." He credited the Saudis with "averting a bad problem" during the oil embargo and the war.
Despite the run-up past $40 a barrel early in the Persian Gulf confrontation, the oil price has come down almost to where it was a couple of weeks before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last Aug. 2, but it is still well above the $13 price that Saudi light crude touched last June. Oil closed yesterday at $19.16.
Mr. McCormack noted that OPEC's target price was still $21 a barrel, but said he favored "letting the market do its thing." He opposed "a misguided attempt" by the United States or other governments to try to set the price.
But Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and other OPEC members can be expected to make a strong effort to stabilize the price at $21, the target set before the Iraqi invasion. They will argue that such a price will be crucial to pay for the reconstruction of Kuwait, including the cleanup of the oil-polluted gulf. They also argue that they need the money for plan to redistribute wealth to the poor Arab states, ostensibly to assuage the anger of poor Arab individuals and states against rich Arabs and their Western allies.
Skeptics say such arguments are only rationalizations for the wealthy oil producers' desire to stabilize prices at a high level.
But they may get some support in the West. Some American officials, who insisted on anonymity, said France would try to support the Arabs in this effort to stabilize oil prices, for two reasons: first, because President Francois Mitterrand is a Socialist and favors redistribution of income, and second and more important, because France wants to puts its arm around the shoulder of wealthy Arab countries and be in a position to get big contracts for building roads, air bases, factories, generating plants and weapons.
But there could well be conflict within the United States Government on whether to seek a stabilized oil price at a high level; this is a position that might be supported both by contractors or oil producers looking for business in the Middle East and by domestic producers seeking wider profit maragins. Factors strengthening forces that want to see the Arab oil states earn more would be the huge United States budget deficit and the opposition to using taxpayer dollars to finance reconstruction in the gulf.
Mr. McCormack contends, however, that it would be impossible to stabilize the oil price at a high level, even if the United States wanted to, because of the competition from natural gas, coal, nuclear and other energy sources. Further, he said, OPEC now controls less than half the world's oil. "All previous oil price run-ups," he said, "have resulted, without exception, from political acts, and it is a complete illusion that we could or would do that now -- nobody is prepared for it." Nevertheless, he expects OPEC, trying to counter the market, to "do its thing."
The resolution of these forces, in his view, will be an oil price of about $18. Professor Adelman thinks that with wide oscillations that price may be about right in the year ahead. Some oil industry analysts put the average price somewhat lower -- at $15 a barrel.
The elimination of Iraq as the enforcer or hijacker makes it likely that a lower price than OPEC's $21 target will prevail, and the lower price will help to support American and world economic recovery. So, too, will the ample flow of contracts to United States companies and the replenishment of military stockpiles in the near future. Such factors are not great enough, relative to gross national product, to provide the basis for expecting a boom, but they do support expectations of a gradual American recovery.

Wal-Mart's Net Up 13%; 2 Others Fall

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's fastest-growing retailer, yesterday reported record profits and sales for the fourth quarter and the year ended Jan. 31. But two other leading chains, the J. C. Penney Company and the May Department Stores Company, said their fourth-quarter nets fell below those of the previous year.
But despite Wal-Mart's higher earnings and the other companies' disappointing fourth-quarter earnings, investors showed a mixed reaction. Wal-Mart's shares closed lower yesterday, while Penney and May's stocks advanced. 
 "The companies' results are all in line with expectations," said Robert Raiff, research director of C. J. Lawrence & Company, in New York. "Only a couple of retailers were expected to show full-year rises in net income. People expected more from Wal-Mart because of its great record. May has become the biggest department-store operator, while Penney's seems to have lost direction."
Commenting on the retailing outlook, William R. Howell, Penney's chairman and chief executive, said, "Despite the continuing weak consumer demand in 1991, we believe J. C. Penney is well positioned to resume its pattern of sales and earnings growth as soon as the recession clouds lift and consumers once again display confidence in their own, and the country's, well-being."
While yesterday's results showed that Wal-Mart remained America's most profitable retailer, it is not quite yet the largest in sales. Sears, Roebuck & Company still retains that position with sales in the year ended January of $33.95 billion, or about $1.3 billion more than Wal-Mart's $32.6 billion and even more ahead of the K Mart Corporation's $32.1 billion. But given Wal-Mart's 20 percent-plus growth rate in sales versus Sears's much smaller one, analysts expect Wal-Mart to become No. 1 in a month or two.
Following are details of the companies' results:
 
Wal-Mart
Wal-Mart reported a 13 percent rise in fourth-quarter earnings, with its net totaling $481.8 million, or 42 cents a share, against $425.9 million, or 38 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 28 percent, to $10.36 billion from $8.11 billion.
Wal-Mart was the only American retailer to record at least $1 billion in annual net income. Its net for the year rose 19 percent, to $1.29 billion, or $1.14 a share, from $1.08 billion, or 95 cents a share, the previous year. Annual sales rose 26 percent, to $32.6 billion from $25.81 billion.
But investors reacted with disappointment to the quarterly earnings rise, having expected Wal-Mart's traditional gain of more than 20 percent each year. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, the company's shares lost $1.25, to $35.375.
David Glass, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart, described the year just ended as "one of tremendous challenge and opportunity."
 
J. C. Penney
Penney said its net income in the final quarter fell 44 percent, to $206 million, or $1.68 a share, from $367 million, or $2.95 a share in the period a year earlier. Sales were flat at $5.53 billion. In the full year, net income fell 31 percent, to $577 million, or $4.59 a share, from $802 million, or $6.31 a share, the previous year. Annual sales rose 2 percent, to $17.41 billion from $17.06 billion.
Citing the recession, Penney said its operating profit had declined in the final quarter and the year because of sales and an increase in its inventory accounting charge because of inflation, especially in women's apparel and fine jewelry.
Penney's stock was up 50 cents yesterday, to $53.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
 
May
May Department Stores said its fourth-quarter net income fell 11 percent, to $252 million, or $1.91 a share, from $283 million, or $2 a share, in the 1989 period. The recent quarter had an inventory accounting charge of $17 million against an inventory accounting credit of $34 million in 1989's fourth quarter. Sales rose almost 2 percent, to $3.28 billion from $3.22 billion.
For the full year, May reported almost flat earnings of $500 million, or $3.74 a share, compared with $498 million, or $3.52 a share, for 1989. Sales for the year rose 6 percent, to $10.04 billion from $9.46 billion.
May's stock rose $1.125 yesterday, to $50.625.

HEADLINE: Bottom of the Housing Slump Is Seen in the New York Area

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
The New York area's housing slump may have finally hit bottom, or come close to it.
Lenders say that in the last two months, during what is normally a winter lull, demand increased for mortgage loans. Brokers report a sudden surge in sales contracts and say that more people have been attending open houses in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 
 "This is not a big new wave coming in to buy homes," said Eugene Sherman, chief economist for the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which supplies money to mortgage lenders in the three-state area. "But it looks like the tide is no longer going out."
While brokers are buoyed by the renewed interest, they remain cautious about the near-term prospects.
There are signs that people are showing greater interest in buying homes elsewhere in the country as well. A survey of 300 builders this month by the National Association of Homebuilders found that prospective buyers were visiting new subdivision sites at nearly twice the rate they did at the start of the year.
In the West, "There has been a distinctive turnaround in our sales in February in the San Francisco Bay area and the Seattle area," said Larry Knapp, president of the northwest regional operations for Coldwell Banker.
Brokerage companies in the South also report more closings and dwindling numbers of unsold houses.
In a report to Congress yesterday, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said his agency also saw signs that the nation's real estate slump might be about to turn around, for residential and commercial property.
Falling home prices have combined with declining interest rates to bring housing to its most affordable point since 1977, he said. Already, there is anecdotal if not statistical evidence that home sales are picking up, he said.
In Mercer County, N.J., which includes Princeton and Trenton, the inventory of homes for sale was lower in January than a year earlier, falling to 4,717, from 4,867. "We have passed the bottom," said Richard A. Weidel, president of a Princeton brokerage that bears his name. It reported 223 home sales in January, 30 more than a year earlier.
More than a half-dozen New York City brokerage firms that deal in condominiums and cooperative apartments report increased sales. Among them are the Corcoran Group, which said sales were running 40 percent higher this month than in February 1990, and Brown Harris Stevens, which said its sales more than doubled beginning in January.
 
Mortgage Rates Down
 "The fever has broken," said William Raveis, president of William Raveis Real Estate, a large brokerage in Fairfield County, Conn. He said his company sold 392 homes in January, 100 more than in January 1990.
In Montville, N.J., hopeful buyers began lining up at 4 A.M. on Saturday, Feb. 16, for the opening of a sales office for 78 two-story town-house condominiums priced at $130,000 to $165,000. Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., a large home builder that is offering the condominiums, said purchase agreements were signed for all 78 by the next day.
If the housing market has indeed reached its trough, there is ample cause, economists and analysts say. They point to the sharp decline in mortgage interest rates, now well below 10 percent, and to the even steeper fall in home prices. Those declines have converged to make houses, condominiums and co-ops bargains -- at least compared with the lofty prices of the mid-1980's.
Prices over all are continuing to fall, in fact, as buyers seem to be seeking out the less expensive homes, brokers said.
Chemical Bank, a major mortgage lender in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, said home loan applications jumped 46 percent in January from January 1990, and were up 62 percent from December. In Westchester County, Haber Mortgages Ltd., a broker of loans for 40 banks, said its applications rose 50 percent in January, and are up another 50 percent in February.
Arbor National Mortgage Inc., which is based on Long Island and has lending offices throughout the New York area, said its applications were also up 50 percent in January, and another 50 percent this month.
 
Many Delayed Purchases
 Surveys have found that thousands of New York area residents have been postponing home purchases. And while no one is predicting a return of the go-go 80's, marriage, children, job transfers, retirement and other family needs are persuading some to wait no longer.
In this shifting market, two people who earn their living by keeping a keen eye on the local real estate scene now have something else in common. Both have entered the market to buy homes.
The two, Michael Giliberto, a Wall Street real estate analyst, and Kevin Miller, a New Jersey appraiser, are among a ripple of buyers that has emerged since December.
"Lower interest rates help; reality has finally dawned on sellers, and I need shelter," said Mr. Giliberto, a vice president in the real estate research department of Salomon Brothers, the investment banking firm.
Since moving to New York City from Dallas early in 1989, Mr. Gililberto has rented a Manhattan apartment, saying he did not want to risk buying while prices were falling. But that changed on Feb. 14, he said, when he contracted to buy a house in Larchmont, the suburban Westchester County town. He made his decision in part because he is getting married and in part because he felt the time was right to make a deal.
To be sure, some measures suggest that the New York area market remains deeply mired in the slump. The National Association of Realtors, a trade group in Washington, said the number of home sales fell 14 percent in New York, 16 percent in New Jersey and 13 percent in Connecticut in the fourth quarter of 1990, compared with the comparable period of 1989.
It also said that a similar pattern had emerged in much of the nation. "This was probably the lowest point for the economy and housing we've seen in several years," said John A. Tucillo, the group's economist.
Construction of new homes has plummeted across the Northeast, falling another 30 percent in January, according to the Commerce Department. Inventories of unsold homes remain bloated, and analysts warn that they might expand with the first strong signals of strengthening demand. Many homeowners who wanted to sell but decided not to try in a sagging market might then jump in.
 
Prices Still Sliding
 Home prices show no immediate signs of rebounding after a free fall that has lasted at least two years.
"The sustained slide has been the most severe in the relatively young history of the city's co-op and condominium marketplace," said the Corcoran Group, which surveys sales of expensive Manhattan apartments. It reported a 26 percent price decline between the spring of 1989 and the end of last year, and in January, despite increased activity, it reported another 3 percent slip.
The recent buying spurt could be a fluke. Unusually warm winter weather could be a reason. And house hunters might be experiencing the same surge of consumer confidence that has propelled stock prices since the outbreak of the Persian Gulf war. But now, with the war over, they could retreat from the market as attention shifts to problems in the regional economy and their own household finances.
Still, signs of a strengthening market abound.
In what may signal future demand, HSH Associates, a New Jersey company that publishes information on mortgage rates and terms, said sales of its newsletter soared 300 percent in January, with most of the increase in the New York area. Part of the spate of loan applications and inquiries came from homeowners electing to refinance their mortgages at lower rates. But executives said most of the demand had been from buyers.
"Suddenly, we are inundated," said Hall Wilkie, vice president of Brown Harris, who said it sold 22 apartments in January, compared with only 9 a year earlier. It said sales in the first half of February had already exceeded February 1990.
 
First-Time Buyers Lured
 Industry executives say inexpensive homes -- particularly those within reach of first-time buyers -- have been attracting the bulk of recent demand. And while these purchasers may allow some sellers to move to larger houses, the experts say there is little evidence that demand is "trickling up" to the most expensive homes.
More expensive properties, ranging from two-bedroom condominiums in Manhattan priced at more than $500,000 to large suburban houses priced over $1 million, have experienced the steepest erosion in value, and may not recover for years, according to some forecasts.
"We have simply run out of people who can afford to pay $500,000 for a house," said Michael Aronstein, president of Comstock Partners, a Wall Street money management firm. Since 1988 his company has been predicting a decline in home values, particularly at the high end of the market, that might last until the late 1990's.
Nonetheless, he added that the recent increase in activity among those seeking "shelter for utility" might signal a turn for middle-income residents across the New York area.
 
Planning a Family
 One prospective first-time buyer is Mr. Miller, the New Jersey appraiser, who is 27 years old. Since December, he said, he has looked at 20 houses, hoping to find something for $150,000 or less.
One reason to buy now, he said, is that he and his wife, Kathleen, are planning a family. A more immediate reason, he added, is the drop in interest rates, now below 9 percent on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages offered by some New Jersey lenders.
"Those rates might not last," said Mr. Miller, who two weeks ago bid $139,000 for a house in Hunterdon County that is in need of repair, but was originally priced at $169,000. After second thoughts, he said, he moved on to look at other properties.
For many would-be buyers who already own homes, the question now is less a matter of finding properties they like at a discount, but first selling what they already have. Many fear being saddled with the expense of paying for two homes at once.
Still, some people have concluded that there are enough signs of an increase in potential buyers that they can buy what they want now, and be able sell what they have later.
"I know I am taking a calcuated risk," said Cheryl Burton, a psychiatrist and part-time real estate broker in Westchester County. Last week she signed a contract to buy a house in Greenburgh even though her other house in the same town has been on the market for eight months.
Ms. Burton said she was able to buy the home she wanted for under $300,000 -- 20 percent less than the seller had asked. She plans to close the deal by May, and said her other house "has been attracting a lot more attention from buyers, and will certainly sell by the spring."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: REPARATIONS;
War Damages and Old Debts Could Exhaust Iraq's Assets

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Iraq has very little money to pay war reparations, and had overdue debts to many creditors even before it invaded Kuwait, current and former United States Government officials and other experts say.
The United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on Oct. 29 that made Iraq liable for war damage and losses suffered by Kuwait and other countries. When President Bush specified Wednesday the allies' conditions for a permanent cease-fire, he included Baghdad's "acceptance in principle of Iraq's responsibility to pay compensation for the loss, damage and injury its aggression has caused." 
 Iraq said Wednesday that it would comply with all 12 resolutions.
But forcing Iraq to pay reparations will be difficult, given its lack of money, and will conflict with other American interests, said Richard W. Murphy, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs.
 
Empty Coffers Influence War
 Iraq's near-empty treasury has been a cause of the war and an obstacle to its conclusion.
On Feb. 15, when Iraq first said it would consider negotiating a withdrawal, one condition was the cancellation of its foreign debts and thoseof neighbors who had not assisted the allied war effort.
An eight-year war with Iran ended in 1988 with Iraq virtually bankrupt. "They were in a very tight condition financially, which is why we had the invasion" of Kuwait, Mr. Murphy said.
The scarcity of overseas Iraqi assets has prompted speculation that the only way to raise the money may be to garnish Iraqi oil revenues.
Iraq's debts and potential liabilities dwarf its overseas assets, which were frozen Aug. 6 by the United Nations, said Sharif Ghalib, Director of the Africa and Middle East department of the Institute of International Finance, a Washington-based research group.
Estimates of the frozen assets range from $4 billion to $6 billion. By comparison, Kuwait has said it would seek up to $60 billion in reparations and United States companies are preparing damage claims that could total several billion dollars, said Javade Chaudhri, a partner in international corporate law at Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Washington.
Other countries can also make claims, with the Kuwaitis saying they will seek the return of property looted by Iraqi military forces.
 
Iraq Owes Billions
 Iraq owes $35 billion to Western governments and banks, $11 billion to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and as much as $40 billion to other Arab countries.
Mr. Murphy pointed out that garnishing Iraq's oil revenue would conflict with threats to block its oil exports to force the opening of its nuclear, chemical and biological research sites to international inspection.
Iraq's oil exports are worth about $17 billion a year, assuming a price of $20 a barrel and a return to 1989 production levels of 2.4 million barrels per day, said Fareed S. Mohamedi, an economist at the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington.
Out of those revenues, plus a pittance from date exports, Iraq must service its debt, rebuild its infrastructure, and import several billion dollars in food and foreign parts and equipment.
A state-run Iranian newspaper said yesterday that a Security Council resolution on July 20, 1987, made Iraq liable for reparations from its war with Iran. But the resolution called only for an investigation of the causes of the war.

HEADLINE: Ultimately, Customers Will Bear the Cost

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Bankers said yesterday that the higher deposit insurance premiums they must pay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will be spread without great pain among their customers and shareholders. But they complained that all banks, including the strong, were being required to pay for the problems of the weak.
"Everybody is going to try to pass along the cost to their customers with higher fees, lower interest rates on deposits and higher rates on loans," said Raymond V. O'Brien, chairman of the Emigrant Savings Bank, New York. "We can afford it, but it definitely is going to put a dent in our bottom line." 
 Bank deposit insurance premiums will rise on July 1 to 23 cents per $100 of deposits, nearly double the 12 cents charged a year ago and up from the 19.5 cents that went into effect Jan. 1. The 23-cent premium will raise about $870 million a year for the F.D.I.C.'s Bank Insurance Fund. Banking industry profits last year were estimated at more than $17 billion.
 Under the current system, where insurance premiums are charged only on deposits in domestic offices, the impact is greatest on those banks that rely heavily on domestic deposits and whose earnings are already at a low level.
John W. Spiegel, executive vice president at SunTrust Banks Inc., in Atlanta, said the need for banks to keep profits high enough to attract capital will require that the higher insurance costs be eventually passed on to customers. "Most of the banks in our system were planning for a 19.5 cent premium this year, though some had anticipated it could be higher," he said.
"It is reasonable to expect the banking system to pay for its deposit insurance system" Mr. Spiegel said, "though I think higher-quality banks should pay lower premiums than weaker banks, just like non-smokers pay lower life insurance premiums than smokers."
James W. Kienker, executive vice president at Boatmen's Bancshares, St. Louis, said that collecting the higher deposit insurance premiums from bank customers and shareholders was ultimately not much different from collecting the cost from taxpayers. "Indirectly, all taxpayers are customers of ours or some other deposit-taking institution," he said.
Orin Kramer, a New York consultant to financial companies, said that questions about the health of the banking system were more important than the debate over how to refinance the F.D.I.C.
"The more important question still facing the F.D.I.C.," he said, "is which banks are going to fail and how fast will they be closed."
Because insurance premiums are charged only on deposits in domestic offices, a recent analysis by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods concluded that the higher rates will hurt many banking companies in the economically troubled Northeast and Middle Atlantic States. These banks, the study said, are already financially weak and rely heavily on domestic deposits for their capital.

HEADLINE: Restaurants

BYLINE: By Bryan Miller

 BODY:
"Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner," wrote Lord Byron, alluding to the affinity between romance and gastronomy, which has been celebrated in literature, theater and art over the centuries. When it comes to restaurants, though, the forums for seduction are becoming as rare as gentlemen's duels for a lady's hand. Economics and fashion dictate that restaurants today be big, boisterous and fast paced. Happily, the Sign of the Dove remains an exception.
 Andrew D'Amico, the enterprising chef who has run the kitchen since 1986, continues to refine his fundamentally Provencal menu, which has tributaries from Morocco, Italy and America. There is something for every taste in his repertory, and dishes are as distinctive as they are thoughtfully orchestrated. 
 If there is one area that needs tightening at this restaurant, it is the front desk. Upon entering, you are greeted by a hostess who directs you to the coat room, then dispatches you down a hallway to see the maitre d'hotel. The greeter, however, is nowhere to be found. Men in dark suits scurry up and down the stairs. You try to make wistful eye contact with all of them. No luck. After three or four awkward minutes, I started to feel like a job applicant who had arrived at an inopportune moment. My dinner companions, who arrived later, had the same experience. In all other respects, though, the service staff is well regimented and professional, although the kitchen can be slow.
The Sign of the Dove's main dining rooms, separated by brick arches with wrought-iron filigree, are enchanting with clusters of flowers, skylights, soft indirect lighting and roomy, well-separated tables. Virtually every appetizer can be recommended. One of my favorites was a crunchy pancake of coiled capelli, or angel hair pasta, surrounded by perfectly cooked sweetbreads seasoned with capers, brown butter and port. Sweet little clams came in a peppery broth chunky with potatoes, lean Chinese sausage and watercress. A casserole of lobster meat and oysters in a light shellfish stock, bound with cream and perfumed with fresh fennel, was a paragon of delicacy. A delightful special one evening had a Moroccan flair: shrimp marinated in the chef's variation of chermoula, the Moroccan condiment. His interpretation of it combines paprika, cumin, cayenne, garlic, lemon juice, cilantro and olive oil. The marinated shrimp were grilled and served in a snappy fish broth with butternut squash.
 If you are in the mood to splurge, there is a luxurious little igloo of glistening salmon slices encasing salmon caviar and creme fraiche over a slice of brioche.
 The Sign of the Dove has a wide-reaching wine list with prices that are generally fair. The best selections for the money are found among French, Alsace and Loire labels, as well as American chardonnays, cabernet sauvignons and pinot noirs.
 A unifying strength of this kitchen is the delicacy of the sauces. This can be seen in the pink-cooked medallions of lamb over a light but robustly flavored stock sauce. In the center is a packet of cabbage holding minced lamb sausage, pine nuts, raisins, bulgur and sweet peppers. The same goes for thick, tender veal medallions in a rosemary cream sauce with buttery herbed green noodles on the side.
 Sauces could not salvage an overcooked $36 veal chop (although on a second sampling, it was delicious), nor a rib-eye steak that lacked a beefy punch. A good example of Mr. D'Amico's international approach can be tasted in his roast baby chicken served in a shallow bowl over cumin-perfumed Basmati rice, cardamom-spiced lentils and okra. A solid all-American dish is his grilled Muscovy duck breast, well charred and deliciously smoky, paired with moist little pumpkin pancakes, cranberry chutney and roast pears.
 Seafood is no less enticing. Roasted snapper in a coating of herbs and bread crumbs is excellent in a grainy mustard sauce with (tough) braised endive. Perfectly grilled salmon is set over couscous moistened with a piquant fish broth with chickpeas, carrots and squash.
 Sweets to cap off a flirtatious evening abound. A tropical fruit trifle served in an oversize brandy snifter would be a challenge to share. Blueberry strudel made with sourdough pastry is outstanding, as is the chocolate-dusted mascarpone torte afloat in a pool of mocha sauce. Warm lemon cream tartlet is unbalanced, with too much crust and not enough lemon. Go instead for the terrific coffee granita drizzled with Sambuca cream.
 It's a pleasure to see that the Sign of the Dove continues to fly high. If, indeed, much depends on dinner, there are few equal settings in town.

HEADLINE: Fortunes and Spoils of War

BYLINE: By MICHAEL NORMAN; Michael Norman, the author of "These Good Men," a book about war and comradeship, is an associate professor of journalism at New York University.

DATELINE: WEST POINT, N.Y.

 BODY:
CIVILIZATION'S worst nightmare has always been history's best story.
Here, for example, on a white pedestal in a glass display case is a steel helmet: 1 pound 11 ounces, gray-blue flecked with rust. The helmet was worn by a Frenchman in 1916 during the 10 months of bloody siege at Verdun. By some estimates, 40 million rounds of high explosive artillery were spent by both sides in that battle. By some estimates, nearly 900,000 Germans and Frenchmen were left missing, wounded or dead. 
 One of these surely was the wearer of the blue steel helmet that now sits on the pedestal in the case at the West Point Museum here. The helmet has a hole in the right side, a roughly rectangular opening, one and a quarter inches high and half an inch wide. The edges of the hole curl inward, inarguable evidence that a large piece of high-speed shrapnel punctured the helmet just above the wearer's right ear.
There are other items in the display case -- grenades, barbed wire, long-barreled rifles, a light machine gun -- but it is the blue helmet with its jagged and mortal hole that seems to capture those who pass.
"This guy didn't do too well," said a short woman in a red raincoat, pausing with a companion. "Look, he got a hole in his head. Look at it!"
 War has been everywhere in recent weeks. It has slumped in a seat on the morning bus, it has queued up at the lunch counter, it has held the airwaves late at night. And in every venue there has been an argument. Few on the home frontreally knew exactly where to stand or sit. Dinner parties often turned on "political realities" and "moral imperatives." What began as an innocent chat often ended in an ideological harangue.
Having a sense of history, of course, does little to mediate the arguments or still the discord; the early hours of any war are filled with passion, not perspective. But there is something about a museum -- like the one here in Olmsted Hall, a neo-Gothic, brown-brick building just outside the main gate of the United States Military Academy -- a museum of flintlocks and cannon and bombs, that leaves a visitor strangely serene.
Although the United States Army has been collecting war trophies since the late 18th century, it did not gather them together for public display until 1854. The West Point Museum has 45,000 objects in its collection with some 1,300 on display at one time: weapons, uniforms, flags, portraits. In September 1989, the collection -- described by the director, Michael E. Moss, as the largest diversified military collection open to the public -- was moved to its current site, a building with two main wings behind the Academy's visitors center. Mr. Moss estimates that 300,000 people a year make their way across the museum's terrazzo floors and through its six galleries. "If I had to sum up its message, I suppose it would be that leaders continue to emerge, civilization goes on, time proceeds," he said.
It is hard to say why three floors of martial memorabilia and lethal artifacts have such a calming effect. Perhaps the feeling comes from simply strolling around old annals. The detached past is always a relief from the troubled present. A rusting steel helmet with a hole in it can convey a sense of peace that a newly made coffin does not. Maybe it is simply that a museum is like a blank slate. "People create their own version of history," said Roy Rosenzweig, a historian at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. "An exhibit can mean different things to different people. It is possible to take away different messages."
The West Point Museum, of course, speaks most directly to the patriot. Here, for example, are two portraits of George Washington, one as a colonel in the Virginia Militia -- roughly at the age of 40 -- and the other as commanding general of the Continental Army. In the former he is dark-haired, fresh-faced and eager. In the latter, he is pale, gray and resolute.
 
A British War Prize
 Nearby is a large kettledrum captured from the British Ninth Regiment of Foot, which fell to the Americans at Saratoga in 1777. Kettledrums and the trumpets have long been the musical mainstays of armies. They keep the cadence of march, they herald the advent of battle, they announce the great victory.
"Beat! beat! drums!" wrote Walt Whitman. "Blow! bugles! blow!"
Among the other war trophies, tokens of triumph, is the bejeweled baton that belonged to Hermann Goring, the shrewd air marshal and economic chief of Nazi Germany. Captured by American forces in 1945 and later sentenced at Nuremberg, Goring committed suicide in 1946, the day before he was to be hanged. His baton -- an ivory wand decorated with 20 gold eagles, 640 diamonds and caps of lustrous platinum -- is truly a despot's staff, corrupt and audacious.
Upstairs is a Civil War oil on canvas based on an 1861 woodcut by Thomas Nast. The painting shows a "Grand Parade" of Union troops with flags unfurled, marching up Pennsylvania Avenue in long red-and-blue ranks. It is a stirring scene, so many men, so willing to fight, so ready for self-sacrifice.
 
Oddities of History
 But there is plenty here on display for pacifists as well. On almost every wall and in almost every glass case there is something -- an artifact, a piece of text, a rendering -- that fills the rooms and corridors with a powerful irony.
"Man has engaged in organized war since at least the fourth millennium B.C.," says a wall panel introducing an exhibit on the history of warfare. "Since that time there has been a war of some sort in progress all the time through the present day . . . Unquestionably, war-making is an aspect of human nature which will continue as nations attempt forcibly to impose their will upon others."
A display on ancient battle explains that it was the early Middle Easterners -- Assyrians and Persians -- who developed "the fundamental tactic" of striking quickly and with great force to overwhelm the enemy.
Farther along is a picture of the father of "modern warfare," Gustavus Adolphus, the Swedish king, who, during the Thirty Years' War, organized his army into squadrons and brigades, basic fighting units that endure today. His talent for war, however, did not make the king immune to chance. On Nov. 16, 1632, Gustavus Adolphus was on a battlefield enveloped in fog and he strayed into the fight. His horse, wounded, and no doubt out of control, carried the king headlong into the enemy ranks, where he was brought quickly to the ground and killed with a shot to the head.
 
Napoleonic Artifacts
 Here too are pistols and a gold-and-silver sword that belonged to Napoleon. The panel that explains the Emperor's end seems to foreshadow the battlefield politics -- and expectations -- of a later era: "Two of the most important factors in Napoleon's downfall were the improvement in the ability of the coalition opposing him to act in concert and losses incurred by French armies."
World War I was the first war that really turned on technology: "Organized science was enlisted in direct technical support of military effort. The machines that were most influential were the airplane, the tank, the submarine, and the radio. The introduction of lethal gas also presented a new dimension into warfare."
Finally, near an exit, not far from the blue helmet with the hole in it, is a long white placard that offers some "Reflections."
"Peace," wrote Thucydides, "is an armistice in a war that is continuously going on."
"Only the dead know the end of war," said Plato.
"Nothing is worse than war?" asked Winston Churchill. "Dishonor is worse that war. Slavery is worse than war."
"It is well that war is so terrible," said Robert E. Lee, "we would grow too fond of it."

HEADLINE: Review/Film;
Coming to America, to a Chilly Welcome

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
In "Misplaced," a proud Polish woman and her teen-age son immigrate to the United States for political reasons, and rebuild their lives in an environment that is often less than friendly. Settling with relatives in Virginia, they must contend with economic hardship, lack of suitable job opportunities, loneliness, and the supercilious behavior of those not eager to make them feel welcome in a new land.
Halina Nowak (Elzbieta Czyzewska) quickly finds that her mother and half-sister cannot easily accommodate her in their small suburban house, and that after years of separation the family is less than close. ("I always wanted to bring you over, but the time just went by," says Halina's mother, played by Viveca Lindfors.) Halina and her son, Jacek (John Cameron Mitchell), move to a drab apartment and begin the difficult task of making it a home. Meanwhile, Halina also looks for a job. Though she is an accomplished linguist, she can find nothing better suited to her talents than cleaning work at Voice of America headquarters. 
 The film -- which opens today at the Quad Cinema -- proceeds quietly, and without any more fire than its title suggests, to show how Halina and Jacek gradually put down roots. As directed by Louis Yansen, who makes his feature debut with this semiautobiographical story, it is often attractively sincere. The women's roles, though, are written (by Mr. Yansen and Thomas DeWolfe) as virtual catnip for any actress equipped to convey noble suffering, and both Miss Czyzewska and Miss Lindfors have many opportunities to play this to the hilt.
Miss Lindfors, in one scene, confronts street hooligans and shames them into going away. Miss Czyzewska, in another, corners two selfish yuppie women and shames them into giving her an audition as a Voice of America announcer. "I am just a cleaning woman, is that it?" she shouts, bristling with anger. Together with Miss Lindfors, who is also supposed to be doing work of this kind, they make the two most stately, dignified cleaning women imaginable. That may be Mr. Yansen's point, but it is overworked.
Jacek's section of the story is more easygoing. Mr. Mitchell does extremely well in conveying this high school student's shyness, intelligence and eagerness to fit in. Jacek is as obviously superior to his new surroundings as his mother is, but he is less inclined to say so, even to the teen-age girls who make fun of his loud, low-budget American clothes. Mr. Mitchell's Jacek has enough quiet dash to make those teen-age girls eventually see the error of their ways.
Mr. Yansen's direction is plain and sometimes even blunt, but he succeeds in offering a clear and affecting sense of the Nowaks' ordeal. When Jacek struggles to learn the Gettysburg Address and complains of difficulty with the word "unalienable," his mother erupts with the anger that runs tacitly throughout the story. "A word is too hard?" she cries. "You tell me what is so hard about a word!"

HEADLINE: HORSE RACING;
Gulfstream to Be Host for 1992 Breeders' Cup

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HALLANDALE, Fla., Feb. 28

 BODY:
Gulfstream Park was named the site of the 1992 Breeders' Cup Series today, and for the second time in four years will serve as host for horse racing's day of champions.
The series of seven races, which was first run in 1984, is rotated each autumn among tracks in different parts of the country. It was held at Gulfstream Park in 1989 and at Belmont Park in New York last year. It will be staged on Nov. 2 this year at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., and on Oct. 31 next year at Gulfstream again. It has also been held at Aqueduct in New York and at Santa Anita and Hollywood Park in California. 
 The return to Gulfstream was announced at the track today by James E. Bassett 3d, president of the Breeders' Cup, who said the vote of the board of directors had been unanimous.
 
Reasons Behind Return
 "There were three compelling reasons for bringing it back to Gulfstream, besides the success we had here two years ago," he said. "The weather, the racing facility and the enthusiasm and support of the community in south Florida."
When Gulfstream was host to the cup in 1989 the event drew 51,342 fans, who wagered $12.3 million and shattered Florida's records for attendance and handle. The program closed with a sizzling stretch run in the Breeders' Cup Classic, with Sunday Silence winning over Easy Goer and going on to be named Horse of the Year.
Bertram Firestone, the chairman and owner of Gulfstream Park, and Douglas Donn, the president, said the track was honored to stage what they called "racing's greatest day." The 1989 event was credited with injecting $50 million into the economy of south Florida.
Bassett said the format for the series would not change, "even though some people have been concerned with the TV ratings." He added that the prize money would be reapportioned, starting this year, with a raise to winning owners from 45 percent of the purses to 52 percent.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: WORLD REACTION - EGYPT;
Cairo Counting Victory's Spoils

BYLINE: By Clyde Haberman, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Feb. 28

 BODY:
With the Iraqi Army fully routed, Egypt began looking today to turn its participation in the allied victory into concrete political and economic advantages for itself.
"This crisis has shown that Egypt is indispensible," a senior official said, and the Government seemed intent on making sure that its Western partners and fellow Arab countries appreciated the point and acted on it. 
 President Hosni Mubarak is generally viewed as a big winner in the gulf War, for having supported the United States from the start and for having committed a 40,000-member force that fought well and emerged from the land battle with few casualties.
High on the Cairo's wish list are new security arrangements for the Middle East that would guarantee Egypt's leading role as one of the strongest Arab nations. Egypt also wants its share of the billions that will be spent to rebuild Kuwait.
Kuwaiti officials visiting Cairo last week promised their hosts that they could count on receiving 13 percent of the projected costs, estimated at up to $800 million, for an emergency relief program.
But Egyptian business leaders want a lot more, and they are calling on the Mubarak Government to help them win some of the multi-billion-dollar deals expected when the real reconstruction begins.
"It's a big cake," said Taher el-Sherif, secretary general of the Egyptian Businessmen's Association. "We can have a big piece of it."
 
Long-Term Role in Gulf
 For now, Egypt is insisting that some of its troops remain in the gulf to keep the peace between Iraq and Kuwait and perhaps also along other borders in the region.
They also want the United States and other Western nations to withdraw their forces as quickly as possible, reflecting an undercurrent of suspicion here that these countries, although allies at the moment, may have an agenda of their own for the Middle East that does not take Arab interests to heart.
There are good reasons, diplomats say, for Egypt to want its troops to remain in Kuwait and Iraq. Their presence, it is argued, would be a reminder of Cairo's strategic importance, espcially to oil-wealthy gulf nations.
Next week, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is scheduled to visit Cairo and other Middle Eastern capitals, and it is likely that he will be told that the time has come to deal with the Arab-Israeli conflict.
It is not clear, however, how hard Arab leaders will press the Palestinian case before the Americans, partly because the Palestine Liberation Organization won no friends here by casting its lot with Iraq. Even so, sentiment runs strong that Israel's occupation of Arab lands is as urgent a matter as Iraq's seizure of Kuwait.
Referring to the Palestinian issue, the daily newspaper Al Akhbar warned today that "If it remains unsolved, then 20 Saddams, not one Saddam, will appear, and the region will be marked by instability and coups."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE REACTION - WASHINGTON;
A Special Reason To Celebrate

BYLINE: By Peter T. Kilborn, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28

 BODY:
After the Vietnam War, the Watergate affair and lesser embarrassments that sometimes made the Government look dumb, clumsy or worse, many career public servants have a special reason to celebrate a swift, successful war.
"It was uplifting that we did something right and it worked," said Pat Gurley, a 47-year-old secretary at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation who has worked for the Government for 28 years. 
 Joseph E. Talbot, 50, an economist at the Department of Labor, said: "I certainly felt quite proud watching the President's announcement. Not just because I'm a Federal employee, but because it's good for the country over all."
Mr. Talbot's department is now absorbed in assuring that the reservists among the men and women who went to war get their civilian jobs and keep all their other employment rights.
 
Thinking Positive About Bush
 Top officials are political appointees, and they predictably support the President down the line. But many career workers, who tend to leave their political biases at home, say they, too, are impressed by the Bush Administration's execution of the war.
Jacqueline Storey, a union leader in the American Federation of Government Employees at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission who is a paralegal aide at the agency, said the Administration terrified her co-workers a few months ago in proposing budget-cutting layoffs.
But the agency escaped the layoffs, Ms. Storey said. And now, with the gulf war, she said: "Opinions have changed regarding the President. I think they're more positive now. He let us know every step of the way what was happening. It was like soap opera. He did no more than what he had to do."
Joseph Jackson, a cartographer, said the Bush Administration's regard for his agency, the Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, must have improved in the war because of the agency's own little-heralded contribution.
Normally, the agency develops maps of the United States, but some of Mr. Jackson's colleagues were called upon to help the Defense Mapping Agency with its maps of the gulf region that pilots used in finding Iraqi targets.
Mr. Jackson said the maps "had to be constantly updated because Hussein was constantly changing the topography," digging trenches and building berms. The information was then fed into the computers the pilots used in firing their weapons.
Like many other Federal agencies, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has also faced budgetary threats, in its case proposals to hand its work over to private industry.
"We're coming through that all right," Mr. Jackson said. "I think our value has increased."

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Mother of All Columns

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
If we think hard enough now, and if after the troops come home we just hang on to what we learned, the United States can pluck a surprise bonus from the victory in the gulf: a few fine victories at home.
Oh, how drearily often during the war we got sophomoric lectures from the sob-sisters of journalism, politics and academia (both sexes) about how the war would still leave us with all the domestic problems bedeviling the country: drugs, crime, race, AIDS, S.& L.'s, homelessness, recession, teen-age pregnancy, graffiti, garbage, loud radios and paper cracklers at the movies. 
 The lectures came from the renowned experts who were against the war effort. They tried to paralyze us by warning of tens of thousands of American body bags, and now caution us against trying to get rid of Saddam Hussein lest some of his followers feel humiliated -- today's appeasement catchword.
Americans do not need the condescending lectures. They know the war was fought to eliminate a particularly vicious international serial killer bent on conquering a part of the world critical to us and our friends -- including people who live there. Goal enough. It was reached in 100 hours of ground combat, following brilliant campaigns of political and air bombardment.
 Finding lessons in the victory applicable to struggles at home will infuriate all those experts who were so wrong all along, so let's set to it.
 Education. Nobody can say again that American youngsters are a bunch of unmotivated, unskilled louts. The Persian Gulf war showed that the armed forces have done a far better job of teaching technological skills than has the American school system or American industry. How?
One clue: A year ago, Lee Iacocca told me that if he had the jobs he would hire every retiring armed forces technical instructor. Business owes it to itself to find the jobs. Letting that asset go is like not picking up a pot of gold in the street because your coat does not have a big enough pocket.
Race. The armed forces are more successful at integrating black and white, and promoting both -- the essence of real affirmative action -- than any other part of American society. It's insulting to blacks in the forces to treat them as victims shanghaied by economic deprivation instead of what they are -- particularly bright young people looking for advancement, and going where it can be found.
A first-rate study commission should be appointed to find out what the armed forces do about motivation and reward that can be copied in civilian life. It should be told to report in three weeks, no more!
It should start with Gen. Colin Powell, not only because he was a poor boy, an immigrant's son, who became Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, but because he is a graduate of the great City College of New York and C.C.N.Y. people are smarter than anybody.
Professionalism. Would Stormin' Norman have quit to make more money lecturing if the war had dragged on -- as did our drug czar after 19 months on the job?
 All top appointments needn't come from within the existing bureaucracy -- forfend. But maybe those chosen should have to demonstrate some commitment to a field before they are put in charge of the whole thing.
Taxes. The American public does not argue much about taxes for defense. I am sure we get rooked often, but Americans know they need strong armed forces. Americans realized the gulf war would cost a lot; that was that.
But we hate paying more taxes for education, low-cost housing, medical care for all, and other essentials of democratic society. No use blaming Congress -- not until we voters tell it otherwise.
Clarity. Also known as leadership. Mr. Bush concentrated his energies, clout and passion on getting the war fought and won. Once he got going, Americans had no doubt about that. The reward was the almost universal public support so critical to winning the war.
Mr. Bush also has promised he would be the Education President and would lift the scourge of drugs. Americans see no evidence of either promise keeping him awake by night or concentrating his energies by day. So that is one lesson of the war for Mr. Bush to think about in peacetime, after the parades.
Meantime, don't let Saddam get off -- and THANK YOU AGAIN, MR. PRESIDENT. My thanking him recently for his war leadership upset the doomsday experts who were so wrong all along, and whom it is such a delight to irritate. So this time it's in capitals.

HEADLINE: 'This Aggression Will Not Stand'

 BODY:
Yours is a society which cannot accept 10,000 dead in one battle. -- SADDAM HUSSEIN, July 25, 1990.
This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait. -- GEORGE BUSH, Aug. 6, 1990. 
 Right, and right again. American and allied forces suffered dozens of casualties, not thousands, in winning their lightning victory over Iraq's sadistic blusterer. It's a glowing moment for the soldiers and pilots of many nations, and their plain-spoken commander, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf.
They have earned the admiring gratitude of millions in this and other countries. The skill and coordination of the air war and then of the assaulting armies were as stunning as the speedy outcome.
The credit, however, goes beyond the field commanders. The world that overestimated Saddam Hussein also underestimated George Bush. This page, and others who agreed with the President's goals but thought he was pressing too fast, have to acknowledge that his choices at treacherous junctures proved as successful as they were bold.
Mobilizing the Coalition
Washington was caught by surprise when Iraq devoured Kuwait on Aug. 2. It had until then tried wishfully to placate Saddam Hussein. Mr. Bush immediately reversed course, seizing Iraqi assets, working with Turkey and Syria to close Iraqi pipelines and winning Soviet support for an arms embargo.
With Iraqi tanks poised on Saudi Arabia's frontier, he achieved a pivotal success, organizing a massive army with contingents from Britain, France, Italy, Egypt, Syria and other states.
Uniting the U.N.
All this was possible because Mr. Bush turned simultaneously to the U.N. Security Council for declarations condemning Iraq, imposing an enforceable embargo, calling for the restoration of Kuwait's Government and holding Saddam Hussein accountable.
This gave multilateral sanction to Desert Shield and blunted Iraq's efforts to depict its troops as holy warriors against an imperial America. It also made possible the punishing economic embargo.
Persuading Congress
By October's end, Defense Secretary Cheney startled Congress by suggesting that many more U.S. troops were needed. A few days after the Congression-al elections on Nov. 6, Mr. Bush ordered a doubling of the 150,000 troops already deployed. The timing was politically suspect and the explanation was murky.
The President provoked understandable criticism in Congress -- especially when he appeared to circumvent its war powers by going first to the U.N. for a resolution permitting use of force against Iraq.
In a vital course correction, Mr. Bush sought what some advisers insisted he didn't need: prior approval by Congress for an armed response if Iraq failed to leave Kuwait by the U.N. deadline of Jan. 15.
Saddam Hussein misread the debate as a sign of division and infirmity. More wisely, Mr. Bush recognized it as a source of strength. After a debate notable for reasoned eloquence, Congress gave the President, narrowly in the Senate, authority to wage war. The opposition quickly closed ranks behind the cause.
Unleashing the Air War
Despite fears that Saddam Hussein would strike back savagely with terror weapons, Mr. Bush launched the air offensive seven hours after the Jan. 15 deadline. Within days, flying thousands of missions, coalition warplanes won control of the air. To judge by the evidence so far, the crushing air assault achieved its objectives of demolishing military targets while holding civilian casualties to a remarkable minimum.
And Saddam Hussein failed to alienate Arab states from the coalition with his desperate efforts to draw Israel in. His barbarous Scud attacks on Israeli cities were thwarted by Patriot rockets, urgent U.S. diplomacy and anguished Israeli restraint.
Unleashing the Troops
Faced with last Saturday's deadline for a ground war, Saddam Hussein erred by not agreeing immediately to a Soviet peace bid. Mikhail Gorbachev wanted negotiations -- but not enough to put Soviet-American relations at risk for so incoherent a client. Mr. Bush stood firm, while carefully tending his personal friendship with Mr. Gorbachev.
The American President thus stands as unchallenged winner in an enterprise of high risks and high ideals. With this outcome, he holds a formidably strong hand in seeking support for his peace aims.
Granted, these were extraordinary circumstances. Saddam Hussein's brutality was amply advertised by his use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq war. Then his troops tortured and plundered their way through Kuwait. He spewed oil into the Persian Gulf, made prisoners of foreign nationals and targeted innocent civilians with murderous missiles.
There was every reason for the world to respond collectively and massively. By absorbing Kuwait, Iraq was poised to control two-thirds of the earth's known oil reserves, rake in billions, build a nuclear arsenal and terrorize, at a minimum, its neighbors.
By making himself so universal a threat, Saddam Hussein provoked as universal a response. This was a war that had to be won. That it was won so swiftly and with so few allied casualties is cause for pride, and gratitude.

HEADLINE: Child Poverty Twice as Likely After Family Split, Study Says

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
After their parents separate or divorce, children are almost twice as likely to be living in poverty than they were before the breakup, the Census Bureau said today.
The percentage of children living in poverty jumped to 36 percent from 19 percent in just four months, Federal researchers found.
Only 44 percent of absent fathers were paying child support four months after the breakup, a figure that changed little a year later. Although mothers worked more after a breakup, their efforts did not compensate for the fathers' absence, and family income declined by 37 percent. 
 When adjusted for the drop in family size, the 37 percent decline in family income is actually 26 percent, the study found.
 
Link Between Poverty and Family
 The study, by Suzanne Bianchi and Edith McArthur, was based on data from the bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation and was unrelated to the 1990 population census. Beginning in 1983, the researchers followed 20,000 households for 32 months, interviewing them every four months.
The findings come at a time of increased national concern about child poverty, and several social policy experts said they underscored the link between family structure and economic well-being.
Prof. David Ellwood, a child poverty expert at Harvard, said the research indicated the need for better enforcement of child support awards.
"The greatest source of insecurity in America is growing up in a single-parent home," he said. "We've done very little to see that absent parents do their share."
Professor Ellwood has called for the Government to make the payment itself in the event it fails to collect, to avoid penalizing a child.
 
Poorer Before and After
 Researchers have wondered whether family breakup causes poverty or whether the reverse is also true, that economic difficulties lead to separation and divorce.
The study found both forces at work. Families that experienced a breakup had only 83 percent of the income of those that did not.
"Children who experience a disruption are economically disadvantaged compared to other children, even before the separation occurred," Ms. Bianchi said in a telephone interview.
A similar pattern held true for children whose mothers were single when the study began. Those whose mothers married or reconciled with their husbands were less likely than others to receive food stamps and more likely to receive child support.
In unadjusted terms, the initial income drop of 37 percent declines to 29 percent after 16 months, as women work more, collect more from absent husbands or remarry.
 
Lack of Skills
 Ms. Bianchi said the data suggested that only some women were successful in increasing their amount of work. The percentage of women working full time, for instance, increased over four months to 41 percent from 33 percent four months later, and remained essentially the same after a year.
Similarly, many women who had not been working at all found part-time jobs. The percentage of nonworking women dropped to 31 percent from 43 percent four months later. But this change did not last, and at the end of a year, the figure returned to 43 percent.
Ms. Bianchi said she thinks the numbers show that some women "may not have the skills necessary to get jobs that make it worth working."
Like earlier studies, this one found a large difference in the experiences of blacks and whites. Of the whites, 77 percent remained in two-parent families over the course of the study. For blacks, the figure was 37 percent.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: Israel;
ISRAEL'S LEADERS PUT UNITY ASIDE

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 1

 BODY:
The unifying threat of Iraqi missile attacks just one day behind them, Israel's leaders began breaking ranks today, issuing plans and pronouncements to stake out their positions on peace initiatives as they anticipate the visit next week by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
Even though it is unlikely that Mr. Baker will propose grand new plans or programs during his brief stop to Israeli politicians, his visit is beginning to take on far larger importance. 
 Mr. Baker has never visited Israel. And now many here are seeing his planned trip as a symbol of the shift in the world's attention, from the conflict in the Persian Gulf to the Arab-Israeli conflict and new efforts to solve it.
Sensing the new attention to this nation's role in the region, Shimon Peres, leader of the opposition Labor Party, issued a peace plan published in a Jerusalem city newspaper today. Among its provisions, it calls for a demilitarized West Bank and a unilateral withdrawal from Gaza.
 
'We Have Some Ideas'
 Under the Peres plan, a joint Jordanian-Palestinian negotiating team would choose a new governing structure for the West Bank from a number of options not including an independent Palestinian state.
But if there were already doubts that the out-of-power Labor Party could have much influence on whatever peace process develops, they grew deeper when Avraham Burg, a leader among the party's leftist camp, announced that he and his party colleagues would release their own, counter-Peres peace plan at the start of next week.
Within the Government, Yossi Ben Aharon, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's chief of staff, said "we have some ideas" to move peace initiatives forward. He would not disclose them, though he said he did not think they deserved particularly prominent advance billing.
But he said the Government still stood behind its own initiative calling for elections in the occupied territories. Mr. Shamir proposed that in February 1989, but then scuttled the plan under pressure from farther right-wing members of his Government.
 
Altering Levy's Image
 One of those who applied the pressure was Housing Minister David Levy. He is Foreign Minister now and is trying to alter his image from the "constraints minister" of the past.
Mr. Levy is agitating and protesting that Israel should come up with its own peace plan before the Americans come and try to impose one.
Israel needs to demonstrate that "it is not running away from peace," he said on Thursday. "Israel is the one that has initiated more than one peace proposal. The Arab states bear responsibility for rejecting them one by one."
In the last week, Mr. Levy has been trying to schedule a trip to Washington to meet with Mr. Baker and discuss his ideas. But Mr. Baker will come here first.
 
A Far-Right Proposal
 The chairman of the farthest right-wing party in the Government, Moledet, offered a plan of his own today. Moledet's platform advocates transferring all the Arabs out of the West Bank and Gaza.
The chairman, Yair Sprinzak, demanded today that whatever else Mr. Shamir tells Mr. Baker next week, he should also "make clear that Israel won't agree to hand over to foreign rule any portion of the West Bank of the Golan Heights." He made no mention of the Gaza Strip.
When a "new world order" is worked out for the Middle East, and political and economic reconstruction of the region is well under way, he said, the several hundred thousand Palestinian residents of West Bank and Gaza refugee camps should be "resettled in the Arab states."

HEADLINE: Managua Faults U.S. Bid to Soviets

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
Nicaragua complained today that a Bush Administration request that the Soviet Union cut off military supplies to the Nicaraguan Army was inappropriate.
The protest, made in Managua by a senior aide to President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, reflected a growing rift in the relationship between Washington and Managua over continued control of the army by Sandinista leaders. 
 After Mrs. Chamorro defeated President Daniel Ortega Saavedra in the February 1990 elections, she decided to appoint his brother Humberto as chief of the army to assure a peaceful transition. The Administration reluctantly supported Mrs. Chamorro's decision as it praised her as a democratic force who could revive her country after eight years of civil war.
But United States officials have expressed growing criticism of the relationship over the last two weeks after a reported army effort to smuggle weapons and explosives into Honduras and the assassination of a former contra commander, Enrique Bermudez.
Bernard W. Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, and Valery Nicolayenko, his Soviet counterpart, held a meeting in Madrid today at which the American planned to ask Moscow to cut shipments of spare parts to the army and reduce its aid levels to Cuba as well. American officials say that current Soviet military aid to Nicaragua is small, but that the army's Soviet-supplied helicopters and trucks need the parts to remain operational.
Press reports preceding the meeting have produced unease in Mrs. Chamorro's Government, which is trying to tack a political course that will satisfy both her conservative supporters and leftist Sandinista leaders who can disrupt her economic policies by unleashing labor unrest.
Antonio Ibarra, the Vice Minister of the Presidency, said Mrs. Chamorro and other senior officials believed that Nicaragua was being used as a test case by the State Department to determine Soviet foreign policy intentions at a time when hard-liners are making a comeback in the Kremlin. He compared the Aronson-Nicolayenko talks to "someone talking behind your back to one of your neighbors."
"If the United States would like us to request that aid be cut off, Mr. Aronson should talk directly to us," Mr. Ibarra said. "Third parties should not be intervening in our relations with other countries."
A second senior Nicaraguan official, who reiterated Mr. Ibarra's concerns, said Managua was waiting to make a formal protest through diplomatic channels. Administration officials said they did not wish to respond to the protest through the press.
Managua's protest came at a time when a number of Latin American nations, led by Venezuela, are privately urging Washington to refrain from putting undue pressure on Mrs. Chamorro. They argue that Mrs. Chamorro has no choice but to establish a working relationship with the Sandinistas; otherwise she could face a renewed civil war.
But Administration officials have begun to voice concerns that the Sandinistas are slowly retaking decisive political power. They say they have collected circumstantial evidence from several sources in Nicaragua linking the Feb. 16 assassination of Mr. Bermudez to the army high command.
Only six days later, the Honduran Army captured a banana truck loaded with hidden RPG-7 rocket launchers, rockets, bomb detonators and wire three miles north of the Honduras-Nicaragua border. The driver, a Honduran, confessed on the radio that the weapons had been supplied by Sandinista soldiers and were destined for the Cinchonero Popular Liberation Movement, a Marxist guerrilla group that has attacked American military forces stationed in Honduras.
Senior Nicaraguan officials said that the charge that their army was responsible for the shipment appeared accurate, and that the Government was investigating.

King Broadcasting's TV Asset Sale

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 1

 BODY:
The King Broadcasting Company agreed today to sell its six television stations and 13 cable systems to the Providence Journal Company and its joint-venture partner, Kelso & Company.
No price was disclosed for the television and cable operations, which represent about 85 percent of King Broadcasting. 
 Steven A. Clifford, King's chief executive, said the rest of King's assets, -- six radio stations and a mobile telephone company, would be sold to other buyers.
Last August, Priscilla Bullitt Collins, King's chairwoman, and her sister, Harriet Stimson Bullitt, announced the company was for sale and suggested it might be worth an estimated $650 million. The women, the company's controlling shareholders, also said about $100 million of the proceeds would be used to finance environmental causes.
"During the time the company has been for sale, the economy has not been helpful." Mrs. Collins said.
The company was founded in 1946 by Dorothy Bullitt, the women's mother, who died in 1989 at the age of 97. She was active in company mangement until her death and left most of her estate to the Bullitt Foundation.
The company's six television stations are in Seattle and Spokane, Wash.; Portland, Ore.; Boise and Twin Falls, Idaho, and Honolulu. The cable division has more than 200,000 subscribers in Washington, Idaho, Minnesota and California.
Stephen Hamblett, Providence Journal's chairman and publisher of The Providence Journal newspaper, said, "If we are successful in acquiring King Broadcasting, we will operate King in a manner consistent with the philosophy with which it has been operated by the Bullitts."
Bishop Cheen, a senior analyst at Paul Kagan Associates of Carmel, Calif., said the deal was a good fit because Providence Journal "knows how to run a medium-size market broadcasting operation." He added that Providence Journal was flush with cash and had avoided a large amount of debt.
Providence Journal, a diversified communications company based in Providence, R.I., was founded in 1829.
The company's four television stations are in Tucson, Ariz.; Albuquerque, N.M.; Louisville, Ky., and Charlotte, N.C. It also owns a cable television company, Colony Communications, with more than 500,000 subscribers in New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Florida and California.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Gains on Perception that Slump May End Soon

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened against leading foreign currencies yesterday on the belief that the economy may be on the verge of rebounding, now that the Persian Gulf war is over.
Gold prices rose overseas but were slightly lower in New York, with the March contract dropping 40 cents on the New York Commodity Exchange to close at $367.00 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted gold at $366.50 an ounce, up 50 cents. 
 Traders found cause for optimism in the latest economic reports, reinforcing a perception that the recession will be shallow and brief.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly index of business activity rose to 38.5 percent last month from 37.7 percent in January. Traders also saw a bright spot in the Commerce Department's index of leading economic indicators. The January drop in the index -- of four-tenths of a percent -- was not as bad as some economists had feared.
"There still is this tremendous optimism that the end of the war will give this huge boost to consumer confidence and help the economy rebound," said Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank.
Mr. Johnson described a "bandwagon effect" in the market. Trading was heavy throughout the day. He and other analysts said they thought the economy lacked the stamina to warrant such gains.
"My guess here is that it is a bit overdone," said Andrew Hodge, vice president at Bank Brussels Lambert. Despite their skepticism, analysts conceded that the optimism was infectious.
"Everybody, including myself, has begun to write off a deep recession," he said.
The dollar finished trading in London at its highest level against the German mark and Japanese yen since around Jan. 15, the deadline set by the United Nations Security Council for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
The dollar rose to 134.60 Japanese yen in New York, from a rate late Thursday of 133.025. In Tokyo, the dollar rose 2.30 yen to close at 134.25. Later, in London, it was quoted at 134.50 yen.
The British pound fell to $1.8960 in New York, from $1.9120 late Thursday. In London, the pound fell to $1.8970, from $1.9105 late Thursday.
Against the German currency, the dollar rose to 1.5385 marks from 1.5243.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Thursday prices, included: 1.3355 Swiss francs, up from 1.3248; 5.2415 French francs, up from 5.1890; 1,150.50 Italian lire, up from 1,139.00, and 1.1521 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1498.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Oil Climbs Again on Belief that OPEC Will Cut Output

DATELINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices rallied late yesterday to close modestly higher for a fifth straight session in response to speculation that OPEC would soon take steps to cut production of crude.
"Going into an OPEC meeting, the trend of the market is always higher," said Nauman Barakat, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. "There is considerable talk and perception that there is going to be a material reduction in the output of the cartel, and that would be able to stabilize the market." 
 Crude oil for delivery in April settled at $19.38 a barrel, up 22 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The per-barrel price of oil rose $1.47 for the week, as traders decided that the postwar glut of crude would not be as bad as some had predicted, particularly if the production cuts are achieved at the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries on March 11.
Crude opened lower yesterday. Traders were selling oil to take profits from the week's increases, and oil was also depressed by a report in the French newspaper Le Monde that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was seeking asylum in Algeria. Traders thought Mr. Hussein's departure could prompt the United Nations to lift the international embargo on Iraqi crude.
 
 'It's Oil Either Way'
 "People were realizing Iraq would be coming back into production even if Kuwait wouldn't; it's oil either way," said Philip L. Dodge, an analyst with Dillon, Read & Company.
But the report was disputed by a variety of sources and crude moved into positive ground late in the afternoon.
One analyst suggested that the market was slowly moving ahead as the big futures players -- major oil companies hedging their business against unexpected volatility by trading futures contracts -- bought oil to replenish supplies.
The upward move was hurting smaller players who had sold oil on the theory that the price would fall during the ground war, said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in Hoboken, N.J. Many experts had predicted that the ground war would send prices lower, but prices instead have risen every day since the ground war began last weekend.

HEADLINE: Fed's Stance On the Dollar

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve said yesterday that it did not support the dollar through foreign exchange trading in the three months that ended on Jan. 31 because the conflicting pressures of the Persian Gulf war and the recession held the currency in check.
The Fed, which has the authority to buy and sell dollars to influence the currency's direction, has not intervened in the currency market since April 1990, the longest period of inaction in four years. 
 Over all, the dollar declined by an average of 1 percent against the leading foreign currencies in the quarter, the Fed said in its quarterly foreign exchange report.
"There was relatively little change in the dollar exchange rate," said Sam Y. Cross, executive vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "In these circumstances, we did not feel intervention was called for."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: Saudi Arabia;
After the War, the Saudis Prepare For a New Role Among the Arabs

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, March 1

 BODY:
The military victory over Iraq has considerably strengthened Saudi resolve to play a stronger role in Arab politics as an ally of the West and an opponent of militant governments in the Middle East, senior Saudi officials say.
"The experience of asking the Americans to come over here is viewed by all classes of Saudi society, including the most conservative religious groups, as a wise and courageous move," said a ranking Saudi official who spoke on the condition that his name not be used. 
 "I think this is a watershed in the Middle East, where since the early 50's it has been fashionable to be anti-Western, and where the thought of an alliance with the West was viewed as a sin by wide segments of Arab societies," the official said in a long analysis of Saudi policy in the postwar era.
Saudi officials spoke of a new resolve to be more assertive in Arab politics and said they would not embrace a policy of reconciliation with some of those who sided with Iraq, most particularly King Hussein of Jordan and Yasir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman.
 
Pressing To Keep Embargo
 Among other things, Saudi officials say that unless President Saddam Hussein is removed from power in Iraq, they will block any attempts to lift the economic embargo against Iraq. These officials also say they will encourage Palestinians in the occupied territories and in the gulf region to abandon their attachment to Mr. Arafat as a symbol of the Palestinian movement, and to seek an alternative leadership, probably from the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
One well-informed official in the Saudi foreign policy establishment said if the Palestinians resisted such a change Saudi Arabia would encourage a "step by step" resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict starting with the Syrians instead of the Palestinians.
 
Palestinian Leadership
 "We are now hinting to the Palestinians to come up with a new leadership," the Saudi said. "If they are not ready or willing to do so we can start working on other aspects of the Arab-Israeli conflict like the evacuation of the Golan Heights by Israel in return for a Syrian-Israeli settlement."
Other Saudi officials policy makers also said that future Saudi policy would be based on a continued alliance with the United States, the abandonment of old policies of conciliation and appeasement with neighboring hostile Governments like Yemen and the strengthening of this country's bonds to Egypt and its tactical alliance with Syria.
On Iraq, the officials expressed great confidence that as the dimension of the defeat unfolds in front of the Iraqi people, there is every reason to believe Iraqis will remove President Saddam Hussein from power.
Until this occurs, the senior Saudi officials said, the alliance against Iraq will continue to exert maximum economic pressure, keeping Iraq's oil exporting pipelines to Saudi Arabia and Turkey shut down and banning all oil exports by Iraq and imports of goods other than essentials.
"It is up to the Iraqis to realize that what Saddam Hussein has done to them is disastrous," one Saudi offiial said. "But if we appear to push him out of power by force of arms we would make a martyr out of him."
Another senior official who asked not to be identified said: "The idea is for his leadership to be discredited completely and irrevocably. To do so, he must be seen by his own people and other Arabs as a catastrophe and an utter failure."
Saudi officials also say this country, which is burdened with an enormous budget deficit because of a major increase in war-related and other spending since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, will stop its policy of handing out money to friends or foes to shore up their economies or appease their hostile intent -- a policy that has been the hallmark of Saudi Arabia for 20 years.
One high-ranking Government official who took part in the conversation today said it is estimated that Saudi Arabia has given away about $100 billion since the early seventies when its oil income rose dramatically, adding that such largesse is now over.
"What has been proven is that handouts of money do not make friends," a senior Saudi official said. "We gave tens of millions of dollars to King Hussein and to Arafat and they turned against us. The feeling here now is that there will be no more handouts. This is not only a widespread sentiment among Saudi people but it is shared at the highest level of the leadership."
 
'Sinners' and 'Atheists'
 Saudi officials concede that when they first asked the United States to come to their defense they were worried about a backlash among the most conservative right-wing religious groups in the Kingdom who consider all non-Muslims as "sinners" and "atheists." But they said the shooting of Scud missiles at Saudi Arabia by Iraq has changed those sentiments among the large majority of the Saudi population.
"When the Scuds started to fall over here, even the most antipathetic elements to the West felt that if it were not for Western protection we would have suffered enormously," the ranking official said. "This is a very big change for Saudi Arabia, which has always been timid about the presence of foreigners."
Saudi officials also said they did not look favorably on proposals made earlier to station a pan-Arab military force in the gulf, adding that they would prefer to expand their army and depend on logistical and military support from the United States.
Another major change in this country, various Saudi officials pointed out, is a genuine opposition that has developed here among ordinary Saudis toward Jordanians, Yemenis and Palestinians as a people because of their support of Iraq in the war. "The idea of the mild Saudi has dissolved," said Abdlefattah Nazer, a prominent businessman from Jidda. "I think people here do not not want to help any of those who stood against us."
Mr. Nazer and other businessmen said they would not rehire Yemenis and did not expect the Saudi Government to rescind its decision to suspend privileges to Yemenis working in the Kingdom about four months ago because of Yemeni Government support for Iraq. The Saudi decision led to the departure of more than 800,000 Yemenites from Saudi Arabia.
Many of those who have left have now been replaced with Egyptian expatriate laborers, reflecting the vastly improving ties between Egypt and Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: Purchasers' Index Posts Small Gain

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
According to a survey of purchasing managers, the nation's manufacturing economy remained in a malaise in February, but it did show a slight improvement from January.
The National Association of Purchasing Management said yesterday that its index of economic activity rose to 38.5 percent in February from 37.7 percent in January. That made February the first month since May that the index did not decline. Still, February's reading was the lowest of any in the last 12 months, except for January's. 
 An index below 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is declining, while a reading above 50 indicates expansion. Economists said that despite some improvement, the level of new orders remained extremely weak, an indication that economic troubles would continue.
 
The Pace of Decline
 "These figures indicate that the recession is continuing," said Andrew F. Brimmer, president of Brimmer & Associates and a former governor of the Federal Reserve. "However, they also suggest that the pace of the decline in economic activity is slowing somewhat."
Mr. Brimmer said there was some encouragement in the slight rise in new orders. "But as far as encouragement goes, that is all there is to it," he said. "The numbers do not point to a recovery any time soon."
The purchasing managers' report is considered an important economic indicator because it is based on a survey of managers from a wide range of industrial companies. Each month it is the first important indicator of how the economy performed in the previous month.
 
 A Bit of Optimism

"Although the economy is still in decline, there are encouraging signs in February's report that we may have reached the bottom of the declining trend," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's business survey committee and director of corporate purchasing at Pitney Bowes Inc. "Over all, the light at the end of the tunnel may still be very dim, but it may very well be signaling that the worst is now behind us."
But Joseph McAlinden, director of research with Dillon, Read & Company, said the report indicated that the economy "is not showing much sign of a turn, other than the fact that it seems to be falling at a slower rate." He added, "The index still indicates that there is a decline in the economy."
The purchasing managers' new-orders index registered a rise, to 38.3 percent in February, from 35.7 percent in January. The report suggested that the February figure "might be the bottom of this current economic cycle and the beginning of an upward trend."
 
 A Crucial Component

The level of new orders is the most closely watched component of the survey because the level of orders affects production, prices and other indexes. Production followed the same trend as new orders, rising to 38.1 percent in February, from 37.1 percent in January.
New orders for exports increased, but at a sharply slower pace. The index of new export orders fell to 52 percent, down from 56.5 percent in January. The index of imports increased to 46 percent, from 43 percent in January.
Prices declined sharply in January, falling to their lowest level since December 1982. The purchasing managers' price index dropped to 41.8 percent, from 49.1 percent in January. The association said much of the decline in the price index resulted from lower prices for crude oil. Before February, the index had shown seven consecutive months of price increases, the report said.

HEADLINE: BANK REGULATORS SEEKING TO RELAX ACCOUNTING RULES

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 1

 BODY:
With banks in many regions of the country shying away from making new loans, Federal banking and savings regulators moved to ease that logjam today by recommending a relaxation of the standards used by banks to put a value on their loans.
Specifically, the regulators called for changes in the way banks evaluate commercial and real estate loans that are in trouble. The new accounting standards would enable banks to report greater profits on such loans, providing them with an incentive to extend credit to more borrowers. 
 Many banks and savings and loans are in trouble, mainly because of loans that went sour in a troubled economy. As these troubles mounted, banks and customers started complaining that bank examiners, with the savings and loan fiasco fresh in their minds, were becoming too aggressive in scrutinizing loans. This in turn was said to compound the tightening of credit, particularly in New England, where the economy has quickly eroded.
 
The Goal: Easier Credit
 Officials said the long-awaited measures were intended to counter these complaints and to make it easier for people and businesses to get loans.
"There is an atmosphere of fear in financial institutions out there that they are going to get whacked in the back of the head if they make any loan," said John E. Robson, Deputy Treasury Secretary and the senior Administration official coordinating the regulatory changes. "That is clearly not the atmosphere you want to have."
But critics said today's measures would eventually come back to haunt the industry and the Government because the changes dilute standards at a time when increasing numbers of large banks are failing or reporting lower earnings. They likened the proposal to the decisions in the 1980's to relax standards for savings institutions and to refrain from closing weak institutions.
"It's not as egregious a forbearance standard as the savings and loans, but it mirrors the excesses," said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa and a member of the House Banking Committee. "It conveys the notion that toying with the books is legitimate, and therefore obviates the need for commercial banks either to raise more capital or shrink."
Mr. Leach said the new standards would increase the likelihood of a taxpayer bailout of the Federal program that insures deposits at banks and would also have the effect of deferring "the necessary consolidation of the industry."
The guidelines clarify the way banks put a value on real estate loans and on their financing of transactions made with a large amount of debt. They also call for greater disclosure about loans on which the borrower has stopped paying interest. The changes have been urged by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
The guidelines were issued jointly today by the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
None of the proposals require legislative action, but the most significant one, involving the treatment of non-performing loans, is subject to final approval by the bank regulators and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees accounting standards. That is expected to occur after the 45-day period set aside for comments from accountants and industry representatives.
 
Allowing Some Leeway
 The proposal would allow so-called loan-splitting, in which a troubled loan still paying some interest would be divided into good and bad parts instead of being entirely written off. Existing guidelines require banks to label the entire amount of such loans as "nonperforming," which is the category for loans that are 90 days past due or are so troubled that the bank does not expect full repayment.
As an example of a loan that should not be written off entirely, regulators today cited a homeowner who is delinquent on mortgage payments, but who promises to start making payments after 90 days and then does so. Currently, the bank would have to write off the entire loan but under the changes the bank would be able to recognize the interest payments.
These are some of the other changes and guidelines:
*Banks and savings associations would not have to put a value on real estate in a troubled market, reflecting the depressed price the property would bring if it was sold immediately. Rather, the value put on a house, apartment building or commercial property should reflect its market value over a longer period, which would give the bank the chance to benefit from an upturn in the market.
*The definition of "highly leveraged transactions," which include company buyouts or other broad changes that rely on a large amount of debt, would be loosened so that it would no longer include certain kinds of debt. Bankers and regulators keep track of such transactions to help judge an institution's soundness.
*Weak banks would be encouraged to make loans to "sound borrowers" even though such loans would further dilute the bank's capital level, a formula that is generally viewed as an indicator of a bank's health.
*Financial institutions would be encouraged to provide greater disclosure of the details of their entire loan portfolio.
"We hope that the actions taken today will encourage lenders to make prudent loans and assure that examiners perform their review in a balanced, sensible way," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said, describing the measures as a "sensible approach to the credit crunch."
The pressure on regulators to act swiftly has been apparent for weeks. Senators and representatives from New England have threatened to oppose the Bush Adminstration's proposal to provide more financing for the savings and loan bailout until the Administration addressed the tightening of credit.
 
Quick Action Urged
 In a House Banking subcommittee hearing on Thursday, Representative Joseph P. Kennedy 2d pursued an aggressive line of questioning and urged senior regulators to move quickly, even if it meant circumventing the normal process for changing the rules. Mr. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, suggested that the banks be permitted to ease accounting standards immediately, before the Securities and Exchange Commission formally acted, and then return to the old standards if the agency later objected.
But that idea was quickly rejected by Richard C. Breeden, the chairman of the S.E.C., who said he could not "throw the rules out the window," adding that 'the worst mistake made in the thrift disaster was the move to weaken accounting rules."
On Wednesday, Mr. Breeden said that "there is nothing inherently wrong" with the idea of loan-splitting, but that he wanted the commission to be able to study the concept fully before aprroving it.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo, Security Pacific Soar on Rumors of Merger

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The possibility of a merger between the Security Pacific Corporation of Los Angeles and Wells Fargo & Company of San Francisco sent the shares of both companies sharply higher yesterday.
Officials of both companies, which are the second- and third-largest banks in California, declined to comment on yesterday's rumors about a potential merger or about the increase in their stock price. But the lack of official comment did not stop their stocks from rising steadily on heavy volume. By the close of trading, Security Pacific shares were up $4.125, or 14.8 percent, to $32 each on the New York Stock Exchange, while Wells Fargo stock was up $6.375, or 11 percent, to $76.625. Security Pacific was also the Big Board's third-most-active stock, with 3.9 million shares traded. 
 The merger rumors were taken seriously by traders because Security Pacific executives conceded in late January that they had talked about a merger with Wells Fargo as recently as late 1990. Bankers, Government regulators and investors say they expect a rash of large bank mergers within a year or two.
A combination of Security Pacific and Wells Fargo is widely seen as one example of such a merger that would greatly improve the profits of the two companies as they eliminate duplicated branches, executive positions and back-office operations.
"A merger would make sense economically, but I don't think it will happen in the immediate future," said Donald K. Crowley, a San Francisco-based analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.
A person close to one of the banks, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that talks had not begun again and that there was no timetable set to restart them. But he said both banks still remained interested.
 
 $40 Bid Rumored
 Some analysts said a merger would be more likely to occur as a result of an exchange of shares by both companies for a new company, rather than Wells Fargo offering cash and securities for Security Pacific. One rumor yesterday said that Wells was preparing a $40-a-share bid for Security Pacific.
Michael Murphy, editor of the Overpriced Stock Service, a newsletter, said he told clients yesterday that "the Security Pacific board has decided they want to sell." Based on a conversation with a Los Angeles financier with close ties to the Security Pacific board, Mr. Murphy said that if an offer of $40 a share was made for Security Pacific, "it is a done deal."
The $40-a-share price was also quoted Thursday in a CNBC cable broadcast by Dan Dorfman, the financial columnist.
 
Profits From Streamlining

Ronald Mandle, a banking analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company said in a recent report that a merger of Wells Fargo and Security Pacific could result in $800 million in additional profit for the two companies.
In 1990, Wells earned $711.5 million while Security Pacific earned $161.3 million. Security Pacific's profits were reduced by a $357.6 million loss as it increased reserves for loan losses and incurred large costs from the closing of much of its wholesale corporate lending and securities trading business.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: United Nations;
U.S. Softens Stance at U.N. On Terms for Resuming War

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 1

 BODY:
Under pressure from the Soviet Union and China, the United States abandoned efforts today to have the United Nations Security Council explicitly authorize the anti-Iraq forces to resume hostilities if Iraq fails to comply with President Bush's terms for ending the gulf war, diplomats said tonight.
But an emerging new Council resolution implicitly allows the use of force again if Iraq threatens Kuwait and says that, before the Security Council can "establish the definitive end of hostilities," Iraq must tell the Council it has fully complied with the terms President Bush laid down this week when he announced a suspension of offensive operations. 
 The new draft resolution also expressly reaffirms that Resolution 678, which authorized the allies to expel Iraq from Kuwait by force, remains valid, implying that the allies still have the authority to resort to battle if Iraq threatens Kuwait's independence again.
The original American draft reaffirmed the right of the anti-Iraq coalition to "resume offensive combat operations" if Iraq failed to comply with all President Bush's terms.
 
Language Seen as Too Bellicose
 But diplomats said that China and the Soviet Union, two permanent Council members with a veto on decisions, opposed this language as overly bellicose and that the United States was forced to drop it. The Security Council decided tonight to continue its deliberations on Saturday.
The latest draft affirms that the 12 resolutions the Council already passed on the gulf crisis "continue to have full force and effect."
After noting Iraq's stated willingness to accept these resolutions in full, the latest draft says this means Baghdad must immediately rescind its annexation of Kuwait, accept liability for damage caused by its forces and release prisoners of war, detainees and seized Kuwaiti property.
In this draft, the resolution lifts the international economic sanctions imposed on Kuwait at the time of its annexation. But it maintains them on Iraq.
 
Embargo Goes On -- For Now
 As a result, Iraq will continue to be denied all new supplies for as long as the United States wants, because the embargo can be lifted only by a new Security Council resolution over which Washington has a veto.
But the United States and its allies say they may agree to lift the embargo as part of an agreement under which Baghdad would earmark some of its oil revenues for war reparations.
Some diplomats said the United States would like to see the resolution passed by the time commanders of the two opposing sides meet to discuss military arrangements for the end of hostilities. That meeting, originally fixed for Saturday, was delayed for at least a day because of logistical problems.
While negotiations were in progress, the heads of two United Nations humanitarian organizations appealed to allied forces in the Gulf to give some unused medical supplies to help relieve disease and suffering among Iraqi civilians.
 
Appeal for Medical Supplies
 "We hope that some of the vast mountain of medical supplies the military has built up there could be used for civilians and children," one of the officials, James P. Grant, executive director of Unicef, said at a news conference here today.
Calling for "very, very urgent action," Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, the director general of the World Health Organization, said that while army field hospitals are mainly equipped to deal with battle wounds, the military still has many medical supplies that are now in short supply among civilians in Iraq.
The heads of W.H.O. and Unicef were presenting a report on health conditions in Iraq prepared by a team of doctors and officials from the two agencies who visited Baghdad from Feb. 16 to 21, bringing with them some 54 tons of medical and other humanitarian supplies.
In Washington, Pentagon and State Department spokesmen had no comment on the call for allied medical supplies, but President Bush indicated that the United States might be willing to provide some medical assistance.
 
Military Supplies Suggested
 In answer to a question at a White House press briefing today the President said, "The United States will step up and do what it is -- that which we've always done, lay aside the politics and help the health care requirements, or help the children, especially."
W.H.O. officials said that military field hospitals could provide additional supplies of syringes, sutures and certain medicines.
In addition, they argued that the military forces in the gulf could help with the shortage of small electricity generators and the fuel to run them. The generators have been the only source of electrical power for Iraqi hospitals, laboratories and health centers since the public grid was destroyed.
Stressing the urgent need for fresh medical supplies in Iraq, Dr. Nakajima pointed out that average temperatures are likely to rise sharply in the next few weeks with the coming of spring, increasing the risk of serious outbreaks of cholera, typhoid and meningitis.
 
Food, Water Said Inadequate
 In their report on health conditions in Iraq, the W.H.O.-Unicef team said, Baghdad's water system is providing no more than 15 liters of inadequately treated water per inhabitant each day, compared with the prewar figure of some 500 liters.
Cases of severe diarrhea and respiratory diseases among children are up to four times normal rates, the report says.
The experts calculated that the basic Iraqi food ration now provides only about 1,000 calories a day, or less than half the needs of a five-year-old child. Families can supplement this from the free market. But with supplies scarce and prices high, the report concludes that most people barely receive their daily minimum requirement.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 27.72 Points, to 2,909.90

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Prodded by signs that the economy is mending, stock prices recovered from an early slump and moved ahead briskly yesterday.
The Dow Jones industrial average bounced back from a 27-point slide to close at 2,909.90, up 27.72, or nearly 1 percent. Showing that the advance was widespread, the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index rose at almost the same rate, gaining 3.40 points, to 370.47, a record high. And the Nasdaq 100 index of the top 100 non-financial over-the-counter stocks also reached a record high of 504.78, up 4.55. 
 Reports of new takeover talks between Wells Fargo and Security Pacific and between the failed Bank of New England and several other banks helped most of the banking stocks involved.
Heavy waves of program buying added a total of 26 points to the Dow throughout the day, Birinyi Associates said. One 10-minute flurry just before 11 A.M. accounted for almost all of the gain.
 
Strong Volume Continues

Trading on the New York Stock Exchange continued at a strong 221.5 million shares, down a little from 223 million on Thursday. Advances led declines by 3 to 2.
Seventy-two Big Board stocks reached new highs, including American International Group, the insurer. It jumped 2 3/8, to a new high of 93.
Gains for the week were thin, with the broad list of stocks scoring much better than the blue chips. The Dow edged ahead 20.54 points, three-quarters of a percent, while the S.& P. 500 rose 4.82 points, or a little more than 1 percent.
Traders were watching the Commodity Research Bureau index closely yesterday, sensing that it was giving off the first signals that the economy was strengthening. A brighter economy, they argued, would mean higher profits, and higher profits would lift stock prices.
The commodity index, rising more than 1 percent yesterday, climbed almost 4 percent for the week.
 
 Sign of End of Recession Seen

"That means we're coming out of recession," said Stuart Shinbein, senior technical editor of the research bureau, noting that the commodity index had moved higher all week.
"One of the first signs that we're coming out of recession," he said, "is a rise in commodity prices and a simultaneous decline in bond prices." Bond prices, he noted, had weakened in seven out of the last eight trading sessions, including yesterday's, a good sign that bond traders feel the economy is far too strong for the Fed to lower interest rates much more.
Responding to the weakness in bonds, stock prices slumped early on but moved ahead sharply with the help of heavy program buying. By 11 A.M. the Dow was ahead 40 points from the low, and by 1 P.M. it had climbed more than 50 points from the low.
Short-sellers, who sell borrowed stock hoping to profit from price declines, depressed prices several times but helped lift the market near the end of the day by buying back shares to avoid unforeseen problems with their positions over the weekend.
 
 Gains for Bank Stocks

An article in The Wall Street Journal helped Bank of Boston by reporting that the bank had approached Warren E. Buffett and the Tisch family, both in the billionaire category, about putting money into the company so it could bid for the failed Bank of New England. Mr. Buffett already has a big stake in Wells Fargo. The Tisches have one in the Bank of Boston, but earlier this month they reported selling a part of it. Bank of Boston, No. 9 on the Big Board active list, rose 1 3/8, to 8 3/8, with 2.2 million shares changing hands.
BankAmerica rose 3/4, to 33; Banc One 1 3/8, to 34 3/8, and Core States Financial 1 3/4, to 35. The three are among a number of potential bidders along with Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, the leveraged buyout group.
I.B.M., gaining a strong 2 1/4, to 131, helped several other high-technology stocks. Digital Equipment tacked on 1 1/4, to 73 7/8; Compaq Computer 1 1/8, to 70 3/8, and Hewlett-Packard, which announced more powerful personal computers, 1 1/8, to 47 3/4.

HEADLINE: Child Care In Conflict With a Job

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Diane McCourtney said it made perfect sense to her when she lost her job as an account clerk at Seagate Technology in Minnetonka, Minn., last year because she took off too many days to care for her sick infant.
"James started getting sick all the time right after I went back to work from maternity leave," she said. "In four months, he had colds, the flu, bronchial pneumonia, sinus infections and two cases of pinkeye. My day care person couldn't have him in her house, because it wouldn't have been fair to her kids and the other kids she takes care of. Seagate had every right to terminate me, because they needed someone to work, and I couldn't do it reliably." 
 What angered Ms. McCourtney -- and what she has taken to the courts in an unusual case that women's advocacy groups are closely watching -- was the state's refusal to give her unemployment benefits.
"They say that it's my fault, that I got fired for misconduct and I'm not eligible for unemployment benefits," she said. "I say I didn't have any choice. I had a sick baby, and no one else to take care of him. I couldn't just leave him."
 
Cushion, for Some
 Unemployment benefits are supposed to provide a financial cushion only for people who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. And in the case now awaiting a ruling by the Minnesota Court of Appeals, lawyers for the state argued that legally, Ms. McCourtney's absenteeism was her fault.
"She made a choice, and even though it was a laudable choice, she is not entitled to unemployment benefits because she chose her family interests over her employer's interest," said Steven B. Liss, a special assistant attorney general handling the case for the state. "We've never had a case like this, and there is no provision for what she did in the law. I expect that the issue will ultimately be taken up by the Legislature."
A spokeswoman for Seagate said the company would not comment on the case.
Ms. McCourtney's quandary, the conflict between the demands of a job and a sick infant, is increasingly common. More than half the mothers of children under the age of 1 are now in the work force, and many, if not most, have no backup child care when the baby falls ill and cannot go to his or her usual day care.
"Survey after survey shows that emergency child care is the hardest to find," said Barbara Reisman, executive director of the Child Care Action Campaign, a national advocacy group. "If we care about the future, we have to stop penalizing parents for wanting to be good parents. We need a Federal family leave law, like the one that the President vetoed last year that would protect parents' jobs when they need time off to care for their kids. And we need more employers that try to accommodate their workers' family needs."
In recognition of the problem of caring for sick children, Minnesota last year passed the nation's first law allowing parents to use some of their own paid sick leave to care for sick children. But the law took effect too late to help Ms. McCourtney and, in any case, helps only those workers who have accrued enough sick leave to cover their children's illnesses.
 
11-Year Employee
 Ms. McCourtney had worked at Seagate for 11 years before James was born in September 1989 and was considered an excellent employee. She took 10 weeks off after giving birth, using maternity leave and vacation time. She then returned to work and paid $60 a week for her son to be cared for at the home of a friend, who looked after several children. But the next month, James got sick, and could not go to day care. Unable to find anyone to care for him, Ms. McCourtney stayed home, missing about half her normal work hours from January to April.
"My husband has back problems and couldn't do it, because he couldn't pick James up," said Ms. McCourtney, who is now pregnant with twins and plans to be a day care provider herself after giving birth. "And while we both have family in the area, they're all working, too, so there wasn't anyone who could stay with James. So I contacted all the day care places in the phone books, and there just isn't anything out there for sick kids."
Of the 10 places she sought out, only one took sick infants on a drop-in basis, and even that one could not provide care starting at 6:30 A.M., when her job began. Furthermore, the cost of that service was $11.50 an hour, or $103 a day -- more than double her net pay of $49.66 a day.
Women's advocacy groups say Ms. McCourtney's case is a textbook example of the problems facing working mothers. It is particularly serious, they say, for single mothers with no family nearby or families in which everyone works.
"There are a lot of women out there who lose their jobs because they're absent so much because of on-and-off illnesses," said Donna Lenhoff, legal director of the Women's Legal Defense Fund in Washington. "A few states have legislation that protects their jobs when they have to take time off, but Minnesota and most others don't."
Congress is considering a new family leave bill, like the one President Bush vetoed last year, that would require employers to allow up to 12 weeks unpaid leave for workers who are ill or who need time off to care for a family member. The House held hearings on the bill this week.
There is no uniform Federal law regarding unemployment benefits for women who have lost their jobs because of family obligations. In several states, Ms. Lenhoff said, women have received unemployment benefits after they took time off to care for a family member and then found their jobs filled when they were ready to work again. Other states, however, deny unemployment benefits in such situations.
 
Few Pursue Appeals
 While the issue comes up with some regularity, Ms. Lenhoff and others said, the McCourtney case is unusual in that few women who are denied benefits pursue an appeal.
"The basic theory is that you can get unemployment as long as you left your job for 'just cause,' not misconduct," Ms. Lenhoff said. "But these cases raise the question of exactly what family-related things are considered 'just cause.' And there is no clear answer on that because unemployment varies so much from state to state."
Currently, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Maine, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Wisconsin have laws requiring employers to provide unpaid leave to workers with sick children, and Washington State provides leave when the child is terminally ill. Several other states allow state workers to take such leave but have no provision covering private companies.
"You can't leave a sick baby alone," Ms. McCourtney said. "And when they're crying and miserable, that's when they most need someone who loves them. The worst part of this was that everybody at work understood and said I was doing the right thing, and then they turned around and fought my getting unemployment."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: Jordan;
Jordan King Asks 'Forgiveness' Among Arabs

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, March 1

 BODY:
King Hussein began an effort today to repair the diplomatic and economic damage his country suffered through its support of Iraq in the Persian Gulf war, calling for forgiveness among Arabs and saying there should be no "gloating and apportioning blame."
In a somber television address to the nation, the King seemed to plead with hostile Arabs and the West not to exclude his small, poor kingdom from the effort to devise a new regional order, which he said should be based on forgiveness, democracy and resolution of the Palestinian issue. 
 Throughout the address, he made no direct reference to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Significantly, when he spoke of the rights of Palestinians to be represented in a peace process, he omitted all mention of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
More than half of Jordan's people are of Palestinian descent, and its people strongly supported President Hussein, who portrayed himself as a champion of Arab and Palestinian rights.
 
Castigated U.S. Allies
 As the war unfolded, the King tilted more and more toward Iraq's depiction of the conflict as a Western attack against the Arab world and castigated Arabs who sided with the coalition led by the United States. In return, the Arab allies -- particularly Saudi Arabia, Jordan's most important financial sponsor -- severed oil supplies and financial support.
"You know that after Iraq and Kuwait, Jordan suffered most from this crisis," the King said.
Apparently In an appeal to Arab nations that sided with the victors in the war, he said: "Gloating and apportioning blame are not Arab traits, nor are they compatible with their spritual values because they lead to enmity, hatred and alienation. On the other hand, forgiveness and burying the past lead to healing the wounds and closing the ranks of the nation once again."
"Let us turn over a new page, thanking God that the gulf war has ended, the bleeding has stopped and that the people of Kuwait enjoy their independence once again," he said. In his last, major speech on Feb. 6, the King did not refer directly to the occupation of Kuwait.
 
'Stand by the Iraqi People'
 "We all bear a responsibility towards Iraq, its heritage and history," he said, urging reconciliation between Baghdad and Kuwait. "We shall stand by the Iraqi people as they look forward to rebuilding their country and to healing their wounds."
"Today is a day for reflection and self-appraisal, to heal the wounds, restore Arab unity and lay solid foundations for a better future," he said.
"On this day," he said, "we urge the world again to address the question of Palestine by the same criteria that it has applied over the question of Kuwait. We should also like to renew our pledge to the world that we are committed to striving for the attainment of a just and durable peace that guarantees the national rights of the Palestinian people on their national soil."
"Foremost among these rights is their right to self-determination and to representation in a peace process aimed at resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict," he said.
He ended his speech with Koranic verse saying: "It may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and it may also be that you prefer a thing and it may be the worst for you. God knows all, and you know not." The same verse was cited by the Iraqi President in a speech as the allied victory approached.

HEADLINE: Salary Fame Is Fleeting And Henderson Is Angry

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 1

 BODY:
Fact A: When baseball players began cracking the $3 million barrier in November 1989, Rickey Henderson spent three days as one of the two highest-paid players (with Kirby Puckett).
 Fact B: Fifteen months later, Henderson is tied with five others for 36th. 
 Fact C: Henderson continued to be a no-show at the Oakland Athletics' spring training camp today.
 Given Facts A and B, Fact C should come as no surprise to anyone who knows Henderson.
"You know Rickey," Richie Bry, Henderson's agent, said today by telephone from St. Louis. "Rickey has expressed his feelings about the contract, which by any standards is outdated. He's not happy about it and I'm sure they know that."
 
Numerous Complaints
 Henderson is not the only player unhappy about his salary for 1991. Ryne Sandberg of the Chicago Cubs is not pleased with the Cubs' offer for a contract extension he is seeking to elevate his economic status. Ramon Martinez, a 20-game winner last year, has rejected the Los Angeles Dodgers' contract offers and has not reported to camp. Jay Howell, the Dodgers' top relief pitcher, indicated his displeasure with a $1.05 million salary in the last year of a three-year contract by missing the first four days of training. And Rob Dibble, Cincinnati's uninhibited reliever, has threatened to leave camp over a contract dispute.
Joe Magrane, on the other hand, is happy with his salary ($1.025 million), which more than tripled his 1990 pay, but the St. Louis Cardinals' No. 1 starter is very unhappy nonetheless. He learned today that he would miss the entire season because of an elbow injury. Magrane, who is scheduled to have surgery April 1, hurt his left elbow Feb. 16 when he was throwing on his own before the start of spring training.
Magrane's impending surgery was described by the Cardinals as similar to that undergone in recent seasons by the St. Louis pitchers Ken Dayley, John Tudor, Danny Cox, Greg Mathews and Todd Worrell. Worrell is the only one of the five still on the Cardinals' roster.
 No one other than Henderson knows when his spring training will start. The Athletics' first full-squad workout was Wednesday, and he hasn't been sighted. Under terms of the collective bargaining agreement, players don't have to work out until March 6.
 
Counting on Henderson
 "I don't let the owners' executive board or the Players Association set my priorities," Tony La Russa, manager of the A's, said in the Scottsdale Community College gym, where rain forced his players to work out. "What's March 6? That doesn't mean anything to me. What's important is the team's feeling, and Rickey is part of the team. We need him here."
 Henderson, the American League's most valuable player last season, knows how to take care of himself, La Russa added. "He's playing for the Hall of Fame so he's going to be fine," the manager said. But once he makes his statement, he has to be here for the team. Rickey's status in the game -- m.v.p., the best leadoff batter in history -- has nothing to do with what he makes. He has to understand that. At some point, his absence becomes a concern. The point is not today."
 Bry and Sandy Alderson, the Athletics' general manager, have discussed Henderson's contract several times, most recently last Tuesday.
 "I don't know if anything will be worked out," Bry said. "It depends on the A's and their feeling of fairness toward him. If they can give him something, he can give them something in return."
 Bry was talking about adding years to the three years left on the four-year, $12 million contract. Alderson, who has negotiated the highest payroll in baseball history (about $36 million), didn't sound eager to grant the extension.
 
Try to Be Equitable
 "We have sort of a conflict of principles," he said, walking quickly to his car in the rain. "We don't renegotiate contracts, and I define renegotiation as giving away something for nothing. That's principle No. 1. Principle No. 2 is never say never. We try to be equitable."
 The dilemma, he went on, is "we have a lot of players in Rickey's situation, players who are underpaid by March 1991 standards."
"If we were to address all the players, we'd go bankrupt," he said. "The problem in baseball today is people are never happy. They're constantly in a state of turmoil."
 The Athletics don't know what state -- or city -- Henderson is in now.

HEADLINE: A Consumer Who Uses Shopping to Try to Alter Many Corporate Policies

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
Consumer advocacy has its personal limits, and three years ago Alice Tepper Marlin found one of hers. Her daughter insisted on eating Skippy brand peanut butter. But Ms. Tepper Marlin's book, "Shopping for a Better World" said that Skippy was a politically incorrect choice.
"At that time Skippy was still doing business in South Africa," said Ms. Tepper Marlin. "We rated Jif higher, but my daughter won't eat it." 
 Skippy's corporate parent, CPC International no longer does business in South Africa. Her daughter's peanut butter obsession has waned. But Ms. Tepper Marlin remains committed to changing the behavior of companies by using pocketbook politics.
As a result, she has also helped to spawn an era of what might be called socially conscious shopping. The ethos of the book (Ballantine, $5.95), of which Ms. Tepper Marlin is an author, is now mirrored in a rash of books. And corporate America has taken notice, wrapping itself in the "green" marketing movement, a development Ms. Tepper Marlin views with both excitement and unease.
Ms. Tepper Marlin, an animated 46-year-old with a wide, easy smile, said, "We are concerned to the degree that it has remained a public-relations issue, and how little change has taken place in the marketplace."
Not everyone is fond of Ms. Tepper Marlin, particularly corporations that have run afoul of her relentess and ever-widening campaigns. "We really don't have any comment, but thanks for calling," said a spokeswoman for Abbott Laboratories , which Ms. Tepper Marlin's book rates as cheap toward charities, insensitive about promoting women and intransigent about South Africa.
Married to an economist with whom she adopted two Korean children, Ms. Tepper Marlin has long tried to intertwine capitalism and social activism. In 1968, while a securities analyst, she was asked by a synagogue to help it invest in companies with no interests in the Vietnam War.
That and other experiences showed her that managers of such alternative funds need a source of reliable corporate data. The result was the Council on Economic Priorities, founded in 1969 by Ms. Tepper Marlin. Interests for the center, which is located in lower Manhattan, today focuses on not only information on corporate policies, but also on Federal military spending.
Last year, Ms. Tepper Marlin and her husband, Dr. John Tepper Marlin (who took his wife's maiden name as his middle name), traveled to the Soviet Union for a conference on converting United States and Soviet military plants to peaceful uses.
 
800,000 Copies of Book Sold
 But Ms. Tepper Marlin's biggest clout has come from "Shopping for a Better World," which in three years has sold more than 800,000 copies. "The rating of companies is a reality of life and we have no problem with her ratings because they are fair and objective," said Neil Nyberg, a spokesman for Kellogg Company, which received one of the book's highest ratings in the 1991 edition.
The book started as an effort to help interested shoppers buy products from companies that performed best in such as areas as the environment and charitable giving. Recently, it has added other categories like animal testing. Companies are downgraded for landing on the wrong side of public controversies, applauded if they provide day care.
"We are trying to get people to look at their entire shopping basket," Ms. Tepper Marlin said. "It is not a matter of looking at just one issue or just one company."
The book seems a bewildering array of symbols, and does not consider the quality of products. But its social messages are clearly reaching some shoppers and many businesses.
Just this week, for example, officials of Church & Dwight Company (very good on animal testing, but weak on promotions for women, according to the book) called Ms. Tepper Marlin's group to set up a meeting to discuss ratings for the company, which makes household products like detergents.
 
Oreos and Cigarettes
 But Ms. Tepper Marlin's nit-picking is not just with Fortune 500 companies. She claims some credit for getting Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc. to phase out Oreo cookies as an ingredient in its ice cream. The reason: Oreos are made by one of her arch-enemies, RJR Nabisco , a purveyor not only of cookies but also of cigarettes.
"I will not buy anything made by a cigarette company," Ms. Tepper Marlin said. Rob Michalak, a spokesman for Ben & Jerry's, said he could not comment on Ms. Tepper Marlin's specific impact.
Ms. Tepper Marlin is also using other vehicles to push corporations to change. Last year, for instance, she played a pivotal role in the creation of Green Seal Inc., a public-interest group which plans to award a seal of approval to products deemed environmentally sound.
This whirlwind of activity seems to suit Ms. Tepper Marlin. When her children, now 13 and 16 years old, leave home in a few years Ms. Tepper Marlin sees not more time to relax, but more time to work.
"When my kids go to college," she said, "I'd like to return to being more of a workaholic."

HEADLINE: Disarming the Gulf

 BODY:
At his magnificent Wednesday briefing signaling the end of the war, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf was asked whether Iraq would rise again to threaten the Persian Gulf. No, replied the allied commander -- not unless "someone chooses to rearm them."
At this moment of weary relief, that seems unthinkable. But weapons have a way of finding their way to the Middle East, to a host of clients, including Iraq. Years of indiscriminate arms sales helped cause this war. Unless checked, arms peddling could cause other wars. 
 The sellers are as culpable as the buyers. Real restraint, and a durable regional peace, will thus require a collective effort by the U.S., the Soviet Union and President Bush's coalition partners to curb their own commercial instincts.
The gulf states have been buying weapons at an astonishing rate. From 1982 to 1989 Saudi Arabia and Iraq made nearly a third of all arms purchases by third world countries, reports Richard Grimmett of the Congressional Research Service. The Saudis bought $44.2 billion and the Iraqis, $42.8 billion. Iran ranked fourth, with $17.0 billion, and Syria fifth, with $15.6 billion.
The sellers were mainly the Soviet Union, the U.S., France and Britain. Though by all rights the gulf war should serve as a severe cautionary tale, these same countries may be tempted to sell more arms in the future.
Why? For one thing, the end of the cold war means that defense spending and military aid will decline. That will spur arms makers to promote foreign sales in order to keep production lines open and spread the cost per weapon.
Meanwhile, recession and reduced aid are forcing states outside the Middle East to cut back. In 1989 sales to the third world dropped by 25 percent, to $29.3 billion. U.S. sales fell 14 percent, to $7.7 billion; Soviet sales declined more steeply, by 21 percent, to $11.2 billion.
Finally, arms sellers face keener competition from Eastern Europeans, who are desperate to export anything they can, and from relative newcomers like Israel, Brazil and South Korea. Curbing deadly commercial traffic in this political and economic environment won't be easy. But there are ways worth trying.
Encourage Openness. Arms sales often go unreported. The United Nations has a useful response: register them. A registry would make it easier to keep track of sales and focus attention on suspected but unreported ones. The coalition could go further and establish an international clearinghouse to share intelligence on arms trafficking and target suspect "front" companies.
Resume Arms Talks. Soviet cooperation is essential. In May 1977 Moscow responded favorably to a U.S. invitation to talks on conventional arms transfers. The talks foundered when the U.S. insisted on excluding sales to the Middle East. These talks could be restarted and expanded to include France, Britain, China and other major suppliers.
Concentrate on Sales of Advanced Weapons. Technological change fuels arms races. A key to stability is to focus curbs on the sale of the most advanced arms of all sorts, not just nuclear and chemical.
Use Aid as an Incentive. Economic aid to Eastern European and third world arms sellers could be used to induce restraint and convert arms factories to civilian production.
Mr. Bush suggested yesterday that while he did not wish to thwart the legitimate security interests of individual nations, he would seek an end to unrestrained arms "proliferation." Old habits die hard. But unless Mr. Bush moves decisively to change them, he'll be hard pressed to realize his dream of a new world order.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Victims Of War

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Even as U.S. forces, at George Bush's command, raced to victory in the desert, Ron Brown, the Democratic national chairman, was whistling past the graveyard.
 "The fact that the war appears to be ending quickly and decisively helps us get back to a domestic agenda," he said. "And getting back to a domestic agenda is helpful to Democrats." 
 Well, maybe, if anything can be. Polls do show that Americans tend to give Mr. Bush low to middling marks on domestic policy but that their appreciation of him goes up sharply at the water's edge.
 A year ago, for instance, just after his quick hit on Panama and the Communist collapse in Eastern Europe, in a New York Times/CBS News poll Mr. Bush rated 73 percent approval for his handling of foreign policy and 76 percent approval for his work overall. This, despite the fact that on such home-front subjects as environmental protection, education and taxes, from 63 to 84 percent of respondents disapproved of his Presidency.
 Now, after a startling plunge in his poll standing last fall, Mr. Bush is back in the statistical stratosphere, with better than 80 percent backing in most surveys. The smashing military victory in the Middle East, not the concurrent recession at home, obviously has most impressed the public.
 The consensus among economic analysts, moreover, is that the briefer the war, the shorter the recession. The proof of that will be in the pudding; but that the slump might be over before the 1992 election starts is not the least reason why Ron Brown and his party have little cause for optimism.
 Even if the Democrats can campaign against recession, moreover, as well as such other domestic problems as a failing education system, high crime rates, a dubious drug war, a crumbling infrastructure and the savings and loan scandal, their Presidential candidate, if they can find one, will almost surely be a decided underdog next year.
 The most important reason is that the war against Iraq has given Mr. Bush the aura of a strong leader -- and more than that, a victorious leader, one who pursued his chosen course boldly and with considerable skill. Mr. Bush, in effect, has won his title in battle; and it will be difficult for any challenger to match that incalculable asset.
 Military victory probably also has silenced the Republican right wing, which before Desert Storm was restive at Mr. Bush's reversal of himself on taxes and his suspect devotion to the conservative cause. Less will be heard, from now on, about the possibility of a divisive intraparty challenge from the likes of Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson or Pete du Pont.
 Nor will the Democrats easily find a candidate sufficiently equipped to take on the winner of the desert war. The emphasis on foreign and military affairs hurt all governors, who are perceived to have little experience in these fields, and the quick victory probably damaged those -- like Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia -- who opposed the war. Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee, who voted for and supported it, will still be out-warred by the President, who actually commanded Desert Storm; so Mr. Gore, too, probably would have to emphasize domestic issues.
 It seems to me, however, that Americans now count on their Presidents to be strong and effective in foreign affairs, to act as their chief gladiator in a tough world, but that they no longer expect or believe that any President can accomplish much in the tangled underbrush of domestic matters.
 Abroad, Americans can see themselves as the good guys vs. the bad, with the President their champion -- a sort of political Rocky Balboa. But at home, things are clearly more complicated, by conflicting geographic and other interests, private and public sectors, legal and constitutional barriers, Federal-state problems, racial divisions, party politics -- to name only a few.
 Given this domestic snarl, the more a President tries to do, the more he tends to provoke opposition; the less he attempts, the fewer enemies he makes. As long as a President provides strong leadership in the world, however, a laundry list of domestic accomplishments is neither necessary nor expected; and an active domestic policy may even increase his opposition.
 Even while losing to President Bush, of course, the Democrats might expand their representation in Congress, and perhaps add some governors. Those are the folks from whom the public seems to expect good schools, less crime, better roads, more services -- and the ones they mostly blame when they don't get the things they want.

HEADLINE: For Yugoslavia, Breakup Is Best Answer

 BODY:
To the Editor:
News reports reflecting the Bush Administration position may lead some to the conclusion that the unity of Yugoslavia needs to be preserved at all costs. Several arguments speak to the contrary. 
 The issue of a federal Yugoslavia versus a confederal Yugoslavia, as put forward by Serbia and Croatia, respectively, is of an academic, but not a substantive nature. Had Serbia truly abided by the federal principles, many of today's problems could have been avoided. Instead, federalism died in Yugoslavia in the early 1980's after Serbia dismantled the autonomy of Kosovo province and declared martial law against ethnic Albanians.
Nor did Serbia's actions tame further ethnic passions; rather, they exacerbated nationalist demands in other parts of Yugoslavia. A parallel could be drawn with certain Soviet republics that, threatened by federal authority, automatically increased their claims for more autonomy.
Given the already high proportion of Serbs in the diplomatic corps and the army, Serbian insistence on the preservation of federal Yugoslavia will continue to be seen as a fig leaf for Serbian supremacy. Part of the problem lies in the decades of intransigence by the Yugoslav federal leadership to accommodate the initially modest demands of Croats, Albanians and Slovenes for a more equitable ethnic representation on the federal level. It would be unwarranted to assume that Croats or Slovenes have been bent on seceding from Yugoslavia all along.
The often-heard argument among Western observers, including State Department officials, that independent Croatia or Slovenia would have no economic basis for survival as independent states misses the essential point. Rather than wondering whether Croatia and Slovenia can survive alone, one needs to ponder whether any Yugoslavia can continue to exist as a single state.
A serious commitment on the part of all republics to restructuring Yugoslavia along confederal lines had, until recently, a chance of success. Today this option is no longer possible. Each confederation plan presupposes friendly relations among its ethnic constituents, not armed threats against one another. With all Yugoslav republics having voted Communism out of power -- with the single exception of Communist Serbia -- one wonders what is the point in keeping Yugoslavia together? The timely dissolution of Yugoslavia now appears the only solution to civil war.
Those who placed high hopes in the Yugoslav experiment need to realize that the peaceful departure of its feuding peoples is far preferable to the violent imposition of military rule and the subjugation of one republic by another.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
President's Retirement Bringing Shift at Nucor

BYLINE: By DANIEL F. CUFF

 BODY:
The Nucor Corporation, a leader in an efficient new steel technology, announced a shuffling of its management yesterday under F. Kenneth Iverson, chairman and chief executive.
The new lineup puts John D. Correnti, 43 years old, in the posts of president and chief operating officer; Samuel Siegel, 61, becomes vice chairman and continues as chief financial officer, and Terry S. Lisenby becomes vice president and corporate controller. 
 Mr. Iverson said yesterday from Nucor headquarters in Charlotte, N.C., that the changes, effective June 30, had been brought about with the planned retirement of H. David Aycock, 61, as president and chief operating officer. "He's been with the company and its predecessor for 32 years, and he'd like to do something else," Mr. Iverson said.
Mr. Iverson has led the successful steel mini-mill company since 1984 and backed its bet on a new technology. After a long break-in period, that technology, called thin slab casting, is beginning to produce high-quality steel cheaper and faster than traditional methods.
Mr. Iverson, 65, who has been with the company since 1962, said he had no plans to step down. "I enjoy my job," he said. "My health is good. You should know when the time is right to leave." But he added, "The mandatory retirement age here is 95."
Mr. Iverson said Mr. Correnti had not been designated as his successor at this point. "I don't like the heir-apparent thing," he said. "He'd be one of the three top executives."
Mr. Correnti has been with Nucor, the nation's 10th-largest steel company, for 11 years. He is now vice president and general manager of Nucor-Yamato Steel Company in Blytheville, Ark., a Nucor joint venture with a Japanese concern.
Mr. Correnti has previously been general manager of Nucor's steel division, based in Plymouth, Utah, and general manager of the Vulcraft division, in Brigham City, Utah. "He's a civil engineer who came to us from U.S. Steel," Mr. Iverson said. "He was the youngest man at U.S. Steel ever made a superintendent of construction."
Nucor's new steelmaking process, which is gaining worldwide attention from steel industry executives, is operating in the company's mill in Crawfordsville, Ind., and is still working out imperfections after a two-year start-up. Nucor is counting on the technology to buttress its no-layoff policy and to continue its string of profitable quarters, which it hopes to keep up through the current recession, Mr. Iverson said.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Forecast Predicts Years Of Budget Gaps

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
Even if the broad budget cuts proposed recently by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo are adopted in full, state spending will outpace revenues in the coming years, the Cuomo administration predicted in a report released yesterday.
 The report, the administration's five-year forecast, sketches a gloomy picture of the state's finances through the middle of the decade. Over the next few years, it suggests, additional spending cuts or new taxes will be needed to maintain a balanced budget. 
Future budget action will be required to bring spending growth in line with a slower rate of revenue growth," the report says.
 The Cuomo administration predicts that the state will emerge from its recession at the start of next year. But even with a recovery, it says, growth in tax revenues will not be enough to support growth in spending.
 Over the next five years, it predicts particularly large spending increases for Medicaid, foster care and education of handicapped children.
 
Deep Cuts to Balance
 The budget that the Governor has proposed for the fiscal year starting April 1 calls for deep cuts in state programs, including aid to education, Medicaid and grants to local goverment. If these cuts are adopted by the Legislature, the budget will be in balance through next year, the administration predicted yesterday.
 By 1993, however, substantial budget gaps will develop, it said. By 1995, the gap could grow to almost $2 billion.
 If anything, the administration's five-year forecasts have usually proven overly optimistic. Last year, for example, the administration predicted that the state would face a $1 billion gap this year; it has turned out to be almost $6 billion, according to Cuomo administration estimates.
 Some financial analysts said yesterday that they believed the administration was once again being too optimistic. "We are predicting slower economic growth," said Charles Brecher, director of research for the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses.
 He noted that the spending growth predicted by the administration was, at least in part, a function of its own policies. "That's all controllable," he said.

HEADLINE: Desert Storm and Then What? A Reader's Guide

BYLINE: By Fouad Ajami; Fouad Ajami is a professor of Middle Eastern studies at the School of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University and the author of "The Arab Predicament."

 BODY:
After Operation Desert Storm there will be an American imperium in the Middle East and we shall be healers. Such is the promise of what will come to pass when the guns fall silent. This is a return to an old theme. Pick up the American trail in Iraq and Kuwait and trace it back from today's expedition to the first American ventures into the Arab and Muslim realms. The themes recur, the history telescopes easily. Always there is the promise that over the horizon -- two or three camel days away, as the Arabs of the desert would have once put it -- there will be bliss: the distant power giving something of its innocence and optimism to a region burdened by its feuds and obsessions. And always there is the response of that world: dependence and resentment, attraction to the power from afar and the need to cover up the attraction and the dependence.
Americans don't know the realms of Islam with any great intimacy and authority. The United States has been an unsteady presence in that region: bursts of intense activism alternating with periods of benign neglect. We have tended to think of Arab and Muslim societies as places that the Europeans knew and understood. We stand in awe of the great craft of the British writers and travelers, of the curiosity that took Richard Burton, T. E. Lawrence, Gertrude Bell, Freya Stark and Wilfred Thesiger deep into the lives of strangers. But there is not much in the diplomatic record to sustain a presumption that the Europeans divined the Muslim world and its wellsprings with any great wisdom or precision, or that the conduct of European imperial affairs was made any wiser by the books and the travelers. For its part, the United States will have to learn more about that world under the gun, as it were. There is no assurance that our texts will serve us any better than Europe's texts served her in the Muslim domains, or that we will walk away from this expedition with the sense that we have come to know that world as it really is. 
 What follows is a guide -- one reader's guide, inevitably a bit arbitrary as all such guides are -- to recent books about the Middle East. It includes works of historical narrative and political analysis, and a few works of fiction as well. Though the novel is of recent vintage in Arab realms, a younger generation of writers has taken to it. In the novel they have found the perfect medium for exploring political and cultural material declared off-limits by the custodians of order and orthodoxy.
We should begin to read where Saddam Hussein and those among the Arabs who have rallied to his banner usually begin their historical narrative: the demise of the Ottoman Empire, the making of the modern Arab world in the aftermath of World War I. David Fromkin's splendid and ambitious book, "A Peace to End All Peace," is a reliable guide through that thicket. Mr. Fromkin takes us back to the late 19th century, when the Islamic realms in Asia were viewed in the West as Europe's old, ruined neighborhood. He then reconstructs the schemes unleashed on that feeble neighborhood. His tale is one of great men, their large deeds and even larger follies. In the Arab version of this narrative the tale is told as some sort of passion play, one large story of greed and betrayal. Mr. Fromkin tells it in terms of hubris and incompetence. British hegemony was established in the region in the aftermath of the war. But the tide had gone out on empire. There was little treasure left in Britain to sustain the new domain. Britons ruled behind a facade of native rulers, but they did so, in Mr. Fromkin's words, "with no great sense of direction or conviction."
This is where Arabs might begin a historical narrative of their condition. But inevitably they journey back in time. Their great deeds and achievements are in the past; hence the journey. Historical memory -- selective as all national memories are, playing tricks with the mind -- recalls a time when the Arab/Muslim empire that began in western Arabia extended all the way to Spain. "A History of the Arab Peoples" by the distinguished scholar Albert Hourani is a work of synthesis that pulls together the history of the Arabs from the rise of Islam in the seventh century down to the present day. It is a meticulous book, depicting the growth of a dominant cultural tradition that ran through the Arab realms of Islam and gave them structure and unity.
"Something was stable" in that world, Mr. Hourani writes. A family from southern Arabia could move into Spain and still find itself at home. The Arabic language "could open the door to office and influence throughout that world." A body of knowledge "preserved a moral community" even as rulers rose and fell and power shifted from one city to another. Mr. Hourani depicts the ways of Islam, the culture of its ulema (men of religion) and its courts, the world of the philosophers, the growth of a "chain of great cities running from one end of the world of Islam to the other" and the order of rulers and merchants that governed these cities. He then takes that world through its political shifts of fortune. Mr. Hourani's eye is for order, for the way societies elaborate and refine it. He looks into the abyss of today's Arab politics, to be sure. But it is an older world, with its grace and manners, that holds him. With Mr. Hourani as a teacher we can summon the distant world of Cordoba, or Beirut before its fall. Different guides have to take us through the pandemonium of the present, some through a leap of the imagination.
A young and gifted Lebanese novelist working in France, Amin Maalouf, takes us into that Arab present in an allegorical work of fiction, "Leo Africanus." Set partly in Granada during the final years of Arab rule in Andalusia in the late 15th century, it is a dazzling tale of pending exile and ruin. Granada is made to carry much of the contemporary Arab reality. "This city," a character in the novel laments, "is protected by those who seek to despoil it, and governed by those who are its enemies. Soon . . . we shall have to take refuge beyond the sea." The Sultan of Granada finds a way out of the city's trouble, or so he thinks; he declares war against the Castilians. We know how that tale turned out. The Castilians won, and the people of Granada, both Muslim and Jewish, took to the road. But they took to their places of exile the keys to their houses in Granada; they lived on the hope that "thanks to the Great Sultan or to Providence, they will find their house once again, with the colour of its stones, the smell of its garden, the water of its fountain, all intact, unaltered, just as it has been in their dreams." The reference here is clearly to the Palestinians.
Memory and remorse: they are also the material of Anton Shammas' "Arabesques," a nearly magical novel written in Hebrew by an Israeli Arab born in the Christian village of Fassuta in the Galilee. Mr. Shammas himself is a year younger than the state of Israel. Part autobiography, part the collective memory of three generations of the Shammas family, "Arabesques" has Fassuta's melodic voice and Fassuta's way of telling a story -- meandering in and out of the plot, hinting at things known but not explicitly said, alternating between cunning wisdom and fantastic legend. Of the people of Fassuta a man from a neighboring village observes: "Their luck is good, these Christians from Fassuta. They've always hunkered down at the end of the road, where the warrior comes to rest." Lucky Fassuta that it did hunker down in 1948. Four decades later, it was blessed again by a native son who took its legends, its defeat and its stubborn survival, and fashioned out of it all an enchanting tale. "Rahat Phalasteen. Palestine is lost and will never return," the narrator says. In "Arabesques" we get as close as we are ever likely to get to that vanished world. Beyond blame and apologetics, Mr. Shammas depicts the lives of ordinary men and women caught up in large events. In one of the novel's most memorable scenes, the villagers of Fassuta break into a folk dance, a wild Galilean dabkeh as their village falls to Jewish soldiers. A thin layer of dust rises, and "as is the way of all dust, it did not distinguish between the conquering soldier and the conquered villager."
Nostalgia of a different kind -- less convincing in my view -- animates "Cities of Salt." Written by Abdelrahman Munif, the novel is the work of a Jordanian of Saudi origin. Set in an unnamed principality of the Persian Gulf, it spans three decades: from the arrival of American oilmen in the 1930's to the 1960's. Mr. Munif's themes are political through and through. Though cruel, the desert was home. "What is there in this dry desert besides dust, sand and starvation?" The American prospectors arrive. The peace of the desert world is broken. It ends badly, that encounter between the desert world and the foreign world that intrudes upon it. Something of the desert world is rendered by Mr. Munif. Though his characters are cutouts and his politics at times heavy-handed, Mr. Munif's sprawling novel provides a window to the world of the Gulf Arabs, and to the sensibility of the Arab nationalists of his generation.
In "Republic of Fear: The Inside Story of Saddam's Iraq" by Samir al-Khalil, we turn from the world of the imagination to that of fact and of history, racing past the pieties of Arab nationalism and its pamphlets. In a more benign era, Arab nationalism was an affair of the intellectuals. The Baath Party, which gave us Saddam Hussein, was founded in the 1940's by two French-educated pamphleteers. Three decades later the Baath hatched a monster. Thanks to Samir al-Khalil (the pseudonym of an Iraqi expatriate and historian) we have a superb account of the manner in which Mr. Hussein and his apparatus of terror took an entire society apart and reconstituted it. From its inception in the 1920's, Iraq was an unwieldy realm, a land of divided communities. The Baath conspirators who seized power in 1968 came to stay. Theirs has been a methodical regime that, as the Arabs would say, devoured the green and the dry. The country had become heavily urbanized, hence easier to monitor than the older agricultural society. The centralized economy has shored up the role of the despot. It is a large prison and, as Mr. Khalil shows, Mr. Hussein has been a skilled warden. In this sort of enterprise the master structures the universe. Men believe everything and nothing. From the evidence of this book, it is easy to see the frightened polity doing the master's bidding, bowing to avoid his wrath, prosecuting his war.
Published a year before Mr. Hussein overran Kuwait, "Republic of Fear" is principally a discourse on the ideological foundations of the Iraqi state. Readers in search of a brisk and authoritative narrative of the guns of August 1990 should turn to "Saddam Hussein and the Crisis in the Gulf" by Judith Miller of The New York Times, and Laurie Mylroie, a Harvard researcher. Though an "instant" book, it is compelling to read. Both the events that led up to Mr. Hussein's heist of Kuwait and the more distant background of Iraq's bid for primacy are handled with skill and care. The best part of the book covers the special relationship between Washington and Saddam Hussein. "We knew he was an S.O.B., but he was our S.O.B.," a former official of the Reagan Administration recalls, echoing Franklin Roosevelt's comment in the 1930's about the Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza. In Washington's view of things, Mr. Hussein was the region's gendarme. The result was an American policy that was "a curious blend of cynicism and naivete," a policy that did not discourage Mr. Hussein from making his bid for dominion over the Gulf. In Ms. Miller and Ms. Mylroie's book we have a sustained analysis of this cruel and audacious action.
"The Rape of Kuwait" by Jean P. Sasson is another instant book on the crisis. And it shows. It is a serviceable volume of a particular genre. Ms. Sasson, an American hospital administrator who lived in Saudi Arabia from 1978 to 1990, sought out Kuwaiti refugees in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Britain and the United States. She recorded their stories of heartbreak and strung the interviews together. "This was a book about people and not about politics," she writes. Fair enough. There are some excursions into Kuwaiti history, clearly the work of an amateur historian, that are better skipped. Stick to the interviews. The testimonies of the Kuwaitis supply further evidence that the Iraqi regime had all along seen Kuwait as one large oil well.
It was only in 1946 that the Emir of Kuwait turned a silver valve wheel on a loading pipe and started the flow of oil that transformed the hitherto impoverished principality of pearl divers and fishermen into an object of envy. Those who love big books can glimpse the lands of the Arabian Peninsula and the Persian Gulf, Kuwait included, some six decades ago, as the scramble for oil began, in "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power" by Daniel Yergin. Mr. Yergin, an authority on the oil industry, ranges over the far-flung effects of the black gold. In the Peninsula and the Gulf, Mr. Yergin tells us, the early history of oil was, in good measure, a chronicle of the deeds of Frank Holmes. A New Zealand-born mining engineer whom the Arabs nicknamed Abu al-Naft (the father of oil), Holmes was a restless man who sold the rulers of the Gulf a vision of bliss and abundant oil. An oil find in Bahrain in 1930 vindicated the faith of Abu al-Naft. "It was a stab to my heart when I observed the oil work at Bahrain and nothing here," the Emir of Kuwait complained to Frank Holmes.
The discovery of oil in Bahrain clinched matters for the great desert warrior of the Arabian Peninsula, Ibn Saud. Desperate for funds, he opened his realm to the oil companies. Some 15 years after Ibn Saud took the plunge, President Harry S. Truman would write to him: "No threat to your Kingdom could occur which would not be a matter of immediate concern to the United States." From Truman's pledge to Operation Desert Storm: it is not that long a journey.
There is no way of knowing whether the Arabs would have fared brilliantly had they looked their troubles squarely in the eye. But the Arabs looked away. For there was always that great alibi of modern Arab politics: Israel and the Palestinians. Yet despite this obsession, it has been hard for the Arabs to produce works on Palestinian matters that depart from the received history. Revisionism, an honest look back, is apparently easier for the victors. The defeated have wars to fight and scores to settle.
That is why it is younger Israelis who have gone back to that fight between Arab and Jew and returned with some bold new stories to tell. The best revisionist book may be "The Politics of Partition: King Abdullah, The Zionists and Palestine 1921-1951" by Avi Shlaim, the Alastair Buchan Reader in International Relations at the University of Oxford. Mr. Shlaim's is a magisterial accomplishment: he re-examined the play of Zionists, Palestinians and, across the Jordan River, the Hashemite dynasty, producing an intricate portrait of the old diplomacy. Mr. Shlaim did not set out to rehabilitate the reputation of the Hashemite king Abdullah (King Hussein's grandfather); quite the contrary, perhaps. But the tale itself exonerates the man. Abdullah was the product of an old world, of court politics. He knew that the Jewish claim in Palestine could not be denied. Seeking the possible and a sly, saving bargain, he accepted the partition of Palestine and paid for it with his life; in 1951 he was struck down by a Palestinian assassin. I was 6 and growing up in Lebanon when Abdullah was murdered. My generation of Arabs inherited the view of the Jordanian monarch peddled by his Arab nationalist detractors. Reading Mr. Shlaim's book -- in effect, sitting in on those long sessions that brought together the Zionist emissaries and the Hashemite ruler -- one yearns for the saving ways of the old diplomacy.
The same spirit of revisionism and curiosity about Israel's past is at work in "The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949" by Benny Morris. Mr. Morris's is a book of extraordinary power and integrity, written by a young Israeli scholar and journalist. He takes that great tale of flight and tells it as it has never been told before: with precision and moral economy, with awesome detail. In Benny Morris this episode has its first chronicler and historian.
Did they flee or were they expelled, these 600,000 to 700,000 Palestinian refugees? Those who love their history unambiguous have been sure. But there is no simple verdict in the spectacle Mr. Morris re-creates. It was a terrible time of war and panic. The seams in mixed Arab-Jewish towns came apart. There were cases of flight and cases of expulsion. The Palestinian social structure collapsed. The well off were the first to flee. A "psychosis of flight" seized Palestinian towns and villages. "Flight proved infectious," Mr. Morris writes. Expulsions and border clearings came later, after lines of battle (and hearts) hardened.
The founders of Israel did their work. It fell to the sons, heirs to the triumph and its burdens, to rethink the legacy of the founders. That great tension between the two generations is the theme of Meron Benvenisti's remarkable book "Conflicts and Contradictions." A former deputy mayor of Jerusalem, born in that city to a family whose roots there go back to the 16th century, Mr. Benvenisti is the son of a distinguished geographer, a map maker who, says Mr. Benvenisti, devoted his life to creating a new Hebrew map of Israel. "The Hebrew map of Israel constitutes one stratum in my consciousness, underlaid by another stratum of the previous Arab map," he writes. "I can't help but reflect on the irony that my father . . . imprinted in my memory, along with the new names, the names he wished to eradicate." This is a stunning book that charts with clarity and passion and in distinguished prose the intimate enmity between Israeli and Palestinian. Two maps clashed. A war decided the issue. "We knew that had they won they would have destroyed our work. But we won. . . . Who is the victim? Who is the culprit? Who is the judge?"
In this tangled landscape and in the lives of Arabs and Israelis there appeared, a decade ago, The New York Times's correspondent Thomas L. Friedman, a gifted outsider with an eye for detail and a rare ability to tell a story. Clear-eyed and knowing, he has written a book, "From Beirut to Jerusalem," based on his reportage from the two cities, that is sure to stand the test of time and to rank with the very best of what the great travelers and outsiders have produced about this region. Mr. Friedman went to the Middle East with an all-American sensibility. A child of a Jewish family from Minneapolis, he arrived in Beirut in 1979; he left Jerusalem a decade later. He came to a region in the throes of great changes. Beirut, the celebrated Arab city, the essential city of traders and middlemen, unraveled before his eyes. A Palestinian presence of great pretense -- Kalashnikovs and swagger -- self-destructed. Modernity peeled off. Mr. Friedman caught on to what was happening in record time. Beirut was a "city with a false bottom." It lived a lie. Outsiders came and went. But the malady of the place eluded them. Mr. Friedman was there as the Israelis and the Americans strutted in and then walked out. He was there as well when Yasser Arafat and his men departed from Beirut in the summer of 1982, passing off their departure as a great legend of heroism and resistance. He chronicled it all, with anecdotes and vignettes that bear his unmistakable signature.
Five years after he arrived in Beirut, Mr. Friedman packed his suitcases and golf clubs for his passage to Israel. In Beirut, he had lived on a fault line between Christian and Muslim. In Jerusalem, he of course found another fault line, that between Israeli and Palestinian. It took him a while to find it, "to penetrate the forest of right angles and to discover the jagged and volcanic fault line that lurked just beneath the surface of Israeli society." His incredible luck, the curious outsider's luck, stayed with him. By 1987, he was busy at work reporting on the Palestinian intifada.
There was a time, we know, in the early 1980's, when the past came calling on the Muslim realms. It suddenly pronounced on contemporary matters with newly found stridency and authority. Fittingly, it swept from the east, conjured up by a turbaned savior from Qum, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The region had had its fling with modernity, with the glamour of the foreigner, and now came the revenge of tradition and of nativism. It was hard to interpret this phenomenon of Islamic activism. We saw it like some desert wind sweeping societies back to the past. But it was not so simple. The revolt of Islam was a revolt of a thousand discontents. So many of the Muslim rebels had the outside world under their skin.
In fact, Muslims have reinvented their tradition as they have gone along. (Men and women adopt the ancestors they need.) "A revised or reconstructed past is never the same as the past as it was," the historian Bernard Lewis writes in "The Political Language of Islam." Taking us through the three principal languages of the Islamic tradition -- Arabic, Persian and Turkish -- the most outstanding Orientalist working today demonstrates that even the very language of the radical Islamicists "owes an unacknowledged debt to the westernizers and secularists of the past century and their foreign sources, as well as to prophetic and classical Islam."
But the high walls of Muslim homes kept us out. That is what those high walls are for in that world, after all. One exquisite book, a notable exception to the way the new Islamic politics was interpreted, is that of the gifted Harvard historian Roy Mottahedeh. In "The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran," a study as subtle as the society it depicts, Mr. Mottahedeh finds at the heart of Persian culture a pervasive love of ambiguity that gives that culture a "flexible exterior and a private interior." It was precisely that ambiguity that the clerics were determined to snuff out as "something no longer tenable, a freedom that history no longer permits." The genius of Mr. Mottahedeh's book is its remarkable device: the life history of a colleague of the author's, a young mullah by the name of Ali Hashemi (a pseudonym), born in the early 1940's. The large narrative of Iran's history is woven around Ali Hashemi's life. It is through him that we see Iran's mosques and bazaars, the coming of the revolution and then the disillusionment with the reign of terror.
Ambiguity there was aplenty in the Middle Eastern realms. But despots and modernizers and zealots of every stripe have been on the loose, trying to straighten out the crooked alleyways of that tormented place. That old neighborhood has been remade. Millennial passions and new machines have transformed it beyond recognition. One does not have to be unduly old or unduly nostalgic to grieve both for what was lost and what has risen in its place.

IN THE ABSENCE OF ANGELS
A Hollywood Family's Courageous Story.
By Elizabeth Glaser and Laura Palmer.
Illustrated. 318 pp. New York:
G. P. Putnam's Sons. $21.95. 
 Newspapers in 1985 were filled with stories about the plight of Ryan White in Kokomo, Ind., and the three Ray brothers in Arcadia, Fla. -- all hemophiliacs who, having been infected with the AIDS virus by blood transfusions, had been ostracized and barred from their schools.
At just this time in Los Angeles, 4-year-old Ariel Glaser, whose father, Paul, portrayed Starsky in the popular television series "Starsky and Hutch," began experiencing severe stomach pains. Eight months later Ariel was diagnosed as having AIDS.
The trail led to Ariel's birth and her mother's transfusion with infected blood. Ariel had gotten AIDS from breast-feeding. Tests soon confirmed that her baby brother, Jake, was also HIV-positive. Paul Glaser remained uninfected.
Elizabeth Glaser's life had always been materially comfortable, and surrounded by family and friends. But as soon as she sought counseling for Ariel, she discovered that no child psychiatrist would take the case. Mrs. Glaser was well aware of the stigma of AIDS and of how the Whites and Rays were being treated. She knew that while contracting a fatal illness is awful enough, the ignorance and fear surrounding AIDS could make her family's life unbearable. So, to protect their children, the Glasers erected a wall of secrecy.
As Ariel's health deteriorated, Mrs. Glaser focused her energies on enriching the child's life. But by 1988 Ariel's condition was desperate. "In the Absence of Angels" is Mrs. Glaser's story of what she did for her children when her back was to the wall. She has written, with the help of the journalist Laura Palmer, an absorbing and poignant memoir.
Elizabeth Glaser explains that when her doctors had no solutions, she awakened suddenly to the reality that "there was no one waiting to make everything all right for us. I had convinced myself that at some moment when our lives seemed utterly hopeless an angel would suddenly appear to set everything right. Well, there weren't going to be any angels of that kind. If anything was going to be done, I was the one who would have to do it."
She went to Washington to do research on AIDS at the National Institutes of Health and quickly learned that neither the progress of the disease nor treatment for children was part of the AIDS agenda. She also discovered that people in power were willing to listen to her story. She was able to mobilize legislators like Senators Orrin Hatch and Howard Metzenbaum; they co-sponsored a fund-raising benefit in Washington for Mrs. Glaser's fledgling Pediatric AIDS Foundation.
With the help of her friends Susie Zeegen and Susan De Laurentis, she created the foundation to raise money for basic research. No one had yet asked why some fetuses contracted AIDS from their mothers while others did not, or why AIDS attacked the central nervous systems of children more traumatically than those of adults. The foundation also supported additional clinical tests for the medication AZT, which was prescribed for adults years before it was given to children.
"In the Absence of Angels" is a handbook on how the connected make waves in America. Thousands of people had been unable to call attention to the needs of their children. But the combination of the Glasers' Hollywood contacts and the California network of Ronald and Nancy Reagan enabled her to meet, while in Washington, with the Reagans, George and Barbara Bush and, as the campaign of 1988 rolled on, with Kitty Dukakis.
Although Mrs. Glaser seldom mentions her own precarious health -- focusing instead on her delight and anguish in the company of her dying yet buoyant daughter and irrepressible, still asymptomatic son -- death hovers near. She describes the strains the disease put on her marriage, revealing how each partner dealt privately with grief.
Elizabeth Glaser says that she is not religious, yet she believes in the transcendence of the spirit, and in a series of quasi-mystical experiences she extends her hand to her dead child.
The Glasers bear no grudges against the anonymous blood donor who infected them, or against the inert medical bureaucracy. But they are furious at the National Enquirer, which forced them to go public in 1989 to pre-empt a distorted disclosure of their private agony.
With the wall of secrecy gone, the Glasers found their community loving and supportive. In the few years since AIDS has become a national scourge, their city has been generous to the larger group of AIDS patients.
Mrs. Glaser's heroic reaction to personal tragedy has been remarkable. She has channeled her considerable energies toward working not only for her own family, but for the thousands of other families whose access to power is limited. "When I have met with people in power it's usually because they think I am one of them," Mrs. Glaser writes. "In terms of color and economics, yes, I look the same, but . . . my goals are not their goals. They want to protect what is theirs. They want a kinder and gentler America for them, but not necessarily for others. My family needs an America that is kinder and gentler to all."
Despite the book's title, the Glasers' story is filled with angels -- warm, generous, energetic and imaginative people who listened and helped. This is why Elizabeth Glaser's story, despite its sadness, is upbeat and inspirational.

CITY OF QUARTZ
Excavating the Future in Los Angeles.
By Mike Davis.
Photographs by Robert Morrow.
462 pp. New York:
Verso. $24.95. 
 The most impassioned dinner table argument I ever heard happened long ago near Washington, at the home of a writer for Life magazine with a very promising career. The writer soon slumped in shock as the chief opponents -- his father-in-law, an eminent New Mexico scientist, and his bureau chief, Richard B. Stolley, now editorial director for Time Inc.'s many magazines -- mixed it up. The subject of this vehement debate was, perhaps not surprisingly, the worth of Los Angeles.
Mr. Stolley, who had spent years in Los Angeles, insisted on the city's wonderful qualities, while the writer's father-in-law argued that it was an unforgivable bane on the face of the earth.
The mere mention of Los Angeles often has that result. Mike Davis calls it "the city that American intellectuals love to hate." "City of Quartz" has already attracted attention from intellectuals and others -- favorably quoted in The Los Angeles Times and nominated for a National Book Critics Circle award. Such attention is not surprising. As Mr. Davis says, there is little of substance written about the place.
In his presentation, Mr. Davis attempts the historical equivalent of film noir. He offers a dark, almost unrelievedly oppressive picture of life in a tough, hardhearted city where the ruling elite crushes the poor, whites exploit people of color, public space is turned into fortresses, police abuse the citizenry, and traffic, pollution and urban decay conquer all. "City of Quartz" is the nonfiction equivalent of the novels of Nathanael West at his most somber. Not for Mr. Davis are the idyllic scenes of fruit trees and mountains painted on California orange crates or of Gidget at a late-night surf party. Rather, he depicts an "ecology of evil," of "Armed Response" signs on Westside lawns, of beaches "closed at dark, patrolled by helicopter gunships."
It's all a bit much. Mr. Davis spends so much energy attacking the big guys that it's small wonder that he has not spent more time understanding the ordinary folks.
The author makes little mention of the climate, scenery, economic zest and diversity that have made Los Angeles what he calls "the fastest growing metropolis in the advanced industrial world." The millions of newcomers to Los Angeles didn't go there for nothing and, having found a place that seems as close to livable as possible in this world, most feel no compelling desire to leave. Many are even glad that they moved there.
As in the case of other large cities such as New York, many Angelenos believe that the world revolves around their hometown. Their aspirations and viewpoints are often remarkably provincial. Although Mr. Davis, who teaches urban theory at the Southern California Institute of Architecture, obviously knows more of the world than California, his powerful vision is sometimes dimmed by the same provincialism. He often writes as if he did not know that the problems of crime, pollution, racism and poverty characterize every large American city and, indeed, cities elsewhere. He sometimes writes as if Los Angeles, sheltered by the ocean, mountains and desert, existed alone.
Los Angeles is Mr. Davis's ideal whipping boy for all the sins of capitalism. "The ultimate world-historical significance -- and oddity -- of Los Angeles," he writes, "is that it has come to play the double role of utopia and dystopia for advanced capitalism." He leaves the description of utopia to others; the task he sets himself is revealing the city as the darkest dystopia. The stark, striking photographs of Robert Morrow help the reader understand Mr. Davis's portrayal.
It is difficult to pinpoint the unifying theme for the major topics Mr. Davis has chosen. He hops around -- from a history of the development of the area under men such as Harrison Gray Otis and his son-in-law, Harry Chandler, to an excellent account of homeowners' success in passing "slow-growth" laws; from a chronicle of real estate development to descriptions of "Fortress L.A.," as the rich pull up their drawbridges; from an enlightening tale of the city's criminal gangs and the police department to stories about the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which, because of its huge membership, ethnic mix and political clout, is, he says, "perhaps the most fascinating institution in Southern California." This book is, perhaps inevitably, somewhat narrow in its focus, with insufficient attention paid to the region's millions of blue-collar workers, to the social position of women or to the city's large gay and lesbian communities.
Mr. Davis is, however, particularly worth reading on the ethnic groups in a city whose leadership has been split in recent decades between old-stock American business and banking moguls downtown and Westside Jewish potentates from the movie and building industries. Both groups are increasingly aware of the growing majority, which comprises Latinos, Asians and blacks. "The most WASPish of big cities in 1960, Los Angeles now contains more polyethnic diversity than New York," Mr. Davis contends, noting that 86 languages are spoken in the city's schools.
Mr. Davis is not always fastidious in giving full credit for his extensive borrowings from the works of other writers on Los Angeles. In places, he relies heavily on the work of Kevin Starr, the influential historian of California. (Despite his reliance, he is quite critical of Mr. Starr.) He uses Mr. Starr's apt phrase that Los Angeles is "the Great Gatsby of American cities" but relegates attribution to his footnotes. The book also contains errors, including the consistently incorrect spelling of the last name of former Gov. George Deukmejian.
A forceful polemicist, Mr. Davis is also a serious historian and social thinker. Although knee-jerk phrases appear ("fascist obliteration," the "affluent babbitry of the Middle West" that dominated the city for decades), they are infrequent. One of several worthy pieces of history and analysis in "City of Quartz" is that on the slow-growth success of homeowners' associations in opposing the dread Manhattanizing of the region -- building skyscrapers and businesses near residential neighborhoods. The strength of these "Nimby" (not in my backyard) protests, Mr. Davis writes, meant that the destruction of the inner city "became the great non-issue during the 1980s, while the impact of growth upon affluent neighborhoods occupied center-stage."
Despite this partial protection won by the middle class and the rich, much of value in the region is being plowed up and destroyed. To conclude his study of urban devastation, Mr. Davis writes about his birthplace of Fontana, 60 miles east of Los Angeles. It was a tacky town whose citrus groves were blighted by smoke from Henry J. Kaiser's steel mill. The author ponders artifacts of Los Angeles discarded in Fontana's trash heaps, and writes that "the past generations are like so much debris to be swept away by the developers' bulldozers." Los Angeles may be that rough beast slouching toward Fontana to be junked. For Mr. Davis, the once clear, crystalline glitter of Los Angeles now faces the "junkyard of dreams."

HEADLINE: Children's Food;
Organically Grown

BYLINE: BY DULCIE LEIMBACH; Dulcie Leimbach writes the "For Children" column in the Weekend section of The New York Times.

 BODY:
My intentions were always genuine, if not resolute. What I couldn't control for my newborn son -- ozone depletion, pesticide runoff, even the college he would attend -- left me with the one course I could control: what he would eat. I nursed him, and when he was ready for more calories, I bought organic baby food -- whole-grain cereals, strained carrots, peas, green beans -- with a passion normally reserved for more intimate endeavors.
I anticipated the morning when I would stir the quick-cooking cereal over the stove, throwing in a little wildflower honey, a little milk to keep it smooth. I knew that if my son started the day with hot cereal, the rest of his day -- why, his life -- would unfold as surely as the phases of the moon. But something happened between the stove and the highchair, when the spoon touched Joseph's mouth and the cereal slid down his bib. He wouldn't eat it. 
 I am not alone in this picture. My friends who are mothers have also experienced such defeats, and we've discussed these matters with disbelief. Is this, we ask, what raising a child is all about? Are these slight -- though reverberative instances -- windows into a long future of rejections and rebellions?
Hannah Ruth Rizzi, an otherwise ladylike 1-year-old I know, recently refused her mother's offer of organic blueberries with apples. Never mind that Hannah's mother had just bought three cases of certified-organic, additive-free baby food. What was she left to do in these economically lean, environmentally overwhelmed 1990's but to spoon the rest of the stuff into her own mouth?
To some extent, many mothers nowadays are scrutinizing what their children eat and drink -- an awareness led by Meryl Streep's organization, Mothers and Others for a Livable Planet. As a result, many consider popular baby food imperfect, and are instead buying organic baby food: a business that competes for the crying mouths of the 10,000 babies born in the United States every day. And even though such rarefied food costs at least 25 cents more per jar than the ordinary fare, the most popular brand, Earth's Best, in Middlebury, Vt., estimates sales of about $10 million this year. A healthy baby hath no price.
Other certified organic baby foods have recently begun to liven up store shelves, like the German-made Perlinger. This brand is confined to health-food stores, unlike Earth's Best, which is also available in supermarkets in some areas of the country. We missed the boat on testing the Perlinger apples, rice and honey combination (worth having another baby?), because the company didn't get its products on the American market until about a year ago, when my son was past the runny-food stage.
So we carried on, slightly wary of who had the upper hand. In the air was a sense of the inevitable because I knew childhood wasn't complete without junk food. But why did it have to happen so soon? By the time Joseph was ready to chomp down on food with edges and crunch, I was ready to capitulate to all those convenience foods lurking out there, lying in wait for me: hot dogs, salty spaghetti sauces, chicken nuggets, potato puffs, french fries. How did I, someone who had scorned hot dogs since the days of Jimmy Carter's Presidency, let this happen?
A softening of the will, for one; mother-fatigue syndrome as well. Coming home from work and cooking squash for an hour, only to have my otherwise charming son turn his nose up at it, became a session of his stubbornness versus my determination. Sometimes I couldn't make it home in time for dinner, and his father, a guy who doesn't read labels, would be serving Joseph fish sticks, unaware that there was -- egad! -- MSG in them. More occasions like these ensued, until I realized I couldn't control my son's diet as much as I wanted, unless I wore a uniform and carried a large stick. Frozen macaroni, with all its unpronounceable, undefinable ingredients (why do they have to put "natural flavors" in?), was insinuating its way into my son's little mouth. Joseph, healthy but finicky, was going to eat what he wanted.
But there are better mothers than I, ones determined to avoid foods with preservatives, additives, sugars, salts. Take Nancy Teas, whose 2 1/2-year-old son, Jac, eats vegetables as if his mouth were a backhoe facing a mound of dirt. Envious? Sure, especially since Joseph hasn't let anything green stray near his lips since May 1989. Teas's life was made simple by a Happy Baby food mill when Jac was toothless, which ground up small portions of whatever she and her husband were having for dinner.
"It's not as if I go out of my way," Teas says. "But I generally feed him foods that require cooking, so it does take more time." Teas's tricks are simple: lots of brown rice and beans -- even popcorn. Her son is also a connoisseur of more foreign fare: tofu sticks (tofu strips marinated in soy sauce then baked in the oven), gomasio on broccoli, tahini and carob-chip graham-cracker sandwiches, even umeboshi plums -- Japanese pickled plums -- that he plucks from the package and drops into his mouth.
Though the following recipes don't call for fancy plums, they do enlist such ingredients as tahini and agar-agar, or kanten, an edible seaweed gel. The recipes were chosen with children in mind and refrain from using too much salt and sugar. Agar flakes, when cooked with apple juice, are transformed into a creamy, almost mousselike dessert. When rounded off with a piquant dollop of tofu whip, it moves far beyond the pale of packaged desserts. The muffins and soup are made with pureed vegetables, and are good, nutritious foods that can become an entire meal.
The tofu meatballs may not be your first choice for dinner tonight but if you just think of tofu as a chance to broaden your children's culinary horizons, and your own, it may not seem off-putting. It's as if you're approaching the universe of books. You like Tom Clancy, but occasionally think about reading something experimental, say, a Thomas Pynchon novel or two. At least you don't have to read the whole book.

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Grease 9-inch-by-12-inch cake pan.
3. In large bowl, beat together the butter, oil and honey. Add yogurt and eggs. Add dry ingredients, blending gradually. Fold in apples and nuts.
4. Pour batter into cake pan and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the top of the cake is nicely brown.
Yield: One 9-inch-by-12-inch cake.
Note: This is not your basic cake, but a cross between bread and coffee cake. We ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner two days in a row. The soy flour, walnuts and yogurt provide a good dose of protein, so it is almost like a meal. You could even top it with tofu whip -- see recipe -- to jazz it up for a party.
 
TOFU 'MEATBALLS'
(From the Moosewood Restaurant, Ithaca, N.Y.)
 
 3 cakes soft tofu (about 12 ounces each)
 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
 1 large onion, finely chopped
 3 cloves garlic, minced
 1 large carrot, grated
 1 green pepper, finely chopped
 1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil
 1 tablespoon ground fennel seeds
 3/4 teaspoon dried oregano
 2 large eggs
 1 cup whole wheat bread crumbs
 3/4 cup walnuts, ground or finely chopped
 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
 4 1/2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
 1 1/2 tablespoons dark sesame oil
 3 tablespoons tamari soy sauce
 Freshly ground pepper to taste.
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Place the tofu between two weighted cookie sheets and set aside for about 20 minutes.
2. In a skillet, heat the oil and saute the vegetables and the herbs for 10 minutes, or until tender. In a large bowl, lightly beat the eggs, then add the remaining ingredients. Mash the pressed tofu either with a potato masher or your hands and add it to the bowl, along with the sauteed vegetables. Stir well: the mixture should be firm enough to form into balls.
3. Using your hands or 2 spoons, pat the mixture into 1 1/2-inch balls and place on an oiled baking sheet. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until dark brown and firm to the touch.
Yield: Three to four dozen meatballs.
Note: Joan Adler, a partner in the Moosewood Restaurant, suggests serving the meatballs with spaghetti and sauce, stuffed into pita bread or shaped into burgers and topped with Russian dressing, lettuce and tomato. Or you can prepare and cook the mixture as meat loaf and serve with mashed potatoes and gravy.
 
FRUIT KANTEN
(From Frank Arcuri, a chef at Angelica Kitchen, Manhattan)
 
 3 cups juice (like apple or other organic fruit juice)
 1 cup water
 1/8 teaspoon salt
 2 tablespoons agar flakes
 2 tablespoons kuzu dissolved in 2 tablespoons water (kuzu is a root starch available in most health-food stores)
 Zest of one orange
 1/2 teaspoon vanilla
 Pinch mace.
 1 cup sliced fresh fruit in season.
1. In a saucepan, bring the juice, 1 cup water and salt to a boil. Sprinkle agar flakes over boiling liquid, stirring to dissolve. Lower flame and simmer 5 minutes. Stir in dissolved kuzu and cook for 1 minute. Add orange zest, vanilla and mace. Remove from heat.
2. Rinse a mold or shallow dish (about 9 inches by 9 inches) in cold water and pour in kanten mixture. Let sit until it begins to thicken, about 20 minutes, then add fresh fruit. Mix gently and let sit until jelled in refrigerator, about 1 hour. Serve garnished with tofu whip (see recipe) or chopped nuts.
Yield: Four to six servings.
 
TOFU 'WHIPPED CREAM'
(From Frank Arcuri)
 
 1 pound soft tofu
 1/2 cup maple syrup
 2 tablespoons tahini or almond butter
 Pinch sea salt
 1 cup apple juice
 1 1/2 tablespoons agar flakes
 2 teaspoons vanilla extract.
1. Place the tofu in a saucepan and cover with water. Simmer 5 to 10 minutes, or until the tofu floats. Drain.
2. In a food processor, place the tofu, maple syrup, tahini and salt and process until smooth. In a saucepan, bring the apple juice to a boil, sprinkle with the agar flakes and whisk to mix. Simmer 4 to 5 minutes, or until agar dissolves, stirring occasionally.
3. Pour agar-apple juice into tofu mixture and process just until combined. Add the vanilla and process again. Keep the mixture in the bowl of the food processor and refrigerate for about 1 hour, until jelled.
4. When the mixture has set, process again before serving.
Yield: Four cups.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION;
CBS and the Steel Magnolia

BYLINE: By MARC GUNTHER; Marc Gunther writes about television for The Detroit Free Press.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Growing up as a smalltown Southern belle, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason was taught to be nice to everyone. She was a cheerleader at her high school in Poplar Bluff, Mo., where she was voted "most popular" in her class. "Women where I'm from are raised as real people-pleasers," she says.
But Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason, the 43-year-old creator and executive producer of the CBS comedies "Designing Women" and "Evening Shade" succeeded in the male-dominated television industry only after she learned that it's not always smart to be nice. 
 There was the time, for example, when CBS took "Designing Women" off the air during its first season. Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason and her husband, the producer-director Harry Thomason, fought back by organizing a letter-writing campaign that overwhelmed the network with daily sacks of mail. One executive literally raised a white flag outside CBS, promising to put the show back on.
Then there was the Emmy Awards broadcast by Fox in 1988. The "Designing Women" stars, who were presenting an award, joked that they felt right at home on Fox because they were used to being seen on an obscure network -- CBS, which was then suffering a dismal ratings slump.
These days, she feels appreciated. "Designing Women" (Monday nights at 9:30) has become a top-10 hit. CBS executives also lavish praise on "Evening Shade," which they call a hit in the making. It has grown in the ratings and has lately won its time period, on Mondays at 8.
More than that, CBS proved its commitment by signing the biggest production deal it has ever made with an independent producer. The deal requires CBS to buy five shows over the next eight years from the Thomasons' company, Mozark Productions, for an estimated $45 million. The Thomasons personally stand to collect more than $100,000 a week in fees for each show they have on the air, CBS executives say.
CBS is gambling, especially since Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason has created only one certifiable hit, the five-year-old "Designing Women." CBS has committed not only to putting five Mozark shows on the air, but to paying full production costs. Customarily, the networks pay only a portion of costs.
Experience suggests that expensive network commitments do not always pay off. CBS's last major deal, with Grant Tinker, the former chairman of NBC, brought nothing of value to the network. And, while ABC's exclusive arrangement with Steven Bochco produced a hit in "Doogie Howser, M.D.," it also stuck the network with the bill for a costly flop, "Cop Rock."
Mr. Bochco's 1987 ABC contract for 10 shows is the largest entertainment deal ever made by a network, which has also made major commitments to the writer-producers James L. Brooks ("The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "The Simpsons") and Glenn Gordon Caron ("Moonlighting"). NBC has been reluctant to make similar production commitments. "These multimillion-dollar payoffs and these deals where we don't have the flexibility to say no simply don't make sense in today's economy," Warren Littlefield, president of NBC Entertainment, has said.
Naturally, CBS executives say the risk is worth it. "It's incumbent on us to put our money on a few prize winners," said Howard Stringer, president of the CBS Broadcast Group.
Besides, "Designing Women" and "Evening Shade" have become so important to CBS that the network simply cannot afford to lose Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason. She, as a result, has joined an elite group of writer-producers who are guaranteed not only financial security but the freedom to pursue their own ideas in prime time.
It's nice, she says wryly by telephone from her home in Los Angeles, to feel loved after all those years of dating -- and sparring -- with CBS. "I had been going steady with them for 17 years," she says. "It was time to get married."
Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason's most successful year in television has been tarnished by a very public feud with an old friend, the actress Delta Burke. The war of words began last summer when Ms. Burke, who plays Suzanne Sugarbaker, the saucy ex-beauty queen on "Designing Women," complained to a reporter that the set was "not a good workplace" and blamed the Thomasons. They shot back with a statement accusing Ms. Burke of being irresponsible and churlish.
Ms. Burke went to court in January, seeking her release from the show. She may get her wish. Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason says: "I will never know why she did this. It's been hard to take." Ms. Burke, through her publicist, declined comment, citing the lawsuit.
Although Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason grew up among lawyers -- a grandfather, her father and an older brother all practiced law -- nothing in her childhood, she says, prepared her to do business in Hollywood. She can, however, trace her sense of humor and feel for dialogue back to her upbringing.
"Humor is just a Southern given," she says. "There was a lot of laughing at our house, a lot of arguments, a lot of passion. There was a lot of conversation that stirred things up."
On a whim, she abandoned plans for law school and moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970's. There she met the actress Mary Kay Place, who suggested they write a television script. The script did not sell, but it wound up in the hands of the producer Larry Gelbart, who became her mentor and bought five of her scripts for "M*A*S*H."
Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason spent the next few years unhappily working on other people's ideas. "I took every job I was sent on because I thought it would be rude not to," she said. "They would put me with some guys named Irving and Jeff who were correcting my scripts. They didn't have a clue about comedy, usually."
Only after she married a guy named Harry in 1983 did Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason decide to produce as well as write. They met at Columbia Pictures Television, where she had noticed his Arkansas accent and introduced herself. He was a soft-spoken ex-football coach who took a protective attitude toward his younger wife. (He is now 50.) They formed Mozark Productions -- Missouri meets Arkansas -- and undertook their first project, an ABC detective series called "Lime Street," starring Robert Wagner.
It became another unhappy experience, as the Thomasons were forced to share decision-making with studio and network executives. "They had me doing stories about people who were princesses and Robert Wagner was saving them," she remembered. The show was rejected by critics and viewers, and canceled after a few weeks.
So Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason dug into her Southern roots and found "Designing Women." The idea was simple: "Get four women together and listen to them talk." She picked actresses she knew: Annie Potts and Jean Smart from "Lime Street," Ms. Burke and Dixie Carter from an earlier failure of hers called "Filthy Rich."
CBS bought the idea, and Ms. Bloodworth-Thmason wrote the perfect counter to ABC's "Monday Night Football" -- a smart, sassy show about four highly opinionated women who talk up a storm. While some critics knocked it as shrill or preachy, Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason said the speechifying is by design. "In the South, preachy is an exciting way of talking," she says. "Southerners are very sentimental and they're very sloppy about it. They really let their emotions out."
Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason wrote the entire season of "Designing Women" -- 35 scripts -- in longhand, on a yellow pad, on deadline. Howard Stringer, a Bloodworth-Thomason fan, remains impressed to this day. "In the annals of literary achievement, you'll never get Pulitzers for that," he said. "But in raw creativity and accomplishment, that's just extraordinary."
Mr. Stringer's promotion to his current job in 1988 marked a turning point for the Thomasons' relations with CBS. Over a lunch designed to mend fences, Mr. Stringer quoted jokes from "Designing Women" back to Ms. Bloodworth Thomason and said he had been embarrassed by the incident at the Emmys. Mr. Stringer says he told her, "I don't want you ever to have to get up on a stage and say that CBS doesn't know what it's doing."
Some programs take root at power lunches. "Evening Shade" took root at a power sprawl -- with Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason on the floor of her office with her husband and two CBS executives, poring over casting books in search of a star.
Mr. Stringer was there, along with Jeff Sagansky, who had cultivated the Thomasons since becoming president of CBS Entertainment. This was early June -- CBS's fall schedule had already been announced -- but Mr. Sagansky wanted another show from Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason on the air by fall.
She wanted to do an ensemble comedy about small-town America, set in Arkansas and built around a Jimmy Stewart-type character married to a younger woman. Her parents and hometown were inspirations. It was Mr. Sagansky, she recalls, who mentioned Burt Reynolds.
"That's it. It's perfect," said Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason.
"But he's at ABC," said Mr. Sagansky.
"That's your problem," said Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason.
The next day, Mr. Reynolds and the Thomasons met for lunch. Mr. Reynolds agreed to play the role of Wood Newton, a middle-aged football coach, and managed to wrest himself away from ABC.
"In the final analysis, she had a better bead on my life," Mr. Reynolds says. "I don't want to be chasing some bikini down the beach anymore -- not that I want to play Robert Young, either. But Linda is the first person who ever said to me, 'You know, I see you as Jimmy Stewart. I think you're very vulnerable and funny and small town.' "
Mr. Reynolds helped recruit a cast that included Elizabeth Ashley, Ossie Davis, Charles Durning, Hal Holbrook and Marilu Henner. The show has garnered mixed reviews and modest ratings. Mr. Stringer remains enthusiastic, noting that such CBS hits as "Designing Women" and "Murphy Brown" took time to find audiences. Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason admits that "Evening Shade" needs polishing. "These characters are not yet ingrained the way, say, Barney was on 'Mayberry,' " she says.
Ms. Bloodworth-Thomason dislikes the word sitcom and says she would like her characters to be as rich and memorable as those in great novels. "If Mark Twain were alive today, he would be writing in television," she says. "I just reread 'Little Women' not too long ago. You know, it was pretty boring. Not to disparage a great American novel, but I did not think those four women were any more interesting than Mary Jo, Julia, Suzanne and Charlene."

HEADLINE: 'The True and Only Heaven'

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Christopher Lasch, author of "The True and Only Heaven" (review, Jan. 27), may be a literate apologist for our failure to bring more of the poor, in America and throughout the world, out of misery and into the comforts and benefits of the middle-class life that he, and I, and many readers of The Book Review enjoy. But he is not an original one.
In 1927, Charles and Mary Beard explained, in "The Rise of American Civilization," that in order for the idea of progress to develop there had to be a respect for an interest in "the common business of labor and industry." As an attorney who represents employees, I can attest to the fact that this is not the case today. Although the so-called working class has a better life today than in 1927, this is true only if there is work available. With cruel layoffs in most American cities and a recession that even an overseas war cannot cure, Mr. Lasch's book gives slight balm to those whose children will have less than they did, rather than more, as the American dream promises.
According to your reviewer, William Julius Wilson, Mr. Lasch argues that "an environmental disaster would be created if the Western standard of living were successfully exported to the poorer nations of the world." This sounds like an elaborate way of saying to those who are struggling, you don't want what we have, you want spiritual values.
Such skepticism about progress used to be written off as "you'll get pie in the sky when you die, that's a lie."

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Fifth Avenue;
Retailers Place Heavy Chips on the 50's

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
INTERNATIONALISM has been on the ascendance in Fifth Avenue retailing for some years, and it is getting yet another upward thrust with a new mixed-use building for Takashimaya, the Japanese department store chain.
In Japan, the Takashimaya Group has 17 full-scale department stores. In New York City, Takashamaya has essentially been a gift shop. Its first store opened on 46th Street in 1958. Then came a move to 3,000 square feet near 43d Street in 1966. Since 1978, it has had only a second-floor gift salon. But always on Fifth Avenue. 
 It had long wanted a better avenue location, however, said Jiro Shinahara, head of Takashimaya's New York operation, "and we felt it was better to own our own building."
The new location is between 54th and 55th Streets, where the air of high fashion and expensive jewelry is purer than it is in the 40's. Takashimaya intends to appeal to a worldwide clientele with china, jewelry, leather goods and other wares sought by travelers as well as locals.
The $60 million Takashimaya project provides new reason to take notice of the upward swing in investment in high-end retailing on Fifth Avenue, particularly in the 50's. One notable expression of this was the opening of the 45,000-square-foot Bergdorf Goodman's men's store in the former F.A.O. Schwarz space on 58th Street last August. That was a $20 million project.
And just yesterday a new Henri Bendel store opened on four floors with 85,000 gross square feet of space in 712 Fifth Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets. Henri Bendel is a division of The Limited, which did not disclose the dollar investment in the store. A spokesman said that an Express store, another Limited outlet, will open in the old Bendel store on 57th Street.
All of this comes at a time when retail rents have generally declined and availabilities have increased as a consequence of the recession.
Average asking rents throughout Manhattan were down to $49 a square foot at the end of last year, according to Garrick-Aug Associates, the store-leasing firm. That is about the level that prevailed in 1983. Actual contract rents were on average 31 percent below the asking rents, the firm said.
But because of the short supply of Fifth Avenue space in the 50's, rents there are down only about 10 percent from the level of $550 a square foot a year ago, said Faith Consolo, senior vice president of Garrick-Aug.
The new investment projects confirm Fifth Avenue's long-term retailing place and underscore the importance of maintaining a street environment that will help sustain it. Blatantly garish and oversized signs and street vending of off-price merchandise work against this, although there has been some recent success in curbing the most offensive hucksterism.
The Takashimaya project is a demonstration that in specific situations it is possible to build a new structure in a high-land-value commercial street on an extremely narrow lot. Four years ago a major Brazilian development company, Gomes de Almeida, Fernandes SA, did it with an 18-story, 80,000-square-foot office building at 590 Fifth Avenue, between 47th and 48th Streets.
A new building on a narrow, midblock Fifth Avenue site presents an opportunity to carry forward a distinctive Fifth Avenue look for the long term. That look is probably at its best north of 53d Street. In the 40's, a number of surprisingly ragged town houses still survive on 20-foot plots. Owners wring substantial income from first-floor tenancies, but higher floors normally earn little.
SOME yearn for the day when two or three parcels, free of long-term lessees, can be put together with enough street frontage to make a viable building lot. Such a parcel has been assembled lately by King Fook, the Chinese antiques and crafts store, which opened a 5,000-square-foot midblock store at 675 Fifth, off 53d Street, in 1979 and recently acquired the corner property formerly occupied by a Doubleday book store.
Now King Fook owns 100 feet of avenue frontage on a block where Fortunoff's and Gucci's also have property. It is a potential development site.
The 5,600-square-foot Takashimaya site has 50 feet of frontage on the avenue. A Chandler's shoe store had been the prime tenant in a small building on the site.
The Takashimaya store will occupy 20,000 gross square feet of space on the first four levels of a 20-story, 86,000-square-foot building. The fifth floor will house Takashimaya's offices. A private Japanese club will occupy three 5,000-square-foot floors above that. Then come 10 floors of 4,200 gross square feet for offices, and, at the top, a penthouse apartment. The address is 693 Fifth Avenue.
The architect, John Burgee, says the design will reflect the style of surrounding buildings -- the Elizabeth Arden Building on one side and the St. Regis Hotel on the other. Limestone is the primary building material on a facade adorned by tall black granite columns and small gilded windows in the manner of Fifth Avenue's Scribner's store. At the setback for the office floors the color of the granite turns to red.
Real-estate professionals say that the expectation of leasing space to a private club for Japanese executives may explain how the project became economically viable. Takashimaya has not reported a signed lease, but it may expect a high rent for club occupancy. Another explanation is the demonstrated interest of the Japanese in investing in Manhattan real estate, not necessarily characteristic of retailers. "If you are a retailer you had better stick to the business you know," says Kurt Barnard, a retailing consultant.
Retailers sticking to the business they know have brought what Thomas Cusick, president of the Fifth Avenue Association, describes as a new wave of investment on Fifth Avenue. Not all of it is in the 50's, but what is in the 50's has a definite international tone.
A notable example is the gut renovation that Zegna's, the Italian men's store, undertook as a long-term lessee on six floors in the 10-store midblock building at 743 Fifth Avenue, next door to the Bergdorf's men's store. Zegna, based in Milan, has 87 stores worldwide.
"We felt that location was the key," said Richard Cohen, president of the American operation. To sell men's suits that start at $1,000 and sweaters that start at $600 it wanted to be in the company of other fashionable retailers, jewelers and perhaps banks. Zegna's has four 1,400-square-foot selling floors and two wholesaling floors, and the distinctive facade that strikes the proper note of Fifth Avenue glamor.
Another example is the move of Wempe's, the German jewelry and accessories firm, expanding into 2,800 square feet on two levels in the Peninsula Hotel, at 55th Street. Wempe's had been a subtenant of Chandler's the shoe store that was on the site that Takashimaya bought. Thirty percent of its sales are to overseas visitors, said Nicola Gerber, the proprietor. Despite the drop in tourism, its sales have doubled in the last two years, she said.
Between 55th and 56th Streets, Bally of Switzerland expanded its flagship store in the last year. Half a block away, Fendi's, an Italian leather goods and accessories store, opened its first American store. And last November the first Christian Dior boutique in New York City -- carrying made-in-France merchandise -- opened in 4,500 square feet on two floors of the St. Regis Hotel, at 55th Street.
Bergdorf Goodman has roughly tripled the space devoted to men's clothing in its lease at 745 Fifth. Bergdorf, part of the Neiman-Marcus division of General Cinema Corporation, took 66,000 square feet, which includes one floor for offices.
Bergdorf is hoping to achieve sales of $1,000 a square foot in the new store, said Peter Farwell, spokesman for the company, which is about what the men's store in the old building did. It is too early to evaluate the new store's success, he said.

A Regent's Seat For Frank Perdue Draws Protests

DATELINE: COLLEGE PARK, Md.

 BODY:
Frank Perdue has been a University of Maryland system regent for barely a month, but a number of student groups and faculty members on the College Park campus say they want him out.
Among his opponents are animal-rights advocates, who describe Mr. Perdue's record as a factory farmer as poor, saying he mistreats both his workers and his chickens. 
 Mr. Perdue is the chairman of the nation's fourth-largest producer of broiler chickens, Perdue Farms, in Salisbury. During the last year, about a dozen workers and Federal inspectors have filed complaints against Mr. Perdue for occupational-safety hazards, said Tom Devine, a lawyer for the Government Accountability Project, a Washington-based public interest group.
"If the goals of the university are simply to make money, he's good for the job," said Karen Davis, a campus English instructor who is faculty sponsor of the Animal Rights Coalition. "He doesn't support higher education. They chose him because he knows where to put money to make people think he's a swell guy."
 
 More Protests Vowed
 Now students say they will campaign for Mr. Perdue's resignation. About 50 students attended a protestlast month sponsored by the animal-rights group to call attention to Mr. Perdue's record.
Ms. Davis said coalition members would also attend all Board of Regents meetings to protest Mr. Perdue's appointment.
"We will be there with signs saying we want 'Perdue off the board' and, 'We don't want you, Frank Perdue,' " she said. "We definitely want the board to feel it's embarrassing to them as well as to the university." Ms. Davis said the coalition would collect signatures on a petition to be sent along with letters to Gov. William Donald Schaefer and local newspapers.
Mr. Perdue was appointed on Jan. 28 by Governor Schaefer to fill a vacancy on the 16-member board created by the death of John Webb.
 
Business School Benefactor
 Mr. Perdue has made several donations to Salisbury State University, one of the system's 11 campuses. One gift was of $2.5 million to establish a business school. William Kirwan, president of the College Park campus, said after the appointment that Mr. Perdue's business experience could benefit the system.
Mr. Kiwan said Mr. Perdue also knows the Governor and can relay concerns and needs of the system to him. Others also said that Mr. Perdue would be an effective regent.
"Frank Perdue has contributed more to the system than just money," said David Lasher, president of the system's student council. Mr. Lasher, a senior economics major from Salisbury, at Salisbury State, said Mr. Perdue's contributions are visible there. He said Mr. Perdue also attends football games and theater productions and invites students to his home each semester.
Although Mr. Perdue could not be reached for comment, a spokesman, Richard Auletta said, "Frank Perdue has a deep-rooted commitment to the state and will stand on his records of accomplishments and his records as a businessman."
 
'Bad for Our Image'
 But Mark Parascandola, the student president of the campus animal-rights group, said, "I'm embarrassed he will be associated with the university." Mr. Parascandola, a junior philosophy major from Silver Spring, added: "The Governor has a responsibility to choose someone who has concerns for the environment. Not only is it bad for our image, but it will affect his job if he is not sensitive to the issues."
Stuart Catalgo, a founder of the animal-rights group, said Mr. Perdue's factory farming is harmful to the environment, his workers and the health of consumers.
"It's one thing to claim it's natural to eat animals, but we're stepping outside the natural cycle with these big factories and treating animals like part of the machine," said Mr. Catalgo, a junior biology pre-med major.
Others have criticized the treatment of both chickens and employees at Perdue Farms, which has sales of more than $1 billion a year and a work force of about 14,000.
"Most of us treat our pets generally better than Mr. Perdue treats his workers," said Donna Bazemore, an employee in a North Carolina plant, told a Congressional subcommittee on labor management relations in testimony given in November 1989. She described conditions in Mr. Perdue's plants as "modern slavery" and said the poultry industry "has not shown any respect for consumers' health."
Ms. Bazemore was the first to win a workers compensation appeal against Mr. Perdue, totaling $1,200.

HEADLINE: About Cars;
The Ultimate BMW Takes a Step Up

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
I don't care how steady you are, it is hard to drive well when the cops are behind you.
I was having that trouble the other night on New York's West Side, and the police car trailed me for an eternity. Finally, at a light, the partners pulled up in the left lane and rolled down their window. And what they said to me was: "How much?" 
 How much? After all that careful driving? Ah. But that is what everybody wonders about this car, or at least that is what they wonder after they have given it the once-over, figured out what it is, and wondered again what sort of high-muckety person is driving it.
This is that sort of vehicle, the kind of car that causes all of the drivers you pass to crane their eyes. Traffic drops back for a glimpse at the rear. It pulls alongside. It steps on the gas to tweak your nose. And sometimes, when the traffic is officially municipal, it stops you. Just for a look and to ask: How much?
In this case, with paint that looks much like run-of-the-mill Ferrari and is called "brilliant red" by the factory, the how-much is $77,600, including $1,000 for the optional forged alloy wheels and the gas-guzzler tax of $3,000. That's a lot, but it is almost reasonable when you compare it to some of the competition.
Of course, you know what car we're talking about because you've seen the headline and the picture. But just to put the record straight, the paint and the hefty sticker adorned an 850i from Bayerische Motoren Werke AG in Munich, Germany, BMW's newest and flashiest offering.
And the latest version of the company's V12 automobile takes us back to 1988. That was the year in which the company put the gigantic engine into its new and lovely 750iL sedan, and I confessed at the time that I was smitten. The 750, I said, was probably the best car on the road, and I couldn't wait for its sporty incarnation.
For 1991, that version is here as a pillarless hardtop coupe, and it takes its place with the Mercedes 300 SL, Acura's NSX and Corvette's ZR1 as one of the truly great fun machines. Like them, it bristles with technological wonders. But unlike them it is a quasi sedan, and it can carry four adults -- handily, if the two in the rear are midgets.
The car is the successor to BMW's 635 CSi, but it is more than an inch shorter and five inches wider than its predecessor. Its unit body wears blackout trim, and there is a lot of flush glass. And the new design is as aerodynamic as anything on the road, with a coefficient of drag of only .29.
There is a long hood, a short deck, and a passenger cabin that is placed rearward to create a shape that not only balances front and rear aerodynamic forces at high speeds but improves crosswind stability. The windshield and rear-window pillars also provide mounting points for arches that serve as horizontal "rollbars" and allow new rigidity in a hardtop coupe.
In addition, the car is a platform for state-of- the-art electronics. They control the 5-liter engine, which puts out 296 horsepower and can be had with an electronically controlled automatic transmission or a six-speed manual. Like the 750, the new car is a rocket, and it accelerates from zero to 60 in less than seven seconds. Top speed is 155 m.p.h., and that is only because an electronic governor prevents the car from going faster.
Electronics abound elsewhere, too. The standard cellular phone, for instance, is complimented by voice-activated dialing, and the 850 has a nerve system of multiplexed wiring, which transmits several messages along each channel, simplifying the electrical connections and allowing new functions that were not possible with conventional wiring.
Among the more noticeable effects are the power-window functions, which include one-touch up and down operation and an automatic lowering of the front windows when the doors are opened. The purpose here is to protect the window seals when the doors are slammed shut, and you spot the feature right away. When you get in, there is that surprising slither as the windows close.
The chunk of the door also tells you that the 850 is as solid as a vault, but the slightly opened windows allow the doors to shut easily, and their seals keep the windows from pulling away from the body at high speed.
Once inside, you notice some of the other neat thoughts of the designers, also made possible by the multiplex wiring. A twitch of the windshield washer wand, for instance, yields an automatic three swipes by the wipers, then a pause, then another final swipe to get rid of drips.
The seats, eminently adjustable, have memory positions for three drivers. The memory includes the electrochromatic rearview mirror, the heated side mirrors and the tilt-and-telescope steering wheel, and puts them all back just the way you like them. And, of course, the passenger-side mirror flicks down to show you the curb whenever you shift the transmission into reverse.
Leather is standard in the 850, and the car smells as good as it feels. Controls for the windows, the central locking and the mirrors are in the driver's armrest, and all of the adjustments and doodads are right where they ought to be. Beyond the leather-wrapped wheel with an air bag in its hub, there is an instrument panel that holds a 185-m.p.h. speedometer and a 7,000-r.p.m. tachometer, and the dash has a computerized information display to tell you things such as outside temperature and range on fuel in the tank.
The dual-level glovebox has two doors so you can get yourself properly organized. And there are separate automatic climate controls for driver and front-seat passenger.
The sunroof tilts and slides, and the sound system is stupendous, probably owing to its 12 speakers. A standard compact-disk changer hides from thieves in the trunk, and the radio has two FM bands.
And here we come to one of the few quibbles. The radio antenna is embedded in the rear window, and like all such antennas it is less than satisfactory when you are tuning the AM band. Window-antenna technology is improving, but it isn't perfect.
A second fault in this otherwise wondrous chariot has to do with fuel economy, which is pretty much a misnomer. In a time of serious energy consciousness, a four-seater that posts a rating of 12 miles per gallon, city, and 18, highway, is a luxury indeed.
On the other hand, there won't be that many of these cars gobbling up the oil supply. And when you own one of the best, that knowledge can be one more small comfort.

BYLINE: By Jed Stevenson

 BODY:
The war in the Persian Gulf is the first in 45 years in which American soldiers are not being paid with a special military currency. Because of the relative wealth of Saudi Arabia, the stability of its economy and the ubiquity of the American dollar in the region, military authorities apparently felt that an alternative currency was not needed.
During most of World War II, soldiers stationed overseas were paid in the local currencies, but in 1946 the United States found itself holding nearly half a billion dollars of unwanted foreign currency. The Government began printing a special Allied Military Currency that was issued to all allied occupation soldiers, including Russians. This common currency facilitated a booming black market among the allied soldiers and, to a lesser extent, among German civilians. Soviet soldiers heading home knew that their Allied Military Currency would be confiscated so they paid inflated prices for articles difficult to purchase in the Soviet Union. Cameras and watches could be sold for small fortunes by the G.I.'s. 
 In the summer of 1946, the United States had nearly five million troops stationed overseas and was paying them in some 40 different foreign currencies as well as in special military notes. The deficit problem continued. But in July the military began issuing the A series of the Yen Allied Military Currency to be used by all United States soldiers in Japan for purchases in military commissaries and post exchanges. In September the new currency was printed for the troops in Europe and soon was being used from Iceland to Iwo Jima.
The wartime currency most familiar to Americans was the Military Payment Certificates issued in Vietnam. Four different issues were printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing from August 31, 1965 until March 15, 1973.
The different issues were produced because a huge market for the conversion of MPC's into dollars developed. Anyone possessing greenbacks could almost double his money by trading them illegally for MPC's. The MPC's could then be taken to huge military exchanges in Saigon to buy stereos, washing machines, cameras or other high-priced items. Goods in military exhanges are sold cheaply and untaxed, so anyone who had doubled his money by illegal conversion could buy many items and sell them to the Vietnamese who were forbidden to shop in military exchanges. Thus small fortunes were made. Legends abounded in Vietnam of soldiers who had returned to the United States with hundreds of thousands of dollars hidden in their personal gear.
To counter this activity, the military would declare a Conversion Day, kept secret until the last moment. At dawn on C-Day military bases were locked, civilian workers told to stay home and every soldier required to change his stock of Military Payment Certificates for a new and different issue. Anyone trying to change large amounts was taken aside and questioned. The old issue was declared worthless, and all notes collected were burned. Of course, the new issues played havoc with the black market, but also with the incomes of the myriads of Vietnamese casual workers -- the maids, barbers, bar girls, tailors and shoeshine boys that worked on and around the bases. C-Days could wipe out their small savings, and any rumor of an impending C-Day caused panic as workers tried to get rid of their own MPC's.
The last issue of 1970 was finally withdrawn in 1973 and MPC's have not been reissued since. All soldiers are now paid in United States dollars. But anyone who has held onto Vietnam-era MPC's is in for a pleasant surprise. The scrip, called "funny money" among the troops, has increased in value. Some notes in fine or extra-fine condition are now selling for as much as twice their face value. But an uncirculated $10 MPC note issued from late 1968 until the summer of 1969 is worth nearly $600.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
On Main Street, The Bulls Are Stampeding

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
The public is back in the market, and the speculative stocks are soaring. The money managers, suddenly bullish, are searching for laggards, afraid to stay on the sidelines. All told, it is certainly enough to make a contrarian investor nervous.
It is individual investors who are pushing up prices now. "A lot of buyers came into the market," exulted Larry Armstrong, executive vice president of Fidelity Investment's discount brokerage operations, after peace hopes brought a buying panic on Monday, with volume soaring and more than two buy orders for every sell. Even on Jan. 17, when prices leaped after the air war began, that ratio was just three to two. 
 Those buyers want action, not safety. The Russell 2,000 index of small stocks rose 2.4 percent last week. The Dow Jones industrial average added only 20.54 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,909.90.
Investors are also pouring money into all kinds of mutual funds, especially those that buy junk bonds. Merrill Lynch's junk index leaped 8.7 percent last month. Marty Fridson, who runs junk research at Merrill, says second-tier bonds led the rally, as buyers passed up the highest-quality junk, which was already trading close to face value.
It isn't only the retail investors who are eager. In early February, the so-called professionals were about as bullish as they were in September 1987, just before the crash, reports Dick Hoey, the chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Last September, when prices were far lower, they were more bearish than at any time since Mr. Hoey began his surveys of investment decision-makers in 1983.
Anyone looking for evidence of speculation need only check out LTV, the long-bankrupt steel and aerospace company. After leaping 150 percent last week, its common shares are at $2.50 each, or about $300 million for the whole company. The cause for the glee is that LTV may be on the verge of settling its pension problems, on undisclosed terms that have not been completely worked out.
When it finishes that deal, LTV will have to come up with a way to satisfy creditors who are owed $2.5 billion. Chances are that they will be offered packages of securities including gobs of common shares, badly diluting the stake of current holders.
LTV's junk bonds are rising, but not as rapidly as the shares. The best secured of the bonds still trade for 60 cents or less on the dollar, while the worst fetch a dime. Even those bonds have priority over the common holders, so it is puzzling what the stock buyers think they see. Or maybe it just proves that, when the speculative juices are flowing, a lot of people buy first and ask questions later.
Since Jan. 17, the Dow is up 16 percent, and the Russell 2,000 has soared 29 percent. Meanwhile, interest rates have stopped falling and started to edge up, on suspicions that the Federal Reserve will delay further easing while waiting to see if the recession is going to end soon.
Few wars have been as joyful for investors. Now they are betting that with peace will come prosperity, and a lot of it.

HEADLINE: Tougher Tactics to Keep Out Unions

BYLINE: By BARRY SCHIFFMAN

 BODY:
When nearly 300 workers who sew shirts for Farris Fashions in Brinkley, Ark., threatened to form a union, the owner of the factory, union organizers say, vowed to close the factory and turn it into a chicken coop if they did. It was not surprising, then, when the workers voted 202 to 60 last December against having the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Union try to negotiate a contract for them.
It was yet another setback for organized labor. Workers across the country have been steadily spurning unions over the last decade, and the tough, sophisticated tactics adopted by employers like Farris, now as a matter of routine, are a big reason. 
 The hired guns called upon by companies to help fight these battles is another. Well-versed in the complexities of labor laws and the art of persuasion, these armies of consultants, mostly law firms, are honing strategies to deter unions. The strategies range from plans to prevent workers from becoming disgruntled to using supervisors to dissuade workers from organizing.
Labor officials say they encounter these consultants at every pass and admit that their advice can be crucial. "We'll win 80 percent of the time in a moderate campaign," said Bob Callahan, an organizer with the Health Care and Social Service Union in Columbus, Ohio. "They win most of the aggressive campaigns."
One reason for employers' heightened interest in keeping unions out: As unions have weakened, companies are concerned with staying competitive with increasingly unionless rivals. That has also tempted companies to eliminate existing unions by replacing striking workers, a tactic that has led to high-visibility fights at the Daily News in New York, Eastern Airlines and Greyhound bus lines.
The upshot is that today only 16.4 percent of American workers belong to unions, less than half as many as at the end of World War II, when unions peaked. France is now the only industrialized nation less unionized than the United States, said Charles R. Perry, a professor of management and industrial relations at the Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia. "This is not a matter of philosophy," he said. "Businesses are driven and are trying to survive."
Labor's strength could continue to wane. These vigorous campaigns have increased unions' cost of soliciting prospective members to $300 to $400 each, far more than they once paid. The increased cost has forced them to concentrate organizing efforts on small shops with limited resources and steer away from units with more than a few hundred people, said Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO.
Besides the money, unions say employers have better access to workers through supervisors. Unions also object to companies' increasing reliance on threats of closure, which they claim violate laws giving workers the right to organize.
"It's incredibly hard to vote for a union when employers threaten to close down," said Duane Stillwell, the director of organizing for the Southwest Region of the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Union.
In the Farris campaign, he said, "Folks weren't voting on the union. They were voting to keep their jobs. I've never seen consultants say plants will be closed so bluntly."
With relatively low pay and poor benefits, Farris had seemed a ripe target for a union, Mr. Stillwell said. About 70 percent of the workers had signed the cards required to hold a National Labor Relations Board election to form a union.
But he said the company played so rough that the support dwindled. He said 35 workers, including key union supporters, were laid off, without any decline in work. And the company, he said, played a radio report in the factory saying that the owner, Farris Burroughs, would close the plant if employees formed a union.
Dan Kennett, a lawyer with Eichenbaum, Scott, Miller, Liles & Heister of Little Rock, Ark., which advised Farris in the campaign, said, "It is my practice not to comment on an on-going case. But of course we deny we made any threat to close the plant."
The union has filed a formal objection with the N.L.R.B. to avoid what it sees as a dangerous precedent of allowing closure threats. It is also asking the board to order Farris to recognize the union without a new election. Still, unions say, even if an employer is found to have violated the law, penalties are often so slight and remedies so long in coming that they do little to deter employers.
In these fights, management often counters that the unions are blaming employers and labor laws for their own failure to keep up with the changing American industrial landscape. "Unions claim that companies break the law," said Martin F. Payson of Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler & Krupman of New York, one of the biggest labor relations firms. "That's not true. We have a right to show drivers being shot at; trucks being firebombed. Unions view the discussion of facts as a climate of fear."
Labor lawyers are reluctant to discuss the strategies they use to keep unions from forming, but some flaunt impressive records. Ogletree, Deakins, Nash, Smoak & Stewart in Greenville, S.C., frequently cited by the AFL-CIO as a top union buster, says it has been defeated only five times in 108 N.L.R.B. elections on new union formation in the last five years. Jimmy Stewart, a partner, says the firm now has 87 lawyers in six offices, up from 16 lawyers in two offices when it opened it 1977.
Mr. Stewart says much of the firm's work is preventive. It advises hundreds of clients on how to avoid becoming union targets. Keeping employees content, he said, is key. "Negotiation and campaigning is the tip of the iceberg," he said. "We try to establish a positive morale. We assist in policy development, in such things as employee involvement programs, peer grievance reviews. We've got clients who have employees interview and hire people. Other clients have employees participate in the selection of supervisors."
In one of its most noteworthy cases, the firm helped turn away the United Auto Workers at the Nissan plant in Smyrna, Tenn., in July 1989. Nissan uses Ogletree, Deakins to review its campaign, which Gail Neuman, Nissan's general counsel and vice president of human resources, said is based on treating workers fairly. "We involve them in decisions that affect their lives, and we believe that allowed the employees to believe the union could do nothing for them," said Ms. Neuman. She noted that Nissan uses 120 video monitors in the plant to communicate with workers.
The fringe benefits of this approach are substantial, says Mr. Payson of Jackson, Lewis. "Turnover can go down, productivity up, accidents down, errors down."
But once workers call in union organizers, the consultants often set up other programs for employers, through which they tap the help of supervisors to keep unions out.
In a bitter fight in late 1989, the Montgomery County Health Department in Dayton, Ohio, defeated an organizing drive by the Health Care Union, part of the Service Employees International Union. It was a stinging defeat, since one bright spot in labor's retreat has been public employment. Public employers cannot threaten to close and are vulnerable to pressure from voting blocks.
The union filed a complaint that the agency, assisted by Employee Relations Consultants Inc. of Dayton, misused its 70 supervisors to campaign employees for a no vote. Ohio law mandates that both sides have equal access to employees, a weapon union organizers do not have in the private sector, which is under the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Act.
 Consultants commonly try to scare supervisors, said Mr. Callahan of the Health Care and Social Service Union. "They tell them that unions will destroy the company; they say employees will be able to defy them," he said. "They hone each supervisor into a maniacal anti-union campaigner. They emphasize a loss of controlin the workplace. They talk about a family relationship."
The agency says it was simply trying to counter the union and felt that any problems could be resolved without one, said Ken Dahms, the agency's supervisor for legal services. He added that neither the county health board nor top agency officials ever officially urged rejecting the union.
The Ohio Labor Relations Board ruled that the union could conduct a new election, a decision appealed by the employer. The union responded by renewing its unsuccessful attempt for an order forcing the employer to recognize it without an election.
If there is a new election, the union says, time favors the employer. The organizing drive began in July 1989, and an election was not held until December of that year. The issue is still unresolved. Even with restrictions on the county, the outcome of the election is unpredictable.
 
 
 
NEW TACKS BY UNIONS, TOO
 After years of setbacks, organized labor is searching for a way to reverse its decline. The AFL-CIO has spent millions of dollars on its Union Yes television advertising campaign. Rather than wait for workers to call, it has hunted targets for organizing unions in several areas, including Orlando, Fla., Fort Smith, Ark., and Orange County in California.
Several unions, mostly in the fast-growing service industries, have greatly stepped up organizing. Their success rate in National Labor Relations Board elections has risen to 49 percent, from a low of 45 percent in the mid-1980's. The renewal is not lost on management. Said Martin F. Payson of Jackson, Lewis, Schnizler & Krupman of New York, a big labor relations firm, "Starting in 1988, unions are on the march."
The Service Employees International Union's three-year effort to organize 6,000 janitors in Washington, called Justice for Janitors, barely resembles a traditional campaign.
Organizing janitors is difficult, because high turnover makes it tough to get a fix on the work force, and because the real bosses are building owners who contract the cleaning services that hire janitors, said Steve Lerner, who directs the union's effort to organize the services.
"It's a question of what you do with a striker's time," said Lerner. Rather than pressure the cleaning services, the union has held demonstrations at office buildings and tried to meet with their tenants and investors. It has also carried its demonstrations to the building owners' homes.
In the political arena, it has tried to link the organizing drive to issues like homelessness and is pushing for increases in property taxes. "We appeal to the conscience of the tenants," Mr. Lerner said. "The issue isn't whether the building gets cleaned but what kind of city are we going to have."
Through these means, the union has won areawide contracts for janitors in many big cities, but it has had limited success in Washington, where only 500 janitors in the private sector are under contract, Mr. Lerner said.
Margaret O. Jeffers, executive director of the Apartment and Office Building Association, dismissed the union's approach as harassment and said its members have no business becoming involved. Some owners have tried to ban anyone connected with the union from their buildings. The union won a preliminary ruling against the association for its role in the ban, which is being challenged in the District of Columbia courts.
One of the union's more unusual tactics is personal. "We'll try to embarrass an individual building owner," Mr. Lerner said. "We try to point out the contradiction in the public persona and what happens to the people who clean their buildings."
For example, the union compared janitors' pay at buildings owned by real estate developer Mortimer Zuckerman with editorials in U.S. News and World Report, which he owns, calling for a raise in the minimum wage. In 1988 the union carried its message about Mr. Zuckerman to the Artists vs. Writers softball game in the Hamptons on Long Island.

Thai Stocks: Unharmed by a Coup

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
The stock market in Thailand is rumbling along, barely jolted by the military coup a week ago that deposed the first directly elected Prime Minister since 1976. Many analysts also seem unfazed by the bloodless takeover and still see Thailand as one of the most attractive markets in Asia, even though it has already rallied 25.5 percent this year.
Thailand continues to draw investors, even after the coup, because of its large potential for economic growth. In addition, it offers good values in light of the sharp fall in the stock exchange after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last August. The quick rise in oil prices to more than $40 a barrel sent the Thai market tumbling 52.4 percent, a reflection of the country's deep dependence on imported oil. The subsequent fall in oil prices, and the quick prosecution of the war, sparked the rally this year, putting the emphasis for further gains on fundamentals. 
 The coup deposed the Government of Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan and installed a temporary Government headed by the supreme military commander, Gen. Sunthorn Kongsompong. The leaders of the coup cited rampant corruption as a reason for the takeover. But the military was also very worried about the meddling of the civilian Government in its affairs.
A temporary Prime Minister is supposed to be named soon, and a new Constitution is supposed to be written making elections possible by the end of the year.
But the coup leaders seem to be having trouble finding someone to serve as the interim Prime Minister, and its difficulties could portend a period of intense volatility for the stock market.
There have been ups and downs already. The market fell 7.3 percent on Monday, the first trading day after the Saturday coup. But it stabilized quickly, partly because Thailand is a country used to coups and military intervention; there have been 17 coup attempts since the end of the nation's absolute monarchy in 1932.
As the shock of the latest coup wore off a bit on Tuesday and the temporary Government sought to ease concerns of local and foreign investors, the market rose 5.7 percent. It fell a bit on Wednesday, took a holiday breather on Thursday and then rallied 2.8 percent Friday. The market's main index ended the week at 790.46, just below the pre-coup level of 791.60.
The two closed-end Thailand country funds traded on the New York Stock Exchange -- the Thai Fund and the Thai Capital Fund -- mirrored the seesaw pattern. The funds both fell on Monday and rebounded by Friday. At week's end, the Thai Fund was up 12.5 cents, to $20.25, while Thai Capital was off just 25 cents, to $10.25.
For many Americans, these funds provide an easier and cheaper way to get into the Thai market than buying stocks directly. Although foreigners are allowed to buy Thai stocks, they have to purchase special shares that often cost more than the same local shares. By contrast, the two funds, which invest in many of the same stocks, can buy the local shares themselves. Reflecting the strong interest in the Thai market, the Thai Fund is priced at a 20 percent premium to its net asset value, while Thai Capital has a 5 percent premium.
John Janesch of Crosby Securities in New York is attracted by the price-to-earnings ratios in Thailand, among the lowest in Asia. The coup does not worry him. "These guys will work to make it look positive," he said.
Barton Biggs of Morgan Stanley & Company, which is the portfolio manager of the Thai Fund, said that Thailand is probably a little better off with a military Government as it moves ahead to develop its economy.
"The coup is bullish," Mr. Biggs said. "A developing country that is bootstrapping itself has a lot of tough decisions to make, and the democratic process may not be the best way to do it."
Mr. Biggs also feels that the sharp fall in stock prices after the invasion of Kuwait has given the market "the cold bath it needed." The drop in tourism in the country is also helping cool the economy, although inflation is still expected to rise this year.
A warning word, however, comes from Ron Napier, a strategist at Salomon Brothers in London. Even before the coup, he had put Thailand on his neutral list. He is troubled by the country's burgeoning trade deficit, which is now close to 12 percent of total economic output. He is also concerned about the fast pace of growth in the economy, although it is slowing.
And he is worried that the military might not hold to the policies that could cool the economy and the deficit, like the rise in interest rates of 250 basis points at the end of November. The military Government may have given some inkling of this bent at the end of the week when it announced a drop in gasoline prices, a cut in the top tax rate and an increase in tax deductions for a majority of the country's workers.
"After the runup this year, you probably should be taking profits," Mr. Napier said. But with a mind to the longer term, he added: "We are not saying that the market will fall apart. We are just saying it will not go up very much."

HEADLINE: The Big Spoils From a Bargain War

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Could paying for the Persian Gulf war prove as easy a ride for Americans as fighting it? Economists take a perverse pride in supplying the rain for every parade. But even the most cautious are showing signs of being swept up in the euphoria of victory.
The war has been fought on the cheap, economists argue, and largely at the expense of Washington's allies. "The costs to America aren't zero," said Charles Schulze of the Brookings Institution, "but they aren't large." And while the spike in oil prices that followed the imposition of sanctions against Iraq apparently tipped the American economy into recession last fall, there is reason to believe that the quick defeat of the Iraqi Army will help tip it out. 
 The long-term economic consequences are harder to reckon because they turn on who rules the Middle East, and what they have in mind for oil consumers. Here, too, though, optimism seems to be bursting out all over.
Increased demand for capital for the reconstruction of Kuwait may raise interest rates, trimming investment in the rest of the world. And the burden of playing cop to the New World Order could conceivably slow the planned decline in American military outlays, leaving less to spend on everything from preschool education to potholes. But in the view of many analysts, these potential drags on growth will be more than offset by victory's salutary effect on energy prices.
"The countries with capacity will have a tremendous need to pump oil," notes Robert Reischauer, the director of the Congressional Budget Office. As a consequence, energy prices are likely to be depressed for years to come, boosting the growth prospects of the oil-importing economies.
Equally important, Saudi Arabia will be under pressure to work harder to stabilize oil prices, reducing the prospect of shocks to the industrialized economies. "If the gulf states acknowledge their obligation," concludes Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard economist, "we are talking about a big impact."
Ordinarily, a large part of the price of war must be figured in terms of weapons expended. But as Mr. Reischauer points out, this is no ordinary war. For one thing it comes on the heels of the Soviet collapse, leaving NATO equipped to fight Communist hordes who are now too busy scrounging for food to think about breaching the Fulda Gap.
According to the Defense Budget Project, a Washington-based research group, the American arsenal still contains some 5,000 Patriot missiles. Congress might think twice before replacing the few hundred launched against Saddam Hussein's Scuds. It might also wonder about the need to buy more TOW anti-tank missiles, which numbered 267,000 on the eve of the gulf war. At the very most, coalition forces expended a few thousand of them on the race to the Euphrates, leaving enough to destroy every tank left in the world and then some.
Of course, the war has not been fought entirely out of inventory: a half-million soldiers and their equipment require lots of care and feeding. But by the Bush Administration's own accounting, cash and in-kind contributions from the allies will cover these costs. Most likely, the Pentagon will be left with a profit.
 
The Bottom Line
 Had Saddam Hussein called it quits the day before the ground invasion, the Administration estimates that the bill for the war would have come to $45 billion. If the invasion had proved to be an equipment-consuming slugfest lasting through March, the total would have been $60 billion. And in light of the easy victory, it's likely that the final official reckoning will be a lot closer to $45 billion than to $60 billion.
On the other side of the ledger, the allies are pledged to deliver $53.9 billion to Washington. Although just $14.9 billion of that total has been received thus far, only the Japanese have shown signs of balking -- and only on a portion of their $9 billion pledge.
The small surplus implied by these figures may, on closer inspection, prove quite substantial. Mr. Reischauer diplomatically suggested in his testimony to the House Budget Committee last Wednesday that some Administration estimates of the cost of the war may be "overstated." Among other things, he cited two oil-related items:
* The Pentagon included higher fuel bills for American forces operating outside the Persian Gulf as a cost of the war. Possible padding: $2.8 billion.
* The Administration also assumed that oil prices would average far more for the rest of the year than they are today. If it is assumed instead that today's price of about $19 a barrel will hold for the rest of 1991, the bill for war-related fuel would be halved.
There are numerous other figures that have raised eyebrows. Ships and planes by the hundreds will be needed to bring home the soldiers and their equipment. One must wonder, though, whether the Pentagon bothered to check the Yellow Pages for cheaper charters: it is budgeting $5.2 billion -- roughly $10,000 per person.
Then there is the pesky issue of accounting for the loss of weapons that may be redundant, now that the Warsaw Pact has given up the ghost.
Mr. Schulze worries that the Pentagon is lumping unrelated costs into the Desert Storm estimates as a subterfuge for raising total military spending -- a worry that seems credible since the Administration is asking Congress to replace more Patriots, Tomahawks and TOW's than it fired at Iraqi targets.
But experts with more sympathy for the Administration see another motive for fudging war costs: nobody wants to give the allies an excuse to renege on the $39 billion still owed. If, as Mr. Schulze suggests, the actual cost of mauling the Iraqi Army runs to less than $30 billion, Uncle Sam will end up pocketing a nice piece of change.
 
Big Losses in Output
 This war ledger does not, however, represent the last word on the economic cost of squashing Saddam Hussein. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, thinks a combination of war jitters and higher oil prices triggered the recession last fall. Even if it ends soon, tens of billions of dollars in output will have been lost.
This explanation for the recession must be taken with a dash of skepticism. Economists ranging from Harvard's Mr. Friedman (a Keynesian) to Carnegie-Mellon's Alan Meltzer (a monetarist) think the Fed's failure to ease credit sufficiently last year had a lot to do with the onset of the recession. Still, the circumstantial evidence for the war-shock theory is impressive.
Mr. Reischauer estimates that oil prices averaged about $12 a barrel above normal from late August through mid-December. The $12 hike acted like an excise tax, draining away purchasing power at an annualized rate of $20 billion. And in September consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board's index, took the largest one-month dive ever recorded.
Philip Verleger, an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, holds the Bush Administration responsible for the oil price spike. Once the President decided to send troops to the Persian Gulf, a jump in prices may have been inevitable. Mr. Verleger says, however, that the price spike could have been blunted with sales from the Government's 600 million barrel oil reserve. "If we had used the strategic reserve in August," he insists, "we would have cut the economic dip in half."
 
Adding to the Woes
 One way or another, though, the war did add to the nation's economic woes. At the very least, says John Taylor of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, "it was icing on the cake."
If the war did indeed nudge the economy into the recession, will its quick and decisive conclusion pull the economy out? Oil prices returned to pre-conflict levels with the start of the air campaign in January, but shoppers have been slow to return to the malls. Auto sales are still depressed; airlines and related travel industries are still sputtering on one engine. Nonetheless, some experts believe the auguries for recovery are positive:
* Consumer confidence rose a tad in February, a number of surveys showed, and might be expected to rise more on news of the smashing success of the ground war.
* Military orders already in the pipeline are spurring demand. These purchases can be expected to have more than the usual impact on economic output because they are being financed with foreign cash rather than domestic borrowing. Demand created by deficit spending, notes Mr. Reischauer, would have raised interest rates a bit, partly offsetting the stimulative effect of Government spending.
* The economy will soon reap the benefits of another dive in oil prices, Mr. Verleger predicts. Inventories of oil are exceptionally high for a season in which demand is certain to ebb. And the pressure exerted by this oil overhang could be reinforced by expectations of a glut. Nobody, after all, wants to be caught with excess supplies when Kuwait and Iraq struggle back to the export market.
With luck, the war will help as much coming out of the recession as it hurt going in. But what about the consequences of the gulf war thereafter?
One thoroughly unpleasing prospect is higher interest rates, as Kuwait goes on a buying spree to rebuild from the sand up. While no one really knows how much it will cost to repair the war damage, numbers as high as $100 billion have been tossed around. Much of the money will no doubt come from Kuwait's hoard of cash. But whether the money is borrowed or drawn from bank accounts, it represents a drain on world savings and will thus increase the cost of capital for everyone from I.B.M. to the U.S. Treasury to Joe Homebuyer.
 
Bad Timing
 The timing could hardly have been worse. Mr. Friedman of Harvard notes that real interest rates -- interest less expected inflation -- are already high by historical standards. And even without help from the Kuwaitis, rates might have gone higher.
The Japanese, who have supplied much of the world's savings over the last decade, are finally beginning to take our advice and spend more on themselves. The Germans, who supplied most of the rest, will need every pfennig they can muster to bring East Germany up to Western living standards.
But Kuwait's demand for capital is not entirely bad news for the home team: the foreign companies who supply the goodies will mostly be American. Kuwait has traditionally looked to America for everything from drill bits to fried chicken franchises. And now that the U.S. Marines have retaken Kuwait City, Kuwaiti officials are making no secret of their wish to look even harder.
Caterpillar, Raytheon, Motorola, American Telephone and Telegraph, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have already bagged contracts. The rest of the Fortune 500 are no doubt in line.
Another nagging worry is the cost of defense. Before the gulf war, the Bush Administration proposed to reduce military expenditures by 20 percent over five years, winding down the arms surge of the Reagan era. Might the sweet taste of success in the gulf lead the President to change his mind?
That prospect worries Mr. Friedman, who fears that military spending will crowd out both public and private investment. And President Bush's request last week for money to replace more missiles than he lost in the gulf is hardly reassuring. But Mr. Reischauer argues that the political constraints on military outlays are still likely to bind.
Under last year's budget agreement, Washington is committed to a cap on military spending through 1993. Thereafter, Congress and the President could increase outlays -- but only at the expense of non-military programs. And Mr. Reischauer scoffs at the idea that anything less than a resurrection of the Soviet threat could break a deal that was so painfully wrought. "What happens in the U.S.S.R.," he concludes, "is going to determine the pace of defense spending."
In any case, the gulf war's impact on interest rates or military outlays pales beside the war's likely impact on oil prices. And here the tea leaves are coming up roses.
The key conflict within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is between hawks (like Libya and Iran), who are desperate for every oil dollar they can earn, and doves (like Saudi Arabia), who want to make sure there is a market for their oil 20 years down the road. Breaking Saddam Hussein's power to intimidate the gulf producers, argues Daniel Yergin, author of "The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money and Power," should put the doves firmly in control. "The people who will be dominating oil prices," he says, "will want to be long-term secure suppliers."
 
Falling Lower?
 Before his invasion of Kuwait, Saddam Hussein was pressing for $25-a-barrel oil -- the price he needed to pay the interest on loans from the West without cutting back on weapons purchases or imports of consumer goods. Now, oil prices are already under $20, and in Mr. Verleger's view could soon fall by another $4 to $5.
What is more, Mr. Verleger believes the price is likely to remain below $20 for many years. Iraq and Kuwait will surely pump all the oil they can for the foreseeable future. And Saudi Arabia, which ran its cash reserves down to nothing during the war, will be in no position to offset the depressing effect on prices by turning down its oil taps.
Lower oil prices mean fewer dollars going abroad, raising Americans' domestic purchasing power. It also means less investment in domestic energy, Mr. Friedman notes, freeing capital for more productive uses (while also making the United States more dependent on foreign energy sources).
Over a decade, the difference between $15 oil and $25 oil is one to 1.5 percentage points in economic growth, Mr. Verleger reckons. And from such little acorns do mighty oaks grow: a gain of one percentage point in G.N.P. translates as $60 billion a year, year after year after year.
Good news for oil importers, of course, is bad news for oil exporters -- among them our friends, Mexico and Venezuela. And low oil prices could put a spanner in Mexico's good work to reform its inward-looking, interest group-ridden economy.
But Mr. Verleger is not impressed. "Mexico," he says, "could offset the effect of lower prices by opening the market to technically savvy foreign producers." And Venezuela, he argues, could seize the opportunity to diversify its oil-dependent economy.
Nobody, it seems -- not even the dismal scientists -- is ready to spoil the victory celebration.
 
 
 
PROBLEMS THAT WON'T DISAPPEAR
 Victory in the gulf should provide a welcome boost to the American economy in the form of lower oil prices and, perhaps, a surge in consumer spending. But few analysts believe that the recession will succumb as rapidly to Washington's will as the Republican Guard. Consider the problems dogging economic policy makers:
The credit crunch. Battered by losses on commercial loans and under the gun to increase their capital reserves, big "money center" banks are reluctant to make any but the safest loans to business. Insurance companies, traditionally a major source of capital for corporations and developers, are also pulling in their horns.
The money markets aren't dead; resourceful borrowers are turning to smaller banks or raising money through sales of short-term securities. But the banks' problems have surely complicated the Federal Reserve's cautious effort to ease credit in the last few months.
The S.& L. overhang. The fact that hundreds of savings and loans are dead or dying has no direct effect on the availability of credit. But these institutions have dumped tens of billions of dollars worth of real estate on Uncle Sam's doorstep -- real estate that sooner or later must be sold. And this overhang is depressing property values, impoverishing the balance sheets of solvent mortgage lenders and hurting the construction industry.
The looming capital shortage. Through most of the 1980's, Americans spent beyond their collective means, looking to Germany and Japan to make up the difference. Now our thrifty allies have decided they have better ways of investing their money at home. The result: higher interest rates on securities denominated in yen and marks.
The Federal Reserve can still keep a lid on American interest rates -- but only at the risk of further depressing the exchange value of the dollar. And some policy makers are reluctant to see the dollar fall because it would raise the cost of imports and kick up inflation.
The demise of fiscal policy. The budget deal struck last summer offers some hope that the deficit gap will be closed by 1995. But one price of the deal was the effective abandonment of spending increases and tax cuts as a means of stimulating the economy.
Under the agreement, Washington has the discretion to declare an economic emergency and spend beyond the deficit reduction targets. But both the White House and Congress are deeply reluctant to revisit the scene of the budget crime. It would probably take a long and much deeper recession to change many minds.

Chief economist at CRT Government Securities, New York
 The end of the war provides an uptick in consumer confidence, but the underlying economic fundamentals - declines in employment, industrial production and capital spending - will remain weak.
 Interest rates will fall further, but the source of the decline is changing. Whereas real rates fell in 1989-90 to reflect subsiding demand pressures associated with the deteriorating ecomomy, rates will continue to fall in 1991 in response to declining inflation. This would be associated with a sustained rise in the dollar.
 
Cynthia Latta
Senior financial economist at D.R.I./McGraw Hill, Lexington, Mass.
 The quick end to the war means an early end to the recession, although underlying probelms - high vacancy rates, tight state and local government budgets, high corporate and houshold debt, restraints on Federal spending and excess capacity - will dampen the recovery.
 High interest rates will also hamper U.S. activity. Strong demand for capital to rebuild Eastern Europe and Kuwait will keep interest rates high.
 The positve side of this situation, however, will be strong demand for U.S. exports.
 
David Hale
Chief economist at Kemper Financial Company, Chicago
 Several factors suggest the recession should end during the second quarter. Consumer confidence is poised for a healthy rebound; home affordability is the best in 14 years.
 Inflation will fall sharply because of lower prices for oil and industrial commodities.
 Because of slower growth in the world economy and the capital problems of U.S. banks, the rebound will be less robust than the first year of previous postwar recoveries, but output growth should average 3% while inflation remains below 4%.

 BODY:

AFTER THE WAR
 
In 1930, when pearl-diving was the largest industry in Kuwait, Japan's development of cultured pearls wrecked Kuwait's economy. Now one of the world's wealthiest nations, Kuwait has seen its livelihood ruined again, its power and desalting plants destroyed, its oil wells feeding fires that blacken the skies. But few such devastated nations have ever had such gleaming prospects. With an estimated $100 billion in investments abroad, and most of its oil still securely in the ground, Kuwait has the cash and the credit for rebuilding. The Kuwaitis say the allies who fought the hardest will benefit the most; American companies have won about 70 percent of the 200 contracts signed so far. Kuwait has asked the Bechtel Group to manage the reconstruction of its oil industry, potentially a $10 billion task. Caterpillar Inc. is selling diesel engines to provide emergency power; Motorola Inc., portable telephones, and the Raytheon Company, air traffic control gear. Kuwait plans to not only rebuild but also modernize, promoting private enterprise and taking the nation another step beyond reliance on diving for pearls or drilling for oil. Kuwait would just as soon have an economy efficient enough to manage without the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian and Jordanian guest workers, whose political leanings are suspect.
 
The War Payment Plan
 
Even as American companies gain contracts, the United States is likely to continue paying some costs of its Persian Gulf mission. With rebuilding expenses of $50 billion to $100 billion -- in the same range as the post-World War II Marshall Plan -- Kuwaiti borrowing could squeeze credit around the world. Many analysts suggest that payments from allies will more than cover American military expense. But Hermann F. Eilts, a former Ambassador to Egypt and Saudi Arabia who now directs the Boston University Center for International Relations, said that some nations might have second thoughts. Germany is burdened by reunification costs, he noted, and Japanese legislators are likely to renege on the Government's promises to the United States. "When the shooting is over, they find reasons to limit their payments," he said. "That means you and I are going to pay."
 
Return of the Oil Jitters
 
The war ended, but the oil jitters resumed. A barrel of crude, down sharply since the allied assault began Jan. 17, eased back up by $1.47 a barrel to $19.38 last week. Some oil traders voiced fears that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would soon agree to cut back production. And Kuwait is unlikely to resume shipping oil for several months. Iraq, who knows when? But several energy analysts said that the world has already shown it can survive a winter without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil; the longer run worries them much more. Christopher Flavin, an energy specialist at the Worldwatch Institute, said that with worldwide consumption growing and Soviet production falling, the real squeeze could come in the mid-1990's.
 
G.N.P. Hints at Rebound
 
A revised estimate of the nation's output for the fourth quarter last year provided some evidence that the economy is poised for a rebound in the coming months. The Commerce Department said the the gross national product fell at an annual rate of 2 percent, compared to an initial estimate of 2.1 percent. But inventories were revised down, meaning that manufacturers would have to increase production to meet any stronger demand after the the victory in the Persian Gulf.
 
Economists Turn Upbeat
 
Economists had a mind last week to emphasize the favorable aspects of statistics that still tell of a recession. Consumer confidence remained at depressing levels last month, according to the Conference Board's survey, but analysts noted that it rose for the first time since September. Purchasing managers, responding to another survey, also remained downcast, but again, not as dismal as the month before. The government's index of leading indicators fell four-tenths of 1 percent for January, the sixth straight decline, but economists tended to say that the end of the war, an expanding money supply and a rising stock market in February virtually guarantee that the next report will be more favorable. "You are forming a bottom," said Rosanne M. Cahn, an economist at First Boston. "There is no question about that." She said that growth is likely to resume in mid-year.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Revlon on the Block?
 
Strip away the makeup, the multibillion-dollar estimates of his worth, and underneath, Ronald O. Perelman is a man facing a possible cash squeeze. Revlon Inc., his giant cosmetics company, is holding sales talks with Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal and Unilever, at prices estimated in the billions. Analysts say that Revlon cannot continue to pay off its heavy debts without selling assets.
 
Selling The Daily News
 
The survival of the Tribune Company's Daily News now depends on finding a buyer. Talks to settle a strike collapsed last week and The News is trying to negotiate a sale to Robert Maxwell, the British publisher.
 
The Wallenbergs Reach Out
 
The Wallenbergs of Sweden offered $2.27 billion last week for the portion of Saab-Scania A.B. that they do not already own. The family, which already controls Swedish companies with a market value of between $31 billion and $36 billion, is apparently preparing for Sweden's entry into the European Community and the easing of restrictions on foreign investment.
 
Choosing an Indy Pace Car
 
The Chrysler Corporation's manner of demonstrating patriotic fervor entails as many swerves and scrapes as a 60-mile-an-hour drive though rush-hour traffic. On Monday, Chrysler scrapped plans for its Japanese two-seater, the Dodge Stealth, to be the pace car in the Indianapolis 500. To take its place, the company is rushing out a prototype of the sinuous Dodge Viper. "The Viper is a symbol of the can-do attitude and the technical innovation of the American auto industry," a Chrysler executive proclaimed. It also demonstrates the prowess of the Italian auto industry, where Lamborghini, a Chrysler subsidiary, aided in the Viper's development. Or maybe it really is an apt American symbol. One prototype developed a cracked engine block, and Chrysler only trusts the pace car to manage a single ceremonial lap. If another car is needed during the race, Chrysler will send in the Japanese Stealth.
 
A Looser Accounting Rein?
 
The four agencies that oversee the nation's banks and savings and loans recommended looser accounting standards on Friday to ease a credit crunch. Critics questioned whether the Government should weaken the rules when so many banks are in trouble.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY


Banks and Insurance
 
It's not exactly a bailout for banks. Maybe more of a siphoning operation, keeping the banking system afloat with the help of as much as $25 billion in Federal loans. Last Thursday, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, proposed a $64.4 billion, five-year plan to keep the insurance deposit fund solvent. Annual bank insurance premiums, now 19.5 cents per $100, would increase by at least 3.5 cents, or more depending on how much the fund borrows. Some features of his plan require Congressional approval, while others need only the backing of the F.D.I.C. The insurance fund, at $8.4 billion, stands at its lowest ratio to deposits since it was created during the Depression.
 
Verdict on the Keating Five
 
The Senate Ethics Committee said their doings reflected "poor judgement" at the least, but most of the Keating Five are claiming that they have been cleared. In a statement last Wednesday, the committee accused Senator Alan Cranston of misconduct in taking contributions from Charles H. Keating Jr., an executive of a failing savings and loan. Actions by Senators Dennis DeConcini and Donald W. Riegle Jr. appeared improper, the committee said, and Senators John Glenn and John McCain had failings of judgement. "I am, of course, relieved that I have been exonerated," said Senator McCain. It remains to be seen whether voters, who have been outraged over the costs of rescuing Mr. Keating's institution and hundreds of others, are equally relieved.
 
A Lag in the Mag Trade
 
There's Crochet Celebrations and Girls of Outlaw Biker. Kansas City Live! and Kamikaze! and Missouri Wine Country Journal. A choice of Metal Party, Metal Explosion, Metal Revolution, Future Metal or Heavy Metal Mania Pinups. Space Monsters and Monster Truck Spectacular, too. All among 536 entries in Samir Husni's Guide to New Magazines for 1990. Dr. Husni recorded a decline in new titles last year, from 599 in 1989, for the first time since he started the guide six years ago. Sex again accounts for the most new titles, with 62, followed by life style and service, then sports.

HEADLINE: The Fine Art of Coping With Taxes

BYLINE: By TOM SAWYER; Tom Sawyer is a freelance writer based in Brooklyn who covers tax issues.

 BODY:
Gregory Russell, a Manhattan artist who works in a youth program through the day so he can paint through the night, is attacking the conflict between finding time to paint and earning enough to pay the rent, by taking a close look at his taxes.
"If I save $500 in taxes, that's $500 I can keep," he said. 
 After paying his income taxes last year, he asked himself: "How can I maximize what I'm making and keep what I am bringing in? How can I work with these taxes?"
He now keeps careful records of the expenses involved in producing his art so he can take the deductions allowed a self-employed person, instead of filing the short form, as he always had.
Mr. Russell, who is unmarried and 35 years old, became deeply frustrated last year about how much he had needlessly paid in taxes. Working at a daytime job to make ends meet often left him drained by the time he could approach his canvas.
"What I was doing, by not doing, was making it difficult for me to create images," he said. "I'm looking to be more independent and self-sufficient in terms of my art, so I'll have to invest less of my time in supplementing my income with a job."
Mr. Russell said he became angry last year when he was filing his taxes and realized that for years he had been throwing deductions away. He also felt the sting of turning 35 without having made painting his career, despite his dedication to it, and despite a proven market for his work in sales, honors and gallery shows.
Mr. Russell said he would probably be much closer to his dream of supporting himself with his art if he had treated his painting as a business for tax purposes and deducting expenses.
"If I think of all the money I've given away, it makes me angry," he said. "Rather than being closer to financial security, I'm further away. I did myself a disservice by not seeking information in regard to taxes."
He said his tax filing this year is an important first step. In addition to reporting his "meager" salary from a his 35-hour-a-week job as a program director in a youth organization in Brooklyn, he will report his art sales as self-employment income on Schedule C. He used to report it as "other income" on his 1040 form. That change will allow him to deduct thousands of dollars in expenses from his gross receipts before determining how much tax he has to pay.
"I ask for a receipt for everything, and I make a note on the back of it," he said. "If I rent a car to go to Washington to take paintings, I keep receipts. I'm going to the Middle West to be a visiting artist in the latter part of February. I'll get receipts."
He hopes to buy a half-interest in a loft by the end of the year instead of renting an apartment and working in a makeshift studio in his dining room. As a buyer, he could deduct his mortgage interest and could build equity.
"I would like to invest with a friend in buying a living- and working-space," he said. "It's ridiculous to pay close to $1,000 a month, when, for a small amount more, you can own and have an investment."
Despite his lack of any appreciable savings, he thinks he can make his share of the downpayment through painting sales this year, and can qualify for a loan on the basis of his job income, his stock of finished paintings, his record of sales and a body of work he is creating. He is now working on large triptychs about AIDS.
"If I were to tell anything to a young artist just starting out and setting up, it would be to put his taxes in order," he said. "It's been a painful learning experience."
 
 
 
Midlife, Middle Bracket
Defending Income Against the Bite
 Ron and Anne Sinico, both 40-year-old teachers, would seem to be the sort of middle-income people Congress had in mind when it overhauled the tax laws with the goal of making them simpler and fairer. But Mr. Sinico says bluntly, "Tax reform didn't do me any favors whatsoever."
Indeed, taxes take a bigger bite from the couple's income now than they did before the Tax Reform Act of 1986, he said, adding that the percentage of their income that actually goes to pay taxes has risen about five points. He blames lost deductions and higher rates -- the Sinicos are now in the 28 percent bracket.
Mr. Sinico supplements his salary from a small private school near Albany, by serving as zoning officer for West Sand Lake, N.Y., a town of 8,000 where he lives, and by working part-time as a tax preparer.
He is also trying to use his tax knowledge to reduce his family's tax burden. Much of his tax strategy centers on renovating the family home, a lakeside summer cottage that is almost 100 years old, so they can convert it to a rental property and take deductions for maintaining it and for depreciation.
The couple and their daughters, Katie, 10, and Elizabeth, 7, now live in the house. They expect to complete the project in late summer and to buy another house for themselves. If they do not convert their present home to a rental, they will sell it.
Two-and-a-half years ago, because of the phasing out of deductions for interest on consumer debt, the Sinicos consolidated their debts with a home equity loan, so their interest payments would continue to be fully deductible. The loan also financed the renovation.
"For middle-income people like ourselves, rental property is a way of saving money toward retirement or college costs," Mr. Sinico said. He anticipates depreciating the rental house and deducting operating costs from the income while building equity. He says he will eventually sell, perhaps when his income is lower or when capital gains are treated more favorably, or, alternatively, will borrow against the property.
Even if it is necessary to take out a loan for the girls' college costs, he said, if they "take an equity loan or a second mortgage on the rental property, those expenses can be taken as expenses against the rental income."
 Mr. Sinico is studying for a master's degree, which he hopes will not only lead to a higher income and possibly tenure, but also will make him eligible for an administrative job. He says that as a teacher without a master's degree, his age and experience are starting to work against him. Mrs. Sinico already has her master's degree.
"I've got quite a few years' experience, and I'm quite expensive for the position I have now," he said. "I'm competing against recent college graduates." In 1989 he spent four months at the end of the year without a teaching job and drew unemployment benefits, from which no tax was withheld. With his last quarter income down sharply, it was difficult to find the money to pay the taxes when they came came due.
"I didn't set anything aside," he said. "When you are used to getting a regular teacher's salary, and then start getting $265 a week, it's hard."
 They have been trying to invest $100 a month as a college reserve. The money is in a mutual fund where the dividends are routinely reinvested. But Mr. Sinico is disappointed with the returns and says he may shift the money to Series EE savings bonds. Under tax laws that became effective last year, the interest on Series EE bonds used for college expenses would be tax free in their case.

 
 
In Retirement
Facing Taxes Counterintuitively
 Beginning retirement with a 30-year mortgage on a new home while buying stocks and bonds with the proceeds from the sale of an old one may seem an unlikely strategy for a couple from the historically debt-shy Depression generation. But after studying recent changes in the tax laws, that is what Ellen and Jim Biggs, of Brevard, N.C., have done.
"There are very few tax shelters left," said Mrs. Biggs, 60 years old. "That's why we elected, instead of paying off our house, to have a mortgage, because the interest is a deduction. Mortgage interest and property taxes are about the only deductions left."
Over the years, she became the family bill payer and financial researcher. "I sort of like it," said Mrs. Biggs, who recently began using a personal financial program, Andrew Tobias's Managing Your Money, on her home computer to track income, investments and expenses in greater detail.
Five years ago she was half-owner of a bookstore and gift shop in their long-time home of Hickory, N.C. Her husband, then 59, had a one-man architectural practice. With their three children well-established in life, they began to study their retirement options. One of the first moves was to sell Mrs. Biggs's interest in the bookstore. "We were thinking about moving, and I had to clear the decks a little," she said.
They found a financial adviser at Legg, Mason, Wood, Walker, Inc., the Baltimore-based brokerage firm, who suggested they diversify their assets and move from growth-oriented stocks they had held many years to income-oriented investments.
Mrs. Biggs said they continue to rely on his advice, meeting with him in July and December to review everything, and now they have a regulated income and a comfortable level of contingency resources.
"We are constantly monitoring where we are," she said. "The approach is that we try to look at the tax benefits and get as much taxable income as we can and stay within the 15 percent bracket. We look to see how much we can earn and how much we can offset."
Selling their 70-year-old "barn of a house" in Hickory, as well as an adjacent piece of real estate, was a key move. They took the one-time capital gains tax exemption and invested the proceeds from the sale in a diverse portfolio, which includes high-yield stocks and tax-free bonds.
When they sold their house, they took a mortgage on a new home, a condominium in a retirement village in the southern Blue Ridge Mountains.
"Most of the people of my generation don't want a mortgage," said Mrs. Biggs. "They don't want debt. They want to own their home. Well, this is much better for us, we think."
 To prepare for retirement, Mr. Biggs reduced the level of his architectural practice substantially, but he keeps his professional credentials active and does some work from home. He is careful to avoid earnings that will cut into his Social Security benefits or move them out of the 15-percent tax bracket.
His Social Security check is used to pay the mortgage. The Biggs use credit cards sparingly and pay balances promptly to avoid consumer-interest debt. Their contingency fund includes a five-year annuity and their I.R.A.'s, which they haven't touched. Mrs. Biggs said those assets are for travel, home improvement or expenses in case of serious illness.
Like many people over 60, the Biggs are concerned about possible increases in the cost of living and about future health care expenses, but Mrs. Biggs said they feel fairly well protected. She researched nursing home insurance extensively, and even took out a policy on a 30-day trial basis, but she rejected it for the time being. She said they may look into it again in about 10 years. In the meantime, they consult their financial adviser and keep a sharp focus on their tax picture.

Turn Mideast Money Into U.S. Deposits

BYLINE: By LES DINKIN; Les Dinkin is managing partner of Les Dinkin & Associates, a financial services consulting firm in Westport, Conn.

 BODY:
The joke that has been going around since the war in the gulf began goes like this: Kuwait is a banking system without a country being defended by the United States, a country without a banking system. In large part, this is true. But together Kuwait and Saudi Arabia can help fix our banking and savings and loan mess.
Kuwait has an investment portfolio in excess of $100 billion. Add to this Saudi Arabia, with its own vast investments and cash reserves. In the United States, meanwhile, there is a savings and loan crisis that will cost taxpayers as much as $500 billion and a badly damaged banking system that could possibly drive the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Bank Insurance Fund into the red. 
 This situation brings to mind a not too immodest proposal. In exchange for cleaning up the current mess in the Middle East, let's have Saudi Arabia and Kuwait help us clean up our mess: our banking and savings and loan institutions.
The way they could do this is straightforward. Our banking and savings and loans institutions suffer from what some economists call a capital and liquidity crunch. So why not ask Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to deposit some of their billions in our banks and savings and loans? Why not ask them to help capitalize the F.D.I.C. or take a minority nonvoting equity positions in selected institutions, as Saudi Arabian Prince al-Waleed bin Talal said last week he would do with Citibank. These funds would be insured and safe and would earn them interest. But they would also provide us with mid- to longer-term stable funding sources.
Big deposits and new equity investment in the United States by these countries would take pressure off the F.D.I.C.'s insurance fund and encourage increased lending. With enough new capital in the system, interest rates might come down since there would be no need for shaky institutions to offer premium rates to win risk-averse depositors.
We don't have to ask Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to deposit all their money in the United States. My back-of-the-envelope calculation says we only need $200 billion to $300 billion to take the pressure off the American taxpayer and the F.D.I.C. Is that too much to ask? I don't think so.
Since President Bush has been passing the hat to get funding support for the war, why not pass some deposit slips as well? Come to think of it, why not pass some slips to the Japanese and Germans?
Given the aggressive promotions banks and savings and loans run to attract deposits, think of all the toasters, appliances and televisions the new depositors would receive.

HEADLINE: Managing;
Giving the Environment Teeth

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Last summer, the International Business Machines Corporation took a giant step backward -- on purpose.
Years earlier, it had decentralized responsibility for environmental matters. Then, on July 1, it appointed Arthur J. Hedge Jr., a corporate officer who had run the real estate and construction departments, to the new job of vice president of environmental health and safety. It gave him a staff of roughly 30 people culled from such disparate departments as real estate, personnel, legal and energy. And it charged the new group, which is based at I.B.M.'s Armonk, N.Y., headquarters, with insuring that corporate environmental policy is carried out. 
 "We needed one high-level group to focus our environmental efforts, and to send a clear signal that management cares about the environment," Mr. Hedge said.
I.B.M. is one of many companies that are upgrading the size, scope and status of their headquarters' environmental staffs. "Companies want people who can find the common thrust between technological, legal and public relations needs," said Bruce Piasecki, associate professor of environmental management at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.
They also want people who won't be cowed by plant managers who are more concerned with production than pollution. "Environmental people who report to someone above the plant manager are immune to politics," said William Alford, a New York recruiter who specializes in environmental jobs.
There are many reasons this is happening now. Companies still want to push decision-making as far down the line as possible. But they also want corporate-wide pollution control programs. They want environmental monitoring mechanisms that insurance underwriters will buy into. And they want to be sure that in a weak economy, headquarter's hands-off policies are not interpreted by plant managers as a go-ahead to press for profits instead of environmental compliance -- something particularly onerous at a time of nationwide environmental activism.
"The public has upped the ante, so we've upped the environmental function's clout," said Bruce W. Karrh, the Du Pont Company's vice president of safety, health and environmental affairs. Indeed, since 1987, Du Pont has increased the number of environmental jobs at Wilmington, Del., headquarters to 11 from 3, installed a more formal environmental audit process and tightened the criteria for joining the environmental staff.
Environment has a higher profile around the Polaroid Corporation's Cambridge, Mass., headquarters, too. Four years ago, Polaroid added a senior manager in manufacturing to control generation of toxic waste, and another in research, to see that new processes are environmentally sound. A few months ago, it added a senior marketing person to see that Polaroid products and packages do not cause a solid-waste problem.
 "What we are doing is incorporating environmental issues into the management system," said Harry Fatkin, Polaroid's director of health, safety and environmental affairs. Polaroid now is installing a complex auditing system that will check not only that plants are in compliance with environmental policies, but also that their management systems promote environmental and safety concerns.
Auditing certainly is getting special attention at the Ciba-Geigy Corporation's Ardsley, N.Y., headquarters. Two years ago, Ciba-Geigy put all of its environmental auditors into a stand-alone group that reports to the chief executive. "Just like you don't want financial auditors to audit their own bookkeeping, you don't want environmental auditors to judge their own technical decisions," said Joseph T. Sullivan, the senior vice president who oversees the group that helps the plant managers comply with environmental policies.
Apparently, the separation makes a difference. At one plant, the plant managers, the lawyers and the engineers all agreed on a particular solvent's safety. The environmental auditors disagreed -- and the plant people redesigned a process to eliminate the solvent.
"They figured if the internal auditors weren't satisfied, the external auditors probably wouldn't be -- and neither would the C.E.O.," Mr. Sullivan said.

 
 
WHEN THE BOSS GETS INVOLVED
 Sometimes, one word from the chairman can be worth a thousand words from the next level down.
Just ask Bruce W. Karrh, the Du Pont Company's vice president of safety, health and environmental affairs. As a Du Pont officer, Mr. Karrh, who has run the company's environmental operations since 1984, is a honcho in his own right. Even so, plant managers often balked when he advised them to commit resources to environmental projects.
Then, in May 1989, Du Pont's chairman, Edgar S. Woolard Jr., called for "corporate environmentalism" and dubbed himself Du Pont's "chief environmentalist." All of a sudden, plant people were begging Mr. Kharr for environmental advice.
"I used to have to do a real selling job to the line people," Mr. Karrh said. "Then suddenly it wasn't just me trying to get the organization to do things, it was Ed. Now they call all the time."
Ciba-Geigy, too, is putting a visible, top-level imprimatur on environmentalism. In January, it established a "governance committee" of the board of directors, responsible for overseeing any issue that affects the company's reputation. The committee, led by Ciba's chairman, Richard Barth, is looking at environmental issues first.
"We want to insure a common understanding of our expectations throughout the company," said Joseph T. Sullivan, a senior vice president and a committee member.

HEADLINE: FORUM;
The Indivisibility of Ethics

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. MYERS; There is a sharp division within the nation's business schools about how ethics should be taught. In a Dec. 23 article on the Forum page, Edward J. Conry, a professor in the College of Business Administration, argued that special courses in business law and ethics should be required of all business students. In the following article, Robert J. Myers, president of the Carnegie Council on Ethics and International Affairs, argues there is no separate set of ethics for business.

 BODY:
 In 1981, Peter F. Drucker wrote "What Is 'Business Ethics?' " In that article, he said: "There is only one ethics, one set of rules of morality, one code: that of individual behavior in which the same rules apply to everyone alike." Mr. Drucker attributed this conclusion to a long tradition of Western and Eastern philosophers. That should have laid the question to rest. It did not.
The debate over business ethics seems particularly relevant as one looks over some of the recent literature on the subject. First, there is Research Report No. 900 from the Conference Board on "Corporate Ethics," an international survey and collection of interviews that examine how 200 companies "define ethical issues, respond to ethical dilemmas, develop and communicate codes of ethics, design ethics training programs."
Another Conference Board publication starts out: "Unless ethical considerations are a part of every manager's thought process, both the corporation and individual executives will fail to exercise the level of responsibility which good business represents and the law demands." It is the phrase "both the corporation and individual executives" that highlights the so-far perennial problem for "business ethics," opening as it does a dual standard of ethics.
Executives need to know that they are not alone in an uncharted ethical jungle. Nor do they single-handedly have to invent ethics. Further, they are not required to build a unique ethical system, applicable only to their own business. Yet this is what one senses when looking through the popular "codes of conduct" that hundreds of American companies have felt compelled to establish as modern, concerned corporate citizens.
The claim that there is a separate set of standards for the action of a responsible executive in his or her corporate capacity, as opposed to personal capacity, has been discussed in different ways over the centuries. This notion first surfaces in the concept of a dual standard between one's actions as an individual and in a public or state role. An early example is seen in "The Prince," in which Machiavelli advocated no restraint on the part of the ruler, although cautioning the Prince to conceal this side of his character from the public. In the last century, the Italian statesman Conte Camillo Benso di Cavour, considering his role and those of his colleagues in the unification of Italy, put the matter succinctly: "If we had done for ourselves what we have done for Italy, what scoundrels we would have been."
The pernicious contemporary result of this thinking is the acceptance by the corporate community that the corporate code is inferior to the private code. This unnecessary burden can be happily abandoned by following Mr. Drucker's "one code" idea. Otherwise, criticism of corporations on ethical grounds will continue.
While change is a given in our society, and ethics is not immune from that process, the locus of ethics remains in the individual. No amount of economic or sociological hocus-pocus will alter that. Corporations and other institutions will not be relieved of their clear-eyed responsibility to hew to a single ethical standard. Executives can try to operate behind legal and other fig leaves, but in the end, they are still Adam and Eve standing blushingly before judgment.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Operating Systems for PC's Grow More Confusing

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
Reports that the OS/2 operating system is dead are greatly exaggerated, officials of the Microsoft Corporation and the International Business Machines Corporation say. Yet there appears to be a great deal of confusion about the future of OS/2 -- and about the future of personal computer operating systems in general.
The confusion stems in part from the decision late last year by Microsoft and I.B.M., which had collaborated to develop the industry-standard DOS operating system, to part company on the developmental responsibilities for operating systems. 
 The two companies have long agreed that the original DOS system they rode to fortune is about ready for pasture. DOS is a decade old, and advances in computer technology and software applications have rendered it too feeble to meet the needs of today's complex business computing systems. OS/2 can run several programs at once (a process called multitasking) and it breaks the 640-kilobyte memory limit of DOS.
 I.B.M. and Microsoft still see OS/2, or something very much like it, as the eventual successor to DOS. But if they are heading toward a similar destination, they have chosen different paths to get there. And they may each come up with a slightly different form of OS/2, one with the "look and feel" of Microsoft's Windows, the other with I.B.M.'s preferred interface called Presentation Manager. "There would be just enough incompatilities to confuse users and cause them to pull their hair out," said John McCarthy, a senior analyst with Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass.
Presentation Manager, like Windows, is a graphical shell that hides the complexities of the operating system behind a control panel of symbols, scroll bars, menus and windows. Although Windows and P.M. are very similar, someone running OS/2 with Presentation Manager would not be able to use Windows-based software, and vice versa.
I.B.M. officials rather lamely say the divergence reflects a logistical problem -- that it was hard to collaborate when Microsoft's programmers were in Redmond, Wash., while I.B.M.'s were in Boca Raton, Fla., and England. Microsoft was somewhat more candid: "Microsoft systems strategy has changed over time," the company said, implying that "I.B.M.'s has not." What changed Microsoft's strategy was the phenomenal and apparently unexpected success of Windows, its graphical front-end to DOS.
 OS/2 was announced with fanfare nearly four years ago as the eventual replacement for DOS. I.B.M. was so keen on OS/2 that it named its entire family of personal computers PS/2, in a clear effort to make customers think that the hardware and software went hand in hand. Microsoft obviously believed that OS/2 was the future, too.
To say that I.B.M. and Microsoft overestimated the OS/2 market is an enormous understatement. Total sales of OS/2 to date are about 300,000 copies, and Microsoft says it is selling 150,000 copies a year. In contrast, Microsoft said last month that it will sell 15 million copies of DOS this year -- outselling OS/2 by a neat 100-to-1 margin -- on top of an installed base of 60 million DOS computers.
But the coup de grace for OS/2 as a desktop operating system -- rather than a network server system, where it has been been successful -- has come from Windows 3.0. That program has sold three million copies between its introduction in May 1990 and the end of the year. Microsoft expects to sell six million copies of Windows in 1991, company officials say.
"Try as it might, and as big as it is, Microsoft does not control events in the computer industry," said Marshall L. Moseley, software analyst for Dataquest Inc., a market research company in San Jose, Calif. "It moves with the economy and with events that no one can predict."
Business customers are saying loud and clear that they want Windows on their desktop computers, not OS/2, and Microsoft shifted its strategy accordingly, much to I.B.M.'s consternation. I.B.M. had promised its customers that OS/2 and its Windows-like Presentation Manager would prevail. Without Microsoft's full support, that promise now sounds hollow.
I.B.M. continues to put its broad shoulders behind OS/2 and Presentation Manager. Microsoft is throwing its developmental weight behind DOS and Windows, including a so-called Win32 that will take full advantage of the Intel Corporation's 80386 and 80486 microprocessors, which process data in chunks of 32 bits. (The current Windows is a 16-bit system, designed to run on the 16-bit Intel 80286 chip.)
At the same time, Microsoft disclosed plans for an intriguing operating system called NTOS, for New Technology Operating System, which includes a core operating code that analysts say is what Microsoft used to call OS/2 3.0. Like OS/2, the NT kernel described by Microsoft is envisioned for high-end personal computers.
First, it is "portable," meaning it can work on virtually any computer. Second, the NT kernel will have the ability to work with a variety of software application interfaces, including Windows and Presentation Manager. Third, the NT operating system is said to incorporate advanced data security features, multitasking, the ability to work with multiple processors and a technique called disk mirroring, which means the system automatically backs itself up.
Microsoft said NT would be released to software developers by year-end. I.B.M. continues to work on its own versions of OS/2, including the first 32-bit OS/2, called OS/2 2.0, which is also expected late this year.
 Just to complicate things, reports are surfacing that the Compaq Computer Corporation, the Digital Equipment Corporation and MIPS Computer Systems Inc., among others, are plotting to support a new processor standard for advanced computers, based on the MIPS R4000 RISC processor. Santa Cruz Operations Inc. would develop a version of the Unix operating system for such computers, but -- surprise -- it could also run Microsoft's NTOS.
 The Go Corporation of Foster City, Calif., meanwhile, is working on an operating system for computers that use pens instead of keyboards. And Apple Computer Inc. is preparing to release its long-awaited System 7.0 Macintosh operating system.
"For most users, a lot of this is meaningless," said Mr. McCarthy of Forrester. "The standalone PC users will be more than content with Windows 3.0 and the extensions Microsoft has done there. Where DOS is ultimately going to fall on its face is in network-intensive applications where you have a lot of communications going on between the desktop and multiple servers, the high-end, mission-critical systems where you need real multitasking. Those are the people who are most affected by all this waffling and battling between I.B.M. and Microsoft."

HEADLINE: Furor in Japan Over U.S. Funding Program

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 2

 BODY:
At the height of frictions with the United States last year, Japan created an ambitious new $375 million Government-financed endowment to support scholarly, political and cultural exchanges between the two countries.
But now as the new venture is about to begin, an unusual controversy has arisen, with warnings by American foundation executives and scholars that the fund might backfire by being seen as a costly attempt to improve Japan's public relations reputation in the United States. To Japanese and Americans alike, the controversy reflects the tense state of relations these days, aggravated by endless trade disputes and American resentments over Japanese investments and what many officials see as Tokyo's half-hearted response to the war against Iraq. 
 "Apparently the Japanese Government has become a kind of leper, with everything it approaches being seen as smeared," said an irritated former Japanese diplomat involved in the creation of the new fund. "Why can't the Government of Japan be seen as sincerely wanting to do good deeds?"
Japanese officials praise the fund as a brilliant idea that won high-level political backing when it was proposed by Shintaro Abe, an influential former Foreign Minister who is now ailing.
The fund endowment is to generate about $30 million annually for a variety of exchanges between Japanese and American scholars, particularly "grass roots" officials, journalists and other specialists who would explore common problems in the two countries. Among the subjects to be examined are the environment, economic tensions, politics and social problems.
In a recent symposium to discuss the establishment of the fund, American scholars and foundation representatives expressed enthusiasm, saying it could supplement much of the support for scholarly research on Japan and United States-Japan relations.
But they also warned Foreign Ministry officials that because of the current climate in the United States, such studies would be seen as tainted if they were sponsored by a unit dominated by the Government. These Americans urged that the new Global Partnership Center be freed of all Government ties.
One of the strongest warnings came from a vice president of the Ford Foundation, Susan V. Berresford, who said in a speech at the symposium that "many knowledgeable people" were concerned that the fund would "set U.S.-Japanese relations back rather than advance them."
"I will be very candid," she went on. "They fear that it will be set up and run with the express purpose of polishing the Japanese image rather than being a legitimate philanthropy in the U.S. tradition."
The suggestion, echoed by several others, has in turn irked Japanese officials, who argue that because the new fund is backed by taxpayers' money, it would be accountable to some degree.
"The fund will be very independent," said Kazuo Ogura, director general of cultural affairs at the Foreign Ministry. "We want it to do new things, and to be imaginative, creative and perhaps even controversial."
But he added that an overly independent fund might "strike out a certain independent, individualistic, unorthodox or controversial policy" unacceptable to the Government. "The fund will have to strike a balance," he said.
Others involved with the fund said that a "tug of war" was under way in the Foreign Ministry, with various consuls general of Japan in the United States seeking authority to give grants to groups in their communities to improve Japanese relations.
"Much of Japanese corporate money and Government money is, bluntly speaking, P.R. oriented," said Tadashi Yamamoto, president of the Japan Center for International Exchange. "There's very little money on the Japanese side for substantive policy-oriented intellectual joint studies."
Another Japanese official promised that the fund would have an "advisory council" to insure that "we can have American ideas and American suggestions for our activities." But he said that the power of the advisory council had not yet been determined.

HEADLINE: Applications to Medical Schools Rise Steeply

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The number of applications for admission to medical schools, which declined steadily through most of the 1980's, is up sharply this year. The increase is apparently a result of students' search for safe careers in the midst of recession, aggressive recruiting by medical colleges and the schools' efforts to make themselves appear less forbidding to liberal arts majors.
More than 33,600 students have applied for 16,000 spots in the nation's 126 accredited medical schools next fall, according to a memorandum sent to medical college admissions officers in February by the Association of American Medical Colleges. 
 That number of applicants is still more than 3,000 below the number recorded in 1981, when the decline began. But it is 15 percent above the 29,243 of last year and marks the third straight year in which there has been at least some increase.
The number fell to 26,721 in 1988 from 36,727 in 1981. It increased in 1989 and again in 1990, but by nothing approaching the large gains being witnessed at many schools for next fall.
Applications are up more than 28 percent at the University of Michigan and Ohio State University, 27 percent at Northwestern University, 24 percent at the University of Southern California, 23 percent at Baylor University, 22 percent at Vanderbilt University and 17 percent at Johns Hopkins University.
 
Reasons for Upturn

Admissions officers at the medical schools see a number of reasons for the sharp upturn. One is the economy.
During the 1980's, highly qualified students flocked in record numbers to law schools and business schools, lured in part by visions of quick fortunes on Wall Street.
The images associated with medical colleges were more negative: many years of study, tens of thousands of dollars in student debt, and malpractice lawsuits.
The negatives remain. Eighty-one percent of medical students incur debt, averaging more than $42,000 a student. And it still takes 7 to 10 years of study and clinical training to enter the profession.
But some admissions deans now say as Leibert Morris of Ohio State University's School of Medicine put it, that "the negatives are losing their shock value." With illness an inherent part of the human condition, some top students tend to view the medical field as a safer bet than business or law in a recession, several deans said.
Dr. Norman Anderson, dean of admissions at Johns Hopkins, said he was seeing unusually large numbers of older applicants and people changing careers. "This year," he said, "there were a large number of people released from jobs in investment banking and business. I've had more lawyers apply now than I've ever seen. My guesstimate is we have 20 this year."
Others point to recent efforts to make medical schools less forbidding to liberal arts majors.
"Medical colleges are stressing that science is no longer the end-all," said Dr. Louis J. Kettel, vice president for academic affairs at the Association of American Medical Colleges. "There's lots of room for the humanist."
In one sign of such openness, prospective medical students in April will take a drastically revised Medical College Admissions Test, which for the first time will emphasize problem solving more than pure science.
Aggressive recruiting is also paying off for some schools.
Zen Camacho, Baylor's dean of admissions, said he and other medical school officials were doing more traveling than ever to colleges and high schools to persuade students that medicine was worth the hard work.
And the American Medical Association has been campaigning to get doctors to be less negative when asked whether they would recommend careers in medicine.
"There's no question that you can't just sweep the negatives away," said Dr. Kettel. "But we ask students in questionnaires if they understand the problems, and they seem to be saying, 'Yes, but we're here anyway.' "

HEADLINE: A Cautionary Note on Africa

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a black African I was more than delighted to see that an article about the future of the continent was given space ("Afterward, Make Africa a Priority," Feb. 3).
In the piece, Salim Lone, a Kenyan, argues that after the current American engagement in the Persian Gulf is over, the industrialized Western countries must help Africa cope with its economic problems by offering massive "debt relief and easier terms for receiving aid." Furthermore, Mr. Lone advises the West not to spend more of its expertise and resources on Eastern Europe where the collapse of Communism paved the way for private investment.
With all due respect, I strongly disagree on both accounts. First, while Africa was busy getting close to $230 billion in loans and credit in the past 30 years, which marked the rise of the new African states from the era of European colonialism, the Eastern European countries that were forced into the Warsaw Pact by the Red Army weren't getting any sort of significant assistance from the West. "In the 1980's," writes Jennifer Whitaker in her book "How Can Africa Survive," "Africans, who are about 12 percent of the developing world's population, were receiving about 22 percent of the total aid and the share per person was higher than anywhere else in the third world."
Now that there has been democratic change in Eastern European nations, it is in the interest of the West that massive assistance, both private and public, be given to them so they can develop a free market economy with a stable middle class.
Africans, like yesteryear's East Europeans, need to get rid of their corrupted dictators who more often than not run the state for the benefit of one man, his family and his tribe. The West should not fall for the eloquent speeches delivered by Africa's 40-plus dictators who all of a sudden celebrate the virtue of free-market capitalism and the failure of centrally planned economic systems. They hadn't read Karl Marx's "Das Kapital" when they were with the Soviets and their new conversion to the market is not based on an understanding of Adam Smith's "Wealth of Nations." They say whatever the donor countries with the most funds wish to hear.
Unless Africa experiences an Easternn European-style revolution, no amount of debt relief and aid will be enough to solve its economic misery.

HEADLINE: Account of Failure: Talks at The News

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
While management of The Daily News and its striking unions share blame for the failure of their negotiations, that failure was from the beginning a likely, if not inevitable, outcome of the strategy of the paper's owner, the Tribune Company of Chicago.
 The fact that the Tribune Company could afford to let the talks fail, indeed could benefit overall as a company by letting The News go out of business after 71 years of publication, was its underlying strength in extended bargaining with the paper's nine unions. 
 But if the company thought this strength would bring the unions around to accepting drastic changes that News management said were necessary to continue operation of the paper, it miscalculated in a large and repeated way.
In a bruising but often subtle duel extending nearly two years, both sides thrust and parried, until Thursday evening when negotiations were declared effectively ended. The News has said that a buyer must be found by March 20 or the paper will be closed.
 
Profit or Loss
 There were about a dozen moments during the negotiations that proved particularly significant.
The first and most important was the policy decision made sometime in 1989 by Charles T. Brumback, the combative man who had become president of the Tribune Company on that Jan. 1, to shed The News unless it could quickly be turned into a money maker.
Mr. Brumback began telling associates he was determined to "win back the franchise" from wasteful and abusive union control by negotiating a radically different contract to replace the one that was to expire on March 30, 1990. Tribune executives say The News lost $115 million in the 1980's.
From the start, the Tribune Company's stated objective was to establish "management rights," which the company said were essential to stop feather-bedding and unnecessary overtime so that the paper, could be made profitable. For instance, with a management rights contract, management would have been able to decide how many people should operate a press in all situations, even though such issues had been previously controlled by staffing levels negotiated with unions.
 
No Ground Surrendered
 Union leaders regarded the management rights concept as unconditional surrender of their power at The News and tantamount to union busting. While union leaders said they were willing to reduce the work force and make other economic concessions, they resolved to do so only within the framework of a traditional contract that would preserve union power in the work place.
Neither side ever gave any significant ground.
The great power of the Tribune Company throughout the negotiations has been that, while the unions had everything to lose, the Tribune Company had nothing to lose except incurring the onus of closing one of the nation's best-known newspapers.
Since The News became unprofitable in the early 1980's, the paper has been a drag on the company's corporate earnings, which include profits from The Chicago Tribune and other papers and broadcast properties.
With its bargaining approach, The Tribune Company stood to gain a profitable paper operated with the efficiencies of management rights, or by closing or selling the paper, to improve corporate profits in a different manner.
To the unions, the Tribune Company effectively took the paper hostage.
 
'Reform Is the Word'
 "If they couldn't beat up the unions, they'd shut it down," George E. McDonald, president of the Allied Printing Trades Council which includes all of the striking unions, said on Friday.
"Reform is the word I like to use," said James Hoge, publisher of The News, characterizing what the paper had sought from its unions. "I don't think we created the confrontation."
In the summer of 1989, the decision having been made to revolutionize The News's work place or abandon the franchise, Mr. Hoge began to execute the company's public relations strategy.
One significant element of the plan was to win the hearts and minds of New Yorkers by exposing abusive union work practices, especially in the two unions considered the worst offenders: the Newspaper and Mail Deliverers Union of New York and New York Newspaper Printing Pressmen's Union Local 2 -- the drivers and the pressmen.
Mr. Hoge made his case in an interview in Vanity Fair magazine that fall, but the article had the additional effect of alerting unions to the company's strategy, which was to isolate the drivers and the pressmen from the other unions and break union solidarity.
Forewarned, the unions began planning a strategy of their own, whose cornerstone was maintaining solidarity.
 
Lawyer's Significance
 Later that fall, with actual negotiations about to start, Mr. Hoge announced that Robert Ballow would represent the company in the talks. To the unions, that was comparable to declaring that there would be no quarter. Mr. Ballow, a lawyer based in Nashville, is known within the newspaper industry for his very aggressive bargaining, which often has gained dramatic union concessions.
The Tribune Company fully understood the significance of hiring Mr. Ballow. In 1982, when the company had tried to sell the paper, the publisher W. Dean Singleton, who represented a prospective buyer, Joe L. Allbritton, said he wanted Mr. Ballow to represent Mr. Allbritton in negotiations with unions. But Mr. Singleton said the Tribune Company forbade it. The reason the company gave, he said: the unions would consider hiring Mr. Ballow "inflammatory."
The significant moment came when the contract expired last March 30. Negotiations had gone nowhere, and executives at The News, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the company hoped -- and expected -- all or part of the 2,300 union members to strike.
 
Trying to Avoid a Strike
 The News wanted a strike because it would allow the paper to hire permanent replacements for striking workers, and the new employees would work under a management rights arrangement.
But union leaders, who were now being counseled by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., decided that it was in their best interest not to strike and their members continued to work as negotiations ground on.
The next significant moment came in late March when The News offered to raise salaries of its largest union, the Newspaper Guild, by about 30 percent over three years. Executives involved with the management strategy who spoke on the basis of anonymity said The News considered such an offer all but irresistible and expected the Guild to break with the other unions.
But it was another miscalculation. The offer would have stripped Guild members of the job security that they valued even more highly than the salary increase, and the union's leaders rejected the proposal without significant dissent from members.
 
Dispute in Mail Room
 By June, the unions were engaged in a strategy of prolonging negotiations in an effort to prevent The News from declaring an impasse, which would be followed by imposing the new managment rights policy, something that they expected would prompt a strike and open the door to permanent replacements.
News executives who spoke on condition of anonymity said that, throughout the spring, some members of the management team who had questioned the wisdom of Mr. Ballow's confrontational style of negotiating were quietly pushed out. They were replaced, in many cases, by executives from other Tribune papers who had been through other strikes and shared the tough, can-do attitude that now permeated the paper's top ranks.
In late October, a group of drivers left their posts in a dispute in the mail room. The News quickly replaced them and said the next day that they had been permanently replaced. The drivers union then walked out, and the other unions struck in sympathy.
The News's careful preparation made it possible to print the paper with replacement workers, and a cadre of replacement drivers and security workers successfully got trucks loaded with The News from the plants to the street.
But once again, News management had badly miscalculated by assuming that news dealers would support the paper in such a situation.
 
Absence of Advertisers
 Faced with a combination pro-union sentiment, outright violence and threats of additional violence, most newsstands in New York refused to sell The News. Circulation dropped precipitously, which made the paper less attractive to advertisers, who were under pressure from unions to withdraw their ads.
In mid-November, the paper's advertisers abandoned it in a rush, and The News was left almost without revenue.
The News filed several lawsuits, including ones charging union racketeering, and the unions filed countersuits. The News also tried selling the paper through street hawkers.
But the unions had shut it down as a business.
By Jan. 1, the paper said it was losing $750,000 a day.
On Jan. 16, Mr. Hoge announced that such losses could not be sustained and that the Tribune Company would close the paper or sell it by March 20 if no settlement could be reached with unions.
Unhappily for the paper's unions, the stock market reacted to the news that the paper might be closed with an 8 percent increase in the price of Tribune Company stock on that day. Last Friday, Tribune stock closed at $42 a share, 21 percent higher than the price before the Jan. 16 announcement.
There was a brief flicker of hope among union officials that the Tribune Company might soften its position when Bill Usery Jr., a former Secretary of Labor who is respected by unions, was brought in by The News to try to mediate.
 
Ballow Continues
 In the first face-to-face meeting during the negotiations between Mr. Hoge and Mr. Brumback and the union leaders, the company's message was that it wanted to save the situation.
But Mr. McDonald said that, had The News been serious, it would have replaced Mr. Ballow as the chief negotiator. Instead, Mr. Ballow continued to direct the negotiations, though Mr. Hoge was present. Though there were some changes and a relaxation of some of the management rights language, union leaders considered such maneuvers merely an effort to build a record to help the company in existing and future lawsuits after the paper was closed.
In turn, Mr. Hoge said the changes were from a sincere effort to reach agreement. In negotiations with the pressmen's union, which had been selected as the lead union in the mediation, The News offered to negotiate the number of people needed to operate presses in the traditional fashion. But The News demanded a 50 percent work force reduction and a 45 percent pay cut for most of the remaining workers. The offer was rejected, with the president of the Newspaper Guild, Barry F. Lipton, calling it a "suicide proposal" that "was made to be rejected."
On Thursday, at a final mediation session, The News and the pressmen once again failed to come to terms, and Mr. Usery announced that further negotiations were a waste of time.
Mr. McDonald said one of the few silver linings for unions in the current situation is their expectation that Mr. Ballow's reputation would suffer because his confrontational approachdid not win the concessions that the Tribune Company expected and cost it a small fortune.
Mr. Hoge said that, from the beginning of 1990 to the present, the paper's losses have been over $130 million, much of it related to the labor conflict. He added that he considered Mr. Ballow's work to have been excellent.
"I don't cast blame on anyone," he said.

HEADLINE: Record $4.4 Million Raised for Neediest Cases

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ

 BODY:
Despite war and a declining economy, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund last week completed its most successful campaign in its 79-year history.
While the 1990-91 appeal opened in November to dire predictions of "compassion fatigue" among New Yorkers, the drive ended with thousands of contributors' sending money to help the sick and the poor. Many did so even in the face of salary cuts, job layoffs and the city's fiscal crisis. 
 Some fund-raising experts say that the campaign's achievements reflect a general trend in charitable giving: Hard times lead to an increase in the number of donors.
The 1990-91 appeal for the Neediest Cases raised $4,439,093.47 from at least 15,580 people and organizations. The fund's total is up $66,810.25 from last year, and it received about 1,300 more gifts than in the previous drive.
 
Annual Testimony to Generosity
 The 1990-91 appeal ended on Thursday, though donations will continue to be accepted throughout the year and be recorded in the next campaign, beginning in late November. All the money goes to seven charities that aid the needy, as The New York Times pays for the fund's administrative costs.
Since it was established in 1912 by The Times's publisher, Adolph S. Ochs, the fund has provided annual testimony to the generosity of New Yorkers. Over the years, it has has grown steadily from its initial appeal, which received 117 gifts totaling $3,630.88. The $1 million mark was passed in the 1970-71 campaign, the fund's annual total broke $2 million in the 1983-84 campaign and the proceeds increased for much of the 1980's.
Though the fund's amount had increased in the five previous campaigns, fund administrators had not been hopeful about the chances for a record this time around.
 
'Appreciate the Compassion'
 "When the fund started its annual appeal last November, no one connected with the drive held any hope of matching last season's solid record," said Arthur Gelb, the president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund. "The fact that we ended ahead of last year despite such difficult times is a tribute to the loyal, caring readers of The Times.
"All of us at the fund and those at its benefiting charities appreciate the compassion and generosity of everyone who gave."
This generosity, however, was not restricted to the Neediest Cases. Similar charities sponsored by newspapers, including those of The Washington Post, The San Francisco Chronicle and New York Newsday, reported increases in their holiday appeals. In New York, a number of other charities reported that their latest fund-raising efforts had come out ahead of their previous ones in both the amount and number of donations. And several fund-raising experts said that the percentage of people giving to charities had increased over the last few years.
"Even though some people are hard pressed because of the recession, a lot more people are giving," said Jimmie R. Alford, the chairman of the Trust for Philanthropy of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel. "More and more people are aware of the different charities out there, and although times are tough, they're finding ways to support them -- especially the ones that serve the basic human needs."
 
Expert Doubts General Increase
 But Lester Salamon, an expert on philanthropic giving and the director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Policy Studies, disagreed. He said that there was no evidence of a significant increase in giving this year and that past trends suggested a recession would hurt donations. He noted that the increase in this year's total for the Neediest Cases was substantially less than the growth in previous years.
As in previous campaigns, the 1990-91 Neediest Cases drive continued to attract a wide variety of donors: millionaire movie stars, elderly people on Social Security and children who received a weekly allowance of 50 cents. Contributions came from as far as Hong Kong, Israel, Switzerland and France as well as from Connecticut, New Jersey and New York. The donations' amounts ranged from two checks for $150,000 each from the Starr Foundation in Manhattan and Paul Newman's food company to a $1 bill sent anonymously.
But this year seemed different in the number of contributors who wrote that they were giving to the fund despite losing their jobs or or suffering a drop in their income.
Judith S. Hull, a 42-year-old architectural history scholar in Oak Park, Ill., has been unemployed for several years because of an illness. But this year, she and her husband felt it was important to send a donation to the fund, their first in many years.
"We are not yet out of the woods and hesitate to send the check as the banking crisis continues," she wrote. "But where will we all be if conditions in our greatest city decline further? Perhaps for me, this is some kind of investment in a place where I studied and learned so much."
Another donor, who did not want her name published, sent $1,250 and wrote: "Economic adversity has caused a significant drop in my income this year. Nevertheless, I am privileged compared to many New Yorkers, so once again I am increasing my contribution."
The $500 gift from Robert and Lynn Mueller of Manhattan came with a brief note: "While the amount is not as much as it has been in recent years, we feel that it is important to continue to give. It is an unfortunate irony that in the years when people need the most help, there may be less to give."

HEADLINE: Scraping By, Illegally, Mining Kentucky Coal

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BARBOURVILLE, Ky.

 BODY:
This part of southeastern Kentucky is so poor with so few ways to make an honest living, that many people do not even try. The last time state officials counted they found that fewer than half the adults in Knox County were working.
"We're a mailbox economy," said Phillip Connley, the Mayor of Barbourville, referring to the monthly arrival of welfare and pension checks. "Everybody gets checks." 
 But one thing that Knox County has in abundance is people who know coal mining. Many worked for coal companies until mechanization put them out of their jobs, and some still earn a living as "wildcatters," by mining illegally. Because of a glittering seam of uncommonly rich coal known as the Blue Gem -- coal that is hard for the big mining companies to get at -- the Cumberland Mountain land around Barbourville is the nation's center of wildcat mining.
Concerned about the risk of deaths and goaded by lawful operators, the United Mine Workers of America and environmentalists, Federal and state regulators have stepped up pursuit of these miners.
Edward Hugler, deputy administrator of the Mine Safety and Health Administration in Washington and chief of the agency's two-year-old study group on illegal mining, said regulators had cut down the activity. But he added that new wildcat mines had opened and that if depressed coal prices rebounded, there would probably be more.
Wildcat miners fatten their profits by skirting safety and land use regulations, taxes and other government-imposed constraints. Because of this, they infuriate unions and law-abiding mining companies. But that type of lawlessness also evokes romance and admiration in Appalachia.
"Like moonshiners, these people are trying to make a living," said Tom Duncan, who retired in December as president of the Kentucky Coal Association, an industry group.
"Some of them are thieves," who pillage coal from others' land, he said. "But some mine the coal because it's theirs, it's on their territory."
 
A Bankrupt Wildcatter
 One wildcatter who got caught is Ray Phipps, who lives in a rundown trailer in a hollow near Barbourville, a town of about 3,000 people and the seat of Knox County.
In the last decade Mr. Phipps, now 45 years old, became a big wildcatter, burrowing into the hills on hundreds of acres that his father had bought over the years. With a crew of up to 17 miners who shared in the profits, he mined 90 tons of Blue Gem coal a day and made a comfortable living.
But Mr. Phipps caught the eye of the Kentucky Department of Surface Mining by operating without permits and leaving the area around his mines in a chaos of slate and shale that he had dragged out with the coal.
He said he was ordered to restore the land he had defaced or pay a fine of $250,000. He could not afford either, he said, so he closed the business and filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Phipps said he planned to leave the Cumberlands and go to Georgia to look for a factory job.
"You realize the country you live in is not hardly free," he said. "They're running me out. If you want, you can take a bulldozer and tear these mountains all to hell -- just so you don't take any coal."
Like Mr. Phipps, many people here look for illegal ways to make money because the government, the economy and the business establishment have provided few alternatives.
Southeastern Kentucky has had little success in luring new industry or in teaching the young new skills. And the big coal companies here have found they can dig more coal faster by replacing people with machines.
Last year an average of 9,959 Knox County residents received food stamps each month, in a population of 29,643. And, in the depths of the recession, crimes like shoplifting and drunken driving are soaring.
 
'Theft Is Up the Most'
 "Theft is up the most," said Officer Bill D. Swafford of the Barbourville police. "We've got people who, if they knew there was a nickel on the table in your house, they would break in to get it."
Kentucky, the nation's second largest coal producer after Wyoming, enjoyed a period of relative prosperity in the late 1970's, when coal prices rose with oil prices and many utilities converted their power plants from oil to coal.
But with the mechanization of mining, the jobs withered away even as production soared. In Knox County, the number of jobs in legitimate mining plunged to 242 last year from 717 in 1985. Jobs in businesses that cater to mining have disappeared with them.
"In the 70's you saw new ranch-style homes, new trailers and satellite dishes, those metal ears in the ground," said John Stephenson, president of Berea College, a private liberal arts college just north of the coal country. "Now you see peeling paint and people moving."
After growing in the 1970's, the population of Knox County declined by 2 percent in the 1980's. Among the people who stay, many work in low-wage fast-food and discount stores. But others, and the people they hire, find richer rewards outside the law.
Some grow marijuana. Robert Trevey, an Assistant United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Kentucky, in Lexington, called Kentucky the nation's third largest marijuana producer, after California and Hawaii. And both of those states have year-round growing seasons.
"Marijuana wiped out moonshine," said Lowell W. Lundy, a Barbourville lawyer. "It's much more profitable."
But in dry counties like Knox, people continue to bootleg. "It's usually a family business," Officer Swafford said. "It passes from father to son."
And they wildcat. Joseph Garcia, manager of the Mine Safety and Health Administration's office in Barbourville, which oversees mining in Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama, said 43 active unlawful mines, defined as those working without official sanction, were uncovered in the three states over the last two years. Eleven were in Knox County, he said, and 10 were in neighboring Whitley County.
 
Few Convictions, Fewer Jailed
 The mine safety agency, which is part of the Federal Department of Labor, wants to close wildcat mines because of the danger they pose to workers. But people who sympathize with the wildcatters say fatal accidents are rare because most wildcatters are cautious, even if they skirt regulations. They themselves work in the mines, unlike the managers of big coal companies, and the crews are often made up of family members.
Convictions are hard to obtain because of sympathetic juries. Of 66 wildcat mines found nationwide over the last two years, Mr. Hugler said, in only one case have people been sent to prison -- two Kentucky men for four months.
Officials of the mine safety agency say they have no way of knowing how many mines are starting up until they see the signs of one -- a new dirt road up a remote hill or coal being hauled along back roads.
On a recent day in February, Federal investigators near Barbourville saw two trucks loaded with coal that aroused their suspicion. Mining inspectors have no authority to stop vehicles on public roads, so they hurried to the office shack of a nearby mine, where the tiny, legitimate Gideon Coal Company is working the Blue Gem Seam.
Vernon Morris, the manager of the mine, said the investigators asked if the trucks had come from his mine. Only one, he said he told them, and he knew of no other mines along the road. But with more coal leaving the area than Gideon is producing, it appeared that a wildcatter had taken another hill.
 
A Shallow Shelf of Wealth
 The Blue Gem Seam, a shelf of coal that cuts through the hills and hollows of Knox and Whitley counties, is favored by wildcatters as well as by small legitimate operators because it is too shallow, at 18 to 30 inches thick, to accommodate the heavy machinery used by big coal companies.
Because Blue Gem coal contains little sulfur, it creates little pollution. Big mining companies and coal brokers pay about $32 a ton for it, $8 of $10 more than for most coal. It is illegal to buy wildcat coal, but miners can disguise its origin.
For an illegal operator, wildcat mining is a fairly cheap business to enter. He borrows or rents a bulldozer to prepare the face of the mine, and he usually buys a tractor and scoop.
And wildcatters avoid many other costs. Lawful operators spend about $10,000 for engineering studies, and thousands of dollars more for special bolts to secure the roof of a mine. They also have to put a lot of money in escrow with the state, money that they get back only after they have closed the mine and reclaimed the land.
Legitimate operators find that Federal and state regulators are intrusive, and contend that the authorities spend as much effort going after those among them who disregard regulations as it does pursuing wildcatters.
Regulators say lawful operators' concerns are exaggerated. "The egregious ones get our attention," Mr. Hugler said. "If you have a small operation, only a small number of rules apply to you. These rules are to protect you from killing yourself."
 
A Fear of the Future
 Competition for the Blue Gem Seam is increasing, and competition from wildcatters could drive down prices and wages and eventually exhaust the accessible approaches to the seam.
Dannie Lewis, 32, who is working the Gideon mine and is the son and grandson of coal miners, said he feared that when the mine closed another job might be hard to find.
"It worries me very much," he said. "I think that by the time I turn 40 there might not be mines in this county. The only thing I can do, being a Christian, is pray the good Lord will make a way for me and my family to survive."
He said he hoped his two sons, one 13 years old and the other just born, would find a different job. "I would like for them to do something that wouldn't be as physically strenuous and do better in life than I have," he said.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: A Reconstruction
The Path to War -- Bush's Crucial Decisions -- A special report.;
From the First, U.S. Resolve to Fight

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN and PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 2

 BODY:
The Bush Administration began planning an offensive campaign to dislodge Iraqi forces from Kuwait early last fall even as Administration officials insisted in public that the only mission of United States forces was to defend Saudi Arabia and enforce United Nations sanctions.
According to a reconstruction of major internal deliberations and decisions by President Bush and his senior advisers during the seven-month Persian Gulf crisis, offensive military planning began in earnest in September. 
 On Oct. 30, a week before Congressional elections, the President secretly approved a timetable for launching an air war against Iraq in mid-January and a large-scale ground offensive in February that would strike deep into Iraqi territory to outflank and encircle President Saddam Hussein's army.
This war-planning process went forward in conjunction with American diplomatic and economic pressure on Iraq to leave Kuwait, and senior officials indicated that Mr. Bush all along hoped -- at times even believed -- that sanctions coupled with the threat of war would be enough to dislodge the Iraqis.
The planning steps that the President approved in October were those carried out when the air war began on Jan. 17. The only element of the plan made public was the announcement by Mr. Bush on Nov. 8, two days after the election, that he had ordered a major reinforcement of American forces in the Persian Gulf to give them an offensive capability. That critical decision increased American troops from 230,000 to more than 500,000 and provided the allies the troop strength for the decisive flanking action carried out in February in the Iraqi desert.
Another plan submitted to the Pentagon early in October by Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of United States forces in the Persian Gulf, had been rejected because it envisioned a ground offensive directly into the heart of Iraqi forces and fortifications in Kuwait.
In addition to the timetable for offensive military action, the Administration's reconstruction of events shows that while the gulf crisis ended on the high note of military victory, earlier officials had been short of insight into President Hussein's intentions and bereft of military options to stop his invasion of Kuwait last summer.
It also shows that despite the Administration's carefully maintained image of unanimity on major decisions, there were debates at the White House and the Pentagon over how to respond to the Iraqi aggression.
A briefly contentious point was whether and how to keep Israel from striking back in response to Iraqi Scud missile attacks. At one stage, the President's advisers seriously debated letting the Israelis unleash their Jericho missiles on Iraqi territory. When this was rejected, the White House arranged for the Israelis to receive intelligence information on American military progress against the Scuds.
The reconstruction also provides an insight into a central mystery of the gulf crisis -- why Mr. Hussein ignored all warnings that his army would be destroyed and his country crippled. According to top officials, Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, told Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d at the end of their meeting in Geneva on Jan. 9:
"Your Arab allies will desert you. They will not kill other Arabs. Your alliance will crumble and you will be left lost in the desert. You don't know the desert because you have never ridden on a horse or a camel."
 
Sending Troops
The Allies Debate How Soon to Help
 At 2 A.M. on Aug. 2, 80,000 troops from Iraq's Republican Guard pushed across the Kuwaiti border and headed south toward Kuwait City, the capital. The first intelligence reports reached Washington around 6:30 P.M. Aug. 1, Eastern daylight time, as the invasion was occurring. At 9:15 P.M., Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, telephoned the American Embassy asking for immediate military help to stop the invasion, but, worried about how this would be seen in the Arab world, he insisted that the request "not be made public or treated as official."
At 10:30 P.M. Washington time, the embassy got a second telephone call from Sheik Saad. Ignore the first request, the desperate Kuwaiti said. Now the Government was "officially requesting help" and was willing to make this public. But before an answer could be conveyed back to Sheik Saad, he had dashed to Dasman Palace to pick up the Emir, the country's ruler, and was heading south in the royal limousine to Saudi Arabia.
"We had told them all along, 'You can't ask us for help when your enemies are knocking on the palace door,' " a senior Administration official said. "We just did not have the military assets in place."
Indeed, the nearest significant American military help, the aircraft carrier Independence, was far away in the Indian Ocean.
The view in Washington was that for the time being "Kuwait was a goner," as a senior official said. The whole focus of thinking was: How far south would the Iraqis move?
The first official contact with Saudi Arabia was made through the United States Embassy in Riyadh, where a senior diplomat asked what the kingdom wanted from the United States.
"The Saudis were a little flustered, a little scared," a senior official recalled. "They didn't know what they wanted." The Pentagon offered to send a squadron of tactical fighter planes.
"We'll get back to you," a Saudi official replied.
The President awoke the next morning to a crisis unforeseen in the post-cold-war era. At 5 A.M., Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser, presented him the draft of orders to freeze all Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets in the United States. Later, his senior advisers gathered in the Cabinet Room. During a brief photo session, Mr. Bush was asked whether the United States was prepared to intervene militarily. "We're not discussing intervention," he said.
When the cameras left, the atmosphere was one of shock and frustration. The President wanted options, but there appeared to be few that could immediately reverse the Iraqi push into Kuwait.
Nevertheless, when Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady began to lay out how the United States might adapt to expected higher oil prices, Mr. Bush interjected, according to a senior official: "Let's be clear about one thing: We are not here to talk about adapting. We are not going to plan how to live with this."
If Mr. Bush was frustrated and angry, it was because he had personally invested in the notion that Mr. Hussein's behavior could be moderated. Only a few days earlier, King Hussein of Jordan, whom Mr. Bush had regarded as a friend, had told him "absolutely not," when asked if Iraq would invade Kuwait, an official said.
When the National Security Council reconvened on Friday, Aug. 3, Mr. Scowcroft opened the meeting with a strong admonition that the discussion of options would be based on the recognition that Iraq's invasion was unacceptable and if allowed to stand, would fundamentally alter the balance of power in a vital part of the world.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, initially annoyed by a reticence among uniformed officers to provide concrete choices, brought General Schwarzkopf to explain the Pentagon's updated plan to use troops in a crisis in the Persian Gulf.
"I remember the body language when Norm talked about the 140,000 troops," a senior official said. "Good God, that's a lot of people" was the expression on some faces, he said.
Mr. Bush, however, focused on the principal obstacle to such a troop movement -- the Saudis. He had telephoned King Fahd and assured him that the United States would stand by Saudi Arabia, and he directed Mr. Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to brief the Saudi Ambassador, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, on the threat and on the troop plan.
Convinced that the sending of troops was the right course, Prince Bandar recommended that a high-level envoy fly to Saudi Arabia to convince King Fahd, who would have to make a quick decision. The deliberations moved to Camp David on Saturday. General Schwarzkopf took the President and his aides through a series of charts depicting the full plan to move troops to the gulf.
"This is what it will take to defend Saudi Arabia," the general said. Then, flipping to a final chart depicting an even larger use of troops, he added, "And if you want to liberate Kuwait, this is what it will take."
Although the group was focused on the immediate problem of defense, General Schwarzkopf had introduced the concept of offense from the very beginning.
Mr. Bush and his advisers debated who should go to Jidda, site of King Fahd's palace, and whether a high-level mission would run the risk of disastrous recriminations if the Saudis could not make up their minds. In the midst of the talks, Mr. Bush received a telephone call from Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak, who said he had an authoritative report that the Saudis had decided not to accept American forces.
Mr. Bush telephoned King Fahd to sound him out, without mentioning the Mubarak call. The King delayed in accepting a visit from Mr. Cheney. He wondered whether a delegation of technical experts might not be better. Mr. Bush offered General Schwarzkopf, but continued to push Mr. Cheney as the head of the mission, because if the King decided to receive an envoy of his level, it would be difficult for him to say no.
King Fahd delayed 14 hours before agreeing to see Mr. Cheney. In the ornate palace at Jidda, Mr. Cheney delivered his brief and then watched as the King and his brother spoke in Arabic to express some of their ambivalent feelings about the Kuwaitis.
"We have to do this; what will happen to Kuwait?" King Fahd said to Crown Prince Abdullah, according to one of the Arabic-speaking Westerners present.
"There is still a Kuwait," Prince Abdullah responded.
"Yes, but the entire population is living in our hotel rooms," the King shot back. Saudi Arabia was on board, as long as the Americans agreed in writing to leave when the threat passed and to get Saudi approval before initiating any offensive military action.
The dimensions of the planned military buildup were closely held by Mr. Bush and his inner circle. A senior White House aide scoffed at a published report in mid-August that the American force strength could reach 200,000.
 
Doubling the Force
When a Buildup Becomes Political
 The public outrage that spurred support for the sending of troops in August eroded when the President and Congress bogged down in a bruising budget fight during September and October. An intense Israeli-Palestinian clash in Jerusalem drew attention away from Kuwait, and the Central Intelligence Agency began reporting there were no signs that Mr. Hussein could be pressed by sanctions alone to leave Kuwait.
Reports of atrocities in Kuwait and Iraq's mistreatment of Western hostages, including their use as human shields at military and industrial installations, created tension among policy makers -- between a strategy of waiting out the Iraqis and taking the initiative to eject them.
"There was a sense of drift," a senior Administration official said. "Saddam seemed to have the initiative. We felt we had to do something to get it back."
Mr. Bush pressed the Pentagon to develop the offensive military options, but General Schwarzkopf protested that he did not have his defensive forces in place yet and the Iraqis were still pouring more troops into Kuwait.
Rushed as it was, the first offensive plan -- presented early in October to Mr. Cheney, General Powell and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a Pentagon conference room known as "the tank" -- was an unimaginative "up the middle" through the Iraqi front lines "right smack into his strength," as a senior official put it.
Over the next few weeks, General Schwarzkopf sent back a plan to conduct a flanking attack around Iraq's front line, a more imaginative approach, but Mr. Cheney and General Powell agreed with the commander's assessment that there were not enough allied forces to conduct such an attack while also preventing the Iraqi Army from coming south.
American officials said their initial dispatch of 180,000 troops would have given them both defensive and offensive options if the level of Iraqi forces in the region remained at 100,000. But as the Iraqi force climbed to 430,000 by the end of October, the United States had to match this to maintain a credible offensive option.
General Powell told General Schwarzkopf to state his full military requirements to drive the Iraqi Army out of Kuwait, and he flew to Saudi Arabia on Oct. 21 to discuss the plan and its timetable and brought it back to Mr. Cheney. When the Pentagon leaders took the plan to the White House on Oct. 30, it called for a timetable to begin a large-scale bombing campaign against Iraq in mid-January, followed by a ground campaign late in February.
The plan required almost doubling the 200,000 American forces in the gulf in little over three months, with a major call-up of the reserves.
In the two-hour meeting, Mr. Bush made two fundamental decisions: first, to set in motion the machinery for a mid-winter war against the Iraqi Army and, second, to win a United Nations mandate for that war. To that end, he dispatched Secretary of State Baker on a round-the-world tour to round up support for a Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force.
General Powell, Mr. Cheney, Mr. Scowcroft, Mr. Baker and the President all felt there was a reasonable chance that the enormous mobilization of American military power, combined with the setting of a deadline, might be enough to scare Mr. Hussein into leaving Kuwait, officials said. Mr. Cheney's nightmare was that Mr. Hussein would find more troops to send to the front to force another round of escalation.
The President showed no hesitation in making the controversial decision to increase troop strength, but decided to keep it secret until Nov. 8. Why?
"Nov. 8 was a very important date because it was after Nov. 6," a White House official said, referring to the election.
The troop increase sent a shudder through both the alliance and among many Americans. A senior White House official said: "Shortly after we announced the increase in troop strength, we got a sharp reaction from Capitol Hill, and the press was saying that nobody knows why we are there, and it looked like we had a big domestic problem."
It was during this period, aides say, that the President began thinking about "going the extra mile to avert a war" by sending Mr. Baker to Baghdad and inviting Foreign Minister Aziz to Washington -- a move he announced immediately after the United Nations Security Council vote on Nov. 29 sanctioning the use of force if Iraqi troops were not out of Kuwait by Jan. 15.
 
The Air War
Bush Becomes 'A Different Man'
 On Dec. 16, President Bush, in an interview with the British broadcaster David Frost, said of Mr. Hussein, "It's my view that he doesn't know what he is up against and that he doesn't believe the willpower of the United States. He is still unconvinced."
Yet two days later, speaking to Time magazine, Mr. Bush stated, "My gut says he will get out of there."
The contradictory instincts expressed in these two interviews reflected the President's mood swings in the weeks leading right up to the Jan. 16 decision to launch the air war. Some described this as a toughening of mood.
If there was a last chance to avert war, it was on Jan. 9, when Mr. Baker met Mr. Aziz in Geneva. The long session recessed after two hours and Mr. Baker reported by telephone to Mr. Bush that the Iraqi minister's tone was very reasonable.
At the time, Mr. Bush was meeting with a group of 15 members of Congress, and those present say that as the Geneva meeting resumed and then stretched to six hours, Mr. Bush seemed cautiously optimistic that a deal might be in the works. Then came a final call from Mr. Baker.
"The President excused himself to take the call and was gone for about eight minutes," said Representative Mel Levine, Democrat of California. "When he came back, our conversation stopped. The President's whole demeanor had changed. He was somber and grim. You could see it all over his face. He looked at us and said two words: 'No progress.' I felt it was a defining moment. He was a different man. When we asked why the meeting in Geneva had lasted so long, he simply said: 'History.' "
This was apparently a reference to Mr. Aziz's long recitation of Iraqi and Arab grievances with the United States. It was not the Iraqi's official's only complaint, though. He also laid into the Soviet Union.
"We don't have a patron anymore," Mr. Aziz complained to Mr. Baker. "If we still had the Soviets as our patron, none of this would have happened. They would have vetoed every U.N. resolution."
Mr. Baker warned Mr. Aziz during their session that a war with the United States would not be like Iraq's war with Iran.
Mr. Aziz riposted with a prediction that the Arab allies would abandon the United States and that in any event the desert would defeat the Western armies.
After the Baker-Aziz meeting, all of the President's advisers agreed that war was now inevitable. On Tuesday morning, Jan. 15, Mr. Bush sat in a wingbacked chair by the fireplace in the Oval Office and signed a national security directive for war against Iraq.
 
The Israelis
Need to Placate A Worried Ally
 As early as September, President Bush and Secretary Baker began sounding out the Arab allies about how they would respond if the Iraqis launched missiles against Israel to bring it into the war.
The answers that came back over the next few months were generally positive: Provided that the Israelis did not attack Iraq first and that any Israeli retaliation was "proportionate," none of America's Arab allies would have a problem, they indicated.
On Dec. 11, Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, came to Washington and met with President Bush in the Oval Office -- the first time the two men had spoken since the gulf crisis began. The President, officials said, told the Israeli that in the event of war, the United States had specific plans to destroy fixed Iraqi missile-launching sites in western Iraq, as well as all the mobile launchers in the area.
But Mr. Bush also told Mr. Shamir that since Washington was doing all it could to avoid any linkage between the gulf crisis and the Arab-Israel dispute, so the Israelis had to avoid linking them by retaliating for any Iraqi attacks. Mr. Shamir, eager to patch up strained relations with Mr. Bush, promised that Israel would not launch a pre-emptive strike and that he would consult with the President before responding to an attack by Iraq.
The Administration reciprocated by establishing a secure hot line -- code-named "Hammer Rick" -- between the Pentagon's crisis center and the Israeli Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv, so that the Israelis could be given instant warning of missile launches detected by American satellites.
Minutes after the first Iraqi Scud missiles slammed into Tel Aviv on the evening of Jan. 17, Mr. Cheney used the hot line to talk to an agitated Defense Minister Moshe Arens, while in Mr. Scowcroft's office at the White House, Mr. Baker telephoned Mr. Shamir, as did Mr. Bush later.
The message from Washington, a senior official said, was simple and clear: "We are going after western Iraq, full bore. There is nothing that your Air Force can do that we are not doing. If there is, tell us and we will do it. We appreciate your restraint, but please don't play into Saddam's hands. We also told them that night that we would give them more Patriots with American crews."
At one point during that tense evening, the President's most senior Cabinet and foreign policy advisers and Vice President Dan Quayle were sitting in Mr. Scowcroft's office and a top Administration official -- no one will identify him -- suggested that since it was inevitable that the Israelis were going to retaliate at some point, why not let them go now, using their arsenal of Jericho missiles instead of planes. After a discussion among the President's men -- unbeknownst to the Israelis -- the majority view was that the Israelis had to be, and could be, talked out of retaliating.
Mr. Shamir, a senior official said, was "very cool" and never insisted on retaliating, even though he was under pressure: Israel's Air Force chief, Maj. Gen. Avihu Binun, kept arguing that his pilots could do a better job than the Americans, and that the Patriot missile batteries would not protect Israel, American officials said.
Mr. Arens was not so cool. He told Mr. Cheney and Mr. Baker that Israel would have to retaliate at some time and asked Mr. Cheney again that night for access to the electronic identity codes that Israeli fighter planes would need to distinguish between American and Iraqi jets. In turning down these requests, Mr. Cheney helped to ease the Israelis' anxiety by ordering more intelligence sharing to show the Israelis exactly what targets the allies were hitting in western Iraq.
Essentially, the conversations of that night -- both the American appeals and the Israeli responses -- were repeated with every Scud attack. Mr. Arens would ask for the codes, and later for an air corridor through Saudi Arabia so that Israeli planes could retaliate without going through Jordan. Mr. Cheney would refuse all requests, Mr. Bush would say how much the Israeli restraint was appreciated and Mr. Shamir would weigh it all and sit tight.
Mr. Bush knew he had a secret ally: The Israeli public, which was overwhelmingly against retaliating and whose feelings highly influenced Mr. Shamir. When Mr. Arens came to see Mr. Bush on Feb. 11 to tell him again that Israel had to do something, the President came armed with the latest Israeli public opinion polls tucked into his breast pocket.
 
The Soviet Mission
Gorbachev Envoy Makes a Last Try
 On Monday night, Feb. 11, Mr. Cheney visited the White House to tell the President that General Schwarzkopf had asked for a "window" of dates to begin the ground war,, with the earliest date being Feb. 21.
The President agreed that would be the planning date. Within a day or two, General Schwarzkopf refined his H-Hour as 4 A.M. on Feb. 24 (8 P..M. Feb. 23, Eastern time).
Once the military timing was set, a new factor came into play when the Soviet Union initiated its eleventh-hour attempt to mediate a face-saving withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
Administration officials said the first inkling came on Thursday, Feb. 14, in a cable sent by Mr. Gorbachev to Mr. Bush reporting on the discussions that his envoy, Yevgeny M. Primakov, had held in Baghdad the previous day with Mr. Hussein.
In his cable, Mr. Gorbachev said that Mr. Hussein displayed "some change in attitude" when pressed for an unconditional Iraqi pullout from Kuwait in accordance with the United Nations resolutions. This, he said, merited exploration.
Mr. Gorbachev, apparently under pressure from his military to show more independence from the United States and protect Iraq, a longtime client, from destruction, added in his cable that given the possibility for a peaceful solution, "it might be desirable" if the United States did not launch a ground war until talks with Mr. Aziz were completed.
In Washington, this was not received with enthusiasm.
"The initial feeling was that at the final moment of decision-making, this old ghost from the past got up to haunt us," a senior Administration official said. "We were well aware of the wreckage potential. From the start, the President took the view that Gorbachev, for domestic reasons, obviously needed to be seen to be playing a role. We had to reject that role, but not dismiss it in a way that would embarrass him."
Essentially from Monday night until noon on Saturday, President Bush and his advisers engaged in a dizzying series of phone calls and cables with Moscow to administer a mercy killing to the Soviet peace initiatve. Each day, Mr. Gorbachev would say he had brought the Iraqis a little closer to an unconditional withdrawal, and each day Mr. Bush would point out the conditional fine print that the Iraqis were adding -- particularly their insistence right up to the end that once they withdrew, all sanctions, reparations and other demands in the United Nations resolutions would have to be dropped.
The turning point came on Thursday night, when the President, having concluded that the Soviet diplomacy was getting out of hand, decided he wanted to put out a statement with his own terms for an Iraqi withdrawal in compliance with all the United Nations resolutions. During the White House deliberations, General Powell suggested to the President, "Why not just set a deadline?" on Friday for noon Saturday because a date would be helpful for his forces who were poised to attack at the already appointed hour of 8 P.M. Eastern Time, on Saturday.
Nevertheless, even Saturday morning the Soviets floated a new, "improved" plan at the United Nations Security Council, but when pressed by Washington, Moscow could not confirm that the Iraqis were on board. The Soviets were so unsure of where the Iraqis stood that they did not press the Security Council to vote on their plan, which Washington would have vetoed.
Summing up the whole experience with Mr. Gorbachev, a senior Administration official said: "He was acting to assert the interests of his various bureaucracies, but at the end of the day he was not ready to put his relationship with the United States on the line for those interests."
At noon Saturday, when the American ultimatum for Iraqi forces to be out of Kuwait expired, Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker called Mr. Gorbachev.
They thanked him again for his efforts, reiterated why they were still considered insufficient, and told him that if he was in contact with the Iraqis, he should tell them "that they didn't believe it when we said that the air war would start right after Jan. 15 so they should believe this deadline," and get out while they still had a chance to save something.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: United Nations;
U.N. Approves Measure Bolstering Allies' Rights

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 2

 BODY:
The Security Council easily approved a resolution tonight that effectively endorses President Bush's call for allied troops to remain in the Persian Gulf until Iraq has complied with his peace terms.
The measure, approved in an 11-1 vote, also denies Baghdad an immediate formal cease-fire, and affirms the allies' right to attack again if their conditions are not met at the meeting on Sunday between military commanders of the allied coalition and of Iraq. 
 Of the Council's 15 members, only Cuba voted against the measure. China, India and Yemen abstained. The resolution came to a vote only after the Council rejected 18 Cuban amendments designed to change the measure to a simple call for a cease-fire.
The United States had been anxious for the Security Council to approve the resolution before the meeting on Sunday near the Iraq-Kuwait border, in which commanders from the two sides are to discuss the conditions set by Mr. Bush on a permanent end to hostilities. The resolution effectively approves those conditions.
 
13th Vote on Gulf Crisis
 The resolution was the 13th approved by the Security Council to address the gulf crisis since Iraq invaded Kuwait last August. The vote tonight suggested that international support for the United States' handling of the war is considerable, though somewhat diminished from a few weeks ago.
The 11 votes cast in favor of the resolution represented the smallest majority mustered by the United States on any of the gulf resolutions, though it was comfortably above the minimum of 9 needed for the measure to pass.
Many countries welcomed the new resolution as the first step toward a permanent settlement of the war and the resolution of wider Middle East problems, including the Palestinian issue and Israel's disputes with its Arab neighbors.
The United States representative at the United Nations, Thomas R Pickering, welcomed the vote. He said the resolution "turns our attention from a war we never wanted, from the tragedy precipitated by Iraq to the greatest challenge of all: building lasting peace and security."
He spoke indirectly of the need to address the region's other long-term problems, noting that Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d would soon depart for the Middle East to see what needs to be done "to insure the peace we have secured is a lasting one."
The Soviet representative, Yuri M. Vorontsov, was more explicit, declaring that the time had come for all countries to begin focusing on resolving the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait and other issues troubling the Middle East.
 
Text Preserves Option of Force
 The resolution affirms that the coalition allies have suspended fighting only to give Iraq a chance to comply with Mr. Bush's demands. It makes it clear that the allies retain the right to attack again if Iraq refuses to do so.
After listing the allies' demands, the resolution specifically recognizes that, during the time Iraq needs to comply with these terms, the provisions of paragraph 2 of Resolution 678 remain valid. That paragraph authorized the allies "to use all necessary means" to evict Iraq from Kuwait, including force.
Under the resolution, the principal conditions Iraq must meet before the allies will agree to a "definitive end to the hostilities" include the return of all P.O.W's and about 17,000 Kuwaiti civilian detainees, the repeal of all Iraqi laws annexing Kuwait, acceptance by Baghdad of its liability for war losses and damages and an end to Scud missile attacks and other provocations against Israel or any other countries in the region.
 
Sanctions Remain for Now
 In addition, Iraq is required to return war dead and to help in locating mines and booby traps and to reveal the sites of chemical and biological weapons. It must also send its commanders to discuss these and other matters with Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the allied commander.
The text makes it clear that the economic and trade sanctions imposed by the Council on Iraq remain in effect. It sets no conditions or date for lifting them.

HEADLINE: Man Held in Forest Hills Sex Attacks

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
A 25-year-old Manhattan man was charged last night in a series of six sex attacks and robberies that had cast a pall of fear over Forest Hills, Queens, since September.
The police identified the suspect as Roy Hickman, of 252 West 149th Street in Manhattan. He was picked up at 9 P.M. Friday on a street in the exclusive Forest Hills Garden section, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Edward J. Burns. Two patrolman assigned to the 112th Precinct thought he fit the general description of the assailant, who often ended his attacks by slashing his victims. 
 The officers, Steven Haynes and Eric Crumbly, noticed a bulge in Mr. Hickman's clothing and found a knife with a 12-inch blade, the police said.
"We feel comfortable that we have the right individual, through the physical evidence that we have and statements that have been made by this individual," said Capt. Barry Noxon, commanding officer of the 17th Division.
 
Apartment Searched
 Members of the Queens Sex Crimes Squad and the Queens Homicide Task Force obtained a search warrant and went to Mr. Hickman's Harlem apartment, where he lives with his mother and stepfather, Sergeant Burns said.
The police said they found two knives in the apartment that they believe might be connected to the crimes. They also found property that belonged to two victims, Sergeant Burns said.
Captain Noxon would not explain what the property was, saying only that it was a "significant find."
At least five lineups had been conducted by last night, Captain Noxon said. "We had good results," he said.
Late last night, Mr. Hickman's stepfather, Green Dasher, 77, dressed in pajamas and bathrobe and moving around their fourth-floor tenement apartment with the aid of a cane, said he could not believe Mr. Hickman could commit the crimes with which he was charged.
"It's hard to believe," Mr. Dasher, a retired clothes presser, said. "He just don't seem like that kind of boy. I just hope he's not the one."
Mr. Dasher said Mr. Hickman was unemployed but had been a street peddler at one point.
Mr. Hickman had lived with his father, who died several years ago of a stroke. He then moved in with his mother, Lila Merchant, also a retired presser, and Mr. Dasher about a year ago.
Mr. Dasher said his stepson had few friends in the neighborhood but had a girlfriend somewhere in New Jersey.
 
Other Links Sought

In the first of the series of attacks, Mr. Hickman was charged with sexual abuse and robbery for an incident on Sept. 16. He is also charged with sexual abuse and robbery on Oct. 29, rape and robbery on Feb. 6, robbery on Feb. 11, rape and robbery on Feb. 21 and sexual abuse and robbery on Feb. 26.
Captain Noxon said the police were investigating to see whether Mr. Hickman might be linked to other sex crimes.
Most of the attacks took place in the Forest Hills Gardens neighborhood, a wealthy enclave within Forest Hills, of stately Tudor homes around the West Side Tennis Club. It is considered a relatively safe area, but after the attacks, the fear of many residents intensified.
The Sex Crimes Squad and Homicide Task Force tried to trace a pattern and a "script" for the rapist by interviewing the victims and scores of residents and merchants in the area, said Captain Noxon. The description and pattern that emerged were given to police officers before they began patrol each shift. He said Officers Haynes and Crumbley zeroed in on the subject and then felt he was evasive in answering their questions when asked what he was doing in the neighborhood.
 
Police Cite 'Viciousness'

Some of the women were accosted near the subway station at Continental Avenue and 71st Street. In the most recent assault last Tuesday night, a man forced a teen-age girl at knifepoint into a yard he tried to rape her.
What marked the attacks was what Captain Noxon called the "viciousness" of the slashing.
"The slashing after the incident, the cutting of the throat areas, that was his trademark," said Captain Noxon. "That seemed to be the thing that stood out, that made it espcially vicious."
He added, "It appeared he escalated his viciousness, escalated his daring as we studied the assaults."
Mr. Hickman was charged with two counts of rape and robbery, three counts of sexual abuse and robbery, one count of robbery, and in each case, criminal psossesion of deadly weapon, Sergeant Burns said.
Mr. Hickman had been picked up by the transit police on two occasions for fare-beating in the subway: in 1986 and again on Feb. 13, both times in Manhattan, said Sergeant Burns.
Mr. Dasher, the stepfather, said Mr. Hickman would stay around the apartment "for a week at a time."
"Sometimes he would go out at 6 and come back at 3 or 4 in the morning," Mr. Dasher said.
"Nobody around here knows him," Mr. Dasher said. "When he leaves here, he goes downtown -- at least that's what he says."
Asked why a suspect who lived in Manhattan might choose Queens for victims, Captain Noxon said, "It will be something that as the investigation continues, we'll find out -- why he was attracted to this area."

HEADLINE: Yachting;
Japan's Plan for a Major Effort

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

 BODY:
The day starts out simply enough for the 30 crewmen of Japan's America's Cup challenge team.
There is an hour of exercise: running, swimming or working out on weight machines at the team's compound, a sprawling apartment complex close to where the boats are docked at Mission Bay. Then there is breakfast. 
 Bowls of miso soup and seaweed, pan-fried fish, rice and green tea set a hearty oriental table. But how to explain the miniature boxes of breakfast cereals, the toast, yogurt, fried eggs, hot dogs and coffee?
Hikaru Shiraishi eats frankfurters by skewering them with the tips of his chopsticks. And Yoshiya Sasaki is adept at folding a fried egg in half and eating it with one gulp. But the Western dishes have other palates to please, those of the five New Zealand yachtsmen who form the sailing backbone of Japan's first effort in history to win the America's Cup.
Few question the Nippon's potential successes in the computer-driven aspects of boat design. But finding experienced crewmen in Japan's fledgling yachting community was like spotting a buoy in fog-shrouded Sagami Bay near Tokyo.
Kaoru Ogimi, vice commodore of Japan's cup sponsor, the Nippon Ocean Racing Club, said recently in San Diego that his team was forced to look outside Japan for a crew.
"The big question mark is, of course, the people, the software side," said Ogimi. The syndicate's answer was to hire Chris Dickson of New Zealand, the top-ranked match-racing skipper in the world.
"What we've been doing around the clock with him in our own camp is trying to reach out and go beyond Chris," said Ogimi.
To make the best use of Dickson's expertise, the Nippon group in 1987 bought two former America's Cup yachts to use as training vessels. The boats happened to be the same 12-Meters, KZ 3 and KZ 5, that Dickson and his teammates sailed to a near victory four years ago in cup trial races in Australia.
The purchase was designed to help Japanese sailors prepare for even bigger boats: the new 76- to 78-foot International America's Cup Class yachts that will be sailed in the 1992 cup races here.
"None of us have ever sailed in boats in any size approximating these," said Ogimi of the $2 million racing craft. The America's Cup class boats are 10 feet longer than most 12-Meters, and one-third lighter. They carry far more sail area, and are faster downwind by 6 or 7 knots.
Even Dickson, who has sailed on everything from a seven-foot dinghy to an 80-foot maxi-boat, is impressed with the new class.
"These boats portray power," he said, while standing on the deck of JPN 6, the second of the syndicate's two identical new America's Cup class yachts. "When you look up, you see a cloud of sail. Suddenly it feels like a tiny little boat with a huge amount of sail area."
A budget of six billion yen, about $40 million, has fueled the syndicate's extensive costs of research and development. From a country rich in naval architecture through its commercial shipbuilding, Japanese experts have turned their attention to sailboats.
At Nippon's 45,000-square-foot compound on Mission Bay, a new sail loft is taking shape. Four trailers and 12 shipping containers -- a combination of 20- and 40-footers -- serve as space for offices, a machine shop, computer center and storage space.
The promise of competition looms large. Syndicates from Italy, New Zealand and France are also in San Diego. By year's end, 12 challenge teams and two defenders are expected be sailing.
Dickson had his first crack at sailing one of Japan's freshly built cup boats last April. He and his crew launched the new breed of yachts in Gamagori City, Nippon's training camp 200 miles southwest of Tokyo. The boats were shipped to San Diego in mid-January.
For starters, the 29-year-old Dickson and the 40-year-old Makoto Namba, his Japanese team captain, had to teach many on the crew how to sail. The first recruits answered newspaper advertisements placed by the syndicate. The ads called for individuals at least 175 centimeters tall (6 feet) and weighing at least 82 kilograms (170 pounds).
Nearly 300 people, most with weak sailing skills but strong athletic backgrounds, responded. One man thought he was trying out for a golf tournament. Ten were chosen after a battery of physical and psychological testing. Known within the syndicate as the green crew, the novice sailors have put in more than 8,000 hours on the water since then.
Takashi Kawahara, a Nippon sail trimmer, was working in Japan as a pig farmer when he read the ad. Jin Matsubara was a young businessman in Tokyo who sailed for a hobby. He was inspired to answer the crew ad by a video he had once seen of the 1983 cup races.
Shiraishi, a professional diver, remembers being overwhelmed the first time he joined the Nippon sailing team.
"I didn't know the winch name," he said last week. "I didn't know anything. Someone told me to ease something, but I didn't know what ease meant."
Others confess to falling overboard now and again, and embarrassment unbecoming to a seasoned yachtsman.
Language was a barrier at first, and to some degree, still is. There were reports that friction had developed on the boat during the early days because of communication problems. Dickson and Namba insist that those days are gone.
"Big-boat sailing is very systematic," said Namba at the docks last week. "Once we have established the system, there are not many opportunities to express yourself any other way."
Namba, who commented through an interpreter, speaks limited English. But at crew meetings, he speaks in English.
The team returned two weeks ago from a three-week vacation. The prospect of a world championship May 4-11 here for the new cup boats -- a kind of dress rehearsal for the America's Cup trials next winter -- has thrown training into high gear six days a week.
Plans to sail last week were stopped short by an unusual turn of events in drought-ravaged California: rain and wind in San Diego. Dickson, who is known for keeping his crew on a short leash, gave them free rein in deciding whether to sail on Thursday.
"We took a vote," said Dickson, "and we feel this isn't a good day to go out." Dickson, whose boyish looks belie a voice of authority, left no room for second-guessing.
Rain deluged the boat yard minutes later. Wind instruments on the boats measured the velocity at 25 knots and higher. In a yacht where a new mast made of carbon fiber costs $250,000, chance is not part of the game.
Thirty well-heeled Japanese companies are behind the Nippon effort. Each has donated about $650,000 to join, a roster that organizers say hinges more on national pride than economic returns.
Tatsumitsu Yamasaki, a wealthy entrepreneur and avid yachtsman who founded the syndicate, has spoken of the America's Cup as an "irrational passion" and a "noble goal."
But the Japanese propensity for achieving also drives the syndicate.
"Japan is trying to catch up with the rest of the world," said Emili Miuri, a Nippon spokeswoman. "They have achieved in many other ways, and even moved forward. But in sport and culture, they have not caught up."

HEADLINE: When Bigger Trucks Get on the Road

 BODY:
The article on triple trailers in New Jersey raises a very distasteful argument that says a measure of highway safety should be sacrificed for the benefit of greater profits of trucking and trucking-dependent industries.
That argument should not be allowed to sway Federal legislators who are considering amending the Federal Highway Reauthorization Act to permit carrying weights of trucks to increase, from 80,000 pounds to 137,000 pounds. To carry that much weight would require trucking companies to use triple trailers.
The trucking industry claims it needs the bigger trucks to increase productivity, but productivity should not be attained at the cost of safety. I am all for increased productivity, but trucks are now involved in a disproportionate amount of fatal accidents and are responsible for about 5,000 deaths in New Jersey each year. Allowing bigger trucks to carry more weight on our highways is to invite disaster for motorists.
New Jersey is too densely populated and its highways too heavily traveled to accommodate triple trailers. We also have a disproportionate number of elderly drivers who could easily be unnerved by the highway competition offered by huge triple trailers.
I am not unsympathetic to the argument from the trucking industry that increases in fuel costs have cut into profits. However, fuel price increases are not the fault of New Jersey motorists, and they should not be exposed to increased risk of death because of the failure of the Reagan and Bush Administrations to develop an energy policy that would hold down the cost of fuel.
As we have recently witnessed, the major oil companies have racked up obscene profits in 1990, indicating that truck fuel price increases are not warranted and should be rolled back, which will do a great deal to help truckers and consumers.
A more pertinent economic argument to be considered is who will pay for the damage to New Jersey roads caused by triple trailers. That damage, either through wear and tear from trucks or through the increased accidents they cause, will have to be paid by New Jersey taxpayers.
The Federal Government, under President Bush, has backed away from its long-held responsibility to finance highway repair. Greater stress on New Jersey's infrastructure caused by giant trucks will mean higher taxes for our taxpayers.
I am uncompromisingly opposed to allowing triple trailers on our highways, and I have petitioned our state's Congressional representatives to oppose any Federal legislation that would allow such monsters on our highways.

HEADLINE: Phases of War: Politics;
Did Someone Say 'Domestic Policy'?

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IT was a familiar political tableau: A Republican President confidently striding across the center stage of foreign policy, while a chorus of Democrats stood in the wings, saying, "Yes, but...."
What about the economy, Democrats began to ask last week. What about education, the environment, health care, civil rights? Where is President Bush's domestic agenda? Their voices, however, barely broke through the cheers as the war in the Persian Gulf wound down. 
 Mr. Bush's approval rating was at 86 percent, while Republican strategists charted a surge of national optimism in the public opinion polls. "It's morning again in America," said Richard Reed, a Republican polltaker, referring to the triumphant slogan of Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign.
Assuming that Mr. Bush's successes in foreign policy hold, a key dynamic of the 1992 Presidential campaign may have already emerged: Democrats arguing that the nation must address an array of domestic problems, while Mr. Bush offers himself as a tested, seasoned Commander in Chief.
Mr. Bush may need an aggressive new domestic policy for the judgment of history, but does he need one for re-election? He obviously must worry about the economy, but must he match the Democrats, program for program, on all the other domestic problems that register in the public opinion polls? These questions seem minor compared to the challenge the Democrats face in finding a nominee who could compete against a President who has just won a popular war.
"Voters view national security as the single most important quality in a President, and they have always been unwilling to take risks with it," said Robert Teeter, a top political adviser to Mr. Bush. "Voters have concluded that the one time they did that over the past 20 years, it was a mistake." He was referring to the Carter Presidency, a favorite point of reference last week for some of the more partisan Republicans as they basked in victory.
Democratic analysts, by and large, did not minimize their predicament. "Being Commander in Chief became larger in the Presidential job description because of the war in the gulf, and it will be harder for Democrats, for Democratic candidates, to prove that they're up to that part of the job," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic polltaker. "The historical reality is, this is exactly the reason voters elect a George Bush rather than a Michael Dukakis."
 
Changing the Subject
 Yet some Democrats privately worry that their nominating system is likely to produce yet another outsider in 1992, with views on national security closer to those of the party's liberal wing than those of the general electorate. In the meantime, even as Democrats made the first gentle attempts to turn the discussion to domestic policy, they were careful to hail the President and the allied victory.
"The country deserves and needs to appreciate the fullness of this success," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader and potential Presidential candidate. "Clearly, the President gets and deserves credit for sticking with his policy, putting the coalition together, and skillfully leading the military to a very positive conclusion." Such deference was the norm among Democrats last week.
This was no Panama or Grenada, events that held the public's attention for a matter of days or weeks and then vanished from the television screens. The gulf crisis dominated the nation's psyche for seven months -- week after week of People Magazine stories on the troops in the desert, song dedications on the radio to spouses and lovers "in Saudi," yellow ribbons everywhere and local blood drives.
As a result, Operation Desert Storm will probably produce more than a short-term spike in the President's popularity, said John Mueller, a professor of political science at the University of Rochester and the author of "War, Presidents and Public Opinion."
"I think it's likely to linger for a substantial period of time," he said. "The best analogy is probably Maggie Thatcher and the Falklands. She was able to ride the crest of that for quite a while."
Many analysts say the war was also a remarkable confidence-builder for a generation that was bred on bitter memories of Vietnam. These were the powerful chords that Mr. Bush was striking last week. "It's a proud day for America and, by God, we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all," the President said.
Depending on how long the afterglow lasts, and how much the economy begins to improve, the Democrats could face a strategic dilemma as the 1992 campaign begins: How to make the case for change without leaving themselves open to the charge of being "gloom and doom Democrats," as the Republicans put it so often.
"When Americans love themselves and their country and feel good about themselves, I don't think the Democratic platform is very appealing," said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee and one of the most partisan voices in Washington.
Some Democrats sought comfort in the case of Winston Churchill, a revered wartime leader who saw his Conservative Party defeated at the polls three months after the surrender of Germany, as British voters turned to domestic needs and wants. A foreign-policy Presidency is not enough, they suggest; Americans will want something more. This argument, however, overlooks the fact that this is not a parliamentary system and Americans choose a President, not a party.
The White House recognizes that it cannot seem indifferent to domestic concerns. The President paused last week to give a domestic policy address, although it revolved around proposals previously advanced, such as tougher crime laws and greater opportunities for parents to choose the schools their children can attend.
Two days later, the Administration turned its attention to civil rights and protection against job discrimination, a subject that prompted a lengthy fight with Congress last year. But the measure the Administration proposed late Friday night ---- not the most opportune time to release new initiatives ---- was largely a rehash of the proposals Congress had spurned last year.
The President's critics say his domestic agenda has been a combination of rhetoric, political positioning, and change around the margins. Many cited the Administration's recently released energy policy as an example of Mr. Bush's lackluster interest in domestic affairs. Many of his fellow Republicans are urging the President to use his newly enhanced popularity -- as Mrs. Thatcher used hers -- to push through new domestic programs.
But if the economy improves, Mr. Bush may be able to pursue his passion at little political cost and be, essentially, a foreign-policy President. Until Democrats produce a nominee with credibility as a potential Commander in Chief, they will continue to plead the case for domestic problems -- but from Capitol Hill.

A Short, Persuasive Lesson In Warfare

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.

DATELINE: DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia

 BODY:
THE 42-day war in the Persian Gulf Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf's hit-hard, hurry-up, high-tech, hyper-successful campaign to savage Iraq's military and oust it from Kuwait -- was a study in lessons learned.
In a political, military and especially a psychological sense, it drew a line beneath the hauntingly inconclusive Vietnam tragedy. The United States will not soon forget its sins and humiliations in Southeast Asia a generation ago, but it has learned from them, and as President Bush exulted on Friday, "By God, we've kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all." 
 The list of lessons is long, but start with this trio.
* Never go to war before insuring domestic consensus and establishing international support. Lyndon B. Johnson never managed to do either; George Bush did both, with a master's touch. The President coaxed Congress to the point of backing a war -- not by much, but by enough to carry him through a few weeks or a few months -- and he and his Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, built and maintained an international coalition that cut across lines of economic, religious, political, ideological, regional and even personal conflict. They said it couldn't last, but it did.
 
The First Principle
 * Never go to war without a clear objective. Lieut. Gen. Thomas Kelly, the avuncular oracle of the Pentagon these past weeks, called it "the first principle of war" -- a target, clearly designated and steadfastly lit by the politicians, that the generals and admirals could take a bead on. Mr. Bush must have said five times a day for six months that Saddam Hussein had to leave Kuwait, without conditions, to satisy the United States. No such goal was ever convincingly articulated for the Vietnam adventure.
* Take no half measures. Mr. Bush gave his commanders the troops they said they needed, right away, instead of feeding them in slowly. He granted no sanctuaries to the enemy. He resisted the inevitable calls for a cease-fire until he judged the job done, lest he give the Iraqis a chance to catch their breath, rearm and fight again. Those three decisions enabled General Schwarzkopf to develop and execute a strategy that placed the heaviest fighting squarely on President Saddam Hussein's own territory, brought American firepower to bear all at once and kept it there to do the job. The result was clearest, perhaps, in the casualty figures -- the staggering gap between the 89 Americans known to have been killed and the tens of thousands of Iraqis dead on the battlefield, as well as even vaster numbers taken prisoner.
There were old lessons, too, left over from other wars in other decades, other centuries, but no less apt for that. Here are seven:
* Deception can be worth a dozen divisions. General Schwarzkopf assembled all the paraphernalia and manpower for amphibious operations, practiced amphibious operations and talked about amphibious operations. But they were never part of his basic plan. He fooled his foe into wasting thousands of men and guns. On an elaborate battle model of Kuwait City discovered in a school on Thursday, every Iraqi gun and troop unit in the region of the capital faced the sea, like the guns of Singapore during World War II. They were of little use in combating invaders coming from other directions.
* Without air cover, tanks are tin gasoline cans, just waiting to blow up. When the Luftwaffe could no longer protect him, Rommel lost in North Africa; when the clouds that had protected him finally parted, von Rundstedt lost the Battle of the Bulge; with his air force destroyed or dispersed and his attack helicopters -- Soviet, French and German -- mysteriously uninvolved, Mr. Hussein could do nothing to protect his T-72's and T-62's from American tanks and, especially, the terrifying Hellfire missiles fired by the army's Apache helicopters and the equally deadly Mavericks fired by A-10 Warthog attack planes flown by the Air Force.
* In the desert, supply is everything. Armies can live off the land, to a degree, in many parts of the world, but not in the sands of Arabia, where nature is an implacable enemy. Again, air supremacy made the difference. It meant American logistics specialists, under a tough general from Pennsylvania named Gus Pagonis, could move mountains, and allied forces had 10 of everything, thousands of miles from home; it meant many front-line Iraqi troops had so little they ate grass and hoarded cups of rainwater.
* Modern weapons become obsolete terrifyingly quickly, which is why maintaining modern armed forces costs so much. For all the oil wealth he squandered on arms, Saddam Hussein went to war against the United States -- cruise missiles, Stealth bombers, electronic countermeasures and all -- with an air-defense system that was a generation or two out of date.
* Men matter as much as machines, and there the Iraqi forces were outclassed in two ways. One was training, skill, sheer ability. "Not everything depends on the quality of the technology," said Nikolai Kutsenko, a ranking military planner in the Soviet Union, which supplied so much of Iraq's best equipment. "More depends on the professional training of those who use and service it, and both, in the Iraqi Army, left much to be desired."
So did the troops' morale, a second key area of deficiency. For that, General Schwarzkopf blamed a leadership "so uncaring that in the end they could keep them there only at the point of a gun."
* If you can't communicate, you can't command. Battlefield evidence collected by Marines showed chemical weapons ready for use, but orders never came from the top. And the total lack of coordination between squadrons of tanks and between tanks and artillery in the big battle that ended the war convinced American armored commanders that their adversaries were operating with nothing approaching adequate radio links between units.
* Get around him, if you can, and hit him from the flank or the rear, rather than marching into his strength. Talking military history long before he launched last week's ground offensive, General Schwarzkopf often dwelt on Cannae, the epic battle in the heel of the Italian boot in which Hannibal perfected the double envelopment. The American commander used a single envelopment to equally good effect, forcing the Republican Guards, potential battle-winners, to fight on his ground at a time of his choosing.
In Vietnam, the United States overestimated its own power and prowess and underestimated that of the enemy. Here, it was just the opposite.
Saddam Hussein proved to be as full of folly on the battlefield as in the halls of diplomacy, relying on a Maginot line as easily flankable as the original, making his tanks vulnerable by digging them into the sand and robbing them of their mobility.
It proved impossible for a nation with the population of the Netherlands and the gross domestic product of Portugal even to dent a coalition that included the United States, Europe and two of the main Arab military powers.
On the other side of the line, the new, all-volunteer American military, with its new, smart weapons, proved formidable. Especially the Air Force, Naval air and Army air, which severed the enemy's logistical lifelines, scrambled his communications, blinded his reconnaissance eyes and finally killed his advanced tanks, his last best hope of averting disaster.
As Col. Hal Hornburg, a top Air Force pilot, said, it took the grunts to apply the coup de grace. It always does. But air power decided it.

The Budget Chief: Disarming Critics With a New Tact And Good Behavior

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
FEW public servants have ever commanded a process as complex as the Federal budget more completely than Richard A. Darman.
Nor have many unelected officials ever commanded so much attention and intermittent controversy as has Mr. Darman, President Bush's Director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
 When he writes a budget message, it makes interesting reading. When he testifies, intellectual sparks fly. But more spectators at those hearings come for entertainment than enlightenment, waiting to see whether questions that he regards as stupid or mean or baiting get his goat.
So when Congress and the Bush Administration get down to the business of proving whether they can keep the budget agreement they made last fall -- the first tests come this week on supplemental appropriations in the House -- Mr. Darman is likely to be one major flash point.
The tests this week will not come over paying for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, but over what other expenditures can justly be deemed "emergency" spending (the agreement allowed for emergencies). Many lawmakers want to recompense Israel and Turkey, but especially Israel, for the costs the war imposed on their military and civil defense forces.
Mr. Darman testified firmly on Tuesday against Senators pressing an Israeli request for $1 billion to cover the costs of air force alerts, gas masks and other items. He said "emergency" meant, in effect, "Is this needed yesterday, today, or tomorrow?" The Israeli request did not meet that test, he said.
"It's not an immediate emergency the way coming up with the funds and the legal authorization to allow certain kinds of security expenses and equipment to be installed at certain airports here right away or covering the extra costs of security at the Capitol immediately for the overtime and so on -- those are immediate needs."
He spoke bluntly, avoiding the bureaucratese that had led him to say "if indeed the war does suddenly clarify favorably in the next some number of days" (in English: if the war ends soon).
But by Thursday James A. Baker 3d was telling House leaders that the Administration had not decided whether to support "emergency" aid for Israel and Turkey, and leaving them with the impression that it would decide in favor.
For someone whose every word is scrutinized for hidden, political, even Machiavellian motives, this was probably a case where Mr. Darman was trying to be unpolitical and loyal to the literal meaning of the budget agreement. He appeared to have no agenda more subtle than trying to hold down Federal spending by putting the Israeli request into a nonemergency category. Under the terms of the budget deal, meeting the request would require cutting somewhere else. One "emergency" could lead to another; aid to Israel could lead to grants to hire unemployment compensation workers, or new aid for veterans.
This is really the closest thing to a controversy Mr. Darman has got into this year on the Hill, a far cry from his experiences in 1989 and 1990. In 1989 the Democrats were furious at him because they felt he was using budget talks they had counted on to face the deficits of the Reagan years to do nothing more than push for a capital gains tax cut.
That problem largely solved itself in 1990, when he supported tax increases, but that infuriated most House Republicans.
This year he has gone out of his way to court his House G.O.P. critics. Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the G.O.P. leader and a target of some of the same wrath Mr. Darman felt, praised the director for spending time giving House Republicans an unusually thorough advance look at the budget. "He's tried to level with them," Mr. Michel said.
And Representative Newt Gingrich, the Georgian who revolted at the budget deals even though he serves as House G.O.P. whip, credited Mr. Darman with "moving toward a more conservative position."
The budget message, Mr. Gingrich said, "had everything a reform-oriented Republican could ask for," with its themes of turning some Federal programs over to the states, encouraging ownership in public housing, and limiting Federal aid, in a few programs, for those with high incomes.
Those same ideas drew some very hostile questioning early last month from two House Democrats who share Mr. Darman's reputation for a high I.Q.: Representatives Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Jim Cooper of Tennessee.
Each had only five minutes for interrogation. Mr. Frank insisted that the Federal aid cuts accomplished little and were not really focused on the rich, and kept interrupting Mr. Darman's replies to get more questions in. Mr. Darman didn't like it and was hardly mollified when the committee chairman, Leon V. Panetta of California, tried to explain that "whoever discusses things with Mr. Frank only gets one word in for every four words he says."
Then came Mr. Cooper, with suspicions that Mr. Darman, by suggesting that some programs not pay the well-off, "would be undercutting the national consensus that has built and preserved these programs." Mr. Darman said that wasn't his purpose, but Mr. Cooper pressed on, asking why there were no means tests for tax breaks that helped the rich. That was too much for the director. Mr. Darman allowed that "a lot of times it takes me a lot of energy to keep my natural tendencies under proper control at the witness table." He said he did not respect Mr. Cooper's challenge to his purposes and lectured him, as he had Mr. Frank, telling him to check with people who had been on the committee longer than they had to learn more of his good motives.
In some ways it was a classic performance. He did answer the substantive questions, among the most thoughtful in a hearing where a lot of members were concerned about how the budget affected much narrower constituencies, but he also showed a thin skin and demanded acknowledgments of respect.
Has he mellowed? Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who chairs the Senate Budget Committee and says he likes Mr. Darman, coyly responds, "I find Dick Darman just as charming this year as he has been in the past."

Where Have All the Jobs Gone? Follow the Crab Grass

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
ENCASED in the millions of statistics the Census Bureau is releasing on what America looked like in 1990 are a few big mysteries about this decade.
What the data show is that the United States is becoming ever more a suburban nation. For the first time a majority of Americans lives within 39 metropolitan areas of a million residents or more. There is unparalleled growth in jobs and population away from the confines of the old central cities. 
 Among the things that this shift seems to portend is a national labor gap, in which the employers have distanced themselves from the employable, the poor minority group population that will comprise the largest pool of new workers in the coming decade.
When the next census is taken in the year 2000, some of the key questions will be: Did the minorities move to the suburbs? Did the jobs move back to the cities? Or did American society find some other solution to the dilemma it created for itself in the 1980's?
Starting in the mid-1970's and then at an ever faster pace in the 1980's, former bedroom communities were converted into major economic centers. The results are clearly evident in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area, where there are now five suburbs with populations greater than 100,000.
"Cheaper land available in large tracts and easy access to a Dallas-Fort Worth airport has meant that some suburbs have been steadily expanding their employment base in manufacturing by 17 or 18 percent over the past 20 years while the city of Dallas has lost more than a quarter of its manufacturing jobs," said Bernard Weinstein, director of the Center for Economic Development and Research at the University of North Texas.
The same has happened in the San Francisco Bay area, Orange County, Calif., and the environs of Atlanta, but it is not just a Sunbelt phenomenon. Gleaming new plants to produce high-tech gizmos sprouted in a broad crescent around Boston and in some of New York City's suburbs.
"What this is about is families," said Florence Shapiro, Mayor of Plano, Tex., a Dallas suburb that is among the fastest growing cities in the nation.
"We have a lot of young couples who were go-getters in the 1980's," she said, "and they wanted to raise their children with others who enjoyed the same life style and the same values and they wanted good schools and they didn't want to worry about crime. After they started coming here, the jobs followed."
The nation's new suburban cities are products of the same impetus that has led the white middle class away from the cities since the 1950's. Despite the arrival of some blacks and Hispanic residents, the suburbs remain far whiter than the urban cores. They continue to offer better schools, less crime and usually a lighter tax burden. Their appeal continues to be that they are a world apart.
As a second generation of Americans, the children of the baby boomers, is reared in the suburbs, challenges arise from the changing geography. The suburbs have developed as a separate culture in America. In the 1980's they captured political power as a main constituency for the political shift to conservatism, and they began to amass economic power by becoming employment centers. But they are not self-sufficient.
Entrenched in the suburbs, the baby boomers in the 1980's grabbed the lion's share of new jobs as white women joined the labor force. But the baby boom is peaking as a contributor of new workers. In the 1990's, it will be the large, poor minority groups that will have to start filling the ranks.
A growing number of city politicians, business and minority group leaders and labor market experts find that an unbridgeable gulf is developing between work places in predominately white suburbs and the inner-city neighborhoods.
"For the disadvantaged in America the three great symbols of social opportunity have been the Statue of Liberty, the Underground Railroad and the covered wagon," said John D. Kasarda, director of the Center for Competitiveness and Employment Growth at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Professor Kasarda argues that the genius of the ever changing American economy has been its ability to move workers, including those in the lowest wage categories, to where new jobs were being created. This has been true, he says, whether it was immigrants crossing the Atlantic, blacks streaming from the rural South to the urban North or settlers heading West.
"Throughout our history spatial mobility and economic mobility have gone hand in hand," he said. "Now for the first time that connection has been broken."
He argues that inner-city residents, already beset with disadvantages, are now further separated from the best economic opportunities by the logistical and financial burdens of traveling to suburban work places. Also playing a role, he says, are discrimination and social welfare programs, like public housing projects, which have anchored the poor to core areas.
Some experts who have rejected this emphasis on geography in the past now view it more favorably given what happened in the 1980's. For example, David Ellwood, a prominent Harvard economist, coined a much-cited phrase in a paper he wrote in 1986: "It doesn't seem to be space; it's race." He now says: "I am starting to see some real disadvantages coming from the movement of jobs to the suburbs. There is no question that in the 1980's it aggravated the problems of the urban poor."
Professor Ellwood views geography as one factor in the isolation of the most disadvantaged in society.
"There's a structural change and the location of jobs is part of it," he says, "but so is the location of good school systems and the location of people who work and can share information about jobs. Living in the ghetto is detrimental not just because there are no jobs down the street but because there are no people down the street with jobs."
When all the census results are in, it will be possible to make precise measurements of the distance between declining urban neighborhoods and new suburban factories. But, in the 1990's the distance will be measured not just in miles but also in skills that go untransmitted, in knowledge of opportunities that go unshared and in a labor force that grows only with great effort.

On the Edge, In the Lands That Wrote The Book

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN addition to good wines and cheeses, rousing folk music and rich poetry, the Balkans have given the world the term "Balkanization" -- for the breakup of countries along ethnic lines into antagonistic fragments.
Employed originally a century ago to describe what was happening to the moribund Ottoman Empire's possessions in southeastern Europe, with its 70 million people and bewildering quilt of nationalities and religions, the term has acquired new currency in recent weeks as parts of the region threaten to go over the brink. 
 The most extreme case is Yugoslavia, a federation of six republics that started life at the end of World War II as a centrally controlled Communist state. It is now a fragile shell displaying numerous cracks, with two northern republics talking of breaking away.
 Late last month, Slovenia's democratically elected parliament adopted legislation permitting it to "disassociate" from Yugoslavia. Within hours, Croatia's parliament approved legislation giving its own laws supremacy over the laws of the federation.
Some politicians in these republics are floating the idea of "two Yugoslavias," while a third variant might simply be no Yugoslavia at all -- with the country replaced by a gaggle of Balkanized entities locked in mutual hostility.
On Friday, leaders of five of the six republics convened in Belgrade in an attempt to solidify a consensus on basic finance and banking measures needed to extricate a whole Yugoslavia from its Communist economic heritage. Croatia's President, Franjo Tudjman, boycotted the meeting, while Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic, stubbornly continued to pursue the chauvinistic policies that set off the Balkanization threat in the first place.
Another uncertainty is the role of the Yugoslav National Army, recruited from all republics but dominated by officers from Serbia. Would they stand idle if the federation collapsed?
New strains have appeared in other Balkan countries, most notably Albania, the poorest nation of Europe. After 46 years under the twin shadows of Stalinist rule and self-imposed isolation, Albania is now staggering -- with incidents of bloodshed -- toward democracy. Multiparty elections are scheduled for March 31.
Were it a matter alone for the 3.5 million citizens under the Tirana regime, the current tumult in Albania would not matter so much for the rest of the region. But in neighboring Yugoslavia there are close to 3 million ethnic Albanians, most subjected to severe political repression in Serbia. A breakup of federal Yugoslavia would automatically heighten aspirations of these 6 million ethnic brothers to join hands across the mountain-ringed borders.
As if to underline that old Albanian ideal, Ibrahim Rugova, head of the Kosovo Democratic Alliance, the largest political formation of Albanians in Yugoslavia, visited Tirana last week. His meetings with President Ramiz Alia, the Communist chief, and with leaders of the new democratic opposition parties represented the first time in almost half a century that top-level officials from the two separate regions inhabited by Albanians encountered one another.
The fragility of the infant post-Communist governments of Romania and Bulgaria, both beset by economic misery, must also be included in any accounting of the security situation of the Balkans.
Ethnic minority problems also persist in Romania, with its 1.5 million Hungarians, and in Bulgaria, with its 1 million Turks. Even Greece, the only country in the region that is a member of the European Community, has barely disguised minority problems.
Balkan derives from the Turkish word for mountain; in 1808, a German geographer, believing that Bulgaria's Balkan Mountains stretched across the whole region, coined the term Balkan Peninsula. In the shortened form, "the Balkans," it stuck.
Nationality conflicts gave rise early in the century to the phrase "Balkan powder keg." The region was, after all, the site of the first and second Balkan Wars and, with the assassination in Sarajevo of the Austrian Archduke in 1914, was the place where World War I was ignited.
The difference between then and now is that at the beginning of the century, the great powers of the day -- all European -- were engaged in keen rivalry over the Balkans. That wrestling over spheres of interest had a softer echo in the cold war contest between the Western powers and the Soviet Union, whose influence and empire include much of the Balkans.
Today, the Soviet Union is so preoccupied with its own internal threat of Balkanization that it seemed almost relieved to sign off last week on the end of the Warsaw Pact, the military alliance that also had its Balkan components. Nor does any other great power covet parts or the whole of the Balkans.
Still, the possibility of Yugoslavia's collapse is deeply troubling not only for its seven immediate neighbors (four in the Balkans), but for the entire continent and for the United States, which is deeply committed to the integrity of Yugoslavia.
It would be the first breakup of a European state since the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, setting a poor precedent at a time when all of Europe is supposed to be coming together.
Optimists may take comfort in the fact that nobody outside Yugoslavia is prepared to welcome its separate parts into the European family. Besides, as Vice President Zivko Pregl noted in Washington last week, it would take years to terminate or renegotiate federal Yugoslavia's 8,000 international agreements.

Phi Sigma Kappa Loses Its Chapter Over $100,000 Debt

DATELINE: SWARTHMORE, Pa.

 BODY:
The Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity at Swarthmore College has been abolished. College officials expressed doubt about its contribution to the campus after the fraternity ran up about $15,000 in debt for heating and utility services and $85,000 in charges for structural maintenance.
 Even if the fraternity, known officially as the Phi Chapter, could raise the money, it would not be reinstated because it had already missed the Dec. 10 deadline, said Swarthmore's president, David W. Fraser.
 The college changed the locks to the fraternity's house during winter break last month, essentially disbanding the chapter. College policy prohibits fraternities from operating without a house.
 
Two Fraternities Left
 "As far as I'm concerned, the deadline has passed, and the fraternity is no longer a recognized college organization," Mr. Fraser said.
 He added that the fraternity "probably would have been given more time to work out its financial problems" had it contributed more positively to life on campus.
 Phi Sig's demise leaves the college with only two fraternities. Nevertheless some of Phi Sig's 13 members have continued to meet, although a few concede that the fraternity is essentially dispersed. The entire fraternity met last week, but reached no decision on whether to continue functioning.
 The fraternity would have to petition the college for reconsideration as a new organization, Mr. Fraser said.
 Thomas E. Recker, executive vice president of the fraternity's national organization in Indianapolis, said the national group had taken no formal action to close the chapter. "We want to keep the group alive," Mr. Recker said. The chapter, founded in 1906, is one of the fraternity's oldest.
 Tedd Goundie, assistant dean, said the college told the chapter in May that it owed about $15,000 on bills incurred in the last six to 10 years. In addition to the debt, the fraternity would also have to pay about $85,000 to repair decades of structural damages to its house on campus, Mr. Goundie said.
 The college became aware of the debt only after recently hired administrators reviewed old financial records, Mr. Goundie said.
 Bernard M. Berman, the lawyer for the national organization and a 1962 alumnus of Swarthmore's Phi Sig., said the chapter's Alumni Association has paid the bills in the past. However, payment on some portions of the bills stopped yeaars ago, because of disputes over the amounts charged for heating, he said.
 "As individuals, it's not our fault," said one Phi Sig member, Jason Morton. "As an organization, we do owe the money."
 Mr. Morton, a senior English major from Phoenix, MD, conceded that "they've given us numerous second changes, and we didn't make good on any of them."
 John Curran, the chapter's president, said Phi Sig had not known of the accumulating debt until the college told it last year.
 "No one notified us, so we assumed everything was all right," said Mr. Curran, a senior economics major from Wyckoff, N.J. "It was partly our fault, since we should have been closer in touch with the alumni and the school."
 But while the debt might be legitimate, Mr. Curran said, the school had been uncooperative in helping Phi Sig meet its obligations. He said the fraternity had asked for a breakdown of how the debt was incurred but had received no information until well after the deadline.
College officials acknowledged that they failed to see Phi Sig as serving any positive role, except as an organizer of parties.
 Mr. Curran said, however, that the fraternity sponsored a canned food drive last semester and was planning other ventures this semester, before learning of its closing.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Dear Mr. President . . .

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
I didn't try to telephone because I knew you'd be busy. So here's a public communication where candor may be easier than in private conversation with a President, especially one who has actually succeeded at something.
 If you're only reading short adulatory messages, this paragraph constitutes an executive summary: You, your advisers and the fighting men and women of the United States brought great honor to our country in the Persian Gulf. After the celebrations, however, don't expect any deference from Democrats on domestic issues (they'll be righter than ever for having been wrong on the gulf), cooperation from those nations you helped save (they said thank you on Thursday) and further compliments from journalists (we're not in that business). 
 On the war, I was with you 87 percent. The other 13 percent was constructive criticism, most of which you fortunately ignored.
Everybody else, as you now know, was with you 103 percent. Some experts and colleagues would have been with you 105 percent had you been a little tougher and used maybe one very small nuclear weapon, just to make sure they work.
 You have every right to feel like Superman. No President since Truman ended World War II has brought such uncluttered success to America. You have our undying admiration. That and $1 trillion will help you close the deficit.
 Here are some test cases of what's to come in Congress. Say instead of reducing the Pentagon budget, as you promised, you now want increases. Maybe you'll get 20 new Democratic votes, but not enough to win. Say you want a big jump in spending on Star Wars. Perhaps Democrats will give you a few extra million, simply to cover their retreat; no more.
On domestic issues like energy, education, child care and the economy, Democrats will have to be even more rambunctious than before the war. Your dominance in foreign affairs will make it more important for them to distinguish themselves in areas where you haven't done very well and don't seem to care very much.
 It's fair for you to unleash Republican pit bulls to chew up Democrats for being soft on the gulf. It's your party's only chance to gain control of Congress. But you should retain your credibility and never gainsay that the Democrats backed you after they lost the vote to stop you from warring on Iraq. Republicans, when they disagreed with the way the Korean and Vietnam Wars were being fought, abandoned Democratic Presidents.
 Besides Americans, the deepest debt to you is owed by the Kuwaitis, the Saudis, the Israelis and our allies from Egypt to Europe to Japan. Expect even less generosity than from the Democrats.
 The Saudis probably will give you a year's worth of oil at low prices, to show where their hearts are. After that it will be all wallets, once again. Just ask them to sit down at the peace table with Israel.
 Nor will Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir feel he owes you much for dispatching the Patriot missiles to defend Israel against the Scuds. Instead, he is likely to remind you about Palestinians cheering on the Scuds and present his bill for the destruction.
As for the Kuwaitis, don't count on enlightenment. A senior Kuwaiti cabinet minister acknowledged to "60 Minutes," the CBS news program, that the war "has made us know that what we used to do was wrong." For example, he offered, "I had four maids, or three maids in my house; you can have two maids. Why should you have four maids in the house? Why doesn't your wife do some of the work?"
 Yes, indeed, women's liberation comes to Kuwait. Will it be said of these royal gentlemen what was remarked about the Bourbons returning to rule France after the defeat of Napoleon -- that they learned nothing, and forgot nothing?
 Also, our loyal allies still owe us about $40 billion for their share of war expenses. They've paid only a fraction of their pledges, which were far too low to begin with. Yes, it's unbecoming for a world hero to travel hat in hand, but also make sure they don't pay off, as before, in used Sony tape recorders and East German military uniforms. Cash, preferably in Deutsche marks and yen, will do fine.
 Probably the threat to your re-election ended when the cease-fire began last week. But all heroic leaders of democracies should keep in view the fate of Winston Churchill, whom the British loved for leading them toward victory in World War II but whom they voted out of office before war's end for his inattention to Britain. Democracies love their war heroes, but they love their country even more.

HEADLINE: For the Neediest: A New Record

 BODY:
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has received record-breaking contributions for the sixth consecutive year. Generous even in the midst of recession, Americans have responded to the needs of the impoverished and the homeless by donating $4,439,093 to the 79th annual campaign, just ended. This exceeds last year's total by more than $66,000.
It is reassuring that this record was achieved in tough times. Clearly, Americans from many walks of life have responded to the growing desperation of less fortunate citizens. This is generosity and civic responsibility at its most timely. Seldom has the need been greater. 
 Those who contributed to the fund during this campaign, more than 15,500 people in all, deserve thanks. Although the official drive has ended, the needs of the impoverished continue to grow. As in previous years, the fund will continue to operate throughout the year.
Bequests and contributions received from this date forward will be credited to the 80th appeal campaign, which begins officially in December. Contributions will go entirely to those served, with nothing held back for solicitation or administrative purposes.
Contributions are deductible to the extent permitted by law. Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and mailed to Post Office Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087

HEADLINE: From War to Peace

 BODY:
Think of the Middle East as a jigsaw puzzle on a wobbly card table. Saddam Hussein knocked over the table. Now, after the thrillingly quick allied triumph, the pieces are back on the table, leaving the U.S. and its allies with a breathtaking opportunity. But the puzzle needs to be put back together just as quickly.
There's neither time nor reason to reshape the individual puzzle pieces. The gulf war was fought, after all, to uphold sovereign borders, not revise them. What is of transcendent importance, however, as Secretary of State James Baker heads for Middle East meetings this week, is to rebuild the card table. 
 Four sturdy new legs would protect against future shocks. The first need is regional arms limitation, starting with Iraq. The next requirement is a web of peace treaties, explicitly including Israel. Meanwhile, the international community needs to build on the first successful collective security operation in decades. Finally, Mideast governments need to distribute political and economic power more widely.
Curbing the regional arms race. The first concern is to contain Iraq, which until last week had the Middle East's largest and most dangerous army. Most of its offensive capacity seems to have been destroyed, but the continued pressure of U.N. embargoes is needed until Iraq accepts strict, verifiable arms limits.
Regional stability would not be enhanced if a weakened Iraq tempted adventurist neighbors. Regional security guarantees should be buttressed by commitments from arms suppliers like the U.S., the Soviet Union, France, China and Brazil to restrain reckless transfers.
Undefeated Arab states may reasonably resist any arms limitation plan that excludes Israel. But the Shamir Government recently signaled willingness to talk about regional arms control. Such talks could promote wider Arab recognition of Israel.
Fashioning a regional web of treaties. The Kuwait crisis revolutionized Arab political thought, drew Iran back into contact with the world and scrambled Palestinian politics. Arab states resolutely resisted Saddam Hussein's efforts to split the coalition with pro-Palestinian rhetoric and a rain of Scuds. Israel won grudging admiration by refraining from retaliation against Iraq.
The best way to build on this progress is to fashion a regional web of mutual security agreements. It needs to include Israel and be guaranteed by major outside powers. Some Arab states might now be willing to follow Egypt's example and recognize Israel. In return, Israel might offer credible formulas for the exercise of Palestinian political rights and for implementing Security Council resolutions that ordain trading land for peace.
Consolidating and refining collective security. The Kuwait crisis brought the Security Council back to life after 40 years of deadlock. It gave substance to post-cold-war cooperation between Washington and Moscow. But no satisfactory formulas were found for sharing the financial and military burdens of enforcing international law. And in the decisive military phases of the crisis, the U.N. was all but bypassed. The gains now need to be built on, the shortcomings remedied.
Expanding access to political and economic power. Saddam Hussein was able to sacrifice hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in two disastrous wars only by maintaining a fiercely repressive dictatorship. The Arab world is divided, furthermore, between rich gulf monarchies and poorer relations in countries like Jordan, Yemen and Tunisia.
It's not Washington's role to redesign the internal politics of Middle East states. But America has every reason to proclaim and promote democratic values. Where appropriate, it might condition U.S. aid on respect for basic rights.
The U.S. and its allies have achieved much with their bold performance in the gulf war. They have protected Saudi Arabia, liberated Kuwait, created a prototype for collective action and sent a reverberating warning to potential aggressors.
Now, by capitalizing on the diplomatic opportunities, the allies have the chance to transform a famous victory into a historic triumph.

HEADLINE: All About/Medical Supplies;
Removing the Warehouse from Cost-Conscious Hospitals

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
In the palmy years before the nationwide squeeze on health-care costs, St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston kept a hoard of expensive medical supplies in its 20,000-square-foot warehouse. Like all hospitals, St. Luke's cannot afford to run short of vital items -- least of all in the operating rooms. At St. Luke's, Dr. Denton A. Cooley's teams perform open heart surgery on 3,000 patients each year, using prodigious quantities of supplies.
But to achieve economies as the pressure to control costs intensified, St. Luke's shut its warehouse and sold the inventory to Baxter International, a major hospital supplier. Baxter is becoming a full-time partner with this 950-bed hospital in managing, ordering and delivering Baxter's wares as well as the products of 400 other companies. Baxter's daily "just-in-time" deliveries to the hospital loading dock were only the first step. In an innovative system that hospitals call stockless inventory, Baxter fills orders in exact, sometimes small, quantities and delivers directly to departments, including the operating rooms and nursing floors, inside St. Luke's.
At least 50 hospitals buy stockless services from Baxter and a handful of smaller distributors. Converts to the concept are multiplying. About 250 more hospitals will go stockless in at least some departments in the next two years, said Pat Dolan, a partner in Chicago with Arthur Andersen & Company. Dolan recently studied stockless systems for the Health Industry Distributors Association.
 
 
Industry Leaders
Competitors in a $15 Billion Market
The nation's 6,700 hospitals spent $15 billion last year on products like disposable gloves and gowns, sutures and therapeutic solutions. Baxter International, Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories dominate the market. Baxter is the largest manufacturer of hospital supplies, with 29 percent of the market, said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. J. & J.'s share is 11 percent, and Abbott Laboratories has about 10 percent.
Baxter is also the leading distributor, with 28 percent of that market. The company says it makes 70 percent of the products it sells. But Baxter is also a middleman for many of its manufacturing rivals; it is Johnson & Johnson's largest customer for hospital supplies. J. & J.'s hospital products unit makes one-third of its sales directly to hospitals but, unlike Baxter, does not distribute supplies for other companies. Other major suppliers include Owens & Minor Inc. in Glen Allen, Va., with $1.2 billion in 1990 sales; the A. Stuart Company in Greensburg, Pa., with $600 million, and the General Medical Corporation in Richmond, with $340 million, said Mr. Abramowitz.
 
 
Multiple Benefits
'Just-in-Time' Means Less Handling
 Hospital supply expenses only begin with the $15 billion in purchases. "For every dollar spent to buy a product, hospitals spend another dollar moving that product through the system," said David Cassak, hospitals editor with In Vivo Business and Medicine Report, a trade magazine.
Stockless systems lower hospitals' holding and handling costs. "We think we've saved $1.5 million a year since 1988" from just-in-time deliveries alone, said Randy Jackson, a St. Luke's vice president, with another $500,000 likely once the stockless system is fully implemented. Annual savings already have included $350,000 from reducing staff and $162,500 from eliminating inventory. The hospital has converted storeroomsto patient care and other money-generating uses.
Vernon R. Loucks Jr., Baxter's chairman, said the company is introducing the stockless service, which it calls Valuelink, at 17 large hospitals. "We walk very carefully and slowly, because we can't afford a glitch," he said. "The first morning that an operating room doesn't open, we've got a problem."
The distributors profit from stockless services because they impose extra charges, raise prices more readily and often become a hospital's sole source of medical supplies. They typically add 3 percent to 5 percent service fees. "Our price might be slightly higher than what the hospital used to pay us, but their total cost is reduced," said Glenn Dozier, the chief financial officer with Owens & Minor, whose major stockless client is the huge medical center of the University of California at Los Angeles.
By helping hospitals reduce costs through computerized ordering, just-in-time deliveries and stockless services, suppliers have been able to raise their prices by at least 5 percent per year. They have withstood pressure from Government and private insurers and the buying clout of groups like Volunteer Hospitals, which has 600 member hospitals and 190 affiliates. Mr. Abramowitz said the hospital supply market is growing by about 8 percent a year; Baxter's sales growth in 1991 will be about 11 percent. "Stockless is Baxter's most exciting growth opportunity," he said.
Mr. Loucks said stockless services benefit both sides. "We generally take about 30 percent of whatever is saved," he said. "The hospital is picking up 70 percent."
A medical supply company does not have to be Baxter's size to exploit these opportunities. Even before Baxter jumped in, smaller suppliers like the privately held Koley's Medical Supply Inc. in Omaha were providing stockless service to a handful of customers beginning in the mid-1980's. Michael P. Gittings, Koley's president, said 18 hospitals, mostly small and all within 200 miles of Omaha, buy the service. He said Koley's sales rose to $38 million this year, compared with $6 million in 1984, before it introduced the service. Being near at hand and relatively small helped Koley's make the service work. "The hospitals have a very strong trust relationship with us," Mr. Gittings said.
 
 
Concern Over Conflicts
Most Hospitals Remain Skeptical
 The overwhelming majority of the nation's hospitals still shun stockless services. Some administrators fear that suppliers would write themselves larger orders than the hospitals needed. Administrators say group buying organizations already give them deep discounts. "Some hospitals would not want non-employees working in sensitive areas like ordering supplies," said Dwight Winstead, president of the VHA Supply Company, the buying unit of Voluntary Hospitals of America. Administrators of hospitals that belong to the VHA are wary of becoming hens opening the door to an eager fox, he said. "They feel there could be a conflict between supplying and servicing stockless and a corporate strategy to move products," he explained.
Some suppliers say hospitals must be on guard to realize the potential savings. "Hospitals that don't have the internal systems and controls to manage it will be in trouble," said Frank J. Ryan, president of Johnson & Johnson Hospital Services, a unit of J.& J.
Hospitals also need to see whether the savings from going stockless are greater than the extra charges. "You have to find the happy medium where the price of the product doesn't exceed the need for the service," said Jerome L. Stracke, an assistant vice president at the Evanston Hospital in Illinois.
One hospital may have found a way to realize many of the benefits from new delivery systems without the risks. The independent St. Paul-Ramsey Medical Center in St. Paul, Minn., requires Baxter and two other suppliers to bid against each other. All three provide just-in-time deliveries to the loading dock, but the hospital takes charge of internal distribution. Michael I. Kerr, St. Paul-Ramsey's support services director, said this system keeps prices and inventory costs low, with the hospital staying in control of its supplies. Last year, as the cost of medical supplies rose nationally by 4 percent to 6 percent, his hospital's costs increased only 3 percent.
 
 
 
'PARTNERS' IN INVENTORY CONTROL
 Steve Seide, a general manager in Houston with Baxter International, and Dave Render, his operations manager, meet every day with nurses and executives in two local hospitals. "We talk about everything from a request to stock the new Diet Dr. Pepper to a complaint that a pest control truck is taking too long at the loading dock," Mr. Render said.
Mr. Seide and Mr. Render run a service that Baxter calls Valuelink at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital and Hermann Hospital. Under this stockless system, Baxter fills precise orders for supplies and delivers them just as they are needed, directly to the departments that place the orders.
"We have become their warehouse, their central supply -- we're it," Mr. Seide said. As the hospitals phase in the stockless system, he said, "all they will have left is two to three days of supplies. Then it's all up to us."
Among other economies, stockless service has enabled Hermann Hospital to eliminate a 68,000-square-foot warehouse and St. Luke's to get rid of a 20,000-square-foot warehouse. Baxter keeps enough supplies for both institutions in an automated warehouse with only 44,000 square feet.
Baxter has used the stockless system to become a virtual partner with St. Luke's and Hermann in managing their supply flow. "We formed teams in the hospital units, with leaders and steering committees to deal with problems," Mr. Render said.
Mr. Seide said Baxter can tailor its services according to the wishes of a hospital's staff. "Seventy percent of it is good communications," he said. Based on a suggestion from the operating rooms, Baxter became part of the telephone voice mail system at St. Luke's. Anyone in an operating room can dial the letters RSVP to reach the company.
A suggestion by an operating room nurse at St. Luke's has helped Baxter prevent surgical mix-ups. Mr. Seide said she had noticed that Baxter's blue labels on pentalyte liquid, used to moisten and clean surgical incisions, closely resembled the blue labels on sterile water. Baxter, which says it was already planning to remedy the problem, promptly started putting black labels on pentalyte.
Mr. Seide and Mr. Render have good reasons for boasting of their progress at Hermann and St. Luke's. They are hoping to attract other Houston hospitals to their service. Analysts say that the more hospitals join, the greater the economies for Baxter.

HEADLINE: New York Area Grows Fastest At Its Fringes

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
Until about five years ago, the John Deere dealership in Goshen, N.Y., sold mostly farm equipment. But as some barns and silos gave way to offices and shopping plazas and wooded ridges sprouted subdivisions, it has been selling fewer hay balers -- and more lawn mowers and snow blowers.
For N. Daniel Dunitz, the dealership's vice president and general manager, it is one more bittersweet sign that the landscape, though still largely undeveloped, is changing. 
 Mr. Dunitz, whose family has been supplying farms in the area for decades, says he sometimes has to go out of his way these days just to pass a working farm. But at least that way he can also avoid the traffic, another symptom of the encroaching suburbanism that some regard as if it were an infectious disease.
In Orange County and the other counties in the outer ring of the New York metropolitan region, the 1980's were a decade of growth and growth pains, a time when the balance between open spaces and the desire of people to fill them became harder to strike.
In the 80's, the Census Bureau reports, 13 of these outer counties, from Litchfield in northwestern Connecticut to Ulster and Sullivan in New York to Monmouth and Ocean in central New Jersey, added a total of 332,434 people, an increase of 13 percent.
In contrast, the metropolitan region's other 18 counties, which have more than 80 percent of its population, added 319,766 people, an increase of just 2 percent. The metropolitan region overall grew 3.4 percent, to 19.8 million people, the Census found.
Many counties in the inner ring of suburbs, including Nassau and Bergen, lost population in the 1980's, the Census Bureau found. New York City, which had a surge of foreign immigration, grew by 3.5 percent, though city officials and others contend that the Federal count missed many residents.
Planners and economists say the surge of growth at the fringe is evidence of the region's continuing decentralization -- of jobs as well as people.
"It's a relentless process," said Richard T. Anderson, president of the Regional Plan Association, an independent research organization.
 
At a Price?
 Though Nassau and Bergen Counties lost 54,000 people in the last decade, they still added nearly 275,000 new jobs, an indication of their transition from bedroom communities to employment centers in their own right.
Many of the new suburban jobs are being filled by commuters from the outer ring. But counties like Orange are attracting more jobs now, too, and even developing their own business centers, complete with services from consulting firms to hotels to copying shops.
Mr. Anderson and other planners worry that decentralization will mean a sprawl gobbling up forests and overwhelming highways.
And if, as seems likely, the outer counties continue to grow, some planners are also concerned that their prosperity could come at the expense of New York City, with which these counties will increasingly compete. As more and more of the region's housing and jobs are located along its edge, the gulf between the urban poor and well-to-do suburbanites is also likely to widen.
Still, Rosemary Scanlon, chief economist of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said she believed that the dispersion of people from urban areas will continue, although it will not necessarily mean that urban areas will not grow.
"I think there'll be a flight to smaller cities and counties all across the country, " she said. "People are just moving, getting away."
 
$1,000 a Mile
 If Orange County, which begins 40 miles north of the George Washington Bridg, is typical, the new residents of New York's outer ring are much like the last generation of suburbanites: married, with children, they are leaving behind crowds, crime and questionable schools for extra bedrooms and backyards. But, priced out of the inner ring of suburbs, they are moving farther and farther out.
The rule of thumb, said Christopher J. Dunleavy, executive director of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce, is that housing prices rise roughly $1,000 for every mile one moves southeasterly toward the Rockland border. And comparable houses in Orange County cost half of what they would in Westchester and Bergen Counties, he added.
When a county's population rises, jobs and development follow, though the process is complicated and often lags. Some outer counties are already showing evidence of labor shortages, particularly Somerset and Hunterdon in New Jersey, where in December the unemployment rates were 3.2 percent and 3.1 percent respectively, and Rockland, Putnam and Dutchess in New York, with unemployment rates of 3.6 percent, 3.7 percent and 3.8 percent in December, the last month for which statistics were available. This shortage could dampen future job growth.
Parts of the outer ring seem so vibrant that the economic recession that is so visible in the city and the inner suburbs is not much in evidence.
"A lot of the surrounding counties see themselves as much more independent of New York than they once did," said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"That perception has some reality to it," he added, "but I think they tend to underestimate the amount of continuing economic ties that they have to New York City."
Still, while parts of the city, and much of the region, are glutted with vacant offices, Mr. Dunleavy said Orange County may actually run out of space this year.
Toward the north end of the county is Stewart Airport, where commercial flights began about a year ago and a handful of airlines now operate. Nearby office and industrial parks are filling.
In the county's south is Sterling Forest, where there are plans for what Mr. Dunleavy said is the largest development project in the works in the Northeast -- 14,000 houses and more than 5 million square feet of commercial and industrial space -- on the largest single piece of developable land in the metropolitan region.
In the center of the county, Empire Blue Cross-Blue Shield is moving into what Mr. Dunleavy says is the biggest commercial office building between the Bronx and Montreal, though the sprawling brick structure has been designed in a way that does not call attention to its size.
 
'Needs to Be Slowed'
 But prosperity has its price. Mr. Dunitz of Gor-Dun's Inc., the John Deere dealership in Goshen, said Orange County has lost perhaps 30,000 of the 145,000 acres of farmland it had 15 years ago, along with many of the people who tilled them. Fortunately for him, John Deere has expanded its line of consumer products.
"For some reason we have to have growth," he said. "That seems to be the position. But I think it needs to be controlled. I think it needs to be slowed."
The vast majority of the county's land is still undeveloped. But Mr. Dunleavy worries that Orange County will repeat what he regards as the mistakes of Westchester and Bergen, either by forcing developers to put each new home on several acres, which would consume precious fields, or by clustering row houses too densely and in the wrong places, without adequate visual or environmental buffers.
 
'Seen as a Negative'
 "What we fear most is the kind of suburban sprawl that we see in more immediate parts of the metropolitan region," he said.
"There is literally not a single soul on the political spectrum who wants us to become a bedroom community," he said. "That's universally seen as a negative."
More families mean more children mean more schools mean higher taxes. That has been a problem for Warwick, in the southeast corner of the county, and other towns where residential has outpaced commercial development.
Some towns have water supply problems, and the entire county is projected to be 20 million gallons a day short of water by 2010, Mr. Dunleavy said. Sewage treatment is another concern.
Orange County is served by three major highways -- the New York State Thruway, Route 17 and Route 84 -- that are helping to make it a distribution center. Similarly, in Hunterdon County, corporations have opened research and office centers along Interstate 78.
But the surge of growth in parts of the outer ring is already causing backups that are bound to get worse. Transportation experts say the number of trips in and between these counties will grow at a faster rate than commutes to and from New York City, and the new patterns of travel do not lend themselves to new mass transit lines, assuming that money were available to build them.
 
A New Los Angeles?
 "The historical settlement pattern was fairly compact -- villages, towns and cities organized around rail lines," said Robert D. Yaro, senior vice president of the Regional Plan Association. "But for the last couple of generations, we've been building a Los Angeles-type region. A lot of the problems are being driven by that."
Mr. Yaro is now at work on a new regional plan, the third vision of the future his organization has devised in 60 years. Like a martial arts expert, he is seeking not to meet development head on but to deflect it, guiding it into patterns that conserve resources.
To make his point, Mr. Yaro has prepared a series of aerial views of typical suburban locations comparing what would happen if growth and development continue to sprawl, and what would happen if they were shaped according to the association's principles.
One image, based on a Connecticut town, shows a downtown filled with shopping malls and blotches of half-filled parking lots that stretch to the horizon. The companion view shows a town with even more buildings, but clustered together and separated by tree-lined streets -- a modern suburban village.
"The goal is to have more effective planning in all three states," Mr. Yaro said. "With 900 municipalities, we just can't expect all of them to be headed in the right direction."
The renderings will be unveiled next month, at a regional assembly the organization is holding. After that, Mr. Yaro said, "we'll be taking these images on the road."

I noticed, right off, that on the playground or in the halls, or even in the classroom itself, the children were often marvelously forceful and vigorous storytellers. But when they were asked to write, they commonly became inarticulate, even fearfully so. "I can't write," was their refrain, and I decided not to take them up directly on that claim.
 Instead, I turned the English class into an informal art seminar. I brought in slides, fed them into a projector, and we all looked at Picassos and Pissarros, Remingtons and Renoirs, and nearer home, John Sloans and Edward Hoppers. I noticed that Hopper's paintings, especially, both excited and puzzled the children. I also noticed that they wanted to connect what they saw to stories, which they constructed as I flashed one Hopper slide after another against the wall. It was almost as if this 20th-century American realist painter (who died only 23 years ago) somehow addressed these children, prompted in them a desire to respond to his pictures by telling of their various experiences. 
 I remember, especially, some personal tales told by those children in response to the more familiar Hopper paintings. I remember the girl who said of the "folks" who figure in "Nighthawks" (three customers at a food counter in the middle of the night, being served by a waiter): "They have a different day -- I mean, night. Night is their day. Maybe something is on their minds, and they can't sleep -- but maybe they just work at night, like my mom does." Her mother runs a Dunkin Donuts shop on the 11-to-7 shift. "She says she has a good time talking with some of the people, and they have a good time talking with her. She says people talk more at night -- or maybe it's that night people talk more. It's easier then."
 Other Hopper paintings prompted an almost universal chorus of perplexity or apprehension. Pictures like "Sunday," in which a man sits, arms folded, in front of stores that seem empty, abandoned, or "Approaching a City," in which tenement buildings hover over subway tracks that head underground, stirred the children to anxious questions, to gloomy statements about not only the content of the slides but their own lives as well.
"That's a funny one," said one girl. "It's weird -- it's spooky." The emphasis on that last word said it all for the whole class -- nods, several "yeah's," and the fidgeting that is more telling, at times, than any words. In their own way, these children may have been circling around the thoughts I was entertaining -- the grim, sinister, dangerous side of urban life, maybe even that aspect of our psychological life: the electric third rail, the dark underground that looms before the viewer.
 In "Approaching a City," a mood of stark stillness dominates; in the better-known "Early Sunday Morning," with its storefronts, and above them, tenement apartments, with its street hydrant and old-fashioned barber pole, a serene stillness is offered -- the city sleeps, as it should on the morning of the week's seventh day. Such pictures prompt the children to ask about people: where are they or, better, why are they left out?
 At that point, I was ready with some pictures in which human beings are given a more intimate kind of attention: "Office at Night," or "Hotel Room," or "Hotel by a Railroad," or "Sunlight in a Cafeteria" or "Automat," or "The Barber Shop." The result, however, is often further unease. A boy tells me: "The people don't seem happy. Their heads seem bent. Either they're alone, or if they're with someone, they don't look at each other. No one is smiling." A chorus of agreement -- though a girl demurs: "Just because they're not smiling doesn't mean they're unhappy. I think they're thinking."
 That line of reasoning evoked much discussion. Some children pointed out that in several pictures Hopper's women look "sexy" but his men seem cold, buttoned up, self-preoccupied -- or, as in the dramatic "Excursion Into Philosophy," of a man seated on a bed, introspectively tied to reading matter rather than connected to a woman who is lying nearby, her back (with its exposed bottom) to him. Others expressed indirectly their sense of the confinement of those urban rooms and offices, the frustrations of the people who inhabit them, through urgently stated therapeutic recommendations: "Those people should get out and go take a long walk in the country; then they could unwind."
 This high-strung, tense, self-preoccupied side to certain of Hopper's American city dwellers, office workers, travelers, doesn't yield, unfortunately, to the remedy suggested by that 9-year-old child. I follow her advice, in a way -- we move to Hopper's suburban and rural world.
If anything, things get worse away from the downtown streets. In "East Wind Over Weehawken," no one is in sight, but a large "For Sale" sign tells of a collapsed economy. (The picture was painted in 1934.) In "Ryder House," a field of grass is overgrown near a house whose windows are boarded up -- a forlorn, abandoned farm.
In "Cape Cod Evening," overgrown grass again surrounds a house whose two occupants, a man and a woman, are outside, grimly stoic, their dog turned away from them. Even more threatening, a dark cluster of nearby trees seems on the march, ready to overwhelm a rural scene already stifled, uncompromising. The woman's crossed arms, her dark blue dress, the man's T-shirt -- this is a bedraggled, woebegone couple, as the children recognize.
Again, rather than analyzing and explicating, they suggest action: "Let's go back to the city -- that restaurant, where there was the food, or to the movie one." The boy who said that was referring to "Tables for Ladies," which features a couple eating, a cashier, and a worker arranging a display of fruit, and to "New York Movie," which emphasizes not a film or its audience, but a pensive usherette who stands aside under some light.
 In the former, however, the viewer is outside the restaurant, maybe hungry (the picture was painted in 1930, as the Great Depression deepened), and in the latter the viewer is asked to think of someone who is, literally, outside a particular mainstream: others lose themselves in a few hours of film distraction, while the one who has helped them get to their seats, who has been, in a way, an instrument of their subsequent pleasure, is left to stand apart -- left to her own, isolated, personal resources.
 To return to the city, we need gas, I remind the children by showing them Hopper's "Four Lane Road" and "Gas" -- but again, a couple in the former, running a gas station, seem out of touch with each other, and without customers, big as the road is, whereas the latter poses yet another of those dark, encroaching forests next to a Mobil station tended by a man who is alone as evening settles upon a carless road, this one narrow and headed obliquely into the dark. No wonder these children have become restless -- and, finally, have resigned themselves to the realization that all does not go well in Hopper's America: an alienation of individuals, one from the other, and too, a good deal of social and economic dislocation, distress.
 When I use Hopper's slides with Harvard college students, only a few blocks away, a different emphasis can often be heard. I teach a seminar titled "American Light," named after a wonderful poem written by E. L. Sissman. It is meant to honor Hopper's shrewd eye for much of what takes place in our country, as well as his extraordinary way with light and darkness -- a cold, even supernatural glow, often given intensity and prominence by a nearby stretch of darkness in the form of shadows cast by buildings or by trees.
 We look at the same slides the elementary school children do, but we also read and discuss Raymond Carver's fiction, his brilliantly constructed, emotionally piercing stories, in so many of which a failure of communication, of human understanding, figures so prominently. The loneliness of his characters, their down-and-out state becomes transfigured by the genius of this writer into the greatness of one compelling, dramatic moment after another. The students respond with feeling as well as intellectually to Carver -- examine his texts, but also let themselves personally enter and walk their way, open-eyed, through his narratives.
 Yet, with respect to Hopper, they are wont to favor analysis of his pictures: shapes, sizes, forms, arrangements of objects, nature of pigment, contrasts of color -- all noted with big-deal words like chiaroscuro coming up now and then. Yes, I think, this is important, to learn "critical skills," but we sometimes go further, hasten to question common truths entertained outside the academy: "Too much is made of the loneliness and alienation in Hopper," a student announced. Maybe so, I think.
 In Hopper, we begin to realize, there is a 20th-century sensibility at work: his often explicit interest in a documentary art that tells of a nation not at ease with itself, and individuals not at ease with one another.
 To be sure, Hopper's paintings lend themselves especially well to the viewer's inclinations -- in the tradition of Rorschach cards or, better, Henry Murray's "Thematic Apperception" pictures, they tell about us viewers, as opposed to an American "them." The elusive ambiguities of those paintings are fodder for our conflicts and worries, for the constant complexities of feeling within us that struggle for expression and find it in our dreams (our own private, nightly art) as well as in the pictures to which we become attached, and to which we make our various personal attributions. Still, Hopper remarked, in connection with "Nighthawks," that he "simplified the scene a great deal and made the restaurant bigger" than the one in Greenwich Village in New York City that he used as a model of sorts. He went on to say: "Unconsciously, probably, I was painting the loneliness of a large city." In our university sanctuary, we read those words, look again at his various railroad tracks slicing through the land, his empty drugstores and bleak bridges, his eerie country houses or massive tenement blocks, his hotel lobbies and roadside gas pumps, and begin to realize that this was an artist whose unconscious knew well not only how to supply energy to a wonderfully gifted talent, but also knew well how many Americans, at least some of the time, both live and feel.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Daniel Pyne Did It: 'The Hard Way'

BYLINE: By BETSY SHARKEY; Betsy Sharkey is an editor of Adweek and an entertainment columnist for the magazine M Inc.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
What first intrigued the writer Daniel Pyne about "The Hard Way," a comedy thriller that is as much a sendup of the way Hollywood perceives the real world as it is a story of cops and bad guys, was the idea of trying to fashion a parody with some depth, rather than a predictable cliche.
The movie, starring Michael J. Fox and James Woods and opening on Friday, is a collision of characters built around a simple "what if" premise. In this case, what if an intensely driven New York cop (Mr. Woods) hot on the trail of a serial killer is forced to baby-sit a pampered Hollywood movie star (Mr. Fox), who is out to research a role? 
 The result is a clash of the ultimate reality with the ultimate illusion, played on a verbal tightrope of dialogue that works a bit like a Robin Williams comedy routine -- breathlessly, relentlessly and rarely without purpose.
"The toughest problem was figuring out a fresh way to portray an actor who wasn't a Hollywood in-joke," says the 35-year-old Mr. Pyne, whose open Lincolnesque face and quietly intelligent discomfort with conventional wisdom make him seem an embodiment of naivete and insight -- a "Mr. Smith Goes to Hollywood," instead of Washington.
"I wanted to create an actor as a real person, not an actor as some writer's simplistic, stripped-down version," he says. "The Preston Sturges film 'Sullivan's Travels' was an inspiration in that regard, because the character had a bit more depth than the typical Hollywood producer-director. The cop was easy, because I'd been writing cops and had a definite opinion of the difference between what a movie cop was and what a real cop is like."
Indeed, Mr. Pyne's first real paying job in Hollywood was "writing cops," when, in the early 80's, he was hired as a story editor on the first season of the NBC network series "Miami Vice." There he rewrote and wrote original scripts about two undercover detectives who are remembered as much for the way they dressed as the way they solved crimes.
Mr. Pyne went on to conceive and write "Hard Copy," a short-lived CBS drama about journalists. That was followed by an experimental, pseudodocumentary series, "The Street," which he describes as being "all about deconstructing, going against the traditional narrative, going against the traditional cop show and yet finding something that would hook people to watch it at 12:30 at night." The show, syndicated by MCA, lasted for 40 episodes.
But it is his work on "The Hard Way" that has turned Mr. Pyne into one of Hollywood's busiest writers. For Mr. Fox, he has since rewritten "Doc Hollywood," a comedy currently in production. He recently completed an adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's classic 1954 film, "The Seven Samurai," for Brian De Palma. "White Sands," a political thriller and an original screenplay, is set to go into production later this year for Morgan Creek, which also produced another of Mr. Pyne's scripts, the 1990 film "Pacific Heights."
His comedy about American football in Italy, "Winning Ugly," is in development at M-G-M-Pathe. And he is the writer and executive producer of "The Antagonist," a pilot for CBS whose style is reminiscent of Mr. Kurosawa's "Rashomon" in its exploration of different truths. "The Antagonist" will be televised this spring.
When Mr. Pyne discusses his film and television work, he tends to do so in literary terms. When he talks about how his fascination with the American legal system led him to create "The Antagonist," he likens his interest to "the way that Kafka was fascinated with the legal system."
"I write a lot about certain themes," he says, as he balances his 9-month-old daughter, Katie, on his knee, in the living room of his home in Los Angeles. "Moral man in an amoral world, relationships between people and how culture and society impact upon them, and identity, characters in search of themselves."
Even his method of writing tends to more closely parallel that of a novelist rather than a screenwriter. He does not structure his scripts initially. If a particular structure is there, it is not by design. The scenes are highly detailed rather than skeletal and, at least at first, don't conform to a screenplay's world of interiors and exteriors. "I think of characters and of beginnings," he says. "But generally I imagine the character in the broadest outline. Then, when I start to write them, they become defined. I know that I'm on the right track when the character begins to take over the story and I'm following the character rather than pushing the character around on the page."
On his own, Mr. Pyne believes that he never would have come up with a movie like "The Hard Way." "I'm not a high-concept writer," he says. Left to his own devices, he prefers darker, more complex themes that explore a more cynical side of life. He says he loves living in Los Angeles because it is a "multicultural, teeming, ugly cesspool" that provides an unending supply of good characters.
He and his wife, Joan, a musician, take road trips to soak up and absorb reality. He'll come away from a trip with an idea, write 10 pages, then pack it away for a year to see how well it wears, as he did in the case of "White Sands." "White Sands," the first original movie script he tried to sell, was widely turned down.
"There were complaints that it was too hard to read," he says. "It took two hours, and a lot of people in town don't want to spend two hours reading anything." The initial reaction to "White Sands" encouraged him to write "Pacific Heights," set in San Francisco, where he and his wife have another home they escape to on occasion. "I wanted to prove to myself that I could do something very lean and readable," says Mr. Pyne. "I thought it would make a nice, small movie. When I finished it, I gave it to my agent, and he thought it was a little dark but that he might be able to sell it. It sold in a day."
While Mr. Pyne seems to have a penchant for drama rather than comedy, the producer William Sackheim, who worked with Mr. Pyne on "Hard Copy," was convinced that "The Hard Way" could be Daniel Pyne's kind of story. He first brought Mr. Pyne into the project in 1986 with an assignment to rewrite a script by Lem Dobbs (who shares the screenwriting credit with Mr. Pyne). "Dan has a wonderful way with dialogue, and one of the best ears I've ever encountered," Mr. Sackheim says of Mr. Pyne. "And he also knows it is the characters who really drive a movie."
Mr. Pyne spent portions of the next four years working through various rewrites as the project moved between different directors and different actors. The script finally settled with the director John Badham, who worked through several more rewrites with Mr. Pyne.
By the time filming was ready to begin, Mr. Pyne was absorbed by other projects and left the production. Mr. Badham brought in yet another team of writers. Still, it was Mr. Pyne who "nailed it," says Mr. Badham. "It was his script that we got Michael and James to commit to. Dan brought a particular kind of humor and wackiness and sort of an unexpected quality to it."
 Mr. Badham cites one scene, a particularly dramatic explosion in which Mr. Woods tries to explain why Mr. Fox will never in 100 lifetimes understand what it's like to be a cop; it dissolves from drama into comedy when a stunned Mr. Fox pulls out a tape recorder and says, "That was great . . . I'm serious, I can use that . . . Could you do it once more?"
 However, Mr. Pyne remains tentative about how much of "The Hard Way" as he wrote it survives in the final movie. "I was more interested in the relationships between the two characters and doing a spin on the buddy film," says Mr. Pyne. "Lem had a bigger comic plot, more complicated, more action, which is ironically what they've gone back to -- bigger, more physical comedy."
 Mr. Pyne can't remember a time in his life when he didn't want to be a writer. He grew up in Littleton, Colo., a green-grass suburb of Denver, where he worried about living a life that was too bland to provide the foundation for the fiction writer he wanted to become.
He credits writings by Larry McMurtry ("Terms of Endearment" and the Pulitzer Prize-winning "Lonesome Dove") with giving him a sense that he could do more.
"Growing up in Denver," Mr. Pyne says, "not even Denver, but a suburb, I was fearful that I had a point of view and a perspective that would limit me, because all of the books I was reading were coming from New York. Then Larry McMurtry came along and wrote these elegant novels that I could not only identify with, but that inspired me because they were so specific to what he knew and what he had experienced in Texas. It made me think that I could someday do something that had some deeper meaning."
Nevertheless, when Mr. Pyne went to Stanford University in 1973, he majored in economics, in part to assuage his father, a sculptor who had struggled and wanted Mr. Pyne to have a more practical career, and in part because he loved economics. "It was sort of a religion," he says.
Still, he always found himself drawn back to writing. He wedged creative writing courses in between his economics studies and worked on the college newspaper. For about six months, he wrote for The Menlo-Atherton Recorder, which Mr. Pyne describes as "a man-bites-dog" weekly in northern California. He did a brief stint as a copywriter at a small San Francisco advertising agency that did "political advertising in that kind of snobby San Francisco way."
In 1978, Mr. Pyne decided to move to Los Angeles to see if he could make enough money writing for film and television to support himself while he worked on his short stories. Success did not come easily. There were four lean years before "Miami Vice" when he lived in a cheap, two-room apartment near the beach with his two dogs, two cats, his wife and his typewriter. His short stories went unpublished; he took screenwriting courses at the University of California in Los Angeles, and his first marriage began to dissolve.
"It was tough," he says. "I thought about giving up. I thought about doing a lot of different things -- going back into advertising, going back into journalism, going to Washington, D.C., and working as an economist." It was his father, who had hoped for an economist, who helped him remain a writer. "He has always struggled as a sculptor," says Mr. Pyne. "He worked at home, so I was very familiar with what he had to go through. If anything, it helped. He gave me the ability to persevere."
Mr. Pyne has yet to see the finished version of "The Hard Way," choosing to wait until he can slip unnoticed into a neighborhood theater and see it with ordinary people and watch how they respond to the portions that are his. "A movie becomes a collaborative effort when you start working with a director," says Mr. Pyne. "Maybe this goes back to the fact that I like to write fiction. In a sense, the finished first-draft screenplay is my movie and my story. From that point on it becomes everyone else's. So I like to have that moment when it's all mine."

HEADLINE: Food Supplier Opens Warehouse Outlet

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: PEEKSKILL

 BODY:
BINGING in the 1980's has given way to belt-tightening in the 90's, and no one is more aware of the sharp contrasts between the decades than those in the food industry.
Restaurants, particularly the higher-priced ones, are struggling to survive and when the restaurant business is down, so is the business of those who supply restaurants. To keep profits from sagging, some suppliers have diversified. 
 When one purveyor of fine foods to restaurants, Poritzky's Meat Company and Food Service here, saw its sales drop 20 percent last year from $12 million in 1989, its president, Sander Poritzky, sought additional ways to generate income. Last June, he opened a warehouse outlet that is a cash-and-carry operation open to the public.
 
'A Business Strategist'
 Mr. Poritzky, 51 years old, who is known as Sandy, said adaptability has always been one of his company's strongest assets.
"My father, who started the business in 1925 as a kosher butcher shop,would be surprised to learn he was a business strategist," Mr. Poritzky said.
"But in current parlance, that's exactly what he was; he had the ability and the flexibility to shift the focus of his business to take advantage of changing conditions."
Before his father, Benjamin, came to the United States in 1923, he had been in the family's cattle business in Poland, Mr. Poritzky said.
"When he got here, he went to Peekskill, where his brother Sam had a butcher shop called the Eagle Market," Mr. Poritsky said. "A few years later, my Dad, who saw a need for it, opened Poritzky's Kosher Butcher Shop. He contracted with several of the small farmers who were around Peekskill then, who supplied him with cattle, calves and lambs.
 
Some Satellite Shops
 "Since kosher meat is only taken from the front quarter of the animal, he sold the hind quarters to other butchers. And when Jewish summer colonies, such as Pine Lake Park, began to spring up around Peekskill, my Dad saw another opportunity. He opened a couple of satellite kosher butcher shops to serve the summer people."
By 1946, the Poritzky business shifted gears again, Mr. Poritzky said. "That's when my Dad bought what had once been a blacksmith's shop for $4,500. He renovated it, and he went into the wholesale business. He started by delivering meat, then eggs, cheese and margarine, to customers like the Forest House -- which was then a top hotel in Mahopac -- and restaurants and schools in the area."
Mr. Poritzky grew up working in the family business, where his mother was the bookkeeper. His first job when he was 9 or 10, he said, was sweeping the floor and putting down the fresh sawdust in the butcher shop.
 
Truck Driver at 16
 "Even as a kid, I knew I'd always work in the company," he said. "When I was 16 and got my driver's license, I started making our deliveries before school and after school in our truck.
"Then I went off to Hobart College, but I left after two years to go into the business with my Dad. We had a very unusual relationship. When I was 19, he gave me complete authority to run the business, which included doing the hiring and firing."
In 1964, when the Poritzkys bought their first industrial freezer, they were able to add french fries to their list.
"Then we went into cooking oil," Mr. Poritzky said. "It was a logical merchandising step."
 
A Move Into Fish and Poultry
 And when, as one of the largest purveyors of fresh meat in the area, the family saw their business threatened by changing eating habits, they increased the amount of fish and poultry.
"This has always been an extremely competitive business and one that is subject to constant government inspection," Mr. Poritsky said.
"Under the Wholesome Meat Act, which applies to anyone in business who processes $33,000 worth of meat a year, a Federal inspector from the U.S. Department of Agriculture is here inspecting us daily, to make sure that we are operating under stringent sanitary conditions."
But he said that retail outlets for fresh meat are under county jurisdiction like the Westchester Department of Health, which makes inspections once or twice a year.
 
Bargains Represent Business
 As the recession deepens, Mr. Poritzky said he expected to find an increase in business from cost-conscious customers seeking premium foods at discounts.
"Economists have been saying that the retailer who offers the customer the greatest bargain will do well during a recession," he said.
"I've taken that advice literally. We send out a catalogue and with that and word-of-mouth referrals, we've already had a turnaround in business. Even during a recession, people have to eat; if they can feast for the same price, I'm betting they will do it. Our cash flow has already improved."
In the new 23,000-square-foot warehouse in the Charles Point Industrial Park in Peekskill, more than 1,500 food items are stocked. They include the same quality meats, poultry, hors d'oeuvres and specialty desserts served at the best area restaurants, Mr. Poritzky said.
"The finest dining establishments in Westchester and Fairfield County are customers of ours," he said. "They include Auberge Maxime's, the Arch, the Inn at Ridgefield and Stouffer Westchester Inn."
Warehouse customers include working women, small party-givers and good-sized caterers. Deliveries are made on orders of more than $300.
 
Popular Items
 Among some of the most popular food items, Mr. Poritzky said, are three-pound imported hams at $2.59 a pound, strip loins of beef shells, which come fully trimmed and boneless without the tail, averaging 12 pounds, custom cut into steaks or roasts at $3.98 a pound.
"That compares with retail market prices of $5.69 to $5.99 a pound," he said. "And premium Italian salami sells for $4.25 at our place compared to $7.99 a pound elsewhere."
One hundred handmade hors d'ouevres from Wilton Foods are priced at $23.95 and deluxe desserts from places like David Glass and Sweet Street Desserts are about half the price they sell for in specialty food shops, Mr. Poritsky said.
"David Glass's famous chocolate mousse cake sells for about $30 at Nieman Marcus," he said. "We sell it for $16."

HEADLINE: Small Banks Resist Trend On Profits

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
DURING the 1980's, when many commercial banks were reporting fantastic rates of return from real estate ventures, managers at New Haven Savings Bank considered getting into those areas, too. "But we have learned from the past that prosperity does not last forever," said New Haven's vice president, David R. Rice. "So even when it's most tempting, we do not participate."
As banks in the state were completing their accounting for 1990, Mr. Rice and others at his bank said they were glad that they did not succumb to the allure of quick and easy money. 
 While other banks are going out of business or posting record losses, New Haven Savings earned $7.5 million in 1990, becoming one of several banks around the state that bucked the trend and posted a profit. Typically, the profitable institutions are small savings banks in suburbs or small cities, like Union Savings in Danbury, American Savings in New Britain and Stafford Savings Bank in Stafford.
By contrast, Olde Windsor Bancorp, which operates New England Bank and Trust, had a profit of $120,000 for 1990, on assets of $200 million, with deposits up only 0.007 percent.
 
'Everything Has Changed'
 "You never thought anyone would be satisfied with that kind of growth and profits," said Olde Windsor's marketing director, Sophia B. Bernier. "But this year, everything has changed."
Ms. Bernier said the bank never got into the high-risk, high-yield investments that were popular in the 1980's, which included commercial real estate and brokered funds.
"That works both ways," she said. "You don't grow phenomenally in the good years, but we're protected in a year like we're having now."
The 149-year-old Willimantic Savings Institute posted a $1 million profit in 1990, up from $600,000 a year earlier, for the third best year on record, despite having taken over the failed Brooklyn Savings Bank.
"The rule in banking is, if a deal looks too good to be true, it probably is," said William R. Wilcox, the president of Willimantic Savings. "We followed basic banking principles. We know our market, and we didn't get involved in commercial real estate."
The Brooklyn Savings Bank did. Its participation in a condominium complex has been called the reason for its downfall.
 
'Just Too Risky'
 Mr. Wilcox said many banks ran into trouble when they financed cars on revolving credit lines for automobile dealers. When times are good and car sales are high, such deals can be lucrative; when times are bad and sales plummet, banks can lose huge sums.
"There were times we saw banks around us going into these things, and you have to say, 'It's something we should consider,' " Mr. Wilcox said. "And I guess we did consider it. But some of the deals the banks went into were just too risky."
Several Connecticut banks have announced preliminary results from 1990, and most will be announcing their final numbers over the next few weeks. The results are not expected to be good in most cases.
Dozens of Connecticut banks and thrift institutions converted to stock corporations in the 1980's as a way to raise money for investments. But investors demand higher returns than depositors, and many banks chased high-risk, high-yield investments. Banks also were competing with mutual funds and other investment vehicles that were providing high rates of return, further spurring the search for lucrative investments.
But as the 1980's ended, so did the rapid economic expansion of the Connecticut economy. Instead of the yield, banks started to realize the risk.
In the last two years, 10 Connecticut banks have been taken over by government agencies or declared insolvent, one of the highest failure rates in the Northeast. Among the failures was Connecticut Bank and Trust, once considered among the most secure banks in the state.
 
Happy With Any Profit
 Many of those that have not failed have had problems. Shawmut National Corporation, the parent company of Connecticut National Bank, reported large losses in 1989 and eliminated its stock dividend.
"In this environment, if a bank is still showing any profit, you're happy," said Dr. Lewis Mandell, a professor of finance at the University of Connecticut.
Tracey J. Stangle, a bank analyst in the Hartford office of First Albany Corporation, said many of the losses taken by banks in 1990 were paper losses, as banks shuffled massive amounts of capital into loan-loss reserves. Those loans might go bad, but if the economy improves, they might not, he said; and in any event, they are covered.
"Hopefully, the last quarter was the low-water mark for bank earnings in Connecticut," Mr. Stangle said. But if the economy continues to sour, he said, the turnaround might not occur.
"I think 1991 is going to be the worst year for banks since the Depression," said John C. Shortell, president of Dime Financial Corporation, the holding company that operates Dime Bank in Wallingford and the City Savings Bank of Meriden. "Even if the recession gets better in 1991, the commercial real estate market is probably not going to recover. The most you can hope for, as a bank, is to stabilize your loan losses."
 
Conservative Philosophy
 Dime Financial earned $4.4 million in 1990, down from $7.3 million a year earlier, Mr. Shortell said. He said 4.2 percent of the bank's loans went bad in 1990, compared with a regional average of 7.5 percent.
"We have our problem loans, and we're working night and day with some of them," he said. "But overall, we have a very conservative lending philosophy.
"We do most of our lending in New Haven County, for instance, while other banks were interested in loaning money anywhere in the state. And they might not have had as good a feel for the values in the areas where they were loaning money."
James P. Cronin, president of Dime Savings Bank in Norwich, which posted a record $905,762 profit for 1990, on assets of about $96 million, said his company never converted to a stock institution because it is so small.
"We are a community bank, and we've always had the philosophy that growth for growth's sake is not beneficial," Mr. Cronin said. "We didn't think we could serve our market any better as a $200 million bank than we can as a $100 million bank. We never expected to compete with the big regionals."
Mr. Cronin said the bank's core depositors come to Dime for service. "And they don't leave us because they can make a half-percent more interest somewhere else," he said, so there was no reason to scramble for deposits.
 
'$2 Million Is Chicken Feed'
 But Dr. Mandell said many of the banks posting profits for 1990 did so because they were too small to interest commercial real estate developers. A bank can only loan an amount equivalent to 1 percent of its assets to any single customer, so banks between $100 million and $200 million never got into that risky business.
"The fact is, $2 million is chicken feed to a developer, so they're not going to get involved with a bank that small," Dr. Mandell said. "Those smaller banks invested heavily in Treasury notes and municipal bonds, and in the good times, they were getting a terrible return. But those are very secure investments, and they look pretty good now."
But even New Haven Savings, a bank that is approaching $2 billion in size and could have participated in some of the commercial real estate projects of the last several years, is profitable. Mr. Rice said that is because the bank abstained from those risks. More than 70 percent of the bank's loan portfolio is in single- to four-family houses, he said, and it never formed a mutual holding company to issue stock and raise money for investing.
"It may sound very conservative and old fashioned, but that is the way we operate," Mr. Rice said.
Mr. Cronin of Dime Savings Bank in Norwich said: "When we were going into the 1980's, people told us we were an anachronism, that there was no place left for a community bank. But we're still here, and we're still profitable."

HEADLINE: Baja: Surfer's Log

BYLINE: By William Finnegan; William Finnegan, The author of "Dateline Soweto: Travels With Black South African Reporters" (Perennial/Harper & Row), is working on a book about drugs and poverty in the United States.

 BODY:
When I was a teenager, Baja California was, for my friends and me, a big, gritty frontier that ran south forever. We drove down from Los Angeles in unreliable vans, camped in scrubby pastures and on obscure desert beaches, ate $1 lobsters, and surfed. Surf spots were named for the kilometer posts on the highway, which showed the distance back to the border. The farther south one pushed, the more exciting things got. The first time I surfed K181, I was 14 years old and firmly convinced that we had reached the far edge of the known world.
There was always some place called "the tip," shimmering in the extreme distance, circa K5000. Old Baja hands described a tropical oasis, with coral reefs, great waves and a real town. Of course, the road to get there was a deathtrap. Our poor old vans would never survive it, and neither, most likely, would we. And so Cabo San Lucas remained, for me, a mythical destination, a place I figured I would never see. 
 Twenty years later, reduced to surfing Fire Island on summer weekends, I got a call from my homeboy, Bryan Di Salvatore. Bryan lives in Missoula, Mont., now. He said he wanted to go surfing. Cabo San Lucas was mentioned. We took several seconds to think it over, then agreed to meet at Los Angeles International and to let Aeromexico do the hard part.
 The thousand-mile flight took less time than crossing the border at Tijuana used to do. We flew over a lot of desert, then landed in slightly lusher desert -- so much for the tropical tip. It was midday, hot and dry. The peaks of the Sierra San Lazaro rose in the west. We rented a funky little car at the funky little airport (where we saw a disturbing number of surfboards, harbingers of crowded waves) and set off for the coast.
It was still 30 miles to Cabo San Lucas itself, but our research (that is, our flurry of phone calls to anyone we knew who knew lower Baja) had produced a surprise: it seemed that the best surf broke on the inland side of the peninsula. The Pacific side also got waves, of course, but south swells often slipped into the Gulf of California and the 50 southernmost miles of the Baja Gulf coast were nicely angled to meet them. We headed for the Gulf.
We passed goats and a scatter of dim shops and grotty garages and then a heavily-painted bus passed us, going at least 60, with Radio Mariachi blasting and the driver waving his hands in conversation with a passenger. "Cuidado [careful]," Bryan muttered, adding something funny and obscene. I sighed. This was the Mexico I remembered: dusty, dangerous, sweet, profane.
But at San Jose del Cabo, where we struck the coast, a Mexico I didn't remember materialized, in the form of a golf course, condominiums and a string of resort hotels. We were still 20 miles from the tip. We turned and headed north on a dirt road that crawled through a chain of jagged arroyos.
We were looking for a spot called Shipwrecks. Four fishermen playing cards in a palm-frond lean-to shrugged when we asked for directions. One pointed north. We pushed on, through land that grew rapidly emptier. I counted five kinds of cactus: organ pipe, cholla, prickly pear, fishhook, cordon. We caught only brief glimpses of the sea.
Bryan and I had spent several lifetimes doing this sort of thing together. We had scoured the boondocks of Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Bali, Java, Sumatra, looking for empty waves. We once drove straight across the center of Australia in a '65 Falcon station wagon, four surfboards and a jerrycan strapped to the roof.
This was different, though. Then we had months, years -- as long as the money held out (and then there were jobs: dishwashing, bartending). Now we had a week. And adult-type lives to get back to. We were, therefore, slightly frantic.
We never did find Shipwrecks that day. We ended up racing back to San Jose del Cabo, spotting some surfers in the water south of town, and joining them. This break, we were told, was called Costa Azul. There were too many surfers for the few waves that came through, but it was blissful to be in the ocean. We surfed till past sundown. The other people in the water -- all fellow gringos -- seemed to be an easygoing lot.
But then, staggering up the beach at dusk, we discovered a message painted in huge letters on a seawall: SOLAMENTE LOCALES. Locals only. We wondered who the locals might be, and whether any gringos qualified.
Blearily, we found a hotel, one of the string along the beach at San Jose del Cabo. In our room, which went for 100,000 pesos ($40) a night, the air conditioner roared. The surf roared louder, though, especially after midnight, when the tide began to rise.
At daybreak, we were back at Costa Azul. The wind was onshore, which was unfortunate, but the waves were chest-high. By the time we paddled in, we were both exhausted and sunburned. It seemed neither of us had managed to stay in shape for surfing simply by thinking about it a lot. In fact, three atrociously fit Mexicans had paddled rings around us all morning. One of them -- a startlingly good surfer -- had been poor company: charging around, grimly taking many times his share of waves. Obviously a top-dog local.
After rehydrating at a cantina on the hillside above Costa Azul, we headed for Cabo San Lucas. The highway curved south through rocky hills dotted with white stucco second homes, their shuttered windows staring blindly out to sea. Sometime in the 1970's, a paved highway running the length of Baja had been finished. Clearly, many Americans, including many owners of recreational vehicles (we passed several trailer courts), now found the trip manageable. Others -- such as the guests at the luxury resorts we spotted, tile roofs shining amid the irrigated greenery on private coves and headlands -- apparently flew in. We passed a number of hotels under construction -- the tourist industry was plainly the mainstay of the local economy.
The tip appeared: a high dark spine of rock curving out to sea, ending in a natural arch and a set of offshore spires. Nestled in the bay it formed was the town of Cabo San Lucas, which looked to be perfectly designed for what it once was: a hiding-place for English pirates preying on the Spanish fleet. These days, it's a tourist town. We turned off the highway into a sea of hotels, boutiques, dive shops, bars and charter-fishing storefronts. There was a yacht harbor, a cruise-ship dock, a supermarket and an Italian restaurant with a satellite dish and a sign advertising Monday Night Football.
We made our way toward the tip, passing an abandoned fish cannery and taking a steep road up to the Hotel Finisterra, a sprawling palace ingeniously built in a saddle just before the peninsula rears and takes its final plunge into the ocean. The Finisterra retains some of the glamour of the days before the highway, and before mass travel, when Cabo San Lucas was a Hollywood getaway. Sitting in the hotel's Whale Watcher's Bar, which is carved into the cliff and faces south across the empty Pacific, it was easy to imagine Hepburn and Tracy there, rounding off a day of marlin-fishing with martinis. Waves were thundering on the beach below the hotel. We decided to look again for Shipwrecks.
This time we pushed farther up the coast, through the rough arroyos past Punta Gorda. Suddenly, we found ourselves in a backwoods Baja that I had begun to think was extinct. Adobe ranchos huddled in the gullies, surrounded by traditional palo de arco fencing. Windmills on the mesas pumped water for plots of corn, lettuce and peppers. Two boys on a horse pulled over to let us pass -- one had a riata around his waist, the other a machete stuck in his belt. In a farmyard, a mother and daughter looked up from their work at a cheese press. Burros and cattle lurched off the road. There were canebreaks at the bottoms of the larger arroyos, and great pink boulders scattered on the beaches.
The wind was still onshore, but the swell was strong, and we eventually found a bay we figured was Shipwrecks. The surf was messy, but inviting. We paddled out and rode long, bumpy, head-high waves over a sweeping rock reef. Sitting on the bluff afterward, drinking strangely wonderful beers and watching big blue swells wrap around the point, we knew we had found an honest-to-God surf spot. With the right wind, tide and swell, Shipwrecks looked like it could really, as we say, pump. And it wasn't tucked up under some tourist resort.
That night, we drove into San Jose del Cabo for dinner. The town is a mile from the coast, on a low hill overlooking an irrigated valley. Less a tourist town than Cabo San Lucas, San Jose del Cabo's jacaranda-shaded streets are normally quiet. This, however, was Mexican Independence Day. The main street -- named after Jose Antonio Mijares, a local patriot killed by the United States Marines in 1847, when the Marines took San Jose del Cabo as part of the American effort to annex Baja California during the Mexican-American War -- was blocked to traffic and filled with food vendors and carnival booths. Fantastically costumed mariachi bands played in the plaza; excited children ran through the crowds. Although we could see lightning flashing in the Sierra San Lazaro, it was a balmy evening in town. Brian and I ate chilis rellenos and pitahaya, the sweet fruit of the organ pipe cactus. One or two drunken revelers eyed us thoughtfully, but then seemed to decide against avenging Jose Antonio Mijares tonight.
Setting off for Shipwrecks at sunrise, we were alarmed to find the first arroyo we crossed full of mud. We gunned it and slid through. But the next stream bed was wide and the going was worse. Taking it at speed, I fought the wheel, low sun in my eyes, then lost it at a curve, veering off the road and crashing to a halt halfway up a tree stump. Fifty yards ahead, we could see two vehicles hopelessly stuck. The storm in the mountains had sent flash floods down the arroyos. It would be many days before the road was passable again.
From one of the stuck cars, three mud-covered figures lurched towards us. They were young gringos -- college kids -- and very drunk. Swearing and spluttering, they helped lift our car off the stump, then watched bitterly as we slithered it back to high ground and headed back to town.
We decided to try another spot. Known as the Estuary, it was just north of our row of hotels. We parked at the end of the hotel road and made our way past a large lagoon to the beach. The lagoon's banks were a brilliant green, with palm groves and sugar cane leaning over the water. This much fresh water this close to the coast is unusual in Baja -- and the lagoon at San Jose del Cabo was, in fact, a mandatory stop for ships in mission times, when it was called Aguada Segura, "secure watering place." Morning-glory vines trailed over the dune dividing the lagoon from the sea. The surf, which was good-looking but breaking too close to the beach to ride, began to break farther out as we walked north. At precisely the point where the surf became ridable, half a dozen surfers were already out carving it up.
We surfed all morning. The waves were excellent -- head-high, hard-breaking -- and the crowd grew steadily. The overmuscled Mexican from the morning before at Costa Azul was out, his lip curled in a fixed smile-sneer, but virtually all the other 30-odd guys in the water were gringos. And virtually all of them seemed to be from southern California. It was much like surfing Zuma or Newport Beach: the hustling, the hassling, the arcane exchanges. I failed to emerge from the bowels of a short, sparkling beast of a wave, and when I surfaced, eyes and ears plugged with sand, an onlooker, paddling by, tried to console me by barking, "You musta had some bitchin' visions."
The wind came up, onshore. Bryan and I were, again, exhausted and sun-fried. We retreated to the hotel, where we dozed and read and dozed and agreed that it was time to try the Pacific coast.
Because the surf on the Pacific side was exposed to the prevailing winds, our plan was to get there early, before the wind came up. I wrecked this plan by locking the keys in the car in Cabo San Lucas, where we had stopped for supplies. By the time we found a locksmith in the back streets of town, got the car open and headed up the west coast, the wind was howling.
The Pacific side was wilder in every sense than the Gulf coast. There were no resorts, no golf courses, just cattle ranches, jackrabbits and the odd small settlement. The only other vehicles on the highway were trucks carrying empty soft-drink bottles. We were, as in days of old, looking for surf spots by kilometer posts -- except that here the posts counted northward progress. We left the highway and bumped through scrubland and irrigated orchards, looking in vain for surf, and very nearly got stuck on a sand road near a fishing camp. Some ferocious offroad driving kept us mobile, but our car was not the same afterward: coughing, knocking, complaining.
We refueled in Todos Santos, a handsome village where the wide dirt streets were lined with pine trees. But the gas station attendant knew nothing about a certain cove that we thought might be protected from the wind.
I finally paddled out at a huge lonely beach where the wind was blowing sideshore and the waves turned a tropical aquamarine as they broke. The conditions were marginal, at best, and the wisdom of Bryan's decision to stay on shore was instantly revealed. I was swept downcoast by a raging current. Bryan ran along the berm trying to keep me in sight but was quickly left behind. I was being carried toward an unpleasant-looking headland, where the surf was crashing spectacularly. I struggled to catch a wave, eventually succeeded, and rode it to shore. Bryan found me sitting on the sand, gasping for breath. He kindly said nothing.
We exchanged our injured car for a healthy one, and settled into a tame routine: surfing Costa Azul or the Estuary in the mornings and evenings, and otherwise staying out of the sun. The surf dropped. There was a hurricane at sea, we heard -- a chubasco, they call it in Baja -- and each night we listened for the roar of rising surf. "Won't happen," a young surfer from Santa Cruz, Calif., told us. "The chubasco's off the window." He meant that it was ill-positioned to send us waves.
I went into town and, in a big, dim shop, bought a bizarre clay bowl. The bowl formed the body of a long-tailed, pointy-eared ceramic dog with an ear of corn in his mouth. The shopowner said it was a tepexcuincle, a hairless, vegetarian, indigenous dog. The shopowner's daughter, a self-possessed child in a school uniform, disputed her father's spelling of the dog's name -- she favored "tepescuintle" -- but agreed that the animal had become very rare because of its popularity as the main course at traditional Mexican barbecues. She said the dogs survived only in Quintana Roo province, in the Yucatan. Her father said he had seen one on the highway near La Paz, the capital city of southern Baja. Father and daughter regarded one another silently. To break the tension, I bought a second tepexcuincle.
That evening, the waves at the Estuary were small but exceedingly sweet. The wind blew lightly offshore. The sun sank into the mountains and the sky turned yellow, then orange and, finally, a deep plum. The surf was breaking close to shore, and the steep dune loomed above us, with palm trees and cactus and then three figures on horseback etched black against the sky. The wave foam turned lavender, and the lights from the string of hotels down the coast began to glitter. Pelicans fished, and frigate birds -- Mexicans call them tijeras, "scissors," for their forked tails -- soared above the lagoon. It was a magical session, and the magic deepened as a full moon rose from the Gulf, spreading a silver veil over the dark, wind-brushed lines of the waves.
The crowd the next morning at Costa Azul was horrible. Two, three, four people were on every wave, snarling and threatening. The muscle-bound Mexican hotshot outdid himself, sprinting around with blood in his eye, stealing waves, savaging them. The pecking order suggested by the graffito, SOLAMENTE LOCALES -- which hung over the surf at Costa Azul like a billboard -- was being fiercely rearranged. I found myself wondering what I was doing here. The scene had all the charm of the subway at rush hour.
That afternoon, we drove down to the Hotel Palmilla, one of the gracious old joints south of San Jose del Cabo. I was thinking vaguely of possible future trips en famille. As we entered the Palmilla's lobby, Bryan suddenly looked at me meaningfully. He nodded toward the reception desk. There, among half a dozen other workers in immaculate white coats, was the terror of Costa Azul, Mexican surfing's answer to Genghis Khan, also in a white coat. He saw us looking toward the desk, and nodded deferentially. He did not seem to recognize us, for which I was grateful. We hurried through the lobby. My face was, for some reason, hot with embarrassment.
I flew back to the United States the next day. Bryan stayed on for a few more days, managing, he reported later, to ride some good waves between overcrowded sessions. On land, he hung out with some young dudes from Santa Cruz and made lists of their expressions, learning to call a powerful wave "burly" and a dubious person a "sketcher."
Bryan pronounced himself altogether satisfied with our week at the tip, and yet I notice that his current surf-trip plan is both more substantial and more obscure than our Baja jaunt. He and his wife have rented a house for two months on a dogleg bay in southern Ireland where the surf is said to pump. I plan to visit.

HEADLINE: NATIONAL NOTEBOOK: Solvang, Calif.;
Windmill Gets Observatory

BYLINE: By KATHLEEN SHARP

 BODY:
A $1.2 MILLION reproduction of a 16th-century Danish observatory tower is being built in Solvang, a former Danish settlement that is now a tourist attraction in central California.
The tower is going up within the Windmill Project, a retail complex that includes a 56-foot high reproduction of an old Danish windmill. The owner, Paul O. Hanberg, said that the tower, which will double the space in the main building, to 7,500 square feet, should be completed by April. 
 Solvang is a city of about 4,800 people about 160 miles north of Los Angeles and about 280 miles south of San Francisco at the southwestern end of the Santa Ynez Valley.
The valley, about 15 miles from the Santa Barbara County coastline, is known for its vineyards and wineries.
The Windmill Project borders the Old Mission Santa Ines, which was built by Catholic priests in 1804. The retail expansion is one of the more recent projects undertaken here in the last three years.
"We've added 45 shops in the last two and a half years through new construction or renovations," Mayor Ed Hayes said. There are about 370 shops, bakeries, cafes and other commercial outlets in this 2.2-square-mile town.
Since Solvang was incorporated as a city in 1985, sales-tax revenue, at 1 percent of sales, had grown 32 percent, to $844,100, by July 1990, the end of the last fiscal year. In the same period, revenue from bed taxes, which are collected at hotels and motels, grew about 18 percent, to $925,667.
Downtown Solvang has been Danish in both architecture and cultural heritage since it was founded in 1911 by a group of Danish educators who had migrated from the Midwest in search of warmer weather and fertile farmland for their friends and neighbors back home. The river valley proved ideal, as the name Solvang attests. In Danish it means "Sunny Fields."
The educators built Atterdag College on a hill north of town. Soon, Danish farmers migrated west, along with bakers, butchers, carpenters and artisans. They built Solvang in the image of their Danish homeland. By the 1940's, the downtown was filled with bingingsvaerk (half-timbered) walls, simulated and authentic thatched roofs, cobblestone walkways, gleaming copper roofs and old-fashioned gas lamps.
The three-year boom in commercial building, coupled with a national recession, is slowing commercial real-estate sales slightly, said Barbara Talmadge, president of the Santa Ynez Valley Board of Realtors. "There are more businesses for sale right now," she said, "but that reflects the lack of sales in some stores."

HEADLINE: Using Iraqi Reparations to Build the Peace

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Iraq has now agreed in principle to pay reparations. This presents an opportunity to rethink the modality and functions of reparations in building the peace. We should do so with the following goals:
(1) To avoid the negative and punitive aspects of the reparations process. Going through a long negotiation to set a figure and then collecting that amount in monetary form could be grueling, embittering, and in many ways self-defeating. 
 (2) To prevent Iraqi rearmament.
(3) To help Iraq recover from the damages of war, and to improve its standards of living and education.
(4) To help the region recover from the damages of war and to work toward higher standards and a more even distribution of wealth in the region, between individuals as well as between countries.
(5) To establish a principle of responsible use of the region's energy assets while preserving formal ownership in the nation-state framework.
These goals could be achieved as follows:
(1) Work toward the resumption of normal Iraqi oil operations, with all income going into a trust fund established by United Nations resolution, with representatives of the coalition acting as trustees, according to a trust agreement that would specify the criteria for uses of fund income.
(2) The trust agreement would provide that the greater part of the income be applied as quickly as possible to Iraq's nonmilitary needs, reconstruction and then development.
(3) The remainder would represent the reparations called for by the United Nations, but the goal would be to apply those funds to economic, social, ecological and educational restoration and development in the region. Oil-rich Arab states (including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) could be persuaded not only to leave the main part of their share of reparations in the fund but even to add to it, particularly if non-Arab members of the coalition do the same thing.
(4) Distribution of funds would follow criteria in the trust agreement, but implementation of development projects would rely as much as possible on regional initiative and skills.
(5) Some portion of the income entering the fund would be accumulated to form the basis of a permanent endowment, and some funds might be used as loans.
(6) The trust agreement would specify a mechanism of evolution of the fund that moved toward broadly based support and gradually increased Iraq's control of its revenues, including a voluntary fund contribution.

HEADLINE: Outdoors: City Dwellers Seek Refuge

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. LYONS

 BODY:
CITY dwellers who enjoy the outdoors and want fresh air and solitude in an area free of boom boxes, bikes, volleyball players, joggers, picnickers and even smokers, might well consider a trip to their nearest urban nature preserve. For New Yorkers, that hidden respite from social mayhem is the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, which straddles the Queens-Brooklyn line on the South Shore of Long Island.
More than 300 types of birds, 100 species of fish and a bevy of turtles, terrapins, rabbits, bats, frogs, snakes, salamanders and crabs inhabit the 9,155-acre refuge, which really is a broad wetland of open bays, salt marshes, brackish ponds and upland woods situated between the giant sandbar that is Long Island and the Atlantic Ocean. About 250 acres are criss-crossed with gravel-paved hiking trails and are open to the public, 80,000 of whom visit the refuge yearly. 
 To people like Charles and Joanna Gazzola of East Meadow, L.I., who have been revisiting the refuge 25 or so times a year for the last four years, it offers "a fantastic number of birds for us to observe and photograph."
"We've traveled all over the United States looking at bird sanctuaries and wildlife refuges, and this one is as good as they come," Gazzola said as the couple ambled along the hiking paths one day early this month.
The Gazzolas, as well as the Kevin Kellys of Queens and Alan Winters of Brooklyn, who were there that day, are among a growing band of urban Americans who are soaking in the solitude of wildlife preserves and bird sanctuaries throughout the country operated by Federal, state and local agencies.
Among the more popular Federal preserves are: the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, the Tinicum National Environmental Center outside of Philadelphia, the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge near Minneapolis, and the Bayou Sauvage Urban National Wildlife Refuge, a 23,000-acre facility that opened six months ago 10 miles from downtown New Orleans.
Such facilities operated by the National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service have seen a steady increase in visitors in the last several years.
John M. Morehead, associate director of the National Park Service, said the increase over the last year was caused by "a variety of things that add up to increased use of urban facilities," including a rise in gasoline prices, the economic recession and a drop in overseas travel.
Yet there is a long-term trend since attendance in the 423 preserves and sanctuaries operated by the states has risen more than 20 percent over the last decade, said Ney C. Landrum, executive director of the National Association of State Park Directors in Tallahassee, Fla.
The reason is renewed interest in the environment, according to Harry E. Hodgdon, executive director of the Wildlife Society, Bethesda, Md. "Over the last few years we've seen a resurgence of interest in the outdoors and people are going exploring in the wildlife refuges and bird sanctuaries a bit more that they used to," Hodgdon added.
And they're looking at different things these days, said Don Riepe, the chief ranger at the Jamaica Bay facility.
"We're a little different from the typical wildlife refuge because there is not much game here, so we've been trying to introduce specimens that people would enjoy," he said.
"Some people are getting bored with bird watching and are seeking something else to track," Riepe said. Trying to capitalize on this perceived trend, the park rangers at Jamaica Bay started building up the butterfly stock six years ago by providing such things as boxes where the insects could nest and reproduce and planting flowers and bushes they liked.
"Our 'butterfly gardens' now contain 30 separate specimens and some of our visitors say they are delighted," he said, adding "everyone likes looking at butterflies but you don't see them often in a city."
Jamaica Bay has also reintroduced varieties of chipmunks, snakes, turtles and frogs that had largely disappeared from the area over the last 50 years. Further, through a grid of underground pipes and valves, the water levels of the two main ponds can be raised or lowered depending on the time of year and the needs of the individual species of migratory birds.
When shore birds such as plovers and sandpipers arrive from the South, for example, the water levels may be lowered to create the type of mud flat that these wading birds are used to, Riepe explained. Herons, egrets and ibis also may benefit from lower water levels when foraging for food.
One visitor on a recent warm day was rewarded by sightings of more than two dozen species of birds, including five different kinds of geese and four species of duck, plus hawks, owls, swans, warblers and quail.
Watching a flight of 300 snow geese coming in for a landing on one of the ponds raises the spirits of even the most jaded urban dweller, a feeling that is not lost on those who work at the refuge.
On one recent Sunday, two park rangers were repairing an osprey nest that had been damaged by the wind, assisted by four volunteers, including Laura Giles of Manhattan.
Giles is associate director of nursing at Bellevue Hospital, where she oversees the nursing activities in its hectic emergency room.
"I've been coming here to work as a volunteer every Sunday for four years and I absolutely love it," she said. "It's a different world here, one that helps put me in a different frame of mind."

HEADLINE: Lower Oil Prices Thwart U.S. Energy Goal

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The next few months are beginning to look like a very difficult time to form a national policy for becoming less dependent on imported oil.
 The Persian Gulf war and the sharp rise in oil prices that followed its onset in August reminded everyone of the large and growing American reliance on imported oil. But the end of the war has brought a seemingly contrary signal: lower prices. 
 Indeed, the price of oil today -- about $19 a barrel -- is lower than it was when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. And many analysts think it will soon be lower than when the Iraqi President made his first hostile noises in the middle of July, when oil was in the high teens.
To instill the need to conserve despite the plummeting prices, the Government could issue edicts, like ordering Detroit to make cars that use less gasoline, or raise oil prices artificially by adding new taxes or import duties. But the National Energy Strategy released by the Bush Administration two weeks ago relies instead on removing constraints from production and largely counts on the marketplace to induce conservation.
Relying on the market to tell the country to use less is a tough path right now, say some analysts who would like to take stronger steps. "We have gone to war in the Middle East largely over oil," Jack Riggs, staff director of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said at a Washington seminar last week at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. "But the price of oil is expected to go down, and the public may very well tell us not to do anything controversial."
With the price of oil about where it was last Aug. 1, and even with the 5-cent-a-gallon increase in the Federal gasoline tax imposed in December, drivers are enjoying historic bargains.
"The price of gasoline in America has never been cheaper in real terms," Robert B. Horton, chairman of the British Petroleum Company, said in a speech in Washington last week at a meeting on oil and national security organized by the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
He stressed that the price of gasoline was too low now to support the refining of new, lower-polluting reformulated gasolines. "Beer costs about three times as much per gallon, is largely water, and certainly isn't the product of technical miracles," he said.
Nearly every other industrial country -- even Britain, an oil exporter -- puts stiff taxes on fuel. But raising taxes in the United States would be politically difficult, Mr. Horton said, even after years of seeking greater oil self-sufficiency and realizing the opposite. More than 60 percent of United States oil needs are for transportation, and nearly half the oil America uses is imported.
 
Tax Was Rejected
 Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said in an address to the same group that an energy tax in the National Energy Strategy had been considered and rejected.
"We know what the response of the American public will be, and it's not attractive," he said. "They really do believe the bill of rights gave them unleaded regular for $1.06 a gallon, and they better get it or, by God, they'll get the bums out of office."
Proposing a tax on Capitol Hill is useless, he said. "It simply won't get through. People want to get elected again."
Mr. Watkins had told Congress previously that a mandatory increase in fuel economy standards for cars, which the Administration opposes, would be of relatively little value because average mileage would rise anyway, as shoppers chose leaner cars as fuel prices increased. But in the years since the oil price collapse of 1986, the average fuel economy of new cars has declined, with buyers given little financial incentive to choose more efficient cars.
To be a useful signal to the market, any fuel-price increase would have to be large, many people think. Amory Lovins, the physicist and efficiency expert, pointed out that because of the expense of buying, insuring and maintaining a car, the cost of fuel is only one-quarter the cost of driving a mile. Meanwhile, mileage is now high enough -- about 20 miles a gallon for the average car on the road -- that the price signal is smaller yet.
The consensus in Washington, including among those who drafted the President's energy strategy, is that the price of gasoline and the signal it sends to consumers fail to incorporate what economists call "externalities," or costs to society. In the case of the Persian Gulf war, for example, the costs of deploying troops, of cleaning up pollution and of living without the use of polluted land or water are externalities that add to the ultimate cost of oil.
Peter D. Blair, the energy and materials program manager in the Office of Technology Assessment, a Congressional agency, said he had heard estimates of the externalities ranging from 0 to $382 a barrel, or up to $9 for each gallon of oil.
But he said there was no clear way to quantify in dollars the national security impact of dependence on oil imports. "That means the policy goal has to come from elsewhere," he said, suggesting that Congress might set a national security goal, like a ceiling on imports, and set a tax to achieve that.
Still, with the large amount of oil used in this country -- about 215 billion gallons a year -- the added costs of the gulf war will probably have little impact. If the deployment cost $60 billion -- assigning no value to the loss of life -- and could be said to have assured lower prices for five years, the extra cost over that period would add a little over 5 cents to a gallon of oil.
In fact, because contributions from the allied nations are expect to meet, or even exceed, the cost of the war, the conflict may add less, or nothing at all, to the United States' oil bill.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Attitude on Bonds Seems Bearish

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Some credit market analysts say the recent selloff in the bond market, which has pushed yields to the highest level since mid-January, seems to be a clear manifestation of bearish sentiment overcoming the continued signs of economic weakness that should be bullish for the fixed-income market.
But these analysts say that it will take weeks, and perhaps months, for market participants to sort out the import of recent events. 
 The development that all but shattered what had been a solid consensus in the bond market was one that market participants had fervently hoped for: a speedy, decisive allied victory in the Persian Gulf war.
 
New Worries
 But that has produced a host of worries about whether suddenly buoyant consumers will transform what had seemed likely to be a drawn-out recession into a quick V-shaped recovery. The stock market, which fixed-income investors apparently view as a more accurate forecaster of recovery than recession, is another worry.
So, too, is a recent surge in money growth, a development that may have been fostered by the Federal Reserve's concerted effort to lower short-term interest rates, and could presage a turnaround in the economy.
Finally, the end of the war is raising questions about how much money will be required from international capital markets to rebuild Kuwait, and ultimately, Iraq. Some analysts assert that those new sources of demand will put upward pressure on interest rates.
 
Economic Malaise
 These questions were raised at the end of February, a month that market participants assume was another poor one for the economy. Last week, the National Association of Purchasing Managers reported the nation's economy remained in a malaise in February. The association's index of economic activity showed February with the lowest reading in the last 12 months, except for January.
Signals of the economic consequences of peace will not be available until readings on the economy's performance in March begin to trickle out in April.
"In the short run, the numbers will reflect the catch-up effect of people doing things they have postponed since last fall," said Jerry L. Jordan, a senior vice president at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "But it will be midyear at the earliest before you have a convergence of opinion about what sort of shape the economy is really in."
 
Looking Beyond February
 Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, said, "There will be a tendency in the markets to look beyond reports about February, because those numbers reflected conditions that were in place before peace was achieved."
Nevertheless, some analysts said the currently available evidence strongly suggested that the market's worst fears would not be realized.
They say that consumer attitudes may well improve in coming months. But after adjusting for inflation, disposable personal income fell by 1.3 percent in the 12 months that ended in January, and nearly one million jobs have been lost since June. Victory in the Persian Gulf may be celebrated with beer and pretzels rather than champagne.
 
Weak Demand for Loans
 Moreover, the recent rebound in money growth has not yet been accompanied by increased bank lending, a development the Fed said it had hoped to see. But data for the first five weeks of the year showed that businesses and individuals were not eager to borrow.
"The availability or price for credit has not been the problem," Mr. Jordan said. "The problem has been on the demand side."
Through early February, business loans fell by $19.6 billion at an annual rate, according to data from Salomon Brothers, while loans to individuals fell by $8.6 billion. Meanwhile, real estate loans rose by $6.3 billion.
David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc., contends that the expense of rebuilding Kuwait, which has been preliminarily estimated at $100 billion or more, will push up world interest rates by 10 to 15 basis points over the next two years. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The increase will be even greater when Iraq, which is probably facing an even bigger reconstruction challenge, is again allowed access to world financial markets, Mr. Hale said.
 
Fears Overblown
 Nicholas Sargen, a director in bond market research at Salomon Brothers, said those fears were overblown.
"Over the long haul, there is no doubt that these countries are a new source of capital spending demand," he said. "But by the time we get around to actual outlays, my guess is the impact will be felt in 1992, not the current year. And to the extent there is spending this year, it will be dwarfed by the sharp cutback in capital spending that is occurring in most industrial countries, excluding Germany."
The driving force behind bond market rallies around the world in recent months, Mr. Sargen contends, has been a decline in capital spending from the high levels between 1987 and 1990.
Although many market participants may view it as irrelevant, the employment report for February, which is expected from the Labor Department on Friday, looks to be the single most important factor in the week ahead.
Most analysts are expecting the report to show an additional 150,000 non-farm payroll jobs were lost last month, a moderate drop in comparison with the 232,000 jobs lost in January.
An increase of that size would almost certainly push up the unemployment rate from its current level of 6.2 percent. But most economists said the report would have to be much worse to persuade the Fed to push short-term interest rates down again.
The Fed, which must be somewhat perplexed and troubled by the market's reaction to the end of the war, will probably want to wait awhile to see how the economy responds to its recent handiwork.

HEADLINE: In U.S. Technology, a Gap Between Arms and VCR's

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
From the opening salvos of Tomahawk cruise missiles to the final desert tank battles, the performance of high-technology weapons in the Persian Gulf war led to rejoicing over Yankee ingenuity and the quality of American technology.
So some people are asking why a nation that can produce such sophisticated weapons cannot make a compact disk player and is falling behind Japan in everything from cars to computer chips. As the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, asked in the Democrats' response to President Bush's State of the Union Message, "If we can make the best smart bomb, can't we make the best VCR?"
 
A Mixed Answer
 Many people, including Senator Mitchell, say the answer should be yes. In addition to weaponry, the United States remains supreme in such technologies as supercomputers, software and biotechnology. If the nation were to devote as much effort to making cars and televisions as it does to producing missiles, this camp says, it might be possible to be more competitive in those areas where it is lagging behind. 
 But many technology experts say the answer is not so simple. To begin with, they say, the weapons are not necessarily that sophisticated. Nor does the effort involved in making them translate automatically into success in commercial technology.
Indeed, the nation's efforts to make weapons may hurt its competitiveness in other areas. Some executives say that because of the Pentagon mentality of striving for sophisticated technology at any cost, military technology has become irrelevant to economic competitiveness. In selling computers, television sets or automobiles, low cost and the ability to get to market quickly are as important as whiz-bang features.
The Raytheon Corporation, for example, which built the Patriot anti-missile system that destroyed the Iraqi Scuds, has had a tough time in the consumer marketplace with its Caloric stoves and Speed Queen washing machines and dryers.
 
Future Debates
 The performance of the weapons in the Persian Gulf is likely to play a role in future debates about national priorities and how to restore competitiveness. In a number of interviews, technology executives, analysts and military systems experts agreed on these points:
*Most weapons used in the war, including the Patriot and the Tomahawk, were developed more than 10 years ago, using technology far less sophisticated than that found in today's garden-variety personal computers. In that sense, the triumph of American weaponry in the war is not so much a sign of the nation's present prowess as it is a reminder of past ability.
*While the Defense Department once pioneered in developing technology that later found commercial uses, the latest technology is now generally developed for nonmilitary applications; only later might it find its way into weapons.
*Because of its loss of competitiveness in commercial technology, the United States cannot make some of its own weapons without help from other nations. A small but growing number of components and technologies in American weapons come from foreign suppliers, in some cases because there are no longer any American producers.
Before the Persian Gulf war, a movement seemed to be building in the technology business and in Congress to redirect some Federal research and development spending away from purely military technology like the "Star Wars" anti-missile system and toward technologies with more civilian applications, like flat-panel monitors for use in television sets and computers. Whether the war will derail that movement is uncertain.
For all the excitement over American weaponry, it is still too early to assess precisely how well the high technology performed. For every video clip of a smart bomb gliding into an airshaft, it is not known how many bombs went astray. And military analysts point out that Iraq was not the most technologically sophisticated opponent.
 
Good, but Expensive
 Still, even if the technology functioned as well as its ardent supporters say, consider the cost and time involved in building those weapons. Some $9.5 billion, for instance, has been spent on the Tomahawk cruise missile since 1972. Given such costs and time, some say, the weapons should work well.
"We're all proud of the Patriot's performance, but it costs a million dollars every time you push the button," said Jacques S. Gansler, a former Pentagon procurement official and author of "Affording Defense."
The military business, with its own goals and complex procedures, has evolved into a culture distinct from commercial business. Companies that excel in one arena often cannot excel in the other.
Some executives and analysts go further, arguing that weapons development has actually hurt the nation's competitiveness by siphoning off research dollars and engineers that could have been developing commercial products. Where Americans developed spy satellites, Japan made video cameras and is reaping the revenues.
 
Research Called Unbalanced
 Just last month, for instance, executives from 11 large computer companies issued a report saying that too much Federal research and development money had been spent on the military and not enough on computers.
The report said that nearly 70 percent of Federal research and development money goes to the military, up from 50 percent a decade ago. Although the Federal Government spends more over all on research and development than most of the other industrial powers, its nonmilitary research and development spending is less than in the other nations, as measured by percentage of gross national product.
Military spending was once believed to contribute to the nation's overall technological ability. The fledgling American semiconductor industry got its start developing chips for the Minuteman missile in the 1960's and only later began selling to computer companies.
That is less likely to be the case now, in part, some people say, because military technology has increasingly emphasized exotic technology with few apparent commercial spinoffs, like semiconductor chips that can resist nuclear radiation.
 
Shift in Electronics
 In the case of electronics, on which "smart weapons" rely, the growing computer and consumer electronics industries have simply spurted ahead of the military as users of chips and as technology leaders. In the 60's, about 70 percent of chips went into military equipment; now only about 8 percent do. So chip companies aim their development efforts at satisfying computer companies, not the Pentagon.
Similarly, some composite materials used in weapons are "not nearly as advanced as what you could buy in a sporting goods store," said Michael Sekora, a former director of technology planning in the Pentagon.
Robert B. Costello, chief of Pentagon procurement in the Reagan Administration, said: "Defense is not a leader. In many cases it's not even a user of the latest technology."
Indeed, an increasing problem for the Pentagon is keeping its obsolete technology in operation. Because it takes 8 to 15 years to develop a weapon, the technology is often outdated by the time the weapon is ready.
One company, Lansdale Semiconductor of Tempe, Ariz., does nothing but manufacture computer chips for the Pentagon that have long since been discontinued by the original manufacturer. Some of these chips are in the Tomahawk and Patriot systems and in sensors on helicopters used in the gulf war, said Lansdale's president, Dale Lillard.
 
Advantages of Commercialism
 Unencumbered by the burdensome military procurement regulations, and spurred by competition, makers of commercial products often rush ahead. An example of this is devices that calculate latitude and longitude by receiving signals from the Pentagon's Navstar Global Positioning System satellites.
The Rockwell International Corporation, under a Pentagon contract, developed a portable receiver that weighs 17 pounds and can be carried in a backpack. But companies fiercely competing to sell receivers for use in pleasure boats offer units that weigh as little as three pounds and can be carried in one hand.
These units are not quite as rugged as the military versions and lack some features, like protection against jamming. But when the Defense Department found itself needing thousands of receivers in the Saudi desert, it had to turn to a commercial supplier to provide them quickly and cheaply.
Indeed, the Pentagon is buying more commercial products to save time and money. In a sense, therefore, the spinoffs are now going the other way: A healthy commercial industry is considered necessary for the military.
 
Foreign Technology Used
 One consequence of this is that the United States, lacking a consumer electronics business and behind in production of certain types of semiconductors, is becoming dependent on Japan and other nations for technology used in weapons.
Virtually all the optical glass used in reconnaissance satellites comes from Germany. Many gallium arsenide chips, used in radars and satellite receivers, come from Japan. A report released two weeks ago by the General Accounting Office said that five parts of the Abrams tank are made by foreign companies, including the optics in the gunner's sight and an ingredient in a seal.
The extent of foreign dependency is not known. Several reports suggest that current weapons contain a small percentage of foreign parts but that the next generation will have a larger percentage. Some people say there is no problem in relying on allies for military technology; others believe the best course is to be self-sufficient.
 
Research and Development
 Still, some Pentagon and industry officials have been arguing that the Pentagon should direct some research and development money to help American technology companies compete in commercial markets. Only if American companies are successful in commercial markets will they be able to produce supplies for the military, these people say.
If there is a lesson from the gulf war, some executives said, it is that the United States can accomplish what it sets its mind and money to do. If the nation determined that economic security was as important as military security, "we could catch up in the commercial arena as well," said William J. Spencer, chief executive of Sematech, a technology consortium in Austin, Tex., that is backed by the Pentagon and industry.
"Why can't we make a VCR when we can make a Patriot missile?" asked Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. His answer: "We really care about making Patriot missiles."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: Egypt;
Egypt's Leader Says Postwar Security Is Up to Arabs Alone

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 3

 BODY:
President Hosni Mubarak said today that only Arab nations should provide for security to preserve peace in the Persian Gulf region.
Although he did not specifically refer to troops from the United States and other Western nations who remain in the Gulf region, he said, "Arab security will only be Arab, and it will have all the protection needed for this part of the world." 
 Mr. Mubarak's remarks, in the first speech he has given since the war ended last Thursday, came just before Arab foreign ministers were to meet in Damascus to discuss the post-war situation in the Gulf.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d is also making a swing through the region later in the week, to explore peace and security arrangements.
 
Foreign Role Opposed
 This evening, Osama el-Baz, Mr. Mubarak's advisor, flatly ruled out any role for American troops in the region. Speaking during a public discussion with Frank Wisner, the United States Ambassador to Egypt, Mr. Baz said foreign involvement in any Gulf security force "is detrimental, distorting. It will be viewed an American attempt at hegemony."
Declaring that "a new dawn" has come to the Middle East, Mr. Mubarak urged the Arab nations to put aside their differences and help build a new regional order based on mutual security, economic competition and democratic reforms.
"A page has been turned and a new page begun," said Mr. Mubarak, who sent 35,000 Egyptian troops to join the coalition force that drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait. "The days of darkness have gone and a new dawn has risen before us," he said. "The horrible tragedy has ended. kuwait has been liberated."
During the nationally televised, hour-long speech before the Egyptian Parliament, Mr. Mubarak also spoke directly to the people of Iraq, reaffirming Egypt's "brotherhood" with them. But he drew sharp distinctions between the Iraqi people and President Saddam Hussein, whom he accused of ordering his army to commit suicide "while he was hiding in his bunker."
 
Iraqi Leader Mocked
 Recalling that President Hussein had threatened to employ powerful secret weapons and send allied soldiers home in coffins, Mr. Mubarak mocked the Iraqi President: "He could not even use a single airplane or defensive missile," Mr. Mubarak said.
Mr. Mubarak's strong, and at times optimistic language, underscored Egypt's determination to use the end of the Gulf war as an opportunity to encouarge accomodations among Arab states, and to press ever harder for a solution to the Palestinian situation.
"We don't want a division between Arab east and west. We don't want a continuation of campaigns fo bad feelings," he said. "We don't want the Arab nation to be two nations."
In his remarks today, Mr. Mubarak did not directly criticize Yasir Afrafat or the Palestine Liberation Organization, which backed Iraq during the war. But he argued that the Palestinian people have suffered in recent years because their cause "has been splintered into individual disputes and the trading of accusations."
Referring to Mr. Baker's visit to the region later this week, he urged that the agenda for the region also include discussions of the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights and southern Lebanon, as well as the Palestinian issue.

HEADLINE: CBS Joins NBC in Dropping Audience-Gauging System

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Following the lead of NBC, CBS said Friday that it would abandon an audience-measurement system that was extremely unpopular with advertisers.
"Everyone was against it from day one," said Bob Zach, a senior vice president and media director for the ad agency Chiat/Day/Mojo Inc. 
 He said the networks were forced to drop the measurement system, which statistically adjusted the size of the television audience, because of the weakness in the advertising market. "It is very tough to maintain arbitrary decisions in a marketplace that is soft," he said.
 
Awaiting a Move by ABC
 While ABC has not announced how it will proceed, television executives said they expected it to follow suit.
"Once one network said they were out of tat business, then for all practical purposes everybody is out," said Peter Lund, executive vice president of the CBS Broadcast group.
All three networks introduced the system last summer after the A. C. Nielsen Company reported a drop in overall television viewing.
For years, advertising rates have been based on Nielsen's viewing data. The adjustable audience-measurement system, based on a complex formula, took into account viewing patterns in earlier years.
But advertisers said the networks were inflating their audience levels through the new system. The advertisers were also unhappy when the networks said they would no longer guarantee a certain number of viewers for each program.
NBC estimated that the new system had cost the three networks up to $200 million in advertising that was lost to Fox Broadcasting and cable channels. But Mr. Lund of CBS said, "It is very hard to document any lost business."
It is not clear if the networks ever actually stopped giving advertisers additional commercial time if an audience's size fell below its guarantee. Mr. Lund said, "I am not sure if the implementation ever took place."
 
'They Have Never Enforced It'
 Mr. Zach of Chiat/Day/Mojo, said the networks had not altered their guarantee policies for his agency's clients, which include the American Express Company and the Nissan Motor Corporation. "They have never enforced it on our accounts," he said. "We are still getting guarantees."
Mr Zach said economic conditions had forced the networks to return to the old way of doing business. Each spring, the networks try to sign large advertisers up for yearlong contracts. A discounted price and the audience guarantee had been two important reasons for buying a year's worth of advertising time up front.
But with declines in network audiences driving down rates, advertisers were able to buy advertising time on short notice at a price below the discounted annual rate.

HEADLINE: Forest Hills Rape Arrest Eases Fears

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
Two officers, patrolling in a police car on a quiet residential street in Forest Hills on Friday night, arrested a man they thought fit the description of the person wanted in five sexual attacks and a robbery that had frightened people in the Queens neighborhood since last September.
In four of the assaults, the attacker cut his victims on their throats. On Friday night, under his coat, the officers said they found a 13-inch carving knife with an 8-inch blade. 
 Yesterday afternoon, as the police investigated whether the suspect was involved with sexual assaults in Brooklyn and the Bronx, Marilyn Reichstein was walking on 70th Avenue near Fleet Street in Forest Hills.
That was the exact spot where the police had arrested the suspect, Roy Hickman, a 25-year-old man who lived with his elderly mother and stepfather at 252 West 149th Street in Harlem.
 
'Quite Anxious'
 "I was aware of the rapes, and yes, there was great concern here," said Mrs. Reichstein, a graphic designer. "Everyone I spoke to was quite anxious and I told my daughter when she was coming home at night to take the bus from the station."
The station she referred to is the Continental Avenue-71st Avenue station, which is in Forest Hills Gardens, about six blocks from where Mrs. Reichstein stood yesterday. Most of the assaults occurred within 10 blocks of the station, which fronts a square paved with red bricks that resembles an old English town. The shady streets that run off it at different angles are lined with expensive brick and stone Tudor houses.
The commanding officer of Queens detectives, Deputy Chief John V. Menken, explained part of the suspect's method. "He would take a train from Manhattan into Forest Hills, get out and walk into the area and hide himself behind bushes or some other object," Chief Menken said. "When a victim came by, he would then grab them, put the knife to them and drag them back into a driveway or behind a garage, where he would sexually assault and then rob them."
In four incidents, he cut the victim, the chief said, and in one he used a stun gun.
 
Fit Description 'to a T'
 On Friday at 8:45 P.M., Officers Steven Haynes and Eric Crumbley of the 112th Precinct, who have been police officers for four years each, stopped Mr. Hickman because he fit the suspect's description "to a T," Chief Menken said at a news conference yesterday in the 112th Precinct station house. The description was: male black, 5-foot-7, 140 pounds, with a black three-quarter coat, a hood and a black knit hat.
As detectives from the Queens Sex Crimes Squad and Queens Homicide Task Force questioned Mr. Hickman into Saturday about the assaults from Sept. 16 through Feb. 26, other detectives searched his apartment, where they said they found a stun gun and another knife. They also found a credit card belonging to one of the victims, said Chief Menken. He said one victim identified Mr. Hickman in a lineup.
It was not until late Saturday night, shortly before Mr. Hickman was arraigned in court, that the police announced that they had a suspect. He was charged with two counts of first-degree rape, three counts of first-degree sexual abuse, six counts of first-degree robbery, four counts of felonious assault and six counts of fourth-degree possession of a deadly weapon.
 
A Former Street Peddler
 "I can say we're satisfied and quite confident that we have the individual in custody who committed these series of sexual assaults," Chief Menken said.
Mr. Hickman, who the police say had a minor arrest record for evading subway fares on two occasions, was described by his stepfather, Green Dasher, 77, a former clothes presser, as an unemployed former street peddler who had lived with his father until the father died of a stroke several years ago.
Mr. Hickman would stay around the apartment "for a week at a time," Mr. Dasher said.
"Sometimes he would go out at 6 and come back at 3 or 4 in the morning," Mr. Dasher said. "Nobody around here knows him. When he leaves here, he goes downtown -- at least that's what he says."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
The Fires of Patriotism And Cold Necessity Put 13 in Harm's Way

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times; The following article is based on reporting by Don Terry, Sam Howe Verhovek and Mary B. W. Tabor and was written by Mr. Terry.

DATELINE: GREENSBURG, Pa., March 3

 BODY:
Sorrow rushes over the hills and swoops into the valleys across western Pennsylvania like a bitter wind these days because soon the funerals will start.
Thirteen Army reservists from this close-knit region of small cities and farm towns in the foothills of the Alleghenies were killed last Monday in one of the final Scud attacks of the Persian Gulf war. 
 The loss has shaken and stunned this land of tough but friendly people who despite the rugged terrain that separates their communities are tied together by immigrant backgrounds, a love of high school sports and a faith in country as strong as the steel they produced before the mills began to close and the hard times set in.
Most of the reservists lived within a two-hour drive of the Greensburg Army Reserve Center, a low-slung brick building at the top of a winding road, where they gathered one weekend a month to train, listen to lectures and socialize.
 
 
 
Who They Were
 They were 11 men and 2 women. They were black and they were white. They were laborers and they were college students. "They were us," Gov. Robert Casey said in a memorial service here Saturday. "The roll reads like a list of the family next door."
They came from places called Latrobe and Monongahela and Monessen, where a quarter will buy five hours on the parking meters downtown.
"The towns are so close together around here that everyone knows someone from another town and everyone certainly feels this," said Jim Steeley, a teacher at a local high school. "I don't know of any geographic part of the country that was hit as hard as this immediate area was by the war."
President Bush agreed. "For the Greensburg community, I know the cost of freedom has been particulary high," he said in a letter that was read at the memorial service, which was attended by more than 1,000 people.
 
Kindness From Strangers
 Other services are planned or have already been held throughout the area. But not all the expressions of grief have come in the form of organized services.
In Monessen, where the parents of one of the reservists, Specialist Anthony Madison, live, an old man climbed the steep porch steps and knocked on the door. The man had tears in his eyes as he presented the family with a card and a $20 bill.
The old man was a stranger.
Counseling teams are being assembled to help family and friends deal with the grief. That will not be easy.
"We are still stunned by the suddenness of the tragedy," Governor Casey said at the memorial. "The shock is worse because we believed they were out of harm's way."
The 13 reservists were members of the 14th Quartermaster Detachment, a 69-member water purification unit housed in Saudi Arabia with several other reserve units miles from the front. They had arrived in Saudi Arabia only a few days before the attack and were staying in a barracks in Dhahran.
Their deaths, and the deaths of 15 other reservists living in the barracks, are the largest concentration of United States casualties in a war that killed 95 Americans. And the fact that they all died so far from the front during a ground war that had been expected to produce many front line casualties is one of the cruelest ironies of the conflict.
Patriotism was a major reason most of them had joined the Reserves. Many were the sons and daughters of soldiers and grew up waving flags on the Fourth of July and listening to war stories around the dinner table.
But they were also pushed through the recruitment office door by the need to earn money for college or to learn a new skill for a job market that threatened to leave them standing in front of a closed steel mill.
 
Ordinary and Extraordinary
 Reading the roll of the victims, Governor Casey called them "salt of the earth people, who were extraordinary Americans." People like Specialist Beverly S. Clark, 23 years old, of Armagh, a secretary and member of the Future Business Leaders of America; Specialist Steven E. Atherton, 26, a forklift operator who lived with his wife, Brenda, and 6-month-old son Aaron in Nu Mine, and dreamed of the day they could buy a house;
Specialist Frank S. Keough, 22, of North Huntingdon, who wanted to become a reading teacher and who joined the Reserves to earn money for college; Specialist Frank J. Walls, 20, of Hawthorn, a college student who like thousands of young people in a region that produced football greats like Joe Montana was a devoted athlete; Specialist John A. Boliver Jr. of Monongahela, who followed his grandfather and father into the military;
Sgt. Allan B. Craver, 32, of Penn Hills, who felt that the water purification mission was socially responsible work; Specialist Richard V. Wolverton, 24, who was born into a military family and settled in Latrobe 10 years ago; Stephen Siko, 24, of Lloydsville, a 1984 graduate of Greater Latrobe High School who was divorced and had a 5-year-old son named Stephen Jacob; Specialist Thomas G. Stone, 20, of Jamestown, N.Y., a star on his high school wrestling team and the father of a 17-month-old girl.
 
The Student
A Steady March Toward a Dream
Early in the morning of Memorial Day in 1987, Donald Reed sat on his porch swing in Hickory, Pa., when a pickup truck rumbled past and pulled up at the cemetery just down the road.
A young man in jeans got out and slowly walked amid the tombstones, a trumpet under his arm. Raising it, he played taps, so softly that Mr. Reed had to strain to hear the notes. Then he got in the truck and rumbled up the street in a cloud of dust.
The solitary figure was Joseph P. Bongiorni 3d, then a high school junior, more recently a specialist with the 14th Army Reserve Quartermaster Detachment.
A quiet, earnest boy who loved to play music and to hike and fish in the Allegheny Mountains here in Western Pennsylvania, Mr. Bongiorni had another passion in life: the military. "Ever since he was a little boy, Joey wanted to be a soldier," said his mother, Rita Bongiorni.
 
Promise to Parents
 That young Joey came to be in the Reserves was not of his own choice. He had wanted to join the Army full time right out of high school, but Mrs. Bongiorni and her husband, Joseph 2d, made him promise to go to college first. So at the age of 17, he enrolled at West Virginia University in Morgantown as a civil engineering major. The call for active duty came in January; within a month he was in the Middle East.
"He wanted to go," said Mr. Bongiorni's 24-year-old sister, Jody. "Joey was a little scared, like any normal person would be, but he wanted to go."
His eagerness was so great that he was a bit frustrated to learn that his main duties would be with a water purification unit in Saudi Arabia, far from the front lines.
"Hey Bro," he had written in a rambling letter to Timothy Gilbert, one of his best friends, just days before he left for the gulf. "Who wants to be a water boy, anyway?"
Mr. Bongiorni was an honor student who graduated from Fort Cherry High School in 1989. He played defensive end for the Fort Cherry Rangers football team and played trumpet in the school band. At half time, when the other members marched out in red uniforms, there was Mr. Bongiorni marching in his muddy jersey and shoulder pads.
The school's principal, Jess King, recalled that he "never gave less than 110 percent in everything he did." His music teacher, Dick Burns, said that Mr. Bongiorni "used to have a little trouble with the high notes," but would practice for hours at a time in the band room.
"I think he liked music for the same reason he liked the military," Mr. Burns said. "It was the discipline of the thing."
About 150 people turned out in a rattling wind on Thursday afternoon for a brief memorial service at the high school. At the family's request, the service concluded with Mr. Burns stepping to the school marquee and playing taps.
 
The Athlete
Talent Wasted In a Dying Town
When Specialist Anthony Madison was a boy growing up in Monessen, he dreamed of becoming a professional boxer. He hoped to dance and slug his way to the top and away from a life in the mills where his father had earned a decent living but had also lost a leg.
Specialist Madison was 9 years old when his father, Norman, took his son into the basement of the Taylor Funeral Home, where he worked part-time. There in the dimness, Mr. Madison, a former Marine Corps boxing champion, began teaching the skinny boy how to fight.
"He caught on real quick," Mr. Madison, 54, said last week. "But sometimes he got a little hard headed. He'd drop his hands and I'd have to pop him one. He thought he could box better than me. I said, 'Hey, I taught you what I know, but not all I know.' Those were some good times. Real good times." He fell silent as if the memory had stolen his voice.
A few minutes later the telephone rang in Mr. Madison's two-story house. It was Taylor's calling to discuss arrangements for his son's funeral.
Anthony Madison was born in Monessen 27 years ago and graduated from Monessen High School in 1983. A gifted athlete, he struggled in school, especially after his parents' divorce and then his mother's death in 1982. He spent a year in the job corps learning bricklaying, and loved playing music as a disk jockey around town.
Specialist Madison played on the football team at Monessen and dated the girl he later married, Leeann. They had two children, Dacarra, 3, and Anthony Jr., 5.
In this part of the country where football is both king and queen, Specialist Madison could have been a prince if he had stuck with the sport and his studies, said his former coach and counselor, Jack Scarvel. He played both defensive end and running back.
"He was an impact player," Mr. Scarvel said. "He was a wiry, hard-hitting football player. I asked one of the coaches about him once and he said, 'Tony is the kind of kid that you want in the foxhole with you.' He'd do anything you asked of him. He was quiet, loyal. He made this town proud."
 
Nothing Else But to Join
 Like countless other communities in this part of Pennsylvania, time has not been kind to Monessen or its young.
When Specialist Madison was a boy, jobs in the steel mills were almost as plentiful as apples in an orchard. But as he grew into manhood, the mills began to disappear and by the time he finished a three-year enlistment in the Army he could not find work.
Less than a year ago, he joined the Reserves. "There was nothing else for him to do," said his stepmother, Darla.
Shortly before shipping out to the desert, Specialist Madison pulled up a chair and tried to reassure his father.
"He said, 'Don't worry about me,' " Mr. Madison recalled. "He said, 'I know you will, but don't. I'm not going to be nowhere near the war. I'll be back.' "
 
The Sergeant
Faith in Army And Himself
John T. Boxler was one of the thousands of people in Western Pennsylvania who lost their jobs in the 1970's when the steel mills were closing because of competition overseas. But unlike many who gave up on the region and moved away, he hung on, looked for work and eventually found it with the Postal Service in Johnstown.
Such was the nature of Sergeant Boxler, a Vietnam veteran and Johnstown native who at 44 years was the oldest member of the 14th Detachment to die in the Scud attack.
Sergeant Boxler's family and friends described him as a gregarious man who had "a zest to pitch in," as one colleague said, whether he was in the kitchen, at the postal garage or at the Westmont Volunteer Fire Department in his neighborhood.
"He wasn't the most polished guy in the world, but he'd give you the shirt off his back," said his mother-in-law, Jane Crowley. "He must have given gallons and gallons of blood to the Red Cross. Every eight weeks, he'd go down there."
 
Town Is a Shadow of Itself
 Johnstown is a factory town, a place that literally grew up around steel and iron and coal. While perhaps most famous as the scene of the calamitous flood in 1889 that killed more than 2,000 people in the Conemaugh Valley, Johnstown has suffered quieter devastation in more recent times. There are 2,000 factory jobs left, barely one-tenth the number here during World War I.
Sergeant Boxler lost his job in 1977, when Bethlehem Steel "downsized." He struggled for a few years, but finally with the help of his experience as a helicopter mechanic in Vietnam he landed a job with the post office as a vehicle maintenance worker.
Although they both grew up in Johnstown, Elaine Boxler did not meet her future husband until the day he came home from Vietnam, in July 1970. She said he was proud to be in the Reserves, and when the call came to go to Saudi Arabia, he was "raring to go."
Because of Sergeant Boxler's military experience, the Boxlers were not unduly worried when he left. John Jr. told his mother, "Don't worry at all; Dad was in Vietnam and he knows how to take care of himself." Mrs. Boxler remembered thinking, "A water purification unit -- what could sound like a safer thing to be a part of."
At 6 A.M. Wednesday, an official car pulled up with two Army reservists to the Boxlers' tidy, two-story colonial house. One of the reservists could not stop himself from crying when he stood at the doorway and read a statement of condolence from the Army.
Now the Johnstown post office is draped with black bunting. But the Boxler home is still hung with American flags and bright yellow ribbons. That was one thing, Mrs. Boxler said with a sad smile as she walked a visitor through the house the other night -- it had not occurred to her to take the ribbons down.
 
The Shy One
Seeing the World And Growing Up
For Specialist Christine L. Mayes, military service marked a coming of age.
As a teen-ager in this Pennsylvania's coal country, Ms. Mayes spent long afternoons walking with friends down the lone street here, playing high school softball or picking corn for spending money. She was "a good girl, but a shy one," said neighbors and school friends. So shy that even in Rochester Mills, a rural community of 65 families where most everyone is related by blood or marriage, Ms. Mayes kept mostly to herself.
Until she joined the military. Like many other young people in this economically depressed region, Ms. Mayes saw the Army as a way to help pay for the college education that her father, a construction worker, could not afford. She enlisted right after graduating from Marion Center Area High School in 1986 and was shipped to Germany, where she served as a cook for three years.
When Specialist Mayes was discharged and arrived home last summer, the honey-colored curls of a girl who had once belonged to the Future Homemakers of America had given way to a bleached blond coiffure, triple-pierced ears and a penchant for rap music.
"I didn't even know what rap music was," said Linda Winebark, a childhood friend who said she did not recognize Specialist Mayes upon her return. "She went from T-shirts and blue jeans to skirts and heels," she said. "Chris had really grown up and become outgoing. It was like when she left here she was Christine. When she came back, she was Chris."
 
Getting Ready to Settle Down
 But the transition back to small-town living had been a good one, friends and neighbors said. In June 1990, Specialist Mayes began dating David Fairbanks, of nearby Punxsutawney, Pa., a drilling assistant whose father, Arnold, was an Army reservist.
That fall, Specialist Mayes, her younger sister Pamela and her father, Franklin, now unemployed, began courses at the Punxsutawney campus of Indiana University of Pennsylvania. In October, hoping to pull in some extra family income, Specialist Mayes joined the Reserves in Greensburg.
"She liked the service and she wanted to help Mom and Dad out," said Pamela, 19.
The weekend before she left for Saudi Arabia, Specialist Mayes, 22, and Mr. Fairbanks became engaged, but she did not take her ring with her for fear she would lose it.
The loss now, however, has been to Rochester Mills. Since last Wednesday, when news of her death came, visitors loaded with food and gifts have worn a mud path outside the modest one-story home, where a lone birch tied with tiny yellow ribbons stands sentinel.
Pamela Mayes said the family had received cards or calls from everyone in town. "We have even had calls from people on the answering machine who just say, 'God bless you,' and then hang up," she said.
Sandy Pardee, the Mayeses' next door neighbor, said community members were trying to build a memorial to Christine that would go in the village post office.
"I'm sure this is hard for the Mayeses in their grieving, but Chris is part of history now," said Mrs. Pardee, who offers $5 haircuts in her garage-turned-beauty shop. "This is kind of a tribute. If Chris could look out of the window, I know she would think it is such a gas that all of this could be going on in such a tiny little place like Rochester Mills."

HEADLINE: Defying Recession With Exports

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS

 BODY:
In an aging brown-brick factory here, hunched over tool-littered workbenches, men and women are coaxing tiny wires into circuit boards as they put together the computer controls that are the brains of machine tools.
Once finished, the Hurco Companies' control consoles and the assembled machine tools that cut, bend and mold metal parts are heading overseas. They are going to Germany, France, Britain, Singapore, South Korea and two dozen other countries -- part of the wave of American manufactured exports that has been a surprising source of strength amid the nation's economic recession. 
 The surge in exports of not just machine tools -- a building-block industry often seen as a barometer of a nation's industrial health -- but of everything from aircraft engines to power generators to nuts and bolts has helped make this recession very different from the one in 1981-82.
 
A Remarkable Resilience
 Last time, manufacturing companies and the industrial Midwest suffered most. Now, leaner, smarter and more competitive internationally, the manufacturing sector has shown a remarkable resilience.
Last year, American manufactured exports rose nearly 10 percent, to $316 billion, adding to a comeback that has seen such exports jump more than 80 percent since 1985, according to the Commerce Department. To be sure, the United States still runs a sizable, though declining, trade deficit. And slower economic growth abroad may cut into exports. Yet so far, shipments of manufactured goods overseas have held up.
The fall in the dollar's value, roughly 50 percent since 1985, has played a big part in selling American goods overseas, making them cheaper to foreign buyers. But beyond the change in the terms of trade, executives and analysts agree that the attitudes and competitiveness of many American companies have sharply improved.
As proof of the broad-based change, they point out that while a handful of big corporations, like Boeing and General Electric, have helped, most of the recent gains on America's export ledger have come from the numerous ranks of middle-sized companies, like Hurco, based here in Indianapolis. Such companies typically have annual sales of $50 million to less than $1 billion.
These companies, analysts say, have made big strides in improving the technological performance and the quality of their goods, straining to match efficient rivals in Japan, Germany and elsewhere. And by the thousands, executives from the industrial heartland have flown to places where the language, the food and the customs are strange, shedding traditional American parochialism in search of business.
"There's still a way to go, but we're beginning to do a lot of the right things in corporate America," said Kent Hughes, president of the Council on Competitiveness, a nonprofit research and policy organization in Washington.
 
Research Pays Off
 Hurco is a classic example of a midsized company that has clawed its way back from deep troubles to global competitiveness. It has improved its products and invested heavily in research and development, changes that have enabled the company to increase its share of the United States market and sharply expand sales abroad, cushioning Hurco somewhat from the cycles of American business.
Hurco sells machine tools to the "workhorse" end of the market, the small-batch manufacturing processes, for $40,000 to $150,000 apiece. Its customers include big companies like Boeing, General Motors and I.B.M., but Hurco's main market is the thousands of small subcontractors that supply larger companies with parts and components, and typically employ 50 people or fewer.
Hurco was a small but innovative builder of machine tools that ran into deep troubles in the 1980's when it tried to expand as the American manufacturing sector was being squeezed. It lost money for four straight years, through 1985, while debts mounted and quality-control problems proliferated, from oil leaks to bugs in computer software. To try to cope, management cut the work force of more than 600 people in 1984 to 360 by 1986, when Hurco returned to profitability.
Also in 1986, Brynwood Partners Ltd. bought much of its current 27 percent stake in Hurco. Brynwood, an investment firm based in Greenwich, Conn., has championed Hurco's spending programs as prudent bets on the future that will pay off for the shareholders, said Richard Niner, a general partner of Brynwood. In 1987, Brian McLaughlin, a young executive from the Ransberg Corporation, which makes factory automation equipment, was recruited as Hurco's president and chief executive.
 
Overseas Business Rebuilt
 Mr. McLaughlin set about building Hurco's fledgling global business, reducing debt, improving service and focusing research efforts on upgrading the technology of the company's greatest competitive strength -- computerized controls for machine tools.
To date, the strategy seems to be working in an industry littered with American casualties. Japanese companies like Fanuc, Mazak and Okuma have been the big winners in the American market, both by exporting and direct investment, despite a 1986 export restraint agreement with Tokyo.
Between 1987 and the fiscal year that ended last October, Hurco's revenues doubled and profits tripled, to $94 million and $6.9 million. The work force is back up to 530 employees, and more are being hired. Today, roughly half of Hurco's revenues come from sales in 28 foreign markets. Most of the company's overseas sales are in Europe, and about 20 percent of Hurco's revenues come in the highly competitive German machine tool market.
Like many internationally minded American companies, Hurco has moved beyond simple exports. The key component of its machine tools -- the computerized controls -- are all made in the United States. But most of the machines sold in Europe, for example, are assembled at its plant in High Wycombe, England, west of London. There, the controllers from the United States are put together with housings, fittings and screws from Germany, Spain, Taiwan or wherever they are produced most efficiently.
So exports alone represent less than half of Hurco's foreign sales, even though the company's exports are growing quickly and the components shipped from the United States are the heart of its machines. "Our computer control technology is what allows us to get orders," Mr. McLaughlin, 48 years old, said in a recent interview.
In Germany, the company bought out its Swiss partner in 1988 to establish Hurco G.m.b.H., and expand its sales and technical support staff in that market. The Germans expect service calls on machine tools to be made within 24 hours, a high standard that Hurco now provides to its American customers as well. Over all, more than 20 percent of the company's employees are now stationed abroad.
 
Shipping to Affiliates Overseas
 "We've found that exporting alone is too distant a relationship to really develop an international business," Mr. McLaughlin said.
Other American companies have learned the same lesson. Indeed, about a third of American manufactured exports to Europe are shipments by United States companies to their European affiliates, just as Hurco does, said Stephen Cooney, an international specialist at the National Association of Manufacturers, the Washington-based trade group.
Hurco's East Asian business, recently begun, is starting to take off with encouraging orders from South Korea, Singapore and Malaysia. The Commerce Department recently chose Hurco as one of several American companies to participate in a five-year program to crack the Japanese market, the Everest of the machine-tool industry.
"Hurco is selling good-quality basic machines all over the world," said Edward Miller, president of the National Center of Manufacturing Sciences, a research group in Ann Arbor, Mich. "If you can succeed in that part of the machine-tool market, you can compete anywhere."
Thanks to changes in product design and manufacturing, Hurco's cost for repairing machines on warranty is just 8 percent of the level in 1984. The training of machinists, which the company started as a "necessary evil" to sell machine tools, became so professional that it was set up as a separate business, generating revenues of $1 million a year.
Still, Hurco is not immune to the recession. The price discounting in the United States and Britain, which trimmed earnings last year, is expected to continue.
 
Tough Year Expected
 "Make no mistake, 1991 is going to be a tough year for us," Mr. McLaughlin said. "But this company is now in a position to be able to go ahead in this difficult period with a sizable investment program."
Hurco will spend more than $4 million this year on research and development, several times the industry average of seven-tenths of 1 percent of revenues. The company plans to move into a new $6 million, 175,000-square-foot plant in June, housing both production and administrative operations. That building, which will have an exercise room for employees, overlooks a lake with a running path. All Hurco employees are eligible for profit-sharing bonuses.
The research budget is going mainly toward developing specialized computer software for machine tools. Already, Hurco executives say they have an edge over their rivals in computer software, which gives the company two advantages: Its machines are easier to use, and the vital process of converting a customer's blueprint into a finished part is faster and often more accurate.
 
Speeding to Next Task
 The so-called print-to-part process takes about 24 minutes, compared with roughly 90 minutes on most competing machines, said Michael Seall, Hurco's vice president for marketing. In the flexible, small-batch production that is increasingly replacing mass production even at large companies, the speed with which machines can be set up for the next task is crucial to productivity.
To build on that advantage, Hurco engineers are working on further advances in software to offset the edge enjoyed by bigger foreign rivals in efficiently producing machine tools in volume.
"The hardware is becoming more and more a commodity," said David Platts, vice president for research and development. "The challenge for us is to bring state-of-the-art software and computing ability to the machine-tool industry. And it's the only way to get at the strategic problems of the American industry."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: United Nations;
U.N. Compromise Plan To Widen Relief to Iraq

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 3

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council pledged tonight to exempt more food and humanitarian aid from its trade embargo against Iraq and speed authorization for delivering the supplies to needy people there.
The decision, announced by Austria, this month's Council president, represented a compromise between the United States and its gulf war allies and a group of members who wanted trade sanctions lifted altogether on goods needed to preserve public health in Iraq. 
 The gulf allies say they are ready to send Iraq more humanitarian supplies to relieve suffering and stem the danger of epidemics resulting from polluted water and poor medical services. But they plan to do so on an exceptional basis without changing the Council's decision to ban all trade with Iraq except medicines.
The coalition partners say they are opposed to any formal weakening of the Security Council's economic embargo aganst Iraq at this stage because they are still pressing Baghdad to comply fully with their terms for a formal cease-fire.
 
Cease-Fire Resolution Approved
 Saturday night the Council approved a new resolution endorsing the conditions for a cease-fire and reaffirming the trade sanctions against Iraq as well as the allies' right to attack Iraq again if it does not make peace on their terms.
In a letter to the Council today, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said the Iraqi Government had accepted the resolution and "will fulfill its obligations under the said resolution."
He asked the Security Council to declare a formal cease-fire and to lift all sanctions against Baghdad.
As a result of the compromise tonight, five Council members, India, Cuba, Yemen, Ecuador and Zimbabwe, withdrew a resolution they had circulated that would have formally lifted the Security Council's trade embargo on food as well as on machinery and supplies used for purifying water and generating electricity.
 
Health Reports Prompt Appeal
 The five countries introduced this resolution after the World Health Organization and Unicef reported last week that Iraqi children are short of food and that hospitals and water treatment plants, operating without public electricity, desperately need portable generators and fuel.
The Council wants a special committee empowered to approve humanitarian exceptions to the embargo to speed up its work and take a more generous approach, allowing shipment of a wider range of supplies.
Today the committee examined the W.H.O.-Unicef report and asked for more details on what equipment Iraq needs to improve health standards. Diplomats said W.H.O. and Unicef will supply this information in the next few days when the committee is likely to give the green light for these supplies to be sent in.
 
Resolution Gets 11 Votes
 At today's meeting the committee also approved requests by the Danish and Belgian Red Cross to send in food for children. Last week it allowed Iran to send in some 700 tons of food.
The new resolution endorsing President Bush's cease-fire terms was supported by 11 of the Council's 15 members. Only Cuba voted against it while China, India and Yemen abstained.

HEADLINE: U.S. Balks at Easing Export Curbs

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
Fearful of the political and economic tension in the Soviet Union and arms proliferation in the third world, the Bush Administration has begun taking a harder line on how to restrict exports of technology with military applications.
The more cautious approach led to the postponement last week of a long-scheduled meeting in Paris in which the United States and 16 allies were to consider a drastic reduction in the number of technologies subject to export restrictions. 
 The meeting of the group, known as the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, was put off for 30 to 45 days, a significant sign that the Bush Administration is quietly slowing, and in some cases reversing, a relaxation process announced with fanfare last spring, as the cold war was abating.
 
At Odds With Allies
 That puts it at odds with many European allies who want the benefits of greater trade.
At the same time, the Administration is expected to publish soon in the Federal Register stiffer regulations against the spread of chemical and biological weapons.
This is a "difficult period in U.S.-Soviet relations," said Robert Zoellick, a State Department counselor, saying it required a "flexible approach" by the United States on all fronts.
Paul Freedenberg, the top export-control official during most of the Reagan Administration, said that what is occurring now is a "drawing back from the feeling that the cold war is over and that security concerns are finished." He added, 'It's all related to what happens in the U.S.S.R. and in the third world after Saddam Hussein."
The Administraton's caution is causing flutters among corporate executives, who had counted on broad decontrol of technology to all destinations to perk up revenues.
 
Concern Among Corporations
 "What makes business most nervous is the unilateral application of our controls," said William T. Archey, international vice president at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "History shows that other people don't necessarily follow our leadership, and so they get the sales that we don't make."
Cocom consists of the member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, except for Iceland, and Australia and Japan.
Under a plan worked out by the allies in June, controls would have been maintained in telecommunications, computers, software, lasers, turbines, navigation, avionics and propulsion systems and other "core" categories, but only at the most sophisticated end of the technology spectrum.
Then, with a core list in hand, there would be large reductions, as much as 25 percent, in the overall range of technology exports subject to export licenses.
 
Accord in Doubt
 The gulf between Washington and Europe is so wide that many analysts wonder whether Cocom will be able to reach agreement at its next meeting. Under the schedule announced in June, the allies were to agree on the core technologies by the end of last year.
The United States and Germany are especially at odds over telecommunications. The Germans want to decontrol such technology as high-transmission fiber-optic cables that carry more telephone traffic and the signaling switches used in large Western cities to route calls faster.
 
Far-Reaching Controls
 The new chemical, biological and nuclear weapons controls are described as unusually far reaching. For the first time, all exports of manufacturing, plant designs and processing equipment associated with the manufacture of weapons would require special licenses.
In trying to draft the regulations on chemicals, United States agencies are still fighting among themselves over which countries the rules would be directed at.
The State Department, worried about offending Syria and other nations, resists identifying countries as special targets. It would prefer to list regions like the Middle East where exports would be restricted.
To control chemical weapons, 20 nations have joined under the leadership of Australia.
Known as the Australia Group, they share intelligence on suspected chemical weapons development. While the State Department objects to identifying specific countries, the Australia Group has already singled out Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria as official targets for export controls.
Similar bodies -- the 12-nation Missile Technology Control Regime and the 14-nation Nuclear Suppliers Group -- have been formed in recent years to seek to control proliferation in those areas.

HEADLINE: California Readies for Political Brawl Over Both of Its Senate Seats in 1992

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., March 3

 BODY:
California politics is erupting into a full-scale, $70 million brawl with more than a dozen contenders maneuvering for two of the state's top political prizes: the United States Senate seats, which will both be open next year. Democrats and Republicans both have reason to hope for a sweep, making the election a potential bonanza as the parties push for dominance in the Senate.
State party conventions last weekend and this are the starting blocks for the 20-month campaign, when candidates must distingusih themselves in a crowded field. The next hurdle comes on June 30, when the first campaign finance reports are filed and the cast is likely to thin to those candidates, perhaps seven in all, who are capable of raising $4 million for a primary and $10 million for a general election, which is what experts believe those races will cost. 
 The last time there were two Senate seats open in a state at once was in 1978, in both Alabama and Minnesota.
The two Senate races in the same year, a first here, came about because of Pete Wilson's election as Governor in November, after the Republican former Senator's battle with Dianne Feinstein, and the decision of Senator Alan Cranston, a Democrat, not to seek re-election because of prostate cancer and the political damage he suffered from the savings and loan scandal.
Mr. Wilson appointed John Seymour to fill his Senate seat, which will be contested again in 1994. Now Mr. Seymour is seeking to be elected to the remainder of Mr. Wilson's term, but first faces a nettlesome primary challenge from Representative William E. Dannemeyer of Fullerton, who has built a career opposing homosexual rights. The primary, while costly, is thought by some analysts to be an opportunity for Mr. Seymour, a rather bland former state legislator, to establish his identity as a moderate in the mold of his benefactor, Mr. Wilson.
 
Running Twice in 2 Years
 Ms. Feinstein, a Democrat, announced that she would run against Mr. Seymour for this "short seat" in the hope of avoiding a bruising primary, despite the cost of running three statewide campaigns in four years. So far the strategy has been successful, although some analysts here suspect that Gray Davis, the Democratic state controller, may enter the race, which could comlicate Ms. Feinstein's plans.
The second seat, jokingly referred to as a multicar collision, involves five or six Democrats and a similar number of Republicans. While four Democrats have formally declared their candidacies, one who has not, Representative Mel Levine of Los Angeles, already stands out as the only Democrat seeking either of the Senate seats who supported President Bush on going to war against Iraq rather than continuing economic sanctions.
The Democrats who have announced for the six-year seat are Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr., the iconoclastic former Governor; Lieut. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy; Representative Robert T. Matsui of Sacramento and Representative Barbara Boxer of San Francisco.
Mr. Brown is considered the early favorite, because he is the best known and has a cadre of supporters, albeit dwindling in size, that could be enough to secure victory in a large field.
The races come in a Presidential year and coincide with contests for seven new Congressional seats to be created by reapportionment and will surely produce a cacaphony of high-priced political advertising in this vast state where campaigns consistently set national spending records.
"There are already reports of donor burnout," said Don Sipple, a Republican political consultant. Paul Maslin, a Democratic poll taker, agreed. "This may be a rich state," he said, "but it's not that rich."
The competition for money will be less intense for Republicans, who can ride the coattails of a President whose popularity has soared with the swift victory in the Persian Gulf. The National Republican Senatorial Committee says it is "unfortunate" that Mr. Seymour is being challenged in the primary, the sort of messy battle that is common among Democrats but that Republicans managed to avoid when Mr. Wilson ran for governor. But party officials say there is plenty of money to cover the cost.
The Democrats, however, will be scrambling for money.
While Ms. Feinstein struggled to raise nearly $20 million in her bid to be governor, eventually relying on a $3 million gift from her husband, an investment banker, she emerged from the race with a donor list of more than 60,000. She is also the best known candidate, familiar to 86 percent of the electorate, a recent California Poll found.
 
Well-Known Names
 Some other candidates also start out with the advantage of being well known and thus need less money. In that category are Mr. Brown, who resigned Saturday midway through a stormy tenure as state Democratic chairman; Mr. McCarthy, who lost a Senate race to Mr. Wilson in 1988, and Mr. Davis.
Mr. Brown hopes to pattern a grassroots campaign on the successful race for Governor by Lawton Chiles last year in Florida. Mr. Brown may be the favorite in the primary, but many analysts say he would be weakest Democrat in a general election if the Republicans chose a mainstream candidate, like Ed Zschau, a former Representative, or Representative Tom Campbell of Palo Alto, rather than someone from the far right wing of the party, like Representative Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove or Bruce Herschenson, a television personality.
"Jerry has the potential to be real destructive to the Democrats," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a politcal analyst at Claremont Graduate School.
The richest Democratic candidate, undeclared although actively raising money, is Mr. Levine, who relies for financial support on the powerful Los Angeles political organization run by Representatives Howard L. Berman and Henry A. Waxman. Mr. Davis also depends on the the Berman-Waxman organization and is thus considered likely to chose the other seat.
Mr. Levine stayed away from the state Democratic convention, which ended here today, thus avoiding taking heat from party liberals for his vote on the war, a vote that could reap a rich harvest from Jewish donors.
 
Asians Seen as a Factor
 Also in good shape financially is Representative Matsui of Sacramento, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and thus a beneficiary of contributions from those eager to influence Federal tax policy. He will also tap California's Asians, who now represent 10 percent of the state's population, double the proportion of a decade ago, and have yet to emerge as voting bloc, but have wealth to share with a Japanese-American candidate.
The candidate thought to be weakest on fund raising is Ms. Boxer. She has attracted attention lately, however, with high-visibility stands, like her authorship of a bill to prohibit sending two parents to the Persian Gulf.
"The most important thing is that Barbara is different," said Tony Coehlo, the former House Democratic whip. "She sparkles. Her eyes dance."
Republicans are already using the national euphoria about the war as a weapon, as Senator Seymour did at last weekend's Republican convention when he said the Democrats "would have cut our President off at the knees."
Still, Democrats are not giving up. "If the election were tomorrow, sure a Republican would win," said Ed McGovern, Ms. Boxer's campaign manager. "But it's not. It's 20 months from now. The economy may totally go into to the tank. Things are fluid and 20 months is a long time."

HEADLINE: U.S. Slump Hurts Japan Car Sales

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 3

 BODY:
The recession in the United States and an unusual burst of frugality among Japanese consumers -- is finally beginning to hurt Japan's largest car makers, forcing them to cut production and rethink plans for constant expansion in North America.
While the Japanese are selling fewer cars, just about everybody in the industry agrees that they are likely to emerge from the recession with a significantly larger share of the American market, at Detroit's expense. Yet for political reasons, Japan's big automobile makers have been portraying the slump as more dire than it may be. 
 "There is a strong feeling among the leaders of the industry that we have to be seen to be suffering as much as General Motors or Ford or Chrysler," one senior executive of the Nissan Motor Company, Japan's second-largest car company, after Toyota, said recently.
 
Honda Sales Down 22%
 Without question, the manufacturers that seemed invincible are hurting. The Honda Motor Company's sales in the United States are down by 22 percent, and the executives who talked last year about ways to expand the company's huge manufacturing operations in Ohio are scrambling for ways to keep all of their American workers employed.
The Toyota Motor Corporation, which two months ago waved aside most concerns about an approaching downturn, has now revised its predictions for the fiscal year that will end on June 30, saying profits could drop by 18 percent from a year earlier. The decline would be Toyota's first in four years.
In January, sales of Japanese models in the United States were down by about 10 percent, a big decline but less than half that of the American auto makers. More surprising, perhaps, is that in Japan, where the automobile market has been booming for four years, new-car sales have declined by about 2 percent in recent months. But those drops are based on a comparison with a record level of Japanese sales -- a level so high that most Japanese makers could not fill demand a year earlier.
"The companies will tell you that they are hurting, and by their measures they are," said Kenny Hyman, the automobile analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. in Tokyo. "But the fact is that most factories here are still running at full capacity."
But many people here are beginning to question openly whether that will remain true in the next two months, especially if Japan's stock market remains stagnant.
If the downturn in Japan is manageable, the decline in the United States is fraught with political problems. This is the first severe recession since Toyota, Nissan, Honda and the Mazda Motor Corporation each built large assembly operations on American soil. Last year, they built 1.3 million cars in the United States, and Japanese autos now command more than 30 percent of the market, if Japanese-engineered cars sold under American badges are included.
While each car maker says it does not want to gain ground at Detroit's expense, that appears to be what is happening. Even if overall sales are down, executives here say, a rise in Japan's market share during a recession could cause a backlash in Congress.
 
Honda Is Most Affected
 At the same time, so could a bigger downturn. One selling point of Japanese factories in the United States has been Japan's postwar practice of lifetime employment, even in difficult times, though no one knows how well the practice will extend to operations in the United States.
Indeed, the prospect of steady employment has helped Japanese companies to keep unions out of most plants. Should the downturn worsen, no Japanese maker will want to be the first to lay off American workers.
The most severe troubles so far appear to be afflicting Honda, long the Japanese champion of the American market. Its sales in the United States were down by 22 percent in recent months, to 45,375 vehicles, about half of them produced in the United States. The other half are imported from Japan.
Honda said last month that over the next three months, it would cut production by about 20,000 vehicles, including 5,000 a month in the United States.
"For Honda, it is a quite serious reduction, and we had to make a quick judgment to keep things from getting worse," said Shin Tanaka, a spokesman. "What is happening is that every market is declining." On Feb. 22, Honda announced results for its fiscal third quarter, showing a 50 percent decline in operating profits.
Analysts note that Honda is particularly hard hit because it has a much weaker base in Japan, where it is still, remarkably, considered a newcomer. When Honda's production cutback figures were announced, some Japanese newspapers scoffed, noting that cuts of that size often occur unannounced in Japanese auto factories.
But Japan's other big car makers felt obliged to match Honda's announcement, telling reporters that they did not want to appear to be pushing forward in the United States while American car makers were in retreat.
Then Toyota executives quickly said the company would reduce exports to the United States by 10,000 vehicles over two months. That is a tiny fraction of the 325,000 cars Toyota produces every month, and the figure is even smaller because Toyota said it would divert some American-bound cars to other destinations, particularly to Southeast Asia.
Nissan reported much the same when its president, Yutaka Kume, said it would cut back exports to the United States by 4,000 to 5,000 vehicles. Many of the cars will be diverted to Europe.

HEADLINE: Vermont Development Laws May Have Saved Its Banks

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Vermont is the only New England state that has not had a bank failure in the current economic downturn, and its strict environmental laws -- not shrewd Yankee banking -- are widely credited with saving the state from the worst excesses of the Northeast's real estate boom.
"There are still problems here, but nowhere like those in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts," said Thomas Menson, a former chief operating officer of the Bank of Vermont. Mr. Menson also spent the last five years as the top banking and financial adviser to Madeleine M. Kunin, who recently stepped down as Governor. 
 The environmental laws, known as Act 250, required such a long review process that they discouraged poorly capitalized developers. Mr. Menson said the act "weeded out the poorer projects, and you only get well-capitalized developers," and added, "You don't get someone who made a profit on one house suddenly trying to put in a whole development."
The sharpest contrast, bank analysts say, is to the situation in New Hampshire, which has long been the New England state with the most laissez-faire attitude toward development.
"I think all five of the largest banks in New Hampshire will require Federal assistance unless the economy turns around," said Gerard Cassidy, who follows New England banks in the Portland, Me., office of the Tucker, Anthony brokerage firm.
Act 250, enacted 21 years ago, has some of the nation's toughest and most time-consuming environmental rules and procedures. It applies to all commercial and public developments as well as residential projects of 10 units or more. Projects are reviewed by regional boards that consider 10 criteria: conformance to local plans, water use, sewage disposal, energy efficiency, soil erosion, effect on traffic and municipal services, preservation of wildlife habitats, historic sites, agricultural soil and esthetics.
The reviews serve as an umbrella for other state and local permits. Vermont also has a stiff capital gains tax on short-term land speculation that has helped to slow development.
Fewer than 2 percent of the projects presented to the Act 250 regional review boards are ultimately denied permits, but many are modified. For major developments, getting through the entire local and state review process can take several years and several million dollars. This comparatively strict regulatory climate has occasionally crimped profits at Vermont banks, said William Bruette Jr., the chief executive of the Chittenden Bank from 1984 until last year, when he moved to New Jersey to head Paine Webber Inc.'s national banking operations.
 
Cash-Flow Problems
 "Some projects that would have been economically viable got halted in their later phases, putting the developers into cash-flow problems that they wouldn't have had if they had been allowed to go forward," Mr. Bruette said.
But Mr. Bruette is one of many bankers who are convinced that Vermont benefited, on balance, from the regulations. Not only were fewer buildings constructed but those that came on the market ended up being more marketable because they were more environmentally attractive.
"A good loan depends on many of the criteria in Act 250," said John Ewing, president of the Bank of Vermont in Burlington. "There are plenty of cases where developments fail for lack of a good infrastructure, including things that banks don't normally take into account." Mr. Ewing is also a former chairman of the regional board that reviewed Act 250 applications in Chittenden County, which includes Burlington and is the state's most urbanized county.
Of course, Vermont's banks have not escaped New England's downturn unscathed. All of the state's leading banks have recently reported sharp declines in profits and have set aside more money to cover bad loans. Banknorth Group Inc., the largest commercial bank, last month suspended its quarterly dividend. And the Chittenden Bank, the state's largest until Banknorth was formed in a 1989 merger, reported a $1.5 million loss for 1990.
But over all, the Vermont banks remain strong by most historical measures, like the ratio of capital assets to loans or the percentage of loans that cause problems.
New Hampshire bankers doubt, however, that differences in environmental regulations have anything to do with their situation's being more precarious. They contend that the biggest factor is that New Hampshire -- and southern Maine -- are so close to Boston that they have been swamped by growth stemming from the rapid expansion of the high-technology and military contracting businesses in eastern Massachusetts.
 
Close to 'Ground Zero'
 When the Massachusetts economy crashed, New Hampshire inevitably crashed with it, they said. Vermont was too far from "ground zero," as the bankers now call Boston, to feel the brunt of the boom or the bust.
"I think market forces created our situation," said Marcel Veilleux, director of the New Hampshire Bankers Association in Concord. "I don't think stricter permitting would have slowed us enough for us to be in as good shape as Vermont."
Some Vermont developers also doubt that Act 250 has had much effect on the financial health of banks. "It certainly limits overbuilding, but not necessarily by weeding out the worst projects," said Peter Judge, owner of Judge Construction in Burlington. "It's basically a political process that has supplanted zoning."
Edwin Granai, a State Senator and real estate developer, has introduced legislation to "streamline" Act 250. One provision would exempt government-mandated projects, like new sewer systems and prisons, from review under the act. Others are intended to cut the number of occasions when developers must re-argue issues like traffic impact before state, regional and local agencies with overlapping concerns.
"I hear constant horror stories about delays and cost increments in projects that aren't bad," Mr. Granai said. "There are some desirable businesses that go right by Vermont, which hurts in tough economic times like these."

HEADLINE: Foes of Trump Compromise On His 'City'

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Donald J. Trump has agreed to shrink his long-stalled plans for a huge development on the Upper West Side nearly in half and to give New York City land to reroute the West Side Highway to allow for a waterfront park -- if the Dinkins administration backs the compromise Mr. Trump reached with civic groups that had fought the project.
The agreement would break a logjam on Trump City, one of the most criticized real-estate proposals in the city, at a time when both the city and the developer, who has had recent financial setbacks, could use the economic benefits it would provide. In turn, the agreement would give civic groups the open space they have fought for, would allow for the rerouting of the West Side Highway to make way for the park and would leave Mr. Trump's plan for a 150-story tower no more than a dream abandoned. 
 Under the tentative compromise, Mr. Trump would reduce his project from 14.5 million square feet, including a huge shopping mall, to 8.3 million square feet, 6.2 million of it residential, with 1.8 million square feet of motion picture and television studios and the rest office space.
 
Announcement Expected Soon
 No representative for any of the parties would say yesterday that they had a final agreement, but they made it clear they expected to announce one soon. Participants in the negotiations on the project said Mr. Trump wanted public assurances from the Dinkins administration that it would support his scaled-down plan and not seek further compromises.
And the civic groups, participants say, want a strong commitment from the city that it intends to build a new highway eventually, farther inland at ground level, and tear down the existing elevated stretch of the road along the Hudson River from 59th to 72d Streets.
But the big catch is that the existing road is so badly deteriorated that officials say it might have to be closed at any time, sending 90,000 vehicles a day onto surface streets in Manhattan. The state and city intend to award a $62 million contract, perhaps today, to reconstruct it, using mostly Federal highway funds, rather than try to shore up the highway for the several years that would be needed before the inland road could be built.
Late yesterday, participants in the talks said they were still negotiating just what language the city would use to convince the civic groups that it would be willing to tear down the rebuilt highway, which could last 50 years. But in doing so, the city risks jeopardizing the Federal money it would need for either project.
Barbara J. Fife, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development, speaking for Mayor David N. Dinkins, said yesterday: "The city is aware of the agreement, and we have encouraged that agreement. We are looking forward to making a statement in the next few days. We're pleased that there's a possibility that an important development can go forward without the contention that so often accompanies these projects."
Mr. Trump, in a telephone interview from Atlantic City, said: "I'm delighted that the community, the state and city and civic groups could come together in support of something. Not only will the job be a great job, but the cooperation means the process can work."
 
Civic Agreement Tied to City's
 Richard A. Kahan, an unpaid adviser to six civic groups, including the Municipal Art Society and the Parks Council, that had opposed Mr. Trump's original plan and offered an alternative that set the framework for a compromise, declined to comment on the negotiations last night. But others said the civic groups' agreement with the developer was contingent on the city's agreement.
Even if the Dinkins administration backed the plan, whose original version was first proposed in 1984, there is no guarantee that the revised project would be built as proposed. Mr. Trump would have to resubmit his application for a zoning change and undergo a long review by the City Planning Commission and City Council.
Negotiations on a compromise, which began in late December, intensified in the last few days, participants said, as the state approached a deadline of today for awarding a contract to rebuild the elevated highway. Also last week, the civic groups' suit seeking a restraining order to delay the contract was dismissed.
The groups have long wanted the road shored up temporarily, then rebuilt at ground level and moved east to allow easy access to a waterfront park.
 
Trump Owns Land Under Road
 But Mr. Trump and the city had contended that that idea was too costly and impractical, and the developer's original plan placed buildings where an inland road might go. The city does not own the land under the existing highway, or along the proposed alternative route; Mr. Trump owns both, and the city said it could not afford to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to buy the right of way. Mr. Trump's willingness to give the city the land would remove that hurdle.
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, whose support could be critical for any Trump City plan and who opposed the old one, said the compromise was the first step in a long approval.
"As long as everyone keeps that in mind," Ms. Messinger added, "we are on the verge of moving away from an appallingly bad plan toward a concept for this site that makes a great deal of sense for everybody."
Mr. Trump, who has had several serious financial setbacks in the last year, acknowledged that the city's economic slump made it an opportune time for him to seek a compromise that would allow his plan to go forward. Obtaining new zoning for the site would make it possible for him to build on it himself or make it more attractive to a buyer. He said he intended to develop some buildings himself and sell other parcels to other developers.
The precise configuration and number of buildings allowed in the compromise is yet to be determined. Some would be 35 to 40 stories, instead of the far larger towers orginally proposed for a Trump City, including a plan for the world's tallest.
One participant in the talks who was not on Mr. Trump's negotiating team said, "I believe he is now down as low as he can go without jeopardizing the economic viability of it."
Under the compromise with the civic groups, Mr. Trump would no longer be required to make improvements in neighborhood subway stations that had been part of his original proposal. Nor would he have to maintain the riverfront park after it was built. The city would do that. And Mr. Trump would not have to finish the park until the highway was moved inland and his project was producing income.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: National Mood;
War Heals Wounds at Home, but Not All

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
On the battlefield and at home, it was a victory of stunning decisiveness, like a thunderbolt that had the potential to obliterate the two decades of doubt and drift that began with Vietnam.
But with the fighting over, the real lessons and the long-term impact of the Persian Gulf war -- what it says about Vietnam and about the nation itself -- are far less certain than the surge of exhilaration now surrounding it. 
 For the short term, the war has had a profound impact on the nation's psyche and political landscape. To some, it culminated a struggle in which the cultural and political ideology of the Ronald Reagan era routed its liberal critics as decisively as the Allied forces routed Iraq's Republican Guard.
 
'End of the Decline'
 "This is the end of the decline," said Michael Novak, director of social and political studies for the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "This is the decline of the declinists. The mother of all battles turned into the daughter of disasters for the declinists. For years, people are going to cite the lessons of the Persian Gulf."
In a radio address Saturday praising the American troops, President Bush said, "The specter of Vietnam has been buried forever in the desert sands of the Arabian Peninsula."
But amid such euphoria, there were warnings that a military victory, no matter how overwhelming, against a country with an economic output the size of Kentucky's and a population less than a third of Vietnam's does not necessarily herald a new day.
 
Signs of Intolerance
 There were some suggestions that the combination of jubilation over the war and some signs of intolerance for dissent at home said as much about the frustrations and divisions that preceded the war as the sense of power and unity that came out of it.
"People in this country have been feeling profoundly demoralized and ovewhelmed and if somebody presents something to them in a way that suggests this is managable, we can do it, we can do it quick, it's a boost," said June Jordan, a poet and professor of African-American studies at the University of California at Berkeley. "I suggest to you it's a hit the same way that crack is, and it doesn't last long,"
H. Ross Perot, the billionaire Texas electronics entrepreneur and investor, said it would be tragic if the nation's pride in the success overseas diverted it from the enormous problems at home.
"Let's put a turbine under all this euphoria and use it to clean up our problems over here," Mr. Perot said.
"One success will not carry anybody very far," he added. "We need to put it behind us and press forward. If we just sit around and high-five one another over the fact that we blew the bejesus out of the Arab world, nothing but arrogance can come out of it."
 
Vietnam's Lessons
How Much Might Is Right?
From the beginning of the military buildup, the confrontation in the gulf was shadowed at every step by the ghosts of Vietnam.
For many Americans, the war banished the ghosts to a degree few people could have hoped for. Instead of the television images of terrified American diplomats fleeing as Saigon fell, the United States saw tearful Kuwaitis hailing Americans as liberators.
Instead of ending in doubt and shame, this war finished with flags, yellow ribbons and swaggering expressions of pride. The New York Post, for instance, published a picture of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq at prayer and the headline "ON HIS KNEES!" And radio station WRAL-FM in Raleigh, N.C., began identifying itself as "broadcasting from the most powerful nation in the world."
For many Vietnam veterans, there was particular pride.
"A lot of people see this as a chance to right old wrongs," said Adrian Cronauer, a communications lawyer in Washington who, as an Armed Forces Radio announcer in Vietnam, provided the model for the Robin Williams character in the movie "Good Morning, Vietnam."
"A lot of people are feeling vindicated," he said. "I think this will put all the negative results of Vietnam behind us."
 
Which Lesson Is Right?
 To Mr. Cronauer and others, the lesson of Iraq is that the nation must be prepared to unleash whatever resources are available when it decides to take military action.
But many experts wonder if that is the right lesson.
Gerald Linderman, a University of Michigan historian who specializes in the effects of American wars at home, said Iraq may have shredded the mythology of Vietnam more than the substance of Vietnam. The idea that the United States lost in Vietnam because of a lack of will or undue restraint is simply false, he said.
"It wasn't that power wasn't exerted in Vietnam, it was that it was unavailing, in part because it was misdirected in that kind of war," he said. "I suspect that no human power could have prevailed in that situation any more than it could have prevailed in Afghanistan. To think this success renders unimportant a previous failure, when in fact they're two entirely different species, could lead us into serious mischief."
Many historians, including John Shy, a University of Michigan military historian, said the peril in the war euphoria is that it could make the United States more likely to use force again.
"Put together with Grenada, with Libya, with Panama, it seems to be the triumphal culmination of a series of episodes in which military power was used as an instrument of foreign policy," Professor Shy said. "I hope it does not induce an arrogance or bully boy behavior in American foreign policy."
 
The World's Policeman
 Others, however, say the success against Iraq will make wars less likely by deterring aggession by others.
"When you carry a big stick, you can talk awfully quietly," said Mr. Novak. "You can even smile."
But it is clear that if the lesson of Vietnam was a sense of the limits of United States power, the lesson of this war is the opposite: that there are few limits to the nation's military might. To war critics, and even to some backers of this war, that is worrisome.
But especially after what most Americans saw as a moral war against a dangerous despot, many are again talking about being the global enforcer.
"I'm not one of those people who believe the cliche we can't be the world's policeman," said Richard Viguerie, the conservative direct-mail specialist. "Well, somebody has to be the world's policeman, or else a lot of people are going to be hurt."
 
Persian Gulf's Lessons
Unity Masks Deep Problems
Basking in victory, many conservatives see a transformed America, newly united and with a new sense of confidence and resolve.
"Who can mount Desert Storm should be able to police Central Park, and who created the Patriots should be able to handle Sony and Mercedes," said the conservative columnist William F. Buckley Jr.
Representative Newt Gingrich, Republican of Georgia, added: "We've just seen a 21st-century army beat a 20th-century army, and I think the challenge to us is to say, 'Let's get the rest of America into the 21st century.' "
But aside from the most ardent conservatives, there is little consensus that victory over Iraq necessarily means improvement at home, in a country that before the war was convulsed with self doubt, disgusted with its politicians and unable to address gaping domestic needs.
"It's going to take more than good will to deal with our problems in education, homelessesness, poverty, declining productivity, and we've never seen George Bush much interested in domestic issues," said Barbara Ehrenreich, a liberal writer and essayist. "Ticker tape isn't going to feed families. Yellow ribbons aren't going to hold bridges up. You can't keep warm under a tent of flags."
 
Darker Side of Patriotism
 And if the war produced expressions of unity and pride, it produced darker undertones as well.
War opponents in many cities said they were subjected to harassment ranging from threatening phone calls to physical abuse. Peg Mullen of Brownsville, Tex., whose search for the truth about her son's death in Vietnam was the subject of the book and movie "Friendly Fire," said she received warnings her house would burn down when she organized a busload of mothers protest in Washington. "I didn't go through any of that in Vietnam," she said. "Then I was allowed to say what I thought."
Others had similar experiences. The actress Margot Kidder was branded a "Baghdad Betty" and subjected to abuse for remarks questioning the war. A Seton Hall University basketball player, Marco Lokar, decided to return home to Italy after being criticized for refusing to wear an American flag on his uniform.
Some say this undercurrent of unease and the still-sagging economy could short-circuit a national celebration of the war.
Kevin Phillips, a political analyst who predicted the Republican surge over the past two decades and who has recently begun predicting its decline, said that without a genuine economic surge, the war euphoria may soon fade. "It's highly unlikely you can have a genuine feel-good era coexisting with this degree of economic concern," he said.
"If we get something else that churns up all those bad feelings again, after all this hype, you could have some very frustrated people out there," he added. "I think they'd be prey for politicians using some form of scapegoating. I can imagine you could get some cultural form of that from the right and some economic version of that from the left."
But for now, more people are struck by the political implications of the positive mood.
The war has left President Bush with approval ratings hovering near 90 percent. That gives him extraordinary leverage with Congress and makes him an overwhelming re-election favorite.
 
Parties Gauge Their Chances
 An economic reversal could alter the mood, but for now Republicans also see the possibility of gains in the House and retaking control of the Senate.
"There's going to be a lot of Democrats, liberals, that are going to rue the day they voted against the war and the Patriot missile," Mr. Viguerie said. "These are recorded votes, and there are going to be a lot of 60-second commercials out there."
Democrats see the risks too. "I think that this is the biggest event in post-Vietnam America, and therefore we have to expect it will have a major effect on the 1992 elections" said Michael Donilon, a poll taker for Democrats.
 
History's Lessons
Perils Facing The Powerful
If Vietnam was the emotional backdrop for judging the war, one book is playing much the same role on an intellectual level.
It is "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers" (Random House, 1987), the sweeping study of international powers since 1500, by the Yale University historian Paul Kennedy.
Its thesis is that throughout history, imperial powers have accelerated their decline by diverting too much energy to military entanglements rather than activities that are more productive economically.
In a short section at the close of the book, Professor Kennedy found the potential for such a decline and what he termed "imperial overstretch" at work in the United States.
 
Using the Wrong Measure
 He said that historically, nations whose economic strength was ebbing have used military victories, often against lesser foes, as misguided signs their power was intact.
People who measure America's strength by the Persian Gulf War are "measuring the wrong measure and shooting at the wrong target," he said in a telephone interview.
"The U.S. has been pouring $300 billion a year into defense throughout the 80's, so it was never a question of there being inadequate military power," he said. "The argument was they were concentrating too much of their energy and resources on defense and neglecting the state of American technical education, infrastructure, indebtedness, high-tech competitiveness, erosion of the social fabric and other problems. To say a swift battlefield victory proves the declinists wrong is a total misinterpreation."
 
The Positive Signs
 Mr. Novak and others argue that Professor Kennedy's thesis fails because he underestimates the nation's economic strength and the broader signs of American pre-eminence, like the collapse of Communism.
Mr. Gingrich said the military and domestic situations are not different at all; rather, the Persian Gulf experience shows that the nation's domestic needs require the same dramatic overhaul the military has received.
Mr. Perot, once thought of as a military hawk, now more of an iconoclast, hopes there is humility as well as pride in the lessons of the war.
"We need to be very, very careful in how we use our power, and not get swept up in going off to war every chance we get," he said. "We could end up with the mind-set that says, 'Gee, we're going to see more Nintendo games on television.' But don't count on that ever happening twice. The next one is going to be just as much of a bloody mess as war always is close up."

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks Up Slightly

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Monday, March 4

 BODY:
Stocks in Tokyo were slightly higher today in light trading. Brokers said the market was treading water, uncertain about the prospects for United States economic recovery and interest-rate cuts.
The Nikkei index of 225 issues finished up 94.45 points, or less than 1 percent, to 25,976.02. At midday, the Nikkei was up 57.65 points, to 25,939.22, with 200 million shares traded. On Friday, the index lost 527.65 points, a 2 percent decline. 
 "Both sellers and buyers are holding back," a senior trader at Merrill Lynch Japan, said after the morning session.
Other traders said uncertainty about interest rates and the weakness of the yen made trading difficult, with large-capitalization, interest-rate sensitive and financial issues all moving sluggishly.
Wall Street gained on Friday on optimism that the United States economy may recover faster than expected. But brokers here said that if the Federal Reserve delayed a further easing of interest rates, an American recovery would be just as much bearish as bullish for Tokyo.
Midday volume was light compared with 400 million shares traded by midday on Friday. Declining issues led gainers by 7 to 4.

HEADLINE: Meadow Star Wins Races and Hearts

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO

DATELINE: HALLANDALE, Fla.

 BODY:
TO the stable people tending her at Barn 15 at Gulfstream Park, she is "little sister." To the groom pampering her in Stall 16, she is "BooBoo." To the clockers, trainers, jockeys and other insiders in the world of thoroughbred racing, she is "the filly."
She is The Filly, indeed. She is Meadow Star, the undefeated and almost unchallenged filly, the winner of all seven races she ever ran, including six stakes races in a row, including even the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, which she polished off by five lengths. And that was three weeks after she won the Frizette by 14 lengths. And that was three weeks after she won the Matron by six lengths. 
 She is chestnut in color with a white patch on her face, she isn't imposing in size, and she is portrayed by her entourage as kind, gentle and intelligent, and by her trainer as "the model of a race horse." She was the reigning filly in America as a 2-year-old in 1990, and she's even-money to continue reigning as a 3-year-old in 1991.
She hasn't raced yet this year, but she will probably make her debut here at Gulfstream within the week. And, in the months ahead, she may capture the public's fancy to a melodramatic degree, perhaps more so than any race horse since Secretariat and more so than any filly since Ruffian.
One reason for the drama is that her owner, Carl Icahn, is donating all her prize money to the Children's Rescue Fund, a charity that he established to provide homes and scholarships for the poor. Icahn, the international financier and owner of Trans World Airlines, is matching gifts to the fund. But Meadow Star, meanwhile, has won $992,830 and figures to become a millionaire philanthropist the next time she races.
"There is something heroic to children about a horse's image, and especially a champion," Icahn said the other day. "We want children to know about her. And if she wins even bigger races, the image may grow and the Rescue Fund will certainly grow."
Another reason for melodrama is that her trainer, Leroy Jolley, is nearing a classic decision: Meadow Star dominated the racing fillies last year, but has never raced against a colt. So, has the time come to race the little filly against the big colts this year? Has the time come to shoot for the ultimate prizes in racing, starting with the Kentucky Derby?
"We're all tantalized with the Triple Crown races," Jolley said. "I don't think anybody in racing doesn't think that way. You're always tempted. But you don't race an average filly against an average colt. Size and strength and other factors have something to do with it."
He paused, and said, "The only time a filly does it is if she's an exceptional filly."
Jolley stood in the rain at 7 o'clock in the morning last Tuesday at Gulfstream Park and watched his exceptional filly take her first formal workout of the year. She did it after resting on her laurels all winter, and after taking life easy with only light work for the last month at the Payson Training Center about 75 miles north of here. She breezed seven-eighths of a mile in 1:27, ran around two turns for the first time in her career and came back to Barn 15 for some walking and caressing.
The trainer, who is a trim man of 53 with piercing blue eyes and a coiled bearing, watched Karen Ross walking his superstar under the shed row for a few turns around the barn. So, he was asked, what's the big decision?
"My mind hasn't been made up yet," he said. "No, not even privately. It depends on, No. 1, how she responds to her training and racing in the next few weeks. No. 2, how the colts are doing, and how many of them there are, and how tough they are. You have to see how the colts look."
Then, as though arguing both sides of the same issue, he said:
"She's not big, but she's the model of a race horse. Beautifully put together. All business when she races. She's better in her races than in her training.
"But you have to be conservative. You can't bite off more than you can chew."
Finally, he confronted his own warning that only an exceptional filly should tackle colts, and he said:
"She's a very exceptional filly. She does everything right. I'm excited about her. I may not look it, but you never know the fires burning inside. Early in her career, she was a good-looking filly but nobody in the stable went out and hocked their car.
"But she went around two turns very well the first time we asked her to do it. She had plenty of rest up at Payson, but she needed to get back to a racing atmosphere. Funny thing, she's almost turned on by it. She's a creature of racing.
"She's had a nice long vacation, and now she needs the stimulation of racing. She's just about ready to run. We'll probably put her in a race here later in the week, then take her to New York and maybe put her in the Comely on March 30. It's a mile, and it's the only race we more or less have carved in stone."
"After that," Jolley said, "the decision will be made."
He paused, and added: "Probably by that time, the decision will make itself. It'll be obvious to everybody."
"The decision," Icahn agreed, "will make itself."
But, speaking by telephone from his office in Mount Kisco, N.Y., he seemed to cast a vote for turning Meadow Star toward the classics.
"We hope she'll go that route," he said.
If she goes that route, she will be adding drama to the growing image of the noble filly, starting with Ruffian in the 1970's and continuing through Genuine Risk and Winning Colors in the 1980's.
The image was enhanced tragically in 1990 when the champion Go for Wand broke down in the final yards of a stirring duel against Bayakoa in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Then, before a shocked crowd at Belmont Park and a national television audience, the courageous filly struggled to her feet and tried to finish the race, only to collapse for good -- a few yards from where Ruffian lies buried at the finish line.
On the same afternoon, Meadow Star raced to her seventh straight victory in a season of success. But Jolley has raced with fillies and against fillies, and he has no illusions.
"With a filly," he said, "it's the luck of the draw. If the owner's interested in breeding, you have fillies. But the economics of the business has changed. Until three years ago, the emphasis was on breeding a filly. But the bloodstock market is down now, and the emphasis is on racing. There are more big races for fillies, more big purses for fillies in racing.
"But the exceptional ones can cross the line and compete with colts. In Europe, they compete very successfully with colts. Look at the Arc."
In the Arc de Triomphe, which is run in the fall, when fillies have matured more, fillies won eight times in 11 years before 1983. They haven't won since then, but they have run second or third every year.
In the Kentucky Derby, only 35 fillies have even been entered in 115 years and only three have won: Regret in 1915, Genuine Risk in 1980 and Winning Colors in 1988. In fact, only four fillies have tried the Derby in the decade since Genuine Risk, but Meadow Star is standing in the wings.
This isn't the first time Jolley has wrestled with the problem of fillies and colts. He knows the rewards, and he knows the risks.
In 1980, he was the trainer of Genuine Risk, who crossed the line and won the Kentucky Derby. And five years before that, he was the trainer of the colt Foolish Pleasure, who won the Kentucky Derby and then ran the storied match race at Belmont Park against Ruffian, the filly champion. They sizzled for half a mile, stride for stride, and then Ruffian snapped her right foreleg and did not survive.
The jockey on Ruffian was Jacinto Vasquez, who had also been the regular rider on Foolish Pleasure. When the horses were paired in the match race, Vasquez had to make a difficult decision. He elected to ride the filly, whom he later mourned as "a gorgeous beast."
Five years later, he was riding for Jolley again and this time his mount was Genuine Risk, who became only the second filly to win the Kentucky Derby. The general feeling in racing seems to be that Meadow Star will try to be the fourth.
It's not clear, though, who will be on her back. Her regular rider, Jose Santos, also rides the champion colt Fly So Free, who has won twice in two starts this year and seven times in nine starts in his career. He is already the early favorite for the Kentucky Derby, and Santos has said he will ride the colt.
So, who will ride the filly? Probably Chris Antley, who rode her once last August at Saratoga when Santos was sitting out a suspension. Antley also went to the Payson complex twice (once by helicopter) in Indiantown to guide Meadow Star through workouts, and he was aboard when she stepped onto the track at Gulfstream last Tuesday morning.
"She's all business," he said later. "She knows her job. When you step on the gas pedal, she responds."
Vasquez, wrapped in a floor-length terrycloth bathrobe, stood on the porch of the jockeys' quarters the other day and peered back through the years and the memories of his "gorgeous beast."
"Fillies are special," he said. "You don't always know how they'll respond to hard training or hard racing. Ruffian and Genuine Risk were able to handle it. They could beat colts. They could beat anybody. Some can do it; some can't.
"I have respect for Leroy Jolley. But he'll have to be careful with Meadow Star. To me, Ruffian was very special. It would be hard to find a race horse like her. When Genuine Risk came along, I didn't think she'd run in the Derby. I told Leroy Jolley: 'Let me get on her a few days after she runs in the Wood and see how she comes back. If she's O.K., then let's go for it.'
"Right now, Meadow Star looks unbeatable. She's very impressive. But there are a lot of colts around. And I don't think you should mix them. Fillies can fall apart."
Icahn, one of the heavy hitters in the investment world, invested $90,000 in the pretty little filly when she was a yearling two years ago at the Keeneland sales in Kentucky.
"I like to breed horses," he said. "But we were lucky buying her. We went to the sales that September and bought four yearlings. I told Rob Whiteley she's worth more, but don't go higher than 90. We just got her at 90."
Whiteley, the director of operations for Icahn's breeding, racing and selling of thoroughbreds, remembered that the yearling's sire, Meadowlake, had been an unproven stallion.
"But he was big and fast," he said. "An exceptionally fast 17-hands horse who had great potential before he was injured. Her mother, Inreality Star, was a daughter of In Reality. And his mares are known for their toughness.
"Before we bought Meadow Star, I went back to see her three times at the sales. She was alert and unflappable. Very professional. The consummate professional.
"She's also very kind and very honest, and that's the most endearing thing I can say about her. It's hard to believe such a gentle filly can be so tough once the gates open."
The gates will open for her in a few days. And, in about one month, Jolley will decide whether to enter her in the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct and two weeks later in the Kentucky Derby, male bastions where only an "exceptional filly" dare enter.

HEADLINE: Rangers Face Major Choices

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

 BODY:
As his second season as a hockey executive comes to an end, Neil Smith of the Rangers finds himself entering what may be the most pivotal two days of his front-office career.
The team's 37-year-old general manager, Smith commands a team that holds first place in the Patrick Division and may take the division title for the second consecutive season. 
 Smith, his players and the hockey public at large know that such a small honor will not satisfy the deep needs and wants at Madison Square Garden, where the Stanley Cup championship was last won in 1940.
The four-round playoffs begin in four weeks and the Rangers must pursue the trophy with the team they have when the trading deadline passes tomorrow.
 
Astute Transactions
 In Smith's brief tenure with the team, his initial trades have proven to be astute. Regular contributors like Bernie Nicholls, Mike Gartner and Kris King were acquired from other teams.
As presently constituted, the Rangers appear to be a good-but-not-great team with a good chance of surviving the first round, a fair chance of winning the second, a possibility of success in the third and a distant hope of prevailing in the final.
To improve upon those chances, Smith plans to be on the telephone this morning with his peers around the league.
There is no clear Stanley Cup favorite this season, although Chicago, St. Louis, Boston, Calgary and Los Angeles seem to be reasonable possibilities. To move into that group, the Rangers may need to make one or two significant trades.
It is much like playing poker: Do you throw away a pair of 10's in the hope of drawing the ace or the king that will fill a straight flush?
In both poker and hockey trades, the operative word is "deal." In the case of the Rangers, that might mean trading one of their rotating goalies, John Vanbiesbrouck or Mike Richter.
 
Seeking a Hot Commodity
 "We are willing to part with anybody, but certainly our strength is in our depth of goaltending," Smith said over the weekend in Toronto, where the Rangers beat the Maple Leafs by 5-2 Saturday.
"It would have to be a lucrative deal," he said. "I feel we have the best two goaltenders in the league and I wouldn't want to give up one unless it was for a hot commodity."
Such a commodity might be a winger who can give the forward lines more aggressiveness. Before joining the Rangers as general manager in 1989, Smith was the chief scout for Detroit. He has long admired Joe Kocur, the Detroit forward whose scarred knuckles attest to his reputation as one of hockey's premier fighters. But Smith isn't sure that one man would solve all the Rangers needs.
"We need a general upgrading of size and strength at the forward positions," Smith said. "It's not something you can do with one move. You can't get a general size change. Our needs are probably not completely satisfiable through a trade."
But a trade this week can affect a team's championship possibilities this spring. It might also change the perception of the top hockey team in the league's largest market.
 
Few Sellouts
 Despite their relative success this season, the Rangers seldom sell out all of their seats. The radio talk shows seem more interested in the failings of the Knicks than the success or failure of the area's three hockey teams. The newspapers are more concerned about the success of the football Giants and the rebuilding of the Mets without Darryl Strawberry.
For a man who grew up in Toronto and learned his skills in Detroit, New York's lack of hockey passion is new to Smith.
"I'm disappointed we're not selling out," Smith said. "We should be; we've got a good product. Some of it probably has to do with the renovation of the interior of the Garden and with the current economic climate.
"Also, Roger Neilson and I have run it at a low profile for the last two years. We don't get the exposure a high-profile management team might bring. I guess that's the price you pay.
"We're all business. We're interested more in winning that in having posters for sale. I think it's time the New York Rangers had less celebrity status and more winning percentage. People in New York don't really get interested in hockey until the playoffs anyway. Until then, it's more like just another show. Should we go see 'Cats' or the Rangers?"
 
No Ripple Effect
 Smith said last week's shakeup of top Garden management would have little effect on him. Jack Diller no longer oversees the Knicks, only the Rangers. Smith said this could only increase communication and access between the two.
But the Garden authorities have been known to be impatient with slow building programs. As the New York sports world gives hockey its turn this spring, the fans, the news media and maybe even Smith's bosses will be asking the familiar question: Is this the year?
"It could be," Smith said. "We certainly want it to be. We also are aware that we intend to be in this contending position for the next few years. We hope that this year we can reach for the brass ring and grab it. We certainly intend to win."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR;
New U.S. Hint on Hussein

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 3

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d hinted today that Iraq might be accorded a lighter reparations bill for rebuilding Kuwait if President Saddam Hussein were overthrown.
"The degree to which the coalition and other countries would actively prosecute their claims I think might be affected to some degree by whether or not that regime is still in power," Mr. Baker said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." 
 His comments came only hours after the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution on terms for ending hostilities that called on Iraq to accept liability for damages caused by its invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Preliminary estimates of damages have reached tens of billions of dollars.
Mr. Baker said talks during his forthcoming tour of the Middle East would deal with creating new regional security arrangements, arms control and economic cooperation. Cautioning that "we can't impose peace," he said he would not carry a specific Arab-Israeli peace plan with him.
He said that a United States peace plan "would be shot up like a Scud missile with a couple of Patriots."
Mr. Baker expressed mild optimism for the prospects of reducing tensions in following the Gulf war, although he added that the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors "is so intractable, and it has been there for so long, and the issues are so deep that divide."
He said all Washington could do was serve as a "catalyst" to bring Israelis and Arabs together. "We have got to find a way for Arab states and Israel to make peace; and we have got to find a way for Israel and Palestinians to begin a dialogue," Mr. Baker said.
Even though Jordan gave verbal support and apparently some weapons to Iraq during the crisis, Mr. Baker expressed a positive attitude toward King Hussein. "It may very well be," Mr. Baker said, that as we move forward here, Jordan and King Hussein himself personally may become a very important player in this."

HEADLINE: Don't Skimp on Treatment for Addiction

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Doctors Press States to Curb Reviews of Procedures' Costs" (front page, Feb. 13), you report on the battle between insurance companies and physicians over medical review companies, which attempt to limit health-care costs. It didn't surprise me that, to put a human face on the issue, you use the case of a California man whose death may have resulted from his premature release from a drug-treatment program. 
 According to a survey released last December by the benefits consulting firm of Foster Higgins & Company, nearly 9 in 10 employers limit benefits for alcoholism, other drug dependence and mental disorders, although 52 percent of the survey participants could not say how much it cost them to provide any kind of treatment for these diseases.
But we do know the price society pays for leaving them untreated. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that alcoholism and drug dependence cost the country at least $144 billion in 1988. Treatment-related expenditures account for just 11 percent of that figure; lost or reduced productivity, mortality and other costs that are not related to health, such as crime, law enforcement and property destruction, make up the rest.
While the long-range economic folly of cuts in benefits for alcohol treatment and drug treatment is obvious in light of these estimates -- which are rock bottom according to the Government -- specialists in addiction medicine are even more troubled by a system that has begun increasingly to discriminate against alcoholics and other drug-dependent people.
The review companies who have been mandated to control costs are less likely to second-guess the hospitalization needs of a patient who has been diagnosed with heart disease than one with a life-threatening addiction because their decisions are more often informed by their moral beliefs than by any medical expertise or professional standards.
Specialists in addiction medicine and organizations such as the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence will continue to fight for access to treatment that meets the needs of individuals, but it appears that in this environment, we will have to rely on economic arguments as much as compassion and understanding.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: United Nations;
U.N. Compromise Plan To Widen Relief to Iraq

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 3

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council pledged tonight to exempt more food and humanitarian aid from its trade embargo against Iraq and speed authorization for delivering the supplies to needy people there.
The decision, announced by Austria, this month's Council president, represented a compromise between the United States and its gulf war allies and a group of members who wanted trade sanctions lifted altogether on goods needed to preserve public health in Iraq. 
 The gulf allies say they are ready to send Iraq more humanitarian supplies to relieve suffering and stem the danger of epidemics resulting from polluted water and poor medical services. But they plan to do so on an exceptional basis without changing the Council's decision to ban all trade with Iraq except medicines.
The coalition partners say they are opposed to any formal weakening of the Security Council's economic embargo aganst Iraq at this stage because they are still pressing Baghdad to comply fully with their terms for a formal cease-fire.
 
Cease-Fire Resolution Approved
 Saturday night the Council approved a new resolution endorsing the conditions for a cease-fire and reaffirming the trade sanctions against Iraq as well as the allies' right to attack Iraq again if it does not make peace on their terms.
In a letter to the Council today, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said the Iraqi Government had accepted the resolution and "will fulfill its obligations under the said resolution."
He asked the Security Council to declare a formal cease-fire and to lift all sanctions against Baghdad.
As a result of the compromise tonight, five Council members, India, Cuba, Yemen, Ecuador and Zimbabwe, withdrew a resolution they had circulated that would have formally lifted the Security Council's trade embargo on food as well as on machinery and supplies used for purifying water and generating electricity.
 
Health Reports Prompt Appeal
 The five countries introduced this resolution after the World Health Organization and Unicef reported last week that Iraqi children are short of food and that hospitals and water treatment plants, operating without public electricity, desperately need portable generators and fuel.
The Council wants a special committee empowered to approve humanitarian exceptions to the embargo to speed up its work and take a more generous approach, allowing shipment of a wider range of supplies.
Today the committee examined the W.H.O.-Unicef report and asked for more details on what equipment Iraq needs to improve health standards. Diplomats said W.H.O. and Unicef will supply this information in the next few days when the committee is likely to give the green light for these supplies to be sent in.
 
Resolution Gets 11 Votes
 At today's meeting the committee also approved requests by the Danish and Belgian Red Cross to send in food for children. Last week it allowed Iran to send in some 700 tons of food.
The new resolution endorsing President Bush's cease-fire terms was supported by 11 of the Council's 15 members. Only Cuba voted against it while China, India and Yemen abstained.

HEADLINE: Big Developments Stalled in New York's Real-Estate Slump

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
At Columbus Circle, where the gigantic Columbus Center complex was supposed to be, there is a modern "Hooverville" outside the vacant New York Coliseum, an encampment of homeless people in crudely built shelters who warm themselves at night over fires in open drums.
Not far away, in the deserted railroad yards along the Hudson River where Donald J. Trump has dreamed of building his own city since 1984, the only thing that has gone up is vegetation. Mr. Trump is close to an agreement with civic groups and the city on a scaled-down version of his plans. 
 The yawning vaults under the Queensboro Bridge, where the Bridgemarket food center was to have been, will stay empty indefinitely. No 60-story South Ferry Plaza office tower will rise at Manhattan's tip, and no one lives at 108 East 96th Street, an empty unfinished shell of an apartment building.
 
Emblems of Both a Boom and Distress
 Each of these projects, in its own way, was emblematic of the building boom that transformed and transfixed New York City in the 1980's. Now each, in its own peculiar limbo, is emblematic of the city's distress.
In a city where construction cranes are as much a part of the local topography as hills or shoreline, the entire civic character seems out of kilter when development slackens -- even if it means that there might be time to plan more rationally for the future.
In all, more than 40 developments that began to take form in the last decade are now dead, delayed or mired. Many have been scuttled, or at least hobbled, by the worst real-estate market since the 1970's. And while many others seem to be victims more of legal maneuvers or bureaucracy than market forces, their developers would probably have moved much faster a few years ago to settle the suits or obtain permits.
This slowdown has left gaping holes not only in the streetscape but in the private and public economies. Thousands of jobs have been lost in the building and real-estate fields, and with them, much money that had been spent on high-priced dwellings, goods and services. At the same time, the municipal budget is missing millions in real-estate tax revenues.
 
Plenty of Space for Tenants to Choose From
 No change is in immediate sight, particularly because banks, stuck with many loans that are unlikely to be repaid, have turned their backs on construction lending. Moreover, what tenants there might be for new office space have plenty to choose from: whole skyscrapers sitting freshly built and nearly empty.
Perhaps the greatest obstacle to big projects at the moment, besides the lack of tenants and financing, is a court decision.
In November, Justice Ira Gammerman of State Supreme Court overturned two amended zoning rules -- one applying to large-scale developments, the other to developments on rail yards -- under which several projects had been approved by the city, thereby effectively blocking the projects themselves. Justice Gammerman found a "failure" on the part of city officials "to identify and assess the reasonably foreseeable environmental consequences" of the zoning changes. The city is appealing.
Even with construction at its quietest in years, several office towers and hotels are going up. The revised Trump City plan that appears to be moving forward again, even at 57 percent of its former size, would be a huge enterprise. And officials insist that construction will begin on such ambitious and long-delayed efforts as the four-tower Times Square Center and two Federal buildings around Foley Square.
Still, what follows is a profile of development at a standstill.

HEADLINE: Yanks Hope Sanderson Has Good Start

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MARTINEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., March 3

 BODY:
Even with all their woeful offensive problems last season, the Yankees began their winter by continuing their never-ending search for pitching.
What they found was a starter, Scott Sanderson, and a reliever, Steve Farr, who probably make them better but don't necessarily solve what has become an annual puzzle. 
 Sanderson could possibly be their best catch of the off season. But can he?
Last season, with the Oakland A's, he had a career-high 17 victories, pitched 206 innings and did not miss a starting assignment, working 34 times. But that was Oakland; this is the Yankees.
 
Winning Isn't Easy
 "If it was as easy as throwing your glove on the mound, then I say ask Mike Moore how easy it was for him last season," Sanderson said. "You don't win unless you pitch well. Everybody talks about the A's offense, but they might have been in the middle of the pack in runs scored."
The Athletics were actually third in runs, but they were 12th in team batting average. Moore may have suffered most from the dropoff, going from a 19-11 record in 1989 to 13-15 last season.
Sanderson, who is 34 years old, assumed that his durability and his 17-11 record would earn him a new contract with Oakland. He accepted Oakland's offer of arbitration, then 36 hours later found that he had been traded to the Yankees. He signed a two-year deal valued at $4.5 million.
The A's later conceded that the economic climate had left them with little chance to win in arbitration, and it would have probably cost them well over $1 million to keep Sanderson, who made $850,000 in 1990. Instead, they acquired cheaper talent: just as Sanderson had replaced Storm Davis in the A's rotation the season before, Eric Show will replace Sanderson.
"It doesn't remain a complete mystery to me," Sanderson said, "but there are some unanswered questions. I have no resentment toward the A's, though. I only have good memories."
 
Reliable Starter
 The Yankees are hoping they have good memories of Sanderson when the season ends. Like others in the rotation -- Tim Leary, Mike Witt, Chuck Cary and either Andy Hawkins or Dave Eiland -- he is reliable without being exceptional.
"Whoever our fifth starter is," said the Yankee pitching coach, Mark Connor, "we have four guys who are capable of winning 15 games or more. With the exception of Chuck, they've all done it."
Sanderson doesn't give the Yankees what they need most of all -- a No. 1 pitcher -- but he insists that the term is overused and misunderstood.
"How important is a No. 1, an ace, the day after he pitches and the next three days after that?" he said. "Whoever is the starter that day is No. 1. I don't care if you're talking about Roger Clemens, Dwight Gooden or Dave Stewart."
Sanderson is none of those, but he is dependable, having won 28 games over the last two seasons (he spent 1989 with the Chicago Cubs) and made 57 starts during that span.
Last season, he added a forkball to his fastball and curve, which he hopes will induce more ground-ball outs.
"I'm hoping it won't go as far," Sanderson said, smiling. "It should be a ground-ball and strikeout pitch."
Last season, Sanderson gave up 27 home runs. Only Dave Johnson of the Baltimore Orioles (30) and Dennis Rasmussen of the San Diego Padres (28) gave up more in the majors.
"I like what I've seen so far of it, and it's not even there yet," Connor said. "It's a pitch that starts in the strike zone and ends up out of it. It's not a pitch everybody can throw."
Now, Sanderson needs to translate it into victories, which clearly won't come as easily as they did with the A's.
"I'm going to try and do the same things I did with Oakland," he said. "That was to show them they made the right choice in signing me."

HEADLINE: DIALOGUE: The Gulf War's Aftermath
Is the Vietnam Syndrome Dead?;
No, Hussein Was One of a Kind

BYLINE: By Eric Alterman; Eric Alterman, a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute, is writing a book about political pundits.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
All right, so the peaceniks were wrong about one thing. There will be no tens of thousands of body bags coming home and thus no popular reaction of revulsion and horror against the Persian Gulf war. President Bush's popularity ratings are off the charts and even the most hawkish of "pro-sanctions" Democrats are running for cover, musing about 1996. Politically and militarily, Operation Desert Storm is a rout.
But does this mean, as many try to claim, that America has finally exorcised the ghost of Vietnam? The question itself implies a misunderstanding of the underlying factors that created the Vietnam syndrome. 
 Although neo-conservatives sneered at the "culture of appeasement" it allegedly bespoke, the nation's reluctance to involve itself directly in the wars of the 1980's represented a lasting and significant confluence of thinking between military leaders and the American citizenry.
Following Vietnam, the military saw itself nearly destroyed by fighting an inconclusive, unpopular and probably illegal war. That trauma instilled in it an unshakable respect for the Clausewitzian dictums that wars should be undertaken only on behalf of what former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger called "clearly defined objectives" and only "with the reasonable assurance" that they would enjoy "the support of the American people and their elected representatives in Congress."
Our brass learned to read polling data as effectively as they did battlefield intelligence. They were hardly eager to see their precious resources, military or political, squandered in a war that lacked overwhelming support, had no clear definition of victory and offered plenty of jungles and mountains conducive to a long drawn-out guerrilla campaign.
From Vietnam, Americans learned the cost of blind obeisance to their leaders. Though "Nicaragua" may not be a perfect Spanish translation for "Vietnam," it sounded sufficiently similar to American ears to prevent a rerun of our tragic sideshow in that decidedly unvital part of the world. Ronald Reagan used every trick in his great communicator's bag to convince Americans that the conflicts in Central America merited a direct U.S. military response. But the opinion polls always came back, "No thanks."
So, are we really ready to get back into the war fighting business?
To answer in the affirmative, one must be confident that the U.S. is likely to find a villain as convincingly evil as Saddam Hussein; victims as unarguably aggrieved as the Kuwaitis; threatened resources as "vital" to our way of life as petroleum; an enemy as vulnerable to U.S. military doctrine as was the Iraqi Army.
None of these conditions is likely to be reproduced anytime soon. It's not that Saddam Hussein, as President Bush has tried to argue, is uniquely evil. Our erstwhile gulf ally, Hafez al-Assad of Syria, gives him more than a run for his money on that score. It's that Mr. Hussein provided a unique combination of evil and stupidity.
He not only invaded a country that supplies oil to the entire Western world but he threatened our regional allies as well. Moreover, he did so on a terrain that left his soldiers no place to hide in exactly the kind of orthodox land war that NATO has been planning for 40 years.
Is there anybody out there nasty and stupid enough to try that again?
In the Philippines, the New Peoples Army may be unpleasant fellows, but they are smart enough to conduct their war on an island archipelago. In Peru, the Shining Path guerrillas have jungles and mountains on their side. Neither one sits on any oil. In China, Deng Xiaoping had the good sense to bond with George Bush before conducting his terror campaign.
Most of the world's potential military conflicts, from Slovenia to East Jerusalem, have their roots in ancient ethnic, political and economic legacies. These are exactly the kinds of morally and militarily complicated interventions that the nation has forsworn as unwinnable and unworth it.
The cold war is history, with the Soviets fighting exclusively among themselves. The new world order is a pipe dream. So given all these caveats, just who is it that Americans should prepare to fight? Vanessa Redgrave?
Despite the cheerleading of our armchair infantrymen, the Vietnam syndrome remains in place. Saddam Hussein is a one-of-a-kind bad guy. Now, if only our real long-term threats -- weakening productivity, a deteriorating environment, collapsing infrastructure and third-rate education system -- provided such spectacular television visuals.

HEADLINE: California Jobless Rate Soars After Cold Ravages Oranges

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: FRESNO, Calif., March 4

 BODY:
The freeze that ravaged California's navel orange crop sent unemployment rates soaring, with nearly one of every five workers unemployed in one hard-hit county, the state reported today.
Tulare County, in the heart of the citrus groves, had a jobless rate of 19.7 percent in January, the State Department of Employment reported. That was up 5 percent from December as 5,500 people were added to the unemployment rolls.
Neighboring Fresno and Kern Counties also are agricultural but fared slightly better. January's unemployment reached 13.7 percent in Fresno and 12.7 percent in Kern.
The severity of the layoffs in Tulare County is illustrated by Food Link, a private, nonprofit food bank.

HEADLINE: Gulf Victory May Raise U.S. Influence in OPEC

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
By virtue of its military victory, the United States is likely to have more influence in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries than any industrial nation has ever exercised. But in the short term, the Administration may not try to exercise this influence.
American officials say they are just beginning to discuss how they might use their new franchise. The first opportunity would arise if crude oil prices plunged from the current level of nearly $20 a barrel. In that event, Washington might lean on a reluctant Saudi Arabia to cut production and push prices back up to a range of $18 to $22. 
 Many economists consider that a suitable level for the American economy, since it is high enough to encourage conservation and allow American energy companies to make profits but low enough that gasoline and heating oil remain affordable, encouraging economic growth.
 
An Unseen Presence at Talks
 When representatives of the 13 OPEC nations gather in Geneva next week, Administration officials will not attend, even as observers. But they will be sitting figuratively at the elbow of Saudi Arabia and the other oil-producing states of the Arabian peninsula.
"I think we are going to see a closer relationship between the gulf oil producers and ourselves," said John J. Easton Jr., Assistant Secretary of Energy for international affairs and energy emergencies. "We had been laying the foundation for some time, and the house was built very quickly when the war came."
The peninsula's two biggest oil producers now, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, account for 18 percent of the world's production. When Kuwait eventually regains its prewar output, roughly 22 percent of the world's oil will come from those three nations, all of which sought American help after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
It is through Saudi Arabia that the Administration will have its greatest influence, American officials and oil specialists say. Because that country produces 14 percent of the world's output -- and exports nearly all of it -- it can influence prices more than any other country by raising or lowering its production.
 
Saudis 'Know What to Do'
 "If prices rose substantially and the Saudis had spare production capacity, they would be asked by the United States to increase production," said John H. Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "But they would not have to be asked, because they would know what to do."
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and officials of his Government have said their policy is to keep oil prices at about $21 a barrel. The Saudis say, in fact, that they may have to raise production this year to counter pressure for higher prices as demand rises in Europe, Asia and perhaps the United States.
The test of the Bush Administration's new leverage will come if the Saudis are wrong. If higher demand failed to materialize, oil inventories could build up, causing prices to plunge. Some analysts expect this to happen by late summer. The White House might then lean on the Saudis to cut production. And the Saudis might resist.
 
Precedent of 1986
 That is what happened in 1986, the last time oil prices fell sharply, to as low as $7 a barrel. The Saudis caused the plunge by flooding the world market with oil, to punish OPEC partners that were pumping more than their agreed-upon quotas and to demonstrate their power over pricing.
Mr. Bush, then the Vice President, traveled to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to argue for restoring an $18 price level, an effort that brought public criticism from American advocates of cheap oil. In those days, the United States did not have the influence over the Saudis that it presumably has today, and it was seven months before prices began to rise as the Saudis finally relented and cut production.
Saudi Arabia is now producing nearly 8.4 million barrels a day, having raised its output during the gulf crisis to help offset the loss of supplies from Iraq and Kuwait. Now the Saudis say they need all the oil revenue they can obtain to pay war costs. That raises the possibility that they will balk again at any American request to cut production to, say, the level of 5.3 million barrels a day that prevailed in July.
 
Goal of Mutual Benefit
 Would the Administration drop such a request for lower production and forgo exercising its influence? Perhaps, the experts say. "Some in Government may disagree," said Mr. Easton of the Energy Department, "but I for one don't believe that we can wave a wand at the Saudis and they'll automatically respond. The challenge is to find an action beneficial to both of us."
More than a dozen Bush Administration officials and oil industry analysts suggested in interviews last week that although the Administration had new clout on oil prices, they preferred to describe the new American influence in different terms.
Some contend, for example, that the United States' goal should be obtaining easy access to an abundant supply of Middle Eastern oil. In this view, the war was fought in part to prevent Iraq from using its military power to control, and to limit, the flow of oil in an effort to drive up prices.
 
Approval of Expanded Capacity
 This abundant-supply approach is reflected in frequent expressions of approval for Saudi Arabia's efforts to expand its production capacity to 10 million barrels a day or more. Oil analysts and Government officials also speak of rebuilding Kuwait's oil production centers to a capacity well above the pre-invasion level of 2.5 million barrels a day.
"Successful reconstruction policies have the potential to create substantial excess capacity, and this new ability to step up production should act as a brake on rising oil prices," said Lawrence H. Summers, chief economist of the World Bank.
Then there is President Bush's style. "Dictating prices is not his modus operandi," said a high Administration official who declined to be quoted by name. "The President would prefer that people work out prices in their own way, staying within reason."
 
$21 a Barrel a Likely Goal
 "Within reason" means OPEC's current target price of $21 a barrel, set at an OPEC meeting in July over the objections of Iraq, which sought a $25 price to raise additional revenue to pay debts from its eight-year war with Iran.
Crude oil from OPEC's various producers is now averaging $17 to $18 a barrel, but the $21 target price is likely to be affirmed in Geneva next week.
The Bush Administration also counts on oil in the $18 to $22 range. In their most recent projections for the American economy, this was the price range assumed by the Treasury Department, the President's Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and Budget.
"It would be disadvantageous for the American economy if the price were to fall into the low teens," said Sidney Jones, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for economic policy.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Reshaping Laws On Insurance

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
HEALTH insurers are rushing to formulate their own plans for making coverage available to small businesses and individuals. The insurers hope to shape new laws being drafted that will crack down on practices like the blacklisting of certain occupations, red-lining of neighborhoods and price gouging.
But the commercial insurers and Blue Cross and Blue Shield groups are fighting one another on some issues. Under the commercial companies' plan, the 10 largest insurers of small groups in each state would pay for a backup reinsurance pool to help cover high-risk customers. But some Blue Cross groups already cover all applicants, albeit at high premiums. So the national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association says participation in reinsurance pools should not be compulsory in every state. 
 Under both the Blue Cross and the commercial proposals, coverage would be offered to all applicants, regardless of health status, occupation or geographic location. For those labeled as high risks, premiums could still be 50 percent higher than for others. That would be progress, the insurers say, compared with 400 percent differentials charged by some companies.
The Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group for 300 commercial insurers, is pushing a package with reinsurance in New Jersey, Minnesota and Maine and says it will probably be offered soon in Ohio and Wisconsin. "These are proposals that would greatly restrict our ability to make money in the small group market," said Carl Schramm, the association president.
But in a policy called open enrollment, Blue Cross plans already accept all comers in 13 states and the District of Columbia. In most cases, they charge the same rates, regardless of occupation or health status, which is called community rating. These associations object to helping the commercial companies with the reinsurance plan.
Individuals in New York state can obtain Blue Cross coverage at any time, said Albert A. Cardone, chairman of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield. Although new members are not covered during the first 11 months for pre-existing conditions, they are fully covered afterward, even for AIDS. But Empire has stopped covering some professional associations, and their members must now pay the individual rates, which are higher. "Everybody has health insurance accessible to them," Mr. Cardone said. "The problem is they can't all afford it."
The reinsurance idea is being tested in Connecticut, where the pool will begin on May 1. Connecticut Blue Cross officials said the new law would actually force the association to start "medical underwriting" for the first time, to stay competitive. In medical underwriting, higher premiums are charged to those who have had expensive health problems.
Mary Nell Lehnhard, a national Blue Cross vice president, said the Connecticut law might raise the cost of all health insurance. "Twenty percent of the people enrolled tpically incur about 80 percent of the costs," she said. "If costs for the 20 percent are reduced, they will have to be raised quickly for a lot of people, which could cause political problems." The issue is being debated by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The group is drafting a model law, to be recommended to legislatures and regulators in the 50 states.
In Congress, Pete Stark, chairman of the health subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he favored a bill that would restore tax exemption to Blue Cross plans that offer open enrollment and community rating.
Only 21 of the 73 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans might qualify for tax exemption under the bill, which is sponsored by Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan. But the national Blue Cross supports it. The measure will probably be part of the next tax package.
Mr. Stark is considering taking the Rangel approach a step further. Arguing that the industry's proposals for change would not reach enough of the 37 million uninsured Americans, Mr. Stark said he was thinking of requiring all insurers to offer open enrollment and community rating. The new rules would also apply to self-insured employers, who are exempt from many regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
Mr. Stark's plan was criticized by insurance industry spokesmen. "Mr. Stark is in pursuit of a romantic ideal," said Mr. Schramm of the health insurance association. Health-cost inflation would "jump to over 20 percent a year," he said, if rates could not be tied to medical histories. Bernard R. Tresnowski, president of national Blue Cross and Blue Shield, said, "We've got to be able to take demographic factors into account, particularly age."

HEADLINE: Careers;
Two Growth Areas Beckon In Recession

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
BECAUSE of the recession, college students more than ever are searching for growth areas, even if they have to add a master's degree.
Prof. Lawrence K. Williams of Cornell University and Prof. Donald W. Collins of Arizona State University have two suggestions -- the so-called human resource field for liberal arts majors and waste management for science majors. 
 Professor Williams, administrator of graduate studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said retailers and financial companies were "not in the market" for liberal arts majors. "Graduates with degrees in areas where jobs are in short supply are coming to us for advanced study in human resources," he said.
Companies concerned with matching human resources with business strategy have been spending more on personnel departments to provide "a competitive edge," he explained.
Human resource departments deal with a company's employees. They handle relations with unions, executive compensation and bonuses, health and retirement benefits, discrimination and harassment charges, day care, maternity leave, part-time work and disciplinary problems, including drug abuse. Hiring M.B.A.'s and college graduates is part of the job, as well as establishing career routes.
Companies want to attract "young and vigorous people to manage these areas," Professor Williams said.
Students realize the broad scope of the field of human resources, he said. Applications for Cornell's two-year program leading to a master of industrial relations degree have jumped sharply this year. but Professor Williams said he did not expect enrollment to increase much beyond the 65 in the program, plus 60 working for doctorates.
"It allows us to be more selective," he said. "We look for balance -- good verbal and mathematics scores." Every student gets a well-paid summer internship. After receiving the master's degree, most start with big companies at $42,000 to $50,000.
He added: "Most of the Generals recruit here -- General Motors, General Foods, General Electric. This is a big year for petroleum recruiters -- Exxon, Chevron, ARCO and Amoco."
Graduates who start with big companies often move to small ones and a higher position after a few years, possibly as vice president of human resources.
In the past, managers in this field had what Professor Williams calls "low shelf skills," which means they filled a niche, like a specialty in employee benefits, and tended to stay in it. Many held M.B.A. degrees, which included a few courses in industrial relations and organizational behavior.
"Our training is more general," Professor Williams said. "We give them diagnostic skills -- law courses, economics and organizational behavior. We want them to have long-lasting research skills and a long shelf life." he explained.
Programs in human resources are not new. The interest in professional degree programs began after World War II, Professor Williams recalled.
Professor Collins, who is chairman of the department of industrial and manufacturing technology at Arizona State, acknowledges that engineers and some science majors have less difficulty in finding jobs than liberal arts students. But he says that "some of the hottest job opportunites of the decade will be in specialties like hazardous material, safety and waste management."
"Consider one agency -- the Department of Energy," he said. "The cleanup campaign for nuclear power plants required by law involves a 30-year program. It predicts the need to recruit 20,000 to 25,000 employees to do this job, and there must be managers to guide them."
The university offers a new master of technology degree in the field. "We have had courses in waste management and the environment for four years, but we have awarded the degree only in the last two," Professor Collins said. "It's a one-year program requiring 32 credit hours. Students need a strong science background, especially in chemistry. We have 36 students in the program, of which 18 are full time."
Students attend classes on Fridays and Saturdays because many are sent by their companies, Professor Collins said. "Few come from out of state because we have done no advertising, but now we are doing mailings," he said. "I would like to see the program grow to 100 a year." Salaries range widely from $28,000 to $65,000, depending on background, he said.
"The University of California has such a program and we have patterned ours on that one," Professor Collins said, adding that universities would increasingly offer courses in waste management, chiefly in civil or industrial engineering departments. He also hopes to start a doctor of technology program in the fall, he said.

HEADLINE: Nicaragua Devalues Money To Stem Economic Collapse

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, March 4

 BODY:
Trying to satisfy Nicaragua's international creditors without setting off another round of violent strikes by Sandinista labor unions, President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro began a new economic stabilization program today based on a major devaluation of the currency.
"We have already exchanged war for peace," Mrs. Chamorro told the nation in a televised address on Sunday. "Now we are going to exchange economic disaster for the stability we all want." 
 She presented the plan after several days of uncertainty that saw commerce come almost to a halt over price confusion and the nearly worthless cordoba drop from 7 million to the dollar to about 12 million in one day of street trading on Friday.
The Government intends to replace the existing cordoba over the next two months with the so-called gold cordoba -- actually a bill, too -- that it created last year on a par with the dollar. The gold cordoba has so far served mainly as a way to guarantee bank deposits and loans.
The new parities are five gold cordobas to the dollar and five million old cordobas to a gold cordoba. The old cordoba is to disappear by the end of April.
The package also includes increases in state salaries and in the wholesale prices of basic foods and fuel, in public transportation and in utilities, but generally by three or four times the existing levels, not the five times the devaluation seemed to represent.
Mrs. Chamorro also promised to push ahead with her commitment to liberalize the economy, still struggling under the weight of the heavy state structure created during nearly 11 years of rule by the Sandinistas, but offered few specifics.
Although many in Mrs. Chamorro's Government think Nicaragua deserves more economic help with fewer strings attached than what it is now receiving from the United States and other leading nations, these steps were timed to impress donors and would-be donors with the Government's economic seriousness.
Representatives of donor nations are scheduled to meet in Washington on March 25 and 26 to consider an aid package for Nicaragua that would pay off its $350 million in arrears to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
Trying to head off labor and other opposition that could destroy any hope of reviving Nicaragua's prostrate economy, Mrs. Chamorro's chief minister, Antonio Lacayo, spent the past week discussing elements of the plan with virtually every sector of Nicaraguan society.
The key group, the Sandinista Front, along with the labor movement affiliated with it, the National Workers Front, has been critical but did not immediately mount public protests or strikes.
The labor group met on Sunday night and announced that it was rejecting what it characterized as a "shock" treatment. The group declared that the plan violated what it said was Mr. Lacayo's promise to take gradual measures.
Seeming to take a negotiating position, the labor group demanded, among other things, that salaries be raised by about twice what Mr. Lacayo announced. It called for workers to "mobilize" in defense of these demands but said the precise steps would be discussed in meetings of individual unions starting today.
These measures are similar to stabilization attempts that President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and the Sandinista Front made in the last year of their Government, with the difference, Mr. Lacayo said, that this Government counts with international support to back up the currency and make the plan work.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Lowest Since 1982

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
New-home sales plunged in January to their lowest level in eight and a half years, the Government said today, but analysts, saying buyers had become more active in recent weeks, forecast a modest improvement this year.
"January was a month of high anxiety," with spending curtailed because of concern over the Persian Gulf war and the recession, said Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. 
 The Commerce Department and the Housing and Urban Development Department said sales fell 12.3 percent, to 408,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, in January. That was the lowest level since the 407,000 rate in August 1982.
 
War Anxiety Cited
 "Housing activity stalled in the first half of the month as the clock ticked away" on the deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait, said David G. Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders.
Since then, however, "we've been getting a lot of reports that things are looking pretty good," he said, citing an increase in buyer traffic and more optimistic expectations by builders.
John A. Tuccillo, an economist at the National Association of Realtors, agreed, saying, "Continuous reports of allied successes had eased consumer anxiety by late January, and many markets reported a notable increase in home-buying traffic."
New-home sales have fallen for two years, and in January were 35 percent below January 1990.
The Government also said today that the median price of a new home fell 4 percent, to $121,800, in January. Median means half of the homes cost more, half less.
At the end of the month, the seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale totaled 316,000. That represented a 9.3-month supply of unsold units, the highest level since a 9.4-month supply in April 1982.
Because builders tend to postpone construction when inventories are high, the report raised the possibility of more layoffs in the housing industry.
 
Construction Jobs Lost
 The Labor Department has reported that 155,000 construction jobs were lost in January, although it blamed unusually bad weather for some of the decrease. The overall weakness in the construction industry has caused 450,000 workers to be cut from payrolls since May.
Today's report said sales of new homes were off nationwide. In the South, sales plunged 17.5 percent, to an annual rate of 160,000, the lowest since the Government began keeping records in 1973. Sales had slipped 6.7 percent in December.
In the Midwest, sales fell 14 percent, to 74,000, after being flat the previous month. Sales were off 12.3 percent, to 57,000, in the Northeast, where sales had fallen 5.8 percent a month earlier. And they dropped 1.7 percent in the West, to 117,000, after declining 5.3 percent in December.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar and Gold End Mixed; Jobless Report Is Awaited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar closed mixed against the leading foreign currencies yesterday as traders took a breather after the dollar's big gains last week. Gold prices were also mixed.
After a strong rise last week, the dollar's levels were due for some adjustments, said Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager of the Bank of New York. He said the market was now in the process of consolidating "before the trend resumes on the upside." 
 Analysts said the market continued to shift attention away from the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war and back to technical and economic factors. They said traders were waiting for the release of the Government's employment report, due out on Friday, for an indication of whether the economy was moving out of recession.
If the employment numbers are strong, the Federal Reserve would be under less pressure to relax interest rates. When rates are stable or moving up, the dollar tends to gain value.
In Europe, dealers said the dollar moved narrowly during the session, reflecting concerns among traders that the end of the gulf war alone would not create the demand needed to support the dollar.
 
Pound Climbs
 The British pound gained against the American currency, closing at $1.9008 in New York, up from $1.8960 late Friday. Earlier in London, the pound rose to $1.8975, from $1.8970 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Friday prices, were: 1.53265 German marks, down from 1.5385; 1.3355 Swiss francs, unchanged, 5.2185 French francs, down from 5.2415; 1,144.75 Italian lire, down from 1,150.50, and 1.15515 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15205.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with the late Friday prices, were: 1.5365 German marks, unchanged; 1.3390 Swiss francs, up from 1.3320; 5.2335 French francs, down from 5.2350; 1.7320 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7315; 1,147.50 Italian lire, down from 1,148.50, and 1.1555 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1530.
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen, closing at 135.49 yen in New York, up from 134.60 on Friday. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 135.35 yen, up 1.10 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 135.50 yen.
Gold closed at $367.90 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, up 90 cents an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $367.40, also up 90 cents.
Gold finished unchanged in London at a late bid price of $366 an ounce.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Expected Cut in Oil Output Pushes Crude Prices Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Petroleum futures prices jumped yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders bought contracts on the expectation of production cuts by OPEC members.
Crude oil futures settled 25 cents to 87 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in April up 87 cents at $20.25 a barrel. Home heating oil was 1.55 cents to 1.84 cents higher, with April at 56.13 cents a gallon. Unleaded gasoline rose 1.65 cents to 3.95 cents, with April at 69.40 cents a gallon. Natural gas was 0.6 cent lower to 1.5 cents higher, with April at $1.355 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
 Crude prices were bolstered by widespread expectations that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would agree at a meeting next week in Geneva to cut production in hopes of raising crude prices to an OPEC target of $21 a barrel, said James Steel, an analyst with Refco Inc. in New York.
 
Saudis in Command
 He said the defeat of Iraq by forces led by the United States had left Saudi Arabia in a commanding position among OPEC nations.
The Saudis "are looked at as price moderates, but even the moderate position in OPEC looks for $21 a barrel," Mr. Steel said.
Gasoline futures were further supported by reports of a fire at a Citgo Petroleum Corporation refinery in Lake Charles, La. The fire began late Sunday and burned itself out early yesterday.
Silver futures rose sharply on the Commodity Exchange in New York, extending a rally that has raised the spot price by more than 29 cents an ounce, or about 8 percent, since last Tuesday. Analysts said the buying partly reflected a belief that the war's end could speed an economic recovery in the United States, stimulating silver demand from industry.
 
Strike Helps Silver
 John Jonat, metals analyst with Deak International Inc. in New York, said the market also drew support from a strike at Mexico's Penoules smelting operation.
Silver futures settled 8.2 cents to 10.5 cents higher, with March at $3.856 an ounce; gold was 90 cents to $1 higher, with April at $369.50 an ounce.
Grain and soybean futures rose modestly on the Chicago Board of Trade, extending to three days a rally linked to poor crop weather for southern Brazilian soybeans and American winter wheat.
Wheat futures were unchanged to 3 cents higher, with March at $2.71 a bushel. Corn was 1/4 cent to 2 cents higher, with March at $2.46 a bushel Oats were 2 1/2 cents to 3 3/4 cents higher, with March at $1.19 1/4 a bushel, and soybeans were 2 cents to 5 3/4 cents higher, with March at $5.90 1/4 a bushel.
Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting continued strength in the cash cattle market and weakness in cash hogs, combined with expectations that pork futures were due for a break after a strong rally last week.

HEADLINE: Democrats to President: Focus on Issues at Home

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
After months as bystanders while President Bush led the country to war, the Senate and House Democratic leaders struggled today to shift some attention back to Congress, domestic affairs and partisan politics.
In separate addresses before a legislative conference of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, the Senate Democratic leader, George J. Mitchell, and the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, praised Mr. Bush for his leadership in the Persian Gulf crisis. But in the euphoria over the victory abroad, they said, it is no time to neglect pressing social problems at home. 
 The speeches were a preview of the careful balancing act facing Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Foley in the coming days: they want to show initiative among Democrats but they do not want to be accused of attacking a President whose popularity has soared to a historic high point. Conceding the wide bipartisan support for Mr. Bush's handling of the gulf crisis, the Democratic leaders have invited him to address a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night.
Mr. Foley opened his address this morning by commending the President and the American military for "a brillant military success." But after taking note of a new "national pride," the Washington Democrat turned to domestic matters.
"We have problems here at home that are dramatic in a long-term sense, are conclusive and defining in a long-term sense, though not with the intensity or the focus of this recent war," the House Speaker said. "But if we ignore our problems at home, if we ignore the failings of our own system in this country -- economic, political, educational and health -- we will be inviting a time in the next century when the United States will simply not have the capacity, will not have the power, to lead the world to an undertaking such as the Desert Storm or Desert Shield operation."
Appearing later before the same friendly audience of leading union officials, Senator Mitchell was more overtly partisan, and not as effusive in his praise for the Administration. While he said Mr. Bush and his military advisers "deserve credit for the success" in the Persian Gulf, the Maine Democrat wasted no time in reciting a litany of what he views as the Administration's domestic vulnerabilities.
"In the wake of the war, the President says he seeks a new world order," Mr. Mitchell said. "We say, Join us in putting our own house in order. Our first priority must be the American people and economic growth and jobs in the United States."
The Senator condemned Mr. Bush's energy policy as "no policy at all," and dismissed Mr. Bush's recent proposal on block grants for cities and states as "ill-advised." And he vowed to champion passage of family leave and civil rights bills. Both measures were vetoed last year.
The Democratic leaders said that while the United States should play a leading diplomatic role in seeking to resolve lingering troubles in the Middle East, they were more concerned with rebuilding American cities than with rebuilding Kuwait or Iraq.
"It is not appropriate for the United States or United States taxpayers to be called upon to pay any of the cost of rebuilding of this region," Mr. Foley said, prompting applause from union leaders.
Senator Mitchell sounded a similar theme. "But what about American cities?" he asked. "They haven't been bombed. People haven't been tortured. But in many respects, there is devastation in American cities -- economic devastation, psychological devastation, the loss of jobs, the loss of hope, the loss of opportunity. We've got to restore that."
Mr. Foley dwelled on a need for improvements in secondary and higher education so that students can lead the nation into the next century with the ability to "make a military achievement such as Desert Storm possible."
Unlike Senator Mitchell, the Speaker sought to give Congress a bit of credit for the military victory.
Neglecting to mention that he and two-thirds of the Democrats voted in January against using military force in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Foley told the group: "From the time the President made the decision to send forces to the gulf in August of 1990, there was strong bipartisan support for that decision. There was no significant opposition in the Congress or in the country to his determination to defend Saudi Arabia and to redeem Kuwait and to expell Saddam Hussein from Kuwait."

HEADLINE: Bloomfield Hills Journal;
'Recession' Means Someone Else's

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich.

 BODY:
In this wealthy enclave 20 miles from the desperate ghettos of Detroit, local celebrities live on forested estates, chic women in shearling and mink casually drop $4,000 on, say, a belt, and the word "recession" is a minor annoyance, a faint description of somebody else's world.
So while people on the coasts anguish over their faltering economies and even as a new Michigan Governor searches for ways to cut a thin budget, it is more or less spending as usual in this privileged suburb. 
 People are building their 12-bedroom mansions, buying their Ferraris and $4,600 crocodile totebags, racing to the fashion shows to order $2,800 pantsuits and flying first-class to Aspen for the weekend.
To read a recent issue of the local daily newspaper, The Eccentric, one would never know there was economic turmoil in this hemisphere. One story told readers about the latest features on a luxury cruise ship and a headline urged them to "forget winter's blahs, think summer camp."
Bloomfield Hills has never been known for its austerity. While the older, courtlier suburbs east of Detroit, the Grosse Pointes, are a picture of studied restraint, Bloomfield Hills to the north is new money and proud to show it, as perhaps best embodied by a onetime resident, John Z. DeLorean. Bloomfield Hills is now home to Lee Iacocca, Roger Smith, Aretha Franklin, Isiah Thomas and just about anybody else from Detroit who has come into money in the last quarter-century.
These are people who can buy what they want, say the jewelers and boutique owners and interior designers who make their living by catering to the new rich and famous. "The people who've had money still got money and are still spending money," said Terry Mullen, a dealer of luxury import cars in nearby Birmingham.
So despite a recession and layoffs looming in the American automobile industry, Mr. Mullen recently sold a used Ferarri Testarossa for $170,000 to a Bloomfield Hills man who found that his BMW and Mercedes-Benz were simply not enough.
This is not to say that residents here are insensitive to the times. Mr. Mullen has been noticing that some are showing a bit of pragmatism by buying a second Mercedes, a convertible, maybe, instead of a Lamborghini. "Some of them are going for the stuff they can actually drive -- Porsche 911's, Mercedeses, BMW's," he said. "Ma and pa stuff. But of course, ma and pa make $200,000 apiece."
From Bloomfield and the rest of Oakland County, a regional center for research and technology companies, the world looks rosy indeed. In December, the county's unemployment rate fell below 5 percent, to 4.9 percent, for the first time since 1978.
Michigan businesses learned bitter lessons from the devastating recession of 1982, when the unemployment rate in Oakland County reached double digits. That recession, economists say, sifted out the weaker companies.
In the past decade, Oakland County has been the source of 60 percent of all new nongovernment jobs in the state, and Bloomfield Hills and Oakland County consistently rank among the richest in the country.
"We don't bend metal," said Joseph D. Joachim, the deputy county executive. "We're becoming a brain center. We've yet to experience a recession with this kind of mix."
People here prefer not to think about the "R-word." "I won't even allow the word to be said in our company," said Janet Sparks, a Bloomfield resident who heads her own secretarial services concern. "It allows people to make excuses for not performing."
Still, in these days when thousands of auto workers are destined to spend more time on the unemployment line than the assembly line, the captains of industry are being careful not to look as if they are enjoying themselves too much.
"People are more publicly discreet," said Ed Rondina, a hair stylist who has been primping the manes of Michigan's wealthiest women for 13 years. "The automotive high executive wives are tending to repeat outfits now when otherwise they would't wear the same thing twice."
At Adaria, a newly expanded boutique where a suit could pay an average family's mortgage through August and where $2,000 alligator purses are the big movers, business is as brisk as usual, its owner, Anne Dinon, said.
If there is a recession in the auto industry, Chris Long, a Bloomfield Hills architect, says he cannot feel it. "They are absolutely still spending money." Mr. Long said. "After several good years, the auto company executives are spending the fruits of their labor."
Nor have people here lost their zeal for travel. "We're going crazy right now," said Sharon Friedman, an Oakland County travel agent. "We've got tons of people going to Aspen, and they're paying top dollar."
So it is mostly business as usual along the leafy boulevards here, where women pay Mr. Rondina $75 a day to stop by their homes to brush out their hair. "They are still conspicuous spenders," he said. "They feel confident because they know they can ride it out. After all, they rode out the last recession and became more prosperous than they were before."

HEADLINE: Fed to Fight Part of Plan On Banks

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan and other top officials of the Federal Reserve Board are strongly opposed to the part of the Bush Administration's proposed banking legislation that would remove some of the nation's largestbanks from the central bank's supervision.
The Fed's opposition is likely to doom this aspect of the legislation. Insistence by the Treasury Department that the provisions be retained could delay Congressional approval, or even reduce the likelihood of approval, of more fundamental elements of the broad package that the Administration, the Federal Reserve and many private economists say would modernize an anachronistic banking system. 
 Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and his colleagues insist that the Fed could not properly conduct monetary policy or respond adequately to crises like a crash of the financial markets without the detailed understanding of large banks that comes from direct supervision of their lending and other activities.
 
A Matter of Responsibility
 Mr. Greenspan, the other Federal Reserve governors and top staff regulators would not discuss the matter for attribution because, they said, they have not yet presented their case to Congress. But one senior official, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition that he was not identified, said: "Ultimately, the Fed is responsible for the nation's financial system. We can't have that responsibility without the input that comes from direct contact with the biggest banks."
The Administration argues, to the contrary, that the central bank must relinquish some regulatory authority in the interest of simplifying an unwieldy structure in which three Federal agencies -- the Fed, the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- are involved in bank supervision.
"What we do now is overlapping, confusing and not responsive, and is badly in need of simplification," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said in an interview today.
Another top Treasury official said, "The Fed would get all the information it needs from the other regulators."
President Bush has said the banking measure is his top domestic legislative priority for this year. The main aspects of the proposal would eliminate barriers to interstate banking and permit commercial and investment banks to merge. The plan would also allow industrial companies to own banks.
But the battle over supervisory authority is an example of how, just four weeks after Mr. Brady announced the proposal, the initiative may be foundering.
 
Formal Proposal Is Delayed
 To the disappointment of the leaders of the Banking Committees in Congress, the Treasury has still not submitted the legislation it wants considered. Mr. Brady told the lawmakers in hearings last week that the delay was a result of the difficulty of drafting such a long and complicated document.
Many lawmakers of both parties also said they were upset that the Administration had so far refused to take a position on how to replenish the bank insurance fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and protects bank deposits up to $100,000.
By some estimates, enough banks will fail this year to cause the fund to run dry, and officials and politicians agree that new money must be found this year. But raising that money is bound to be politically unpopular, and the Administration apparently wants to avoid as much responsibility or blame as possible.
 
A Mixed Reception
 In two days of hearings before the Senate and House Banking Committees last week, much support was heard for allowing banks to open branches nationwide. But considerable opposition was expressed to allowing banks to enter new lines of business, and there was little enthusiasm for allowing commercial companies to buy banks.
Robert D. Reischauer, who is director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief staff economist, said in an interview that he plans to testify on Tuesday that he is "sympathetic to interstate banking and lukewarm about giving banks increased powers." He also said he sees "no persuasive evidence why allowing commercial firms to own banks would improve the situation."
On the question of supervisory authority, Mr. Reischauer said that he favored simplified regulation but that it was "not at all clear that the Administration proposal represents a marked improvement over what we have now."
 
State and Federal Charters
 Under current law, the Fed regulates all bank holding companies; more than 90 percent of the nation's bank assets are in banks that are part of holding companies. The Administration proposes to continue to let the Fed supervise holding companies in which the principal bank is state-chartered, but to allow a new agency within the Treasury Department to supervise those in which the main bank is federally chartered.
Some of the largest banks owned by holding companies are federally chartered, including Citibank, Chase Manhattan, First National Bank of Chicago, Security Pacific and BankAmerica. Among those that are state-chartered are Manufacturers Hanover, Chemical, the Bank of New York, Bankers Trust and Morgan Guaranty.
Many senators and representatives view the fight over which agencies should supervise which banks to be little more than a bureaucratic turf struggle, but officials at the Fed and the Treasury say it is more important than that.
"Some might suggest that my position is motivated by nothing more than bureaucratic turf," E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a recent speech. "But it is not; it is my utter conviction based on my view of the very essence of central banking."
Mr. Brady, on the other hand, said, "You're supposed to say and do what you think is right for the country regardless of the turf fights." He added that he thought it was crucial to have bank regulation "in the political realm" rather than largely at the Fed, which is independent.

HEADLINE: A County With Much at Stake Is Wary of Weicker Tax Plan

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn.

 BODY:
The anxiety and uncertainty that has gripped much of Connecticut since Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. announced his plan to tax wages has found its focal point here in Fairfield County, the seat of the state's greatest wealth.
From the horse paddocks of back-country Greenwich to the corporate office parks of Stamford, Fairfield and Danbury -- home to more Fortune 500 corporations than any place in the United States after New York and Chicago -- Mr. Weicker's plan has raised questions about the region's future and its identity. There is widespread concern over how the tax plan would affect individuals here, and whether the changes would disrupt the economy and make the area less desirable for corporations. 
 Among the mysteries is the question of just how much wealth would be tapped by Mr. Weicker's proposed 6 percent tax on family income over $25,000. Because Connecticut has had no income tax except on dividends, interest and capital gains, and because the Internal Revenue Service only compiles statewide figures, no one is really sure how rich the rich here really are, or even how much they pay in taxes now.
Connecticut, one of only 10 states with no broad-based personal income tax, has financed state government mainly through sales and corporation taxes. The Weicker plan would lower those in an effort to stimulate the economy and would make up the gap with the new income tax.
 
Pockets of High Income
 There are only glimmers of information about what might turn up on the new tax form: New York State officials, for example, say that the average commuter from Connecticut was paid about $63,000 in 1987, or three times as much as the average commuter from Pennsylvania.
A study several years ago found that 40 percent of the taxes on stock dividends and capital-gains earnings in Connecticut were collected in just eight lower Fairfield County towns. When one Greenwich millionaire, whose name remains a mystery, died last year, the inheritance tax paid to Connecticut was $52.7 million.
The United States Department of Commerce ranked Fairfield as the ninth wealthiest county in the nation in 1988, with a per capita income of $29,084. Connecticut's statewide average was $23,033, highest in the nation.
But residents and politicians here, some of whom report an almost hysterical reaction against the income tax, say the implications of Mr. Weicker's plan go far beyond the pocketbook.
"Upstate the income tax is opposed, but it's recognized as a meaningful option," said Senator George Jepsen, a Democrat from Stamford, who said he intended to oppose the plan. "Downstate it's just absolute, and frequently emotional, opposition."
 
A Separate Identity
 Fairfield County, with a heavy concentration of Republicans and commuters who work in New York, has long felt itself alien to the rest of the state and to the state government, which has been run by Democrats for most of the last 40 years. And Mr. Weicker, a former Greenwich Republican who abandoned his party last year to run as a third-party independent, lost badly in the county.
The county gets less state aid in such areas as education than less affluent areas of the state receive. The local economy is also far less tied to the engine of state spending than is the economy around Hartford.
Mr. Weicker argues that the income tax would resolve a $2.4 billion gap in state revenues and stimulate the sagging economy at the same time by allowing tax cuts to businesses. More than a few residents here don't see the connection.
K. Ross Hughes, a retired paper-company executive from Greenwich, spoke for many Fairfield residents when he said, "It's going to kill the economy of this area -- that's about all I can say."
There is, however, some support for the plan. State Senator William H. Nickerson, a Republican from Greenwich, said that fully a third of his mail favors the Weicker proposals, mostly because of the proposed reduction in dividend taxes.
 
Measuring the Effects
 State officials say that while some Fairfield residents would see a sharp increase in their taxes, a greater proportion of residents in Fairfield County would find their taxes staying the same or reduced under Mr. Weicker's plan than in any other part of the state.
The Weicker proposal would lower the tax on corporate profits, for example -- now the highest in the nation at 13.8 percent -- to 11.5 percent. The 8 percent sales tax, the highest statewide rate in the nation, would be lowered to 4.25 percent. Taxes on dividends and interest, also the highest in the nation at 14 percent for incomes above $100,000, would be treated the same as wages and taxed at 6 percent. The capital-gains tax, on profits from the sale of investments like real estate and stocks, would be lowered to 6 percent from the current 7 percent.
The large number of Fairfield County residents who commute to work in New York already pay income taxes there. Such commuters would continue to pay income taxes where they work, and those taxes would effectively cancel out their income-tax liability in Connecticut.
The reductions in taxes on dividends, interest and capital gains would be likely to benefit Fairfield residents the most, since so much investment income is concentrated in the county.
"It's a real hard call, but I think we should give him a chance," Jan McCurry, a bank loan officer who works in Greenwich, said of Mr. Weicker. "I would like to see the wealthier segment pay a little bit more."
 
Climate for Businesses
 One of the biggest concerns of Fairfield County residents and officials is whether the Weicker plan would make the area less desirable for corporations. They say the county's successful combination of lower taxes and an attractive quality of life could be thrown out of balance.
For the commercial real-estate lenders and builders who have created an industry out of wooing major corporations from New York City, anxieties about the tax plan have been heightened by the recession. Eve without an income tax, it has been five years since the last Fortune 500 company moved here.
Morgan Stanley, the investment banking house, is considered by many to be a test case for the Weicker plan. The company, now based in Manhattan, is considering a move to Stamford that would be the biggest corporate relocation ever for this state. Up to 4,200 employees would be moved and 1.2 million square feet of new office space would be built.
"There's no question that it's going to hurt competitiveness," Dennis J. Donovan, a senior vice president at Moran Stahl & Boyer, a consulting firm that specializes in business relocation, said of the tax plan.
But Mr. Donovan said that if some of the new tax money were used to address other problems that have already diminished the area's appeal -- especially traffic congestion -- the advantages and disadvantages would probably equal out.
Theodore F. Brophy, retired chairman of the GTE Corporation, which was one of the first major companies to relocate from New York in 1970, said in an interview that Connecticut's periodic fiscal crises and high corporation taxes have already made it "less attractive as a place to be than when GTE moved up here."
But, he added, everything is relative. "I would guess," Mr. Brophy said, "that New York is also less attractive than it was."

HEADLINE: Campeau Units Report Losses

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CINCINNATI, March 4

 BODY:
The Campeau Corporation's two department store subsidiaries -- the Allied Stores Corporation and Federated Department Stores -- today reported losses in January and said they expected the slow economy would continue to hurt results in the near term.
The department stores, which are operating under protection of United States bankruptcy laws, said in a statement that "consumer activity was weaker than expected in January, reflecting the impact of the war and the continuing recession."
Federated reported a loss of $69 million for the four weeks that ended on Feb. 2. That compared with a profit of $51 million in the five weeks that ended on Jan. 5. Sales fell to $211 million from $772 million.
Allied Stores said it had a loss in January of $55 million, compared with a December profit of $23.4 million. Sales tumbled to $127 million, from $414 million in the five weeks that ended on Jan. 5.

HEADLINE: Tough Choice for New York: Pay Debt Cost or Halt Repairs

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Prices of Manhattan apartments may be soft and the city's bridges may be crumbling, but in one category, at least, New York remains on top: It piles on more long-term debt in most years than any borrower other than the United States Government.
In the 1970's the city's burden of debt was a symptom of its financial woes -- borrowing to mask poor fiscal management and to pay operating expenses. But today's heavy borrowing has a concrete purpose, literally. It is for rebuilding the city. 
 The city's ferocious appetite for debt stems largely from a decision made in 1988 by the Koch administration to accelerate sharply its spending on infrastructure, like roads, bridges and the maintenance of city school buildings.
The city's Office of Management and Budget has estimated that even if the capital budgets of Houston, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles -- whose total population is 30 percent more than New York City's -- were all rolled into one, that would still equal only 55 percent of New York City's capital program in its 1992 fiscal year. That point is not diminished even if spending by the county governments of those other cities is included.
 
'Uncharted Waters'
 While most residents applauded the decision to rebuild, the cost of financing this program has now led the city, in its fiscal straits, to an agonizing policy choice: whether it can afford the cost and depressing economic effects now of servicing that debt versus whether it can afford not to fix school buildings, bridges and roadways.
The $22.4 billion in debt the city already has on its books will require it to devote 75 cents of every new dollar of revenue raised this year to meeting interest and principal payments. And over the next four years, the city has plans to issue $17.8 billion more in long-term bonds.
"We're in uncharted waters," said one city official. "Nobody has ever tried to issue this much debt before." The State of California comes the closest, but, as financial experts point out, its economy is many times the size of New York City's, and California enjoys a triple-A rating, which makes its bonds more attractive to investors.
The administration of Mayor Edward I. Koch planned to pay for much of that capital investment program with borrowed money. And since the mid-1980's the city has chosen to defer repaying some of its debt and instead to roll it over into the future. The result of these decisions is that debt service payments are higher now, when the city is in a recession, than they were during the boom years of the 1980's, when the city's tax base increased by 50 percent. Mr. Koch makes no apologies for his decision to increase capital spending but says the city must now cut back, given its financial condition.
 
A Bulge in Payments
 Over the next three fiscal years, just as the city is trying to help spark a recovery, it faces a bulge in interest and principal payments that could force it to curtail its spending on infrastructure. Such cutbacks, debt analysts said, would depress construction activity and dampen any nascent recovery.
The administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins has already responded to the city's mounting debt problems by paring the city's capital commitment program by $2.3 billion over the next four years, a step that reduced borrowing costs by $1.4 billion. But officials say that may not be enough.
"We will probably need to evaluate it again before May," said City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman. The city's final report on its 10-year capital strategy is due in May.
The possibility of another round of cuts in the city's capital spending has already set off a fierce debate within various agencies over the city's future. While some city officials worry that New York cannot sustain its huge borrowing program because the marketplace cannot absorb that many bonds, others say the alternative -- sharp cutbacks in spending on infrastructure -- could so damage the city's roads and bridges that it would undermine the city's long-term future.
What everyone does seem to agree on is that the city's debt load is rapidly becoming an important policy issue. It began creeping up in size in the mid-1980's, but New York City and the Municipal Assistance Corporation rose to the top of the debt rankings in 1986 and have remained there since, except for last year, when it was surpassed by the New York State Dormitory Authority. The city's anticipated $4 billion-a-year borrowing program assures it its place on top for the next few years.
In the next fiscal year alone, debt service payments are due to rise by $962 million, or an amount equal to around half of the city's forecasted budget deficit of more than $2 billion. Paradoxically, nearly a third of that increase is due to payments on debt issued by the M.A.C. in the 1970's to help pull the city out of its last economic crisis.
 
Major Element of Gaps
 "The sharp rise in debt service is clearly the major element of the huge budget gaps confronting the city," the office of the State Deputy Comptroller for New York City warned last November in a report on the city's economy.
Debt service payments, it is estimated, will consume more than 11 percent of the city's revenues by 1994, up from 6.3 percent last year. And even that forecast may prove to be optimistic if income-tax and property-tax revenues continue to fall short of expectations, as they have recently. In the mid-1970's, when the city was mired in a debt crisis, debt service consumed about 15 percent of the city's budget.
There are a number of steps that the Dinkins administration could take to reduce the impact on the budget and the economy of the city's looming debt load. It could refinance some of that debt, stretching the interest payments over a longer time period. But when that idea was broached recently by Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the state's Municipal Assistance Corporation, which monitors the city's finances, the proposal was quickly dismissed by city officials as fiscally irresponsible and it has garnered little political support since then.
 
A Quirk With Implications
 Another option is to increase the market for the city's bonds by diversifying the name under which they are issued. Unlike many other states and municipalities, New York has issued the bulk of its debt under the city's name instead of, say, a city housing agency or a transportation authority. Though largely a historical quirk, that has important financial and political implications.
Most mutual funds, which are the largest buyers of the city's bonds, have internal guidelines that prohibit them from investing more than 5 percent of their portfolios in the bonds of any one issuer. And since New York City has been issuing so many billions of bonds under one name for so many years, and has plans to continue doing so, some funds may soon approach that limit.
Gary Swayze, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments, said two of its mutual funds that buy New York City bonds are about a third of the way toward their 5 percent ceiling on these bonds.
Although investor demand for New York bonds has been strong so far, Dinkins administration officials and debt analysts are not sure how long the financial markets can continue to absorb quarterly bond offerings of $1 billion or more, particularly if the city's economic climate continues to deteriorate and there is further downgrading of the city's debt rating.
 
'Sheer Volume'
 In its most recent $1 billion bond offering, the city ended up paying an interest rate about 1 percentage point higher than comparable municipal borrowers. Mr. Swayze of Fidelity attributed that higher rate to "the sheer volume of issuance rather than credit quality."
Maintaining access to the bond markets is a particularly sensitive issue at City Hall, for even the "substantial likelihood" that access might be lost could trigger the intervention of the State Financial Control Board.
The Dinkins administration is working hard to design new borrowing entities that would finance equipment the city buys each year and the renovation of two hospitals. But even if the city was successful in creating these new programs, it would reduce its $4 billion-a-year borrowing plan by only $500 million a year.
The more the city decentralizes its borrowing authority, the more far-reaching the policy repercussions will be. To convince investors that the new entities are truly independent, they have to have their own earmarked source of revenues. And that could lead to an increase in user fees for city services that were previously paid out of general revenues.
 
Charging for Water
 In 1986, for instance, the city established the Municipal Water Authority, which has since issued $3.24 billion of bonds under its own name. Money to pay the interest and principal on that debt comes from new user fees that are being charged on water as a result of the city's recent efforts to install meters throughout the city. The authority's rate consultant has estimated that water and sewer rates will have to rise 18.3 percent in the next fiscal year and 18.9 percent the next year to cover expenses, which include debt service.
In addition to the likelihood of more "revenue enhancement" measures, a decentralization of the city's borrowing authority could have longer-term implications for the way the city is run.
If the city's borrowing is divided among a host of new authorities, however, it will be the appointed officials who run those entities and decide how their financial resources should be used. Just as city officials and assistance corporation officials have frequently disagreed over how M.A.C. surpluses should be used, the existence of a host of other borrowing authorities could slowly devolve decision-making power away from elected officials and into the hands of other appointees.

And Now, a Commission on S.& L.'s

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 4

 BODY:
Hundreds of articles, scores of scholarly papers and more than a dozen full-length books have been written in the last two years alone on the causes of the savings and loan mess.
But they were not authoritative enough for Congress. On the night of Saturday, Oct. 27, just before adjournment of the 101st Congress, without a recorded vote and almost unnoticed in the press, the lawmakers established a commission to study the savings and loan issue: the National Commission on Financial Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement. 
 At a cost of $1 million, the commission will take its place beside the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, the Ukraine Famine Commission and who knows how many other panels that have been set up because Congress wanted to do something and did not know what.
Nothing much has happened since the law was passed. The commission is supposed to have eight private citizens as members: two appointed by the President, two by the Senate Democratic leadership, two by the House Democratic leadership and one each by the Senate and House Republican leadership. None have been named yet, and the $1 million has not been appropriated.
"What with the war and everything else, people have been busy, and this has not been on a fast track," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who was the House sponsor.
Still, a law is a law. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said last week that he had submitted the names of potential commission members to the White House. The Congressional leaders said they were working on it. (House Speaker Thomas S. Foley has a staff assistant whose full-time job is to find people for the slots on more than 150 commissions and boards he is responsible for filling.)
Sooner or later the panel members will be appointed, the money will be allocated, a staff will be formed and office space will be found.
After nine months, the life span of the panel set by the law, the commissioners will call a news conference and distribute a thick report. The findings are entirely predictable.
In brief, economic circumstances in the late 1970's and early 1980's, particularly unusually high interest rates, made the savings and loans unprofitable. They were saddled with long-term, low-interest mortgage loans at a time when they were forced to pay high rates to depositors.
To keep them in business, Congress, which was unusually tight with some of the lobbyists and operators, changed the rules and permitted savings and loans to get into risky areas like commercial real estate and junk bonds.
Meanwhile, the state and Federal regulatory agencies were understaffed and ill-equipped. The Reagan Administration preferred not to intervene in unpleasant economic problems, saying the free market should be allowed to take its course.
But free-market principles did not apply. Federal deposit insurance meant that the Government and not the operators of the savings and loans bore most of the financial risk. So when speculative deals went sour, sometimes because of incompetence and sometimes because of corruption, the taxpayers were left holding the bag, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars.
In other words, there is plenty of blame to go around.
Administration officials say they will cooperate with the commission, though they see it as a pain in the neck. "It's going to take an enormous amount of everyone's time, collecting documents and preparing testimony, and in the end they're just going to come up with what everyone already knows," said one official.
So why yet another commission? Surely, the lawmakers would have accomplished more and earned more political credit if they had used the $1 million, say, to hire more clerks at understaffed unemployment offices.
Mr. Schumer and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, one of the chief Senate sponsors, say their primary motive was to get an authoritative report that would persuade their colleagues that allowing banks to enter new businesses would not run the risk of another savings and loan disaster.
But even the sponsors' enthusiasm seems to have waned. "I don't consider it to be one of my monumental legislative accomplishments," said Senator Dodd.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
New Loans To Chrysler Called Near

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 4

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation has reached a tentative accord with its banks that if approved would give the company a financial cushion until its depressed sales and profits improve, financial executives who spoke with Chrysler officials said today.
Chrysler has been unable to comply with some conditions of its existing $2.6 billion revolving line of credit, which expires in 1993. Under terms of the tentative agreement, those loans would be replaced by $1.7 billion in new loans with different terms. 
 Chrysler executives met Friday at the company's headquarters in Highland Park, Mich., near Detroit, with a consortium of 38 banks led by the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company. The New York-based financial executives said an agreement could be made final within two weeks.
Chrysler asked the banks to reorganize its existing agreement because it could not comply with some of the covenants, or terms, of the loan since its balance sheet had deteriorated in recent months, the sources said.
 
Sensitive Negotiations
 The executives, who consult regularly with Chrysler financial managers, agreed to speak only on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations.
Chrysler posted a small profit for the fourth quarter of 1990, but it has said that it expects a large loss in the current quarter, which ends on March 31. The company said last week that it was reducing its salaried work force by about 3,000 employees.
Recent reductions in the quality ratings of Chrysler's debt securities to "junk bond" status have made it too expensive for the company to borrow in the public debt markets. Hence, Chrysler's cash flow has been strained and the company has accelerated cost-cutting moves intended to conserve its cash at a time of slow vehicle sales.
Under terms of the tentative agreement, the executives said, about 40 percent of the $1.7 billion would be restricted for use by Chrysler's finance subsidiary, which makes auto loans and does other types of lending. The rest of the amount, about $1 billion, could be drawn by the corporate parent to pay operating expenses or to develop new models.
Telephone requests seeking comment from the lenders working with Chrysler were not returned. Chrysler aknowledged that it had talked with bankers, but said it had not reached a definitive agreement.
It was not immediately clear when the loan agreement would expire or what terms would apply to the loan.
Covenants are conditions of a loan agreement that require the borrower to maintain a certain level of financial health, as measured by various ratios of its capital and profit compared with its debts and obligations. In the event that the borrower fails to meet the terms of the covenants, the lender can usually cut off credit or declare that the loans must be paid immediately.
Chrysler has not earned strong profits for more than two years, eroding its financial cushion and the amount it can spend to develop new vehicles. But the auto maker's executives have been saying that they will introduce a new Jeep model and a new midsize car next year that they expect will help profits. Moreover, they think the entire vehicle market will recover strongly.
Chrysler directors are scheduled to vote on Thursday in New York on the future of the company's 30-cent quarterly dividend, which most automotive analysts predict will be cut or omitted. Dropping the dividend would save $60 million a quarter.
Lee A. Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, had once said that Chrysler would continue to pay its dividend "short of a nuclear war." But he backed off from that position recently as the company's financial condition continued to deteriorate.
Chrysler's bankers last year agreed to extend up to $2.6 billion in unsecured credit to the No. 3 American auto maker. The terms of the accord obligated the banks to lend Chrysler the money unless it underwent an important change in financial condition.
 
Change in Condition
 Under the agreement, the reduction in the company's debt ratings by itself changed the company's financial condition. And banks have generally become more wary of unsecured loans in recent months because of the weakness of the economy and concern about the financial condition of the nation's banks.
But when Chrysler reported its fourth-quarter profit of $31 million on Feb. 7, Robert S. Miller, the company's vice chairman, said, "I do not anticipate some big fistfight" with the bankers over an extension of credit.
Still, Chrysler is expected to write off $257 million in the current quarter, which will directly reduce the company's profit, because it has adopted a more conservative method of accounting for customer rebates and low-interest financing.

HEADLINE: Computers Gain New Respect as Translators

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AFTER years of limited progress and effort, there is now a renaissance of interest in using computers to translate languages. Scientists believe that with the help of more powerful computers, advances in artificial intelligence and new approaches to translation, the long-sought goal of machine translation may be at hand.
Researchers once believed machine translation would be a relatively simple task of having computers match words in dictionaries and apply a few rules of grammar. But different concepts among languages, varying uses of parts of speech, idioms, nuance, contextual meanings, sentence structure and other factors proved daunting. 
 For example, the sentence "The hunters shot at the ducks and I saw several fall" is immediately comprehensible to all speakers of English, but can pose a vexing conundrum for a computer trying to determine whether it was the hunters or the ducks that fell.
Likewise, the declarative statement "I can fish" could easily be translated, "I work in a cannery."
The initial brute-force approach of using powerful computers containing large dictionaries, syntax rules and powerful mathematical methods to solve problems, or algorithms, did not fade away entirely. Several commercial companies, including Systran Translation Systems Inc. of La Jolla, Calif., continued to refine such systems and now claim 85 percent or better accuracy in translating specialized documents into several languages.
"Systran proved that machine translation could be done and that there was a market for rudimentary translation," said Dr. Yorick Wilks, head of the Computing Research Laboratory at New Mexico State University. "The translations are rough, but useful. However, they require human translators to do pre-editing and post-editing to deal with ambiguities and to create a first-rate finished product."
One promising alternative to the brute force approach lies in the analysis of meaning. Methods are being developed that infer meaning by the context in which a word is used, said Dr. Jaime G. Carbonell, director of the Center for Machine Translation at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
Using artificial intelligence techniques that simulate human thinking, it should be possible to organize semantic information in a hierarchical fashion so that the computer can pick the most likely meaning from a list of abstract possibilities, he said. In translating "I took the cake from the table and ate it," for example, a computer could tell that "ate" referred to cake and not table by knowing that something you eat has to be edible.
"By using semantic information, you can infuse the system with a degree of common sense it didn't have before when you used only syntax and word order," Dr. Carbonell said.
Another approach receiving considerable attention is the use of "unified grammars" or "interlinguas" that contain common grammar concepts and universal meanings. Using this approach, all languages are considered modules or spokes of a wheel that address a hub, which contains a common, central set of meanings -- kind of an Esperanto for machine translation -- before being translated into one another.
The interlingual approach should simplify translation by having a central, intermediate "language" in which all terms or concepts have only one meaning for any sense in which they are used in the tongue being translated. The intent is to avoid the passion of poets but the pitfall of translators: ambiguity.
For instance, the English word "bank" can mean, among other things, a financial institution, the land bordering a river or creek, a mound or heap of something, or, as an aviation verb, the turn of an airplane. In an interlingua, each would have a separate representation or code.
The Tradux Corporation of Pompano Beach, Fla., has begun marketing an interlingual system, called Ultra, that was developed by the Wilks group at New Mexico State. Robert P. Irwin, the company president, said the program's English, Spanish, German, Japanese and Chinese language modules have dictionaries designed for simple business correspondence. Each contains only 10,000 meanings because the interlingual approach allows for greater simplicity while producing highly accurate translations with only minimal editing.
 
The Simpler, the Better
 "If you want to add a language, all you have to do is develop a module and not a whole new program with a different set of rules for that language relating to each of the others," Mr. Irwin said.
Interlingual programs now require mainframe or work-station computer power. But Toltran Ltd. of Barrington, Ill., has developed a new translation system for personal computers. It analyzes the base meanings of words without prefixes or suffixes, and the structure of words to tell their parts of speech, tense and semantic traits, such as their relationships to other words in phrases.
"The simpler the system, the better," said Bruce G. Tolin, the author of the program, who contends that his method exploits commonalities in words from different languages that others have not noticed.
Computer translation work almost came to a halt in the United States after an influential 1966 study by the National Academy of Sciences recommended that research in the area be curtailed. The report said there was little hope that computer approaches of that day would produce systems that could match the cost and quality of human translators.
After more than 20 years of almost no Federal support for computer translation, at least by civilian agencies, Government money is beginning to filter back into the field. Financing from the National Science Foundation has risen to about $400,000 annually to support three small university machine translation projects. And the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is expected to announce a new $1 million a year cooperative program involving New Mexico State, Carnegie-Mellon and the University of Southern California to develop the interlingual approach further.
Dr. Carbonell of Carnegie-Mellon said that the technology for computer language translation was ready and that it was more economically necessary than it was 25 years ago.
 
European Requirements
 "The research really didn't end," Dr. Carbonell said. "It kind of went underground. There absolutely has been progress, although this is not a guarantee we will be successful."
Dr. Carbonell and others in the language translation area said the current American push was being inspired by the pressure of world trade and an increasing interest in language and international affairs.
The European Economic Community has required that by 1992, those doing business with its member countries must translate product instructions and certain correspondence into its 10 official languages. Increased trade with Japan, Korea and other nations in the Far East is fueling interest in translations.
The effort to use computers to translate language now spans a range of size and sophistication from giant mainframe machines to hand-held devices the size of calculators or credit cards. The small devices, such as those made by Microlytics Inc. and Franklin Electronic Publishers Inc., use advanced data compression technology to put thousands of words and hundreds of phases in several languages at the fingertips. They have more translating power than mainframe computers did 25 years ago.
Alan W. Portela of Systran said it costs about $45 per page for a human translator to translate from one language to another manually, compared with about $20 per page for current machine translation that is later checked by a human. Unedited machine translation directly from one language to another, with less than perfect accuracy, has also proved to be enough for some users.
Thomas F. Seal, president of Alpnet Inc., a Salt Lake City company that uses a computer-aided translation system to assist human translators, said it would probably be 25 years before anyone developed machine translations that approach what humans can do. He and others said they doubted whether any machine would ever be able to handle translations of diplomatic correspondence, classic literature or legal documents.
"Humans in the loop with computers means you can allow for subtlety, nuance and ambiguity in human language that no computer alone can handle," Mr. Seal said. "After years of research in machine translation, which seems to attract interest every five to seven years or so but then goes away when people get dissatisfied with the progress, there have not been any fundamental breakthroughs. If it ever happens, I think it will have to be something radically different."

GRAPHIC: Diagrams: 'Conventional Approach'
 
Many machine translation approaches resemble an 1880's telephone network with each "user," or language, directly wire to every other user for translation purposes. There are so many combinations, valuable computer space is tied up.
 
'A Possible Solution'
 
A newer approach is analogous to a telephone switchboard, with a self-contained intermediate program language that stores material to be translated into any other language. It minimizes storage needs and does not favor any single language. (Source: Toltran Ltd.)

HEADLINE: Fans Mourn Loss of an Interracial Soap Opera

BYLINE: By C. GERALD FRASER

 BODY:
Washed out by low ratings, television's first interracial soap opera devoted to the adventures and misadventures of black and white families, "Generations," has left behind a group of disappointed viewers, many of them black professionals, still yearning to tune in tomorrow.
After broadcasting 407 episodes, NBC took "Generations" off the air at the end of January. It had lasted for 13 months. 
 Describing the serial in 1989, as it was about to go on, the network said that it was "a contemporary daytime drama set in Chicago" and that it centered "on the relationships of two families -- one white, the Whitmores; one black, the Marshalls -- whose lives have been linked for generations."
Now it is gone for good. An NBC spokesman, Rob Maynor, said, "If it doesn't deliver, it doesn't stay on the air."
The cancellation annoyed a number of the show's regular viewers. One New Jersey working couple taped the 30-minute show daily for evening viewing. They were perturbed "on the day of the final segment to find out that most of it was superseded by a war bulletin, leaving a seemingly inexplicable ending and adding insult to injury."
 
'It Was Different'
 The cancellation also upset Marsha Hunt, a Philadelphia novelist. "It was a very good show," she said in a telephone interview. "It was different. The story line was not who's sleeping with whom. It showed a real relationship between the two women."
Ms. Hunt did not rest on her disappointment. "I don't sit back," she said. "When people say blacks don't write in, I'm not one of them. When they say blacks don't call in, I'm not one of them." She wrote, she called and she organized "The Coalition to Save 'Generations.' "
She said she had 12 people in 12 states "running groups" that had sent "around a thousand" save-"Generations" letters to local stations, NBC, prospective syndicators and PBS, which they view as a potential broadcaster of the serial.
Ms. Hunt voiced several complaints, echoed in the letters. One was that the serial had been broadcast in poor time slots. In New York, it came on at 12:30 P.M., opposite the No. 1 soap, "The Young and the Restless." In some cities, Ms. Hunt said, "Generations" came on at 2:30 A.M. She also said that the soap had not been given enough time on the air to develop an audience.
 
Were Ratings Accurate?
 She questioned whether the show's low Nielsen ratings accurately reflected the number of viewers. "There are few Nielsen boxes in homes in minority communities," she said. A Nielsen Media Research vice president, Jack Loftus, said yesterday that 11 percent of households in the Nielsen population sample are black.
Mr. Maynor, the NBC spokesman, said the network had dropped "Generations" "because it didn't get the size of audience we wanted."
"We wanted more than we had," he continued. "It was the lowest-rated soap opera on the air. It had the smallest audience, it didn't deliver for advertisers and it wasn't attractive to affiliates."
Consequently, he said, the network does not intend to revive the show.
 
Creator of the Show
 Sally Sussman, a writer who had received two Emmy award nominations as a member of the writing staff of "The Young and the Restless," created "Generations," serving as both its executive producer and head writer.
In a telephone interview, she said, "I came up with the idea four years ago and sold it to NBC to create the first racially balanced show." She said it had been well received .
"Most shows are given more than two years to find an audience," she said. "The nature of the soap opera business is that it takes two years to find itself and find an audience. The current climate at NBC, in terms of economics, did not lend itself to continuing the show. It was expensive to produce and had a soft advertising market. And they decided to cancel. It was a valid reason from their perspective, but I think it was short-sighted."
In New York, the editor in chief of Soap Opera Weekly, Mimi Torchin, agreed. "It was intelligent and fast moving," she said. "A new show always gets off to a slow start. They're always terrible in the beginning. Until you are in these people's lives, know the background, it's hard to get involved, until you care about them."
The probationary period for most serials is, she agreed, usually two years. For example, she said, NBC dropped "Texas" only after 28 months. She also cited "Loving" and "Santa Barbara" as two long-running soaps that have never achieved high ratings.
Ms. Torchin, speaking of the "Generations" cancellation, said: "Blacks are only 11 percent of the total viewing audience, and there was not enough of a black audience to watch it." She added: "It was known as 'the black soap' in the heartland. There's still a lot of racism and whether it was racism per se, there was resistance."

HEADLINE: World's Film Dealers Converge on Santa Monica

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA MONICA, Calif., March 4

 BODY:
If you want to buy the Korean movie, video and television rights for Kevin Costner's next picture, "Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," the American Film Market here is the place to be. But even if you are interested only in acquiring "Chopper Chicks in Zombietown" for exhibition in Suriname, it still makes sense to put in an appearance.
For everyone except Hollywood's seven major studios, in fact, the American Film Market, which opened on Thursday and continues through Friday, is an unparalleled opportunity to buy and sell movies on the international market. This year, some 2,000 independent movie and video producers and distributors from 59 countries, Argentina to Zimbabwe, are scurrying from one hotel room to another in search of deals. 
 "It's a bazaar here," said Mark Damon, head of Vision International, an American company whose offerings include titles such as "Hard Promises" and "Kickboxer II." He was waiting for several Spanish businessmen in a lavish suite overlooking the Pacific Ocean. "Our people speak French, German, Italian and Spanish, and in an eight-day period, we'll have between 300 and 400 meetings and generally close $25 million to $35 million in sales."
Increasingly, the movies bought and sold at the market consist less of action-adventure and horror films than of glossier upmarket fare of the sort the studios have traditionally produced, such as the Academy Award nominated "Misery" or "The Long Walk Home," which are attracting a lot of attention here. Titles such as "Suburban Commando" or "Housesitter: The Night They Saved Siegfried's Brain" this year account for only 10 percent of the films being offered, down from one-third or more in years past.
To attract buyers, the more than 200 companies participating in the market have continuous showings of promotional reels in their temporary offices and full screenings at nearby theaters. Other lures include gigantic posters, colorful brochure handouts, lifesize cardboard cutouts of bikini-clad starlets and free Continental breakfasts.
 
Bigger Than Cannes
 In the corridors, other buyers and distributors are hoping to strike deals to finance future productions together, which helps explain the presence of the occasional banker in a pinstripe suit. Though tight security is supposed to keep out such interlopers, a few would-be screenwriters and producers without credentials are also around, trying to drum up interest in their projects.
First held in 1981, the American Film Market has grown to become the busiest single motion picture industry trade fair in the world, surpassing even the much better known Cannes International Film Festival. Last year the market reported $362 million in sales of films and services, versus $345 million for Cannes, according to statistics compiled by the American Film Marketing Association, which organizes and hosts the event here.
"For us, the A.F.M. is No. 1," Ahmad Golchin of the Pharco Film Company, which has headquarters in the United Arab Emirates, said as he roamed the seventh floor corridor of Loew's Santa Monica Beach Hotel, where the event is being held. "Cannes is pleasure with business thrown in. The A.F.M. is all business."
Mr. Golchin said he had bought more than 40 films at last year's market and hoped to buy as many this year. His partner, Salim Ramia, said that even for those who may not buy even one movie, the event is useful in scouting coming movie trends, keeping an eye on competitors and pressing the flesh with foreign business partners normally accessible only by phone or fax.
 
Difficult Times
 Despite the large amounts of business being done here, though, these are difficult times for independent movie producers and distributors. Exhibitors at the market say they face international challenges ranging from the imposition of quotas and other possible trade restrictions in the European Community to the apparent saturation of the video market in many countries.
In Western Europe, they complain, the major Hollywood studios are buying up theaters or theater chains and making it difficult for movies other than their own to obtain bookings. With the collapse of Communism, the same process is beginning to happen in East European countries like Hungary, which are experiencing a movie boom now that they suddenly have access to 45 years of Western films.
"The majors have more resources to move in on a quicker basis, and in Eastern Europe they are trying to get into an advantageous position," said William Shields, chairman of the American Film Marketing Association. "The bulk of those theaters are controlled by a few companies, and we have to hope that demand creates supply and there will be a lot of building of new theaters."
<> <>
In addition, distributors fear that the 12 members of the European Community, countries, which will become a single economic entity at the end of next year, will follow through on threats to impose quotas on the entry of American movies, which would drive prices down. But the centralization of the movie business is also being felt by movie buyers, who say they are feeling squeezed too.
 In Asia, where two decades of economic growth have created a growing middle class with a hunger for both movies and video, the principal problem continues to be piracy. Distributors complain that countries such as the Philippines and Thailand make few purchases because the illegal duplication of films is so widespread.
"It is a challenging time," Mr. Shields said. "Business until recently was very good and perhaps too easy. It's gotten a bit tougher and more demanding, and that is going to require everyone's business acumen."

HEADLINE: The President's Popularity

 BODY:
It's a stunning figure: As the Persian Gulf war ended, President Bush's popularity, in a USA Today poll, shot up to 91 percent. That prompted a gleeful Representative Newt Gingrich to say, "The number of people who don't like George Bush is almost down to the number of people running for the Democratic nomination."
A popularity figure of anything like 91 percent surely includes a fair number of fair-weather friends. For instance, only four months ago, the same Representative Gingrich ignited anger in the White House for his harsh denunciation of the President's budget deal with Congress. 
 But even so, 91 percent! With support like that, there's room for many fickle friends to depart and still leave the President a commanding favorite in 1992. The election is now just 20 months away and so far, apart from George McGovern, no Democrats have even declared.
Without denying President Bush an ounce of the pride and credit he has earned in the war, caution is in order. Republican glee is as exaggerated as Democratic gloom. The experience of other Presidents demonstrates a cold truth about such surges of popularity: They don't last.
Whenever Americans confront grave international events, they rally round the flag -- and the President. After the American hostage-taking in Iran, President Carter's popularity as measured by the Gallup Poll initially shot up by 6 and then by 13 points. This is what John Mueller of the University of Rochester defines as a "rally event," and it was already evident in Mr. Bush's poll ratings. In early January, The New York Times/CBS News Poll found his approval rating to be 58 percent. A few days later -- after the air war against Iraq began -- it leaped to 86 percent.
The catch is that the popularity arising from such rally events is temporary. Professor Mueller and other scholars find that what creates lasting effects on a President's standing are economic events. And these can be appraised by correlating approval ratings with changes in the unemployment rate.
In April 1981, for instance, the unemployment rate was 7.2 percent and President Reagan's popularity stood at a strong 68 percent, in the wake of an assassination attempt. By the start of 1983, unemployment had leapt to 10.8 percent -- while Mr. Reagan's popularity had plummeted to an alarming 35 percent.
There's fragility evident in Mr. Bush's present standing. Despite all the popular support for his policies in the gulf, little seems to translate into support for his other policies. In recent weeks, approval for his handling of the economy has consistently been 40 points lower than his gulf rating.
Portentously, the unemployment rate has been going up since June, rising almost a full point to 6.1 percent in January, and it's likely to keep climbing. That's sure to mean bad news for Mr. Bush. But to stop at that would be as shortsighted as it is to make too much of the present 91 percent. Between now and the next election, the President's popularity is likely to change -- and change again.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Forgotten Friends

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
This is a letter of regret to certain foreign friends with whom I have lost touch since Iraq began the Persian Gulf war in August.
They are men and women who live in danger because they struggle against oppression, in their own lands, far from the Middle East. 
 I have in mind these friends: Chinese students and workers rotting in Communist jails, citizens of the Baltics trying to redeem the independence stolen from them, Tibetan scholars traveling from nation to nation desperately reminding the world of the existence of a captive, devastated nation, and democratic activists in the Soviet Union fighting Mikhail Gorbachev as he resolutely marches forward into the past.
Perhaps "lost touch" is too self-forgiving a phrase. I knew what they were going through but like most of my colleagues and our Government found mind and work seized by a danger that seemed far more immediate in our own lives, Saddam Hussein.
 I would get letters now and then from the Soviet Union or the Baltics, or from a wandering Tibetan, or an American fighting for the Chinese students saying please do not forget.
 Never any recrimination, because they all understood. After all, what print or TV time could the Dalai Lama or a Baltic president expect when competing with the ugly-mouthed Iraqi Ambassador to Washington, who proclaimed his master's inevitable victory a half-dozen times a day.
 So while the spotlight was on one dictatorship, others were taking advantage of the shadows.
The Chinese Communists handed out long sentences to Chinese who were heroes in the U.S. during the Tiananmen spring. Foreign correspondents in Beijing reported what they could collect about the kangaroo trials, but the world's eyes watered with boredom.
By the time the "trials" were held international sanctions against Beijing had virtually been dropped. High representatives of Communist China were again being toasted in Washington and other capitals. Still, Beijing is sensitive to outside criticism, terribly. Foreign alertness is often the only protection for Beijing's prisoners.
Beijing's objective is to have it three ways -- tighten restrictions, punish Tiananmen "offenders" and persuade the world that all is peace and harmony inside China.
As put by Asia Watch, the American human rights group: "The war in the gulf provides a perfect cover for carrying out this strategy."
 Ever since 1950, Tibetans have been tortured, murdered and deported by the Communist Chinese occupiers to eradicate their national memory. That failed. But Beijing does not yield and in July ordered a "tough new crackdown" on the independence movement.
In all its time of suffering, Tibet never got much attention in the U.S. Washington wants to forget its existence. For the press it is too remote, too enclosed by Chinese barricades. So with the gulf war on, the newest crackdown in Tibet was blacked out. But he is a good and strong man, the Dalai Lama. He and his people will go on fighting, not much thanks to us.
Mikhail Gorbachev cannot hide the Soviet Union as Beijing blanks out Tibet and most of China. If we read the newspapers -- TV has not been adequate on the Soviet Union during the gulf war, I am delighted to report -- we know that the repression in the Baltics continues every day. We know that soldiers and the K.G.B. now can march into every Soviet business, every home searching for "economic crimes."
Foreigners who invest money in the Soviet Union while Mr. Gorbachev reigns are asking to hear an unpleasant sound -- the midnight knock on the door.
We know that Mr. Gorbachev is taking back control of the press, TV and the economy as fast as he can. All of this seems a deliberate decision by Mr. Gorbachev to risk civil war if that is the price of propping up the Soviet system to which he clings.
We know, but we doze and our Government hardly twitches. Washington has pawned its freedom of protest in return for the Kremlin's on-and-off support in the gulf. When Mr. Gorbachev tried to rescue Saddam Hussein by preventing the ground attack, President Bush adroitly tripped him. But Mr. Bush somehow felt obliged to go on saying thank you, thank you to Mr. Gorbachev.
Now the big postwar question will occupy us. Will there be a new Middle East or will it remain a place of war and hate? But now at least we should be able to lift our heads, and remember all friends who share the one overriding value of freedom, from Moscow to Lhasa.

L.A. Joe Group Headed By New York Retailer

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Meir Panigel, who owns eight clothing stores in New York City, has become the principal shareholder and head of a group that has bought the owner of L.A. Joe, the 70-store closeout chain. The core units of the chain are 55 former Heck's discount stores in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky in what are mostly economically depressed rural areas.
The closeout chain was sold to the Panigel group less than a year after the brothers Joe and Avi Nakash, owners of Jordache Enterprises, the jeans maker, bought the Heck's stores. At that time, the discount chain had failed to turn a profit after emerging from voluntary bankruptcy. But Joe Nakash said in a statement, "Despite a sluggish economy, we were able to expand the chain from 55 to 70 stores, and sales have been surprisingly good." 
 In a recent interview in L.A. Joe's Manhattan offices amid telephone conversations and hurried interchanges with partners, the 45-year-old Mr. Panigel said: "We feel that 70 stores are enough for us to build on and we hope to do so by increasing business in each. We are planning to add more branded goods and jewelry, and in those stores located in the hunting country, we will add guns and ammunition."
The short, dark-haired Mr. Panigel is a native of Israel whose family, he said, has been in that country for more than 10 generations. After acquiring some retail experience there, he came to the United States in 1982 and started a wholesale clothing business in Hoboken, N.J. Afterward, he opened his own retail chain, the American Sneakers and Jeans Company, comprising eight stores in urban locations and shopping centers in the New York area.
The Nakashes, whose Jordache jeans business now accounts for about $600 million in sales, said they had decided to divest themselves of the L.A. Joe chain because it did not meet their criteria of profit return and also made excessive demands on their time. Mr. Panigel, who was part of the original buying group for Heck's, will continue to serve as president of the Retail Acquisition Corporation, the company that owns L.A. Joe. The new transaction provides for a three-year deferral on the Nakashes' loans to the retail chain, where additional financing has also been obtained.
"I want to build up our sales this year to $150 million, from $133 million last year," Mr. Panigel said. "This is a period when closeout merchandise is very much in demand, especially in our operating area, where many people do not make much money. There are lots of merchandise available, too, in the clothing industry because regular retail business has been slow."

Economic Ills: Poor Are Sicker, Clinic Is Poorer

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
A frail woman stopped by the East New York Neighborhood Family Care Center to pick up some medicine. She also needed to talk.
Two of her three children are gone. So the Housing Authority ordered her to move to a smaller apartment in the same project. Moving costs ate up her Social Security check, and she could afford neither food nor rent. There is no running water in her bathroom. The son remaining with her, who is in his 20's and has epilepsy, had just suffered a particularly violent seizure. 
 The woman was fighting to hold it together, and hers isn't an unusual story in this tattered patch of Brooklyn. Her tears were bitter.
Martha Robinson, whose title is patient representative, arranged for a church to help pay the woman's rent and for an organization for the elderly to give her food. Hardly traditional medicine, but it was all in a day's work at the health clinic, born in a storefront in 1975 after community residents staged sit-ins in the Mayor's office to demand it.
"The word no is just not used around here," declared Miss Robinson.
The East New York center, at 2094 Pitkin Avenue, is one of five in the city. It provides services from obstetrics to classes for pregnant teen-agers to geriatrics. The focus is defensive, preventing illness.
Dr. J. Emilio Carillo, president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation, wants to shift poor people's basic care from hospital emergency rooms to such centers. But the centers are bleeding.
 State and city budget cuts have reduced the staff of the East New York center by 35 over the last two years, to 130, and more cuts are coming. Moreover, the Bush Administration has proposed shifting Federal money now going to centers into a new program to stem infant mortality.
 No one objects to saving babies. But New York City is fighting the proposed cut in community health funds in Washington as the latest blow to the sick and needy. Overall Federal spending for public health has been reduced in each of the last 10 years, a pattern other levels of government have emulated.
The effect of the cuts is debatable. But many Americans -- particularly the poor -- are clearly having more health problems. There is a new epidemic of measles, a steep rise in tuberculosis and a huge increase in sexually transmitted diseases.
Dr. Carillo speaks forcefully of "bad political choices at every level -- choices that are leaving many of our poor communities literally fighting for their lives."
The need for places like the East New York center is underlined by an increase from 35,000 patient visits five years ago to more than 50,000 last year. Antonio Martin, the center's administrator, says the number could grow by another 15,000 in each of the next two years.
Why? "Our patients are a lot sicker," he said.
The major killers of blacks, who make up half the center's patients -- heart disease, hypertension, strokes and cancer -- are rising astronomically. So are diseases disproportionately striking Hispanic people, who account for 45 percent of the patients -- diabetes, kidney illness and stomach cancer.
People entering the center the other day were greeted by a nurse chirping things like, "What's happening, Joe?" A sign announced a potluck dinner. Junior high students were learning to take blood pressure. Miss Robinson was packing literature for a health fair.
In the basement, mammograms are now available. A $100,000 machine was purchased 18 months ago, but wasn't used until Feb. 6. Mr. Martin explains that a major reason for the delay was the difficulty of finding a radiologist willing to work here for modest pay.
One was finally found, part time. So the women of Brooklyn, who account for nearly a third of the state's breast-cancer cases, are lining up. "I've been putting it off since last year, even though my mother has cancer, " Joann Ellis said in the waiting room.
One alternative to community centers is emergency rooms, far more expensive. Another is private clinics that have come to be called Medicaid mills because most of their patients are subsidized by that program. But many poor people aren't eligible for Medicaid.
And neither takes a preventive approach. At Medicaid mills, a hypertension patient will likely be tossed some pills, says Dr. Edward Toseland, the center's medical director. At the East New York clinic, he will be sent to a nutritionist.
But in this kind, gentle, unexpectedly cheerful corner of a merciless world, absolutely nothing is getting easier. "We are seeing a lot of the end stage of disease," said Dr. Pamela Sass, director of family medicine.
"The staff is becoming tired," Dr. Toseland sighed. "They really are."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY;
Dry California Turns to the Pacific

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 5

 BODY:
With California in the grip of a five-year drought, cities and utility companies in this state are building the nation's first large-scale plants to desalt seawater.
In turning to desalting, cities like Santa Barbara and companies like Southern California Edison are using a technology already extensive in the Middle East and other parts of the world to produce fresh water. Until now the high construction costs and operating costs of such plants made little economic sense in the United States. 
 In Southern California, it could cost about four times as much to produce fresh water from seawater in a modern desalting plant as it would to obtain water from natural sources.
But the demand for water from a growing population, the effects of the drought on the cost and availability of normal supplies and technical improvements in the desalting process have caused planners in some areas to increasingly consider desalting.
"As other sources of water become more expensive or less available, desalination becomes more attractive," said Gary Snyder, the chief engineer for the Metropolitan Water District. The agency supplies water for the Los Angeles area and is involved in several pilot programs and studies on desalting water from the Pacific Ocean.
The process is already well under way in coastal communities that suffer from particularly acute water problems. Later this spring Southern California Edison, a unit of the SCE Corporation, will start the first permanent seawater desalting plant intended to serve a residential community in this country.
The plant is on Catalina Island, off the coast near Long Beach. The drought and new construction on Catalina have combined to leave the island with an urgent need for new sources of water.
The $2 million to $3 million plant, financed by a developer who needed the water to complete a luxury condominium project, will produce 132,000 gallons of fresh water a day, more than a quarter of the island's total needs.
Santa Barbara, on the central coast of California, is completing plans to build a desalting plant to help ease a critical drought in that area. Other coastal areas, including Marin County, north of San Francisco, are studying the construction of desalting plants.
Not everyone agrees it is time to turn to desalting. Some experts here say California, even after a long drought, is a long way from the chronic water shortages that would justify the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to build strings of desalting plants. Large-scale desalting in California would also inevitably face opposition on environmental grounds, since it would require building huge industrial plants along the coast of a state that has increasingly limited coastal development.
Environmentalists say that conservation is a far more efficient way of dealing with the water shortage, and that it would be a mistake to invest in desalting just to allow the state's extraordinary growth rate to continue.
Still, the California drought has also prompted the Federal Government to consider financing research into advances in desalting. Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, proposed legislation last month that would provide $10 million for research next year, with that increasing to $50 million two years later. Senator Simon said he had already won support from the Bush Administration, which asked for $10 million for the program in its proposed budget for next year.
"Desalination and water shortages have begun to attract more attention," Mr. Simon said. "Soon, the people of Illinois and other states will be paying more for groceries because of California's drought. The irony is California has hundreds of miles of coast and huge potential sources of water just offshore."
The California drought and the increased public awareness of desalting resulting from news coverage of desalting plants in the Persian Gulf during the war with Iraq have created a potential business boom for the desalting industry.
The worldwide industry is dominated by large companies like Bechtel and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan, both of which are major builders of plants in the Middle East. In the United States, smaller companies like Ionics Inc., which have an expertise in the synthetic membranes used to filter salt from water in one type of desalting process, are also seeing increased demand. Ionics is a water treatment company based in Watertown, Mass.
 
'Tremendous Interest'
 Executives at several companies said they had never had so many inquiries from communities interested in exploring desalting.
"There is tremendous interest," said Leon Awerbuch, the manager of desalting and power programs for the Bechtel Corporation, the San Francisco-based engineering and construction company.
Desalting has been in use for more than 30 years. According to the International Desalination Association, 7,500 desalting plants are operating in 120 countries with a total production capacity of nearly 3.5 billion gallons a day. Desalting plants are relatively common in a few regions of the United States, including Florida, but they are used almost exclusively to purify brackish ground water in coastal areas rather than to treat seawater. Brackish ground water generally has about 10 percent of the salt content in seawater.
Two basic technologies are now used to remove the salt. The most common is distillation, which involves boiling salt water in a series of chambers, with the resulting steam condensing into fresh water. Distillation accounts for 61 percent of the world's total desalting capacity. The world's largest plant, the 270-million-gallon-a-day Jubail operation in Saudi Arabia, uses the distillation technology, as do most other major plants in the Middle East.
 
The Filter Method
 The other commonly used process and the one increasingly popular for smaller projects, like those in many Caribbean nations and most of those under way or planned in California, is called reverse osmosis. Reverse osmosis involves injecting water under high pressure through a fine membrane that filters out both suspended and dissolved solids, leaving nothing but pure water.
Reverse osmosis takes less energy than distillation because the water needs no boiling. The drawback is that reverse osmosis plants generally have less capacity because of the limits of the membranes to hold up under the pressurized flow of water.
Utility executives and other experts say a modern desalting plant could produce fresh water from seawater for $1,000 an acre foot. An acre foot is 326,000 gallons, or enough to supply two households for a year. The cost of water from natural sources in Southern California is about $250 an acre foot in normal times. That has risen in some areas because of the drought. On Catalina, for example, the cost from natural sources is about the same as for desalting.
 
Costs Compared
 Advocates of desalting say the price of natural water in California, which has long been subsidized by government spending for the state's huge system of dams, reservoirs and aqueducts, will inevitably rise as demand outpaces supply. And they say that the cost of desalting will fall as the technology continues to improve.
"I'm of the belief that we can no longer rely on Mother Nature to provide water for California," said Richard Polanco, a Democrat in the California State Assembly who has proposed legislation to finance more desalting plants. "The water bureaucrats are touting conservation and cutbacks, which are essential, but what California really needs is to manufacture its own supply of water, which we can do with desalination."
Santa Barbara has hired Ionics, the water treatment company. The city is studying a $36 million plant that could produce nearly 9 million gallons a day within a year, although plans for a smaller plant are also under consideration. The larger plant could supply more than half of Santa Barbara's needs. But half of the desalted water would probably be sold to surrounding water districts.
Last month a consortium from Bechtel and five California utilities said they hoped to build a desalting plant with a capacity of 100 million gallons a day in conjunction with an electric power plant on the Pacific Coast near Tijuana, Mexico.
Most experts think the largest plants will continue to use the distillation technology. Some industry executives have high hopes for a variation of the distillation process, known as multiple effect distillation, that can operate at lower temperatures and therefore reduce energy costs.
They also say there is greatly increased interest in building distillation plants in conjunction with electric power generation plants, using the leftover heat from the power generation to drive the desalting process. There is also work under way into new technologies. The Puraq Company of Stamford, Conn., is working with a process to separate fresh water from salt water with a chemical solvent.
"There is continued advancement in the technologies," said Mr. Awerbuch of Bechtel. "Right now we're not reducing costs by anything like 10 or 20 percent a year, but there's continued improvement in distillation and in reverse osmosis, both in capital cost reduction and in the energy component."

'Desalting Water With Flash Distillation'
 
Multistage flash distillation is the most common process for desalting seawater, accounting for more than half of the output from water-desalting plants worldwide. Many plants in the Middle East use this process.
 
1. Cold seawater enters a feed tube that passes through a series of chambers to a heater.
 
2. Heated water enters a chamber where it boils. The steam, which is salt-free, hits the outside of the pipe carrying cold seawater and condenses.
 
3. The seawater that did not boil is pumped into another chamber, with lower pressure. Becuase the boiling point drops as pressure decreases, no more heat has to be added. Steam once again condenses and the process is repeated in additional chambers.
 
4. Fresh water enters usable supplies and a salty concentrate is discharged. (pg. D7)

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Down In January

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
Factory orders for manufactured goods dropped by 1.7 percent in January, their third straight decline, the Government said today, but analysts saw signs of some improvement by summer.
"We should start seeing some rebound late in the second quarter," said Evelina Tainer, an economist at the First National Bank of Chicago. 
 But the Commerce Department report showed that America's manufacturing sector remained mired in the recession, with orders for durable and nondurable goods dropping to a seasonally adjusted rate of $230.6 billion in January.
 
December Drop Is Revised
 Even the level of orders in December, originally reported to have been unchanged from November, was worse than first thought. The department revised it down to a decline of five-tenths of a percent.
A 5.8 percent decline in November was the largest one-month plunge on record after orders peaked in October at $250.1 billion.
Since factory orders are a gauge of manufacturing industry plans for production, a decrease often forecasts a slump and future layoffs.
In fact, the Labor Department reported earlier that factory payrolls fell by 69,000 in January, bringing manufacturing job losses since January 1989 to 900,000.
 
Analysts Are Optimistic
 But some analysts believe the worst of the recession may have passed. Ms. Tainer noted that non-military orders for capital goods, excluding aircraft, rose by 3.1 percent in January, to $30.7 billion, after a 1.5 percent gain in December.
"It goes along with our view of a recovery," she said of the gauge.
But in January, durable and non-durable orders fell.
The revised decline in orders for durable goods, items ranging from cars to computers that are expected to last more than three years, was twice as steep as first reported last week.
Durable goods orders actually were down by 1.8 percent, to $117.8 billion, rather than by seven-tenths of a percent as originally reported.
 
Transportation Orders Down
 Transportation equipment orders fell by 3.9 percent, to $30.6 billion, after a 13.2 percent gain a month earlier. A large drop in aircraft orders offset an increase in motor vehicles. Excluding the transportation category, orders fell by 1.4 percent.
Electrical machinery orders fell by 12.1 percent, to $18.6 billion, nearly erasing a 14.5 percent increase in December.
Military orders dropped by 9.7 percent, to $7.2 billion, after a 51.6 percent gain in December during the buildup for the Persian Gulf war. Excluding the category, orders fell by 1.4 percent.
Orders for nondurable goods fell for the fourth straight month, by 1.7 percent, to $112.8 billion. They had fallen by 3.9 percent in December.
Unfilled orders, an indication of how busy factories will be in future months, slipped by two-tenths of a percent, to $519.5 billion. Inventories were unchanged at $374.9 billion.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mostly Higher; Gold Is Down in New York

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar strengthened against most foreign currencies yesterday as traders nervously watched ethnic unrest in the Baltic republics of the Soviet Union and speculated about the prospects for economic growth in the United States.
Currency traders began buying dollars on reports describing President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's trouble maintaining Soviet control in the Baltic region, said Curtis Perkins, a trader for Chemical New York Capital Markets Group. The dollar typically strengthens in times of international turmoil. 
 A trader at the Marine Midland Bank said the dollar gained because of large commercial demand in Europe and perceptions that the worst of the American recession had passed. The rebuilding of eastern Germany is expected to increase demand for dollars in the coming months.
 
Yen Loses Ground
 Nicholas Sargen of Salomon Brothers said the yen lost ground against the dollar after the release of a survey on Japanese capital spending. The Bank of Japan survey predicted only a 1 percent rise in capital spending for the 1991 fiscal year, a sharp drop from 17 percent in 1990.
"This is one of the clearest indications we have of the slowing in the Japanese economy," Mr. Sargen said.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.47 yen to close at 134.88 yen. Later in London, the dollar regained almost all of that and was quoted at 135.30 yen. By the time trading concluded in New York, the dollar fetched 136.30 yen, up 0.81 yen from late Monday.
The British pound declined against the dollar in New York, closing at $1.8913, down from $1.9008 Monday.
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday levels, included: 1.5440 German marks, up from 1.53265; 1.32545 Swiss francs, down from 1.3355; 5.2590 French francs, up from 5.2185; 1,153.50 Italian lire, up from 1,144.75, and 1.15705 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15515.
In London, gold traded at a bid price of $365.25 an ounce late yesterday, down from $366 late Monday. In Zurich, the bid price was $364.20, down from $365.60 late Monday. In Hong Kong, gold dropped $1.19 to close at $365.33.
At the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery closed at $364.70 a troy ounce, down $3.20 from Monday's closing of $367.90. New York's Republic National Bank quoted a later bid of $364 an ounce, down $3.40.
Silver traded in London at a bid price of $3.86 an ounce, up from $3.82 on Monday. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, silver for current delivery closed at $3.841 an ounce, down from Monday's close of $3.856.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
On Dividends, Bad News Grows

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to dividends, the good news is almost always much greater than the bad news. That is a sign of the enduring strength of the American economy and a reason for long-term increases in stock prices.
But this year, the amount of good news is getting to be less and less, and the bad news is growing rapidly. Such crescendos of bad news typically come at the bottoms of bear markets, but this one is coming with stock indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 at a record level. 
 Last year, the overall dividends on the S.&P. 500 came to $12.10 per unit of the S.& P. 500, then worth $330.22. But by the end of the year the indicated rate -- the amount that would be paid if all companies maintained their current payouts -- was $12.33. In January, with companies announcing increases, the indicated rate rose to $12.40 on Feb. 1.
But with many companies cutting dividends, among them General Motors, the indicated rate had fallen to $12.19 by early this week, Arnold Kaufman, the editor of S.& P.'s Outlook newsletter, said yesterday. At that dividend level, the S.& P. 500 now yields 3.24 percent. By contrast, at the end of last year, when the indicated dividend level was higher and share prices lower, the indicated yield was 3.73 percent.
Whether that low level of dividends proves a problem is likely to depend on whether the economy recovers soon, as stock buyers seem to expect, and just how long it takes for companies to respond to improved business by raising payouts.
Historically, stock prices have often been in dangerously high territory when the dividend payout fell below 3 percent, as happened in 1987. Using actual dividend payouts, rather than indicated levels, S.& P. calculates that the low payout in that year, as prices peaked in August, was 2.86 percent.
There is still room for further increases in share prices by those measurements, but they would seem to indicate that the biggest part of the rally is behind us. To get to a 3 percent yield, at the current level of dividends, the S.& P. would have to rise 7.9 percent, to 406.33. A 2.86 percent yield would be reached if the index climbed 13.1 percent, to 426.22. Those increases are far smaller than the 27.5 percent gain that has been registered since prices hit bottom on Oct. 11.
Another way of looking at dividend levels is simply to count announcements of dividend changes. By that measure, the last couple of months have reached lows not seen since the 1958 recession, falling below the figures recorded in such severe downturns as 1974-75 and 1981-82.
By S.& P.'s count, 101 companies announced good dividend news for their shareholders last month -- including initial dividends, increases and extra dividends. That was the lowest figure for any February since 1958. Because dividend announcements are seasonal, with many companies announcing them early in the year, comparisons must be made to similar months of previous years.
Even so, there are more companies announcing good news for shareholders than announcing bad news. By S.& P.'s count, 47 companies announced bad news in February, by either cutting or eliminating their payouts.
Among the companies that have announced higher payouts in recent weeks are Coca-Cola, Kellogg, B. F. Goodrich, Pitney Bowes, and Kimberly-Clark. Wall Street's woes are well known, but Morgan Keegan, a regional brokerage firm with headquarters in Memphis, bolstered its payout. And while the number of banks cutting or eliminating payouts continues to grow -- First City Bancorporation of Texas eliminated its payout yesterday -- some other, generally smaller, banks have managed to increase theirs. Among them are Commercial Bancorp of Oregon and First National Bancorp of Georgia.
Still, that run of good news is at the lowest level in years, and an important issue is whether the trend will soon turn around. "By the second half of the year, I think we will see some improvement," said Mr. Kaufman of S.&P. He added that for now "the figures are getting to be lopsided." Mr. Kaufman noted that the ratio of 101 companies raising dividends in February, compared with 23 cutting them, was 4.39 to 1.
That was the lowest figure for any month since July 1982, when it was just 3.6. At that time, stock prices were bottoming and stocks were set to begin a major bull market.
For those who follow dividend announcements seeking clues to future stock market action, the picture is mixed. Typically in the past, when companies were announcing relatively few dividend increases, share prices were low and the dividend yield was relatively high. It was at that time, when both corporate boards and investors were most depressed, that stocks were destined to rise as spirits recovered.
Now, it appears that corporate boards remain worried, a fact reflected by the low level of dividend increases, but share buyers are far more optimistic and prices, as measured by dividend yields, are relatively high.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Live Cattle Prices at High; Oil Up as Rise Continues

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Live cattle futures prices hit an all-time high of 81.60 cents a pound yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting strength in cash cattle prices.
Live cattle futures settled 0.48 cent to a cent higher, with the contract for delivery in April at 81.47 cents a pound, after surging to 81.60 cents earlier in the session. The prices exceeded the previous record intraday high of 81.25 cents and a record settlement of 81.10 cents reached on Dec. 17. 
 Feeder cattle were 0.15 cent to 0.55 cent higher, with the March contract at 90.32 cents a pound; live hogs were 0.12 cent to 1.15 cents higher, with April at 52.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 0.95 cent to 1.85 cents higher, with March at 64.87 cents a pound.
Cattle futures have risen steadily for more than three weeks, along with prices paid on the cash market by meatpackers to obtain supplies for slaughter.
Oil prices inched up on the New York Mercantile Exchange as fears of dwindling gasoline supplies drove the market higher for a seventh straight session.
Crude oil was 6 cents lower to 18 cents higher, with the contract for April at $20.43 a barrel; home heating oil was 0.54 cent to 0.96 cent higher, with April at 57.09 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1 cent to 1.5 cents higher, with April at 70.90 cents a gallon; natural gas was unchanged to 1.5 cents lower, with April delivery at $1.355 a 1,000 cubic feet.
Analysts have attributed the rally in cattle futures mainly to the lack of an increase in cattle marketing that was expected to occur last month. Retail demand for beef has held steady. The anticipated supply bulge is tied to Government reports showing the United States cattle herd to be the largest since 1974.
Dale Durchholz, livestock analyst with Agrivisor Inc. in Bloomington, Ill., said the livestock markets might be drawing strength from the general relief over the end of the Persian Gulf war and a related perception that the economic recession might be short.
Wheat and soybean futures prices rose strongly for the fourth straight day on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rising worries about dry growing conditions in the Plains states and southern Brazil. Corn futures closed mostly higher.

HEADLINE: New Banking Restrictions Are Proposed

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 5

 BODY:
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee proposed legislation today that would require banks to suspend dividend payments and bonuses for senior executives if they failed to satisfy regulatory requirements.
The measure by the Senator, Donald W. Riegle Jr., Democrat of Michigan, is the latest to address the crisis in the banking industry and the dwindling money in the program that insures depositors. 
 The Senator's plan says that if a bank falls below its required level of capital -- the amount of investment in the bank that can be used as a cushion against losses -- it must suspend dividend payments, limit its growth and file a plan to restore its financial condition. If it fails to follow the plan, then it must suspend bonuses to executives. Regulators would also have the authority to restrict a bank's business, limit the interest rates it pays for deposits, dismiss top bank officials and require a new election of directors.
The proposal is a marked contrast to the Bush Administration's sweeping recommendation to strike down laws, going back to the Depression, that restrict interstate banking and generally prohibit investment banks and commercial banks from merging. The most likely elements of Senator Riegle's plan to be adopted are those that give the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation the authority to impose bank premiums on institutions based upon their financial health and that limit Federal insurance coverage for joint accounts.
At a hearing today of the Banking Committee, Mr. Riegle said he had not ruled out considering the Administration's plan, but strongly suggested that its only real hope of passage would be in pieces. That approach would mean those parts of the plan dealing with the most pressing problems would be considered first.
Mr. Riegle and Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, said today that the most urgent issue facing Congress was how to bolster the dwindling resources of the $8.4 billion F.D.I.C. Some estimates say the fund, which insures individual accounts up to $100,000, could be insolvent by the end of the year, given the rising number of large bank failures.
Mr. Reischauer said the deposit insurance system and taxpayers "could be severely strained" if Congress acted to expand the power of banks before it addressed bank insurance.
In contrast, the Treasury Department has remained silent on specific approaches to working out the troubles of the insurance fund, leaving it almost entirely in the hands of the F.D.I.C. The chairman of the F.D.I.C., L. William Seidman, last week proposed a $25 billion increase in the agency's authority to borrow money.

HEADLINE: A New Car for Malaysia, New Influence for Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia

 BODY:
In the early 1980's, the Prime Minister of Malaysia set a goal that most developing nations would never attempt: to build a national car that would put Malaysians on the move and spur the industrialization of a country known mostly for its rubber plantations and tin mines.
No one in Malaysia had ever built a car before, and the project nearly died. Then, three years ago, the Malaysian managers were dismissed and the country called in a team of Japanese led by a no-nonsense production engineer from Mitsubishi. 
 Today, Japan's mark is hard to miss. At rush hour each morning, swarms of identical models of Southeast Asia's first native car, the four-door compact Proton Saga, jam Kuala Lumpur's streets. On the long road up to the Cameron Highlands it is not uncommon to see Protons, with their signature Malaysian flag on the hood ornament, being inspected by tribesmen who walk along the road with the long blowguns they still use for hunting.
The Proton is a symbol not just of the speed with which countries like Malaysia are trying to replicate the industrial booms of South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, but also of how Japan has gradually tranformed itself into the single most important element in the region's economy. The strategy reaches well beyond Malaysia and is part of Tokyo's industrial plan for turning much of Southeast Asia into Japan's manufacturing backyard.
Indeed, Japan's economic embrace of this region has gone virtually unchallenged. While American oil companies are active here and many American high-tech companies run assembly operations in Singapore and on Malaysia's west coast, most American companies that left the region during the Vietnam War never returned.
Japanese executives hope the lure of Eastern Europe will distract their American and European competitors. After five years of intense investments, Japan's economic reach through the area is nearly all-encompassing, challenged only by a recent investment spurt from other Asian countries, particularly Taiwan.
The Japanese strategy is to play an unobtrusive but commanding role, trying to stay as inconspicuous as possible in a country that it invaded just 50 years ago. The Proton is perhaps the best example of that effort -- and its success.
 
Biggest Industry in Malaysia
 In return for their technology and expertise, Mitsubishi Motors and the leader of its huge industrial group, the Mitsubishi Corporation, own nearly a third of the Proton, which is now Malaysia's biggest industrial enterprise. They have taken hundreds of eager workers who grew up amid Malaysia's lush hill country and tea plantations, shipped them to Japan for six months and sent them back to lecture on the wonders of quality circles and just-in-time manufacturing.
Taking a page from Japan's own post-World War II industrial history, Malaysian officials have set up a series of tax incentives and trade barriers that make buying a $10,000 Proton the most affordable choice for the top slice of Malaysian consumers who buy cars. Mitsubishi's network of auto suppliers, who know a sure bet when they see one, are setting up joint ventures with local companies.
As a result, two of every three cars sold in Malaysia last year were Protons. (The others tend to be small Japanese imports, primarily Toyotas and Nissans, and a few Mercedes.) And in true Japanese fashion, Malaysia barely got the hang of stamping body parts before it started exporting. Already, more than 20,000 Protons -- minus the flag on the hood -- have been sold in Britain, once Malaysia's colonial ruler. The buyers are not attracted to the Proton by luxury -- it is drawn from Mitsubishi designs that date from the mid-1980's, with seats that are a bit cramped and a roof that is a little too low -- but rather by its relatively low price and its Japanese quality.
 
'The Natural Choice'
 "Obviously this is not the kind of industry we could build ourselves," said Rafidah Aziz, Malaysia's Minister of International Trade and Industry. "Turning to the Japanese was really the natural choice."
The Japanese presence is most evident here and in Thailand, Tokyo's main manufacturing outposts. The outskirts of Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur are dotted with factories producing Japanese-brand refrigerators, auto parts, television tubes and computer components.
The factories free Japan's highly paid workers to concentrate on manufacturing much higher-tech, higher-value-added goods, Japanese industrialists say, and they serve a political purpose as well: goods shipped abroad from those foreign factories are not counted in Japan's trade surplus.
 
Heavy Foreign Investment
 Last year alone, Japan received approval from the Malaysian Government for $1.5 billion in manufacturing investments in Malaysia, seven times that of the United States. Taiwan invested even more, $2.3 billion. The results are beginning to show: Malaysia seems likely to overtake Japan soon as the world's No. 1 exporter of room air-conditioners, chiefly because the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company is producing 800,000 cars a year here and plans to increase that level soon.
As Thai and Malaysian labor costs rise, Japanese businesses are scrambling for access to Indochina, especially poverty-stricken countries like Vietnam. Like the United States, the Japanese Government banned aid to Vietnam after its occupation of Cambodia 12 years ago, but Japan never joined the American ban on commercial ties.
 
Expecting 'More Thailands'
 Though they complain that progress in Vietnam is often stop and go, Japanese trading houses are already positioning themselves to swap consumer goods for Vietnamese oil and timber, and they are dangling the lure of factories in front of a Communist Government desperate for hard currency.
"These markets look small, so America decides they are not worth the trouble," a senior executive of one of Japan's biggest trading houses said. "That's how you missed Thailand. And 10 years from now, there will be more Thailands."
In part, Japan has been successful in Southeast Asia because its companies are willing to tread lightly. Unlike many American competitors, the Japanese do not insist on majority ownership. They seem less fazed by occasional political instability, shrugging their shoulders at the bloodless military coup in Thailand a week ago. In most cases they exert careful control by placing Japanese in the top management posts and carefully doling out technology.
 
Difficulty in Proton's Beginning
 The Proton is a prime example. When Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad first approached Mitsubishi, he hoped the project would become an element of his long-range plans for a steady industrial buildup led by the country's Malayan majority. While the Malayans hold the political power in the country, the economic scene has long been dominated by the ethnic Chinese, who account for a third of the population. So at first Mitsubishi held back and let Mr. Mahathir put Malayans in charge of the plant.
No sooner had Mitsubishi moved in the equipment -- giant presses and the assembly line -- than the project began to run aground. Production began in the middle of a recession, and for the first three years the plant turned out less than a third of the 80,000 cars it was intended to build each year. Last year it produced slightly more than 80,000, and in 1993 it hopes to turn out more than 120,000.
Thailand and Indonesia, highly protective of their own fledgling automobile industries, refused to import the Proton. Quality was mediocre, at best. Crucial parts had to be imported from Japan. And the factory itself was a mess. "It had all the right equipment," said one Malaysian supervisor, "and no one in charge who knew how to use it."
Eventually Mr. Mahathir did just what Mitsubishi expected: He turned to them to provide management. "I think that even if we had been here from the start, we would have had big problems," said Kenji Iwabuchi, Proton's managing director, who is on loan from Mitsubishi Motors. "But the car was not yet of Japanese quality."
 
Gathering at 8:30 A.M.
 Mr. Iwabuchi and his team of Japanese managers started what he called the "morning market," a gathering at the plant at 8:30 A.M. to pore over the previous day's problems. Robots were installed to improve the quality of welding. Malaysian employees started to show up for Japanese-language classes. In a few months they will begin machining their own engine parts.
The car has already won some overseas awards, and the Proton has begun to make money. Last year it introduced a peppier model with a bigger engine, and there is talk about taking the company public.
And Mr. Mahathir, better known in Asia for his harsh dealings with political opponents, is creating an image as a car designer and marketer. His sayings are posted on the factory floor. Meetings on how to design the next model -- something a little more fashionable, a little faster, a little more Malayan -- are often held in his office.
"The Prime Minister has some strong views; a few weeks ago, he wanted a new shape for the steering wheel," Mr. Iwabuchi said, in a tone that suggested that the steering wheel was about to change shape.
Whether Mr. Mahathir is meeting his social goals, however, is an open question. While 67 percent of the car is now domestically produced, only a fraction of that work goes to the "bumiputera," the native Malays. The Government is giving grants and other advantages to small bumiputeras -- increasing tension with the Chinese community -- but success is slow.
 
Dependence and Good Will
 And the company seems so dependent on its Japanese managers that many doubt they can be replaced.
"Eventually, this has to be Malaysian-spearheaded," Mrs. Rafidah, the Trade Minister, said. "It will not be run by Mitsubishi forever." The Government will not extend tax breaks indefinitely, she said, and recently it decided to let other makers sell cars that compete with the Proton.
But for now, the Proton has done exactly what Japanese officials hoped for: It made Japanese industry an integral part of one of the world's fastest-growing economies, with minimal risk. It is the first step, some Japanese say, to a de facto trade grouping, in which different Southeast Asian nations specialize in technologies that will feed Japan's biggest industrial giants.
And it is building up a lot of good will for the Japanese, who may need it next winter. That is the 50th anniversary of Japan's invasion and occupation of Malaysia during World War II, an anniversary neither Government is likely to mark too loudly.

HEADLINE: Trump Revises Project Plan For West Side

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Standing at City Hall in the presence of old enemies eager to embrace him, Donald J. Trump said yesterday that he had abandoned his plans for a Trump City on the Upper West Side, and would substitute a much smaller, mostly residential project and waterfront park.
With Mayor David N. Dinkins at his side, the developer who epitomized the building boom of New York in the 1980's, said the leaner 1990's had helped persuade him to agree with a coalition of civic groups that fought his plans for a complex that was to have included a 150-story building, the world's tallest, and proposed an alternative. 
 "All you folks convinced me to do really what was right," Mr. Trump said of his plans to give the city land to let it move an elevated stretch of the West Side Highway between 59th and 72d Streets further inland and to build the city a 23-acre park along the Hudson River, all under the working name of Riverside South, though he emphasized no final name had been chosen.
 
'A Boost to Your Pride'
 Asked by a reporter if the compromise was a blow to his ego, Mr. Trump, whose recent financial setbacks made a deal attractive now, blushed and asked Mr. Dinkins whether it should be.
"No, it should not," replied the Mayor, smiling at one of the few bits of good news he has been able to announce amid the city's fiscal doldrums. "It should be a boost to your pride."
It was a scene few among the more than 100 civic, elected and appointed officials, and reporters in the Blue Room could have imagined months ago, involving a developer whose past dealings with the city have sometimes been so nasty that a former deputy mayor, Alair A. Townsend, once said she would not believe him "if his tongue were notarized."
But yesterday, Linda Davidoff, executive director of the Parks Council, one of the groups that led the fight against Mr. Trump's original plan for the more than 70-acre site of the abandoned Penn Central rail yards, kissed him and said that when the new project was done, "Donald, I hope you're going to say to yourself, 'This is the best deal I ever made.' "
Under the compromise, Mr. Trump would withdraw his old proposal for a zoning change that would let him build a project of 14.5 million square feet -- which would have produced towers from 60 to 70 stories and has been stalled for year. His new plan calls for a project of 8.3 million square feet -- which, if approved, would mean a variety of buildings in the 30- to 40-story range, about 5,500 residential units. Overall, if the new plan were approved, Mr. Trump could build more than t one million square feet more than he could without any zoning change at all.
 
No Big Parking Garage
 Mr. Trump would give up plans for a 7,400-car commercial parking garage and a large shopping mall and instead proposed only parking for residents and visitors and street-level neighborhood shops. At the southern end of the site, he would build television and motion-picture studios and about 300,000 square feet of office space, though he said he had no specific tenants in mind.
Instead of being set off from the rest of the Upper West Side, the development would extend the existing street-grids to the new park.
Because of his own financial troubles, it is highly unlikely that Mr. Trump can obtain bank financing to build on the site himself any time soon. His arrangement with his creditors requires that income from any assets go first toward paying off his creditors.
But breaking the political logjam over the site, and obtaining the higher zoning, would mean that a property that has been only a drain for years would be more valuable for him to sell off parts to other developers, which he has said he plans to do, while reserving some for himself.
 
Plans for Monitoring Project
 Still, the compromise is little more than a broad outline and will require months of study and eventual approval by the City Planning Commission and the City Council. And local elected officials and the civic groups with whom he compromised made it clear that they were not abandoning their intention to monitor plans for the project.
State Senator Manfred Ohrenstein, speaking for several other legislators, praised Mr. Trump's new proposal, but when he said, "it has yet to be established that even a density of 8.3 million square feet is required to make the development economically viable," Mr. Trump could not resist interrupting to exclaim, "It is!"
While Mr. Trump tried to assure widespread support for his new plan, not all groups in the neighborhood endorsed it fully. One, the Coalition for a Livable West Side, supported the idea for the park but said the proposed size of the project was still too large.
Asked if he would seek tax abatements from the city to make it easier for him to develop the project, Mr. Trump said, "We'll be asking for nothing different from any other developer in the city of New York."
Moving the West Side Highway is a major element of the plan, but even representatives of the civic groups conceded it might not happen for a decade. The existing stretch of road is in such bad shape that the state is moving to rehabilitate it, mostly with Federal money, but supports tearing it down eventually.
Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that there was no guarantee that more Federal money would be available for a new road some day, but he said the city was confident it could make a good case.
Despite the air of bonhomie, Mr. Trump's former foes made it clear that they thought they won more than he did. Catharine Cary, executive director of Westpride, another part of the coalition that opposed the plan, ticked off a list of changes and said, "There will be no world's tallest building."
Mr. Trump interrupted to say, "Here." Ms. Cary rejoined, "Watch out, L.A."
Looking around the crowded room, Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge, whose district includes the site, said, "My last word is that if Donald Trump had known it was going to be this big a thing, he would have done it years ago."
Mr. Trump said, "I went with the punches, but they were good punches."

HEADLINE: Dow Closes At 2,972.52, Up by 58.41

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Investors climbed on the Wall Street bandwagon yesterday, driving stock prices sharply higher and lifting trading volume to its highest level in almost a month. Several market indexes established new highs.
The Dow Jones industrial average -- now only 27 points short of its July record -- soared 58.41 pints, or 2 percent, to 2,972.52. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index and the New York Stock Exchange composite index each advanced to new highs, a clear demonstration that investors were coming in across the board. 
 Analysts could not point to any one factor to explain the wave of market euphoria but pointed to a steadily building series of individual events that together meant the economy was gradually improving.
 
'A Lot of Small Things'
 "It's a combination of a lot of small things." said Peter J. Canelo, chief investment strategist for County NatWest Securities. "One huge plus," he said, was that the dollar rallied yesterday against both the Japanese yen and the German mark.
"This tells foreign investors that maybe the U.S. is not such a bad place to invest," Mr. Canelo added.
Hugh Johnson, chief strategist for the First Albany Corporation, said, "The fundamentals don't look particularly inspiring, but I learned a long time ago you don't argue with the stock market."
In an even stronger sign of broad stock buying, the Wilshire 5,000 index, representative of just about every stock, reached a record 3,582.30, up 68.48, or almost 2 percent. The buying frenzy broke the former record of 3,523.47, established just a week before the market collapse in October 1989.
Trading volume, the strongest since Feb. 12, soared to 253.7 million shares, from 199.8 million on Monday. Only 3 stocks dropped to new lows, while 183 stocks rose to new highs, including Litton Industries, which rose 2 1/2, to 86 1/4, after a reaching a new high of 86 1/2. Program trading, typically 10 percent of the day's activity, accounted for almost 24 points of the Dow's gain, Birinyi Associates said.
Except for a small selloff in the final 30 minutes, the Dow moved sharply higher throughout the session. Short-sellers, who sell borrowed stock and hope to profit from price declines, moved in several times during the day but were repeatedly forced to buy back their stock to avoid losses.
 
Big Board Steps In
 Buying was so heavy that the Dow was ahead 50 points by 2:39 P.M., at which point the New York Stock Exchange intervened and imposed its 50-point rule.
When the Dow moves ahead 50 points or more, the Big Board bars program traders from buying any stock, in the S.& P. 500 for example, at a price higher than the previous price, in effect halting most activity for the rest of the day. The procedure is also used when prices are falling to prevent program trading from exaggerating price movements.
Four stocks -- I.B.M., Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble and Westinghouse -- accounted for more than a fourth of the gain in the Dow blue chips.
I.B.M., the leader, jumped 2 7/8, to 133 1/2, with almost 2.5 million shares changing hands. Philip Morris, a highly recommended growth stock, climbed 2 1/4, to 67 5/8, with 3.6 million shares changing hands. Procter & Gamble, which has its eyes on Revlon Inc., rose 1 5/8, to 84 3/4, while Westinghouse, project leader for an international group planning to upgrade the Soviet air-traffic control network, advanced 1 5/8, to 29 5/8. Trading in Westinghouse stock jumped to 3.1 million shares.
"It's very hard to point to any fundamental development," Mr. Johnson said of yesterday's strong advance. "The market's been saying for some time that the recession is going to end and recovery will start at the end of the second or start of the third quarter."
But, he said, "The reason it's doing as well as it's doing is the behavior of the market itself. A lot of investors -- institutional and individual -- still have meaningful cash positions and are feeling uncomfortable with them. There's a growing sense of urgency to get it into the market. The return on cash is looking more dismal with every passing day, and the market is looking better with every passing day."
He said that "the stock market is saying that forecasts on the economy and on earnings are way too pessimistic" but added that he found it "hard to make the case for a strong recovery."
Even so, he said, "My experience says I should take the message of the stock market seriously -- and buy."
Ticking off a list of positive economic indicators, Mr. Canelo of County NatWest noted optimistic signals in the index of leading indicators, the purchasing managers index, the purchasing managers order index, commodity prices, the Barron's confidence index and the dollar.
Asked when the Dow might break the record, which is just short of 3,000, he replied without being more specific, "in short order." He said that oil stocks in the Dow were "dragging it down" and from that standpoint "it's already there."
Nevertheless, he added, "We have a good chance of going into the 3,100 to 3,200 area before valuations look too high. It won't be immediately," he went on, "maybe later this year."
Looking at all the new highs, he said: "The leadership here is still in the small stocks. This is a broad, strong market move. It's telling us the turn in the economy will be sooner rather than later."

HEADLINE: From the Cities to the Coal Mines, Pain of Cutbacks Is Vivid;
Virginia Beach: Will It Choose The 'T' Word?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIRGINIA BEACH, Va.

 BODY:
Unlike almost anyone else in Virginia, officials here in the state's largest city are openly talking about raising taxes.
"The Governor's position is that he is cutting the fat from government, and that this is what the taxpayers want," said Mayor Meyera E. Oberndorf, a political independent. "We're going to have to ask the citizens just how much tax increase they are willing to commit to." 
 The recession caught the city in the midst of an enormous growth spurt that has required large expenditures. Schools, fire stations, jails and roads are under construction to accommodate a 50 percent growth in population in a decade, to 393,000 in 1990.
Social services are particularly vulnerable. "We're looking at real pain here, not potential pain," said Hector A. Rivera, an assistant manager in the human services agency.
"Infants are dying because we can't provide enough prenatal and postnatal care to indigent women, and mentally ill people may have to wait 60 days before seeing a therapist."
Tax increases are not taboo here, in part because property taxes are lower than in neighboring communities and living expenses are relatively low.
The city's per capita income, $16,844 in 1988, is higher than that in most of the state, though slightly below a statewide average skewed by wealthier areas of northern Virginia.
This year, the city coped with a $15.4 million shortage in its $453 million budget, including a $5.2 million reduction in state aid, by imposing a hiring freeze, delaying road maintenance, buying fewer library books and making scores of other nips and tucks.
Officials anticipate reductions in expenditures of more than $19 million in the next fiscal year and they say there are no more easy ways to save money, which is why they are talking about the possibility of raising taxes.
The schools, which depend on the state for 41 percent of their $294 million budget, are considering returning 48 administrators to the classroom, charging for driver education courses and adult education programs and raising the price of school lunches.
But still, many officials favor Gov. L. Douglas Wilder's fiscal policies. "I support the Governor," said Dr. S. John Davis, the acting Superintendent of Schools, who is a former State Superintendent. "He's showing the country that it is possible to maintain government with a satisfactory level of services with declining revenues."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Chronic Poverty, Black and White

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
IS the "underclass" problem really just a black and Hispanic problem? It is a conclusion easily drawn, says Ronald Mincy, an economist at the Urban Institute, and not only by racists. Almost all the big-city neighborhoods plagued by chronic poverty and social decline are black or Hispanic ghettos. And it is these neighborhoods that have been the focus of study, not to mention handwringing, by policy analysts.
But according to Mr. Mincy's new analysis, now circulating in unpublished form, the specter of the underclass also haunts smaller cities. And there, a substantial minority are white. 
 The new findings should help drive home the reality that not every unwed teen-ager with a baby and every high school dropout with a gun has a dark skin. Perhaps as important, Mr. Mincy suggests, it should push researchers toward economic explanations of the underclass phenomenon.
Poor people are simply people who do not have enough money, wherever they happen to live. The underclass consists of the fraction of poor people -- perhaps two million of them -- whose ability to dig their way out is thwarted by life in neighborhoods overwhelmed by violence, drugs and collective despair.
Explanations for the emergence of this spatially concentrated underclass in the last few decades rest, uneasily, on a foundation of economic and social change. William Julius Wilson, a pioneer in the field, argues that declining job opportunities for unskilled workers in cities put great stress on urban blacks. Meanwhile, the end of legal discrimination in work and housing allowed striving blacks with middle-class values to follow the jobs to suburbia. That stripped the old ghettos of positive role models for the young, not to mention the stabilizing influences of churches, P.T.A.'s and fraternal organizations.
Nicholas LehmanLemann, a social theorist and writer, has pressed another, yet more unsettling explanation. The urban culture of the underclass, he argues, is a self-destructive echo of a rural black culture weakened by harsh discrimination and dependence on whites. This explanation is quite different because it turns on the consequences of in-migration rather than out-migration. But Mr. Wilson and Mr. LehmanLemann share the implicit assumption that the underclass problem is a black problem. And 1980 census data from America's 100 largest cities seem to bear them out.
Some 68 percent of residents of "extreme poverty" neighborhoods -- neighborhoods in which at least two-fifths of the population live below the poverty line -- are black. An additional 21 percent are Hispanic, while just 10 percent are white. The figures seem even gloomier in light of the fact that poor blacks are far more likely to live in the worst neighborhoods of the megalopolis than poor whites. All told, one poor black in six lives in an "extreme poverty" neighborhood in a big city, compared with just one poor white in a 100.
The fallacy here, argues Mr. Mincy, is that big cities are not a good statistical surrogate for the nation as a whole. He tailors his data base, combining all of the Census's "extreme poverty" neighborhoods with all neighborhoods ranking high, by four criteria of social decline: single females with children, households on welfare, adult males not in the work force and high teen-age dropout rates. And here the racial profile looks quite different.
Whites represent 28 percent of the population of underclass neighborhoods in cities of less than one million, and roughly 20 percent of the underclass population in all metropolitan areas. What is more, they are not simply the remnants of white ethnic groups living in black or Hispanic neighborhoods; most live in neighborhoods predominantly white.
The goods news here is that racism alone cannot explain the existence of America's underclass. Plainly, racism never prevented whites with a healthy work ethic from fleeing failing neighborhoods. Nor did values forged by discrimination turn whites into criminals, drug addicts or welfare mothers. The bad news is that researchers still do not have a clear sense of why a few million poor people have seemingly been lost to the common culture, or how they might be pulled back into it.
The focus on the big-city underclass, Mr. Mincy believes, has unfairly fed the view that chronic poverty is a minority problem and that non-race-specific policies cannot do much to solve it. But the more realistic profile of the underclass does not, in itself, suggest a politically acceptable palliative. The country that could mobilize to smash the Iraqi Army in 100 hours is rendered helpless by the specter of 15-year-olds with infants and drug habits.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Made Vehicle Sales Off 4.7% in Late February

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 5

 BODY:
Sales of American-made cars and light trucks fell 4.7 percent in late February, compared with a year earlier, auto makers reported today. Analysts said sales remained fairly weak, but not at the dismally low levels of January.
For the month, the drop in sales of domestic and imported vehicles was 13.6 percent. February vehicle sales were the lowest in seven years. 
 The 10 manufacturers with United States plants sold 183,017 domestically made cars in late February, down 5.9 percent from a year earlier. Seasonally adjusted, cars sold at an annual rate of 5.9 million in late February, well below the 6.9 million pace of the period last year. For the last 30 days, the annual selling rate was 6 million.
Light-truck sales dropped 2.1 percent, to 102,081 vehicles, in the 10-day period, which included 7 selling days, the same as last year.
Some auto executives and dealers said the end of the war had brought more customers to their showrooms.
 
Caution Lingers
 "People are still cautious, but they're more willing to get out and spend some pent-up money," said John Ward, sales manager at Galeana Chrysler-Plymouth in Fort Myers, Fla.
Consumer confidence in the economy showed a modest improvement in the first half of February, according to surveys conducted by the Conference Board in New York.
"We anticipate a more enthusiastic March reading," said Fabian Linden, who directs the survey.
For all of February, auto makers sold 625,424 imported and domestic cars, down 13.3 percent from last year. Light-truck sales dropped 14.1 percent for the month, to 286,912.
Honda's car sales fell 37.1 percent in late February. For the month, Honda's sales were down 21.3 percent.
General Motors' sales of American-built cars fell 16.9 percent in late February, to 76,034 cars. Sales of G.M.'s light trucks dropped 10.8 percent, to 38,035 vehicles.
The Ford Motor company sold 50,815 domestically produced cars in late February, an increase of 9.8 percent. Ford's light-truck sales dropped 6 percent, to 33,041 vehicles.
 
Chrysler Truck Sales Down
 Chrysler's total light-truck sales for the month fell 2.2 percent compared with a year earlier, to 57,726 vehicles, despite an increase in mini-van sales, which rose 47 percent in February compared with a year earlier.
Chrysler was able to gain market share in light trucks, to 20.1 percent in February, compared with 17.7 percent a year earlier. An aggressive rebate program helped to raise sales of mini-vans in particular.
Sales of Chrysler's United States-made cars dropped 11.6 percent in February, to 54,370 cars. The company's share of the car market rose, however, to 8.7 percent, from 8.5 percent last year.
General Motors' share of the car market fell to 34.9 percent in February, from 36.4 percent last year. Ford's car market share rose to 22.1 percent, from 21.6 percent a year earlier. The American car market shares of Honda, the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Nissan Motor Company all declined.

HEADLINE: Rally Benefits Some Retailers

 BODY:
Amid the general market surge, the stocks of eight retailing companies reached 52- week highs yesterday, reflecting a perception among investors that the recession could end in the current quarter.
The new highs included Albertson Stores, up $2.50, to $42; Dillard Department Stores, $1.125, to $106; Food Lion, 25 cents, to $16.375; Gap, 62.5 cents, to $47; Home Depot, $2.125, to $51.75; K Mart, $1.25, to $38.625, and Limited, $1.50, to $25.75.
"We think the recession will end in the second quarter," said Daniel D. Barry, Kidder, Peabody's retail analyst in New York. "After being hammered last fall, retail stocks outperformed the market, and now the new highs are telling us that the end of the war will definitely lead to a pickup."
Wayne Hood, a retail analyst at Prudential Capital Funding, said retailing stocks are historically among the first to respond to economic change.

HEADLINE: Panicky Need for Farm Land Leads Nicaraguan Peasants Into Fatal Clash

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PUEBLO NUEVO, Nicaragua, March 1

 BODY:
As peasants buried four of their number killed in a gun battle last week, they said it was the need for land that had led them into a fatal encounter with armed operators of a Sandinista-run farm cooperative.
With Nicaragua's economy reduced almost to subsistence levels by more than a decade of war and socialism, this rare year of peace has produced a panicky drive for land in the countryside as the May planting season approaches. The fighting last Thursday at Corinto Farm here in the northern province of Jinotega, in these mountains where rebels for so long waged war against the Sandinista Army, is perhaps the sharpest reminder of the nation's land problems. 
 "When you don't have any work you look for a place to plant corn," explained a threadbare man holding a machete at the foot of the rutted road leading steeply up to the hillside cemetery. "That's what we were all doing when they started to shoot at us."
 
'We Had Only Machetes'
 "They may have gotten frightened, but we went with no intention of killing anyone," he continued. "We had only machetes. A poor man has to carry that."
Although the Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is obligated by the terms of the disarmament agreement reached last year to give priority to resettling the more than 20,000 former guerrilla fighters -- or contras -- and their families, the episode at Corinto Farm demonstrates that fear of hunger is becoming generalized over rural Nicaragua.
Efforts to satisfy the land need are complicated by a chaotic property rights situation, including more than 10 years of confiscations and nationalizations under the Sandinistas; the return to the country of former property owners, some of them ex-contras, who are now trying to recover their land, and efforts by former members of the Sandinista Army to get land or get into existing cooperatives.
The demand for land extends far beyond the former contras and overshadows the fact that the commission handling the return and resettlement of the ex-rebels, directed by the Organization of American States, has made giant strides in recent months in its program to provide land and simple housing materials to them.
 
Over 7,500 Ex-Contras Settles
 Santiago Murray, an Argentine economist sent by the O.A.S. from Washington to oversee the repatriation program, said over 7,500 ex-contras and their families had been resettled in cooperative arrangements on 124 large farms that were in government hands.
The O.A.S. has a total of 22,400 people on its rolls as ex-contras and, with families, has been feeding almost 95,000 people a month, a program that is to end with the August harvest. Mr. Murray said about a third of the ex-contras are from urban backgrounds and are trying to resettle in towns and cities, and that several thousand others owned their land before the war and are trying to recover it. That leaves about 5,000 for whom the Government and the O.A.S. still hope to find land.
Of the peasants who marched into the farm near here, only a handful were demobilized contras. The others, while probably never combatants, appeared by their comments to have been supporters of Mrs. Chamorro in the elections last year when she defeated former President Daniel Ortega and the Sandinista Front.
"We didn't vote for Dona Violeta to have the same army as before," said one of the mourners. "She has to use a tough hand on the army."
 
Politics and Desires
 Some said they had been working at Corinto until recent months but had been dismissed by the members of the cooperative that the former Sandinista Government had set up on the farm.
As part of the accords that produced a peaceful transition last year, Mrs. Chamorro kept the Sandinista Army and its commander, Gen. Humberto Ortega, but obtained his commitment to reduce the size of the army. In the competition for land, the firepower usually seems to be behind those former soldiers or their collaborators.
There have been a number of other shootings around the country in recent months involving land disputes, and in most cases the victims were either peasants who had voted for Mrs. Chamorro or ex-contras.
Besides those buried here, at least one other person -- the search continued for bodies -- died after some 250 men, women and children walked into the Corinto Farm last Thursday morning with what they said was the intention of trying to negotiate with the cooperative members for bits of land on which to plant.
 
Men With Rifles Waiting
 The peasants said about 20 men with automatic rifles were waiting on the entry road and opened fire. Since the property, like most cooperative farms in this area, also served as a Sandinista army base during the war with the contras, it would not have been unusual for the army to have left large numbers of weapons with trusted civilians or former soldiers.
Lieut. Douglas Ruiz Espinoza, leader of the army patrol that arrived at the farm after the shooting, said his information was that the peasants had arrived with heavy weapons, including mortars. But people who saw the peasants on the road beforehand said they had only machetes.
The fact is that Nicaragua, a land the size of Iowa with fewer than four million people, has more than enough land to satisfy its population, but most of the eastern two-thirds of the country lacks infrastructure.
 
Contras Came From Region
 The result is that most of the pressure for land is in these rich and pleasant coffee mountains of the northwest. In addition, most of those looking for land grew up here and do not want to leave. Likewise, most of the contras came from this region.
Mr. Murray of the O.A.S. said the resettlement program for the ex-contras had originally been planned around so-called "development poles," with the idea of helping populate other parts of the country. But one such pole, in the southeast around the community of El Amendro, was largely abandoned because the settlers thought there were not enough roads and other facilities.
The Government also does not always know who owns what or whether a particular farm is already being worked. This results from a combination of Sandinista giveaway programs and from the property registration system, which is done by hand.
Mr. Murray said that because of conflicting property claims, some farms have ended up being divided three ways: a third of the land for returning former owners, a third for a Sandinista cooperative and a third for ex-contras.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
A New Mideast Balance

BYLINE: By Leslie H. Gelb

 BODY:
Secretary of State James Baker says he is going to the Middle East to listen and consult, and not to present an American peace plan or impose solutions. But that is what all our Secretaries of State say en route to selling U.S. peace plans.
 Indeed, in his next breath, he admits he has a two-track approach for direct talks between Israel and Arab states and for dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians. The theory here seems eminently sensible, and he and President Bush are understandably eager to use victory over Iraq to shape a peaceful future for the Mideast. 
 But their speed of action hints at something troubling: Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker also may be overeager to please their partners in war and are therefore embarking on a vast and delicate diplomatic enterprise before digesting how the war has altered the strategic landscape in the Mideast and how those changes affect American interests.
 Though the fighting ended a mere week ago, two features of the new landscape are already clear: With Iraq cut down to size, no new Arab state stands on the horizon powerful enough to threaten its neighbors and U.S. concerns. With Soviet power sharply reduced, Washington has less cause to worry about Arabs running off to Moscow.
 These features, in turn, suggest that the Bush Administration should think hard about exactly what the U.S. would gain from pressuring Israel to trade land for a potentially risky peace.
 To begin with, the war has leveled the Arab playing field. For the first time since the early 1960's, no single Arab or Muslim figure now looms over the region. There is no Nasser, no Anwar Sadat, no Ayatollah Khomeini, and Saddam Hussein is only a shell of his former self.
 For some time to come, Washington does not have to run around gathering up Arab allies to thwart a brother Arab from acquiring too much power, power that could be used to control oil and threaten the survival of Israel. Egypt has the manpower but lacks the money. Saudi Arabia has the money but not the manpower. Syria has no money and a middling military force. Iraq is diminished. Islamic fundamentalism emanating from Iran presents a genuine threat to stability, but it cannot be combated by alliances.
 The war also clearly revealed that the Soviet Union has become a less central player. Since the end of World War II, the overriding objective of U.S. policy in the Mideast has been to limit Moscow's influence over Mideast oil and geography.
 American support for Israel often got in the way of this larger goal. Arabs would turn to or threaten to turn to Moscow for arms and side with Moscow's policies to punish Washington for backing the Jewish state.
 The U.S. swallowed these costs because its commitment to Israel sprang from deep moral and political roots, and because Israel represented a strong military friend in an unfriendly region. But for the most part, Israel seemed more a strategic liability than a strategic asset.
 Now, with the Soviet Union weakened internally and its arms discredited in combat, the U.S. can help Israel without fearing that the Arabs will reach out reflexively to Moscow.
 These happy strategic facts -- no dominant and unfriendly Arab state and declining Soviet influence -- should not become grounds for complacency. There is still considerable potential in the region for upheaval within Arab states.
 But would U.S. pressure on Israel to empower Palestinians significantly affect those internal struggles? It might. But it is more likely that the fates of friendly Arab leaders will pivot on whether they provide their people economic hope and political dignity.
 Oil remains a worrisome matter. But the Western response, in any event, should be to reduce dependence on Persian Gulf oil. This area will still be volatile even with Arab-Israeli agreements.
 It may well be that Arabs and Israelis need peace in the Mideast far more than the U.S. The debilitating mutual hatred and cost of arms prevents both from seriously addressing their internal problems. Israel, in particular, will have to find funds from its limited resources for settling Soviet immigrants who represent the nation's future. Israelis and Arabs also ought to worry a lot about the growth of nuclear and missile arsenals in a climate of hate.
 For peace, these common interests have to sink in, and the Bush Administration can help that process along. But the U.S. is blessed now with a strong strategic position and does not have to rush off to twist arms and make new commitments.

HEADLINE: Can't City Hall Stop Inflation of Bureaucracy?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I live and work in downtown Brooklyn. I have watched with wonderment the new building under construction on the block bounded by Livingston, Schermerhorn, Boerum and Smith streets, which is to be occupied by the New York City Transit Authority (at a very substantial rent, no doubt).
As I understand it, the Transit Authority will continue to occupy its present building as well. In other words, the swollen bureaucracy has grown so as to necessitate an entire new office building. No wonder fares are going up again! 
 While I'm on the subject, the Board of Education, also in downtown Brooklyn, occupies not only 110 Livingston Street (a large building) and 65 Court Street (an even larger building), but it has also spilled over into yet a third building, at 347 Baltic Street (a former school building). There are numerous offices at other sites throughout the city, as well.
If New York City is serious about doing something to rectify its fiscal problems, it must begin by cleaning its own house. it is inconceivable that the support staff that occupies all this space could possibly be required to operate these agencies effectively.
Let's put our limited resources into the delivery of services, that is, better schools and safer, more efficient subways, not into pushing paper. If not, let us frankly admit that city agencies have become, to a large extent, little more than arms of the welfare system.

HEADLINE: Howard Slims Down and Reaffirms Its Tradition

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA

 BODY:
Less than a year after he was appointed president of the nation's most important black center of higher education, Franklyn G. Jenifer has steered through a set of sweeping changes intended to alter the shape and strengthen the tradition of Howard University.
The changes, which were recommended by Dr. Jenifer and approved by Howard's board of trustees on Saturday, include closing one of the university's largest schools, the School of Human Ecology, which teaches home economics and nutrition, and eliminating several programs, including undergraduate programs in social work, education, geology, pharmacy and astrophysics. 
 Such pruning is intended to cut costs and allow Howard to focus its resources on fields where it is strongest and the need is greatest. The move is a recognition, Dr. Jenifer said, that even this large historically black university with 12,000 students cannot be all things to all African-American people.
But while it cuts back some programs, Howard is adding others, including centers for international affairs, urban affairs, entrepreneurial studies and Islamic studies.
 
Raising Its Sights
 Dr. Jenifer said the university will try to improve its overall academic standing by toughening admissions criteria without simply raising minimum scores for the Scholastic Aptitude Test, and by imposing a more rigid review process for faculty appointments.
"The basic thing I was trying to do is say Howard has made a choice for enhanced quality over quantity," Dr. Jenifer said in a telephone interview from his university office in Washington yesterday.
Howard's campus has been ringing with debate since a sweeping reassessment began last spring, after Dr. Jenifer took office in April. Some of the strongest criticism has come from the 1,200 full-time faculty members. Dr. Jenifer has said that no tenured professors will be let go, but some part-time instructors, particularly in the schools of education and human ecology, may be.
Even so, the University Senate supports Dr. Jenifer. "The president's report is an excellent solution and first step toward repositioning Howard University for the 21st century," the chairman of the senate Dr. Taft Broome, said in a statement yesterday. Many of the recommendations were first made in a report last fall by a study commission set up by Dr. Jenifer.
 
Decisive and Frank
 Dr. Jenifer's quick actions in reshaping the 124-year old university were prompted by a worsening financial situation and a growing sense that Howard had become too complacent. The efforts are considered exceptional in the degree to which Dr. Jenifer involved administrators, faculty and students, and in the frankness with which the university's shortcomings were discussed.
Most of the changes approved will be put into effect beginning next September, but it could be four years before they are completed. That gives students now enrolled in programs that are now targets of elimination a chance to complete their degrees.
The largest disruption will take place at the School of Human Ecology, with its 600 students, 69 percent of them women. Admissions standards there are among the lowest at the university, and faculty research projects were criticized by a university commission as not being "nationally significant."
The founding dean of the school, Cecile H. Edwards, who is now a professor there, called its closing "unconscionable."
 
After Intense Study
 Yesterday Dr. Jenifer said it had been "a very tough decision," but he said some programs would be shifted to other colleges. For example, he said, the program in interior design would be placed in the school of architecture.
Many of the changes approved by the trustees on Saturday were first proposed by a commission of 34 faculty members and community leaders, which studied all 18 of the university's schools and colleges and released a report last November.
After the report came out, some members of the university community expressed fears that Howard was abandoning its historic commitment to black people in order to become more like other large research universities.
The commission's chairman said Dr. Jenifer had honored the spirit of the commission's recommendations. "He told us to be bold, and we were," said Dr. LaSalle D. Leffall Jr., the commission chairman who also is chairman of the Department of Surgery at the Howard College of Medicine.
 
Medical College and Issue
 The medical college was one area where Dr. Jenifer substantially differed with the commission, which pronounced the college to be "in serious trouble," with a declining enrollment and a faculty it called "out of touch with the latest trends."
The commission at first recommended the university offer early retirement to the entire tenured staff, as a way of rejuvenating the leadership of the medical college. In a later report, the commission softened its criticism.
Dr. Jenifer made no substantial changes in the college, which has trained 22 percent of the nation's black doctors and 30 percent of its black dentists. "I did not agree with the commission analysis totally," Dr. Jenifer said. "The performance of the college may not be up to what we would like to see, but put in context, it's not bad."
 
S.A.T. Is Discussed
 Dr. Jenifer also declined to adopt the commission's recommendation that the minimum combined score on the S.A.T. for freshmen be raised to 1,000 by 1994. It is now about 800.
Dr. Jenifer said such a rigid standard would hurt minority students from poor urban school districts where such tests are not emphasized. Instead, he asked for the development of a Howard University Index, which would consider a student's high school grade-point average, class ranking and S.A.T. score for admissions decisions.
He also imposed a requirement that the average score on the index be raised every year for each school or college. That could eventually mean the average S.A.T. score in the Howard Index would be 1,000 anyway, Dr. Jenifer said. However students who did poorly on the test but had a good grade-point average or high class ranking still could be admitted.

HEADLINE: A Real Estate Fortune Dissolves

BYLINE: By RICHARD D. HYLTON

 BODY:
Daniel Mauck Galbreath had a reputation as a conservative real estate developer. But even his cautious stewardship could not save his business or the family fortune.
As head of the eighth-largest real estate development company in the country, he guides a family-run business that has erected skyscrapers for Borden Inc., the Mobil Corporation and Merrill Lynch & Company. And Forbes magazine put his wealth at about $340 million only a year ago. 
 But nearly empty office buildings, meager rents and $800 million in debts, much of which he cannot repay, have virtually wiped out his fortune.
 
Not Like Most Developers
 The Galbreath family, unlike most real estate developers in the 1980's, rarely constructed a building without first signing up a significant number of tenants. They would painstakingly line up a major corporation as an anchor tenant before breaking ground, take a fee for putting the project together and reduce their long-term risk by taking limited owership stakes in the buildings.
But the swift and severe drop in market values for commercial office buildings and the denial of bank credit to developers have doomed several Galbreath projects and taken nearly all of the family's wealth with them. Monument Tower, in Indianapolis, for example, was started in 1987 with a $181 million loan, but today the 48-story building, the tallest in the state, is valued at only about 60 percent of the original loan. With more than half of the space unleased and the loan in default, Citicorp the principal lender, is on the verge of seizing the property.
Because Mr. Galbreath personally guaranteed some of the loans, he is struggling to avoid bankruptcy for himself as well as his company, the Galbreath Company of Columbus, Ohio.
Even if he manages to stave off bankruptcy, and hold onto a piece of his empire, his estranged wife is seeking half of his fortune in a divorce battle that has raged for three years. If that were not enough, the grandchildren of his late stepmother are accusing him in Federal court of defrauding her estate of millions of dollars and valuable thoroughbred horses. He won the first round in court, but the case is on appeal.
"These are difficult times for my business and myself," the 62-year-old Mr. Galbreath said with a sigh recently.
The disintegration of the Galbreath family fortune illustrates both the severity of this real estate recession and how developers who were once lauded for their conservative financings and careful gambles are being swamped along with the highfliers.
"We didn't do anything different in the 1980's than we did in the 1970's or 1960's," Mr. Galbreath said. But when property values sank, and banks refused to refinance his loans, Mr. Galbreath and his company were ruinously squeezed.
The estimated worth of the Galbreath real estate empire, which began in the Great Depression when Mr. Galbreath's late father, John W. Galbreath, turned a profit selling foreclosed houses, is now between $40 million and $50 million, down from more than $250 million in 1989. (He says the $340 million estimate by Forbes was exaggerated.)
The $50 million includes primarily small slices of equity in real estate partnerships that have not soured, several houses, horses and two sprawling horse farms as well as various pieces of art. But against those assets, Mr. Galbreath is personally liable for about $50 million, meaning that his net worth, after liabilities, is now nil.
Gone, too, are some of the trappings of this wealth. The family owned the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team for 40 years and several noted race horses including Chateaugay and Proud Clarion, which both won the Kentucky Derby. Since this collapse, the family has parted with their private jet, a limousine in New York and put a limit to the free-spending ways at the 4,300-acre horse farm near the family's Columbus, Ohio home and a 650-acre farm near Lexington, Ky. (An annual practice of seeding the entire acreage with bluegrass has been dropped.)
 
Avoiding Bankruptcy
 If Mr. Galbreath is lucky, he will avoid bankruptcy by giving up big buildings like Monument Tower in Indianapolis to his lenders. He may also be able to hold onto his homes, including a home for the horse races in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., the apartment in Manhattan's River House and, at least for a while, the horse farms.
"At this point there is the objective to maintain the pride of the family by allowing them to keep certain things," said one of the participants in the Galbreath bank negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Several participants in the negotiations have said that the developer will be left with about $3 million in assets, made up mostly of property that he may have to sell.
While he shared some of the risks of building with partners, Mr. Galbreath, through his main development subsidiary, 100 East Broad Corporation, expanded rapidly during the go-go years of the 1980's and personally guaranteed more than $17 million of bank debt on some of his projects.
Besides Monument Tower, another doomed Galbreath project is Esperante, an office tower in West Palm Beach, Fla. It is almost 60 percent leased but Mr. Galbreath and his partners do not have enough cash to maintain debt payments until the rest of the building can be leased, a process that is likely to take years. That project will probably be taken by the banks. The loans on both projects are in default.
 
Casting Blame
 Like some many developers, Mr. Galbreath blames everybody but himself for much of his undoing. Bankers would not lend as freely as they once did; that is why he took the risk of personally backing some of the loans. Monument Tower would have been successful, he said, if Indianapolis had not been overrun with rival developers who threw up buildings and in the process pushed down rents. In West Palm Beach, many of the same factors hurt the Esperante project when another large building was built across the street.
"Indianapolis, for example, is big enough to handle our product; the problem is that some other people came in there and built also," Mr. Galbreath said recently.
The Galbreath company's main undoing came from the rapid deflation of real estate values and the sudden denial of credit to developers by lenders. In the past, the company would have been able to sell or refinance one of its properties to raise cash. But with the tightening of credit to real estate developers, the company has had to rely solely on the cash flow from its half-leased or half-built projects to make interest payments on its loans.
With new buildings very hard to lease at rates that cover construction and design costs, the Galbreath partnerships are stuck with properties that will probably not generate enough cash to cover their debt for several years.
"A year ago you had a lot of liquidity in the real estate markets, and if you were a creditor of Dan Galbreath's you weren't really worried," said a banker close to the negotiations. "That liquidity is gone."
By last summer the Galbreath cash squeeze had grown to crisis proportions. In July, Mr. Galbreath sought outside help by calling in a real estate workout specialist, Robert L. Sind of the Recovery Management Corporation, to to find a way to ease the cash shortage and reorganize the debts. But he may have arrived too late because by September Mr. Galbreath's company had begun to default on bank loans.
As is typical in workout negotiations, the smaller Galbreath creditors are jockeying to be bought out of the problem at the expense of the larger ones like Citicorp and Westinghouse Credit Corporation, which is owed about $30 million.
 
Asserting Leadership
 Citicorp, as the largest creditor, has begun asserting its leadership position within recent weeks and even tried to control all the cash flowing through the Galbreath enterprises, but that was rejected by the other creditors.
Banc One in Columbus and Bank Ohio have filed suits against Mr. Galbreath and his company. Those banks as well as several smaller creditors, including Chemical Bank, Barnett Banks, Huntington National Bank in Columbus, and Fifth Third Bank in Cincinnati can quickly force the developer to seek bankruptcy protection.
If any of the smaller creditors move to seize Galbreath assets, the developer will almost certainly seek bankruptcy protection and that is what the larger creditors are trying to avoid.
Whatever the final outcome of the talks, the people involved say there will not be very much left of the family's former life of luxury. The horse farms might eventually have to be sold, but no one expects a buyer to pay a price that would significantly improve Mr. Galbreath's financial position.
And then there is still the looming liability from the divorce, estate taxes to pay on his late father's estate, and messy accusations in the suit by the grandchildren. His cash outlay so far in the latter dispute is about $8 million.

HEADLINE: Virginia in Distress: Test for a New Governor -- A Special Report;
Can Austerity Be Wilder's Path to Power?

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM with MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

DATELINE: RICHMOND

 BODY:
L. Douglas Wilder has spent his 14 months as Governor of Virginia watching every politician's nightmare, a plunge in revenue.
Through the 1980's Virginia sizzled. As the economy and population boomed, the state government built new roads and expanded colleges, raised school standards and gave more help to the poor, elderly and mentally ill. Then in 1990, just as the nation's first elected black Governor took office, things fell flat. 
 Yet unlike other recession-stricken governors who are anguishing over the hard choices, Mr. Wilder seems almost to revel in his state's money woes. "I think it's fortunate," said the Governor, a Democrat, about his seemingly rotten timing. "It gives me an opportunity to do things I may never have had a chance to do in terms of streamlining government."
Refusing to discuss raising taxes as he slashes funds for state agencies, schools and local governments, he is unabashedly trying to transform fiscal distress into a political asset, and perhaps even a shot at the White House.
No political Hamlet, the 60-year-old Governor has already used his austerity platform to gain mention as a contender for the 1992 Democratic national ticket. He is often mentioned as an attractive Vice-Presidential candidate and some experts say his ambitions reach still higher.
"Clearly, the adamancy of his stand is linked to his Presidential ambitions," said Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.
In frequent talks around the country Mr. Wilder, a suave and confident figure, portrays himself as the leading edge of a "new mainstream" that rejects the old tax-and-spend mentality, instead pursuing "fiscal responsibility with compassion."
While this is hardly an original slogan, even for a Democrat, Mr. Wilder has been more aggressive than most, both in trumpeting austerity at home and in accusing the Bush Administration and many Democrats of profligacy.
In Virginia, Mr. Wilder's first principle in coping with the budget crisis has been a rigid pledge of no new taxes; he has even held a $200 million reserve fund as a cushion against surprises. He has cut spending substantially but also used a host of time-honored tactics to dull or postpone the pain: accounting gimmicks to create spending money, construction delays; passing of burdens to city and county governments, and putting off the worst hardships until next year.
His gamble is that an economic recovery will soon begin to ease the pressure. In any case, he does not have to worry about re-election as Governor when his term ends in 1993: state law forbids it.
Mr. Wilder's budgetary approach has generally gone over well in Virginia. But some Virginians are beginning to ask whether the state will pay a price for his national ambitions. "It will be a great 20-second sound bite -- he's the guy who did a better job than Mario Cuomo," said State Senator Joseph V. Gartlan Jr., a Democrat who has been one of the Governor's sharpest critics. "This could take him through 1992 and the Democratic Convention, but then we've got to come back and run the state."
 
Governor Sees Stand As Guidepost for Future
 In an interview in the Virginia Statehouse, a building designed by Thomas Jefferson that exudes the dual histories of the nation and the Confederacy, Mr. Wilder often waxed Reaganesque as he insisted that his measures were good for the state. "I'm not interested in just balancing the budget," he said. "We want to eliminate waste and spending wherever we can, so that when times do get better we don't go back to business as usual."
The recession hit Virginia in an era of dramatic growth and change, as its profile, once dominated by tobacco farms and coal mines, became more urban and suburban, requiring big increases in government services. But its social services, especially for the poor, are still relatively low.
Virginians are not heavily taxed by national standards; Virginia ranked 43d among the 50 states in 1989 in state and local taxes as a proportion of personal income. But in a theme he says Republican Presidents have only mouthed as they ran up deficits and taxes, Mr. Wilder argued that higher taxes would hurt an overburdened middle class.
Virginia's budget shortage is serious, though not as deep as those facing several other states, including New York. It amounts to 15 percent of planned expenditures over two years from the $12 billion general fund, which includes most discretionary spending.
The Governor, who served in the State Assembly for 16 years before his election as Lieutenant Governor in 1985, is especially proud of the $200 million "rainy day fund" he set up -- money he has insisted on keeping in reserve on the ground that things may get still worse.
"He understands symbolic politics very well," said Robert D. Holsworth, a political scientist at Virginia Commonwealth University. "He can claim he maintained a reserve fund even in times of stress. I don't think people are interested in the details of the budget."
According to polls by Mason-Dixon Opinion Research, the proportion of Virginians rating his job performance excellent or good has declined slightly, to 44 percent in January from 48 percent last summer, The margin of sampling error was plus or minus three percentage points.
Mr. Wilder, who is from Richmond, won election in 1989 with barely more than 50 percent of the vote, including 41 percent of the white vote, an exceptional showing for a black candidate. He began his political career as as a strong liberal but became more conservative in the 1980's as his sights shifted to statewide office.
Virginia operates on a two-year budget, which has given Mr. Wilder more time than most beleaguered governors to ease in cuts, concentrating them in the second fiscal year of the cycle, which begins this July. He was also able to find relatively painless ways to offset about a third of the deficit, like transferring lottery profits from construction projects to general spending, and raising the assumptions about future interest earnings from the employee retirement fund, allowing reduced current contributions by the state.
Still, two-thirds of the shortage, which totals more than $2 billion for the two-year cycle, will be met by spending cuts, said Paul W. Timmreck, Secretary of Finance. State agency budgets are being reduced by amounts ranging from 10 percent to 25 percent; salaries have been frozen, programs curbed and at least 660 workers, out of a force of more than 100,000, will be laid off. A college and university system that is the state's pride is in turmoil, with schools forced to delay needed construction, cut student aid, raise tuition and reduce course offerings.
The Governor has taken relatively little from welfare programs, which he calls the "compassion" side of his equation, though payments have been frozen. But state cuts have put an added burden on county and city governments, which also face declining revenue and often depend heavily on the state to finance schools, law enforcement, health programs and other services.
 
Criticism and Sympathy From State Educators
 School and university officials have been among the most vocal critics. "I understand what he is doing politically," said Michael G. Basham, Superintendent of Schools in Scott County, a poor Appalachian region where schools are struggling to improve. "But I don't much care about his national aspirations, I care about the kids in Scott County. Personally, I think Virginia has got to do much more for education, and taxes have got to be raised."
Local officials and educators around the state, in interviews, expressed deep concerns about the prospects for essential services and education. But even many who are directly affected express sympathy for the Governor's aproach.
Frank Horton, chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Russell County, also in the Appalachians, spoke sadly of the reductions under way in "programs we struggled 30 years to build," like music and art classes, guidance counselors and physical education in elementary school. "We're trying to cut back community services to bare bones and give the savings to schools," he said.
Still, "no one envies the Governor's position," said Mr. Horton, a Democrat, adding, "I think in general he's doing what he feels is right."
Here in Richmond, the capital, which faces many typical problems of urban poverty, the fall in state aid and local revenue has forced a freeze on hiring and other economies. The city's Department of Social Services has been unable to fill 40 vacancies in a staff of 520 in a year when economic distress has expanded its clients by 10 percent.
But the elected black political leadership, which controls city government, has generally supported the Governor's policies, although some black church leaders and others say he gives too little attention to the poor.
Sometimes sliding into a folksy drawl, Mr. Wilder makes it all sound easy. "I don't mind being a bad guy at all," he said, dismissing the complaints of public employees, teachers, college administrators and local officials as special pleading.
"There has been no serious curtailment in the delivery of services," he said. "People are saying it's calamity and woe. But how can we find all this to cut in state government and they can't find it in some local government?"
The real test is yet to come, as the steeper cuts of the 1992 fiscal year pull counties and school systems through a much tighter wringer and they have to choose between cuts in services or increases in taxes.
Some of the consequences may only be felt over time, critics say, long after Mr. Wilder has left the scene.
Gerald L. Baliles, the Democrat who preceded Mr. Wilder as Governor, says the state's continued prosperity requires more investments in new highways, port equipment, schools, prisons, mental health programs and other social services.
"If these cuts are sustained over time and made deeper," he said, "it will definitely affect the quality of our education, it will impair the ability of the state to compete in this country and in world markets, it will definitely have an impact on care of the elderly and the mentally ill and on prisons."
 
Unloading the Guns Of Republican Rivals
 For now, Mr. Wilder finds himself in a comfortable political place. Virginia Republicans, unable to attack him as a free-spending liberal, have been undercut on a potent issue, although they say that some of the money produced by Mr. Wilder's shifts in funds and his accounting measures are dangerous departures from fiscal integrity.
"He says he won't raise taxes, which is commendable," said Stephen D. Haner, executive director of the state legislature's Joint Republican Caucus. "But he's using every other despicable thing in the annals of budget chicanery."
Liberal Democrats have been reluctant to push for new taxes, especially since all members of the State Legislature face re-election this year. In February the Democratic-controlled Legislature essentially bought the Governor's budget proposals, although it restored some education funds.
Through his actions and those of his advisers, Mr. Wilder has entered the strange domain of presumed national candidates.
Some political experts have questioned the depth of his experience, an issue that causes Paul Goldman, chairman of the Virginia Democratic Party and a close adviser of the Governor, to bristle. "How come first-term governors in California and New York are considered Presidential timber and not others?" he asked. "We're not chopped liver down here."
Mr. Wilder says he has "no plans" to run for national office. "I think Cuomo says he has no plans to have plans," he said, enjoying the chance to tweak a potential rival but also the potential leader, in some visions, of a Cuomo-Wilder ticket. "But I just have no plans."
"I do intend to be very involved on the issues that affect the American people," Mr. Wilder added. "I'll be pushing fiscal responsibility, yes sir."

HEADLINE: Still Hooked on Oil

BYLINE: By Al Gore; Al Gore, Democrat of Tennessee, is the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on science, technology and space.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 The Bush Administration's new national energy strategy proposes to deal with our energy crisis the way we dealt with Saddam Hussein before he invaded Kuwait: by pretending the problem will go away if we humor it. What we need instead is the resolve and leadership with which President Bush dealt with Saddam Hussein after he invaded Kuwait. 
I voted to authorize force in the Persian Gulf, and I agree with the President that this conflict has been about values far more important than oil, but I do not want to see an increase in our dependence on the oil underneath that chronically unstable region. Yet according to bipartisan analysis, the Bush strategy will result in an overall increase in U.S. oil imports, from approximately 50 percent to 60 percent when the plan is fully implemented by 2030.
 The Administration argues that we will be better off than we would be otherwise, but that ignores alternative policies -- energy efficiency, conservation and renewable sources -- that could dramatically reduce our dependence on imported oil and fossil fuels generally. Mr. Bush proposes instead sacrificing one of our last, most pristine wilderness areas -- the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge -- for an uncertain oilfield that would provide, at best, a few months' supply at our current rate of consumption.
 And while President Bush claims that the answer is the marketplace, and that the unaided forces of supply and demand can solve the problem for us, his plan offers not a single proposal for addressing the enormous hidden costs of burning and wasting such vast quantities of fossil fuels. What about the cost to our national security of increased dependence on Middle Eastern oil? Where is it addressed in the market?
 What about the hidden costs that burning more oil imposes on the environment? Where are they addressed in the market? Global warming may be hard to think about, but it is rapidly being recognized as one of the most serious problems humans face. The White House effort to pretend it does not exist reminds me of the point made by scientist Carl Sagan, when he quotes a song by Dire Straits: "Denial ain't just a river in Egypt."
 Cheap oil and energy conservation are not naturally linked. The new energy marketplace -- itself distorted by the billions we have just correctly invested in restoring stability to the world's largest reserves of oil -- will discourage investment in alternative energy sources and dampen consumer interest in greater energy efficiency.
 The victory of capitalism over Communism in the philosophical war of the last 75 years has been as decisive as the victory by the coalition against the forces of Saddam Hussein. In the aftermath of both victories, we need to focus on what comes next. As for the economic system we advocate for ourselves and all the world, it is time to address forthrightly what economists call the "externalities" -- those hidden costs we would rather forget.
 With oil prices dropping, there is no better time for a bolder energy policy. We should ask the President for political leadership and the kind of courage he showed in the gulf in order to accelerate the development of energy alternatives, confront our addiction to fossil fuels, especially foreign oil, and measure the full costs of the energy choices we make.
 The President's skills, personal experience and most trusted advisers are in the realm of foreign policy. Thus far, he has not shown corresponding strength in meeting the pressing needs of this country closer to home. Perhaps that is why his domestic policy decisions seem to be so vulnerable to short-term political considerations. Whatever the reason, he discarded the recommendations of his own Energy Secretary and adopted a proposal driven above all by the desire to avoid discomfiting the voters for the next 20 months. But what about the next 20 years?
 On energy policy, the President misreads the mood of the nation. In the Persian Gulf, we showed our remarkable ability as a nation to pull together in a crisis. Americans will show the same determination to avoid another Middle East crisis if their leaders address these issues forcefully, honestly and now.

HEADLINE: U.N. Group Condemns Burmese on Rights Record

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 6

 BODY:
The United Nations Human Rights Commission has voted unanimously in secret session in Geneva to condemn the military Government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, for rights violations as a result of a confidential report prepared by a United Nations inspector who recently visited the country.
The report said that the nation's military authorities continued to detain political opponents and that the authorities had failed to answer "serious and persistent allegations of torture and mistreatment" of these prisoners.Burmese rulers have also made no preparations for carrying out their promise to return the country to democratic, civilian rule, the report said. 
 The Burmese Government has made no response to the condemnation, which took place Feb. 26.
The 25-page confidential report was written by Sadako Ogata of Japan, who was sent to investigate human rights in Myanmar last November by the Human Rights Commission. Mrs. Ogata was later named United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
As a resut of Mrs. Ogata's findings, the 43-nation Human Rights Commission, which monitors the way governments treat their citizens, voted the condemnation and agreed to send another inspector to check on Myanmar's human rights record next year, diplomats and human rights workers said.
The Commission hears complaints about human rights abuses, with its confidential meetings intended to give members a chance to persuade governments to change policies without losing face. The group's annual six-week meeting in Geneva is to end Friday.
At the same confidential session, the Commission also condemned the governments of the Sudan and Chad for widespread human rights violations and decided to examine their records again next year, officials said.
But the organization agreed to stop monitoring Zaire's human rights record after receiving promises from the Government to treat its citizens better, the officials said.
In her report on Myanmar, Mrs. Ogata said Gen. Saw Maung's Government, which calls itself the State Law and Order Restoration Council, continued to detain "a large number of persons, including prominent leaders of political parties," especially those from the National League for Democracy, which won the elections last year.
In May 1990, candidates of the National League for Democracy won more than 80 percent of the seats in apparently free elections for a National Assembly. The results stunned the military, which has not turned over power to the assembly or allowed it to meet. The vote was the first since the military took power in a coup in 1962.
Mrs. Ogata wrote of restrictions on individual freedom including a night-time curfew, a ban on public meetings and the continued shutdown of all universities, depriving some 120,000 students of education. Criticism of the Government remains banned by law, she said.
Although the military government has made official commitments to drafting a new Constitution and introducing democratic government, Mrs. Ogata said it had no timetable and refuses to open a serious dialogue with the country's political parties.

U.S. Weighs Sanctions
 WASHINGTON, March 6 (Reuters) -- The United States is considering imposing economic sanctions against Myanmar, Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon told the House East Asian and Pacific subcommittee today.
"We are currently considering what economic sanctions against Burma might be appropriate and will notify Congress promptly of the outcome of our assessment," Mr. Solomon said.
Congress passed an amendment to the 1990 trade act calling on President Bush to impose economic sanctions if he could not certify that Myanmar had made reforms and improved its performance on narcotics suppression.
"Burma cannot meet these requirements and we have so informed Congress," said Mr. Solomon, who said the United States has ended all forms of economic aid to Myanmar and was urging other countries to do the same.

Bank Regulators Losing in Court

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne

 BODY:
A SERIES of Federal court decisions has held that regulators were overzealous in seizing some failed banks and savings and loans and that the Government could be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages to investors.
In different cases, judges found that regulators overstepped their authority by reneging on promises to buyers of troubled savings and loans, by pushing healthy banks into insolvency, or by illegally trying to squeeze millions of dollars from owners of failed financial institutions.
Only a score of such lawsuits have been brought against the Government -- a minuscule number compared with the thousands of failed banks and savings and loans seized by regulators each year -- and many rulings are being appealed. But the trend has been against the Government, and some think it points to a disturbing pattern of regulators trying to reduce the cost of Federal bailouts at the expense of the law.
The validity of that interpretation, however, is still a matter of debate.
Rosemary Stewart, a lawyer with Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue in Washington and former director of enforcement for the Office of Thrift Supervision, thinks the courts have recognized that regulators "are going too far."
"In a vengence mentality after the savings and loan crisis," she said, "the Government is trying to get everything it possibly can."
But Alfred J. T. Byrne, general counsel of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Resolution Trust Corporation, feels the court decisions "reflect either a misunderstanding or a misapplication of the new law, or both."
"We do not draw any conclusion that there is a tide flowing against the Government agencies," he said.
No one contests the power of regulators to seize assets of insolvent banks and savings and loans in order to protect depositors' money. But several cases turn on interpretations of the savings and loan industry bailout legislation enacted by Congress in August 1989.
Two cases test the retroactive application of that law. They involve the seizure by regulators in March 1989 of several healthy Texas banks after their parent banks, MBank in Dallas and the Texas American Bank in Fort Worth, became insolvent.
Regulators pushed more than a dozen healthy subsidiary banks of the two companies into insolvency by failing to fully repay loans that the subsidiary banks made to the parents. Two courts have said that the subsidiaries are owed full payment under then-prevailing banking laws, but the Government is appealing on the ground that the 1989 bailout law permited only partial repayment.
The F.D.I.C. has since lobbied successfully to have the 1989 bailout law permit unequal payments to creditors of failed banks.
In another group of cases, regulators' attempts to abrogate concessions given to entice investors to buy failing savings and loans have been challenged. Eight of these cases have gone against the Government, four have gone in its favor and, in two others, the court said it had no jurisdiction.
The Government has lost three other cases that involved attempts by regulators to collect money from owners of failed savings and loans by forcing them to put up new capital after institutions were declared insolvent.
The 1989 bailout law is also being questioned in a group of cases involving concessions given by regulators to buyers of troubled savings and loans before the law's enactment. Regulators contend that the new law permits them to disregard these concessions, which are generally forbearances allowing newly acquired savings and loans to operate with lower capital requirements or more liberal lending policies than permitted by law.
One of the best known in this group of cases involves Far West Federal Bank, a Portland, Ore., savings and loan that regulators sold to investors in 1987. In return for investing some $27 million of capital, the Government gave the new investors 10 years to meet capital requirements and approved a liberal lending policy.
But with the 1989 bailout law, regulators told Far West that it was out of compliance with the law and that its owners faced daily fines of up to $1 million. Far West quickly complied, but as a result began losing money; officers and depositors fled and its balance sheet shrank.
Far West's owners now say the Government can take the institution back -- they just want their $27 million returned, along with $100 million in damages. United States District Judge Owen M. Panner agreed, ruling that regulators violated Fifth Amendment guarantees against illegal seizure of property and that their action was "economic suicide" for Far West." Damages have yet to be set.
A final batch of rulings against the Government involves attempts by regulators to collect money by enforcing capital requirements after a savings and loan failed. One leading case involves a Texas company named Tetco, which in 1983 bought a Texas savings and loan in San Antonio called the Bexar Savings Association. To get deposit insurance, Tetco agreed to certain capital levels and to add more when necessary. Over time, Tetco sunk some $25 million into Bexar.
Bexar, however, suffered losses and was declared insolvent and seized by regulators in February 1989, wiping out Tetco's investment. The Government then sued Tetco for $558 million -- the amount needed for Bexar to meet its capital requirements if it were still alive. But United States District Judge Lucius D. Bunton in San Antonio dismissed the Government's claim, as did judges in two similar cases elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Surveys Find Americans Satisfied With Quality of Health Services

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Although many consumers are worried about the cost of medical care, results of two surveys that were announced Monday found Americans are generally satisfied with the quality of health services.
Based on telephone interviews in six countries last fall, one of the poll-takers, Louis Harris & Associates, said Canadians were even more likely than Americans to say they were "very satisfied" with medical services. Canadian and American consumers differed as to which types of services were satisfactory. A separate poll of Americans by the Gallup Organization reported similar results. 
 Canada has a national health care system that is financed by taxpayers, and doctors' incomes are lower, on average, than in the United States.
"Nobody in either country hates the care they are getting," said Robert J. Blendon, chairman of health policy at Harvard University's School of Public Health. "It is the payment system that makes Americans angry."
The Commerce Department estimates that national spending on health care will be $756.3 billion in 1991, $80 billion more than last year.
 
Domestic Effect Feared
 Thomas O. Pyle, chief executive of the Harvard Community Health Plan, a health maintenance organization based in Brookline, Mass., that sponsored the Harris survey, said, "The increase alone would be greater than the estimated cost of Desert Storm." He said rising medical spending "is beginning to cut into our ability as a nation to educate people and deal with other pressing problems."
More than 70 percent of the 1,006 Americans surveyed by Harris said too much is spent on hospitals and doctors, while fewer than 25 percent of the 1,026 Canadians questioned said doctors and hospitals receive too much.
Polls of 1,000 people typically have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
Sixty percent of Canadians and 55 percent of Americans said they were "very satisfied" with their health systems. Forty-five percent were very satisfied in West Germany, 39 percent in Britain, 28 percent in Sweden, and 12 percent in Japan.
Health care spending in the United States is the highest in the world, $2,051 per capita, followed by Canada with $1,483. Among the six countries, life expectancy is highest in Japan and Canada, at 79 years, and lowest in the United States, 75.6 years.
Only 32 percent of Canadians were very satisfied with the waiting periods they faced for surgery for conditions that were not life-threatening. Fifty percent of Americans said access to such surgery was very satisfactory. Fifty-eight percent of Americans and 48 percent of Canadians said they were very satisfied with the availability of high-technology tests, procedures and equipment.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Wheat Off After 4-Day Rise; Livestock and Meat Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wheat prices fell slightly yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade as profit taking ended a four-day advance that lifted the value of a bushel of wheat by as much as 10 percent. Other grain and soybean futures also finished mostly lower.
On other commodity markets, coffee futures surged; energy futures were mostly lower; precious metals rose, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. 
 Wheat futures settled 1 3/4 cents lower to 1/2 cent higher, with the contract for delivery in March at $2.74 a bushel; corn was 1 3/4 cents lower to 1/4 cent higher, with March at $2.46 1/4 a bushel; oats were 1/4 cent to 1/2 cent lower, with March at $1.20 1/4 a bushel, and soybeans were 1 1/2 cents to 5 cents lower, with March at $5.93 3/4 a bushel.
The grain markets opened higher, but the rally faltered after soybeans for March delivery failed to rise above $6 a bushel, an important psychological barrier.
Analysts had predicted a downward correction in the wheat market, which began its run-up last Thursday from $2.52 1/4 a bushel for March deliveries. The March wheat contract peaked at $2.77 1/2 in intraday trading yesterday.
The surge represented a revival for wheat prices, which fell to four-and-a-half-year lows early this year in response to slack export demand and a bumper world crop.
 
Coffee at 5-Month Highs
 Coffee futures soared to five-month highs on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange as dwindling supplies sent roasters to the futures market to lock in prices.
Oil prices retreated on the New York Mercantile Exchange, snapping a seven-day rise as traders speculated that OPEC's attempts to cut production of crude might not proceed smoothly. But near-term gasoline futures posted their eighth consecutive move higher, reflecting concern over shrinking domestic supplies and refinery capacity as the summer driving season approaches.
Precious metals rallied as spot silver neared 4 cents an ounce on hopes of an economic recovery, and platinum recovered about a third of Tuesday's decline.
Livestock and meat futures were narrowly mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in U.S. Trading After Earlier Gains Abroad

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell against other currencies in late profit taking in New York yesterday after posting earlier gains overseas.
Gold advanced in New York, rising $1.20 on the Commodity Exchange to close at $365.90 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $366.25, up $2.25. 
 Analysts said the dollar rose abroad and in early New York trading after the Federal Reserve Board's chairman, Alan Greenspan, said that the recession was not deepening and that the economy might improve in coming months.
"What that suggests to the financial markets is that the Fed is unlikely to ease any time in the near future and, consequently, short-term interest rates would stop moving down," said Kevin Logan, chief economist with the Swiss Bank Corporation in New York.
 
'Risky Day to Have a Position'
 Profit taking set in after the dollar failed to rise above 1.55 German marks in New York, Mr. Logan said.
An important economic indicator, the February unemployment report, is being released tomorrow, and traders did not want to leave themselves open to sharp losses if the data were weaker than expected.
"It's always a risky day to have a position," Mr. Logan said. "The data's so volatile."
The dollar closed at 1.5380 German marks in New York, down from 1.5440 late Tuesday. In earlier European trading, the dollar rose to 1.5405 marks from 1.5325.
The British pound gained against the dollar in New York, rising to $1.8950, from $1.8913 late Tuesday. Earlier in London, sterling fell to $1.8895 from $1.9015.
The dollar also lost ground against the Japanese yen, falling to 135.70 yen in New York, from 136.30 late Tuesday. Overnight in Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.67 yen to close at 136.55 yen.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those late Tuesday, included: 1.3390 Swiss francs, down from 1.34545; 5.2360 French francs, down from 5.2590; 1,148.00 Italian lire, down from 1,153.50, and 1.15855 Canadian dollars, up from 1.15695.
Other late dollar rates in Europe included: 1.3450 Swiss francs, up from 1.3385; 5.2470 French francs, up from 5.2210; 1.7368 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7275; 1,151.75 Italian lire, up from 1,144.00, and 1.1598 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1542.
Silver advanced to $3.868 an ounce on the Commodity Exchange, from $3.856 late Tuesday. In earlier London trading, silver rose to a late bid price of $3.93, from $3.86 late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Awards Grants to Aid Technology

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
The Commerce Department announced $9 million in matching grants to companies yesterday that are designed to foster innovative civilian technologies and restore American competitiveness.
The grants are part of a program that some in Congress and industry hope will grow into a larger effort by the Government to help United States technology become more competitive internationally. 
 The 11 grant winners include large companies, like the Bell Laboratories unit of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, and start-up manufacturers like Hampshire Instruments Inc. of Marlborough, Mass., a maker of an inexpensive X-ray lithography system.
 
Many Activities Supported
 The technologies given grants involve the manufacture of inexpensive flat-panel display screens, advanced X-ray lithography research, a project to provide an economical solution to correcting errors in precision machine tools, and advanced superconductor research.
The Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation of Austin, Tex., was awarded a grant for a radical new form of computer memory based on holographic images in photorefractive crystals.
George A. Uriano, director of the the Advanced Technology Program of the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology, said the agency was financing projects that fall between basic research and technology development.
"There is still quite a debate going on," he said. "Clearly it's perceived to be a different type of program that would help to redefine the Government role."
The Bush Administration has been opposed to providing help to specific industries like semiconductors or television manufacturers, which have asked for support to develop technologies that could compete with Japanese and European companies.
Some members of Congress have called for the creation of a civilian counterpart to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a Pentagon agency that will spend almost $1.4 billion on advanced research.
The debate reached a crucial point last April, after Craig I. Fields, the director of the agency, called Darpa, was removed in a dispute over its role. Dr. Fields had advocated using agency financing to support civilian technology.
 
Matching Funds Required
 The companies that received the Commerce Department awards are required to provide a matching amount of their own monwey. Mr. Uriano said that the program had received 250 proposals and that winners had been judged on scientific, technical and commercial merit.
Congress has allocated an additional $35.9 million for grants this year and President Bush has requested an additional $35.9 million for the fiscal year 1992, Mr. Uriano said.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Money Market Fund Yields Are Mixed, Altering Trend

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields of money market funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report were mixed in the week that ended yesterday, the first such week after several weeks of declines.
According to analysts at Donoghue's, the Federal Reserve's effort to counter the recession with interest rate cuts is nearing an end. They see the question now as whether the central bank will have to ease more to get the economy moving. 
 Walter S. Frank, Donoghue's chief economist, said he believed the Fed might have to ease further, but that the major easing moves were over. Money market fund yields, he said, will now probably fall into a drifting pattern with a slight downward tendency, but with no probability of moving higher.
 
Longer Holding Period
 Tax-exempt money funds reported that the average number of days that securities were being held in portfolios in the week was up three days, to 51. Assets declined a modest $277 million, to $91.5 billion. Analysts said a potential existed for tax-exempt assets to decline further as a strong stock market competed for funds.
The average seven-day compounded tax-exempt yield for the week rose by 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 4.14 percent, while the 30-day compounded average yield fell 12 basis points, to 4.23 percent.
The taxable equivalent of the current seven-day tax-exempt yield is 5.75 percent for those in the 28 percent tax bracket, and 6.17 percent in the 33 percent bracket.
 
Calvert Has Top Return
 Of the tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million that are monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, the Calvert Tax Free Reserves Money Market fund produced the best return on investment, with a yield of 5.20 percent. The fund is managed by the Calvert Group in Washington.
Assets of taxable funds rose by $1.2 billion in the week, to $456.6 billion, a record. The cash inflow was all into consumer funds, where assets rose by $1.8 billion, to $345.9 billion. About $200 million of the cash flow to consumer funds went into Treasury and government-agency funds. Institutional-fund assets declined by $600 million, to $110.7 billion.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell by 11 basis points, to 6.38 percent, and the 30-day yield fell 13 basis points, to 6.54 percent.
The Strong Money Market fund paid the best return on investment for the week, with a yield of 7.28 percent. The fund is managed by Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management Inc. in Milwaukee.
By comparison, bank money market accounts, which compete with the money funds and are included in The Bank Rate Monitor national index, showed an average rate of return unchanged in the week, at 5.62 percent.

HEADLINE: International Energy Agency Ends Emergency Oil Sales

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, March 6

 BODY:
The International Energy Agency, a group of 21 industrial nations, decided today to end emergency sales of oil from government strategic reserves, a program instituted to insure sufficient supplies during the Persian Gulf war.
In suspending the program, officials of the Paris-based agency said they were confident that oil supplies would remain in balance with demand for the short term, even if it took a long time for Kuwaiti and Iraqi oilfields to resume production. 
 "The agency at the moment does not see any immediate problem on the supply front," said Geoffrey Chipperfield, a British energy official who is chairman of the agency's governing board.
Under the emergency plan, which took effect on Jan. 17, member governments made available an extra two million barrels of oil a day from their reserves, and took conservation measures to reduce consumption by an additional 400,000 barrels a day.
The plan was the first time in the agency's 17-year history that the governments of the industrial world used an emergency program of drawing from reserves to calm the markets in the case of supply disruptions.
"The plan certainly was a success," Mr. Chipperfield said. "There was no shortage of supplies. The markets were reassured."
 
OPEC Dialogue Sought
 Oil analysts say the agency's plan of releasing stocks -- along with the success of the anti-Iraq coalition in defending Saudi oilfields -- helped drive down oil prices from about $30 a barrel after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 to less than $20 a barrel at present.
Mr. Chipperfield said his agency, which represents industrial oil-importing nations, would soon consider beginning a dialogue with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
OPEC officials have long urged a dialogue, with some members suggesting that industrial nations might help build and finance new refineries, while OPEC members promised to insure a steady supply of oil.
According to the agency's monthly oil market report, which was released today, world oil consumption -- excluding demand in what had been the Soviet bloc -- will be 54.3 million barrels a day, up from 53.7 million in last year's first quarter. The agency said oil supplies would be 53.5 million barrels a day in the first quarter.
This means that oil stocks will be reduced by about 800,000 barrels a day, which agency officials said was not at all worrisome.
Quincy Lumsden, the agency's chief economist, predicted that in the 1990's, world oil consumption would increase by 1.5 percent to 2 percent a year.

U.S. Reserve Sales

DALLAS, March 6 (Special to The New York Times) -- In the United States, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has not accepted bids for oil since it signed contracts in the first week of February to ship 17.3 million barrels of crude to 13 buyers. Deliveries began last month from three of the reserve's six locations along the Gulf Coast and will be completed by the end of March, said a senior official who asked not to be identified.

HEADLINE: Rally Isn't Curing Wall St. Blues

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
After months of gloom, investors returned to buying stocks with a passion in the first months of 1991, sending the Dow Jones industrial average climbing at a giddy rate -- a rise of more than 500 points since mid-January. Investors, who had pulled back from the market as losses spread in 1990, are suddenly making money again.
So why is the joy so restrained on Wall Street? 
 One big reason is that most investment houses are now in so many other lines of business that they no longer look solely to the stock market for their profits. In the last decade, firms have expanded their businesses in mergers and acquisitions, securities underwriting and bond trading. That means that because of their expansion, firms like Merrill Lynch & Company and Shearson Lehman Brothers, which depended mostly on their retail brokerage operations a decade ago, have much less in profits to gain or lose on daily stock trading.
 
Diversification Costs
 Much of the expansion has cost Wall Street firms so dearly that they have yet to recover, even as the stock market has rallied. Meantime, the firms, and their well-heeled parents, have to keep paying the overhead and other expenses to stay in those businesses. That quickly sops up revenue, especially when it comes from primarily one source.
"In order to have reasonable returns and pay people a reasonable amount, you have to have a big year across the board, in every business," said Michael D. Madden, the co-head of investment banking at Lehman Brothers. "That is why people aren't kicking up their heels."
Yesterday, the stock market gave investors even more cause for joy. The Dow briefly spilled over 3,000 twice before easing to 2,973.27, up 0.75. [Page D12.]
Of course, with Big Board trading volume topping 200 million shares several times this year, many firms have made money from increased commissions, a greater value for their own portfolios and trading profits. And while that makes executives at these firms happy, they have also painfully learned in the last four years that what goes up can come crashing down.
"You're only talking about a change in business for a few weeks," said Donald Marron, chairman of the Paine Webber Group, "and you need a period of time before you get an emotional change. All of us have been conditioned in the last few years to brief flurries of improvements followed by declines, so there is a wait-and-see attitude now."
On a pretax basis, Wall Street has earned $250 million to $350 million since the start of the year, or as much as $2 billion at an annualized rate, said Michael Lipper, president of the Lipper Analytical Securities Corporation. But Mr. Lipper said the windfall had not been distributed evenly, with the retail brokerages with low expenses profiting most.
A report sent this month by the Securities Industry Association, a trade group, to the heads of Wall Street securities firms indicated the change from last year. An informal survey by the group found retail business had jumped between 20 percent and 40 percent since the allied air strikes in the Persian Gulf began in mid-January. Profits from trading, a business that thrives on large movements in the market, also appeared to be good.
"With costs squeezed down, many of you should be experiencing a most welcome profit improvement," the report said.
But at the large investment houses, the money being made on Wall Street this year is not nearly enough to pay for all the employees, office space and technology their businesses require.
 
Takeovers and Underwriting
 Take the business of mergers and acquisitions, which fueled Wall Street's boom in the 1980's. In the first two months of this year, only a total of $16.1 billion in takeover deals was announced, according to the Securities Data Corporation. That is down significantly from the $29 billion announced in the first two months of last year, and the $40.1 billion in the first two months of 1989.
Fees to investment banks for underwriting securities have also fallen. According to Securities Data, Wall Street received $313.6 million in fees in the first two months of this year for underwritings, compared with $338 million in the first two months of 1990 and $401.9 million in the first two months of 1989.
That puts the high-cost businesses, like investment banking, under increased pressure to pay their own freight.
"A few weeks of even a really good stock market have not convinced people that the long-term problems they have seen in the business" are all behind them, said George M. Cohen, a partner who focuses on banking and securities at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton.
 
Tension on the Job
 With Wall Street entering its fourth year of recession -- last year the industry lost as much as $500 million by some estimates -- few people believe the troubled times are over. Fears of losing a job, declining salaries and bonuses, a tougher enviroment for doing business because of increased competition and the almost universal belief that there are too many firms to survive have made Wall Street an increasingly tense place to work.
Wall Street's problem is expense -- many securities firms have simply been spending too much to make strong profits. Even after the dismissals of thousands of employees and pay cuts for others, many executives say that painful times will continue until the industry transforms itself into a smaller business.
"The cost structure of Wall Street has been so dramatically increased over the past decade that even though you may see a minor increase in profitability, it is not enough to recapitalize the industry," said Felix Rohatyn, the investment banker who works with Lazard, Freres & Company. "There still has to be a real re-examination, probably by each firm, about what is its business, and maybe a redefinition of what the business is all about."
 
60,000 Jobs Lost
 Since the stock market crash in 1987, such re-examinations have resulted in the elimination of about 60,000 jobs. Dismissals became virtually a daily ritual on Wall Street last fall and have continued even during the market rally.
"People have been very shaken by what has happened in the past three or four years and realize that there is a lot of work ahead," said Jean-Louis Lelogeais, a management consultant who specializes in capital markets with the consulting firm of Booz Allen & Hamilton.
The retrenchment of Wall Street has continued in recent weeks. Indeed, some of Wall Street's most venerable firms have been shrinking their payrolls. Goldman, Sachs & Company has let at least 20 people go in the last few weeks, according to Wall Street executives and search firms that are now trying to place the former employees.
"Even with the rally, people working at some firms are worried about their jobs, they are worried about their friends' jobs, or they are doing the firing themselves," said Thomas W. Strauss, the president of Salomon Brothers Inc. "It is not a period where happiness is going to return overnight."
Wall Street's overpopulation problem has other consequences. With so many deal makers chasing so few deals, some firms have been slashing their prices, cutting into the profit on transactions, a tactic called narrowing the spreads.
"Since you still have lots of people around competing, the spreads are very, very tight," Mr. Lelogeais of Booz Allen said. "When you plot the continued spread compression against volume of business, even when the volume comes up, the revenue can come down."
For example, Mr. Madden of Shearson said that for a securities firm to gross $100 million from underwriting corporate debt, which used to be fairly common, the amount of debt issued would have to total at least $150 billion. "That's about equal to the entire Federal deficit," he said.
 
Disappointing Bonuses
 For those who have kept their jobs, pay has been a second focus of concern. A large number of Wall Street employees are finding that their 1990 bonuses, many of which were awarded in the last two months and can constitute a huge proportion of annual salary, had shrunk substantially.
One firm with grumbling workers is Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, which analysts said would be giving out the worst bonuses on Wall Street. Employees said the bonuses were as much as 60 percent lower than the previous year. The firm will also give part of its bonuses in securities, which some employees there have derisively tagged as "wampum."
Beyond bonuses, many of the survivors on Wall Street have a deeper concern: Will their firm stay in business? Executives know that the industry suffers from overcapacity -- meaning there are far too many firms for the business there is to do.
 
Threatening to Close
 Late last month, the chairman of the Britain's NatWest Group, Lord Alexander, said that the investment banking subsidiary, County NatWest, "must become profitable in a year or two if we're to remain in that business."
That pronouncement hit especially hard at the firm's American division, where more than 60 employees had been hired as a group after their jobs at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ended with that firm's collapse last year.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: KUWAIT;
Shooting of Kuwaiti Lawyer Has the Opposition Afraid

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KUWAIT CITY, March 6

 BODY:
An assassination attempt last week against a prominent critic of the Kuwaiti Government has created a climate of fear among other dissidents, who asserted today that Government loyalists were using violence and intimidation to smother a postwar movement toward democracy.
The Government critic, Hamid al-Jouan, a 43-year-old lawyer and former member of the Kuwaiti Parliament, was left paralyzed below the waist after a bullet shattered part of his spine in an attack at his Kuwait City home on Thursday. 
 Even as their euphoric countrymen celebrated freedom after a harsh seven-month occupation by Iraq, several Kuwaitis associated with the pro-democracy movement said they now feared for their safety and believed that attacks on other opponents of the Government were likely.
 
Assertions of Intimidation
 The timing of the attack, which came less than than two days after Kuwait was captured by American and allied soldiers, was not accidental, they said.
Associates of Mr. Jouan, including the chairman of one of the nation's largest banks, have made the assertion that members of Kuwait's ruling Sabah family, a very large extended family or clan, might have ordered the attack in an effort to intimidate political opponents in the first days after the allies swept into Kuwait.
The Sabah family, which has controlled Kuwait since th middle of the 18th century and until recently has resisted calls to share Government authority with a freely elected legislature, denied any involvement in the shooting.
The banker, Abdul Aziz al-Sultan, chairman of the Gulf Bank of Kuwait, said in an interview today that he did not believe the Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, had anything to do with the attack on Mr. Jouan.
But he said that a group of "hawks" within the Emir's extended family had been involved in the shooting and in threats that had been made against other pro-democacy advocates in Kuwait.
 
Warnings to Critics
 He said he knew of at least two Kuwaiti men who had been visited at their homes or offices during the Iraqi occupation and warned that they faced an unspecified threat if they "attacked the Sabahs or were critical of the Sabahs" once the Iraqis had been ousted.
"I do believe that some factions of the Sabah family are involved" in the shooting and the threats, he said. "It's got to be related to people who are after the pro-democracy movement," he continued. "The young Sabahs are very undemocratic."
Mr. Sultan offered no evidence to support his allegation about a tie between the ruling family and the attack on Mr. Jouan. Other dissidents have said there is evidence implicating members of the Sabah family in the shooting, although they have not produced the information publicly.
Kuwait's Ambassador to the United States and a member of the Sabah family, Saud Nasir al-Sabah, said in an interview on the ABC News program "Nightline" that his family had been disturbed by the shooting and had nothing to do with it.
 
Oppostion Members Hide
 He said he was "extremely disappointed" in the statements made by Mr. Sultan, referring to the banker as a good friend and "a very responsible person."
He continued, "I would caution Mr. Sultan and others not to fall into the trap of people trying to drive a wedge between the Kuwaiti people."
As a result of the shooting of Mr. Jouan, some pro-democracy advocates in Kuwait and overseas have gone into hiding.
An economist and a former member of the Kuwaiti Parliament, Abdullah al-Nibadri, said he had begun sleeping in a different house each night in the last week, to foil any attempt by assassins to track him down.
 
Shot in the Chest
 "We are worried," he said in an interview. "I think somebody is hatching plans."
He said he first heard rumors in November that assassination squads might be formed by Government loyalists to kill Kuwaiti dissidents.
"We heard rumors of schemes of eliminating opposition members," he said. "After Hamid's case, we think the threat is becoming serious."
In an interview today in a hospital intensive-care unit, where he is being protected around the clock by armed guards, Mr. Jouan said he did not know the identity of his assailant or another man who drove the getaway car.
"He was a Kuwaiti, in his early 20's," said Mr. Jouan, who lay in bed in obvious pain as his wife, Khawla, looked on somberly. "He knocked on the door -- the garden door, the back door, and he called me by my nickname."
"I thought he was a very dear friend who had come to celebrate the liberation," he said. "I opened the door and he shot me at very near range, less than two yards."
He said he did not believe the Sabahs were involved in the shooting. The assailant, he said, was probably "from a group against democracy" who were trying to send a threatening message to others who have called for greater political freedom in Kuwait.

Inquiry on Occupation of Kuwait
 UNITED NATIONS, March 6 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United Nations announced today that it was sending a high-level mission to Kuwait to investigate reports of killings and other atrocities committed by Iraqi forces during the occupation, and to assess damage caused to property.
The mission is to collect information from the Kuwaiti Government as well as from humanitarian and other organizations.

HEADLINE: After 20 Lost Years, Arverne Skeptically Awaits Renewal

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
From the elevated A train rattling through Arverne, Queens, one sees a vast new town stretching along the oceanfront below -- shopping malls bustling with people, thousands of town houses, ribbons of newly carved roads, parks and playgrounds.
One sees this only with the imagination working hard. Otherwise all that is there is a huge, bleak reality -- block after block of barren, littered, weed-filled lots sprawling over two miles, the legacy of two decades of doomed plans. 
 Now this 300-acre wasteland in the Rockaway section, one of America's most notorious examples of redevelopment gone nowhere, is the subject of crucial negotiations to determine its fate: will it become a new seaside settlement, or will its heritage of failure carry into the future?
 
Series of Hurdles
 New York City officials and a group of developers are struggling to hammer out an agreement intended to lead to a 10-year, $1.5 billion program to build a new community for nearly 20,000 people on the site, the largest vacant piece of land available for development in New York City.
The 7,500 apartments would mostly be in three- and four-story town houses and would be priced to sell or rent to families with annual incomes of $45,000 to $80,000. Stores, movie theaters and a refurbished boardwalk and beach are also part of the package.
But to reach an agreement, Mayor David N. Dinkins's administration and the developers, Oceanview Associates of Manhattan, must overcome a series of major hurdles: a recession-ridden economy, the city's dire fiscal problems and a reduction in the project's scale forced by a politically savvy community determined to have a say.
Administration officials acknowledge the difficulties but are confident that an accord will be reached. Many residents and civic leaders on the Rockaway peninsula share the optimism.
But many others remain skeptical, and their reasons go beyond the real estate slump that has caused a number of other development plans in the city to falter.
 
'We're Still Waiting'
 In Arverne, limbo has been the rule for 20 years, in good times as well as bad. Proposals for the site have come and gone like sand castles built on the beach nearby.
"Hotels, casinos, this and that, and we're still waiting," Zetta Gibson, a 33-year-old postal worker who lives on Beach 56th Street, near the renewal site, said on a recent afternoon. She was referring to one of the past visions, for an Atlantic City-like complex, championed in the late 1970's by Donald R. Manes, then the Queens Borough President. It never got the backing it needed from the State Legislature.
But Cornell Byrd, 36, a security guard who lives on Shore Front Parkway, near the site, said he thought the present efforts would lead to something. "There's a lot of money to be made on this," he said.
Glancing toward the renewal tract, where discarded tires, mattresses and other trash were abundantly strewn, he said: "They have a lot of property here and nothing's been done with it. They have to do something with it."
 
Holtzman Raises Questions
 Top city officials also have varying outlooks. "We had 20 years of the old Madison Square Garden site before something came of it," said one optimist, Barbara J. Fife, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development, referring to the block between at Eighth and Ninth Avenues at 50th Street that is now home to the Worldwide Plaza complex.
But Ms. Fife acknowledged in an interview that the Arverne project "may not happen in the next couple of years, until market conditions change" and chances of financing improve.
Even less sanguine is City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman. Through a spokeswoman, she said she had "not received any information that would change" her opinion of last summer, when she was the only member of the Board of Estimate to vote against the Rockaways proposal.
Ms. Holtzman said at the time that the Dinkins administration and the developers had not presented the kind of detailed financial plan that "gives us some confidence in the structure and strength of the proposal."
In fact, among the knotty issues still unsettled in the current negotiations on the deal's final terms, those involved say, is one raised by Ms. Holtzman last summer: How a fiscally stricken city can come up with more than $100 million to finance its share of the public works costs in the project, including two new schools and a portion of the new roads and sewers.
Another issue is whether the city can keep its commitment to use Oceanview's payment for the city-owned land to finance more than 1,000 homes for lower-income families elsewhere, including 800 in adjoining Edgemere. When the Koch administration announced the project two years ago, it said Oceanview would pay $90 million for the site, but this has since been reduced to under $70 million, Ms. Fife said.
The price reduction -- and a sharp increase in the city's share of the public-works costs -- stems from scaling down the project to 7,500 apartments from the 10,000 originally planned. The cut followed vehement opposition to the larger proposal by many in the Rockaways, who argued that local public services like transportation, health care and firefighting could not handle an influx of 10,000 families.
A spokeswoman for Oceanview, Michele de Milly, also acknowledged that "the financing is not in place" for the apartments and other aspects of the plan that Oceanview would be responsible for. But she predicted that loans would be forthcoming once an agreement was reached with the city, given the developer's track record.
Oceanview is a joint venture of Forest City Development, which has built more than 60,000 units of housing across the country, and the Ratner Group and Park Tower Estates, which have carried out large-scale commercial developments.
Ms. de Milly declined to give the latest projections for the apartment prices, either if sold as condominiums -- as originally planned -- or leased as rentals, as she said some might now be. But Felice Michetti, the Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development, has previously said that the condos, at least, would range from about $135,000 to $177,000.
 
Quick to Raze, Slow to Rise
 Once a thriving summer vacation area where working-class families rented bungalows, Arverne fell on hard times after World War II; the vacationers went elsewhere and the bungalows were converted to year-round housing for the poor. The area quickly decayed and in 1968 nearly 4,000 structures were rapidly razed.
But little of the envisioned new housing materialized. Obstacles included the city's fiscal crisis of the 1970's, sharp cutbacks in Federal housing subsidies, local resistance to more subsidized housing in the area -- several low-income public housing projects already had already been built nearby -- and developers' lack of interestin building unsubsidized housing there.
Nor did the administration of Mayor Abraham D. Beame get far when it proposed in 1975 that Arverne be developed as a recreational complex.
As a result, the only significant construction on the 300 acres has been an apartment complex occupying about 20 acres, the 1,100-family Ocean Village, dating from the early 70's.
It stands like a settlement on the moon. "It's just dead around here," Lisa Anderson, 21, a nurse, said as she toted shopping bags back to her apartment.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE ARABS;
Arab Nations Propose Forming Peacekeeping Force for Gulf

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. SCHMIDT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 6

 BODY:
Foreign ministers from Arab nations that went to war with Iraq proposed today that additional Egyptian and Syrian troops be sent to the Persian Gulf, as the nucleus of an Arab peacekeeping force that would replace United States and Western forces.
The proposal came at the end a two-day meeting in Damascus, at which officials of Egypt, Syria and six Arab gulf nations, including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, outlined a broad series of measures for improving regional security and economic cooperation now that the war with Iraq is over. 
 Among other things, the eight Arab nations declared that now is the time to convene an international peace conference to address "the Israeli occupation of Arab land and insure the rights of the Palestinian people." They said the confrerence should meet under the auspices of the United Nations.
Last weekend in Cairo, a high-level official of the Egyptian Government suggested that an international conference on the Middle East ought to begin before the end of the year.
 
Praise From France
 In outlining its plan for an Arab peacekeeping force, the published text of the draft declaration that concluded the meeting revealed few details, and did not indicate when additional Arab troops might replace Western soldiers now in the region. But it said that the new Arab force would be purely defensive in nature.
In discussing the proposal, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria said Arab nations "will not permit a repetition of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, with all the destruction and divisions it left among the Arabs."
While Arab countries are not keen to have Western soldiers remain too long on the ground in the gulf, Western diplomats here said Arab governments had privately urged the United States to maintain a military presence in the region by leaving some military supplies behind and even increasing the number of United States Navy ships patrolling inside the gulf.
The plan for an all-Arab peacekeeping force drew quick praise from France, which has troops in the region. French officials said today that Foreign Minister Roland Dumas told a Cabinet meeting that France "supported the principle of an Arab buffer force," along the lines proposed in Damascus.
 
Iran Criticizes Security Plan
 But Iran, which was not part of the allied coalition, and now stands as the gulf's major military power after the defeat of Iraq, was critical of the proposal.
In a commentary on the Teheran radio, Iran argued that security measures for the Persian Gulf should involve exclusively those states that border on the gulf.
But in public and private discussions, officials in Cairo have said they intend to be sensitive to the concerns of neighbors like Iran and Turkey, which are large, non-Arab countries with whom they share a common culture and religion.
While the Arab countries of the gulf have vast oil wealth, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 showed they have virtually no ability to defend themselves against aggressors.
Egypt, which maintains a standing army of about 320,000 soliders, sent 35,000 troops and 400 tanks to join the allied coalition. Syria, which has an army of about 300,000, sent 20,000 troops and 300 tanks to the gulf.
Diplomats here say that in return for supplying the troops to guarantee security to oil-producing Arab nations in the gulf, Egypt and Syria are hoping to reap a windfall in new investment to help their sagging economys.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcies Rise by 16%

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Personal bankruptcies rose for the sixth straight year in 1990 to a record level, with the depressed Northeast showing the biggest increase in filings, a trade group said today.
A record 718,107 Americans filed for personal bankruptcy last year, up 16 percent from 1989, the group, the American Financial Services Association, said. 
 Economists said the record number of bankruptcies underscored the weak state of the economy. But they also said the distress stemmed from legal and social change. "It's more acceptable and easier to file for bankruptcy than it used to be," said David Wyss, research director at DRI/McGraw-Hill.
The 1990 figures, compiled by the Administrative Office of United States Courts, show the steepest overall increase since 1986.

HEADLINE: Treasury Acts to Curb Tax Benefits in Bailouts

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
The Treasury Department said today that it would seek to eliminate certain tax benefits that have been claimed by the owners of 199 savings associations sold in 1988 by the Government.
One Treasury official estimated that the decision, which officials in the department concede will almost surely be contested in the courts, would give the Government an additional $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion from the 1988 deals. These sales of savings and loans seized by the Government to private entrepreneurs have been strongly attacked in Congress as giveaways. Regulators have predicted that the cost to taxpayers of the bailout of these institutions would ultimately exceed $69 billion. 
 Executives at the savings associations involved said today that they would not comment until they had a chance to analyze the ruling.
 
Letter From Brady
 The Treasury's position was outlined in a letter sent this week to some members of Congress by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. Mr. Brady said that in the absence of Congressional action, the Treasury would seek to end deductions of losses and expenses by the owners of the 199 associations when those losses and expenses are reimbursed by regulators.
If, for example, an institution has an asset with a $100 book value that is sold at $40, the Government has agreed to make up the difference. Until now, the Internal Revenue Service has not objected when the institution still took the $60 as a loss for tax purposes. The Treasury said today that it would no longer permit such deductions and that the I.R.S. was prepared to bring the matter to court if savings associations failed to abide by it.
A Treasury official who insisted on not being identified said that permitting the deductibility of such assets "creates a perverse incentive" of encouraging associations to sell assets covered by the guarantees at the lowest possible price.
Administration officials conceded that the tax code was ambiguous in the area, leaving their position in the hands of the Federal courts.
"From the point of view of sound tax and financial policy, taking into account both the costs to the Government and the appropriate economic incentives for assisted institutions, it is clear that assisted institutions should not be allowed a tax deduction for losses or expenses that are reimbursed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation," Mr. Brady said in his letter. "Unfortunately, as a legal matter, the deductibility of covered losses and expenses under existing law is less clear."
 
Congressional Action Sought
 The letter added that without "a clear Congressional directive to the country," the Government would take the position that such assistance is taxable. "Congressional clarification of this issue seems not only desirable but essential," Mr. Brady said.
A "technical advice memorandum" issued in 1986 by the I.R.S. said such deductions were permissible.
The Treasury official who asked not to be identified said the memorandum was not legally binding on the Government and served mainly as guidance that need not always be followed by the I.R.S. The official said the memorandum would prevent the I.R.S. from seeking penalties and fines for the failure of associations to pay sufficient taxes.

HEADLINE: Ban on Replacing Strikers Faces Veto Threat

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Labor Secretary Lynn Martin said today that the Administration opposed union-supported legislation prohibiting companies from hiring permanent replacements for strikers, as a score of major companies have done in recent years.
Organized labor, which for years has seen its membership steadily erode, regards the use of replacement workers as a lethal threat to its power and has made banning the practice its highest priority in Congress this year. A bill to do that has 202 sponsors, nearly all of them Democrats, and could come to the full House for a vote before this summer. 
 "If the bill were presented to the President," Mrs. Martin told a hearing on the bill by a subcommittee of the House Education and Labor Committee, "his senior advisers would recommend a veto." Current labor laws, she said, have established a healthy balance in employer-worker relations that suits the public interest. She said the legislation would leave "little incentive for unions to moderate the use of the strike weapon."
Mrs. Martin's comments, the first from the Administration on the legislation, were no surprise to Democrats in the House or to labor unions. But in threatening a veto so early in the legislative process and in leaving little apparent room for compromise, Mrs. Martin surprised some labor leaders.
"It's astounding that so early in the process they would recommend a veto," said John J. Sheehan, chief lobbyist for the United Steelworkers of America. In a statement to the committee, Lane Kirkland, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said current law gave management incentives to provoke strikes and get rid of unions and blunted the strike as labor's ultimate weapon in negotiating disputes.
"If an employer can replace strikers permanently, that negates the right to strike," said Representative Major R. Owens, Democrat of Brooklyn.
Representative William L. Clay, a Missouri Democrat who wrote the House bill, said: "She made it crystal clear. There is no room to negotiate."
 
Reagan Brought Practice Back
 Mr. Clay said there was little doubt the House would enact the bill. Prospects are less certain in the Senate, where Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, has introduced a similar measure.
Under current law, employers have been free to put strikers out of their jobs permanently by hiring substitutes, but the practice was rare until 1981 when President Ronald Reagan used it to end a strike by Federal air traffic controllers. In the ensuing years, companies like the International Paper Company, Colt Industries, Eastern Airlines, Greyhound, Continental Airlines, the Chicago Tribune Company, and most recently its New York subsidiary, The Daily News, took on permanent replacements.
In most cases, the companies, with histories of sour labor relations, had fallen into difficult financial circumstances and were looking for help from wage cuts and staff reductions. Most companies avoid using permanent replacements, partly because of the difficulty they face in training a new work force and partly to preserve cooperative relationships with workers.
Representatives of organized labor and Mrs. Martin noted that there was a sharp decline in strikes in the 1980's. Last year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports, there were 45 strikes at companies with 1,000 or more workers. The annual average of strikes at companies of the same size since 1980 is 80. In the three decades before the 1980's the Bureau recorded a low of 181 strikes at such companies in 1963, and a record of 437 in 1953.
But the two viewed the decline entirely differently. Mrs. Martin sees a calm born of harmony from labor and management working together. Labor sees a calm born of fear, of workers who refuse to strike because they can be punished with the permanent loss of their jobs. Without the threat of a strike, unions see themselves as powerless in collective bargaining.
"The 80's saw many employers who were willing to sacrifice long-term labor stability for the immediate gratification of busting a union," said Representative Pat Williams, the Montana Democrat who is the chairman of the Labor-Management Subcommittee to which Mrs. Martin spoke.
But Mrs. Martin said that if the right to permanently replace economic strikers was prohibited, "there would be little incentive for unions to moderate the use of the strike weapon."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE PRESIDENT;
Transcript of President Bush's Address on End of the Gulf War

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's address last night to a joint session of Congress, and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley's introduction, as recorded by The New York Times:
FOLEY. Mr. President, it is customary at joint sessions for the chair to present the President to the members of Congress directly and without further comment. But I wish to depart from tradition tonight and express to you on behalf of the Congress and the country and through you to the members of our armed forces our warmest congratulations on the brilliant victory of the Desert Storm operation.
Members of the Congress, I now have the high privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the President of the United States.
 BUSH. Mr. President and Mr. Speaker, thank you, sir, for those very generous words spoken from the heart about the wonderful performance of our military. Members of Congress: Five short weeks ago, I came to this House to speak to you about the State of the Union. And we met then in time of war. Tonight, we meet in a world blessed by the promise of peace.
From the moment Operation Desert Storm commenced on Jan. 16 until the time the guns fell silent at midnight one week ago, this nation has watched its sons and daughters with pride -- watched over them with prayer. As Commander in Chief, I can report to you: Our armed forces fought with honor and valor. And as President, I can report to the nation aggression is defeated. The war is over.
This is a victory for every country in the coalition, for the United Nations. A victory for unprecedented international cooperation and diplomacy, so well led by our Secretary of State James Baker. It is a victory for the rule of law and for what is right.
Desert Storm's success belongs to the team that so ably leads our armed forces, our Secretary of Defense and our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs: Dick Cheney and Colin Powell.
And while you're standing, this military victory also belongs to the one the British call the "Man of the Match," the tower of calm at the eye of Desert Storm, Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf.
And let us, recognizing this was a coalition effort, let us not forget Saudi General Khalid, Britain's General de la Billiere, or General Roquejoffra of France, and all the others whose leadership played such a vital role. And most importantly, most importantly of all, all those who served in the field.
I thank the members of this Congress. Support here for our troops in battle was overwhelming. And above all, I thank those whose unfailing love and support sustained our courageous men and women: I thank the American people.
 
World After War
 Tonight -- tonight, I come to this House to speak about the world, the world after war.
The recent challenge could not have been clearer. Saddam Hussein was the villain, Kuwait the victim. To the aid of this small country came nations from North America and Europe, from Asia and South America, from Africa and the Arab world, all united against aggression.
Our uncommon coalition must now work in common purpose to forge a future that should never again be held hostage to the darker side of human nature.
Tonight in Iraq, Saddam walks amidst ruin. His war machine is crushed. His ability to threaten mass destruction is itself destroyed. His people have been lied to, denied the truth. And when his defeated legions come home, all Iraqis will see and feel the havoc he has wrought. And this I promise you: For all that Saddam has done to his own people, to the Kuwaitis, and to the entire world, Saddam and those around him are accountable.
All of us grieve for the victims of war, for the people of Kuwait and the suffering that scars the soul of that proud nation. We grieve for all our fallen soldiers and their families, for all the innocents caught up in this conflict. And yes, we grieve for the people of Iraq, a people who have never been our enemy. My hope is that one day we will once again welcome them as friends into the community of nations.
 
Four Key Challenges
 Our commitment to peace in the Middle East does not end with the liberation of Kuwait. So tonight, let me outline four key challenges to be met.
First, we must work together to create shared security arrangements in the region. Our friends and allies in the Middle East recognize that they will bear the bulk of the responsibility for regional security. But we want them to know that just as we stood with them to repel aggression, so now America stands ready to work with them to secure the peace.
This does not mean stationing U.S. ground forces in the Arabian Peninsula, but it does mean American participation in joint exercises involving both air and ground forces. It means maintaining a capable U.S. naval presence in the region, just as we have for over 40 years. And let it be clear: Our vital national interests depend on a stable and secure gulf.
Second, we must act to control the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles used to deliver them. It would be tragic if the nations of the Middle East and Persian Gulf were now, in the wake of war, to embark on a new arms race. Iraq requires special vigilance. Until Iraq convinces the world of its peaceful intentions -- that its leaders will not use new revenues to rearm and rebuild its menacing war machine -- Iraq must not have access to the instruments of war.
And third, we must work to create new opportunities for peace and stability in the Middle East. On the night I announced Operation Desert Storm, I expressed my hope that out of the horrors of war might come new momentum for peace. We've learned in the modern age, geography cannot guarantee security and security does not come from military power alone.
All of us know the depth of bitterness that has made the dispute between Israel and its neighbors so painful and intractable. Yet, in the conflict just concluded, Israel and many of the Arab states have for the first time found themselves confronting the same aggressor. By now, it should be plain to all parties that peacemaking in the Middle East requires compromise. At the same time, peace brings real benefits to everyone. We must do all that we can to close the gap between Israel and the Arab states and between Israelis and Palestinians. The tactics of terror lead absolutely nowhere; there can be no substitute for diplomacy.
A comprehensive peace must be grounded in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and the principle of territory for peace. This principle must be elaborated to provide for Israel's security and recognition, and at the same time for legitimate Palestinian political rights. Anything else would fail the twin tests of fairness and security. The time has come to put an end to Arab-Israeli conflict.
The war with Iraq is over. The quest for solutions to the problems in Lebanon, in the Arab-Israeli dispute, and in the gulf must go forward with new vigor and determination. And I guarantee you no one will work harder for a stable peace in the region than we will.
Fourth, we must foster economic development for the sake of peace and progress. The Persian Gulf and Middle East -- and Middle East -- form a region rich in natural resources with a wealth of untapped human potential. Resources once squandered on military might -- military might must be redirected to more peaceful ends. We are already addressing the immediate economic consequences of Iraq's aggression. Now, the challenge is to reach higher to foster economic freedom and prosperity for all the people of the region. By meeting these four challenges we can build a framework for peace. I've asked Secretary of State Baker to go to the Middle East to begin the process. He will go to listen, to probe, to offer suggestions, to advance the search for peace and stability.
I've also asked him to raise the plight of the hostages held in Lebanon. We have not forgotten them. And we will not forget them.
To all the challenges that confront this region of the world, there is no single solution, no solely American answer. But we can make a difference. America will work tirelessly as a catalyst for positive change.
But we cannot lead a new world abroad if, at home, it's politics as usual on American defense and diplomacy. It's time to turn away from the temptation to protect unneeded weapons systems and obsolete bases. It's time to put an end, it's time to put an end to micro-management of foreign and security assistance programs, micro-management that humiliates our friends and allies and hamstrings our diplomacy. It's time to rise above the parochial and the pork barrel, to do what is necessary, what's right and what will enable this nation to play the leadership role required of us.
The consequences of the conflict in the gulf reach far beyond the confines of the Middle East. Twice before in this century, an entire world was convulsed by war. Twice this century, out of the horrors of war hope emerged for enduring peace. Twice before, those hopes proved to be a distant dream, beyond the grasp of man.
Until now, the world we've known has been a world divided, a world of barbed wire and concrete block, conflict and cold war.
And now, we can see a new world coming into view. A world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order. In the words of Winston Churchill, a "world order" in which "the principles of justice and fair play . . . protect the weak against the strong." A world where the United Nations, freed from cold war stalemate, is poised to fulfill the historic vision of its founders. A world in which freedom and respect for human rights find a home among all nations.
The gulf war put this new world to its, its first test. And my fellow Americans, we passed that test.
For the sake of our principles, for the sake of the Kuwaiti people, we stood our ground. Because the world would not look the other way, Ambassador Al-Sabah, tonight Kuwait is free. Where is he? And we're very happy about that.
 
Lessons of History
 Tonight, as our troops begin to come home, let us recognize that the hard work of freedom still calls us forward. We've learned the hard lessons of history. The victory over Iraq was not waged as "a war to end all wars." Even the new world order cannot guarantee an era of perpetual peace. But enduring peace must be our mission.
Our success in the gulf will shape not only the new world order we seek but our mission here at home.
In the war just ended, there were clear-cut objectives, timetables and, above all, an overriding imperative to achieve results. We must bring that same sense of self-discipline, that same sense of urgency, to the way we meet challenges here at home.
In my State of the Union Address and in my budget, I defined a comprehensive agenda to prepare for the next American century.
Our first priority is to get this economy rolling again. The fear and uncertainty caused by the gulf crisis were understandable. But now that the war is over, oil prices are down, interest rates are down and confidence is rightly coming back. Americans can move forward to lend, spend and invest in this, the strongest economy on earth.
We must also enact the legislation that is key to building a better America, For example, in 1990, we enacted an historic Clean Air Act. And now we've proposed a national energy strategy. We passed a child care bill that put power in the hands of parents. And today, we're ready to do the same thing with our schools, and expand, expand choice in education. We passed a crime bill that made a useful start in fighting crime and drugs. This year we're sending to Congress our comprehensive crime package to finish the job. We passed the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act. And now we've sent forward our civil rights bill. We also passed the aviation bill. This year we've sent up our new highway bill.
And these are just a few of our pending proposals for reform and renewal.
 
Call for Domestic Action
 So tonight, I call on the Congress to move forward aggressively on our domestic front. Let's begin with two initiatives we should be able to agree on quickly. transportation and crime. And then, let's build on success with those and enact the rest of our agenda. If our forces could win the ground war in 100 hours, then surely the Congress can pass this legislation in 100 days. Let, let that be a promise we make tonight to the American people.
When I spoke in this House about the state of our union, I asked all of you: If we can selflessly confront evil for the sake of good in a land so far away, then surely we can make this land all that it should be. In the time since then, the brave men and women of Desert Storm accomplished more than even they may realize. They set out to confront an enemy abroad, and in the process, they transformed a nation at home.
Think, think of the way they went about their mission -- with confidence and quiet pride. Think about their sense of duty, about all they taught us, about our values, about ourselves.
We hear so often about our young people in turmoil, how our children fall short, how our schools fail us, how American products and American workers are second class. Well, don't you believe it. The America we saw in Desert Storm was first-class talent.
And they -- and they did it -- they did it using America's state-of-the-art technology. We saw the excellence embodied in the Patriot missile and the patriots who made it work.
And we saw soldiers who know about honor and bravery and duty and country and the world-shaking power of these simple words.
There is something noble and majestic about the pride, about the patriotism, that we feel tonight.
So, to everyone here, and everyone watching at home, think about the men and women of Desert Storm. Let us honor them with our gratitude. Let us comfort the families of the fallen and remember each precious life lost.
Let us learn from them as well. Let us honor those who have served us by serving others.
Let us honor them as individuals, men and women of every race, all creeds and colors, by setting the face of this nation against discrimination, bigotry and hate. Eliminate that.
I'm sure that many of you saw on -- on the television -- the unforgettable scene of four terrified Iraqi soldiers surrendering. They emerged from their bunker broken, tears streaming from their eyes, fearing the worst. And then there was an American soldier. Remember what he said? He said: "It's O.K. You're all right now. You're all right now."
That scene says a lot about America, a lot about who we are. Americans are a caring people. We are a good people, a generous people. Let us always be caring and good and generous in all we do.
 
March Home From Gulf
 Soon, very soon, our troops will begin the march we've all been waiting for, their march home. And I have directed Secretary Cheney to begin the immediate return of American combat units from the gulf.
Less than two hours from now, the first planeload of American soldiers will lift off from Saudi Arabia headed for the U.S.A. That plane will carry the men and women of the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division bound for Fort Stewart, Ga. This is just -- this is just the beginning of a steady flow of American troops coming home.
Let their return remind us that all those who have gone before are linked with us in the long line of freedom's march. Americans have always tried to serve, to sacrifice nobly for what we believe to be right.
Tonight, I ask every community in this country to make this coming Fourth of July a day of special celebration for our returning troops. They may have missed Thanksgiving and Christmas, but I can tell you this: For them and for their families, we can make this a holiday they'll never forget.
In a very real sense, this victory belongs to them, to the privates and the pilots, to the sergeants and the supply officers, to the men and women in the machines, and the men and women who made them work. It belongs to the regulars, to the Reserves, to the National Guard. This victory belongs to the finest fighting force this nation has ever known in its history.
We went halfway around the world to do what is moral and just and right. And we fought hard, and -- with others -- we won the war. And we lifted the yoke of aggression and tyranny from a small country that many Americans had never even heard of, and we ask nothing in return.
We're coming home now proud, confident, heads high. There is much that we must do at home and abroad. And we will do it. We are Americans.
May God bless this great nation, the United States of America. Thank you all very much.
Thank you guys. Thank you very, very much.

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: POLITICS;
Cease-Fire in the Capital Comes to a Bitter Close

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Hours before Congressional leaders gave a warm welcome to President Bush at a joint session tonight, the political cease-fire imposed by the Persian Gulf war came to a snarling end.
Congressional Democrats displayed growing dismay today over Republican efforts to paint them as weak and unpatriotic for opposing war against Iraq, and Senator Al Gore of Tennessee took the Senate floor to accuse the Republicans of "poisoning our national politics." 
 At virtually the same moment two Republican Senators, Phil Gramm of Texas and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, attacked the Democrats for contending that Republican economic policies had hurt the poor, saying Congressional Budget Office statistics showed that the poor had thrived under President Ronald Reagan's policies.
Each side was working hard to deflate the other party's most potent political issue.
 
A Haunting Vote
 To Democrats, the dazzlingly quick success of the war not only dimmed already distant hopes for the White House but also has appeared to shake the earlier confidence many expressed that their votes in Congress against the use of force in the gulf would not prove politically life threatening as long as they had been thoughtfully explained.
To Republicans, the Democratic votes against using force have presented sudden new opportunities, but decades of Democratic success in labeling them as the party of the rich serve as a sleepless reminder of a fundamental problem that the Democrats can resurrect in a hurry, as they did in the last days of the 1990 campaign.
Senator Gore, who is the only prominent Democratic Presidential hopeful to vote in favor of war against Iraq and thus is politically well positioned on the issue, was responding to a growing Republican message. It was epitomized last week when Mr. Gramm said the opposition of Democratic leaders to going to war showed that "Democrats cannot be trusted to define the destiny of America, that Democrats cannot be trusted to make America a world leader."
House Speaker Thomas S. Foley assailed Republicans on Tuesday for this theme, saying that despite the unity of the war effort, some Republicans "want to disunite the country again for political purposes."
 
G.O.P. Tactic: Ridicule
 Republicans have largely avoided direct attacks on the Democrats for their votes on Jan. 12 against authorizing the use of force, but their ranging fire comes close.
Representative Newt Gingrich, the House Republicann whip, has argued that it is best to attack the Democrats for votes against weapons systems that worked in the gulf and to recruit gulf veterans as Republican candidates.
He also urged ridiculing the Democrats as obstructionists, with a gulf war theme. On Tuesday the Georgia Republican, on the Fox Morning News television program, said, "If Norm Schwarzkopf had had to report to the Democratic Congress, we'd still be unloading the first five tanks and debating which way they should point."
Mr. Gore today condemned the Republicans for trying to "manipulate votes of conscience into political tools." He called on Mr. Bush to "impose the political discipline some Republicans appear to need to put the national good before their poilitical maneuvering."
In an interview later, Mr. Gore said his concern in making the speech was not the possible political threat to Democrats. His own vote in favor of force was cast without political reckoning, he said, and added he is still not looking at the issue in those terms.
 
Reagan and the Poor, Revisited
 Mr. Gore said that instead, his concern was over the risk of losing an opportunity when "victory ought to be seen as an opportunity for our nation to seek a transformation of our national politics," away from its triviality.
At a news conference held while Mr. Gore was making his floor speech, Senators Gramm and Domenici said they were trying to dispel the impression circulated by Democrats that recent tax law changes favored the rich and that the Republican policies of the 1980's had generally enabled the rich to get richer while the poor got poorer.
Mr. Domenici, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, said Congressional Budget Office figures proved that "during the 80's, the rich got richer and the poor got richer."
He offered a chart showing that the income of the poorest fifth of the nation's families had grown 11.8 percent from 1983 to 1989, while that of the richest fifth had increased by 12.2 percent.
 
Statistics Skirmish
 The Senator said this was in stark contrast to what happened from 1979 to 1983, a period that he termed recession years attributable to the policies of the Carter Administration, even though President Jimmy Carter left office on Jan. 20, 1981. In those years, Mr. Domenici said, the income of the poorest fifth of the nation's families declined by 17.4 percent, while that of the richest fifth increased by 4.8 percent.
George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate Democratic leader, scorned the Republicans' selection of comparative years as "an obvious statistician's trick" intended to avoid any blame for the current recession. He also said that Mr. Domenici's figures showing greater gains for poor families from 1983 to 1989, under Mr. Reagan, than from 1975 to 1979, under Mr. Carter, overlooked the fact that gains in six years of expansion ought to be greater than those in four years.
Reflecting the central importance of the "fairness" issue to Democratic campaigns, Mr. Mitchell made it clear that the Republican arguments would be met full force. He said Democrats were going over all the Gramm-Domenici numbers and would offer a thorough rebuttal on Thursday.
Mr. Gramm, chairman of the Republican Senate campaign committee, said the statistics showed that under Mr. Carter's policies, whose effect he dated from 1978 to 1982, "every income group in the country got poorer."
 
'Very Good Jobs'
 He also contended that the numbers demonstrated that the jobs created in the 1980's were not, as Democrats argue, low-paying jobs. "The number of poor-paying jobs actually declined," he said, citing an 8.9 percent decrease in the number of farm workers from 1982 to 1989 and a 31.3 percent increase in managerial and professional jobs in that period.
Mr. Domenici said this showed the jobs were "very, very good jobs, not hamburger flipper jobs."
Mr. Gramm said the Congressional Budget Office data also showed that Democrats were wrong when, arguing that Social Security tax increases had outweighed the effect of income tax cuts, they said the Federal tax structure had become more regressive.
He said the data showed that the share of Federal taxes paid by the bottom 40 percent of all families had gone from 8.6 percent of the total in 1980 to 8.9 percent in 1985 and fallen to 8.2 percent in 1990. And the share paid by the top 1 percent, the top 5 percent, the top 10 percent and the top 20 percent, he said, increased in each of those periods.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Tokyo's Prospects Depend on Rates

BYLINE: By James Sterngold

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
THE swift conclusion of the Persian Gulf war has cleared up a big uncertainty hanging over the world economy. But in Japan, the removal of that question mark has merely permitted investors to focus on a host of other knotty uncertainties that are leaving the outlook here uncharacteristically muddy.
Suddenly, investors in the United States, who had been fretting over an ailing economy and the prospects of a prolonged war, seem much more certain about the future than do the Japanese, who import 70 percent of their oil from the Middle East and seemed to have the most to gain from war's end. 
 What makes the situation particularly vexing for the Japanese is that the issue turns not on a host of unpredictable forces, but on one human decision: When will the Bank of Japan cut interest rates?
Over the last few days, the Tokyo stock exchange has largely taken its cue from the bubbly New York market, bounding along behind Wall Street's victory strut.
The 225-stock Nikkei index gained 469.51 points yesterday and another 14.97 points today, to close at 26,397.96. Since the beginning of the year, the Nikkei has risen 10.6 percent. The rebound has been especially appreciated after the steep market slide last year, which wiped out nearly 40 percent of the value of shares here. The Nikkei is still 12,000 points below its high, while on Wall Street the Dow Jones industrial average is flirting with a record.
The Tokyo market's improvement has come just in time to help salvage the fiscal year most companies in Japan follow. That period ends March 31. At the least, the unrealized losses that many investors are sitting on will shrink.
But there is a surprising lack of consensus on where Japanese stocks are heading. "The market is a little pricey," said Lawrence S. Prager, a senior analyst for Nikko Securities. "This economy is still in the process of slowing down."
Liam Newberg, senior analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company, noted that the bond market was leading the way. With bond yields sliding, investors have been more willing to bet that the central bank might act. In fact, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Government bond closed at 6.6 percent yesterday, down from about 8.5 percent last fall.
"Bonds are headed in the right direction," he said, adding that he expected no substantial drop from here.
Kermit Schoenholtz, an economist at Salomon Brothers, takes an opposite view. He agreed that the economy was stalling -- Salomon expects growth of about 2.2 percent in the fiscal year, compared with the Japanese Government's forecast of 3.8 percent -- but said the slowdown would force the central bank's hand. Interest rates will drop, big investors will not be forced to sell shares at distressed prices and corporate profits will rebound.
"It's a virtuous circle at play," Mr. Schoenholtz said.
Andrew Ballingal, the chief strategist here for Barclays de Zoete Wedd, counts himself among the bears. One reason he contends that the Tokyo market has been swept up too quickly behind Wall Street is because a good part of the buying has come from the United States, not Japan.
According to Tokyo stock exchange figures, foreigners have been net buyers of a little more than $10 billion worth of Japanese equities in 1991, and Mr. Ballingal said anecdotal evidence indicated that most of the money came from America. He added that the inflow could not be counted on to cover up for long what has been steady selling by most Japanese investors, who have been burdened by high interest rates.
The Bank of Japan raised interest rates sharply over the last two years to cool the overheated economy and reduce inflationary expectations. So, just about every week the papers have been filled with speculation on when the inevitable cut in rates will come. But Yasushi Mieno, the central bank's governor, repeated again this week that he felt the economy was still strong and that inflationary pressures remained substantial.
In the meantime, the central bank released a survey of business confidence on Tuesday that suggested corporations were hunkering down for even slower economic expansion. Capital spending, an engine of growth in recent years, is expected to expand just 1.1 percent this year, according to the survey, down from more than 15 percent growth in 1990. That has only deepened the guessing on when the central bank will act to stave off a recession.
"In my view, this is a bear market rally," said Mr. Ballingal, who added that any interest rate reductions would be slight. "If this does turn into a bull market, it will be anemic."
Mr. Schoenholtz countered, "There are conflicting forces, but we think there will be a psychological shift that will help the market." Salomon, he said, sees the Nikkei average testing the 30,000 level by midyear.

HEADLINE: Recession Steals Into a Stronghold of Wealth

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERNARDSVILLE, N.J.

 BODY:
The Rev. Fred Baldwin, the tweed-clad priest at St. Bernard's Episcopal Church, takes tea every day at 4 in the rectory, an Edwardian country house down the hill from the Somerset Hills Country Club.
Tea at century-old St. Bernard's is not the sort of setting where one would expect to find people talking about losing their jobs, declaring bankruptcy and how to find work. But those were the topics the other day when Mr. Baldwin was joined by three parishioners: a Wall Street broker, an investment banker and a salesman for a health-care company. 
 "Bernardsville is what you think the American Dream is -- the country club, successful careers, the dream house," Mr. Baldwin said. "All of the real problems are kept in secret. But now with the recession and unemployment, people can't keep up the facade anymore."
Recession has touched New Jersey, and wealthy Bernardsville, in the Somerset Hills horse country, has not escaped. These men were available for tea on a weekday afternoon because they had all lost their jobs in the last year. Mr. Baldwin said that out of 150 families in his parish, at least 15 have been hit by unemployment.
To the men, their sitting down together is a recognition of a big change in their lives, not only in financial circumstances but also in how much control they feel they have, and how they view work. To others, the fact that St. Bernard's has so many members like these men that it has been moved to form a support group for them is the ultimate sign that life is changing.
Mr. Baldwin commented critically about self-indulgent spending the other day as he drove through one of the new subdivisions of million-dollar "trophy" houses that have sprung up in the area. Some of them stood empty.
Bernardsville, a town of about 7,000 people 30 miles west of New York City, has always been a place where to move in is to have arrived. St. Bernard's, a stone Gothic church amid woods and gardens, was founded in the late 19th century by a group of tycoons. More recently, the younger parishioners have included executives who commute to the nearby A.T. & T. headquarters or, farther, to Wall Street.
 
Cucumbers and Stories
 At the rectory, over cucumber sandwiches and Earl Grey tea, the investment banker said: "This guy at my office called me in on Dec. 6. He said, 'Look, there's been a downturn in business, blah, blah, blah.'
"I sort of glazed over and -- blip! -- there it is. I was out. You can't work on Wall Street without knowing which way the wind is blowing, but it still hit me like a brick."
Mr. Baldwin, who moved here six years ago from St. James Episcopal Church on Madison Avenue, reminds his parishioners that he knows what it is to be downwardly mobile. He is in the process of getting a divorce from a highly paid options trader.
Not all the parishioners who are affected by the recession had high-paying jobs. One is a private-school language teacher who said she would be laid off next fall.
Some concede that when they were making money they were spending too much of it too quickly.
"It's kind of like the ant and grasshopper story," said Philip McCarthy, an unemployed construction manager. "The ant puts everything away. I've been the grasshopper for 20 years. Who knows where the money went? I used to like to work on cars. I owned three or four at one time -- sports cars, BMW's. Now all I have is the house."
Mr. McCarthy wasn't earning nearly six figures. But the investment banker, who is 29 years old, was -- easily.
"I knew I wasn't worth six figures," he said.
Like the other two men, the investment banker would speak only anonymously, saying he feared that being identified might hurt his chances of finding another job. He said he had liquified his IRA's and could hold out another six months without a job.
The salesman, who is 42, received a week's severance pay when his company lost a major contract and laid him off a month ago. He said he was not worried yet, but he did say he will cut off his car phone soon.
The Wall Street broker, who had been earning $400,000 a year at a securities firm, is in the worst shape. He had to sell his house -- for $400,000, the same price he paid -- and move in with his brother-in-law. His BMW and Jaguar were repossessed. He is about to declare bankruptcy. His wife has gone to work as a secretary.
"Back in the 80's, you really didn't save," said the broker, who has two small children. "You thought the next year was going to be good. I was on my way to becoming a millionaire. A lot of the money went into the house, cars, education for the kids, vacations. I would get my suits custom made, at $1,000 to $1,500 a suit. The suits are about all I have left."
Bernardsville looks just as prosperous and staid as it did five years ago, the boom years. The stately houses are still standing on their meticulously landscaped 5- and 10-acre wooded lots. One of the town's famous residents, Millicent Fenwick, the frugal Republican former Congresswoman, said that as she drives around in her Chevrolet she is still dismayed by all the BMW's and Mercedes-Benzes.
"I hate conspicuous waste," Mrs. Fenwick said the other day, noting further that in her 81 years she has been the holder of a single credit card -- American Express -- which she ripped up not long ago.
 
Town Changing 'Inwardly'
 There is no sign of a mass renunciation of credit cards among Mrs. Fenwick's fellow townspeople. But life is somehow different.
"Outwardly, everything is the same," said James Garrison, a longtime member of St. Bernard's and an executive in search of work. "But inwardly something has changed."
At the True Value Hardware Store on Route 202, the owner, James Clark, said his customers were no longer snatching up top-of-the-line items like gas grills and brass mailboxes. David Neill, whose family established the MJ Neill Fuel Company in 1917, said some of his most reliable customers had fallen behind.
 
Empty Million-Dollar Homes
 Dorothy Castro, a real-estate broker, says she knows of more than 30 houses in the area selling for $1 million and up. Some were built in the last three years and never occupied.
"Three or four years ago everybody wanted a huge house worth a million dollars," Mrs. Castro said. "A lot of people got in over their heads."
Last week, 10 men and 6 women gathered at St. Bernard's for the first meeting of the Career Support Group. The broker and the salesman from the tea were there. So was Janice Logg, who lost her job as a bank manager last August in a takeover. Ms. Logg has sent out 250 resumes. So far, no job.
Philip McCarthy, who tried to start his own business a year ago, was at the group session, too.
"I figured with my associations and acquaintances over the last 23 years I could draw up enough work to keep me busy," Mr. McCarthy said before the meeting. "By the middle of August I had called hundreds of people. They said, 'We don't have any work.' " Ten years ago, he said, "I would've been swamped" with job offers.
Mr. McCarthy has been rewriting "an old-fashioned boiler plate resume," reading books like "How to Get a Better Job in This Crazy World" and reconsidering his future.
"I'd like to go to work for a large corporation, put in my 20 years and collect my pension," he said.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees Improved Outlook for Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told Congress today that the end of the war with Iraq "removed a troublesome uncertainty" from the nation's economy and improved the chances that the recession would be relatively short and mild.
"The relief from lower energy prices along with a potential boost to confidence from the end of the gulf war should be laying the groundwork for some firming in consumer spending in coming months," Mr. Greenspan, the Government's most influential economic policy maker, said in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 Although he acknowledged that "the economy continues to edge down," Mr. Greenspan suggested that the Fed would not cut interest rates further to stimulate the economy without clearer signs that trends were unfavorable.
"Whether further adjustments to policy will be required to foster an upturn in output and employment is not yet clear. Any decision in that regard will depend on how trends in real activity, inflation and monetary aggregates unfold."
 
Some Rates Up a Bit
 Some mortgage and bond rates have risen slightly since the Federal Reserve last reduced the interest rates it controls five weeks ago. But "this should not materially interfere with an upturn in activity," Mr. Greenspan said.
The next gauge of the economy comes Friday, when the Labor Department releases data on employment and joblessness in February. Economists who are predicting an end to the recession by late spring or early summer expect the new figures to show that payroll employment fell by about 100,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate was lower than 6.5 percent. The unemployment rate was 6.2 percent in January.
The anticipated employment statistics would indicate that while the economy continued to slide, a recovery might be possible without further action by the Federal Reserve. But if the situation proves to be worse than expected, many economists believe, the Federal Reserve might be persuaded to step in with lower interest rates.
 
Negative Factors
 The chairman said that a number of negative factors persisted in the economy, including the continued scarcity of credit and weakness in the real estate market. But he said he expected "the turn to occur within a reasonably short period of time."
He added, "The scales appear to tip slightly in favor of suggesting that the current downturn might well prove milder than most of the recessions in the past 40 years."
Mr. Greenspan's forecast is not surprising, since he has been saying for weeks that the recession would probably not be severe if the war was short. But this was his first public appearance since the end of the war last week, so his appraisal was closely watched in political circles and financial markets.
"Anecdotal reports" in the days after hostilities ended are encouraging about the economy picking up, Mr. Greenspan said, but he cautioned that "hard economic data for the period will not be available for some weeks."
 
Stance on Banking Revisions
 On another matter, Mr. Greenspan said he supported most elements of the Bush Administration's proposal to change the nation's banking laws and thought it was especially important to remove restrictions against banks opening branches nationwide. He said he might quarrel with some aspects of the proposed legislation but did not identify them.
Federal Reserve officials said this week that Mr. Greenspan and the other Fed governors were strongly opposed to the part of the Administration proposal that would relieve the Fed of supervisory authority over many of the nation's largest banks.
Mr. Greenspan said he expected some large banks to merge in the next few years, but he said most small community banks would probably survive. "Local knowledge is a very important economic value," he said. "Community banks are going to be very difficult to competitively dislodge."

HEADLINE: AFTER THE WAR: THE WHITE HOUSE;
BUSH, URGING WIDER PEACE, HINTS AT PRESSURE ON ISRAEL TO YIELD LAND FOR SECURITY

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
President Bush said tonight that he would immediately begin bringing American troops home from the Persian Gulf. But he pledged to maintain a strong diplomatic presence in the Middle East and to redouble efforts to solve the stubborn Arab-Israeli conflict.
"Our commitment to peace in the Middle East does not end with the liberation of Kuwait," Mr. Bush told a joint session of Congress, adding to applause: "The time has come to put an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict." 
 In remarks almost certain to be perceived by Israel as a signal that he intends to seek important concessions from its Government, Mr. Bush re-emphasized longstanding American policy that Israel must trade territory that it seized during wars with its Arab neighbors in exchange for peace and secure borders.
 
3-Minute Ovation
 The President was welcomed by a three-minute ovation from lawmakers, who wore yellow ribbons in their lapels, waved small American flags and chanted his name. The Speaker of the House, Representative Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, introduced Mr. Bush by giving him "our warmest congratulations on the brilliant victory of the Desert Storm operation."
Mr. Bush, looking quietly pleased and at moments emotional, basked in the atmosphere of triumph, which produced cheers at his every mention of the military.. The enthusiastic response seemed more typical of a political convention than a joint session.
While the evening was not supposed to be a partisan occasion, many Republicans wore yellow buttons that said "I voted with the President," referring to the January vote in which Congress authorized the use of force in the Persian Gulf.
In his pledge to seek long-term solutions, the President said that efforts should be made "to close the gap between Israel and the Arab states -- and between Israel and Palestinians."
Mr. Bush said, "By now, it should be plain to all parties that peacemaking in the Middle East requires compromise," [Transcript, page A8.]
 
Baker Mission to Mideast
 Coming on the eve of the departure of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d for the Middle East, Mr. Bush's remarks seemed likely be viewed in Israel as an appeal to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to make territorial concessions to the Palestinians.
But the address also clearly signaled to Arab leaders that Washington will encourage them to deal directly with Israel, and to move toward formal recognition of Israel and its sovereignty. Mr. Bush did not mention any specific plans, and he left it unclear what solution he envisaged to the Palestinian problem.
Palestinians have generally sought an independent nation carved out of the occupied West Bank of the Jordan and the Gaza Strip, or at the minimum, an autonomous homeland somehow linked to Jordan.
In calling for bolder steps to end the enmity in the Middle East, Mr. Bush's comments seemed to mark a departure from the more incremental diplomacy the Administration has pursued in the region.
 
U.N. Resolutions Cited
 He cited United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 of November 1967, which called on Israel to give up unspecified amounts of territory it had captured during the June 1967 war in return for recognition by the Arab countries of its borders.
He also cited Security Council Resolution 338 of October 1973, which was approved after the war of that month and called for negotiations between Israel and the Arabs.
Israel did return Sinai, which it had captured from Egypt, as part of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty of 1979, but it has generally refused to give the Golan Heights back to Syria or the West Bank to Jordan. Arab nations have refused to sign peace treaties with Israel unless all the occupied land was returned. The situation has been complicated by the Palestinian campaign for a state or homeland.
In the nationally televised speech, Mr. Bush promised that he would not back away from America's difficult new responsibilities in a region left roiling and recast by the Persian Gulf war.
 
Savoring U.S. Victory
 The speech, capping a half-year of extraordinary diplomatic and military maneuvers that put the nation on an emotional roller-coaster, was a time for the President to savor the nearly unanimous accolades for his skill in cementing a disparate coalition and conducting a swift and victorious war.
After resisting the national ebullience that followed the cease-fire, saying he wanted to stay apart from the heady mood until he could tell the American people that the last "t" was crossed and "i" was dotted, Mr. Bush finally declared victory.
"As Commander in Chief, I can report to you: Our armed forces fought with honor and valor," he said. "As President, I can report to the nation: Aggression is defeated. The war is over."
The applause was also fervid as the President thanked his commanders, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the field commander of American forces. Mr. Cheney and General Powell attended the session.
Mr. Bush said he had directed Mr. Cheney to begin the immediate return of American combat units from the gulf.
 
'A Steady Flow' Homeward
 "Less than two hours from now, the first planeload of American soldiers will lift off from Saudi Arabia headed for the U.S.A.," he said. "It will carry men and women of the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division bound for Fort Stewart, Ga. This is just the beginning of a steady flow of American troops coming home."
Just after midnight Eastern time, the first troops boarded planes bound for the United States, military officials in Saudi Arabia said. The infantry division contains about 30,000 troops, about 700 of whom are scheduled to return this week, they said.
The Administration's inclination seems to be to speed up the withdrawal of American troops, because they could be a lightning rod for anti-American sentiment in the region and because the President had promised to bring the troops home as soon as he could.
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have indicated that they would prefer to see a large contingent of American ground forces remain in the region at least for the better part of the year, but Mr. Bush is eager to fulfill his pledge that the war was not an excuse to install a permanent, large American ground force in the area.
He outlined his plan for "the world after war" that he will refine in a series of meetings with allied leaders next week.
 
'Darker Side of Human Nature'
 "Our uncommon coalition must now work in common purpose to forge a future that should never again be held hostage to the darker side of human nature," he said.
Tonight, Mr. Bush allowed himself to gloat just a little, as he basked in the bipartisan applause and the national joy at the outcome of the war.
Once again underscoring that the country has "kicked the Vietnam syndrome," as he put it last week, the President even proposed a special holiday within a holiday to thank the troops.
"I ask every community in this country to make this coming Fourth of July a day of special celebration for our returning troops," he said. "They may have missed Thanksgiving and Christmas, but I can tell you this: For them and for their families, we can make this a holiday they'll never forget.
"In a very real sense, this victory belongs to them -- to the privates and the pilots, to the sergeants and the supply officers, to the men and women in the machines, and the men and women who made them work."
Mr. Bush had been invited to Capitol Hill tonight for a celebration; politicians here wanted to capture and promote the feeling that the nation had moved beyond the gloomy sense of America's decline as a world and economic power, as well as years stained by political scandal and marred Presidencies.
"Tonight in Iraq, Saddam walks amidst ruin," Mr. Bush said, referring to Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi President. "His war machine is crushed. His ability to threaten mass destruction is itself destroyed. His people have been lied to, denied the truth. And when his defeated legions come home, all Iraqis will see and feel the havoc he has wrought."
The President made it clear that he had not yet finished his bout with Mr. Hussein, when he said: "And this I promise you: For all that Saddam has done to his own people, to the Kuwaitis, and to the entire world, Saddam and those around him are accountable."
Mr. Bush seemed to acknowledge that, now that he had acted so decisively and effectively abroad, he faced new expectations at home. He said he hoped that same sense of "mission" and "duty" would help America deal with its domestic problems.
"In the war just ended, there were clear-cut objectives, timetables and, above all, an overriding imperative to achieve results," he said. "We must bring that same sense of self-discipline, that same sense of urgency, to the way we meet challenges here at home.
"Our first priority is to get this economy rolling again," Mr. Bush said. He called on Congress to act quickly on proposals on transportation and crime.
"If our forces could win the ground war in 100 hours, then surely Congress can pass this legislation in 100 days," Mr. Bush said, but the speech lacked any specific new proposals.
 
Unease on Economy
 The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll indicated strong public eagerness for Mr. Bush to shift his focus to the domestic economy. Sixty-one percent said he "should be paying more attention to the economy" now than he had been, while 32 percent said he had already been paying enough attention.
While Mr. Bush has been preoccupied with the Kuwait crisis, domestic problems have worsened. The number of jobless workers has increased by 700,000, to 7.7 million, since Aug. 2. The number of people receiving welfare and food stamps has risen sharply.
Republicans have been prodding President Bush to capitalize on his success in the Persian Gulf war by moving boldly on domestic issues, but they fear he may squander what they see as a rare opportunity.
 
Administration Domestic Agenda
 The President emphasized the need for new attention to the domestic situation, and recapitulated legislative proposals the Administration has already put forth.
These included grants to local school boards to encourage programs that help give parents the choice of sending their children to private or parochial schools; an energy plan that focuses on the Administration's interest in allowing additional oil exploration on Alaska's North Slope; a civil rights bill that has been the center of an angry battle between the White House and civil rights groups; a crime program that includes increased penalties for repeat offenders who use guns, and a new highway bill.
Many members of Congress have argued that Mr. Bush's agenda is unimaginative and meager. These legislators contend that civil rights and social welfare legislation are needed in the nation to which members of the armed forces will return. Often, they quote Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister at the end of World War I, who said that he wanted to make Britain "a fit country for heroes to live in."
 
'Four Key Challenges'
 Mr. Bush outlined what he called "the four key challenges" that needed to be met in the Middle East.
He said the allied coalition must work together "to create shared security arrangements in the region."
"Our friends and allies in the Middle East recognize that they will bear the bulk of the responsibility for regional security," he said.
Working to secure the peace in the region, he said, "does not mean stationing U.S. ground forces on the Arabian Peninsula, but it does mean American participation in joint exercises involving both air and ground forces. And it means maintaining a capable U.S. naval presence in the region, just as we have for over 40 years."
Second, he said, the allies must act to control the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missiles in the region. "It would be tragic now, in the wake of war, to embark on a new arms race," he said. "Until Iraq convinces the world of its peaceful intentions -- that its leaders will not use new revenues to rearm and rebuild its menacing war machine -- Iraq must not have access to the instruments of war."
 
Arab-Israeli Conflict
 Third, he said, America must pursue new opportunities for peace in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
"All of us know the depth of bitterness that has made the dispute between Israel and its neighbors so painful and intractable," he said. "Yet, in the conflict just concluded, Israel and many of the Arab states have for the first time found themselves confronting the same aggressor.
"By now, it should be plain to all parties that peacemaking in the Middle East requires compromise," he said, adding that there must be "legitimate Palestinian political rights."
Finally, Mr. Bush said, "We must foster economic development for the sake of peace and progress."

U.S. Withdrawal Plans
 WASHINGTON, March 6 (AP) -- The Pentagon said tonight that 7,168 American servicemen and women would begin the initial withdrawal of American forces from the Persian Gulf, arriving at their home bases on Friday and Saturday.
Over all, the earliest redeployments will total more than 14,000 troops: 7,386 Army, the Air Force 1,854, the Navy 2,177 and the Marines 2,900.
In addition to the contingent from the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division, some 900 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division, and detachments from the 2d Armored Division and the 197th Separate Brigade will be among the first soldiers coming back to the United States, officials said.

HEADLINE: Tape of Beating by Police Revives Charges of Racism

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 6

 BODY:
A two-minute amateur videotape of the beating of a black motorist by a group of police officers has jarred Los Angeles and revived charges that the police department has failed to confront an alleged pattern of police brutality and official abuse of minorities among its officers.
The videotape, which shows officers taking turns swinging their nightsticks like baseball bats at the man and kicking him in the head as he lay on the ground early Sunday, also brought renewed criticism of Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who has aroused controversy with his comments on race and drugs. 
 The victim of the beating, Rodney Glen King, 25 years old, was released this evening with no charges filed against him. Looking bruised and battered, he described the incident to reporters, saying, "I'm just glad I'm not dead."
Speaking from a wheelchair and wearing a cast on one ankle, Mr. King said, "I was scared for my life, so I lay down real calmly and took it like a man."
Robert Rentzer, Mr. King's lawyer, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying that the police had wanted prosecutors to bring charges of battery on an officer and resisting arrest.
Don Eastman, a deputy District Attorney, said that the police had failed to support the contention that Mr. King resisted arrest and that his office had sent the case back to the police for further investigation, the A.P. reported.
As the videotape was played and replayed on local and network television, investigations were announced by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office and the police department's Internal Affairs Division.
Mayor Tom Bradley, a former police officer, said he was outraged and called for a thorough investigation.
 
Officers Off Field Duty
 The Mayor said the police officers involved had been taken off field duty pending the outcome of the investigations. "They are on other assignments," he said. "They are not going to be working the streets and dealing with the public."
Noting that Chief Gates was a civil servant whose job was protected by law, Mr. Bradley stopped short of calling for the chief's removal, saying, "He must choose when the time has come for him to retire."
Civil rights organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and black and Hispanic advocacy groups joined in the public condemnation, saying there was a pattern of violence and racial abuse among Los Angeles law-enforcement agencies.
The public affairs office of the Police Department did not return telephone calls today for comment on the incident. It was not known if any of the officers involved were black.
 
F.B.I. Inquiry on Rights
 Two City Council members demanded that hearings begin immediately into the incident and into the broader questions of police conduct that it raises.
A spokesman for the F.B.I., Fred Reagan, said the bureau was investigating possible civil rights violations. At the District Attorney's office, a spokeswoman, Sandi Gibbons, said it was considering filing criminal charges.
In Washington, John Dunne, Assistant Attorney General for civil rights, said that the F.B.I. investigation would run parallel to that of the local authorities and that his office would review its findings. He said a determination would be made later whether to begin a Federal prosecution.
Chief Gates insisted that the beating was "an aberration" and said it should not cause people to judge the entire department. Police reports on the incident said Mr. King tried to charge at one of the officers after being stopped for speeding.
Witnesses said Mr. King had not fought the officers but had pleaded with them to stop hitting him.
Mr. King, who is unemployed, was hospitalized for two days before being transferred Tuesday to the Los Angeles County Jail for investigation of evading police officers and evading parole. He was released last December from prison after serving six months on a second-degree robbery conviction.
Mr. King said today that he had cooperated with the police when they pulled him over. As he lay face down outside his car, he said, "they walked over and they handcuffed me and tied me and they shocked me, shocked me with some kind of device that they use."
"And they struck me across the face," he said. "After they shocked the first time they paused for a minute, then they struck me across the face with a billy club and then shocked me again on the other side of my shoulder.
He added, "And after that they continued to pound on me and beat on me. All over my body."
His wife, Crystal Waters King, said her husband had suffered a broken leg and that "his whole face looks deformed" from the beating.
 
Tape Is Called Difference
 "It's horrible," said Karol Heppe, executive director of the Police Misconduct Lawyers Referral Service, after viewing the tape. The tape shows some of about a dozen police officers jostling each other to take turns beating the man, inflicting more than 30 blows with nightsticks and a number of kicks.
"It's horrible, but I must tell you that we receive complaints in this office of that kind of conduct on a weekly basis, if not on a daily basis," she said of the private civil rights organization. "The difference this time is that there was somebody there to videotape it. That's the only difference."
Ms. Heppe said complaints of abuses by the city's 8,400-member police department have risen steadily in recent years, though prosecutions of police officers remain rare.
In one of the most recent cases, she said, Joe Morgan, a member of the baseball Hall of Fame, was awarded $540,000 by a jury on Feb. 14 after being detained and physically abused by policemen who accused him of being a drug courier. On Nov. 9 a jury awarded $750,000 to the victim of a police shooting.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's office has also been accused of violence and racial discrimination. In one pending case the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. said deputies in the Lynwood station had engaged in 40 documented incidents of "shooting, killing, brutality, terrorism, house-trashing and other acts of lawlessness."
Two months ago a jury here indicted five sheriff's deputies and one Los Angeles police officer for incidents of brutality and theft and for coverups while they operated as a narcotics unit.
In another case involving videotaped evidence, this time shot by a television crew, jury selection was under way today in the trial of two police officers in nearby Long Beach. The two officers were accused of assaulting a black man, Don Jackson, in January 1989.
Recent complaints against the Los Angeles Police Department have also included accusations of racial discrimination within and outside its ranks.
Last January the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing said the Los Angeles Police Department had systematically denied promotions and job advancement to black officers. The formal accusation followed recent complaints that the department also discriminates against Hispanic officers.
Chief Gates, who is white, has caused further irritation among black and Hispanic residents by remarks they have seen as insensitive. In one instance he suggested that blacks die as a result of choke holds because their bodies are somehow abnormal; in another he asserted that a Salvadoran resident who killed a police officer had no place in the United States.
Mr. Gates, who became police chief in 1978, seems to relish the controversy that surrounds him when he makes statements like one last September when he proposed to a United States Senate committee that casual drug users should be shot.
Commenting on the videotaped beating, he said: "Even if we determine that the officers were indeed out of line in this case, it is an aberration. I would hope the public would not, on the basis of this one tape, make up their minds about the Los Angeles police."
 
Victim Called Cooperative
 George Holliday, 31 years old, an amateur photographer, said he began taping with his newly purchased video camera after he and his wife saw about 10 police cars stop a white sedan across the street from their second-floor apartment at about 1 A.M. Sunday.
The police later said they had pursued the car after it was observed speeding on the Foothill Freeway at up to 115 miles an hour. Mr. Holliday's apartment is in Lakeview Terrace, a community in the San Fernando Valley 20 miles from downtown Los Angeles.
"Before they started hitting him, he was pretty much cooperative," Mr. Holliday said. "It was a weird feeling. I was trying to think, 'What could he have done to deserve that?' "
Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, said: "This is not an isolated incident. We need to investigate not only this incident but the training program, the tone and leadership of the department and the attitude toward minorities."

HEADLINE: Save Gasoline a Better Way

 BODY:
The best way to reduce the use of fuel and clean up the atmosphere is for Congress to pass a stiff energy tax. But the Administration's national energy strategy virtually ignores tax hikes or any other conservation measure, an omission that many in Congress rightly want to reverse.
Yet Congress, too, seems determined to duck taxes. Senator Richard Bryan of Wisconsin has won considerable support for a different approach, a bill that would raise average fuel-efficiency standards for new cars from 27.5 miles per gallon to 40. Mr. Bryan's regulatory approach is tempting, but it won't work as well as higher taxes. That's because fuel-efficiency standards -- known as CAFE standards -- lower only fuel use per vehicle for new cars. But CAFE has not significantly lowered total fuel use. In recent years, fuel use per vehicle has gone down, and total fuel use has gone up. 
 Compared with a tax, CAFE standards affect a much smaller segment of the energy market. They apply only to new cars, which account for less than 10 percent of gasoline consumption. Worse yet, they hold down driving costs. And Congress treats CAFE as a substitute for a stiff gasoline tax, keeping gas prices down.
These lower driving costs encourage people to drive more miles, which offsets part of the impact of higher fuel economy. CAFE also works against itself in another way. Manufacturers may be forced to adopt expensive technologies, making new cars more expensive, encouraging drivers to keep old gas-guzzlers.
Safety is also a serious issue. To meet CAFE, manufacturers sell smaller cars. According to studies by Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution, 1989 cars were 500 pounds lighter than they would have been without CAFE. That will boost fatalities in these cars by about 2,500 and serious injuries by 25,000. True, higher gas taxes would also make small cars more attractive, but less so. Taxes primarily encourage everyone to drive less.
Over all, the fuel savings generated by CAFE standards are small, according to studies by Prof. Robert Leone of Boston University. Energy taxes would be more effective. A higher gas tax would encourage everyone to drive less, buy more fuel-efficient cars, share rides and, eventually, live closer to work. According to some studies, a gasoline tax as small as 5 cents per gallon would achieve as much conservation as Mr. Bryan's bill, but at a fraction of the cost to the economy. A broad tax applying to all fossil fuels would fight pollution and global warming even better.
Congress, fearful of voter wrath over tax increases, could offset a higher gas tax with lower payroll taxes. That way the Federal deficit would be unaffected, one regressive tax would replace another and the nation's needs for energy, and clean air, would be protected. That's the core of a sensible national energy strategy.

HEADLINE: Top Salvador Rebel Alters His Goals

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 6

 BODY:
Moving away from his coalition's ideological roots, the senior military commander of the Salvadoran rebel army asserted this week that his group could no longer be considered a Marxist movement, and added that one-party rule in El Salvador would be "absurd."
In his first major public comments since the collapse of the Soviet bloc, the commander, Joaquin Villalobos, said that his coalition's goals would not be achieved through armed revolution, but through participation as an unarmed political movement in a pluralistic, "competitive" democracy. 
 Describing what he termed an important transformation in the rebels' thinking in the wake of recent world events, Mr. Villalobos said the guerrilla coalition had moved beyond Marxism, which he called "just one more political theory, like any other." He said its military goals had shifted from defeating or reforming the Salvadoran Army to winning a permanent disarmament of both sides under the supervision of the United Nations.
Portraying orthodox Communism as an extreme position comparable to El Salvador's right wing, Mr. Villalobos said his coalition, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, now hoped to model El Salvador's future on such prominent capitalist countries as Germany, Japan and nearby Costa Rica, which has no army and is closely tied to the United States economy.
 
'Cut Off the Extremes'
 "In El Salvador there is a need to isolate or cut off the extremes," Mr. Villalobos said. "In our case that means the thinking of dogmatic Stalinism and traditional, classic Communism. At the other extreme, it is the orthodox right wing, which in El Salvador is something from the Stone Age."
Mr. Villalobos' comments, made in an unusual set of interviews here over recent days, came amid continued news of guerrilla attacks and military clashes in El Salvador as the country moved toward municipal and legislative elections on Sunday. During the last week, guerrillas briefly took over part of the exclusive residential section of Escalon in the capital and attacked the country's main hydroelectric plant in the northern province of Chalatenango, leaving 23 people dead.
The nature and timing of the remarks suggested the possibility that they were designed to appeal to the guerrillas' foreign critics and to present an image of moderation on the eve of the coming elections, which the rebels have pledged not to interrupt.
But the statements marked a striking departure from the traditional revolutionary positions of Mr. Villalobos' coalition, which has long taken such doctine with deadly seriousness and has been considered one of the most ideologically rigid guerrilla movements in the region.
The remarks also appeared to underline what the guerrilla commander described as the "new political reality" that his movement now faces after a 18 months of dramatic political upheaval affecting its key international supporters. Those developments have included wholesale change in the Soviet Union, the Eastern bloc nations and Nicaragua, and deepening crisis in Cuba, which has long been a principal ally of the Salvadoran guerrilla cause.
 
Compromise Now His Objective
 Believed to be about 40 years old, Mr. Villalobos rarely grants interviews and has spent most of the last decade living secretly abroad or in the hills of El Salvador, directing rebel forces against the Salvadoran army and its American military advisers. But he and other members of the guerrilla high command have devoted increasing effort to talks with the Salvadoran Government toward a negotiated compromise that he said is now the principal objective of the insurgent movement.
American officials have accused the guerrilla movement of trying to stall the negotiations -- which began last spring and are being carried out under the supervision of the United Nations -- by demanding a complete dissolution of the Salvadoran military, something the officials maintain is politically impossible.
Mr. Villalobos, whose faction within the coalition is known as the People's Revolutionary Army, has been singled out by American officials as a stronghold of left-wing intransigence. But he defended the guerrilla demand on the Salvadoran military as the only way to break the country's culture of violence and "vaccinate" it against renewed civil war.
"The confrontation has taken place in terms of the fact that one side envisions a reform of the military, while we envision the disbanding of the army and the demilitarization of the country as the best way to guarantee democracy in El Salvador and to give it greater possibilities for economic development," Mr. Villalobos said.

HEADLINE: Ex-Morgan Officer Is Seen As Next World Bank Chief

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 6

 BODY:
Barber B. Conable Jr. told associates today that he would not seek a second five-year term as president of the 155-nation World Bank, the largest dispenser of aid to developing countries.
According to Administration and banking officials, he is expected to be succeeded by Lewis T. Preston, who retired as chief executive of J. P. Morgan & Company in 1989. 
 Mr. Conable's surprise announcement to the bank's executive board closes a chapter of expansion and reorganization for an institution that provides more than $20 billion a year in loans and grants to the world's poorest countries and serves as a pillar of the global economic system.
Mr. Conable, who had earlier served as a Congressman from upstate New York, told President Bush several days ago that he wanted to return to his home in Alexandria, N.Y., where he would be close to his children and grandchildren, bank officials said.
American officials emphasized that Mr. Conable, who is 68 years old, could have had a second term had he wanted it.
Although the bank is a multilateral institution, the United States, which provides 20 percent of the bank's capital, traditionally names the chief executive.
White House and Treasury officials have quietly consulted with other member countries on the Preston appointment. American officials said they expected no major international objections.
According to White House officials, President Bush personally selected Mr. Preston, who is an old friend and who headed Morgan, the nation's fourth-largest banking company, throughout the last decade.
A Harvard graduate, Mr. Preston, 64, is a former marine with what associates have said is a crisp, even gruff, manner.
 
Wide International Experience
 He is a banker with wide international experience. As head of Morgan's London office in the 1960's, Mr. Preston led the bank into the emerging Eurocurrency market. In the last decade, he expanded the bank aggressively into new revenue areas, like commodity and currency trading.
Mr. Preston is close not only to President Bush but also to other senior officials in the Administration. In 1985, he was one of a half-dozen leading bankers with whom Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, then the Treasury Secretary, consulted in creating the Baker plan, which eased the debt burden for developing countries that pursued significant economic reforms.
Mr. Preston took an early retirement from Morgan two years ago, which surprised many in the industry. There was no official explanation. According to a report in The American Banker at the time, he had suffered a mild heart ailment.
As head of Morgan, he earned more than $2 million a year. As head of the World Bank, his pay is expected to be around $200,000 a year.
Mr. Conable was described by associates as "very happy" with the choice of Mr. Preston, who will be the eighth head of the institution since its founding after World War II.
Mr. Preston is expected to take over the World Bank in September. Mr. Conable, whose term officially expires June 30, will remain in office until then, bank officials said.
Mr. Conable has been credited with dramatically strengthening the World Bank's position in global development.
A long time member of the House Ways and Means Committee, he was able to use his political experience to advantage in convincing Congress to go along with a near doubling of the institution's capital -- to $171 billion.
Capital supports the bank's loans, which at $20.7 billion last year, were about a third higher than the foreign-aid budgets of either the United States or Japan.
Later this year, the five-year term of Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, also expires. Many analysts think that Mr. Camdessus, 57, a former French central banker, will remain for a second term.

HEADLINE: Housing in Jersey City;
Condo Tower Rises Along the Hudson

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
Such is the allure of waterfront living that a Long Island development company is betting that the residences it will begin marketing here on March 16 will sell, even in a soft market.
The initial phase of the 525-unit development -- the Towers at Portside -- consists of 203 condominiums in a 19-story tower under construction along the Hudson at the foot of Washington Street in the historic Paulus Hook district of this city, minutes from lower Manhattan. Units range in size from 540 square feet for the smallest studio to 1,800 for the largest three-bedroom model. Duplex penthouses have as much as 3,300 square feet. Prices range from $134,900 to $1.3 million. 
 There will also be 26 two- and three-bedroom town houses ranging from 900 to more than 1,700 square feet and priced from $190,000 to $355,000. They are set atop 31,000 square feet of retail and office space.
The commercial space, divided into 1,200-square-foot blocks, is to be offered as condominiums at prices averaging $150 a square foot. Completion is expected by December.
The project, among the first in that part of the city, is being built by the DeMatteis Organizations of Uniondale, L.I., and Waterview Associates of Jersey City. The architect is Gruzen, Samton, Steinglass of Manhattan.
Parts of New Jersey, like other areas in the Northeast, are still saturated with new and resale houses, especially condominiums. But Nancy Katz, the DeMatteis director of sales and marketing, said her company was pressing ahead with Portside because "a good product will sell in any market, and we feel this market is entering the end of its down cycle."
Phillip Venezia, sales director for the project, said there were several reasons to hope it would attract buyers. He said the nationwide movement back to the cities is still strong, as is the desire to live near the water. The project overlooks the Tidewater Basin and offers views of the Manhattan skyline as well as of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island.
"The significance of this project for Jersey City is that it is opening up a new section of the waterfront to development," said Robert Cotter, director of urban research and design for the city's Department of Housing and Economic Development. Much of the residential development that has transformed Jersey City's waterfront -- once a desolate tract of old factories and rotting rail yards -- has taken place on its northernmost reaches, Mr. Cotter said. Still, more than half of the riverfront redevelopment district, extending two miles along the river and roughly eight blocks inland, is awaiting renewal.
Mr. Cotter said as much as 16 million additional square feet of office space and 12,000 more residences could be built. About 4,500 of those units may rise in and around the Paulus Hook district, where Portside is situated.
Most of them will be part of Colgate-Palmolive's plan to replace the company's old plant with a 34-acre complex that will also include a 400-room hotel and six million square feet of offices. Work is under way on the first 1.2-million-square-foot tower, where Merrill Lynch is planning to relocate 2,500 employees in 500,000 square feet.
Among Portside's amenities will be a health club and a branch of the Jersey City Public Library, which will built in the first phase. There are also plans for a day care center.
Mr. Venezia said Portside's second phase would consist of 296 units in a 25-story tower and 31,000 additional square feet of commercial space, including a two-story restaurant. He said construction of that phase would begin after the first was substantially sold.
The other riverfront project on the market is the James Monroe, a 443-unit, 33-story condominium tower at Newport -- the mixed-use complex that will ultimately contain more than 9,000 residences. The Monroe offers 570-square-foot studios; 1,377-square-foot, two-bedroom apartments, and 2,136-square-foot, three-bedroom duplexes. Prices range from $145,750 to $565,000, said Edward Cortese, vice president of marketing for the Lefrak Organization of Rego Park, Queens, which is developing the project with Melvin Simon & Associates of Indianapolis and the Glimcher Company of Columbus, Ohio.
In October the developers defaulted on a $150 million mortgage for four occupied rental towers with 1,503 units in Newport. The group "is current on all our interest payments" and is working on refinancing the apartment towers, Mr. Cortese said. The condominium project was not affected, he added.
The group is also planning Towers of America -- 750 condominiums in two towers -- in the same complex. A timetable has not yet been set.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Higher As Traders Await Jobs Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished mostly higher on world currrency markets yesterday in choppy trading.
Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery advanced $1 to settle at $366.90 an ounce. The Republic National Bank of New York later quoted a bid of $366.60, up 35 cents an ounce. 
 Traders said the market was awaiting the February unemployment report, due to be released today by the Labor Department. Many expect the data to confirm the growing belief that the recession may be bottoming out.
"It will have a big impact on all markets," said Earl Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
The dollar is expected to benefit if unemployment improves, since the Federal Reserve would have little reason to reduce interest rates further if the economy is recovering. Lower interest rates have a negative effect on the dollar because they make dollar-denominated securities less valuable for investors.
But earlier in Tokyo trading, the dollar fell 0.92 yen to close at 135.63 yen. Later in London, it was quoted higher, at 135.75 yen. In New York, the currency settled at 135.65 yen, down from 135.70 yen on Wednesday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8865, down from $1.8895 late on Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.8885 to buy a pound, less than $1.8950 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Wednesday, included: 1.5460 German marks, up from 1.5380; 1.3480 Swiss francs, up from 1.3390; 5.2645 French francs, up from 5.2360; 1,154.50 Italian lire, up from 1,148.00, and 1.1595 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1586.
Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's, included: 1.5465 German marks, up from 1.5405; 1.3495 Swiss francs, up from 1.3405; 5.2675 French francs, up from 5.2470; 1.7430 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7368; 1,155.25 Italian lire, up from 1,151.75, and 1.1595 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1598.
