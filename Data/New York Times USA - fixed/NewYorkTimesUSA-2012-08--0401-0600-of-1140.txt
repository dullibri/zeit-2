HEADLINE: For a Fortnight, A Stiff Upper Lip Curls Into a Smile

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
SHEFFIELD, England -- All day, people line up here at an unexceptional corner of a town plaza called Barker's Pool, sometimes a dozen or more at a time, waiting to have a photograph taken with a mailbox. This is not just any mailbox, of course. It is a mailbox that has been given a coat of gold paint.''We live in West Yorkshire, about an hour away,'' said Lisa Scranage, a 37-year-old civil servant who was with her 8-year-old son, Ryan. ''We've come especially to see the postbox.''
While there may be little spectacular about the mailbox itself, it represents the heptathlon gold medal won by the Sheffield native Jessica Ennis, who appears in gargantuan, Mao-size posters throughout the town. The mere mention of her inspires almost giddy delight in the residents of Sheffield, a long-hard-on-its-luck northern town perhaps best known to Americans as the setting of the blue-collar striptease film ''The Full Monty.''
In the words of Rachel Dempsey, the manager of the bar next to the golden mailbox, ''This town's gone mental.'' 
After months and months of high unemployment and stern austerity, crooked bankers and shady journalists, and the hangover of riots that set parts of London on fire, the idea of a national revel seemed almost laughable, even more preposterous than revelry would usually seem in this land of sang-froid. Among those whom Mayor Boris Johnson of London calls ''the Olympo-skeptics and gloomadon poppers,'' it was almost a sport in itself to point out every budget overrun and logistical hiccup as evidence of the disaster that would naturally follow on such an earnest enterprise as the Olympic Games.
Even after the opening ceremony, which surprised many for being properly spectacular and deeply, ironically and absurdly British, there were still expectations of a debacle, with incompetent security officials, traffic snarls, apocalyptic downpours, corporate bloat and an embarrassingly low berth in the medal table. Many of those outside London considered the Games a local phenomenon, and a wasteful one at that.
And yet as the Games come to a close, here in Sheffield as well as all over Britain, a patriotic delirium has descended.
''The attitude was, 'It has nothing to do with us up here,' '' said Martyn Boardman, a consultant in town on business who with his phone had just snapped a photograph of the mailbox, one of more than two dozen around the country that were painted gold in honor of hometown Olympic champions. ''But then one or two medals, and all of a sudden, we're at fever pitch.''
The perk-up began with the opening ceremony but took hold on Aug. 1, when the cyclist Bradley Wiggins, the first Briton to win the Tour de France, became the only rider to have won the Tour and an Olympic gold medal in the same year.
''Whatever happens from here,'' a columnist for The Daily Mail wrote, ''it will be hard to top this.''
But the golds continued: seven more in cycling, four in rowing, three in equestrian. There have been British golds won in the cathedrals of English sport, like Andy Murray's tennis victory at Wimbledon, and in events that most people would be hard-pressed to define, like men's keirin. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been seen at events displaying get-a-room levels of affection, and articles have appeared in the news media exploring why the British had not won gold medals in a given event rather than the more characteristic converse.
But what had been a balmy Olympic fever became a roiling epidemic on Aug. 4, when the British had their greatest night of track success ever, with a gold in the long jump, Britain's first gold in the 10,000 meters and Ennis's golden smile coming across the finish line in the final event of the heptathlon. With that, the whole of Britain seemed nearly to come unglued.
''I've been in the Millennium Stadium when Wales have clinched a last-gasp win against England in the Six Nations,'' wrote a sports reporter for The Western Mail, a Welsh paper, describing a rugby triumph, ''but I have never heard such a noise as that which erupted on Saturday.''
This is saying something indeed. While England's St. George's cross, Wales's red dragon and the Scottish saltire are all common sights in soccer season, as the kingdom un-unites in rooting partisanship, a Union Jack is typically a rare find.
That is no longer true. ''I've never seen so many Union Jacks,'' Rachel Dickens, a teacher in Sheffield, said. ''They're on cars and houses in people's gardens.''
The whole display has even prompted a small backlash, mostly in the person of Morrissey, the musician, who to a list of tour dates appended a statement disparaging the whole spectacle and questioning whether England had ''ever been quite so foul with patriotism.''
Morrissey, though, appears to be in a minority. The success of Britain is such that people are tallying up medals not only by country but by county, informing a reporter where Yorkshire alone would stand in the medal table (16th as of Friday night, but 11th in golds, ahead of Japan and the Netherlands and only one behind Australia).
And some have asked whether it is time to finally move past this Victorian business of cheering for a good game rather than a victory, to becoming, as one English photographer said, ''a bit more one-eyed about things.''
''Britain's sort of moved on from this stiff-upper-lip reserve to something a bit more aggressive, having a desire to win rather than just play fair and settle for second best,'' said Stephan Richeux, a spokesman for the Nottingham City Council.
As part of this new aggressive Britain, people are apparently even going to the gym. Richeux said yearly memberships to Nottingham-run fitness centers were up 127 percent over the same two-week period last year. (Then again, Olympian effort being what it is, queries about Lipoglaze, a nonsurgical fat reduction treatment performed at the LoveLite clinic in London, have ''more than quadrupled'' since the Games began, said Debra Robson, one of the clinic's directors.)
In Sheffield, meanwhile, the line at the mailbox continues.
''I've watched a lot more than I thought I would and I watched more diverse sport -- some of it I don't even know the rules,'' said Richard Hill, who came to take a photograph of the mailbox despite being an employee of the Royal Mail and, one might imagine, having seen his share of mailboxes.
''Before the Games, it was the London Games, and now it's the British Games,'' Hill said. ''It's like we actually put on something well, which we don't normally have a lot of confidence about doing.''
Hill's colleague Chris Sanderson declined to photograph the mailbox, however. Someone must stand for the old verities.
''I think it's still the London Games and I think they should keep it,'' he said. ''There's no way to get away from it. I've got to sit through two weeks of absolutely dire television. It's even worse than normal.''

HEADLINE: China Asserts Sea Claim With Politics and Ships

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
HAIKOU, China -- China does not want to control all of the South China Sea, says Wu Shicun, the president of a government-sponsored research institute here devoted to that strategic waterway, whose seabed is believed to be rich in oil and natural gas. It wants only 80 percent.Mr. Wu is a silver-haired politician with a taste for European oil paintings and fine furniture. He is also an effective, aggressive advocate for Beijing's longstanding claim over much of the South China Sea in an increasingly fractious dispute with several other countries in the region that is drawing the United States deeper into the conflict.
China recently established a larger army garrison and expanded the size of an ostensible legislature to govern a speck of land, known as Yongxing Island, more than 200 miles southeast of Hainan. The goal of that move, Mr. Wu said, is to allow Beijing to ''exercise sovereignty over all land features inside the South China Sea,'' including more than 40 islands ''now occupied illegally'' by Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia.
In the past several weeks, China has steadily increased its pressure, sending patrols with bigger ships and issuing persistent warnings in government-controlled newspapers for Washington to stop supporting its Asian friends against China. 
The leadership in Beijing appears to have fastened on to the South China Sea as a way of showing its domestic audience that China is now a regional power, able to get its way in an area it has long considered rightfully its own. Some analysts view the stepped-up actions as a diversion from the coming once-a-decade leadership transition, letting the government show strength at a potentially vulnerable moment.
''They have to be seen domestically as strong and tough in the next few months,'' Kishore Mahbubani, the dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said of the senior leadership. ''They have to make sure they are not seen as weak.''
The Obama administration, alarmed at Beijing's push, contends that the disputes should be settled by negotiation, and that as one of the most important trade corridors in the world, the South China Sea must enjoy freedom of navigation. The State Department, in an unusually strong statement issued this month intended to warn China that it should moderate its behavior, said that Washington believed the claims should be settled ''without coercion, without intimidation, without threats and without the use of force.''
Washington was reacting to what it saw as a continuing campaign on the South China Sea after Beijing prevented the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, at its summit meeting in Cambodia in July, from releasing a communiqué outlining a common approach to the South China Sea.
The dispute keeps escalating. On July 31, the 85th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese Defense Ministry heralded the occasion by announcing ''a regular combat-readiness patrol system'' for the waters in the sea under China's jurisdiction.
The government then said it had launched its newest patrol vessel: a 5,400-ton ship. It was specifically designed to maintain ''marine sovereignty,'' said People's Daily, the Communist Party's leading newspaper.
Adding to the anxiety among China's neighbors, a Chinese Navy frigate ran aground in July near a rocky formation known as Half Moon Shoal, in waters claimed by the Philippines. The accident raised questions about the competence of the Chinese Navy and suspicions about what the boat was doing there.
Mr. Wu, who is the president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies as well as the director general of the Hainan provincial government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that none of China's actions were untoward.
Interviewed in his spacious office decorated with landscape paintings from Italy and Russia, he had recently returned from a day of festivities for the expanded legislature and garrison on Yongxing Island.
Yongxing, a sand-fringed island of less than a square mile dominated by an airstrip that can handle midsize passenger jetliners, is part of what China calls the Xisha Islands. They are known as the Paracels in Vietnam, which also claims the territory.
A Boeing 737 flew special guests to the party, including the Communist Party chief for Hainan Province, to celebrate the newly inducted legislators, and the garrison, Mr. Wu said.
The increased military presence on the island makes the Philippines especially nervous because it thrusts China's presence closer to the islands in the South China Sea that the Philippines claims as its own.
Since the 1990s, the approximately 620 Yongxing Island residents have enjoyed drinking water, electricity and air-conditioning, Mr. Wu said. The new 45-member legislature, which sits in a two-story brick building with pillars and a dome draped with blue and red bunting for the celebrations, is intended to issue laws on maritime issues, he said.
At Mr. Wu's institute, here on Hainan Island in a handsome new building, visitors are invited into a modern screening room where they are greeted with a video that is a policy sales pitch. The video says that China enjoys maritime rights over ''a vast area'' of the South China Sea, though it does not specify how much. The 1.4 million square miles of the sea are ''crucial to the future of China as a growing maritime nation,'' since the sea is a trade conduit between China and the United States, Africa and Europe, the video says.
The deputy director of the institute, Liu Feng, said that China not only claimed sovereignty over most of the islands in the South China Sea, but also transportation, fishing and mineral extraction rights over ''all waters within the nine-dash line.''
The nine-dash map, which appears in government documents and even in Air China's in-flight magazine, is one of the central points of conflict in the South China Sea dispute. The U-shaped line south of China passes close to Vietnam, then around Malaysia and north to the Philippines. It was drawn by China before the Communist takeover but is not recognized by any other country.
On how long it would take China to win back the islands that it claims sovereignty over, Mr. Wu said he could not estimate. The other claimant countries were standing firm, he said. Moreover, the re-engagement of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region ''means we will have obstacles in solving the South China Sea questions between China and the relevant claimant states.''
The sustained attention to the South China Sea has been almost certainly coordinated from the senior ranks of the central government, Chinese analysts and Asian diplomats said. ''Suddenly, the top leaders have taken a more hard-line policy,'' said Shi Yinhong, a foreign policy adviser to the State Council, China's equivalent to the cabinet.
After the State Department criticized China's actions, Beijing immediately accused Washington of taking sides with smaller Asian nations against China. On Aug. 4, the Foreign Ministry summoned Robert S. Wang, the deputy chief of mission at the American Embassy in Beijing, and in an accompanying statement said the State Department had shown ''total disregard of facts, confounded right and wrong, and sent a seriously wrong message.''

HEADLINE: Debating the Choices of the Peter Pans of Queens

 BODY:
In ''A Confederacy of Bachelors,'' on the cover of last Sunday's Metropolitan section, Hilary Howard profiled four men, all approaching 40, who have mostly lived together since college. Hundreds of readers commented on the story on NYTimes.com, expressing support, envy and disdain for the arrangement. A selection of comments is below.I hope they can look back in many years and say it was worth it.
My wife of 23+ years is my best friend, lover and confidant. We have a happy and healthy relationship (as well as normal issues). 
My adult children give me great pleasure and joy. All the trials and tribulations of raising a family were worth it.
For these guys, I only wish them the best, and hope that they live the life that they want, without regrets. But family is something I would never trade a moment of my single friends' lives for. Ever.

As far as we've come as a society, it's clear we are still in the dark ages when it comes to things like marriage and family. Oh sure, society says it now accepts families of all types. But yet we continue to see terms like ''settling down'' (the implication being that if you are not ''settled down'' -- married or in a committed relationship -- you must be an ''unsettled'' person). Or we see terms like ''family man,'' conveniently oft-used by politicians, lawyers, etc., as a way to show a man's ''trustworthiness'' or stability (the implication being that those who are therefore NOT ''family men'' must therefore be less trustworthy, stable, etc.)
I applaud these guys for doing their own thing. Society needs to stop pressuring people to conform (i.e., marriage and kids) and let people do whatever feels right for them.
Avina,

I want to hang out with these guys! Though I've only got one roommate, I'm in my mid-30s, and this is essentially my current lifestyle. I don't know if it's my forever lifestyle -- but the beauty is, it doesn't have to be, and I don't have to decide that now.
I know it must raise eyebrows to some, but you should understand -- when you keep your expenses low, you free yourself to make your choices based on desire instead of fear. I don't mean desire in a salacious way -- I mean that you can pursue something creative if that's what is calling to you. At whatever scale. You're less bound to the needs of others. That might sound like ''escaping adulthood,'' but it's not. Adulthood is knowing what responsibilities you are willing to undertake, and shouldering them.

I did this for 20 years in Williamsburg until they changed the zoning, evicted us and turned my neighborhood into suburbia. I remember palpably feeling the shame of approaching 40 and having conversations about being single and living with a grown man. The social stigma is really quite amazing. Now that I'm over 40, I simply care less about what other people think. I do believe that men who are in the creative class, and are freelancers, don't have the feeling of security required to start a family. And this security may be a combination of cultural factors as well as very real economic realities. Perhaps something as simple as universal health care would see this trend disappear. But I will say, for all the co-habitation scenarios I've ever had, none have been more fun, satisfying and supportive than those years spent with my bros.

Why is this even considered strange? They have a family-like group, with mutual support plus independence. Not only more economical than living alone, it is also a greener way to live.
BC,
Belmont, MA
I agree with many of the comments here.
However, what I find a bit disturbing about this article is that it does seem to reinforce how there is a segment of the population that seems to be stuck in a state of arrested development. At some point, I think responsibility should kick in and it's not entirely unreasonable that people should try to aspire to jobs that enable them to save for retirement and/or cover health and other expenses. The longer people defer or avoid doing this, the more likely it is that they will become dependent upon social programs (e.g., Medicaid, unemployment benefits, etc.) to serve as their safety net, and who pays for all that? The rest of us. If the past few years have proven anything, it's that there are increasing demands and strains on all those social programs with diminishing funds to replenish them. While these guys may be living a life that is suitable to them and fun to an extent, there is an element of irresponsibility, immaturity and lack of sustainability involved.

This is why NYC is such a vast wasteland for us singles. Single men here don't want to grow up.

As their landlord, I can attest to what a great bunch of guys they truly are. Of course, this will not stop me from increasing their rent shortly. Heh, heh.

HEADLINE: The Rewards of Patience

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
IN the darkest days of the housing crisis, paralysis was the word of the day. Even in the rarefied world of high-end New York real estate, developers and buyers alike had to put their dreams on hold, at least for a while.The day that Lehman Brothers crashed in September 2008, instantly deepening the crisis, Michael Stern, a New York developer, took his first tour of the 1929 Walker Tower in Chelsea. He closed on the building in December 2009 for $25 million, hoping to convert much of it to condos. But then he made a strategic decision that is likely to pay big dividends: he leased the building back to Verizon for two years while he waited out the chaos.
''The first time I ever looked at the building was the day the world fell apart,'' Mr. Stern said.
A little patience can go a long way. At least that's the lesson to be drawn from developers who have crawled from the ashes of the housing crisis -- or from behind the barricades where they waited it out -- to a Manhattan high-end market that has become a first-choice destination for the cash of the world's wealthy. 
New downtown buildings that were shelved during the financial crisis, like One Madison Park and 56 Leonard, are moving forward again, while conversions like Walker Tower are surging into a market constrained by low inventory, soaring prices and seemingly inexplicable sales to Russian oligarchs and Las Vegas casino titans.
''It is a very powerful moment in new development right now,'' said Kelly Mack, president of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. ''Developers are seeing a very strong opening in the market to really push their projects forward. These two years were really worth the wait.''
Consider how much the landscape has changed. By the fall of 2008, contract signings for new development essentially stopped. By the first quarter of 2009, buyers were too afraid to buy.
''Open houses were packed, but no one could make a decision,'' recalled Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal firm.
One by one, new development projects stalled, because their pricing did not reflect the new market. ''New development went through this period called 'pretend and extend,' or 'pray and delay,' or 'a rolling loan gathers no loss,' '' Mr. Miller said.
But this year has seen a stunning turnaround. Across the Manhattan market, contracts are up 26 percent across the board from the second quarter of 2010, while new development inventory is down 58 percent over the same period.
Things are getting tighter, and that has encouraged developers beaten down by the market to get off the canvas and back in the match. Some 58 percent of the projects that Corcoran Sunshine is planning were conceived before the downturn, Ms. Mack said.
Some projects on the drawing board in the boom years -- when even newcomers fancied themselves developers -- have ended up in steadier hands.
Consider the situation at a troubled condo project called One Madison Park. It is moving forward after its original developers, Ira Shapiro and Marc Jacobs, ran out of money and the project went into bankruptcy. The Related Companies, along with HFZ Capital Group and Amalgamated Bank, took title on the building in April, shepherding it through bankruptcy and settling most of the lawsuits involving the debtor, a Related spokeswoman said.
The original developers sold 12 apartments out of a possible 69, generating only $38 million, far too little to cover outstanding debts. Desperate for cash, the developers were looking for money anywhere they could, to help cover cost overruns. Among those still involved in litigation is Ian Bruce Eichner, a developer whom Mr. Shapiro offered an unfinished apartment for $5 million, in exchange for a $4.5 million loan.
Construction has begun again, and Related plans to sell 54 more apartments (3 fewer due to combinations). The company says it expects to start sales early next year. The Related spokeswoman would not comment further.
Other developers are content to wait even longer. Larry Silverstein, the developer of the World Trade Center complex, says he hopes construction can start next year on a Four Seasons Hotel project designed by Robert A. M. Stern at 99 Church Street. It will be topped by some 50 floors of condos (a private entrance for the condos is planned at 30 Park Place). His strategy is to start selling the 143 condos by the middle of 2015, when the World Trade Center will largely be completed.
The project was conceived in 2008, but the developers were able to hold off because they bought the land and paid predevelopment costs for just under $300 million. ''We own the land debt-free,'' he said, ''so there is no pressure of any kind.''
It's significant that more banks are moving back into construction loan financing, developers say. ''It is excruciatingly difficult to accomplish yields today'' in other investments, Mr. Silverstein said. Still, even with the reinvigorated market, the construction loan arena is a long way from what it was in the boom years. Most projects require equity of 40 to 60 percent, said Ziel Feldman, the managing principal of HFZ Capital Group. During the peak, developers could wrangle construction loans requiring equity of no more than 10 to 15 percent.
''There is a lot more at-risk money required today,'' Mr. Feldman said. ''That is one reason why the inventory is as low as I have seen it since the 1980s.''
That is about to change as more projects push their way into the pipeline. Some 1,500 new development units will be introduced each year over the next three years, Corcoran Marketing calculates.
Where will all this demand come from, since Wall Street is no longer as flush as it once was?
Mr. Feldman and others believe the gap is being filled by media and high-tech companies like Google that have been moving into the city, especially into the Midtown South area.
''We are creating our own Silicon Alley here,'' Mr. Feldman said.
Then there is the international demand, which by most indications will remain strong, at least for a while. New York has become a magnet for foreigners who are essentially converting their currencies to dollars and buying hard assets.
Those foreigners' deep pockets are benefiting super-high-end condo projects like One57, the developer Gary Barnett's ode to Central Park, which is under construction and selling swiftly.
But domestic buyers are also circling, and are especially eager to buy downtown, developers say. And as downtown projects go, nothing seems as primed to capitalize as quickly on the favorable market conditions (for the industry) than Walker Tower, the Chelsea building originally designed by the architect Ralph Walker that is now being converted into 50 condominiums.
Sales started a few weeks ago and Mr. Stern, managing partner at JDS Development, which is codeveloping the conversion, promises to deliver the apartments in less than a year. He says he is investing about $200 million in the project.
The generously sized units are being sold starting at $3,000 a square foot and ranging higher than $8,000 a square foot for the top-floor penthouse, which has yet to hit the market.
Shaun Osher, the chief executive of CORE, which is handling the marketing for Walker Tower, urged Mr. Stern to install top-end finishes, like Smallbone of Devizes kitchens, radiant heating under the floors and built-in zone humidification systems.
''We gave Shaun every single one of those outrageous requests,'' Mr. Stern said. ''We were fortunate enough not to have to compromise anything.''
The decision to convert the building into very high-end condos -- about half of which will have outdoor space -- reflects where the market is taking developers. ''That upper echelon of the market is improving much more rapidly,'' he said.
But will patience be enough for the rest of the New York housing market, if the froth at the top doesn't bubble its way down?

HEADLINE: Redirecting Fresh Water Raises Fears For Farmers

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
COURTLAND, Calif. -- On the last Sunday of July, this small town in the Sacramento River's delta takes a pause from the peak of the pear harvest season by holding its annual pear fair. A pear run, a pear parade, a pear pie eating contest and a pear fair queen are as much a part of life's rhythm here as the pruning, picking and packing of pears.But not far from the booths offering baskets of the fruit, and pear drinks and pear sausage, there were hints this summer that something was ruffling Courtland. At the same booth where a handwritten sign advertised ''Pear oatmeal cookies, 2 for $3,'' there were pointed political messages like this one: ''Build the tunnel. Kill the delta.''
Just a few days earlier, state and federal officials announced plans to build twin 35-mile tunnels that would tap water from the Sacramento River at intake stations here. Like highways with no exits, the $14 billion giant pipelines would run under the delta in a straight line and deliver the water to aqueducts that feed water to large corporate farms and densely populated regions in Central and Southern California. 
Supporters say the pipelines will improve the environment of an increasingly fragile delta by replacing the pumps that now suck water directly from the southern delta. More than anything else, backers -- led by Gov. Jerry Brown, who failed in his bid to build a similar project in his first term as governor three decades ago -- say the tunnels will secure a supply of water to California's most economically vital areas.
But opponents, including elected officials and farmers from this area, say the tunnels will reduce the amount of fresh water in the delta and cause irreparable damage to fish and farmland by raising the level of salt water. Much of the delta is classified as prime farmland and produced about $800 million in agricultural products in 2009, but the output is dwarfed by counties to the south, whose agricultural production totaled about $25 billion.
More than 1,000 miles of rivers and sloughs lace the 500,000-acre delta, where 57 major reclaimed islands are ringed by more than 1,100 miles of aging levees. Here in the upper delta, the least urbanized area of the region, small towns invariably described as sleepy dot winding levee roads. There are family-owned general stores and no chain stores. Old Victorian houses belonging to farm owners can be seen from the levees, as well as encampments for the migrant workers during harvest. Vestiges of ethnic groups that built the levees or farmed the delta can be found in this area's fading Chinatowns and Japantowns, reinforcing the impression of an earlier time.
In Courtland, population 355, there is anxiety that the tunnels will threaten that way of life.
''That's our rub,'' said Chuck Baker, a pear farmer who like others here accused government officials and people in the south of ''stealing our water.'' ''They want to take these islands and the way we've existed for 150 years.''
In his living room on a recent morning, Mr. Baker and his wife, Joy, displayed daguerreotype photographs of ancestors who came here from Ohio during the Gold Rush of the 1850s. They first grew melons and pumpkins, panning for gold during the months when the delta's islands were flooded. Eventually, with other farmers in a newly created reclamation district, they employed Chinese laborers to build the levees that remain today. Fresh water from the Sacramento River and the myriad sloughs allowed them to irrigate their farms.
Like other farmers, the Bakers' ancestors quickly found out that the delta's rich soil, coupled with the cool delta breeze that blows in at night, was ideal for growing Bartlett pears.
The Gold Rush brought a pear rush here. David Elliot, an ancestor of the Elliots, another old pear farming family here, imported the first Bartlett pear trees from France during the Gold Rush. Some of those trees survive on the family's land on Randall Island and still produce pears.
''It's a special feeling that I'm picking from the same pear trees that my father did and that his father did,'' said Richard Elliot Jr., 25, the sixth generation in the family business.
Over lunch at Courtland Market, the general store where much of the town's life gravitates, he and his brother Ryan, 22, said that like their peers in other longtime pear farming families, they were attached to the strong sense of community in the delta towns.
Ryan Elliot, who played football in high school, said he briefly dreamed of leaving Courtland to pursue football in college and then possibly a career in professional football. In his early teens, he said, he resented having to work on the farm during summer vacations, but he grew to love pear farming.
''I really dug into it probably toward the end of my high school years,'' said Ryan, who is majoring in fruit science at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. ''I think I just came to the understanding of what this all is and what we exactly do here.''
Increasing salt water would have the greatest impact on farms in the delta south of here. But two of the water intake stations could be built near the Elliots' Victorian home and a 200-acre farm that they acquired two decades ago and diversified with cherries and apples.
''It's all developed now, and we're just waiting for everything to come on, and now they want to take it from us,'' said Richard and Ryan Elliot's father, Richard Sr.
''This is just a lovely place to live,'' he said. ''It's kind of secluded. It's quiet. We've always been kind of left alone until now.''
Busy with managing the harvest, Mr. Elliot missed the pear fair this summer, though his family made it. His wife, Rebecca, recalled that Ryan won the pear pie eating contest when he was 5 or 6.
As the midday sun began to reach its full power, Ms. Elliot watched the pear parade from a folding chair with her daughter Rachel, the 2010 pear fair queen, sometimes sitting on her lap.
The grand marshals, Doug and Cathy Hemly, the head of another old pear farming family, sat inside large carts pulled by a red tractor. ''Courtland,'' read a yellow handwritten sign on the side of the cart, ''is in pearadise.''

HEADLINE: A Rebound That's Defying the Old Rules

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine.

 BODY:
AT first blush, it may look as if stocks are following a similar pattern to that of the last two years: the market sinks in the spring, then bounces back in the summer amid signs that the economy is getting past a rough patch.Since late June, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has surged 7 percent and is now nearing its post-recovery highs after faltering in April.
''But this rally feels very different,'' said Mark R. Freeman, chief investment officer at the asset management firm Westwood Holdings Group. 
In past such rebounds, the sectors that performed the best were clearly the so-called risk-on groups -- those, like financials, that are among the most economically sensitive sectors and respond well when investors are embracing riskier bets.
This time around, it's been much more of a mixed bag. At the broad, sector level, defensive, ''risk off'' groups like telecommunications and consumer staples have outperformed the S.& P. 500. But within some sectors, several economically sensitive industry groups have also been thriving. Over the last month, for instance, shares of broadcasters, apparel retailers and real estate investment trusts have also been leading the market, according to Morningstar.
What does all of this say?
''It tells me there's a clear preference among investors to take on more risk, but in a more thoughtful way,'' Mr. Freeman said, noting that in the last year or two, it almost seemed that a switch was flipped in the market. ''Before, the attitude was, 'Greece just got a new prime minister -- let me buy the basket of stocks with the highest global cyclical exposure.' ''
This time, ''there's greater nuance,'' he said. For example, investors are noticing that the fundamentals of the United States housing market are improving, so they're betting on stocks that will benefit from improvement in that and other areas of the domestic economy.
Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, agrees.
''We're not seeing that same black-and-white risk-on, risk-off modality'' as in years past, he said. ''Some selectivity has crept into the market.''
For investors, this means that the markets could be entering a phase when stock selectivity takes on more importance. In risk-on periods in recent years, for example, ''it didn't matter if you picked Exxon or Halliburton, just as long as you were in economically sensitive stocks,'' Mr. Luschini said. Today, however, ''investors have to be more discerning to be rewarded.''
Ultimately, greater stock selectivity is a healthy sign for the market, said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management. For one thing, it means that instead of acting simply on their fears and hopes, investors are paying attention to the fundamentals, such as earnings growth and valuations.
It also means that there are enough signs of fundamental improvement in the economy for investors to get past their fears of another economic slowdown.
The employment report for July, showing that the economy had created a greater-than-expected 163,000 jobs, confirmed that the labor market was improving, albeit slowly. What's more, bank lending and consumer confidence are rising again.
And Mr. Paulsen noted that for the first time during this recovery, there are real signs that the housing market is actually improving. For instance, home prices in June rose 2.5 percent over the same period in 2011, according to CoreLogic, which tracks real estate data. Strip distressed homes from that calculation, and prices jumped 3.2 percent.
Every economic recovery in the postwar era has coincided with improvements in housing -- except this one -- he noted.
''This may finally be changing,'' Mr. Paulsen said, adding that this could also bode well for the job market.
EDWIN DENSON, co-manager of the William Blair Macro Allocation fund, said that from a purely fundamental point of view, ''riskier assets should continue to do well,'' as the economy gradually expands in the next few years.
But it would be foolish, Mr. Denson said, to assume that fear won't make a comeback from time to time, given all the uncertainties ahead.
Next month, for example, the European Central Bank is expected to reveal its nonstandard policy prescriptions to save the euro, which could alleviate or exacerbate fears over the region's debt crisis. That same month, the German courts are set to rule on the constitutionality of that nation's participation in the European Stability Mechanism, a euro zone bailout fund.
In October and November, the focus will shift to elections in the United States. The results could sharply change the direction of federal tax policy for workers and investors, Mr. Denson said.
So while the worst fears of global economic disaster may be over, he added, ''It's hard to believe that it will be a smooth ride up between now and the end of the year.''

HEADLINE: Sometimes, There's a Happy Ending for All

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
IF all you learned about the service economy in the United States is what you read in this column, you'd think this country was managed and staffed exclusively by nincompoops and dummies. This is not the case. Certainly, the Haggler's e-mail skews heavily to tales of transactions gone wrong, but remember, this column is basically one large complaint box.What you may not realize is that compliments -- rare though they are -- show up, too, and in this episode, we take a look at a handful of them.
The Haggler does this because his ultimate goal is to improve the treatment of consumers, and he thinks that the occasional carrot can do as much good as the well-worn stick. 
So we depart this time from the usual format and listen to some readers and their unsolicited raves. Here they are, in no particular order:
I had to rent a car while mine was being repaired, and out of habit I went through an E-ZPass toll without an E-ZPass transponder.
When I received the ticket in the mail, I made a phone call to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which administers E-ZPass. The woman who handled the call was most courteous and understanding. As she put it, ''You did not try to not pay.'' She waived the penalty, took my credit card number and that was that.
You may want to advise your readers to try a polite phone call before a letter. For the most part, humans like to interact with each other. That's what makes us humans.

I know that your column usually features companies with poor customer service but that occasionally you commend a company on the other end of the spectrum. Therefore, I am writing to you in support of the customer service at Apple. I have never called Apple's customer service number or visited an Apple store without coming away feeling satisfied.
Most recently, I visited the Apple store in Towson, Md., in mid-October to inquire about a replacement battery for my MacBook Pro. I was no longer able to fit the battery into the computer, meaning that I had to hook up the computer to its power cord every time I used it.
I made an appointment at the Genius Bar of the Towson store and took the computer and the battery to show to the technician. He took one look at the battery, went to the back room and returned with a brand new one, which he inserted into my computer. He explained that the battery I had was defective. He then fixed a few more minor issues that I had been having with the computer and I was on my way, without having paid a dime.
Apple's customer service is just one of the many reasons I don't hesitate to buy the company's products. Joshua DeLott

This week I was pleasantly astonished. We were told by a Ford repair shop that we needed a new master brake cylinder that would cost about $500. My husband recalled that we had put in a new one in November 2011, but the Sunoco station which had done the repair had since closed.
I called Sunoco, getting its number from its Web site, and reached a live person immediately. I was directed to warranty services, where another person took my information, gave me a file number and asked the Ford repair shop to call him. The guy on the phone was very pleasant, attentive and efficient.
Amazingly, through this entire call there were no menus, no music, no queues and no waiting.
The Ford shop did the repair; Sunoco arranged the payment. We had the car in less than 24 hours with a payment from us of only $85 for prorated use.
I wish that all car-repair stories could have such a happy ending. Thank you, Sunoco. Joan Aufderhar

A company billed us for $39.95 for an annual membership, much to our chagrin, because I had not signed up with this company. Citibank called us to verify the charge. When told that the charge was bogus, Citibank removed it, canceled our cards, and sent us new cards by overnight mail.
I am not a big Citibank customer, and I actually use this particular card very rarely, so I very much appreciated its outstanding service. Robin Block

Since mostly you get complaints and since mostly I complain, I am writing about Canon's customer service. I have several Canon products, including three cameras and two copier-fax machines. When I have had a problem I have had great customer service -- that is why I have so many of its products.
It is the only company with the exception of Apple where I have experienced such excellent customer service.

HEADLINE: Oh, Bruce, What Teeth You Have

BYLINE: By DAVE KEHR

 BODY:
AS part of Universal's centennial celebration that studio has reissued ''Jaws'' (1975) on Blu-ray in a newly restored edition, retrofitted with a remixed 7.1-channel stereo soundtrack. Happily, the filmmakers have resisted the temptation to replace Bruce, the balky mechanical shark (actually three of them, used for different types of shots) whose frequent breakdowns helped swell the shooting schedule to 159 days from 55, with a digitally animated creature. A C.G.I. shark might have been more convincing for contemporary audiences -- poor Bruce can't do much more than roll his eyes and flap his mouth, like the world's most menacing Muppet -- but the movie isn't really about him, after all.Still, he scared millions of moviegoers 37 summers ago, when ''Jaws'' changed the nature of American moviegoing by opening on more than 400 screens across the country, backed by an intensive television advertising campaign. At a time when most high-profile films opened in a small number of downtown theaters in the biggest markets -- New York, Los Angeles, Chicago -- and slowly expanded to smaller cities and second-run theaters, allowing word of mouth to build over time, ''Jaws'' was the first major studio film to seize on the wider American public's emerging desire for instant gratification. 
For movies that opened in only a few ''exclusive engagements,'' television advertising was too expensive and, in a sense, too effective: those pricey commercials reached a lot of people without immediate access to the product. But the chains of shopping-mall theaters spreading nationwide made it possible to bring first-run films to a wider public, and suddenly TV ads made economic sense. For almost everyone who saw ''Jaws'' advertised on television in that summer of 1975, the chances were good that the film was playing somewhere within driving distance.
Today a release in only 400 theaters would seem paltry. This summer ''The Dark Knight Rises'' opened on 4,404 screens in North America alone, and some 10,000 more worldwide, to take advantage of a media presence that is now global. But in 1975 those some 400 screens were enough to make ''Jaws'' seem ubiquitous, and not just as a film. You could also buy Peter Benchley's source novel, as well as T-shirts, board games and dozens of other spinoff products. The movie was no longer simply a movie but also a brand name, an idea that George Lucas would take to even greater heights two summers later with ''Star Wars.'' The film itself was just one aspect of a wider cultural phenomenon.
As innovative as it was, the marketing strategy behind ''Jaws'' would not have worked unless it corresponded to elements embedded within the film itself -- to the insights and attitudes brought to it by its director, Steven Spielberg, who was 26 when he was hired for the project. ''Jaws,'' in a way, was the first movie by the suburbs and for the suburbs, the creation of a young man who had grown up in new, exurban communities in New Jersey, Arizona and California. It's a movie that imagines a new kind of action hero -- the middle-class father, as embodied by Roy Scheider's small-town police chief, Martin Brody -- and carefully differentiates him from earlier archetypes.
The slight, self-deprecating Brody is a creature quite different from the hypermasculine, fiercely independent adventurer represented by Robert Shaw's professionally crusty Captain Quint, who operates entirely on instinct and testosterone, Errol Flynn on his way to becoming Wallace Beery. And neither does Brody resemble the revised model of action heroism that emerged during the '60s: the self-assured, emotionally disengaged technocrat, like James Bond with a graduate degree, represented here by Richard Dreyfuss as the marine biologist Matt Hooper.
Brody may not have Quint's experience or Hooper's education, but he has something neither of those two professional loners do -- a family, consisting of a wife (Lorraine Gary) and two young sons (Chris Rebello and Jay Mello). His involvement is personal and protective, and his emotional commitment will allow the amateur to triumph where professionals have failed.
A refugee from a collapsing, crime-ridden city (a former New York police detective, Brody could almost be a continuation of Scheider's character in William Friedkin's 1971 ''French Connection''), Brody is not about to allow any shadow of urban angst to fall across the sunny beaches of his new home.
Given the chance to return to New York, he almost angrily turns it down. His commitment is to the town of Amity (''It means 'friendship,' '' explains Murray Hamilton's mealy-mouthed mayor) and the new kind of American community it stands for, positioned between the decaying city and the vanishing rural village.
''Jaws'' remains a wildly disparate collection of elements, incorporating literary references to Melville (''Moby-Dick'') and Ibsen (''An Enemy of the People''), stylistic devices from Hitchcock (including a re-creation of the famous ''Vertigo'' zoom-in, dolly-out shot) and a dose of comedy that, as Pauline Kael noted, owes a lot to Woody Allen's wisecracking schlemiels. (''You're going to need a bigger boat.'')
It's a film that begins as a sort of underwater slasher movie, setting up themes that would be developed by ''Halloween'' (1978) and ''Friday the 13th'' (1980). It's the specter of unregulated female sexuality, in the form of a drunk college student out for a midnight nude swim, that summons violent death from the deep. (And Bruce remains the ultimate Freudian nightmare, both vagina dentata and punishing phallus.)
But by its last act ''Jaws'' has evolved into a boy's seafaring adventure out of Kipling or Stevenson, a transition marked by John Williams's score, which shifts from the pulsing suspense of Bernard Herrmann's music for ''Psycho'' to an expansive, swashbuckling theme that evokes Erich Wolfgang Korngold's compositions for ''The Adventures of Robin Hood.''
What the film lacks is any sense of adult sexuality -- the very element that had defined the New Hollywood of the early '70s. This was a deliberate decision; the screenplay eliminates a major subplot in Benchley's novel, involving an affair between Brady's wife and Hooper. Only a few months earlier Hal Ashby's ''Shampoo,'' with Warren Beatty as a bed-hopping hairdresser, had opened, following the old release strategy of exclusive, big-city engagements. ''Jaws'' and its descendants would put an end to all that, both as a business model and as an aesthetic. (Universal, Blu-ray $29.98, DVD $19.98, PG)

HEADLINE: A Satellite With Great Views of Home Base

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
WHEN Kirsten Sharett met her husband-to-be, he was living in an industrial area in Long Island City, near a raw and rat-infested waterfront.''He worked at the United Nations, so it was really convenient,'' Ms. Sharett recalled. ''But I just thought it was desolate and miserable.''
That was almost 17 years ago, and never in her wildest dreams did Ms. Sharett conjure up a future in which she would be living with her husband and 3-year-old daughter in a sleek rental building on that same waterfront.
''I never even considered Long Island City,'' she said. ''It was like, why? It was never even in my frame of mind.'' 
A significant reason why, of course, is that Long Island City, which has shed much of its grittiness and is now home to almost 30,000 people, has six subway lines just one stop from Midtown Manhattan. That convenience has drawn Manhattanites seeking cheaper rents.
Ms. Sharett, who recently moved into a two-bedroom apartment at 47-20 Center Boulevard, said that now that she had made the mental shift, she realized she was in the perfect neighborhood.
Particularly down by the waterfront, with new restaurants and shops moving in, Ms. Sharett said, she has everything she needs within walking distance.
''They've built a compound here, where my daughter's preschool, the drugstore, the grocery, the park are all one block away, and the soccer field is right in front of us,'' she said. ''We could not live like this in Manhattan.''
It was in 1997, when the Citylights co-op was built, that Long Island City's waterfront began the long hike from neglected industrial wasteland to serene residential area.
Until 2003, when the Avalon Riverview opened, Citylights was the lone tower taking advantage of breathtaking Manhattan views. Since the early 2000s, a half a dozen more towers have been built, primarily by TF Cornerstone, adding both condominiums and rentals.
Christine Ezeogu, a United Nations employee, has lived in a one-bedroom in Avalon Riverview North for almost five years. She said that she had thought the global financial recession would lead to a lowering of rental prices, but that except for a renegotiation in 2009, it hadn't. Since then her rent has gone up by about 20 percent.
''I haven't seen the prices go down in the neighborhood,'' she said. ''In fact, they seem to be going up.''
One of several factors in the strength of rental values could be the transformation of the waterfront -- 12 acres of it so far -- into Gantry Plaza State Park, which has four piers, garden, a mist fountain, and several playgrounds and ball courts.
Part of the project has involved restoring Long Island City's signature gantries, which once loaded barges and rail car floats. The park is still being expanded, in both directions.
And more development is planned. Besides two towers it is currently renting out, TF Cornerstone is building an 820-unit rental tower at 45-45 Center Boulevard and plans a 586-unit rental tower at 46-10 Center. The area, called East Coast, is clustered around the giant Pepsi advertisement that has long been a signature element of Long Island City's skyline. Just to the south, at Hunters Point South, the city is planning 5,000 housing units, 60 percent of them affordable to middle-income families. The first phase of construction there should finish in 2014.
Residential development is also moving inland, brokers said. That includes the Queens Plaza area, as well as the Court Square section around the 50-story Citigroup tower. One of the area's largest projects is under construction in the latter area: LINC LIC, being built by Rockrose Development, has a 709-unit rental tower that is almost complete.
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Boundaries are often subject to disagreement, but those generally accepted for Long Island City stretch from the waterfront north to 36th Avenue and east to Northern Boulevard, down to Queens Boulevard and Van Dam Street.
There are two main residential sections: one sometimes called Dutch Kills, north of Queens Plaza and merging with Astoria; the other, Hunters Point, south of the plaza. Predominant housing has historically been two-family homes -- wood frame or brick -- which began appearing around 1910.
In the more recent developments, the one kind of housing in short supply is the three-bedroom, according to brokers. Despite the groups from Astoria, including mothers and children, commuting into Long Island City, some of them daily, to take advantage of the waterfront park, said Eric Benaim, a resident who heads a brokerage called Modern Spaces, his developer clients still consider three-bedroom apartments a bit of a risk.
Mr. Benaim says he is advising developers to lay out their apartment buildings so that two smaller units can be easily combined.
''At the Industry, a building we're representing that's over 90 percent sold now in the Court Square area,'' he said, ''we just sold two five-bedroom apartments, where each buyer combined two smaller apartments. One recently closed for about $2.3 million.''
But the area hasn't yet reached such price heights that no artist can afford to live in it. For many years, artists priced out elsewhere have moved here, though the art scene has never quite coalesced into a bohemia of the likes of, say, Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Still, there are galleries and museums. And the Museum of Modern Art has a branch called MoMA PS 1, which throws summertime Saturday parties for thousands.
Residents also cite the theater scene. The Creek and the Cave, a bar, restaurant and performance space that has hosted the comedians Louis C. K. and Colin Quinn, has been joined by a comedy club, Laughing Devil. A third comedy club is to open in the Court Square area, said Adrian Lupu, a senior vice president of NestSeekers Real Estate. And there are spaces like the Chocolate Factory and the Secret Theater.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
New-construction studios, which are hard to find, rent for about $2,100 a month; one-bedrooms for about $2,500; and two-bedrooms for $3,100 or more, Mr. Lupu said.
Condos typically range in price from about $400,000, for a studio; to about $550,000 for a one-bedroom; and about $870,000 for a two-bedroom, Mr. Benaim said. There are a few three-bedrooms, in particular at the View on the waterfront, that have been achieving and even surpassing $1 million. As Mr. Benaim put it, ''A lot of million-plus buyers are coming out now, which we never really saw before.''
The more reasonably priced apartments, naturally, tend to be in older two-family homes, agents said.
A one-bedroom would rent anywhere from $1,800 to $2,100; a two-bedroom in relatively decent condition would rent for about $2,500, said Rick Rosa, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, who lives in the area.
THE COMMUTE
There are a dozen subway stations in Long Island City; about five of the stations are just a stop away from Midtown. They serve the 7, E, M, R, N and Q trains, among others. Arriving in Midtown can take as little as five minutes, and motorists to and from Manhattan have a choice of the Queensboro Bridge and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.
There are also a handful of bus lines, including the 103, 102, 69, 100 and 39. Many residents commute on the NY Waterway ferry from the Hunters Point South/Long Island City stop. From there it is five minutes to the East Side, 25 minutes to the financial district. The Long Island Rail Road also has two stops in Long Island City.
WHAT TO DO
Besides the expanding waterfront park, residents like to brag about the trendy new restaurants. A couple of Manhattan spots, Spice and Corner Bistro, recently opened satellites along a block of Vernon Boulevard, the area's commercial strip. Nearby is a new Elliman branch, as well as another pioneer from Manhattan, the medical group Tribeca Pediatrics.
''On that block, it's just boom, boom, boom, you see four Manhattan businesses,'' Mr. Rosa said. ''It really gives people that confidence that things are changing here.''
For the more sports-minded, the Long Island City Community Boat House offers free kayaking. In the Queens Plaza area, the city recently completed a $44 million face-lift, adding a bikeway, a pedestrian walk and a 1.5-acre space called Dutch Kills Green.
THE SCHOOLS
Some schools are overcrowded, particularly near the waterfront, but new facilities are going up. A 662-seat school for kindergarten through Grade 8 is under construction at 46-15 Center. There is also a 1,200-seat intermediate and high school under way in Hunters Point South, where a 22,000-square-foot library is scheduled to open in 2013.
Expecting further growth, public and private schools are expanding. Public School 78Q, which covers kindergarten through Grade 5, has plans for a new facility. Les Enfants Montessori School has expanded to accommodate 100 more students.
The area has a handful of middle and high schools, including Long Island City High School at Broadway and 21st, where SAT averages in 2011 were 412 in reading, 433 in math and 410 in writing, versus 436, 460 and 431 citywide.
THE HISTORY
Colonized by the Dutch in the early 17th century, the area remained rural until the mid-1800s, when it was linked to Manhattan by rail and ferry. By 1898, the villages of Hunters Point, Dutch Kills, Astoria and Ravenswood, which had recently joined to form Long Island City, became part of New York City.

HEADLINE: Jean Merrill, 89, a Writer Of Children's Underdog Tales

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
Jean Merrill, a children's author best known for her 1964 book, ''The Pushcart War,'' about street peddlers in New York who use (nonlethal) guerrilla tactics and savvy publicity maneuvers to fight back when unbridled Big Business threatens to banish their pushcarts from the streets -- a book, in other words, that Mother Jones or Saul Alinsky might have produced had they been writers of whimsical allegories -- died on Aug. 2 at her home in Randolph, Vt. She was 89.The cause was cancer, said a nephew, Larry Gilbert.
Ms. Merrill wrote more than 30 books and a dozen scripts for animated television adaptations of her work. Almost all involved underdogs overcoming the odds. In some of her most popular books, the odds amount to nothing less than the established economic and social order. 
Beginning in 1951 with her first book, ''Henry the Hand-Painted Mouse,'' about an artistic mouse seeking self-fulfillment in a rat-race world, Ms. Merrill created books noted for their humanitarian worldview, complex plots and huge casts of characters, which always included a host of fellow underdogs with whom her protagonist could make common cause.
With their unabashed embrace of cultural diversity and the rights of individuals, and their populist distrust of big business, Ms. Merrill's stories became popular in many public school classrooms in the 1960s, and were frequently adapted for school plays.
One of her most popular books, ''The Toothpaste Millionaire,'' (1972), which was adapted for television in 1974, was about an African-American boy who starts a homemade toothpaste business and successfully blocks the best efforts of Corporate Toothpaste to crush him.
''All of this predates Occupy Wall Street by many decades,'' said Tony Kushner, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright of ''Angels in America,'' who spent two years in the early 2000s writing a screenplay based on ''The Pushcart War.'' ''But she came from understanding the history of labor, immigrants, the struggles of all oppressed people against forces beyond their control.''
(The quirkiness and dense originality of the book -- qualities that made Ms. Merrill's epic tale so compelling -- ultimately made adapting it as a film impossible, Mr. Kushner said.)
Ms. Merrill's stories, most of which were illustrated by Ronni Solbert, her companion of more than 50 years, were noted for introducing settings and situations far afield from the standard landscape of children's books, venturing not only into the business world but also into geographic and emotional places rarely visited.
''A Song for Gar'' (1955) was about the nonsinging brother in an Appalachian mountain family of singing brothers. ''Shan's Lucky Knife'' (1960), based on a Burmese folk tale, was about a boy besting his tormentor by pulling a trick with a knife. In ''Blue's Broken Heart'' (1960), a dog mourns the death of a close friend.
Ms. Merrill, who grew up on a farm in upstate New York, attributed her writing sensibility to a childhood spent largely beyond the reach of grown-ups and the toys they manufactured. Rather than playing with dolls or games, she said in an interview, she spent those years ''building huts, dams, rafts, forts, making barrel-stave skis, inner-tube guns, roller-skate scooters, bows and arrows, collecting wildflowers and fossil rocks, swimming, tobogganing, climbing silos, riding hay wagons.''
Jean Fairbanks Merrill was born on Jan. 27, 1923, in Rochester, one of two children of Earl and Elsie Merrill, who operated a dairy farm on the shore of Lake Ontario, in the town of Webster. She graduated from Allegheny College and received a master's degree in English from Wellesley College in 1945 before finding work as an editor for Scholastic Magazine.
Besides Ms. Solbert and her nephew, her survivors include a sister, Marjorie Skott, and two other nephews.
In 1952 she received a Fulbright Fellowship to study folklore at the University of Madras in India. She later based several of her books on Asian folk stories, including ''Shan's Lucky Knife,'' ''The Girl Who Loved Caterpillars'' (1992) and ''The Superlative Horse'' (1961), based on a Chinese folk tale, for which she won the first of two Lewis Carroll Shelf Awards.
She won the second in 1965 for ''The Pushcart War.'' The idea for that book had brewed in her for years, while she lived in Greenwich Village, she told interviewers. She found the volume of truck traffic oppressive, and had entertained fantasies about blowing out the trucks' tires with a peashooter. In an epiphany one day, she said, she told herself, ''What you feel about the trucks is what everybody feels about bullies.'' Then she began writing.
In the book, which takes the form of a historical account written 10 years after the events, Ms. Merrill's heroes employ a series of increasingly clever strategies in waging their war, beginning with peashooters.

HEADLINE: At Root of Italy Library's Plunder, a Tale of Entrenched Practices

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

 BODY:
NAPLES, Italy -- For months now, the alarm has been resounding throughout the insular and competitive world of antiquarian books: beware of volumes bearing the stamp of the storied Girolamini Library in Naples. They could be hot.The library's former director, Marino Massimo De Caro, was arrested in May, accused of systematically despoiling the library he had been charged with keeping safe, stealing books and selling them on the open market or directly to collectors. And sharp sleuthing on the part of a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta has raised questions about Mr. De Caro and the sale of other, possibly forged, books.
The unraveling of Mr. De Caro was precipitated by a chance visit to the library in March by Tomaso Montanari, a professor of art history at the University of Naples and a regular contributor to the daily newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano. What he saw there -- books piled haphazardly throughout and empty shelves, soda cans and garbage strewed about -- immediately went into print, and that prompted a petition signed by hundreds of Italian intellectuals questioning Mr. De Caro's appointment as director. 
More important, Italian prosecutors took note and weeks later Mr. De Caro was in prison, accused of -- but not yet formally charged with -- embezzlement and conspiracy. Prosecutors say that in the 11 months during which he managed the library, Mr. De Caro stole hundreds of its volumes. Investigators found boxes of valuable books, many with the library's stamp, in garages and private homes in several cities as well as in auction houses abroad. Four people said to have conspired with Mr. De Caro were also jailed.
''So far, we've tracked down some 3,000 books,'' including some blocked at auction, said Giovanni Melillo, the Naples prosecutor handling the Girolamini investigation, in an interview. He said that Mr. De Caro was the head of a criminal gang created to despoil the library, which had been off limits to the public -- with few exceptions -- for decades. ''There was a lucidly conceived plan behind it all,'' Mr. Melillo said.
Prosecutors say that Mr. De Caro has admitted to taking some books with the intent to sell them, but solely to pay for the restoration of the underfinanced library and its precious volumes. Mr. De Caro's lawyers declined to comment while investigators were still at work.
The question of how Mr. De Caro ever became the director of such a renowned library sheds light on some of the entrenched practices that continue to bedevil the Italian economy.
In April 2011, Giancarlo Galan, then the culture minister, named Mr. De Caro as his special consultant, and he was reappointed in December by the current minister, Lorenzo Ornaghi. In June 2011, the Culture Ministry ratified his appointment to the library.
''It was like putting a fox in a chicken coop,'' Mr. Melillo said dryly.
Mr. De Caro may not have had a degree in library sciences, but he had other credentials. ''De Caro is the quintessential Italian fixer. In a country where the political class still controls a significant part of the national economy, he connects politics with business, and vice versa,'' said Claudio Gatti, a co-author of a new book, ''Il Sottobosco'' (''The Underworld'').
''People like him exist all over the world, but here we have a twist,'' Mr. Gatti wrote. Mr. De Caro ''can count on relationships with both the right and the left.''
''Only in Italy can you have someone like him,'' he concluded.
One serious problem facing investigators here is that they do not know the exact number of books that may have been stolen. Only half of the 170,000 or so books in the collection were ever cataloged, according to Mauro Giancaspro, the director of the National Library of Naples.
After Mr. De Caro took over last summer he began to move books from their shelves and between rooms, to preserve the books and rid the shelves of wood worms, he told investigators. Instead, prosecutors believe, the books were rearranged and index cards were destroyed to make it difficult to track missing volumes.
The investigation, Mr. Melillo said recently, has taken an ''international bent,'' and his team is following new leads.
Mr. De Caro, whose résumé boasts a colorful employment history, had at least one academic credential under his belt: he had published a two-volume study of Galileo. That is one connection to the Georgia State professor, Nick Wilding, a Galileo expert who is currently investigating the authenticity of several books by the Pisan astronomer.
One in particular, a copy of ''Sidereus Nuncius,'' Galileo's novel observations of the cosmos first published in Venice in 1610 and now owned by a New York rare-book dealer, is clearly a forgery, Mr. Wilding says.
The book in question -- supposedly containing an inscription by Galileo, along with five of his watercolors -- was presented with much fanfare (and some doubts about its authenticity) in Padua five years ago. A two-volume study published last year concluded that it was Galileo's autographed proof copy.
''It all seemed very convincing,'' Mr. Wilding said. ''The paper appeared genuine, the binding seemed convincing.'' But there were ''minor details that made me question the entire account,'' he said in a phone interview. He decided to look more carefully at the book.
The breakthrough came when he discovered photographs of a copy of ''Sidereus Nuncius'' published in a 2005 catalog from Sotheby's. Looking at the photograph of the title page, he noticed that what should have been random ink blots were identical to deeply impressed marks in the New York ''Sidereus Nuncius.''
In addition, one letter in both copies had the same blotch on its foot. This blotch was not in any genuine copy, but was to be found in a facsimile edition published in 1964. The facsimile used a copy that had a brown mark on the paper next to the letter. The black-and-white photograph transformed it into a printed blotch, proving to Mr. Wilding that the New York and Sotheby's copies were both forgeries based on the 1964 facsimile.
''If they hadn't been greedy enough to make two copies, I wouldn't have been able to prove the forgery,'' he said.
The quality of the books, in any case, has amazed the experts.
''We've seen missing pages replaced in facsimile, but no one dreamed that an entire book could be forged, something that is now more easily possible because of modern technology,'' said Owen Gingerich, professor emeritus of astronomy and the history of science at Harvard and a senior astronomer emeritus at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
Mr. De Caro, Mr. Gingerich said, brought the ''Sidereus Nuncius'' with the forged watercolors to his office in 2005, when he was trying to sell the book. ''I told him that the watercolors could not have been made by Galileo because of an astronomical blunder in one of the drawings,'' he said.
Mr. Gingerich and Frank Mowery, of the Folger Library, have detected what Mr. Gingerich said were other forged titles, including three copies of another Galileo book, ''Le Operazioni del Compasso Geometrico e Militare,'' from 1606. At least one of these passed through Mr. De Caro's hands, Mr. Gingerich said.
''I don't know if he commissioned them, or manufactured them, bought them repeatedly or was just unlucky,'' Mr. Wilding said of Mr. De Caro. ''I am worried that these are not the only ones in circulation.''
Arnoud Gerits, president of the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers, recently issued a statement warning members about the theft of books from the Girolamini Library, along with Mr. Wilding's findings of what he has called forged Galileo materials that ''appear to trace back'' to Mr. De Caro. ''It seems clear that this is a major case of both theft and forgeries of important material,'' the statement read.
''Dealers don't want to blow the whistle,'' said Mr. Wilding, who nonetheless welcomed the association's alerts. ''But one dealer also quipped that any rare book that's worth selling has been stolen at least once in its life, hopefully not recently.''

HEADLINE: In Defense of Single Motherhood

BYLINE: By KATIE ROIPHE. 
The author of the forthcoming book ''In Praise of Messy Lives'' and a journalism professor at New York University.

 BODY:
IN a season of ardent partisan clashing, Americans seem united in at least one shared idea: Single mothers are bad. A Pew Research Center poll on family structures reports that nearly 7 in 10 Americans think single mothers are a ''bad thing for society.''Conservatives obsess over moral decline, and liberals worry extravagantly -- and one could argue condescendingly -- about children, but all exhibit a fundamental lack of imagination about what family can be -- and perhaps more pressingly -- what family is: we now live in a country in which 53 percent of the babies born to women under 30 are born to unmarried mothers.
I happen to have two children with two different fathers, neither of whom I live with, and both of whom we are close to. I am lucky enough to be living in financially stable, relatively privileged circumstances, and to have had the education that allows me to do so. I am not the ''typical'' single mother, but then there is no typical single mother any more than there is a typical mother. It is, in fact, our fantasies and crude stereotypes of this ''typical single mother'' that get in the way of a more rational, open-minded understanding of the variety and richness of different kinds of families. 
The structure of my household is messy, bohemian, warm. If there is anything that currently oppresses the children, it is the idea of the way families are ''supposed to be,'' an idea pushed -- in picture books and classrooms and in adults' casual conversation -- on American children at a very early age and with surprising aggressiveness.
At 2, my son, Leo, started to call his sister's father, Harry, ''my Harry.'' When he glimpsed Harry's chocolate-brown 1980s car coming down our block he would say, ''My Harry's car!'' To me this unorthodox use of ''my'' gets at the spirit of what we're doing: inventing a family from scratch. There are no words for what Harry is to him, but he is definitely his Harry.
The other day Leo brushed his mop of blond hair in front of the mirror and announced, ''Now I look like Harry.'' People are quick to tell me that this is not the real thing. But is it necessarily worse than ''the real thing''? Is the physical presence of a man in the home truly as transfiguring, magical and unadulteratedly essential as people seem to think? One could argue that a well-loved child is a well-loved child.
To support the basic notion that single mothers are irresponsible and dangerous to the general order of things, people often refer vaguely to ''studies.'' I am not a huge believer in studies because they tend to collapse the complexities and nuance of actual lived experience and because people lie to themselves and others. (One of these studies, for instance, in order to measure emotional distress asks teenagers to record how many times in a week ''you felt lonely.'' Is there a teenager on earth who is a reliable narrator of her inner life? Can anyone of any age quantify how many times in a week they have felt lonely?) But since these studies provide fodder for those who want to blast single mothers, it's worth addressing what they actually say.
Studies like those done by the Princeton sociologist Sara S. McLanahan, who is one of the foremost authorities on single motherhood and its impact on children, show that conditions like poverty and instability, which frequently accompany single-mother households, increase the chances that the children involved will experience alcoholism, mental illness, academic failure and other troubles. But there is no conclusive evidence that, absent those conditions, the pure, pared-down state of single motherhood is itself dangerous to children.
PROFESSOR McLANAHAN'S studies over the years, and many others like them, show that the primary risks associated with single motherhood arise from financial insecurity. They also offer evidence that, to a lesser extent, particular romantic patterns of the mother -- namely introducing lots of boyfriends into children's lives -- contribute to the risk. What the studies don't show is that longing for a married father at the breakfast table injures children.
And Professor McLanahan's findings suggest that a two-parent, financially stable home with stress and conflict would be more destructive to children than a one-parent, financially stable home without stress and conflict.
There is no doubt, however, that single motherhood can be more difficult than other kinds of motherhood. In France, the response to the added difficulty is to give single mothers preferential access to excellent day care. Here the response is moralism disguised as concern and, at other times, simply moralism.
The idea of ''single mothers'' may itself be the convenient fiction of a fundamentally conservative society. In fact women move in and out of singleness, married parents break apart, men and women live together without marrying, spouses or partners die, romantic attachments form and dissolve. Those who brandish research like Professor McLanahan's ongoing Fragile Families study and Paul R. Amato's 2005 paper on changing family structures to critique ''single mothers'' conveniently ignore the fact that such investigations rely on shifting, differing and extremely complex definitions of the households involved.
What gets lost in the moralizing conversation is that there is a huge, immeasurable variety in households, and there are great ones and terrible ones, arduous ones and inventive ones, drab ones and exuberant ones, among families of all structures and economic strata.
It's useful and humbling to remember that no family structure guarantees happiness or ensures misery: real life is wilier and more fraught with accident and luck than that. If you think that being married ensures a good life for your children you need only enter a bookstore and open any novel, or go to the theater and watch practically any play, or have dinner with nearly anyone you know. Suffering is everywhere, and married parents, even happily married parents, raise screwed-up or alcoholic or lost children, just as single parents raise strong, healthy ones. What matters most, it should go without saying, is the kind of parent you are, not whom you sleep with, and even that matters only up to a point.
With the steep rise of children born to unmarried parents, America's prevailing fantasies of family life no longer match the facts on the ground. But as the children born to unmarried women under 30 come of age in the majority, these faded archetypes will have to evolve. Our narrow, constricting, airless sense of the isolated nuclear family has not always, if we are honest, served us well, and it may now be replaced by something more vivid and dynamic, and closer to the way we are actually living.
All of the liberal concern about single motherhood might more usefully be channeled into protecting single mothers, rather than the elaborate clucking and exquisite condescension that get us nowhere. Attention should be paid to the serious underlying economic inequities, without the colorful surface distraction of concerned or judgmental prurience. Let's abandon the fundamentally frothy question of who is wearing a ring. Young men need jobs so they can pay child support and contribute more meaningfully to the households they are living in. The real menace to America's children is not single mothers, or unmarried or gay parents, but an economy that stokes an unconscionable divide between the rich and the not rich.

InternationalCHINA ASSERTS SEA CLAIM
WITH POLITICS AND SHIPS
China is increasingly making its presence felt in the South China Sea, sending patrols with bigger ships and issuing persistent warnings in government-controlled newspapers for Washington to stop supporting its Asian friends against China. Leadership in Beijing appears to have fastened on to the South China Sea as a way of showing its domestic audience that China is now a regional power, able to get its way in an area it has long considered its own.

JUSTICE FOR AFGHAN GIRL
When she refused to prostitute herself or have sex with the man she was forced to marry when she was about 13, Afghan officials said, Sahar Gul's in-laws tortured her. In July, an appeals court upheld prison sentences of 10 years each for three of her in-laws. But to many advocates, the small victory masks the reality of the treatment of women in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: Exploding the Myths About Vietnam

BYLINE: By LIEN-HANG NGUYEN. 
An associate professor of history at the University of Kentucky and the author of ''Hanoi's War: An International History of the War for Peace in Vietnam.''

 BODY:
AS the war in Afghanistan drags on with no definitive victory in sight for the United States and American troops begin to withdraw, comparisons to the Vietnam War are once again in the air, 50 years after both Washington and Hanoi decided to beef up their forces in South Vietnam. ''Just take a run through the essential Vietnam War checklist,'' wrote Tom Engelhardt in Mother Jones magazine, noting ''there's 'quagmire' '' and ''the idea of winning 'hearts and minds' '' as well as ''bomb-able, or in our era drone-able, 'sanctuaries' across the border'' and even ''a one-man version of My Lai.'' Although these analogies are particularly attractive to critics -- who see America's battle in Afghanistan as even more futile than Vietnam and advocate a quick exit -- they are deeply flawed.Among the many problems with drawing lessons from Vietnam and applying them to Afghanistan is that the history of the Vietnam War is often completely misunderstood. The war's history is constantly evolving as new evidence emerges, particularly from the other side. Since too little attention was paid to understanding the enemy's motivations, internal dynamics, and foreign relations, we have always had an incomplete and incorrect picture of that war. 
If we are to learn from the past, then, it's worth parting the bamboo curtain that has long concealed decision making in North Vietnam to dispel some ingrained myths of that oft-invoked war.
IT is commonly believed that North Vietnam decided to go to war in 1959-60 to save the southern insurgency from eradication and that the Communist Party enjoyed the unflagging support of the Vietnamese people until the war's end in 1975. But recent evidence reveals that the party's resolution to go to war in South Vietnam was intimately connected to problems at home. Revolutionary war was an effective way to deflect attention from domestic problems, including a devastating land reform campaign, a dissident intellectual movement and an unsuccessful state plan for socialist transformation of the economy.
One of the greatest misconceptions of the Vietnam War is that Ho Chi Minh was the uncontested leader of North Vietnam. In reality, Ho was a figurehead while Le Duan, a man who resides in the marginalia of history, was the architect, main strategist and commander in chief of North Vietnam's war effort. The quiet, stern Mr. Duan shunned the spotlight but he possessed the iron will, focus and administrative skill necessary to dominate the Communist Party.
Along with his right-hand man, the indomitable Le Duc Tho, who would later spar with Henry A. Kissinger during the Paris peace negotiations, Mr. Duan constructed a sturdy militarist empire that still looms over Hanoi today. Their hawkish policies led North Vietnam to war against Saigon and then Washington, and ensured that a negotiated peace would never take the place of total victory.
Mr. Duan ruled the party with an iron fist and saw Ho and Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, renowned for defeating the French at Dien Bien Phu, as the greatest threats to his authority. He sidelined Ho, General Giap and their supporters when making nearly all key decisions.
In 1963-4, Mr. Duan blackmailed Ho into silence when the aging leader opposed the controversial decision to escalate the war and seek all-out victory before American forces could intervene. And in 1967-8, there was a large-scale purge in Hanoi when Ho, General Giap and their allies opposed Mr. Duan's plans for the Tet Offensive. Although the southern war initially rallied North Vietnamese to support the party, it soon became a quagmire. Mr. Duan and Mr. Tho reacted by creating a garrison state that labeled any resistance to their war policies as treason. By increasing the powers of internal security forces and ideological police and subjugating the southern insurgency to Hanoi, they were able to wage total war at their discretion until 1975.
The rivalry between China and the Soviet Union also played a major role in determining the course of the war. China's emerging radicalism and the Soviet Union's lack of commitment to third world revolutions allowed Mr. Duan to tilt toward China and advance full-scale war in the South in the early 1960s. As American involvement grew in 1965, Soviet aid poured into North Vietnam. By 1968, competition between Beijing and Moscow for influence in Hanoi had become intense.
Mr. Duan sought to assert Vietnamese autonomy by launching both the 1968 Tet Offensive and the 1972 Easter Offensive -- moves that Beijing and Moscow disapproved of. In 1972, Richard M. Nixon's visits to China and the Soviet Union marked the pinnacle of Sino-Soviet obstruction of North Vietnam's war effort. Both allies exerted pressure on Hanoi to end the war on Nixon's terms as they competed for Washington's good graces. Rather than waiting for a ''big power sellout,'' Mr. Duan and his comrades launched the Easter Offensive, with the aim of toppling the Saigon government and striking a critical blow to America's détente with the Soviet Union and China.
Finally, it is a myth that America defeated itself in the Vietnam War. In fact, the Vietnamese were anything but puppets or passive players in their war; they shaped American actions in Vietnam as well as the global cold war order. It was Mr. Duan's bid for victory in 1964 that prompted America to intervene decisively. And America's allies in Saigon delayed the United States' withdrawal.
They doggedly pursued their own interests, even when those proved detrimental to the Washington-Saigon alliance. Slowing down American withdrawal in 1969 and sabotaging the Kissinger-Tho peace negotiations in 1972-3, South Vietnamese leaders greatly complicated America's exit from Southeast Asia. Although Washington possessed its own internal and geostrategic reasons to intervene and remain in Vietnam, it was leaders in Hanoi and Saigon who dictated the nature and pace of American intervention.
Fighting the last war is always a danger. It becomes even more problematic when the historical analogies driving current policy are based on an incomplete and flawed understanding of America's past failures. As new historical evidence revises our understanding of the Vietnam War and renders any direct analogies untenable, we can at least draw one lesson: to be rigorous in our analysis of the enemy's war effort.
TALIBAN leaders have conflicting views over peace negotiations, the prospect of reconciliation with the Afghan government, and the movement's direction. With Mullah Muhammad Omar acting only as the Taliban's spiritual head, the opportunity has emerged for an enterprising faction with a driven commander -- as was the case with Mr. Duan -- to unify or dominate the divided Afghan insurgency. This new leadership will inevitably be militant, particularly if America strikes an unpopular bargain with Taliban officials in Pakistan.
And even if increased casualties eventually lead some militants to favor peace, the Pentagon's policy of classifying all males who happen to be in the vicinity of drone strikes as militants could undermine that impulse, in much the same way that America's heavy bombing of ''free fire zones'' and ''specified strike zones'' in Vietnam drove many embittered villagers to join the Communist ranks.
It is also crucial for the United States to understand the role that regional actors -- like Pakistan's security services -- play in internal Taliban politics. While Chinese-Soviet rivalry allowed Hanoi to maintain its autonomy while extracting maximum aid from both countries, the Afghan insurgency enjoys no such advantage, especially since neighboring Iran's influence is limited. America therefore enjoys more leverage in Afghanistan than it did in Vietnam.
Finally, the United States envisions a complete pullout by 2014, but as history shows, our allies may not always comply with our wishes. It may be up to Hamid Karzai's government or its successor to set the pace of American withdrawal from Afghanistan. For as we saw in Vietnam, we cannot assume that we alone can dictate our actions.

HEADLINE: Can Travel Make the Child?

BYLINE: By JENNIFER CONLIN

 BODY:
LIKE many affluent parents, Carolyn Everson, an executive at Facebook who lives in Montclair, N.J., with her husband and 9-year-old twins, is committed to raising ''socially conscious'' children, as she puts it. For that reason she did not hesitate to sign her family up for a trip to Kenya last August with Me to We, a company that offers what its Web site calls ''transformative trips.'' At a cost of $4,195 per person (excluding international airfare), guests spend 10 days immersed in African culture while participating in community development programs and living in ''rustic, luxury cottages.''In Kenya, Ms. Everson's family carried jugs of water on their backs alongside tribal women, and helped build a school. They learned beading, planted trees and listened to lectures over leisurely dinners.
In Ms. Everson's view, the trip was a success. ''My daughters are growing up in a very privileged town,'' she said. ''This trip was a chance for us, as a family, to play a global role in helping others while also expanding our worldview.'' 
Travel -- ''fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness'' in the words of Mark Twain -- has long been a way to broaden one's perspective. What is changing, at least for some parents, is the kind of trip that offers such broadening. A decade ago it was enough to peer into the Grand Canyon or bike through Tuscany. Now, galvanized by disasters like Hurricane Katrina and 9/11, and aware of the insulating effects of wealth, many parents are using travel to deliver to their children potent doses of real life.
Some parents, particularly those who are doctors or educators with a toehold in a foreign community, design family volunteer trips themselves. Others are signing on to organizations like Me to We, a partner company of the children's rights charity Free the Children. And while it is hard to miss the incongruity in spending thousands of dollars to inoculate children against the scourge of privilege, traveling abroad costs money, period; for families with limited time and a desire to help, these organizations fill an obvious need. Me to We has seen family participation double over the last few years, while Globe Aware, which offers trips to 15 countries, had a 100 percent increase in the number of families signing up from 2003 to 2008. More recently, that number jumped 22 percent in the first half of 2012 compared with the same period last year. Chris Clum, executive director of Experience Mission, which arranges Christian mission trips around the world, estimates that 50 percent of the 3,000 to 4,000 volunteers who travel with his 10-year-old organization each year are now families.
Not surprisingly, the effects of children's involvement in service travel are showing up in areas like education. ''Everyone in admissions started seeing essays about these volunteering trips six or seven years ago,'' said Bev Taylor, the founder of the Ivy Coach, a New York-based college admissions counseling service. ''Now we have to tell kids not to write about them.''
Though that is unlikely to dampen interest, keep in mind that such trips can be more complicated than the brochures suggest. Below are some common questions with answers collected from families who have taken such trips, and experts who are aware of the risks and rewards.
How to Prepare?
While exposure to different social and economic conditions may be the point of these trips, it's hard to control just how intense the new experiences will be.
Frank and Camilla Baer will never forget their first days in Nairobi last August with their daughter, Elisa, then 16, and son, Oliver, 12. Before volunteering with Me to We, they took a tour through the city's slums. ''None of us had ever seen poverty like it,'' Mr. Baer recalled. ''We spent the morning walking through these dirt-covered streets, crowded with people living in shacks. It was a pretty serious thing for us to see on one of our first days there.''
Many of the families and volunteer leaders said that nothing can truly prepare someone unaccustomed to poverty for the deprivation common in the developing world. Still, there are steps one can take to mitigate the shock.
Before going, ''discuss the challenges and explain that the trip could be heartbreaking at times, scary and even difficult,'' said Ellen Sachs Alter, a psychologist who recently opened a practice after more than a decade with the Family Institute at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. ''Assure them that you will all confront it together.''
Being prepared for cultural tics helps, too, though for Heather Deyo, such knowledge didn't soften any blows. Mrs. Deyo, whose childhood was spent in South Africa, returned with her four children in 2006 when her eldest was 12. ''The children kept pointing out to me how happy the African kids seemed because they were all smiling,'' she recalled. ''As someone who had lived there I explained to them that smiling is a big part of their culture, but it didn't mean they weren't also hungry and dying.''
How Young Is Too Young?
''Parents are the only ones who can decide if their kids are ready for this type of travel,'' said Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz, president of the Child Mind Institute in New York. ''But generally, I think during the teen years, a time when most kids are very self-absorbed, it is not a bad thing to take them out of their comfort zone.''
But as Kimberly Haley-Coleman, executive director of GlobeAware, points out, trips involving animals or playing with children are less of a cultural leap for families with young offspring. ''Costa Rica, for example, is a great first service trip for a family,'' she said. ''You don't need shots to go there, the people dress similarly, the food is not that different from ours, and the time zone is the same, making it much easier for smaller children to adapt.''
Kristy Clum, the wife of Chris Clum of Experience Mission, said she discourages parents from bringing children under 10. ''I tell them you always have to be a mom first, and you will feel a tug of war about volunteering and not having a good experience if your child is unable to cope with discomfort.''
How Much Is Too Much?
''I draw the line at my kids seeing a dead body,'' said Mrs. Deyo, who, since arriving in South Africa has established her own mission project on the Eastern Cape. ''My son has sadly seen women dying of AIDS and the most intense poverty. I don't want it to be about shock and awe, but this is a reality none of us should ignore.''
Still, it is a good idea to expect the unexpected, as things may go awry, and quickly.
Pam Spring-Feldeisen, who has assisted on medical missions in Peru and Haiti (though she is not a doctor), said things ''got a bit dicey'' on a recent trip to Haiti with her 18-year-old son, Thane. On the day they were leaving, their bus to the airport got trapped in a protest. ''I could hear gun shots and was begging some of the other volunteers to promise to get my son out of there, no matter what happened to me,'' she said, explaining that eventually they were allowed through the roadblock.
Her son remembers his mother's fear. ''It was the most scared she has ever been on any of our trips,'' said Thane, who was also shaken by the event.
Neither Mrs. Deyo nor Mrs. Spring-Feldeisen were traveling with a volunteer tour group; both had organized their trips through religious partnerships. Genevieve Brown, executive director of the International Volunteer Programs Association, a consortium of nongovernment organizations, believes the level of danger is usually lower when you travel with one of their member organizations, as opposed to a mission or church group.
''Our nonprofit members must keep staff on the ground in the places where they operate,'' she said. ''They speak the language, know the culture and the political situation.''
Mrs. Deyo, however, emphasizes that her mission organization in South Africa now has four staff people there, which has made things much easier. Similarly, groups like Experience Mission say that while they don't have dedicated staff members on the ground, they do partner with local organizations and churches, which provide inside knowledge of the area.
What Happens if You Get Sick Or Hurt?
In 2008, Kristen Smith, then 14, accompanied her mother, Dr. Lynn Million, a physician at Stanford, on a medical mission near Mombasa, Kenya. Despite taking the anti-malarial medication they needed before leaving, Kristen contracted the disease.
Luckily, Dr. Million had antibiotics and her daughter quickly recovered. The larger point is that there is no way to fully protect yourself while you're traveling. So accept that, but also prepare. Visit your health care provider four to six weeks before your trip to find out which vaccines or medications you might need. Medical advice on 239 destinations is also available on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web site (cdc.gov).
And be ready to avail yourself of local medical expertise. Ms. Everson, the mother of the twins, Taylor and Kennedy, had to drive more than two hours to a hospital in Kenya when one of her daughters fractured her wrist playing soccer. ''We were tended to by a local doctor who had been trained in the States and received great medical care,'' she recalled.
Should Service Trips Be Mixed With Pleasure?
Some families may want to augment their trip with time to relax. Instinct might dictate that this happen at the end of the trip, but many find that it's smarter to schedule the easy part first.
Livia Bokor, 14, remembers how badly her family felt when they took a break from their two weeks at a Peruvian orphanage last year, which was organized by a nonprofit volunteer tour outfit called Global Volunteers. ''We drove for hours through horrible poverty and then finally came to this five-star resort walled off from everything else,'' she recalled. ''It felt horrible to be there.''
Similarly, after a week helping out in a Haitian orphanage, Max Deyo, 16, remembered his discomfort when he and his fellow workers found themselves in a hotel eating a steak dinner right before their return home. ''All I could think about were the kids we had left behind and how we should have skipped this meal and sent the money back to them.''
Ms. Everson said she arranged to go on a safari with her twins before their service. ''I didn't want our last memory of Kenya to be of a luxurious safari camp,'' she said. ''I wanted them to remember the kids they met in the villages, like the little girl who insisted on giving them her bead bracelet.''
Does the Experience Translate Back Home?
When they return, many students want to find a way to continue the work they were doing. Livia Bokor donated her bat mitzvah money to the orphanage in Peru ($15,000). Max Deyo has stopped adding to his comic book collection so he can send money to Haiti.
But recreating an extreme and exotic experience can be challenging. Not only are there time constraints, with academics and athletics often crowding out everything else, but volunteering in, say, a local soup kitchen is far less exciting than tutoring children in a bush schoolhouse.
''They have worked on tangible, recognizable projects, like building a school in Africa,'' said Phil Kassen, director of the Little Red Schoolhouse and Elisabeth Irwin High School in New York. ''It is hard to find something in our own city that is comparable.''
Nevertheless, without exception, all of the children interviewed spoke of the lasting impact their travels have had on them. Some wanted to pursue jobs in international public service; others were interested in emergency medicine. ''Kids get such a bad rap for being selfish and spoiled these days,'' Mrs. Deyo said. ''But if you do something that helps shift their perspective, it is unbelievable how they rise to the occasion.''
And yes, there is room to question these trips. Mr. Kassen, for instance, wonders why there aren't more similarly ambitious volunteer organization programs in the United States. ''If we can't help those around us and only those far away, I worry for our future,'' he said.
But Ms. Brown of the International Volunteer Programs Association refutes this attitude. ''There is a cynicism around international volunteering trips,'' she said. ''But truthfully, what we hear again and again is that the greatest impact is on the volunteers. It is a life-changing experience. We like to think that can only be a good thing.''
LENDING A HAND
Me to We (metowe.com). Pricing for a Kenya program starts at $4,195 per person. Me to We's standard itinerary is 11 days, door to door (including travel time). The price includes accommodation, meals and alcoholic drinks at its Bogani location, two safari game drives and transportation in-country, including round-trip airfare from Nairobi to the Masai Mara and ground transportation. Fifty percent of Me to We's profits go to supporting programs run by Free the Children.
Global Volunteers (globalvolunteers.org). With programs in South and North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Pacific (Cook Islands), the standard fee for one week of volunteering ranges from $995 per person in Appalachia or on the Blackfeet reservation in Montana to $2,695 per person ($2,895 for two weeks) in Kunming, China (not including airfares). For each volunteer you bring with you on an international service program, the fee is discounted by $200 up to a maximum of $800 for four first-time volunteers. For United States travel the discount for four additional first-time volunteers is $100 up to a maximum of $400. Through comprehensive community development partnerships, this nonprofit engages short-term volunteers on long-term projects targeted at serving at-risk children.
GlobeAware (globeaware.org). Weeklong programs run from as little as $1,140 per person in Laos to $1,390 for a week in Vietnam (not including international airfares). The price covers food and lodging in a modest hotel and several excursions to local sites. Volunteering opportunities include building schools in the Andes, repairing trails and roads in Nepal, and irrigation projects in Southeast Asia. Each program is designed to accomplish cultural awareness for the volunteers and sustainability for the community.

THE UNFAIR TRADEHow Our Broken Global Financial System Destroys the Middle Class
By Michael J. Casey403 pp. Crown Business. $28.BETTER, STRONGER, FASTERThe Myth of American Decline . . . and the Rise of a New EconomyBy Daniel Gross260 pp. Free Press. $26.
Each of these books illuminates one particular economic story very well, but fails to see the larger and more complex picture. 
For Michael J. Casey, a columnist at The Wall Street Journal, our economic problems stem from rapid financial globalization, floods of destabilizing liquidity, the rise of China, excessive risk-taking in finance and the unholy alliance between bankers and government in the United States. The core narrative of ''The Unfair Trade'' describes how Asia produced more, saved more and then recycled those savings to pump up global credit. America responded by borrowing more money to pay for a consumption binge rather than buckling down and investing for greater productivity. Our debt proved unsustainable and the financial crisis was a comeuppance for favoring present goodies over planning for the future.
But does China deserve so much attention (5 chapters out of the book's 10)? Casey writes that China ''provided the cheap goods needed to sustain the American way of life, as well as the finance to pay for it.'' Yet the numbers tell a less dramatic story. Currently, imports from China are measured at about 2.7 percent of consumer spending in America. Furthermore, for each dollar of imports from China, a lot of that money was spent in the United States preparing the import; imagine an iPad designed and marketed from Cupertino, Calif., but counted as an import from China. That leaves Chinese imports, measured in terms of true net impact, at about 1.2 percent of American consumer spending.
In any case, China's role as a source of potential global imbalances is diminishing. For 2011, China had a trade surplus of about $155 billion, slightly more than half of what it was in 2008. At times this year China has been running trade deficits. For perspective, the trade surpluses of Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea taken together are $141 billion, only slightly smaller than China's. (I'm using 2010 figures for Japan to adjust for the negative impact of the 2011 earthquake.) China as the major player in our grim economic story makes for a useful target, but ''The Unfair Trade'' overplays its hand on this point.
Instead of condemning Chinese trade surpluses, we should be looking at the world's poorest regions, which do not export much at all. Concentrating on sub-Saharan Africa and much of South Asia would lead to a more pedestrian tale, but arguably a more relevant one. What the global economy really needs is to build more markets, improve local institutions for health and education, and support more trustworthy governments. Even the economic rise of China, we should remember, is not a sure thing: the country faces problems from real estate bubbles, provincial debts, widespread corruption, urban-rural disparities and the absence of a clear path to democracy.
The domestic aspect of Casey's story is more convincing, but also more familiar. American finance is broken, our regulations don't seem to be working and the economic incentives too often are ''heads I win, tails society loses.'' One can agree with Casey's call for greater transparency, smaller banks, floating exchange rates, reforming the International Monetary Fund and limiting the oligarchic power of bankers without expecting very much to change. Our pre-2008 institutions were, arguably, the result of an attempt to build a financial world on exactly those principles, which have commanded various forms of lip service for decades. The more pressing question is whether our economy is strong enough to tolerate a slowdown in borrowing from both consumers and the federal government. Many observers fear not, and in any case American politicians, ever conscious of their own re-election prospects, do not seem willing to run the experiment.
Daniel Gross, an editor and columnist at The Daily Ticker at Yahoo! Finance, offers a much more optimistic view of the future, at least for the United States. In ''Better, Stronger, Faster,'' America is entering a new age of business success, driven by our innovativeness, dynamism and skill at commerce. As in ''The Unfair Trade,'' the narrative is backed by excellent reporting, as when Gross explores our resurgent fossil fuel sector on a trip to North Dakota.
His optimism is not unwarranted -- American business has reinvented itself repeatedly, as conditions have required, and we can plausibly expect it to do so again. Yet Gross glosses over too much. The earnings of the typical or median household have risen only slightly since 1973, and not at all since the late 1990s. Gross's gaze is directed at success for business and profits, which will be captured largely by owners of capital. That's fine, but it's not synonymous with an America that is ''better, stronger, faster.''
A look at how ordinary Americans spend their money puts Gross's story in a more realistic light. It's much more expensive to live in a good school district today than it was several decades ago; college costs have skyrocketed; and health care costs have become a seemingly intractable fiscal and job-killing problem. Those difficulties don't receive much attention in this book, but many Americans would trade all of Gross's business successes for cheaper health care and education, and a smaller monthly payment on their mortgages. Gross does consider housing, but his main point -- that fewer people are buying and more are renting -- is hardly a sign of progress. More renters, as Gross indicates, are probably desirable, but what this shows is a realistic recognition of our failure to raise living standards, not a sign of continuing improvement.
More and more Americans work in service sectors like education and health care, which are probably experiencing low productivity gains (we can't accurately measure productivity in those sectors and that is itself worrying). The most probable American economic future is a lot of export success, fantastic wealth for the owners of thriving businesses and persistent productivity problems, and thus high prices, for some major items in consumer budgets. That means more stagnation of real wages at the middle of the income distribution. And if you accept Casey's pessimism about our financial sector, there is yet further reason to worry.
These two books offer plenty of wisdom and some good reporting. But neither is a reliable general guide, and perhaps that is no accident. Our economic future is probably too messy, and too independent of any one easily communicated mood, slogan or title, to be encapsulated in a single book.

 BODY:
THE GREAT INVERSION AND THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN CITYBy Alan Ehrenhalt
Illustrated. 276 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95.
Ever since the surge in crime that began in the 1960s, cosmopolitan Americans have been on a quest for urbanity, looking for a metropolitan culture that had been lost to social breakdown. They sought safety in the suburbs or in urban enclaves, but they were forced to give up the civic spaces, parks, boulevards and bustling street life that had made cities so stimulating in the past. Alan Ehrenhalt's 1995 book, ''The Lost City: Discovering the Forgotten Virtues of Community in the Chicago of the 1950s,'' subtly evaluated all that had been forsaken. 
Ehrenhalt's new book, ''The Great Inversion and the Future of the American City,'' moves in the opposite direction. It is a progress report of sorts on the reclamation of public space and the ''rearrangement of living patterns'' that are now taking place. Cities organized around manufacturing may have gone through difficult decades, he says, but while they lost middle-class industrial jobs, they are now becoming centers of postindustrial upscale living. ''The late 20th century,'' he writes, ''was the age of poor inner cities and wealthy suburbs; the 21st century is emerging as an age of affluent inner neighborhoods and immigrants settling on the outside.''
The title of his book refers to both the growth of downtown living in once forbidding neighborhoods and, contrary to expectations, the movement of immigrants into the suburbs. Cities like Chicago, New York and Philadelphia, he argues, are ''gradually coming to resemble'' European cities like Vienna or Paris in the 19th century, when the well-to-do lived in the center city and the working classes lived in the suburban rings around the downtown.
And according to Ehrenhalt, today it's not even necessary to move downtown to achieve a sense of urbanity. He's right, although he doesn't cite the specifics. New shopping areas like the Glen in suburban Chicago have been built to suggest the feel of an old city center. Similarly, older suburban downtowns in Highland Park, Ill.; Downingtown, Pa.; and Westfield, N.J., have built on their architecture to create thriving districts with chic restaurants, cafes and boutiques. ''Much of suburbia,'' he argues, ''will seek to reinvent itself in a newly urbanized mode.''
Ehrenhalt is most persuasive when describing the texture and feel of gentrifying neighborhoods. ''The young and hip'' are drawn to Brooklyn's grim Bushwick, with its decaying manufacturing sites and dilapidated housing, by low rents and people of similar tastes. ''Art fairs in Bushwick . . . look for all the world like celebrations designed to shock conservative sensibilities, except that there is scarcely anyone with such sensibilities around to be shocked. These are in reality projects through which a small coterie of local artists seek to display their sheer edginess to one another.''
Admittedly, it's not all success stories. As Ehrenhalt reports, despite more than a billion dollars in subsidies, Phoenix, with its large overhang of new but empty condos, has largely failed to build a vibrant city center. If downtown Phoenix has a future, he argues, it's because Arizona State University is expanding in what was supposed to become a commercial and residential hub.
Charlotte, N.C., has attracted dozens of restaurants to its downtown but, despite considerable effort, virtually no retail establishments. Perhaps that's because, as Ehrenhalt says, ''Charlotte, for all the local excitement it generated about upscale in-town living, still has no more than 12,000 residents downtown.''
Ehrenhalt has a hard time explaining what the successes of the new urbanism add up to, though he refers to the writings of Joel Kotkin, whom he describes as ''perhaps the most prominent of the downtown debunkers.'' Kotkin has claimed, on the basis of census data, that the downtown revival Ehrenhalt applauds is merely a niche phenomenon. It is confined, Kotkin says, largely to singles, childless couples, wealthy empty nesters and recently graduated students transitioning to a delayed adulthood.
This argument shadows Ehrenhalt throughout his book. With Kotkin seemingly in mind, he repeatedly qualifies his conclusions.
''It is true,'' Ehrenhalt acknowledges, ''that the return to the urban center has up to now been modest in absolute numbers.'' In recent years, he goes on, ''more people still moved to the suburbs than moved downtown.'' But ''more,'' he insists, doesn't capture what is happening. It may be true that over the last decade, 91 percent of metro area population growth has been in the suburbs, but Ehrenhalt is making a qualitative case, not a quantitative one. ''The importance of the movement'' into downtowns, he asserts, ''rests on the character of the new population group rather than on its size.'' But with that statement, he gets to the heart of what has actually been going on.
The new urban high-end living depicted in ''The Great Inversion'' represents part of a larger social sorting and class stratification that has accompanied the relative decline of the American middle class. Ehrenhalt writes of ''Gazillionaires Row'' in Sheffield, a revived Chicago neighborhood not far from the Loop that's thriving. But this new wealth isn't producing new private-sector middle-class jobs. The largest employer in Chicago is the federal government, followed by the public school system. Other major employers are the City of Chicago itself, the Chicago Transit Authority, the Cook County government and the Chicago Park District.Meanwhile, new private-sector jobs are coming mainly from servicing the expanding urban class and the wealthy. In Philadelphia, Ehrenhalt rightly describes the vitality of Center City, but notes that just a few blocks away in neighborhoods like Kensington the squalor and violence are overwhelming.
Even the successful cities have become top and bottom affairs. For all its new glitter, Chicago, bedeviled by the cost of public-sector pensions, is flirting with bankruptcy. It has lost 150,000 jobs over the last two decades. In order to meet current payrolls, it has been forced to lease its Skyway toll road for 99 years and its parking meters for the next 75. The upshot, notes Aaron Renn, who has written extensively on Chicago, is that the city's meld of high taxes and low-quality services has pushed the region's black and white middle-class families into the exurbs, where they bear the burden of high gasoline costs but avoid paying for Chicago's huge public sector.
Philadelphia is in an even more perilous condition. As with Chicago, the downtown is well policed, but crime is rampant immediately adjacent to the core. Burdened by a wage tax levied on every job, it has a very low jobs-to-residents ratio, and the largest number of abandoned homes per 1,000 residential units in the country. Philadelphia hasn't sold its parking meters yet, but it has tried to force bloggers to pay a licensing fee. Like Chicago, it is in economic thrall to an alliance of machine politicians and public-sector unions that show no signs of releasing their expensive grip.
Ehrenhalt writes that while the great recession has temporarily frozen people in place, thus stalling the return to the cities, the long-term trends -- like the rise of childless individuals living alone -- bode well for the future of the new downtowns. Maybe. The quest for urbanity will no doubt continue among those who can afford to pay for private policing and private schools. But so far, for all the upbeat articles on the clustering of ''the creative class'' and the very wealthy in the new downtowns of Chicago and Philadelphia, millions in the private-sector middle class continue to head for the exits.

HEADLINE: What's Your Life Worth?

BYLINE: By JAMES VLAHOS

 BODY:
'Do you see lights?'' Ruben Robles asked his brother, Mark, in 2007. Bright, star-shaped and white, they flashed before Ruben's eyes while he was driving, shopping at Costco, feeding the cats. Mark didn't see anything, so Robles went to a doctor, who thought that the visions might be stress-induced. Robles ran a collection agency in Los Angeles, and the hours were long, the debtors argumentative. Several weeks later, Ruben began suffering seizures. 
He went to see another doctor, and this one ordered an M.R.I., which revealed a ghostly white orb on his left frontal lobe. The diagnosis was brain cancer. Only 36 years old, Ruben was told that he might not live to see his 38th birthday.Horrified, Robles says he thought constantly about God. But his crisis was practical as well as existential. Over the next year and a half, surgeons operated on his brain three times, excising as much of the cancer as they safely could. The side effects of the operations left Robles barely able to walk and unable to speak more than a word or two at a time. He shuttered the collection agency. His wife left him, and Robles, needing daily help, squeezed into his mother's Chihuahua-filled apartment. The medical bills were mounting, and Robles was worried: though he believed God would provide for him in the afterlife, what he desperately needed until then was money.
Ron Escobar, a close friend of Robles's, went to Carole Fiedler, an insurance expert, for help. Fiedler saw that there was no vacation home or Google stock to unload. But Robles did have a life-insurance policy for half a million dollars. Life insurance is designed to benefit the living, a spouse or heirs, not those who perish. But Fiedler, who owns a firm called Innovative Settlements, knew that a life-insurance policy is an asset that can be resold to a friend or stranger just as a car, boat or house can. In a transaction known as a viatical settlement (for terminally ill patients) or a life settlement (for everyone else), the person selling his insurance gets an immediate cash payment. The buyer, in exchange, is named as the beneficiary and pays the premiums until the insured person dies. Life no longer afforded Robles a traditional way to make money, but to the right investor, Fiedler advised, his imminent death was worth a great deal.
Selling your life and selling a house have more in common than you'd think. The seller puts a listing on the market. Prospective buyers do research and get inspections; there are offers and counteroffers until the seller accepts a bid. The seller doesn't literally peddle his own life, of course, but his life-insurance policy. The distinction is in many ways moot, however, as the sales value is inextricably linked to a cold-eyed estimation of how much longer the seller has to live. In the case of Robles's policy, a life-settlement company in Georgia, Habersham Funding, expressed interest. Escobar shipped off six boxes' worth of Robles's medical records, thousands of pages in all, to Habersham. The firm, in turn, analyzed the records and also had them scrutinized by an external company specializing in life-expectancy analysis. Fiedler's recollection is that the reports confirmed the grim prognosis and that Robles had less than two years left to live.
Fiedler, for her part, tried to convince Habersham that Robles was knocking on death's door. The sooner Robles died, the fewer premiums the buyer would have to pay and the greater the potential value of his policy. ''I would never lie, but my job is to make my clients look as bad as possible,'' Fiedler says. Habersham opened its bidding at $250,000. ''You've got to give us more money than that,'' Fiedler recalls yelling during a phone negotiation. ''This guy is really sick!'' The company bumped its offer to $305,000. Fiedler accepted, and the stakes were set. The buyer's profit would be the $500,000 insurance payout upon Robles's death minus the $305,000 settlement and whatever the company had paid in premiums. Escobar, meanwhile, was hoping that his friend could beat the grim odds. ''I told Ruben, 'Look, they're betting that you're going to die,' '' Escobar says. '' 'You're betting that you'll live.' ''
Betting on when somebody will die seems so creepy that it's hard to believe the practice is legal. Sure, people pay good money to buy life-insurance policies, so perhaps that should confer the right to sell them as well. But the freedoms of ownership are not unlimited, especially when it comes to anything related to life and limb. Possession of and control over what happens to your own body is a fundamental human right. Nonetheless, that hasn't stopped cultures from banning prostitution, organ sales or for-profit surrogate parenthood. The justification for such infringements upon bodily sovereignty is that people should be protected from financial incentives to harm themselves, and you could argue that a life settlement creates just such an incentive. A potential recipient, for instance, could try to win a larger settlement by offering a guarantee -- if I'm not dead in, say, five years, I promise to kill myself so that you can collect the insurance money. That situation is admittedly far-fetched, but history has shown that when there's a payday offered for someone's demise, unscrupulous people will step in to hurry death along. In 16th- and 17th-century England, for example, it was legal to take out a life-insurance policy on a complete stranger, and as the historian Sharon Ann Murphy wrote, ''these speculative life policies too often resulted in the murder of the insured.''
There are no known cases of murder to collect a life settlement-linked insurance payout. The financial practice originated not as a criminal scheme but as a way to help the terminally ill. In the late 1980s, people infected with AIDS often had little time to live and a great need for money. In response, financial planners established the viatical business. Flyers went up at gay bars and clubs encouraging people to sell their life-insurance policies for quick cash. Some financial planners even trolled hospital wards to find customers.
As the 1990s drew to a close, brokers realized that their thinking had been too limited. ''The investors who had started this whole industry realized that the customer doesn't just have to be someone who is terminally ill with H.I.V.,'' says John Kraemer, a life-settlement broker in Southern California. ''They could be anyone with an age or other health consideration that shortens life expectancy.''
Rebranded and redefined, the life-settlements business grew swiftly, reaching $12 billion in transactions by 2007. The recession has since walloped the industry, as have well-publicized cases of fraud, in which unscrupulous brokers persuaded people to take out life-insurance policies expressly for the purpose of reselling them a couple of years later. Only $3.8 billion worth of policies changed hands in 2010, but insiders hope that the business will ultimately surpass its previous high. There are $18 trillion worth of active life-insurance policies in the United States alone, and very few people even know that they can sell their policies. ''The public awareness is next to nil,'' says Clark Hogan, the managing director of Opulen Capital, a life-settlements brokerage in Southern California. ''The industry is in its infancy.''
Advocates of life settlements say that they offer fiscal relief in hard times, especially to seniors whose retirement portfolios have tanked. ''We need to be singing at the tops of our voices that selling your life insurance is an option,'' says Scott Page, president of the Lifeline Program, a large settlement company. For potential investors, meanwhile, the pitch is that settlements offer a safe harbor. Let the Dow rise, let the Dow fall; a death payout is an uncorrelated asset whose timing bears almost no connection to the mood swings of the market. In addition, both sides participating in settlement transactions are winners: the policy seller is paid upfront, and the buyer is paid even more later. Both parties are playing with house money -- that of the insurance company -- and the only question is how it will be divvied up.
For all the supposed benefits, settlements still strike many people as creepy. They invert the traditional incentives of life insurance. Insurance companies have always had an interest in you, the policyholder, living as long as possible so that they can collect more premiums. Generally, you also want to live a long time, for obvious reasons. But a settlement means someone hits the jackpot when you die, and the sooner that happens, the more money that person makes.
Clark Hogan represents people who want to sell their life-insurance policies. To find new clients, he cold-calls financial planners, accountants, attorneys and insurance agents. ''Hey, good afternoon, Clark Hogan here,'' he said one afternoon at the end of last year. ''I'm wondering if you've ever had a client surrender a life-insurance policy and if you've considered a life settlement instead. . . .''
Seller's agents like Hogan say that while it may seem wrong for strangers to profit from your demise, settlements are a resoundingly pro-consumer innovation. In the casino of life insurance, the game is rigged. The industry's profit models rely upon the fact that more than two-thirds of customers lapse -- stop paying premiums -- before dying, thus invalidating their policies before their beneficiaries can collect a cent. People often have good reasons for doing this. A husband outlives his wife, the intended beneficiary. An elderly woman with a dwindling pension decides that she needs money for medical care now more than her heirs will need it later.
Policyholders have only one possible escape route beyond lapsing. If the policy has a redemption provision, the customer can sell it back to the insurance company for a tiny fraction of its full face value. But this option represents the prison of a monopsony, a marketplace with only one possible buyer. ''You wouldn't want to buy a Ford and turn around 10 years later and find out that the only entity you could sell it to is back to Ford,'' says Vince Granieri, the chief actuary at the life-expectancy company 21st Services. Settlements let the consumer shop a policy to multiple buyers and potentially get anywhere from 2 percent to more than 60 percent of its face value. For most people, discovering that they can sell an asset whose value rivals that of their house is a joyful surprise. ''It's almost like finding money under the mattress,'' says John Yaker, former president of Quantum Life Settlements.
Hogan's cold calls that day yielded two financial planners who offered to send settlement cases his way, but receptive audiences aren't the norm. One planner he called dismissed life-settlement brokers with an expletive. Hogan curled over toward the speakerphone as if in abdominal distress but replied in upbeat tones. ''This is the fight I have to win on behalf of the financially distressed life-insurance policyholder,'' he said, ''to persuade them that there are legitimate buyers out there serving an industry that's trending toward legitimacy.''
Life settlements have a dubious past indeed; as relatively new, poorly understood and, until recently, minimally regulated transactions, they have been prime terrain for fraud. The most notorious scheme even has its own acronym, Stoli, for stranger-originated life insurance, which typically targets the elderly. I spoke with one couple -- wealthy, elderly retirees in Florida who asked not to be named -- who were routinely approached to take out life-insurance policies. ''Every other day you'd get invited for a free dinner at a high-class restaurant as an incentive to listen to a spiel on life settlements,'' the husband said. That the couple didn't actually have insurance did not dissuade the pitchmen. ''They would try to convince you to take out a policy, hold it for a while and then flip it,'' he said. The shady brokers offered to cover the premiums; after two years the brokers would get themselves named as the beneficiaries on a policy and then wait for the couple to die so that they could collect the insurance-company payout.
Such a scheme might not seem all that different from life settlements in which the policy seller wasn't put up to the transaction by a stranger -- either way, you wind up having a third party that profits when the policyholder dies. But life-insurance contracts specify that the person taking out the policy must be doing so on behalf of himself, a relative or a business partner whose death would cause direct financial harm. So insurance companies have argued that Stoli is fraud, a contractual violation, and state legislatures have agreed. With the active support of the life-settlement industry, which wants to establish its legitimacy, settlements are now regulated in all but five American states, and most of the new laws explicitly ban Stoli.
Last fall, hoping to raise awareness of his reformed industry, Scott Page created one of the odder viral marketing campaigns ever to hit the Internet. In the video ''I'm Still Hot,'' the actress Betty White sits atop a golden throne and raps about settlements to a bevy of shirtless male models. ''I hooked up with the Lifeline/I got big cash in no time,'' White says. The video has been viewed nearly 1.5 million times on YouTube, clearly a viral victory for Page's Lifeline Program, though the message arguably gets lost amid the pecs and octogenarian break-dance sequences.
To spread the pro-consumer message, the industry might do better simply to run advertisements featuring real customers with settlement-fattened wallets. A client of Innovative Settlements named Arline Maisel, for instance, obtained a settlement for her father after he received a diagnosis of prostate cancer. The family used the money to rent a house in Colorado so that the sick father, his children and grandchildren could gather together for what proved to be his final year alive. ''All of this takes money, and lots of it,'' Maisel told Carole Fiedler. ''I know that a lot of people think that what you do is macabre . . . but I can tell you that you are in reality a dream weaver and a lifesaver.''
Fred, a retired engineer in Texas, agreed to explain the buyer side -- that of settlement providers who invest in the future deaths of policyholders -- on the condition that his full name not be used. A decade ago, Fred worked as a sales representative for a company called Vespers, which arranged viatical settlements for terminally ill policyholders. The company then sold shares to investors who would be paid when those policyholders died. Fred himself invested $200,000 in 10 different policies. The way it was supposed to work was that he would pony up a share of the settlement award, typically less than 10 percent, and would receive that same percentage, minus the premiums paid, of the death benefit once the insured person died.
Life-settlement investors, like those in other sectors, crave timely information about their holdings, and the key metric for predicting portfolio performance is the health status of the policyholders. To acquire this sensitive information, Fred says a Vespers representative would call and question the policyholders -- or their adult children, nurses and doctors -- as often as quarterly. He would then receive tracking reports summarizing what the company learned.
In the report for the third quarter of 2007, for example, Fred got updates for more than 100 policyholders, each of whom is identified by name. He could look up one man and learn that ''his health is fine.'' He could find out that the last time another policyholder was seen by a doctor ''her condition [was] poor due to the spread of her breast cancer.'' The briefest entries in the tracking report heralded investments that paid off: a name, followed by a notation like ''03/31/2006 -- Date Deceased.'' To date, Fred has been paid for seven such maturities. But his portfolio isn't entirely closed out. ''I still have three policies left,'' he told me. ''I'm waiting on them to die!''
This sort of profit-motivated death watch disturbs people like John Cautillo, an executive for a food-service company in New York. In June 2011, Cautillo helped his fiancée's mother sell her life-insurance policy. Quantum Life Settlements brokered the deal, netting a settlement of more than $2 million, which the family used to pay off a loan taken out to pay for the insurance premiums. Cautillo says that he would ''absolutely'' recommend the transaction to others. Yet the process is unsettling. ''Someone owns my future mother-in-law's life now,'' he says.
Investors like Fred take umbrage at the suggestion that they're rooting for death. ''We pray for all of our people, that they would have a good life and be able to use this money'' from the settlement, he said. Besides, he knows what it feels like on the other side of the fence. He sold his own insurance policy a couple of years ago and is now on the receiving end of calls from a provider wanting to know the latest on his health. Fred laughs about this. ''I say: 'I'm still alive! I'm hanging in there!' ''
Patrick Satterthwaite tested positive for H.I.V. in 1986, and by 1994 he had full-blown AIDS. At the time he was working for the post office in Guerneville, Calif., and he recalls his doctors' giving him two years to live. ''I looked at my situation and thought, Well, do I really want to spend the last two years of my life selling Elvis stamps?'' Satterthwaite says. With the help of Fiedler, he got a settlement on one policy he owned and an accelerated death benefit on a second, netting him more than $250,000, which he used to buy cameras and jewelry and to travel the world.
Today the money is long gone, but Satterthwaite, to his own amazement, is not. He's 64 and in the past decade has competed in triathlons and bodybuilding contests. His survival, due largely to innovative drug therapies, is a medical triumph. It's also a thorn in the side of the investor who was expecting him to die more than a decade ago.
To mitigate the risk posed by death's fickle nature, major investors try to acquire large numbers of policies, or ''lives''; the more they own, the more the law of averages smooths out the Satterthwaites in the portfolio. ''Small securities dealers may only buy 10 to 30 policies, whereas a bank or a hedge fund may buy 100 to 400,'' says Jason Moos, whose company, Sandor Management, acts as a broker for investors. The Lifeline Program has completed more than 3,000 settlements.
Large portfolios also allow mortality to be packaged for sale in ways that, for better or worse, recall the byzantine ingenuity of the subprime era. Settlements can be pooled, sliced and recombined into a dizzying array of financial instruments, including ''death'' bonds, derivatives, notes and swaps.
An investment firm called Centurion showcases some of the industry's most creative ways of packaging mortality. Steady returns are more important to clients than periodically stratospheric ones, so buyers for Centurion's ''micro longevity'' fund -- a group of several hundred settlements -- analyzed life-expectancy projections and made policy purchases with an eye toward evenly spacing the deaths. The company diversified acquisitions by sex, smoker status and the projected likeliest cause of death, from heart disease to cancer. Pollyanna Wan, an investment adviser at Centurion, says that there might have been certain years when the fund needed ''more lives that are projected to mature.''
Diversity has traditionally been constrained because there are a limited number of insurance policies available on the settlement market. This problem led Centurion to focus on ''synthetic'' mortality funds, or swaps. For these, Centurion isn't restricted to policies that are actually for sale. Instead, the company essentially bets on when particular people, whose insurance policies remain owned by other entities, like large investment banks, are going to die. Centurion thus benefits from a Walmart-size selection of lives rather than the limited supply of the corner bodega. ''It's a little bit like going to a warehouse and saying, 'What do you have in stock?' '' Wan says.
The science of predicting death is imperfect and evolving. The doctors and actuaries who provide reports to the settlement companies start by reviewing the reams of medical records sent in for cases like that of Ruben Robles. They identify all health issues and add or subtract months to the projected life expectancy, or L.E. An L.E. report I saw for Fred, for instance, credited him for exercising ''more than expected for age,'' while the long list of demerits included his high blood pressure, past heart attack and family history of cancer. Hoping to advance the precision of medical underwriting, the L.E. provider 21st Services is currently reviewing the Medicare records of some 10 million Americans who have died in the past two decades, analyzing the death risks posed by 240 different medical conditions, singly and in combination. ''By the time the study has been completed, 21st Services will have by far the largest data pool on factors that affect mortality,'' says Vince Granieri of 21st Services.
An L.E. calculation of, say, 48 months, is no guarantee that the person in question will keel over exactly 48 months later. Instead, the ''median L.E.'' figure relied upon by settlement companies simply means that if there are 1,000 people with the same medical status as the person being analyzed, you'd expect half of them to be dead at the 48-month mark. Hoping to make this guesswork at least somewhat more precise -- and to reduce the chance of betting wrongly on a case like that of Robles -- researchers for the settlement industry have begun to parse socioeconomic factors as well as medical ones. For instance, rich people ''are not going to die as predicted, because they have the resources to stay healthy,'' Wan says. Other life-expectancy consulting firms analyze death trends based on the prevailing lifestyles of where people live, separating the mountain-climbing denizens of Boulder from the Big Mac-chomping residents of Bakersfield.
The most startling attempt to sharpen traditional underwriting comes from a company called Longevity Insight, which recently began offering its analytics to the settlement industry. The company was formed in consultation with Howard Friedman, a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside, whose breakthroughs in the science of longevity were set in motion two decades ago. At the time, Friedman suspected that personality traits strongly influenced how long people lived, but proving that was a problem: the necessary longitudinal studies would take decades and cost millions of dollars.
Then, by chance, Friedman realized that his data had already been collected for him. Back in 1921, a Stanford University psychologist, Lewis Terman, selected 1,528 kids for a study on what demographic and psychological factors enabled students to excel, in both their early years and later in life. The children were regularly assessed even as they grew into adults, got jobs and had families. After Terman's death in 1956, the project was taken up by other researchers, who continued tracking the participants all the way into the 21st century. That the study hadn't been designed to analyze longevity scarcely mattered to Friedman: here was a large group of people who had undergone standardized assessments from age 11 till death. Friedman and his colleagues exhaustively mined the Terman data for statistically valid correlations between the ''psychosocial'' profiles of the participants and how long they lived. ''Surprisingly, the long-lived among them did not find the secret to health in broccoli, medical tests, vitamins or jogging,'' Friedman wrote in his 2011 book ''The Longevity Project.'' ''Rather, they were individuals with certain constellations of habits and patterns of living.''
Friedman's findings buck much of the conventional wisdom on longevity. For instance, the cheerful study participants were less likely, on average, to live to a ripe old age than the more serious ones, in part because happy-go-lucky people are prone to ''illusory optimism,'' meaning they underestimate health risks and are less likely to follow medical advice. Highly sociable people, on average, did not live longer than less gregarious ones as is commonly believed, because they tended to drink, smoke and party more. Over all, Friedman found a longevity edge for the successful nerds of the world, the scientist types over lawyers and businesspeople. ''The findings clearly revealed that the best childhood personality predictor of longevity was conscientiousness -- the qualities of a prudent, persistent, well-organized person -- somewhat obsessive and not at all carefree,'' Friedman wrote.
Dustin Milner, the chief executive of Longevity Insight, and Friedman have developed a proprietary underwriting system, ''LITE,'' in which they will administer intensive psychological reviews of people trying to sell their life insurance. The results will be parsed along with traditional medical L.E. reports. Longevity Insight can then advise settlement purchasers whether the insured is likely to die before the median L.E., on time or, most worrisomely for a potential purchaser, late.
On a cold, clear morning in Los Angeles, Ruben Robles let me accompany him to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for an appointment with his oncologist, Dr. Jeremy Rudnick. ''How are you doing, how are you feeling?'' Rudnick asked brightly as he strode into the examination room.
''Good,'' Robles said.
''How's your movement?''
''Good,'' Robles said.
Rudnick turned to me. ''This is the way it goes every time,'' he said. ''He comes in and tells me he's fantastic.''
In truth, Robles could have been better. Covering the short distance from the parking garage to Rudnick's office took him 10 minutes in a halting gait. When Rudnick asked what he had planned for the weekend, Robles repeatedly said ''cine, cine,'' until Rudnick realized that he meant he was going to the movies. But Robles's movement and speech were slowly improving, the doctor said. Bottom line, Robles was bucking the life-expectancy reports that projected his death as early as 2008. He was still alive.
For all the advancements that aim to make life-expectancy science more precise, death remains one of the most uncertain certainties around. When you invest in an individual life settlement, you are placing a bet. And bets hinge upon probabilities that can't be controlled. For Robles, something has gone unexpectedly right in the years since his terrible diagnosis, and it is beyond the reach of both social and medical science to fully explain it. At Cedars-Sinai, Rudnick led us to another room and pulled up a series of M.R.I. images of Robles's brain. The earlier ones, from 2007 and 2008, showed the white mass of a glioblastoma spreading across his left frontal cortex. But in the images after the third operation, in 2009, the frightening white blob didn't return. Rudnick estimates that fewer than 5 percent of patients in Robles's condition do as well as he has.
''At some point, will the tumor flip a switch and start growing again?'' Rudnick asked. ''It probably will, but we don't know when. I've seen people with this kind of tumor who have been stable for 20 years. It defies all odds, but somebody has to defy the odds.''

HEADLINE: The $400,000 Résumé Booster

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is a co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
During the M.B.A. gold rush of the past three decades, the Yale School of Management accomplished the unthinkable. As the number of prospective business-school candidates shot up to more than 750,000 a year and tuition payments cleared $100,000, Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago and other schools hired star faculty members, built gleaming buildings, established themselves as global brands and brought in tens (and sometimes hundreds) of millions in profits to their universities each year. Meanwhile, Yale somehow lost money.Specifically, Yale ''lost $15 to $20 million over the last 15 years,'' says Edward Snyder, the new dean of the Yale School of Management. It remained small (400 students), maintained an unusually low student-to-faculty ratio of 8 to 1 (most top schools are closer to 20 to 1) and offered only limited versions of some of its industry's most lucrative products (like part-time and executive M.B.A.'s). Most significantly it developed a reputation as a bastion of socially minded do-gooders who were less focused on maximizing profit. According to Bloomberg Businessweek's latest rankings of the top M.B.A. programs, Yale placed 21st, right behind Michigan State. 
Snyder has become the top hired gun in the business of business schools. An academic economist by trade, he built his reputation through successful stints as a deputy dean at the University of Michigan and dean at the University of Virginia. Snyder then turned the University of Chicago business school into the top-rated program in the country. In 2008, he reeled in a $300 million donation from David Booth, a hedge-fund manager and alumnus. It was the school's largest gift ever and enough to change the name to Chicago Booth. Now he's hoping to pull off a similar turnaround at Yale. That will almost certainly require shedding its do-gooder reputation.
Successful business schools have become major businesses themselves, but as I spoke to Snyder, I realized that the ones that bring in the most money might be doing the least for the global economy. It wasn't always this way. In the early 1950s, my grandfather paid around $800 a year to attend Harvard Business School. The course work gave him some practical skills that helped him move up from assistant foreman to full foreman at the same machine-tool company. These days, though, the value of your M.B.A. is as much symbolic as practical. With increased global competition, the real money is in résumé polishing and status, not supply-chain management. Harvard Business School now costs about $120,000, which, after taking into account room and board and two years of lost wages, comes to around $400,000 in real cost. This year, more than 10,000 people applied for fewer than 900 slots.
Harvard and the other top schools can charge their students (or customers, really) a huge markup for the same reason that Nike or Apple can. This leaves the hundreds of lower-tier business schools competing as something of an undifferentiated mass. These commodity-level players, like the Ourso College of Business at Louisiana State University, are effectively stuck with the increasingly difficult task of trying to distinguish themselves.
It is important to remember, though, that the basic tools of business are commodities. There are countless courses, books and on-the-job programs that teach the proper rules of accounting, the best practices for developing strategy and the key components of a business plan. Harvard's basic accounting course might be a bit better than, say, the University of Wisconsin's, but is it so much better as to justify three times the price?
Placing a value on intangibles is inherently squishy, but the Bloomberg Businessweek rankings have tried to cut through the murkiness by ranking the top M.B.A. programs two ways. Its prestige-and-overall-quality ranking garners the expected results (Chicago, Harvard, Stanford, and so forth). But its best-value-for-money calculation, which ranks the schools based on a ratio of debt and earnings for recent graduates, finds that the costs of the top-flight schools eat away most of their value. Graduates of elite business schools, the survey found, make an average salary of $160,000 one year out of school. In 20 years, they averaged around $200,000 a year. That's a lot of money, but probably nowhere near what many were expecting. Graduates were also likely to be heavily in debt and trying to get by in expensive cities. On the other hand, graduates of Ourso at L.S.U., the poll's top-ranked value school, earned about $60,000 a year on average, but they were more likely to live in lower-cost regions and less likely to be in debt.
Snyder's growth plan for Yale is certainly not to offer the best value for money. He sees Yale as the one second-tier school with a real shot at making it to the top. But as I sat in Snyder's large office in an old mansion in New Haven, I felt the need to admit that I'm rooting against him (sort of). Commoditized business education might not be prestigious, but it could produce extraordinary economic change. Some of the less elite schools, like the University of California, Irvine, are already offering free online courses in business fundamentals. Distributed digital education is still in its infancy, but it's easy to imagine that all sorts of educational tools will eventually be offered online or, better, on the inexpensive mobile phones that are all over the developing world.
The most disruptive development in the business world right now is that billions of people in China, India, Latin America, Africa and elsewhere have joined the world's market economies. There are hundreds of millions of small farmers, shopkeepers and potential entrepreneurs for whom mass business-educational tools could be transformational in ways that make a handful of top schools seem utterly irrelevant. While reporting in Haiti once, I met Yvrose Jean Baptiste, a microentrepreneur who made a meager living by buying groceries on the Dominican border and taking them, by bus, to Port-au-Prince to sell for a few pennies of profit. After spending a few days with Baptiste, I found it obvious that she had a sharp business instinct. The idea of giving her -- and millions like her -- a basic business education seems much more economically important than helping a tiny group of ambitious overachievers pay a fortune for a degree that seems more about helping people get a job than preparing them to do it.
Snyder surprised me by saying that he agrees (sort of). Offering commoditized business-education technology can help the world's poor. But, he said, elite multinationals face unique problems that require elite training. He recently returned from China, where almost all of the nation's 73 Fortune 500 companies are in commodities businesses. Elite schools, he said, need to teach skills that can help China move beyond commodities and create global brands. ''Who is going to solve that?'' he asked. ''It takes pretty big insights and big execution. There's a role for the top business schools in solving problems like that.''
As I left Snyder's office and walked out into Yale's verdant campus, I remembered that he has his own global brand to worry about. Yale, unlike the commodity programs, can't offer all of its classes free and build its prestige. High-end and mass business education probably will continue to exist side by side, but the question is what their relationship will be. High-end restaurants were once an elitist pleasure, but they undoubtedly influenced the organic foods that we now buy everywhere, from supermarkets to fast-food chains and lunch trucks. In the food industry, unlike many luxury-goods businesses, the high- and low-end businesses have conspired to offer the best possible stuff to the masses. It would make a great business-school case study.
BEAT HARVARD
This being business school, Edward Snyder, the new dean of the Yale School of Management, has a five-step plan for how to turn any middling institution into a leader in the field.
1. Start by focusing on the sectors where the school has strong relationships and build from there. Or, as Snyder says, ''Give up the undifferentiated, multi-brass-ring strategy of best recruiters, best students, best facilities, blah, blah, blah.''
2. Embrace a mix of faculty, particularly those with real-world experience. ''You'll still want some strong, fast-ball-discipline types in areas like economics, finance and psychology to teach how markets work and function,'' Snyder says. ''But get fewer of them.''
3. Calculate the cost of things -- any things! ''Be very focused on and systematic about collecting data and sharing data with other schools around the country and the world,'' he says. ''Collect data on industries and on markets. It's really valuable for students to do that, and you'll make your school valuable for insight and information.'' Extra credit: ''It's good for branding.''
4. Offer a broader mix of programs, including part-time ones. ''That's more affordable in today's economy and where the market at business schools is going.''
5. Book your ticket to Gdansk! ''If you're going to be global, be selective and try to identify a less well served country like Vietnam or Poland instead of China. Pick places with young populations that don't already have a lot of business schools.''
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Forget Harvard; Yale is just trying to beat Michigan State.
2. Many top-tier business-school graduates make less money than they expected.
3. And it's U.C.-Irvine that may change the world, anyway.

HOPE IN THE WRECKAGEIn 1974 I served as a visiting professor of neurology in Shiraz, Iran, and saw a village health program there in action. I saw, for example, a 26-year-old woman, with 6 months' training, correctly diagnose and manage respiratory infections, trachoma, cervical disc disease, and listen as a resident reviewed her deliveries and other events of the week. All of those involved in Mississippi's program, from Dr. Aaron Shirley to Prof. Mohammad Shahbazi, deserve credit for recognizing how Iran's program can apply to people in their state. The fact that Atlantic City and Camden, N.J., have also successfully used similar approaches illustrates its potential applicability in many locations. DONALD SILBERBERG, M.D. Professor and chairman emeritus, Neurology Department, University of Pennsylvania Medical Center, Philadelphia 
Suzy Hansen's article about what Mississippi could learn from Iran about health care delivery made good sense. But by mentioning our system of community health centers (C.H.C.'s) only in passing, she overlooks an infrastructure that is already in place in the United States, one that is succeeding in accomplishing many of the goals of the Iranian ''health house'' system she touts. As Hansen points out, there are more than 8,000 C.H.C.'s operating in America, serving a patient population that looks much like that of Mississippi: disproportionately poor, uninsured, with many of the same chronic -- and thus expensive -- illnesses. And yet the C.H.C.'s' costs in treating this population are significantly lower than that of traditional settings, like doctors' offices and hospitals. One way the C.H.C.'s are increasingly achieving these savings are through health care homes, a comprehensive approach much like that of the Iranian health houses, absent the home visits, which Hansen convincingly argues are a key part of making this work. In other words, we don't need to start from scratch here. The C.H.C.'s are already most of the way toward the model described in the piece, and with more support, that could go further. Unfortunately, and despite the fact that such support was built into the Affordable Care Act, Congressional budget hawks and conservative governors are pushing the other way. JARED BERNSTEIN, Economist, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Washington
Why did the magazine feel the need to create shock (''You read that correctly -- Iran'') and drama (''broken and desperate place -- Iran'')? According to Unicef, Iran's adult literacy rate from 2005 to 2010 was 85 percent; the male and female literacy rate for 15- to 24-year-olds was 99 percent. Iran is not a nation of uneducated, sad people. It is a proud, (mostly) modern society that happens to be currently run, unfortunately, by an insane leader. CAROLYN YASHARI BECHER, Los Angeles
A HIGH HOLY WHODUNIT
On the same day that I read the article about the Aleppo Codex, I read about the worry in Israel about being bombed. It strikes me that the Aleppo Codex could be better off alongside the Elgin marbles in the British Museum, or in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. JAY M. PASACHOFF, Pasadena, Calif.
CAYMANS, HERE WE COME
As far as U.S. individuals are concerned, no one has yet demonstrated to me that there's some kind of pandemic of rich people opening offshore accounts. In England, where I come from, it's reasonably commonplace for individuals to have bank accounts in Jersey. And in Germany, likewise, lots of middle-class families keep money in Luxembourg or Lichtenstein. But in the U.S., by contrast, I see no day-to-day indication that offshore accounts are a remotely common tax-avoidance strategy.
Insofar as there is a problem, it seems to me, the problem is with tax collection and enforcement, rather than with the complexity of U.S. tax legislation. Yes, the U.S. tax code is ridiculously complex and riddled with loopholes that ought to be abolished. But I think it's actually pretty good when it comes to individuals' offshore assets.

HEADLINE: Here Comes The Sell

BYLINE: By JEFF HIMMELMAN

 BODY:
Most mornings, Danny Kennedy hops on a bike with orange saddlebags and rides half an hour from his home to Oakland's Jack London Square. He makes for quite a picture cruising down Telegraph Avenue, decked out as he often is in an orange helmet, orange jacket and orange leather Adidas shoes. When he arrives at his office, he often makes his rounds on an orange indoor bike. (He's not joking around with the orange thing.) Though Kennedy was once a young environmental activist documenting the horrors of the oil and mining industries, he's now a 41-year-old company man. 
The orange that he wears daily -- which extends even to the checks on his shirts, and which drives his wife crazy -- is the brand color for his rapidly growing residential solar company, Sungevity, whose revenues grew by a factor of eight in 2010 and doubled again in 2011, and whose employees have grown to 260 from 3 since the company's inception five years ago.Given that growth, it's somewhat surprising to learn that Kennedy and Sungevity aren't taken very seriously by their larger competitors. Kennedy's activist past and his willingness to wear his commitment to the solar industry quite literally on his sleeve are viewed by some as a liability in an industry desperate to demonstrate its seriousness. Thanks to increased Chinese production of photovoltaic panels, innovative financing techniques, investment from large institutional investors and a patchwork of semi-effective public-policy efforts, residential solar power has never been more affordable. But even with pricing that requires no initial capital outlay from consumers and guarantees lifetime savings -- and even occasional opportunities to make money, by selling power back to the grid -- Americans still aren't buying into solar in significant numbers.
Two factors have hurt the industry's growth. The first is abstract and well ingrained in the American psyche: the negative association of ''green'' technologies with inefficiency and idealistic, hippie-fueled impracticality. The second is concrete and recent: the sleek, vacant headquarters of Solyndra, the infamous federally subsidized solar-panel manufacturer that went bankrupt in 2011. The glassy campus sits just off the Nimitz Freeway, visible to commuters between San Francisco and Silicon Valley as they battle rush-hour traffic each morning, surreptitiously checking their phones.
Though the failure of Solyndra has dominated the political and social discourse around solar power, the reality of the industry -- as evidenced by the enormous investments that companies like Google and Bank of America are making in residential solar power -- is that it has rapidly become a smart, practical and profitable investment. Despite a lack of widespread acceptance, the market is growing and the competition is getting tight.
Where Kennedy will ultimately fit into all of this remains to be seen. He told me: ''We don't need missionaries anymore. We need mercenaries.'' As the industry grows, big investments don't necessarily flow toward the people with the deepest environmentalist roots. No matter how much orange Kennedy wears or how dedicated to corporate branding he appears to be, his bleeding heart still shows through. Missionary, mercenary: can he -- can anyone -- be both?
Of the residential solar-power companies with national aspirations, Sungevity is among the smallest in terms of market share. Sunrun, one of the market leaders, is led by Lynn Jurich and Edward Fenster, two Stanford Business School graduates who got into the business, as Jurich told me, in part because ''the numbers worked.'' SolarCity, another market leader, was founded by the brothers Lyndon and Peter Rive; Lyndon had previously founded Everdream, a software company that was eventually bought by Dell. The venture is also backed by Elon Musk, the Rives' cousin and more notably a founder of PayPal; Tesla, the electric-car manufacturer; and SpaceX, a private space-exploration company. In 2004, Lyndon Rive was in a car with Musk on the way to Burning Man in Black Rock Desert, Nev., when the idea of getting into the solar business first hit him. (SolarCity also has a commercial solar-power business and is planning an initial public offering later this year, which could value the company at $1.5 billion.) Another company, SunPower, which is also a solar-panel manufacturer, does a big business in the residential market in California, through its dealer network. Kennedy and Sungevity run, roughly, fourth in California -- which, because it's the biggest market, most of these companies view as a proxy for the rest of the nation. But because of Kennedy's background with Greenpeace, his big Australian personality (he was born in the United States but identifies as, and sounds like, an Australian) and some of his high-profile connections, he and Sungevity have received a fair amount of media attention. The actress Cate Blanchett was an early investor, and the actor Mark Ruffalo recently began leasing a system from the company, which he discussed in an appearance on ''The Colbert Report'' in March.
This clearly rankles Kennedy's competitors. John Ordona, the director of communications at Sungevity, interviewed with another large solar company before taking the job at Sungevity. ''They basically said that Danny was a tree-hugger and that Sungevity had no real business plan,'' he told me. When I visited Sunrun, I was shown a graph indicating the size of their lead in California. When I asked about Kennedy and Sungevity directly, I was told by a marketing person, through a tight smile, ''Their mind share is bigger than their market share.''
Compared with the relatively smooth and recent road that some of his competitors took to arrive at the business of residential solar-power installation, Kennedy's path has been unusual. He has been fighting against oil and coal for most of his adult life. He got his start as an environmental activist at age 12, when he fought, as part of a landmark victory for conservationists in Australia, against the construction of a dam in Tasmania. After attending college, he worked for Greenpeace in Papua New Guinea, where he observed the efforts of villages to resist exploitation by international oil companies. There, in 1993, he nearly died after contracting malaria while trying to document the environmental damage Chevron was causing in the region. He was saved only after villagers rowed him, delirious with fever, upriver in a dugout canoe to the secluded home of a young Japanese anthropologist who happened to have a rescue agreement with Chevron. She lighted a signal fire, releasing a plume of colored smoke, and within hours a small helicopter airlifted Kennedy to Chevron's base camp, where an American doctor administered the drugs that saved his life. Once he was on the mend, Kennedy left Chevron's base camp and went right back to his efforts to expose the actions of the company that had just rescued him. ''I stayed out in the field and continued to work,'' he says. ''Went back to the village and told them, 'Everything's cool, thank you very much for getting me out of there.' ''
Kennedy left Greenpeace in 1995 and the next year founded Project Underground, which could be more flexible than Greenpeace and was more narrowly focused on issues of social justice and human rights. A year later, he was detained for three days by Indonesian intelligence. He suspected that a courier reported him for trying to ship water samples abroad -- water samples that would demonstrate the environmental abuses at the enormous Grasberg gold mine in Irian Jaya. These were the days of Suharto's repressive regime, and Kennedy says intelligence officials deprived him of sleep and forced him to dictate his version of events over and over again. At one point, he said, they threw him into a jeep and drove him to an old prison complex, where they told him to get out and walk around, despite a tropical thunderstorm. As he got out of the car and felt the men's eyes on his back, he assessed his chances of running for the forest line and escaping somehow. He thought they might try to shoot him. Instead, they loaded him back into the car, took him back to the cell and asked for his statement again. ''Messing with my head,'' Kennedy says.
In 1999, as part of his work with Project Underground, Kennedy helped coordinate the visit of a young activist named Terry Freitas to Colombia, in an effort to prevent an Occidental Petroleum development there. On his way to the airport for his flight home, Freitas was kidnapped by FARC, the leftist guerrillas active in Colombia's hinterlands. ''We thought it was going to be a hostage deal,'' Kennedy says, so he spent a week trying to raise a ransom. But FARC wasn't after money; Freitas was shot in the back and killed, along with two other Americans. Kennedy said he suspected but had no proof that the oil business was somehow behind the murders, and he worried about continuing to risk his own life. His first daughter, Aiko, was conceived that very week. ''Her middle name is his middle name,'' he says of Freitas. ''He was a really amazing kid.'' Kennedy began the slow turn away from front-line activism that would eventually lead him to residential solar power. He had been aware of the potential of solar energy since the early '90s, when he noticed that one village in Papua New Guinea had a health clinic that was able to provide immunizations because it had a few solar panels up, enough to power a refrigerator to keep the vaccines cold. He returned to work for Greenpeace in 2000 and the next year led its effort to support a ballot initiative in San Francisco that empowered the city to issue $100 million in revenue bonds to finance renewable-energy projects.
Five years later, on his way from Australia to Amsterdam, Kennedy stopped to deliver a report on behalf of Greenpeace at the Solar Power International conference in San Jose, Calif. He was struck by a speech given by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who was then the governor, about his ambitions for solar power in the state. ''There are people pumping their fists and standing on chairs,'' Kennedy told me. ''By this point in my life, I've been to dozens of solar conferences in various countries. And here you have the can-do American entrepreneurial heartland -- this is the San Jose conference center, Silicon Valley, ingenuity and know-how and risk capital all combined -- going crazy. And it was just kind of like, 'This is awesome.' '' Soon after that, he spent a night with a friend, Alec Guettel, whom he met years earlier, in 1990, at meetings in London to address the issue of ozone depletion. (Guettel was a protester outside the event, dressed as a soon-to-be-extinct penguin; Kennedy, attending as a youth delegate from Australia, wandered outside and ended up getting a beer with the penguin.) Kennedy had been searching for a way to convert his activist beliefs into a business that could make money and benefit the planet. A year after Schwarzenegger's speech, he, Guettel and Andrew Birch, a former banker and executive at BP Solar, started Sungevity.
When I visited Sungevity's offices in January, Kennedy kept asking if I had been across the street yet. ''Have you taken him?'' he asked a colleague. ''When are we taking him?''
Eventually, Kennedy took me himself. We walked out of Sungevity's main offices and across the cobbled street to an abandoned Barnes & Noble. When he opened the doors, I understood why he wanted me to see it: there before me, in one great room under a vaulted ceiling, were row after row of headset-wearing Sungevity employees tapping away at banks of high-resolution computer screens. Sungevity's massive installation, interconnection and service teams -- what Kennedy calls ''project management,'' meaning everything that has to be done once the solar system has been ordered -- worked here. Though they have since moved into a different office space, as of January there were about a hundred people working in that abandoned bookstore, nearly as many as there were in all of Sungevity's vast headquarters across the street.
The operation demands this many people because the permits required to put a solar array on your roof vary from city to city, even within California. ''Some agencies want an AutoCAD drawing of the proposed installation as a digital file,'' Kennedy said, pointing at the various people at work at their monitors. ''Others want a single line electrical drawing as a piece of paper in a folder somewhere. And somebody's got to do all that.''
When I asked Lyndon Rive if SolarCity had a similar operation, he said: ''There's a lot of complexity with permitting and everything else. We're trying to hide the customer from that pain.'' Lynn Jurich at Sunrun told me that the work it takes to arrange permits for an installation adds $2,500 to the cost of each system. Looking out at the Sungevity work force in that former bookstore, it wasn't hard to believe. It was a living, moving picture of the inefficiencies created by fragmented policy -- but it was also a lot of jobs. I kept trying to move farther and farther back, just to get some sense of the scale. As we walked out, Kennedy said: ''This business is a baby growing up so fast, forget childhood. It's straight into adolescence and beyond.''
The innovation that has pushed Sungevity and the rest of the residential solar industry straight into adolescence over the past five years was financial, not technological. Solar technology, though it retains a kind of Jetsonian aura, is hardly new. In 1954, Bell Labs discovered that purified silicon, doped with arsenic and sliced into thin wafers by a high-powered diamond saw, was capable of converting sunlight into electricity. The Bell Solar Battery was conceived as a way to power telephones with a cheap renewable resource, but the people at Bell sensed that they were on to something bigger. ''The dream of ages has been brought closer,'' a print ad read at the time. ''If this energy could be put to use -- there would be enough to turn every wheel and light every lamp that mankind would ever need.''
They weren't exaggerating. Enough sunlight falls on the earth's surface every hour to meet the entire world's energy needs for one year. A plot of roughly 100 miles by 100 miles in the American Southwest, if covered with today's industry-standard 15-to-20-percent-efficient solar panels, could generate enough power for the entire United States. This is not the whole story, of course; the sun shines only during the day, and as yet we have no efficient way to distribute and store the power that such a plot would generate (so that the energy could be used at night, for example). But the potential of the sun as a power source is nearly unlimited.
When we burn coal, gas or oil, we are simply harnessing an archived version of that same energy from the sun, stored in plant and animal life, compacted and preserved under the earth's crust. As Kennedy puts it in his passionate but rational way: ''Think about it this way. We're killing people in foreign lands in order to extract 200-million-year-old sunlight. Then we burn it . . . in order to boil water to create steam to drive a turbine to generate electricity. We frack our own backyards and pollute our rivers, or we blow up our mountaintops just miles from our nation's capital for an hour of electricity, when we could just take what's falling free from the sky.''
That's a hard argument to refute. Since the 1950s, solar cells based on Bell's battery technology have powered craft as big as space stations, but they have yet to define our lives in the way that Bell Labs envisioned. Solar technology in particular has carried unfortunate political baggage for the last three decades. During the comparatively oil-rich 1980s, Ronald Reagan removed the solar water-heating system that Jimmy Carter had installed on the roof of the White House, a symbolic swipe at liberals. In 2011, Solyndra's disastrous bankruptcy played right into the hands of politicians and pundits, who have gleefully pegged it to an anti-solar and anti-renewable narrative: solar isn't reliable, we're not good at it, the Chinese are better at it anyway, and so drilling and fracking are the pragmatic, job-creating ways forward.
The reason that the residential solar industry has begun to buck this general trend is because, instead of appealing to our heartstrings, it has begun to appeal to our checkbooks. The innovation that made this possible -- selling solar services instead of solar panels -- was pioneered in the commercial market by Jigar Shah. Though Shah was trained as a mechanical engineer, his most important bit of engineering was financial: in 2003, he started a company called SunEdison, which offered something called a solar-power purchase agreement (P.P.A.) to commercial customers.
Instead of having to pay all of the money for a solar installation up front and then having to carry that payment as a debt on their balance sheets, which no publicly traded company wants to do, companies like Whole Foods and Staples contracted with SunEdison to have solar panels put up at no initial cost. SunEdison then charged the companies for the amount of energy that the panels produced at a fixed rate for a period of 20 years -- a rate that was less than what the companies were already paying the utilities, and that would ultimately save them even more money as energy prices inevitably rose over time. The bold stroke was that they were selling the power, not the hardware.
The revenue stream from the 20-year P.P.A. contracts allowed SunEdison to raise capital from outside investors like Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and MetLife. The banks pay for the solar systems and then reap the returns on their investment through tax credits and a negotiated share of the monthly P.P.A. payments. Everybody wins: Staples gets cheaper energy for no money down, SunEdison sells the systems to the banks at a profit and charges recurring maintenance fees and the banks have a reliable revenue stream that also offsets their tax burdens. Shah was so convinced of his model's efficacy that when companies came to SunEdison looking to buy solar equipment outright, he referred them to his competitors.
Though there are debates about who was the first to bring Shah's model into the residential marketplace, all that matters is that for the time being Shah's conceptual model prevails. (Though, in most jurisdictions, the national residential installers have moved toward offering straight leases -- a fixed payment every month -- instead of P.P.A.'s, which vary according to the amount produced.) Five years ago, third-party-owned systems accounted for none of the residential solar market. In the first quarter of 2012, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, 63 percent of new solar systems in California were third-party-owned, and in Colorado, that number was as high as 80 percent. The solar lease has been a key driver for the explosive growth in the residential solar market in California and, increasingly, across the country.
Lyndon Rive, the head of SolarCity, said: ''People don't buy gas stations. People don't buy utilities. Why are we having them buy solar equipment?'' The premise of the lease is simple. You go online to one of the installers and enter basic information about your location and your previous year's energy usage. The installer then uses satellite and aerial imagery to assess how viable your rooftop is for solar use -- too many trees are a problem, southward-facing roofs have the most exposure to sunlight over the course of the day -- and whether they can put enough of a system on your roof to make it worthwhile.
If they can, the basic value proposition is this: Say you have been paying your utility, on average, $100 a month. The solar company installs solar panels on your roof, maintains them, monitors them and repairs them for the life of the lease. The output will reduce your utility bill to roughly $20 a month, and you pay around $65 a month to lease the equipment (and the power the equipment produces, along with maintenance). You're now paying $85 a month total, 15 percent less than you were, the installer has a revenue stream that it can use for cash flow or sell off to an investor and everybody is playing his part in reducing the burning of fossil fuels.
''The most frequent question I get,'' Kennedy says, ''is: 'What's the sting? Where's the trap?' '' Lyndon Rive says he still goes to dinner parties, where people know all about SolarCity and what he does, and at the end of his pitch about the solar lease, somebody will say: ''So how much does this cost again? What's the payback period?''
'''You haven't heard me!''' he shouted to me, over the telephone, spelling out his frustration with those kinds of questions. ''You get cheaper electricity! Full stop!' ''
A lot of major players in the economy get it, and they are betting on the potential of renewables and on the power and profitability of the residential solar-lease arrangement. This includes Google, which has created two residential solar funds totaling $355 million. (The willingness of these large companies to invest in the residential solar market via leasing arrangements is one reason that the installers would much rather lease you a system than have you buy one, even though buying one is usually a better deal if you can afford it. The average price of a system has come down to $25,000 or so from $50,000 over the last five years, but Sunrun won't sell you a system even if you want it to, and SolarCity and Sungevity make clear from their pricing structures and maintenance options that, for now, they would rather offer you a lease.)
But all of this institutional money flowing into residential solar leases and the solar field in general does not fit the impression that the coverage of Solyndra has left in anybody's mind. ''The thing that bugs me the most about the way the press has covered all this stuff is that we can't physically grow any faster,'' Jigar Shah told me. He pointed to industry data that showed that over the last five years, revenue in the global solar-energy industry has increased to $93 billion in 2011 from $17 billion in 2007. ''No one knows that, right?'' he said. ''People are complaining to me that we don't have enough stuff on roofs. Right? I mean -- '' and here he concluded with various expletives.
''I'm kind of caught on the turning of the corner of the old to the new,'' Kennedy confessed at one point over dinner. The pivot from activist to entrepreneur, in his mind, has been a smooth one. Nonprofits and activists think they can change the world, and so do entrepreneurs.
In the industry's eyes, this isn't a race to see who wins by the third quarter of 2012. It's a transformation that, if it comes, will come over decades, as electric vehicles reinforce the need for cheaper electricity and solar panels become ever cheaper and more widespread. Already the residential solar market has begun to deploy building-integrated solar, with roofing shingles that double as solar panels. This will eventually extend to your windows and other surfaces, and it will become easier and cheaper until -- if you believe in the vision of the solar promoters -- your contractor and your local roofing company will install solar as standard equipment.
Silicon Valley has done a great job of talking about its disruptive potential, but there is something truly disruptive about solar: a fully distributed model of energy generation. We currently rely on the centralized hub-and-spoke delivery systems of the utilities, many of which are outdated and suffer tremendous losses as electricity travels from power plants, along transmission and delivery lines and into our businesses and homes. There is a massive infrastructure of regulation and enforcement in the energy market to underwrite the utilities; it's one of the most highly regulated and noncompetitive markets in the country. Imagine a world in which homeowners and business owners are miniature power plants, with the full ability to sell power back to the grid at retail prices -- power, literal and figurative, would be wrested from the hands of monopolistic, polluting utilities and their ancillary industries: mining, fracking and the like.
The advantages of such a system are obvious. Not only would Americans pay less for energy, but with solar they would also provide power back to the grid at peak hours, when utilities are the most taxed -- and when they turn to their most expensive and dirtiest ''peak'' power plants, which are standing by for just such occasions. We would also avoid some blackouts, because fewer houses would be reliant on the grid, and transmission failures wouldn't cascade in the same way. By some estimates, 500 megawatts of rooftop solar -- roughly the total amount of solar that California installed just last year, equivalent to about 80,000 residential systems -- would have prevented the blackout of 2003 and saved the U.S. economy several billion dollars.
The utilities are too stuck in their ways to do this themselves. An effort by Duke Energy in North Carolina to experiment with distributed generation and residential solar ended with only seven actual residential installations, after finding the process cost-prohibitive. An employee of a major utility in California told me that solar is ''kind of a pain.'' The employee said the core competency of the utility was ''acquiring lots of power and gas, building a plant and distributing it.'' He added: ''If you want to aggregate thousands of people and [install] solar, it's a low-margin business. Go ahead.''
Everybody I spoke with in the solar industry stressed the need for all companies to act in ways that benefited the industry as a whole, in the belief that there is room for them all to succeed as long as they keep their standards high. ''Most of the world gets that climate change is real,'' Kennedy said. ''The weather is changing, wacky stuff is happening, and we need something other than fossil-fuel dependency.''
And so they are all, really, still missionaries. They talk about market share, but their main task is a common one: persuading people to change the way they think about energy, and to believe that the more we can do for ourselves, the better. The solar companies can make all the financial and clean-energy arguments they want to, but they still have to impel average consumers to switch energy providers for their own homes.
Which brings us back to the orange that Danny Kennedy wears as a uniform most days. ''I'm sure there are people who look at you and say, 'Gimme a break,' '' I said to him, as we were finishing dinner on my last night in California.
He laughed. ''Yeah, there probably are,'' he said. ''I haven't really thought about it, but yes.'' A moment later, he added: ''Humanity needs to be reminded that the sun's putting out four hundred trillion trillion watts every second of every day, and we should tap that. Let's wear it, be proud of it, push it. That's the real motivation, I think. We've got to brand the sun.''
He and his team at Sungevity might not have all the answers or the most scalable model, but who knows? And why not try? Why not compare yourself to Steve Jobs without irony? And why not celebrate the fact that you were trying to do something good for the planet at the same time?
''We need to build a sense of identity that roots people in the future, which is inevitable. It seems impossible today that it could be there, but it will be, and this'' -- he pulled at his orange shirt -- ''this helps, maybe. Even if it's just for the staff, and I think a lot of it is, it's like: 'Carry on. This is a struggle.'
''I'm sorry, I'm raving now,'' he went on, leaning forward, ''but will we make it? Will other companies make it? Very good questions. Yet that the overall march of this will get to its destination? That will happen.''

HEADLINE: An Architect's Vision: Bare Elegance in China

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
Hangzhou, ChinaWANG SHU, the first Chinese architect to win the Pritzker prize, arrives at his studio here most mornings and sits at a desk with sheets of soft brown paper, a cup for mixing black ink with water, and a brush. He reads seventh-century poetry and then begins to write calligraphy, quick short strokes up and down the page. The ritual, he says, infuses calm into the day ahead.
The ancient art is not the only thing that sets Mr. Wang and his work apart from the glitzy marble-and-glass commercial architecture that has dominated China's urban boom. His bold yet refined buildings that often recall nature fuse old-world Chinese and modern idioms, using inexpensive materials, like recycled bricks and tiles, as building material. His studio, called the Amateur Architecture Studio, does not have a Mac. A few dusty terminals, from the 1990s, surrounded by piles of old newspapers, are scattered across the tabletops. His six assistants, students at the nearby academy of art in this still, pretty lakeside city, show up as needed. This particular afternoon Mr. Wang, and his wife and fellow architect, Lu Wenyu, unlocked the front door -- a big slab of wood -- to find no one around. 
In awarding this year's Pritzker Prize to Mr. Wang, 48, in February, the jury catapulted to center stage an architect who profoundly disagrees with China's rush to urbanization and has found a way to criticize it through his own style of work. Mr. Wang, who grew up in China's far western reaches in Xinjiang province, is an outlier in his profession here. He has designed only one apartment building, a series of 14-story blocks with deep verandas, in Hangzhou. His museums, academies, homes, and a garden of ancient tiles are all touched by old China. Yet China's vice prime minister, Li Keqiang, a master of the economy that has produced the cities Mr. Wang abhors, embraced him at the Pritzker award ceremony in the Great Hall of the People in May. Images of the pair -- the man who will most likely become prime minister in the coming leadership changes, and the architect, dressed in black -- were splashed across China's news media.
It is the rush to emulate the West and the insistence on trashing what makes China so distinctive that upsets Mr. Wang. Why should China become something it's not, he asks. ''We want to copy Manhattan,'' he said over lunch near his studio. ''I love Manhattan. It's a very interesting place. But if you want to copy something that was accomplished in 200 years, it's very difficult. New York was not designed by architects, it was designed by time.''
Part of his criticism is driven by a recognition that a nexus of government officials and crony investors have made enormous amounts of money clearing land of old dwellings and broken roads to build highways, airports, rail stations and housing. ''Sixty percent of government income comes not from normal tax but from the sale of land,'' he said. Some reports put the percentage of take from land sales even higher. Phoenix New Media, a company in Hong Kong that is sympathetic to the Chinese government, recently quoted a report from the Ministry of Land and Resources that said that 74.1 percent of government revenues in 2010 came from land sales, up from virtually zero in 1989.
Mr. Wang is sympathetic to poor farmers who yearn for cities with air-conditioning and supermarkets. But if given the chance to renew villages in a sustainable way, rural people would be better off, he argues. One of his latest projects involves persuading a Communist Party secretary in a village near Hangzhou not to tear down the dwellings but to renovate using the original tiles and bricks. ''People see black-and-white choices,'' he said. ''But in fact we have much potential, and can do very simple things and have a modern, comfortable life.''
Two architects who know Mr. Wang's work emphasize his ability to combine the old and the new, Chinese and Western. ''It's possible to see Wang Shu's work as a new vernacular,'' said Mohsen Mostafavi, the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Design. ''He's actually deeply rooted in modernism. His work is not something that is just a replica of Chinese architecture or just a replica of Western architecture. It's a fusion of different sensibilities.''
Zhang Yonghe, a prominent Chinese architect who headed the school of architecture and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, described Mr. Wang as enabling ''us to see the vitality of the traditional in contemporary culture, that modernization is not the same as Westernization.'' He praised Mr. Wang for having unusual integrity: ''In today's China it's not easy to resist market pressures and maintain independent values as Wang Shu has done.''
His work includes an eclectic mix of museums, universities and living spaces. In its citation the Pritzker jury singled out the History Museum of Ningbo, in a port city near Shanghai, for ''its strength, pragmatism and emotions all in one.'' The museum looks bulky from a distance; up close the recycled ceramic tiles and vintage bricks in hues of gray, orange and blue lend a feeling of earthiness. The China Academy of Art at Xiangshan in Hangzhou, a half-dozen buildings, is dominated by white walls reminiscent of traditional Chinese homes depicted in old watercolor paintings. A work from 2000, the library of Wenzheng College at Suzhou University in Suzhou, consists of a white cube jutting into a lake with front walls of glass.
Even with the prominence that his Pritzker prize has conferred, Mr. Wang is not venturing abroad. His post-Pritzker projects include a rammed-earth building that will serve as a hotel for professors visiting the campus of the art academy.
Wherever possible he uses recyclable materials, an art he refined in the 1990s when he put aside formal architecture to work with craftsmen and builders as they converted old houses into art galleries, music halls, even hair salons. By 2000 he was appointed professor of architecture at the art academy in Hangzhou and was back in big-league architecture, entering competitions and accepting commissions.
His vision matured at a time when provincial governments and college campuses, flush with new cash, commissioned museums and additional buildings, like libraries, that intrigued Mr. Wang. In emphasizing the value of what is distinctively Chinese, he is not one of the new breed of nationalists. He and Ms. Lu enjoy taking their 11-year-old son on overseas trips, and for the last few years they jointly taught a course at Harvard's Graduate School of Design on traditional Chinese villages as a basis for creating what they called ''rustic-style'' new suburbs.
They are an inseparable couple, with an around-the-clock working partnership that seems easy, sometimes jokey and truly collaborative, so much so that the Pritzker jury contemplated giving the award jointly. They met in architecture class at the Nanjing Institute of Technology, when he eyed the ''girl in the green sweater,'' he said, who also, it turned out, came from Xinjiang. ''In terms of our work, I'm more responsible for the design while Lu Wenyu is more responsible for the implementation,'' he said. Mr. Wang is the serious personality, almost professorial in demeanor. Ms. Lu is more outgoing. When they met, she said, she laid down a condition: She would be his girlfriend but would not attend the after-class seminars he conducted for eager students in the university dormitory.
The new campus of the China Academy of Art at Xiangshan was one of the works that most impressed the Pritzker jurors when they visited China last fall. Mr. Wang often drives to the campus with Ms. Lu. More accurately, she drives. He does not have a license and sits in the passenger seat of their modest station wagon. No Porsche, the preferred vehicle of some Chinese architects, for Mr. Wang.
As the jury toured the site, Thomas J. Pritzker, the scion of the Hyatt hotel fortune that finances the Pritzker prize, asked Mr. Wang the cost of building the campus, he recalled. ''I said the first phase was 1,500 yuan per square meter, and the second phase was 2,500 yuan per square meter,'' Mr. Wang said he replied. Even before hearing the translation into dollars of about $235 and $392 per square meter, Mr. Pritzker intuitively understood. ''It cost nothing,'' Mr. Pritzker told his colleagues. In contrast, a prestige office building in Beijing costs $952 a square meter, according to Langdon & Seah, a project management consultancy, in Hong Kong.
The campus was a dream assignment, Mr. Wang said. The bid called for an international caliber building for 5,000 students on a low budget to be built on abandoned rice fields. The art academy's president, Xu Jiang, an artist, was Mr. Wang's friend, and, in this case, his client. The first decision: to keep as much of the natural environment as possible. The buildings were erected on the edge of the fields, leaving open space all around. Second: no marble clad on concrete pillars in the wasteful style of the art academy in downtown Hangzhou. The campus is distinctive, Mr. Mostafavi said, because unlike most university campuses it is not subsumed by a master plan. ''Here are buildings that come together as a series of fragments that produce a sense of unity,'' he said.
As he showed the academy, Mr. Wang acknowledged that the finishes were not perfect. Along the internal walkways, jagged holes were punched through the exterior walls, to bring the outside in. Reddish wood from local yew trees was used for walls and doors. ''It's very cheap and grows very fast,'' he said. In 20 years the wood will need to be replaced. Bamboo railings will have to be renewed in five to seven years. ''It's sustainable,'' he said, ''all very easy to replace.''
That such an unconventional architect should win the Pritzker in a country that has embraced foreign architects -- including the past Pritzker winners Norman Foster and Zaha Hadid -- for the design of buildings in China's big cities astounded the powerful construction interests. Mr. Wang calls them the ''normal group,'' professionals who greeted his award with public silence.
In his acceptance speech at the award ceremony, Mr. Wang confronted the establishment with questions, a rare and brave act. Would it be possible, he asked, to ensure that alongside ''the top-down professional system of modern architecture, ordinary people's right to initiate their own building activities is also protected?'' Did China really need to ''resort to gigantic symbolic and iconic structures?'' Were there ''smarter ways to address environmental and ecological challenges?'' Such difference of opinion before top government officials was striking, said Hong Huang, a columnist for the liberal newsmagazine Nandu Weekly. ''It's voices like that that will start to change China,'' she said.
Behind the scenes, among the young Chinese architects who are developing an alternative architectural style inspired by Mr. Wang's work, he detects chatter. ''Young architects are very happy,'' he said. ''They can see some hope.''

HEADLINE: For Bike Advocates, Delayed Gratification

BYLINE: By J. DAVID GOODMAN

 BODY:
IT was supposed to be the summer of bike share.And for Transportation Alternatives, the bicycle and pedestrian advocacy group, it was supposed to be a time to celebrate. A fund-raising party in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn -- complete with a choreographed ''Bike Ballet'' -- was set for Aug. 23, a date chosen early this summer and meant to occur long after the bikes had rolled out.
The party will go on. But, with Labor Day looming, the city's bike-share program, to be the largest in the country and once promised for July, has not yet hit the streets.
On Friday morning, thousands of bikes for the program, sponsored by Citigroup and known as Citi Bike, sat in boxes in Building 293 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. 
''We're still taking deliveries,'' said a worker, who declined to be identified, rolling through the cavernous space on one of the few royal blue Citi Bikes so far assembled. Gray pieces for some of the hundreds of expected docking stations were stacked nearby. No activity could be seen at a few bike mechanic stands in one corner of the warehouse.
There is no official date for the rollout, and supporters fear the warm-weather window to begin the program this year is shrinking.
''We're preparing for that eventuality,'' Paul Steely White, the executive director of Transportation Alternatives, said in a phone interview last week, referring to a significant delay in the program. ''That would be unfortunate but not disastrous. New York is ready for bike share.''
Delays would push the kickoff further into a mayoral race in which transportation is likely to be a major issue -- in part because of policies that Transportation Alternatives has pushed. Any stumbles could call into question the wisdom not only of bike share itself, but of its underlying premise: that bicycles are a key part of the city's transit system, an argument the group has made since the 1970s.
At the same time, the arrival of bike share -- whenever it occurs -- raises a sort of existential question for the once-fringe group. With a staff of 23 full-time employees, roughly 8,000 dues-paying members and an active e-mail network of more than 40,000, not to mention a deep bench of alumni working in government, the group has become a potent political force.
But when the City of New York has made your agenda its official policy -- including pedestrian plazas and a vast bike-lane network -- how alternative can you continue to be?
Very, Mr. White said. ''We see this as the beginning rather than a culmination,'' he said in a May interview. ''Now we have a mainstream audience.''
FORTY years ago, the ragtag collection of environmental advocates and bicycle riders, dissident city planners and urban preservationists who would coalesce into Transportation Alternatives sat decidedly outside the mainstream.
''Ban autos from Manhattan!'' urged a psychedelic poster for a demonstration at the General Motors building in 1968. Four years later, another poster demanded ''free bicycles'' and ''millions for public transit.''
The group made its public debut in a traffic-snarling protest ride down Fifth Avenue in 1973. Momentum grew when Edward I. Koch, then a congressman, joined the next big ride a year later.
The oil crisis created a surge of interest in alternative transit during the 1970s, and the pro-bike atmosphere helped land David Gurin, an urban planner who designed the posters and helped found the group, an appointment as deputy transportation commissioner in the Koch administration. While there, he brought short-lived separated bike lanes to a few Manhattan avenues.
But biking for transportation took a nose dive as New York's economy rebounded.
''In '87, things were really at a low ebb,'' said Charlie Komanoff, a transit analyst and economist who ran the group at the time. ''The plucky bike commuter had been replaced by the mergers-and-acquisitions specialist partying in the back of an idling limo.''
In the late 1980s, the city even moved to ban bicycles from Midtown Manhattan. A large street sign from that effort -- a bicycle with a slash through it -- still hangs in the 10th-floor Chelsea offices of Transportation Alternatives as a reminder of bad times.
The group slowly built support and membership while staging protests, blocking traffic and painting the roadway with body outlines where pedestrians had been killed by cars. At the same time, it was making inroads with city government and growing its full-time staff thanks to a change in federal law in 1991 that resulted in some big grants. But it remained small until the past decade, when interest in cycling again took off nationally and an infusion of cash from Mark Gorton, a hedge-fund manager and the group's largest single donor, helped it expand.
The major turning point came in 2007, when Janette Sadik-Khan took the reins of the Transportation Department. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg gave Ms. Sadik-Khan a mandate to remake the city's streets, and, as part of an aggressively pro-bike agenda, she brought in a number of people from the group.
One of those hired was Jon Orcutt, who once ran Transportation Alternatives. In 1990, he was arrested and charged with blocking the Queensboro Bridge during a protest, though he was acquitted at trial. Today, he is the Transportation Department's policy director. Critics quipped that the inmates had taken over the asylum.
Changes came quickly: hundreds of new miles of bike lanes appeared around the city; pedestrian plazas were built; parking spots were eliminated; and streets were narrowed to slow traffic. When these initiatives sparked a backlash, the city called upon Transportation Alternatives to rally supporters to beat it back, Mr. White said.
Some New Yorkers continue to bristle at this close relationship. ''T. A. has contributed to the demonization of cars,'' said Louise Hainline, a resident of Park Slope, Brooklyn, whose group, Neighbors for Better Bike Lanes, publicly tangled with Transportation Alternatives and the city over the 2010 installation of a bike lane on Prospect Park West. ''They've been very effective, but I don't think our city is better for it.''
LOOKING back at the utopian signs he created four decades ago, Mr. Gurin, now a city planning consultant, marveled at how much the times had changed. ''In a certain sense, all of this has come about,'' he said.
He pointed to the bicycle-share program (free bikes, after a fashion), better financing of subways and buses since the 1990s (billions for transit, in fact) and even the failed congestion-pricing plan advocated by the Bloomberg administration (not quite a ban on cars).
Not that the battle has been won. ''I actually think they've done about 2 percent of what needs to be done,'' said Mr. Gorton, who has given Transportation Alternatives roughly $10 million over the past decade.
He knows a few things about radically disrupting powerful established orders. His peer-to-peer file-sharing system, LimeWire, picked up where Napster left off in challenging the recording industry's business model -- before it in turn was shut down by a federal judge. And his current venture, a financial firm specializing in computer-driven high-speed trading, is part of a movement threatening the status quo on Wall Street. (He also acknowledges having an obsession with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, calling it a ''massive, massive conspiracy'' perpetrated by the Central Intelligence Agency.)
''I'm certainly comfortable taking positions that are the opposite of the vast majority of people,'' he said. With transit philanthropy, he takes the long view. ''You're talking about changing the role of the automobile in our society,'' he said. ''It's a big, long, slow push.''
The group is currently pushing the New York Police Department to conduct more in-depth investigations of car accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists, part of a larger effort to slow traffic and bring the hammer down on speeding or negligent drivers -- all with the goal of reducing traffic fatalities to zero. It's also talking about next-generation bike improvements, like a wider path across the Brooklyn Bridge, endorsed last week by several City Council members, and looking to slow traffic in more neighborhoods in boroughs outside Manhattan.
The group has also been active in trying to curb dangerous cycling, passing out pamphlets that urge lawful riding in an effort to defuse tensions between pedestrians and cyclists.
But Transportation Alternatives is also preparing to play defense, Mr. White said. The current mayoral candidates have not made explicit promises regarding the Bloomberg bike legacy, but Mr. White, who said he had ''good access'' to the candidates, is bracing for an administration less friendly to alternative transit. ''I would characterize their positions as fluid,'' he said.
If the bike-share program is embraced by New Yorkers, it would be the most visible and enduring symbol of Mr. Bloomberg's policies. But if it runs into trouble, it could make any new administration skittish about bringing similarly sweeping changes to city streets.
''That's what keeps me up at night,'' Mr. White said. ''That what has happened over the last four years was just an aberration.''

HEADLINE: A Dot-Com Bust

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER; Colin Moynihan and Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
OF the five members of a purported crime ring who appeared in court last month, Jennifer Sultan could not help but stand out. She seemed to have little in common with those said to be her accomplices: among them, a police officer charged with stealing his colleagues' guns to support a painkiller habit and two unemployed young men from Brooklyn and Queens charged with selling guns and drugs.The prosecutor, who opposed bail for most of the defendants, pointed out to the judge in State Supreme Court in Manhattan why each one might be a risk for flight. When it came to Ms. Sultan, 38, every head in the courtroom swiveled at the main point: she had once been a dot-com millionaire.
The finer details were not mentioned that day: at the high-water mark, she and her boyfriend were co-founders of a small Internet company that sold for $70 million. They rented a summer house in the Hamptons for $400,000. They bought a 6,000-square-foot loft on East 17th Street just off Fifth Avenue. 
Now, a little more than a decade later, Ms. Sultan is bankrupt and sitting in a jail cell, unable to pull together $85,000 for bail. If convicted, she faces 15 years to life in prison on charges of selling prescription painkillers to an undercover police officer and of trying to sell a .357 Magnum to the man accused of being the ringleader.
Her life has in some ways followed the arc of her times, with even more extreme swings.
She rode the euphoria of the late-1990s technology stock boom to apparent riches at age 25, saw those fortunes collapse with the stock market in the early 2000s and was unable to stage a comeback in the more sober recession era.
To some who have known Ms. Sultan, her overwhelming ambition and dalliances with wilder crowds as a young adult in Manhattan made her fall less surprising. But to others, including her close family, the collapse has been bewildering.
''We are treading on water that we have never treaded on before,'' said her mother, Brenda Sultan. ''She is such a sweet, thoughtful person.''
She grew up as the middle child between two brothers in West Long Branch, N.J., five miles north of Asbury Park. Her father, David Sultan, owned a dry-cleaning business. Her mother had grown up in Brooklyn and dreamed of an idyllic suburban life for her children. They lived that life in a modest colonial-style house at the end of a quiet cul-de-sac.
Her mother recalls the terror of watching Jennifer, at just 2 years old, perched at the end of a diving board over the deep end of a swimming pool.
''Everybody, look at me!'' she shouted as she leapt.
That physical confidence evolved into athletic prowess when she was a student at Shore Regional High School. Jennifer excelled in five sports: soccer, field hockey, softball, swimming and diving.
''She was tough,'' Mrs. Sultan recalled. ''She is, in fact, a girlie girl, but she's also very athletic.''
Young Jennifer filled stacks of journals with her thoughts and dreamed of writing children's books. In her senior year of high school, she smiled confidently in her yearbook above a long passage she had written.
''Like a small child I climb up the stairway of life. Have I come to the end or have I only just begun?'' the text began. ''My collected visions have enabled me to keep dreaming. I must go now, my life awaits.''
FOR Ms. Sultan, the city that her mother had left behind held great allure. She was accepted to New York University, her first choice, where she studied literature.
''She just fell in love with the city, and N.Y.U. was a fabulous opportunity for her,'' her mother said. ''She did extremely well. She blossomed in college.''
She became interested in photography and while still in college parlayed that into freelance work taking pictures of rock stars, including David Bowie and the members of Aerosmith, in posed settings and during concerts, according to her mother and a business associate.
Ms. Sultan rented a duplex apartment on East 13th Street near Fifth Avenue, and to help with expenses, she sublet the downstairs unit. She found the tenant, Adam Cohen, through mutual friends. They became business partners and were eventually engaged.
Several people who knew Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan professionally said they could seem like an unlikely pair. They are close in age but different in disposition. Whereas he bordered on reclusive, she basked in the club life of Lower Manhattan and was regularly out all night.
''Jen was always going out,'' said one associate from the 1990s, who like several others would speak only anonymously because of the seriousness of the crimes Ms. Sultan was charged with. ''She knew people from all these different scenes. Adam wasn't into any of that.''
Mr. Cohen was working for a company called Styleworks Interactive that put together designer-fashion shows at the Hotel InterContinental, the former associate said. Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan, who graduated from N.Y.U. in 1996, have said they came up with the idea to stream the fashion shows on the Internet, then a new concept. Ms. Sultan also mentioned to work associates a desire to live-stream the music events she photographed.
The owner of the company, Debra LaChance, spun off Styleworks, later renamed Live Online. The company, with fewer than two dozen employees, including Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan, quickly gained a foothold in the new world of live streaming, handling events for MTV, Arista Records and other entertainment companies.
In January 2000, two months before the dot-com bubble reached its high point, Digital Island, a company that had gone public the year before, bought Live Online in a deal valued at $70 million.
It was an occasion for celebration and fleeting excess.
That summer, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan rented an 11-bedroom house in the Hamptons for $400,000, The New York Observer reported at the time.
''There are people who just don't know what to do'' with their money, the real estate agent who rented the property told The Observer.
A few months later, the couple bought the loft on East 17th Street for $3.1 million. It was one of six floor-through apartments in an eight-story building.
Mrs. Sultan recalls that there was ''a lot of excitement'' after the sale of Live Online.
''But it was not long lived,'' she said.
THOUGH it was valued at $70 million, the Live Online deal involved only $5.25 million in cash. The rest of the price was paid in Digital Island stock, nearly 800,000 shares, valued at about $81 a share.
The Live Online crew never saw that much money. Technology stocks peaked in March 2000. By the time their shares were offered for sale, the value had been cut by more than half. A year after that, Digital Island was bought by Cable and Wireless, a British telecom company, for $3.40 a share, so stock that had once been worth $65.9 million was worth just $2.7 million.
And Ms. Sultan's share of the deal was relatively small. She received 5 percent of those Digital Island shares, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Cohen received 37 percent. Ms. LaChance, who declined to comment for this article, and her brother-in-law, Victor Starsia, a lawyer, received 48 percent of the shares. People with knowledge of the deal said Ms. LaChance, who had put up the money to found Live Online, received most of the cash from the sale.
Charles Picasso, who was the chief operating officer for Digital Island, said Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan were involved with the new company for a few months after the merger. But they were phased out, Mr. Picasso said, as Digital Island took more control.
In 2002, they started another business of their own, Global Media Services.
''We are the inventors of all things streaming!!!'' Ms. Sultan says of the company on her personal Facebook page.
In 2003, Global Media was taken over by Newsplayer Group, a British company that had the journalist and comedian David Frost on its board and marketed videos of his interviews. The merger does not appear to have gone well. In 2005, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan bought the company back for $100 and a promise to pay 15 percent in royalties to the British company, by then called Catalyst Media Group, according to court records.
Their personal finances were already strained. They had stopped paying property taxes on their loft, according to court records, and had taken out a total of $4 million in mortgages on the loft that required $27,000 in monthly payments.
Ms. Sultan began pursuing a new interest: acupuncture and holistic medicine. She took classes at the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine a few blocks north of the loft, while remaining involved in Global Media with Mr. Cohen.
''Always a pioneer, Sultan plans to integrate her knowledge of technology with the holistic medical field to help bring alternative and complementary healing to the forefront of Western culture,'' her biography on the Global Media Services Web site said at the time, according to an archive of Web pages at archive.org.
Her mother saw the change as part of a progression.
''She's a natural healer; all she wanted to do was help people,'' Mrs. Sultan said. ''She was no longer interested in technology, but it was still her bread and butter.''
But Ms. Sultan and Mr. Cohen's actions, as described by former associates and court records, appeared to grow increasingly erratic. Ms. Sultan's lawyer in the criminal case, Frank Rothman, said she had developed an addiction to pain medication prescribed to treat back pain from the sports she played as a child and a fall she took in her apartment.
In April 2009, Global Media merged again, this time with GridNetworks, a Seattle-based company founded to deliver content over the Internet. In an odd coincidence, GridNetworks' investors brought in Mr. Picasso, the former chief operating officer of Digital Island, to head the new company.
''On behalf of the whole team, I wanted to express how excited I am to be working closely with you again!'' Mr. Cohen wrote in an e-mail to Mr. Picasso in May 2009. ''I am looking forward to making Global Media Services a big success.''
But the deal quickly collapsed. The staff of 11 in Seattle sued six months later, saying the employees had not been paid before being laid off in July. In court papers, Mr. Picasso accused Mr. Cohen of draining $700,000 from the company on the day of the merger. Mr. Picasso dropped his lawsuit and the accusation was not resolved.
Mr. Picasso said he quit in July 2009, on the day he learned that a contract with MTV that Mr. Cohen had said should still be generating revenue had actually been canceled months earlier. Now retired in Northern California, the French-born Mr. Picasso, 71, said that both Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan ''behaved very strangely,'' though he declined to elaborate.
''For me it was a very, very bad time and a lot of stress,'' he said. ''I always not only follow the rules, but I have some ethics and values. That was the first time I was confronted with someone who was completely different.''
Mr. Cohen did not respond to phone messages and e-mails seeking comment. But in court papers he has denied wrongdoing in his business matters, and generally blamed others for the difficulties his businesses have faced.
In October 2009, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan stopped making the mortgage payments on their loft. Two months later, their company was evicted from its office space for failure to pay rent. In June 2010, Bank of America started foreclosure proceedings on their home; six months later, Mr. Cohen and Ms. Sultan filed for personal bankruptcy as a married couple, even though they have never married.
Last year, they told the judge presiding over the bankruptcy case, Shelley C. Chapman, that they were still best friends but were no longer engaged. Still, Mr. Cohen continued to call Ms. Sultan his fiancée.
''We were engaged for 10 years,'' Mr. Cohen told the judge. ''And I still use the term, but this relationship has broken up a long time ago.''
They have been selling a line of designer biker jewelry called Chrome Hearts on eBay and are trying to start new businesses. But they claim to have no income.
''We are living like animals, without any ability to provide for ourselves,'' Mr. Cohen told the judge last October.
''You're living it like animals in a 10 million-dollar apartment,'' Judge Chapman retorted. ''I'm really not going to listen to this. I'm really not.''
In January, they told the judge that Ms. Sultan was about to open an acupuncture business in the Union Square area. Mr. Cohen praised her creativity in getting the business started.
''She's a little bit delayed with getting the final permits from the state to practice, so this is being done under another practitioner's license,'' Mr. Cohen said to the judge. ''But I just want to say that I'm personally in awe of what she's accomplished here. It's creative and substantial commercially.''
Ms. Sultan, who has typically let Mr. Cohen do the talking in court, said to the judge that the business had not yet opened but was already ''kind of blowing the doors open.''
''So it's been a very exciting adventure,'' she said. ''I'm obviously a very good business person, and have, and have the ability to bring on many other practitioners. So I have a plan to basically multiply revenue pretty quickly.''
BUT law enforcement authorities say she generated revenue in other ways.
In February, a city narcotics detective found an advertisement Ms. Sultan had placed on Craigslist offering prescription pain pills for sale, and arranged a meeting with her, according to the Manhattan Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor. Five times from February through June, she sold pills to an undercover officer, according to her indictment. One sale took place at the Starbucks on Union Square near the loft. In another, she sold 183 oxycodone tablets to the officer for $4,400 at a Starbucks a block from her acupuncture school.
A separate investigation into the ring that sold stolen guns and pain medication picked up Ms. Sultan sending a text message to the man accused of being the ringleader, Ivan Chavez, saying she wanted to sell him a .357 Magnum handgun for $850, according to a separate indictment by the Manhattan district attorney.
The police burst through the doors of the loft on July 12 and arrested Ms. Sultan. As she was led through the halls of State Supreme Court in Manhattan to be arraigned, she contorted her neck and torso to hide her face from news cameras, trying to avoid the attention she had commanded for most of her life.
No charges have been filed against Mr. Cohen. The two former entrepreneurs are facing a contempt charge in the bankruptcy case. Two lawyers have stopped representing them, with one telling the court that Ms. Sultan and Mr. Cohen had lied to him; the pair are now representing themselves in court. The judge and the trustee have accused them of trying to delay the sale of the apartment, which they have said is their only asset. The trustee listed the apartment for $6.25 million, which would leave them nothing after paying off debts.
Mr. Cohen has interfered with showings and frightened at least one real estate broker, according to court records.
''At a broker open house on July 2, 2012, I noticed that Cohen was carrying a handgun in the back of his pants,'' a broker with the Corcoran Group said in a sworn affidavit. ''The gun was clearly visible through his white shirt. Seeing this terrified me.''
Since the arrest, Ms. Sultan has remained on Rikers Island without the resources to make bail.
Ms. Sultan's mother, who moved to Florida 15 years ago, says she hopes for redemption for her daughter, of the sort described by a younger Jennifer Sultan in that high school yearbook 20 years ago. ''Falling down along the way, I must pick myself up and proceed with my journey,'' she wrote.

HEADLINE: Parting Is Such Sweet Revenge

BYLINE: By AIMEE LEE BALL. 
Aimee Lee Ball writes for numerous national magazines and is a co-author of four books, including ''No Time to Die.''

 BODY:
WHEN Richard M. Nixon lost the California gubernatorial race of 1962, he famously (and, as it turned out, prematurely) held a news conference avowing, ''You don't have Nixon to kick around anymore.''Fifty years later, he probably would have tweeted it.
The exit strategies of the recently unemployed have taken a new tack: social media is proving to be an outlet for those who decide that they don't want to go quietly. Whether the leave-taking is voluntary or pink-slipped, anyone with a Facebook page, Twitter account or Tumblr feed can issue a very public kiss-off to a former boss or company, abandoning the conventional career advice about not bad-mouthing an employer when leaving a job. 
After four years at a hotel in Providence, R.I., Joey DeFrancesco handed in his notice, accompanied by a dozen members of the band in which he plays trumpet, along with a friend to act as a videographer. ''My manager really hated me, and I wanted a big send-off,'' he said. He posted the video on Facebook (''for a few friends who are fellow hotel workers'') and uploaded it to YouTube, where it went viral. ''The band was playing a Serbian song,'' he said, ''so I'm even a weird minor celebrity in Serbia.''
It seems unlikely that Dan Harmon will be working for NBC anytime soon. In May, after he was fired from ''Community,'' the TV comedy he had created, he took to Tumblr contradicting a statement from the network president that implied he would have a continuing role in the show.
''I think he meant to say he's sure cookies are yummy,'' Mr. Harmon wrote. ''Guys like me can't actually just be shot and left in a ditch by Skynet,'' he added, referring to the artificial intelligence in ''The Terminator.'' ''We're still allowed to have a title on the things we create and 'help out,' like, I guess sharpening pencils and stuff.''
When Aaron Brown was fired as a CNN anchor, he was contractually precluded from speaking about it for several years. With the muzzle taken off, he was reproachful on The Huffington Post (''I didn't think the viewers were behind me when we did dumb television'') and downright cheeky on MediaBistro, where he scoffed: ''I know the difference between journalism and a slogan. 'Keeping them honest' is a slogan,'' a reference to the tagline for ''Anderson Cooper 360'' on CNN. (To which CNN responded that its coverage ''speaks for itself.'')
''I clearly took a pop at CNN,'' said Mr. Brown, who now teaches journalism at Arizona State University. ''There was no higher purpose there. When I thought about it, that's not how I wanted to be. I was trying to make a larger point, I think. One of the things I hate about TV is that everything is branded. You turn on two morning shows and see the same interview, but both shows call it 'exclusive.' ''
''Leaving a job or being fired is an amazing test of your sense of self,'' Mr. Brown said, ''and you have to think about who you are. I tried to behave nonsnarkily but still wanted to be a part of the conversation. I don't think being snarky makes the snarker look good.''
Unsurprisingly, a few denizens of Silicon Valley have engaged in digital bomb-throwing. Google's former engineering director James Whitaker blogged about his last months on the job as ''a whirlwind of desperation, trying in vain to get my passion back.''
''As I wrote, the process became cathartic,'' Mr. Whitaker said in an e-mail. ''I don't think I fully understood why I left until I wrote it down. Repercussions have been interesting. I have received a lot of praise from many friends who, like me, really miss the Google of old. There are those who are convinced I did it out of spite, and I will never change their mind.''
Although some might be concerned about backlash from an employer that is a powerful behemoth, Mr. Whitaker was sanguine. ''Free speech isn't a vague concept,'' he said.
The title of Max Zachariades's blog post at TechCrunch was ''Frustration, Disappointment and Apathy: My Years at Microsoft,'' a screed about the software giant's management style after he was fired. ''It was a way to empower myself,'' he said. ''Very often in corporate settings, there is no freedom of expression. I was told that if I took them to court, I wouldn't win -- they were too big. So instead I took the whole thing online. Social media allows a speeding up of karma.''
For sheer audacity, nothing beats the financial world, which has engendered a cacophony of tweets from executives who leave with briefcases full of golden-parachute money and seem to notice the industry's problems only when looking back over their shoulders with ''Casablanca''-like epiphanies (''I'm shocked, shocked'').
Once called the most powerful woman on Wall Street, Sallie Krawcheck took to Twitter this year after being fired from Bank of America, needing far fewer than 140 characters to take satisfying bites from the hand that no longer feeds her. (''More on the theme of big bank complexity: not Too Big to Fail, but Too Complex to Exist?'')
The ''Sayonara, sucker'' postings have spawned their own form of response and retribution. Greg Smith punctuated his departure from Goldman Sachs with an op-ed article in this newspaper about what he characterized as his former firm's ''moral bankruptcy.'' That same day, a British Web site called The Daily Mash published a parody titled ''Why I am leaving the Empire'' by Darth Vader. (''The Empire today has become too much about shortcuts and not enough about remote strangulation. It just doesn't feel right to me anymore.'')
Joshua Brown has some advice for disgruntled Wall Streeters on his blog The Reformed Broker: ''Deal with it or leave and open an Etsy store.'' Mr. Brown spent about a dozen years as a retail stockbroker, only to conclude: ''The business is one giant conflict. Even someone who wanted to do right by his clients couldn't.''
He is now a registered financial adviser, and his blog, as the name implies, is devoted to illuminating the public about the booby traps of investing. He cheerfully acknowledges the appeal of social media to express regret, disappointment or anger about a former employer.
''Social media is inherently me-centric to begin with -- all about me, where am I going,'' Mr. Brown said. ''But not everyone has to be Jerry Maguire on the way out the door.'' And social-media ranting begets social consequences. ''There are people in my former industry who won't even make eye contact with me,'' he said.
As a senior vice president at Yahoo, Brad Garlinghouse wrote an internal memo accusing the company of spreading its resources too thinly, like peanut butter on a slice of bread, with a focus ''on nothing in particular.'' As with many ''internal'' memos, the Peanut Butter Manifesto, as it came to be called, found a wide online audience, although Mr. Garlinghouse points out that he waited two more years before exiting.
''I'm generally opposed to the 'rant' or scorched earth approach when leaving a job,'' he wrote in an e-mail. But he pointed out what he calls ''a big delta'' between a genuine effort to identify problems and come up with solutions versus telling your boss off on the way out the door.
There is an ultimate homage to the idea of job-ending nose-thumbing on YouTube: a video featuring a young woman holding a succession of placards that trash her boss, starting with ''I quit,'' moving on to ''I put up with your temper and your bad breath because I wanted to be a broker,'' and finally outing him for spending ''19.7 hours per week playing Farmville.''
The video turned out to be a hoax, perpetrated by a group of punksters at a site called The Chive. But they missed an opportunity. Instead of an annoying ticking clock as the soundtrack, they could have used Don Henley's ''My Thanksgiving,'' which surely expresses the appropriate sentiment: ''Sometimes you get the best light from a burning bridge.''

HEADLINE: Running Mate Is an Upbeat Budget Cutter, Eager to Joust With Democrats

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representative Paul D. Ryan, the 42-year-old Republican named on Saturday as Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate, is idolized by young conservatives in the House, who see him as a role model and a polished spokesman for their vision of America.Many Republicans come across as dour budget cutters with contempt for Democrats. Mr. Ryan shares the politics of his conservative colleagues, but appears instead as an optimist who relishes the opportunity to debate policy with Democrats.
Mr. Ryan was first elected to Congress in 1998, at the age of 28, the youngest member of that incoming class. He vaulted to the top ranks of his party and became chairman of the Budget Committee because he knew the ropes, studied the issues and could explain conservative tax-cutting and budget-cutting policies in lucid terms. It has never been enough for him to attack Democrats and their proposals. He has always been eager to propose and defend alternatives, even at significant political risk to himself and his party. 
He is hardly a typical committee chairman, a role often played in the House by grizzled old men. An avid hunter, skier and mountaineer, Mr. Ryan listens to heavy metal and indulges in a grueling fitness regimen. At the House gym, he encourages other members to do the same as he coaches them on the intricacies of the federal budget.
Mr. Ryan is fluent -- Democrats would say glib -- in discussing the complex details of health policy.
As Budget Committee chairman, Mr. Ryan has proposed huge changes in entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid, changes that would help the federal government predict and control its costs but could shift some costs to beneficiaries and to states.
He would convert the federal share of Medicaid into a block grant, giving each state a lump sum with which to care for low-income people. States would have much more discretion over how to use the money.
To rein in Medicare costs, Mr. Ryan proposes to increase the age of eligibility, cap the growth in costs and have the government give a fixed amount of money to each beneficiary to help buy private insurance.
Democrats said the plan would destroy Medicare. Mr. Ryan did not back off. He tweaked his proposal. He would preserve the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program as an option for beneficiaries, but would force it to compete directly with commercial insurance plans.
In 2010, Mr. Ryan issued a ''Roadmap for America's Future'' that would have allowed workers under 55 to invest more than one-third of their current Social Security taxes in personal retirement accounts.
The plan would have simplified the tax code, abolishing many tax breaks and eliminating taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains.
Mr. Ryan is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over taxes, trade and Medicare.
Some Democrats call Mr. Ryan a fiscal phony, saying that by cutting taxes for corporations and the rich, he would perpetuate the deficit. President Obama recently described Mr. Ryan's budget plan as ''an attempt to impose a radical vision on our country'' and ''thinly veiled social Darwinism.''
In 2010, Mr. Ryan wrote a book with Representatives Eric Cantor of Virginia, now the House majority leader, and Kevin McCarthy of California, the party whip, setting forth their vision, ''Young Guns: A New Generation of Conservative Leaders.''
The editors of Human Events named Mr. Ryan ''Conservative of the Year'' for 2011.
But on Medicare and fiscal policy, he has sometimes worked with Democrats like Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon and Alice M. Rivlin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.
Paul Davis Ryan was born in Janesville, Wis., on Jan. 29, 1970, the youngest of four children of Paul and Elizabeth Ryan. He was 16 when his father died of a heart attack. That is one reason, he has said, for his own devotion to physical fitness.
His brother Tobin Ryan said, ''The death of my father had an enormous impact on accelerating his development.''
Mr. Ryan has been quoted as saying that his family received Social Security survivor benefits after his father's death, and that he used some of the money to help pay for college. So, he says, he appreciates the value of the program.
Mr. Ryan received a B.A. in economics and political science from Miami University in Ohio in 1992 and went to work as an aide to Senator Bob Kasten, Republican of Wisconsin. From 1993 to 1995, he worked at Empower America, a group organized by former Representative Jack F. Kemp of New York and others.
From 1995 to 1997, Mr. Ryan worked as a top aide to Sam Brownback, a Kansas Republican who was then a member of Congress and is now governor.
Before being elected, he worked at Ryan Inc. Central, a construction company founded by his great-grandfather in 1884.
Mr. Ryan and his wife, Janna, have three children, Liza, Charlie and Sam.

HEADLINE: Ryan Pick Gives President Chance to Change Subject

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
The selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as the Republican vice-presidential candidate provides President Obama with something he has been eagerly looking for -- a bigger target.A race that has revolved, at least in part, around each month's mediocre jobs report and Mr. Obama's persistent failure to move unemployment below 8 percent will now allow Democrats new lines of attack -- starting with the assertion that Republicans are intent on dismantling Medicare -- while setting off a larger debate about the role of government in the economy and society.
For Mr. Obama, that seems more promising territory, a chance to press the offensive against his challengers rather than just defend his record. Instead of a referendum on his own performance, the president has an opening to turn the election into a referendum on the vision that Mr. Ryan has advanced and Mitt Romney has adopted. 
That strategy may put Mr. Obama, a self-declared agent of hope and change four years ago, in the awkward position of seeming to be the defender of a status quo that is not working, or at least not working well enough. He risks having Republicans seize the mantle of reform that he used so skillfully in 2008 by contrasting his stay-the-course incumbent's message with the youthful Mr. Ryan's energetic willingness to tear up the old order and reinvent it for troubled times.
After months of Mr. Obama hammering Mr. Romney's prescriptions for the country as too radical, Mr. Ryan's addition to the ticket will sharpen what already had been shaping up as the starkest contrast over domestic policy in any presidential race in a generation. The president and his liberal allies wasted little time on Saturday rolling out their attacks on Mr. Ryan as an avatar of extremism who would cut health care for old people to finance tax cuts for the rich.
''The architect of the radical Republican House budget,'' declared Jim Messina, the president's campaign manager. ''Catering to the Tea Party and the far right,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader. ''Puts millionaires ahead of Medicare and the middle class,'' asserted Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who leads the Democratic minority in the House.
Within an hour or so of Mr. Romney's announcement, the Obama campaign posted a Web video labeling the Republican ticket the ''Go Back Team,'' a reference to policies of the past. Fund-raising appeals with targeted messages went out in swing states, like one in Ohio saying that Mr. Ryan ''followed in the footsteps of his mentor,'' John Kasich, the state's governor, with ''a radical, ideological budget.'' Liberal interest groups, labor unions and women's organizations began rolling out their own long-planned attacks.
The president's political strategists were focusing on Florida, already a swing state but now perhaps ground zero for attacks on Mr. Ryan's plans to restructure Medicare, while monitoring Wisconsin to see if the Republicans tried to invest in Mr. Ryan's home state. Congressional election strategists were mapping out plans to force every Republican candidate for the House and Senate to own or disown Mr. Ryan's budget plan.
''This is the perfect choice for us to finish our frame of Romney,'' said Eddie Vale, a spokesman for Workers' Voice, an A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''super PAC.'' ''What Romney and Bain did to working families and companies is what Romney and Ryan would do to all Americans.''
Bill Burton, one of the founders of Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama super PAC, said his group had always planned to devote the fall to tying Mr. Romney to Mr. Ryan's budget plan, but had worried that it might not stick.
''From the beginning when we polled, we found that the Ryan plan was the most toxic political document ever, but the problem was you couldn't convince voters that any politician would actually support it,'' Mr. Burton said. ''Now this actually makes the job easier.''
Stanley B. Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said that surveys showed attacks on the Ryan plan moved voters dramatically, adding that Mr. Romney could no longer dance around it. ''There is no longer a nuance to that debate,'' he said. ''There are a lot of white, working-class voters, particularly older ones, who will walk away now, even if tempted earlier by the slow economy.''
Mr. Obama has long suffered from a sizable generation gap. In 2008, he did poorest among those 60 and older, winning the votes of 47 percent of them compared with 66 percent of voters under 30. With polls showing younger voters less enthusiastic and less likely to turn out this year, Mr. Obama's campaign has struggled to win over seniors, who are much more reliable voters.
John Rother, president and chief executive of the National Coalition on Health Care, an advocacy group, said older voters drifted even further away from Mr. Obama during the 2010 midterm elections after Republicans attacked the Medicare cuts incorporated into his broader health care program.
''Now, Democrats can run practically the same ad accusing Ryan of proposing a plan that would 'gut Medicare' and shift costs to seniors,'' Mr. Rother said.
The Romney camp said Democrats were fooling themselves. ''The race is now framed exactly as we want it,'' said Kevin Madden, a senior Romney adviser. ''Voters are going to judge our current struggling economy and President Obama's lack of leadership on that issue very harshly, and then look at a Romney-Ryan ticket as an opportunity to take the country in a bold new direction towards a better future.''
The looming clash reflects an intriguing evolution from just two years ago, when Mr. Obama expressed a grudging admiration for Mr. Ryan, another young politician with big ideas. Asked in the fall of 2010 which Republicans he could envision working with in the next Congress, Mr. Obama mentioned only one who would still be around, Mr. Ryan.
He said Mr. Ryan was ''absolutely sincere about wanting to reduce the deficit,'' though he quarreled with his approach. ''I give him credit for at least being willing to put out there some tough choices,'' Mr. Obama said, ''although, as I said, even there, the numbers don't quite match up the way they should.''
What Mr. Obama found appealing, the notion of a man of ideas willing to make tough choices, is what he now will need to devalue him. While Democrats openly crowed that Mr. Ryan was the choice they had hoped for because of the sharp contrast, they acknowledged he is a young, attractive, well-spoken politician who explains his plan better than his fellow Republicans do. If he makes the issue the national debt that has risen so much under Mr. Obama, rather than his solution for it, Mr. Ryan could pose a serious challenge to the president.
In other words, to put the bull's-eye on Mr. Ryan's back, Mr. Obama will first have to get it off his own.

HEADLINE: Romney's Mormon Story

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
THERE'S an interesting dilemma facing the filmmakers who are presumably hard at work, in some well-hidden editing room, on the biographical movie that will play just before Mitt Romney accepts his party's nomination: What should the movie say about Romney's Mormonism?So far, Romney has said very little about his faith in this campaign, which is clearly how he likes it. Indeed, his campaign has pushed back vigorously against even innocuous press coverage of Mormon folkways and beliefs, on the theory that trying to explain a much-distrusted, much-misunderstood religion could only distract from the economic message.
But across a long summer of negative attacks, the Obama campaign has succeeded in weakening that message, and turning the conversation to Romney's character instead. This means the Republican convention can't just offer an extended indictment of the Obama record; it also needs to reintroduce Romney in a more thoroughgoing way. And if his faith ends up on the cutting-room floor, this reintroduction will be missing something that's not only essential to the candidate's life story, but also helps makes the case for his worldview. 
Start with Romney the man, so often dismissed as hollow, cynical and inauthentic. His various political reinventions notwithstanding, Romney clearly does have deep convictions: the evidence is in his intense commitment to his church, as a local leader and as a philanthropist. Between the endless hours of unpaid, ''love thy neighbor'' efforts required of a Mormon bishop and the scope of his private generosity, the caricature of the Republican candidate as a conviction-free mannequin mostly collapses.
If Romney were a Presbyterian, Methodist or Jew, this would be an obvious part of his campaign narrative. Like George W. Bush's midlife conversion or Barack Obama's tale of ''race and inheritance,'' Romney's years as a bishop would be woven into a biography that emphasized his piety and decency, introducing Americans to the Romney who shut down his business to hunt for a colleague's missing daughter, the Romney who helped build a memorial park when a friend's son died of cystic fibrosis, the Romney who lent money to renters to help them buy a house he owned, and so on down a list of generous gestures and good deeds.
The broader Mormon experience, meanwhile, could help make the case for his philosophy as well as illuminate his human core. The presumptive Republican nominee is not naturally ideological, but he's running as a critic of Obama's expansive liberalism, and as a standard-bearer for a conservative alternative.
Conservatism sometimes makes an idol of the rugged individual, but at its richest and deepest it valorizes local community instead -- defending the family and the neighborhood, the civic association and the church. And there is no population in America that lives out this vision of the good society quite like the Latter-day Saints.
Mormonism is a worldlier, more business-friendly religion than traditional Christianity, but it does not glorify wealth for wealth's sake, in the style of many contemporary prosperity preachers. Instead, as Walter Kirn suggested in an essay in The New Republic, Mormonism represents ''our country's longest experiment with communitarian idealism, promoting an ethic of frontier-era burden-sharing that has been lost in contemporary America.''
To spend some time in Salt Lake City and its environs, as I did earlier this summer, is to enter a world where faith, family and neighborliness really do seem to fill the role that liberals usually assign to the state. There you can tour the church-run welfare centers, with supermarkets filled with (Mormon-brand) products available to the poor of any faith and assembly lines where Mormon neurosurgeons and lawyers volunteer to can goods or run a bread machine. You can visit inner-city congregations where bank vice presidents from the suburbs spend their weekends helping drifters find steady work, and tour the missionary training center where Mormons from every background share a small-d democratic coming-of-age experience.
And then you can read the statistics: the life expectancy numbers showing that Mormons live much longer than other Americans, the extraordinary rate at which they volunteer and donate, their high marriage rates and low out-of-wedlock birthrates -- even the recent Gallup survey showing Utah leading all other states in a range of measures of livability.
Of course, a visit to Mormon country also provides reminders of why Romney has been wary of talking about his religious background. There's the Mormon Temple, whose interior can be viewed in scale-model form but not actually entered; the defensiveness that surfaces around issues like polygamy and race; the fine line Mormon society walks between a healthy solidarity and an unhealthy conformism -- and hanging over everything, the burden of defending Joseph Smith's revelation, which offers not only bold metaphysical claims (as all religions do) but an entire counterhistory of the Americas, which no archaeologist has yet managed to confirm.
It's understandable that Romney would prefer to keep these aspects of his religion off the table. But by trying to insulate his campaign from the things that make his faith seem alien, he's cut himself off from things that make his life story impressive, and his message compelling. If his personality seems hollow and his philosophy insincere, maybe it's because he's hidden the story of his people, and the deepest longings of his heart.

HEADLINE: Likability Index

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTONISN'T it amazing? Two introverts facing off in the brightest spotlight of all for president.
Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are at their most appealing when they are with their families.
Unfortunately, we don't often get that vantage point. And beyond those circles of trust, both men can seem as if they are sealed in their own spaceships.
The big difference, the one that will probably decide this presidential race, is this: Barack Obama is able to convey an impression of likability to voters. Given how private he is, an enigma even to some who are close to him, it's an incredible performance. 
That likability slips through your hands at closer range. The president survived a ''raised by wolves'' upbringing, as Michelle has called it. He retained the monastic skills that sustained him through the solitude of his years in New York. His ''winning smile,'' as Jonathan Alter wrote in ''The Promise,'' ''obscured a layer of self-protective ice.'' His staffers respect him, but he doesn't inspire the kind of adoration that the Bush presidents got. And the pillow-plumping romance with the press is over.
The Times's Amy Chozick wrote that the president ''has come to believe the news media have had a role in frustrating his ambitions to change the terms of the country's political discussion.''
He can be thin-skinned and insecure at times, but he radiates self-sufficiency, such a clean, simple aesthetic that he could have been designed by Steve Jobs -- Siri without the warmth.
(A poll by Purple Strategies asked which candidate seemed more like Apple, and it was, naturally, Obama.)
Yet voters see something genuine, and that is why Obama seems to be surviving the stalled economy and his own chuckleheaded remark: ''If you've got a business -- you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.''
A recent USA Today/Gallup poll showed Romney with higher marks on fixing the deficit, jobs, taxes and the economy. But Obama soared on personal traits -- maintaining a 30-point advantage in likability, and better numbers on honesty, trust and empathy.
When John Glenn was running for president, the former astronaut elicited greater applause when he came onstage than when he left. Romney started out off-putting and now makes Willy Loman look like prom king. Obama is introverted and graceful; Romney is introverted and awkward.
Romney advisers attributed his free fall in the polls to brass-knuckle Obama ads and summer doldrums rather than Mitt dullness. Maybe voters think Romney is already so sheathed in secret bubbles -- Bain, Mormonism, his stint as governor of a liberal state -- that electing him to the biggest bubble of all, the White House, would not be a good idea.
Even Republicans seem to have given up defending Mitt's charms. As John Boehner memorably put it, ''The American people probably aren't going to fall in love with Mitt Romney.''
Some say Romney waited too long to put up his biographical ads and give personal interviews, letting himself be defined and slimed by the Obama ads.
''The Obama camp can raise a 'Mission Accomplished' banner on their summer project,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor and former Obama chief of staff. ''With Romney's help, they have defined Romney as a man with total disregard for the struggles of the middle class.''
Once a candidate gains the advantage in ''Who do you want to have a beer with?'' -- even if he doesn't drink beer -- it's very hard to reverse.
When Obama does rough ads, it allays the fear that he's the sort who can get rolled by the banks, by the generals, by the Republicans in the House. When Romney does rough ads, it reinforces the fear that he's unfeeling and a bit of a bully marketed by political mercenaries.
With only two weeks to go before the convention, the question burns: Will Mitt's new mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, make his run more personable?
You can bolster your relatability with your No. 2 pick, at least with certain demographics, as Obama did with Joe Biden. But Americans like to like their president. ''You can't outsource likability,'' Emanuel says. ''You can't have an offshore account for it in the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands.''
Romney's all-business/all-family rigidity makes him seem inaccessible. And his tax legerdemain has made him seem shady. As Marc Wolpow, a former Romney employee at Bain Capital, said in a Boston Globe story about Mitt's 1988 deal with Michael Milken while the junk bond king was under federal investigation: ''Mitt, I think, spent his life balanced between fear and greed. He knew that he had to make a lot of money to launch his political career. It's very hard to make a lot of money without taking some kind of reputational risk along the way.''
In The Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Karl Rove urged Mitt to reveal his character in his convention speech by talking openly about ''his father's modest upbringing, his wife's illness and his wealth.''
Obama lost the thread of his narrative of hope and change, and Romney never developed one, even on his supposed specialty, the economy.

HEADLINE: A Team That Seems Comfortable With the Contrasts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
NORFOLK, Va. -- For their debut as the Republican ticket, Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan descended single file from the rear of the battleship Wisconsin to the soaring soundtrack of the film ''Air Force One,'' waving to a crowd of about 2,500 that had been handed small American flags.The similarities seemed to end there.
Mr. Romney, the square-jawed former executive, walked off haltingly, wearing a pressed white shirt and a powder blue tie. Not a hair was out of place. 
Mr. Ryan, the boyish-looking lawmaker, sprinted off the ship, his collar open, his shirt wrinkled and his tie left at home. A cowlick was sticking up in the back.
Throughout their first day as a team, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan emerged as a study in subtle but powerful contrasts, as different in style as they are in biography, even as they displayed real warmth and chemistry.
Mr. Romney is 65. Mr. Ryan is 42. Mr. Romney went to business and law school at Harvard. Mr. Ryan attended Miami University of Ohio. Mr. Romney spent his career in the corridors of business. Mr. Ryan mastered the halls of Congress.
Presidential campaigns are often defined by what binds the members of a new ticket: the Southern roots of the baby boomers Bill Clinton and Al Gore, the patrician pedigrees of George Bush and Dan Quayle. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan share traits as well. They are ambitious numbers guys who made their mark fairly early in their careers.
But in the ticket's unveiling, it was their differences that seemed most pronounced.
The two men had noticeably contrasting speaking styles. Mr. Romney, who prides himself on rhetorical flourishes, described his new running mate as a man who has ''never been content to curse the darkness. He'd rather light candles.'' Mr. Ryan's tone hails from Washington policy circles. He praised Mr. Romney as a man of ''principle, achievement and integrity'' and describing the election as a ''proverbial fork in the road.''
Mr. Romney quickly adapted to the chief executive's role in the new relationship, which seemed to begin as he and Mr. Ryan negotiated the still-evolving rules of their duet. In Ashland, Va., on Saturday afternoon, Mr. Ryan seemed momentarily unsure of what to do after he finished introducing Mr. Romney. He began to walk off the stage when Mr. Romney stopped him.
''Stay here! Stay here!'' he said, making clear it was a not a suggestion.
Mr. Romney has long surrounded himself with hardworking young men, serving as an eager, even avuncular mentor. So it was at times on Saturday with Mr. Ryan. During a bus ride in his motorcade on Saturday, he whipped out the ingredients for his favorite snack and taught Mr. Ryan his way of assembling a peanut butter and honey sandwich.
Mr. Ryan is not exactly known for his deference -- in Congress he is insistent, and at times impatient -- but he seemed eager to follow Mr. Romney's lead. He stood off to the side as Mr. Romney spoke at events, his hands clasped, his head vigorously nodding in agreement with his new boss.
When it was time to wade down into the audience at a rally in Manassas, a suburb of Washington, Mr. Ryan waited for Mr. Romney to go first, then fell into place a few feet behind him on the rope line, greeting voters.
When the Romney and Ryan families met on stage, smiling for the cameras, Mr. Ryan could have been mistaken for one of Mr. Romney's five sons -- a fact that Mr. Romney once playfully acknowledged to a crowd when they campaigned together in April. (''This guy here, this is not my son,'' he said of Mr. Ryan, who is the same age as Mr. Romney's oldest son, Tagg.)
Throughout his presidential campaign, Mr. Romney has struggled to excite the Republican base, emerging, in their eyes, as a squishy conservative of expediency rather than authenticity. Mr. Ryan, on the other hand, is a rock star for the movement, whose crisp, provocative policy prescriptions for overhauling Medicare and reducing the deficit have become a rallying cry for the fiscal hawks of his party.
Aides to Mr. Romney said that those distinctions -- real or imagined, superficial or significant -- are precisely what they considered part of Mr. Ryan's appeal. The congressman openly acknowledged that he would fill a void on the ticket, serving as the energetic Beltway yin to Mr. Romney's experienced corporate yang.
''I believe my record of getting things done in Congress will be a very helpful complement to Governor Romney's executive and private sector success outside Washington,'' he said.
There appears to be genuine affection between them. In their Virginia appearances, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan displayed the easy camaraderie that characterized their interactions on the campaign trail over the past few months, prompting speculation as early as this summer that Mr. Romney might select the congressman.
But as the campaign goes on, their partnership could be tested by how powerfully Mr. Romney is willing to embrace the Ryan plan for an economic overhaul, and how willing Mr. Ryan is to modulate his views for Mr. Romney's political needs.
For now, their rapport stirred the crowd. ''There is an energy there between them,'' said Joyce Brittingham, 83, who said she was struck by Mr. Ryan's youthfulness. ''I think of George Bush, the way he ran upstairs all the time,'' she said of the 43rd president.
Keith Freeman, the 51-year-old chairman of a local chapter of the Tea Party, detected a level of comfort that he has not seen between President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ''The way they look at each other when they talk,'' he said. ''There is no stiffness. They are comfortable.''

HEADLINE: Elevating the Man, and His Budget Details

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- To date, Mitt Romney has been criticized for a lack of detail behind his promise to reduce the nation's rising debt through sweeping spending cuts and tax changes, but he has also been politically insulated by it.Now, his gamble in tapping as his running mate Representative Paul D. Ryan, the author of the audacious House Republican budget plan, changes all that.
The budgets that Mr. Ryan, chairman of the Budget Committee, has pushed through the Republican-controlled House this year and last have defined nothing short of a conservative reordering of the nation's tax and spending priorities for the 21st century.
His blueprint would greatly shrink the government, largely undoing the social safety net by shifting more costs onto individuals and essentially converting Medicare into a capped voucher program. It would also alter the progressive income tax system, which, like the safety net, was built through the 20th century under Republican as well as Democratic presidents. 
The Ryan budgets were predictably blocked by the Democratic-controlled Senate and President Obama. Yet should Mr. Romney win election, it is far from clear how a Romney-Ryan budget would fare even in a friendlier Congress, given the politically and fiscally fraught particulars that Mr. Ryan and his House Republican colleagues have proposed. On Saturday, Mr. Romney's campaign quickly circulated talking points to supporters distancing him from Mr. Ryan's budgets, saying Mr. Romney ''will be putting together his own plan.''
The Ryan plan, which Mr. Romney endorsed during the hard-fought race for the Republican presidential nomination, would cut about $6 trillion from projected spending in the first 10 years. But the plan also would cut revenues by $4 trillion, and more over time, by slashing individual and corporate income taxes. The government would not run a surplus for three decades, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office -- an outcome that would have been heresy to pro-tax-cut but anti-deficit Republicans of the past.
The trajectory of Mr. Ryan's budgets and his rise in the party parallel the shift in Republican fiscal thinking on Capitol Hill and in statehouses. Though colleagues saw Mr. Ryan as an intellectual force in the party, his push to rein in federal spending was viewed with caution by party elders like Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio. Mr. Boehner, now the speaker of the House, appreciated Mr. Ryan's enthusiasm but was wary of the political implications of his plans to reshape Medicare and Social Security.
When Mr. Ryan rolled out a retooled version of his fiscal ''Roadmap for America's Future'' in 2010 amid the Republicans' battle for control of the House, Mr. Boehner lauded it but stopped short of embracing it as party policy. Yet many conservatives running that year saw in Mr. Ryan's plans just what they had sought -- a blueprint for slashing the size and scope of the federal government and unleashing business to spur the economy.
The tide of Tea Party newcomers propelled Mr. Ryan, of Wisconsin, and his fellow ''Young Guns,'' Eric Cantor of Virginia and Kevin McCarthy of California, into the House leadership. Ideas deemed extreme just a few years ago were front and center. With the allegiance and admiration of many freshman lawmakers, Mr. Ryan essentially became the House majority's ideological leader.
Still, many colleagues were unnerved early last year when, after an unpopular spending confrontation with Democrats nearly caused a government shutdown, Mr. Ryan pushed ahead with his budget remaking Medicare for future retirees. Newt Gingrich called it ''right-wing social engineering'' before backtracking, but Mr. Ryan countered that voters would reward Republicans for their willingness to make hard decisions.
When House Republicans passed the plan with few defections, Democrats were astonished -- and giddy at what they saw as a political windfall. Republicans approved a similar budget this year, and now it becomes a centerpiece of the campaign and the political debate.
Nonpartisan analyses of Mr. Ryan's proposed income tax cuts reached conclusions much like those of Mr. Romney's tax proposals in recent weeks. ''The tax cuts in Paul Ryan's 2013 budget plan would result in huge benefits for high-income people and very modest -- or no -- benefits for low-income working households,'' Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a policy research organization, wrote in summarizing the findings of the Tax Policy Center.
The center is a joint effort of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution that includes economists and tax experts with experience in both Republican and Democratic administrations. It concluded that a tax-code overhaul meeting Mr. Romney's goal -- a 20 percent cut in all rates without adding to annual budget deficits -- would leave wealthy taxpayers with a large tax cut but 95 percent of Americans with a net tax increase once tax breaks for items like mortgage interest are curtailed to keep deficits in check.
Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan would extend the Bush-era tax cuts, which are due to expire at year's end, until a rewrite of the tax code could become law.
As for spending, Mr. Ryan would not only reduce but also remake the entitlement programs, Medicare and Medicaid, whose projected growth drives the forecasts of unsustainable federal deficits as medical costs rise and the population ages.
Medicare would become a voucher program, with beneficiaries getting a fixed sum to buy private insurance; critics point out that the amount would rise at a rate unlikely to keep pace with health care costs. And Medicaid, which covers medical care for low-income people and, increasingly, nursing home care for formerly middle-class Americans, would become a block grant to states. The federal contribution would be sharply limited.
''Washington has not been telling you the truth,'' Mr. Ryan said in a short video announcing his latest plan. ''If we don't reform spending on government health and retirement programs, we have zero hope of getting our spending -- and as a result our debt crisis -- under control.''
He did make concessions to the political risks of tackling the popular entitlement programs: his proposed Medicare changes would not apply to current beneficiaries or to those within 10 years of eligibility. And unlike in 2011, when Mr. Ryan supported the eventual privatization of Social Security, he left the program untouched this year. Like Mr. Obama, he said any changes to fix its long-term finances would have to result from bipartisan compromise, protecting both parties from voter reprisals.
Analyzing the 2011 proposal for Medicare, the Congressional Budget Office said that ''most elderly people would pay more for their health care'' -- $6,400 on average by 2022 -- requiring older Americans to ''reduce their use of health care services, spend less on other goods and services, or save more in advance of retirement.'' Since then, Mr. Ryan has said beneficiaries could keep existing Medicare benefits, though that concession could significantly reduce the savings he seeks.
While most of his savings would come from the costly entitlement programs, which are about 40 percent of the federal budget, his spending reductions would be felt most, and sooner, in the so-called discretionary domestic programs -- agriculture, education, transportation, science and much more -- which account for roughly 15 percent of the budget. Mr. Ryan would not cut military spending, which is roughly 20 percent of the budget.
Mr. Romney boasts that his own tax cut plan is similar to the 2010 deficit reduction recommendations from a majority on the Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission, which Mr. Obama appointed, though the two have little in common, as panel members have said. Mr. Ryan was on that commission and opposed the majority's report, saying it would raise taxes and not cut enough from health programs.
Alice M. Rivlin, a former director of the White House and Congressional Budget Offices who was in the commission majority, said: ''Paul Ryan is a likable, attractive, smart, thoughtful conservative. He deeply believes in smaller, less intrusive government and greater personal responsibility.''
But she added, ''His budget proposals imply cuts in basic public services that few Americans would accept.''
Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, was also in the Bowles-Simpson majority. While he differed with Mr. Ryan on that panel, Mr. Coburn said in a statement that Mr. Romney had ''made an outstanding selection.''
''When most elected officials have offered only rhetoric,'' he said, ''Ryan has had the audacity to offer specifics and a plan that has transformed the landscape of American politics.''

HEADLINE: Trade Relations With Russia

 BODY:
Congress was supposed to pass a bill to improve trade relations with Russia before it left town for summer recess. That did not happen, and American companies that do business in Russia, or want to, may find themselves at a disadvantage with foreign competitors once Russia joins the World Trade Organization on Aug. 22.The issue hangs on an anachronism called the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which was enacted in 1974 to pressure Moscow to grant Jews the freedom to leave the country by effectively imposing higher tariffs on imports from the Soviet Union. Two decades later, Jewish emigration is no longer a problem, but the law is. 
Since 1992, American presidents have waived application of the law and granted Russia temporary, normal trade status, which allows lower import duties. With Russia becoming the last major economy to win admission to the W.T.O., that status needs to be made permanent. If Jackson-Vanik is not lifted, the United States will be in violation of W.T.O. rules. And American exporters will have to pay higher tariffs to Russia to enter its markets than European and Asian competitors do. The fallout for American workers should be obvious.
President Obama has made this legislation a trade priority. The business community also put it at the top of its agenda and lobbied hard for it. But some in Congress are uneasy with approving any law that seems to benefit Russia given the autocratic ways of President Vladimir Putin, his flashes of anti-Americanism and his support for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. The situation is particularly awkward for the Republicans because their presumptive presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, has recklessly and incorrectly proclaimed Russia to be America's ''No. 1 geopolitical foe.''
Repealing Jackson-Vanik should not be seen as a favor to the Putin regime. Experts say it could result in a doubling of annual American exports to Russia to $19 billion in five years. Improving trade ties would also help open the Russian economy and facilitate change. As recent street protests have shown, the middle class there is demanding more of government.
That should be reason enough to pass the bill. But the legislation also includes a provision that would have the United States ban visas and freeze the assets of people believed responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, an anticorruption lawyer who died in 2009 after a year in Russian jails. Other human rights abusers could also be made subject to these penalties.
Russia has threatened to retaliate. But this provision would be strong condemnation at a time when Mr. Putin's government has tightened control over Internet sites, protesters and nonprofit organizations.
The are some differences in the House and Senate versions of the Magnitsky provision. Congressional aides say they are close to reconciling the differences, and there are sufficient votes in both the House and the Senate to pass the overall trade bill. Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, said last week that the House would take up the legislation in September. He should make good on that promise.

HEADLINE: Romney Chooses Ryan, Pushing Fiscal Issues to the Forefrunt

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG; Michael Barbaro contributed reporting from Norfolk, Va.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney introduced Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate on Saturday at a spirited rally in Norfolk, Va., bringing to his side one of the party's young conservative leaders in a move that altered the contours of the campaign and sharpened the choice facing the voters in November.The selection of Mr. Ryan, the chief architect of the Republican Party's plan for tax and spending cuts and an advocate of reshaping the Medicare program of health insurance for retirees, was an effort to reset the race with President Obama after a withering assault on Mr. Romney by Democrats.
The decision instantly made the campaign seem bigger and more consequential, with the size and role of the federal government squarely at the center of the debate. It was a choice intended to galvanize the Republican base and represented a clear tactical shift by Mr. Romney, who until now had been singularly focused on weak job growth since Mr. Obama took office.
''There are a lot of people in the other party who might disagree with Paul Ryan,'' Mr. Romney said in announcing his vice-presidential candidate. ''I don't know of anyone who doesn't respect his character and judgment.'' 
When Mr. Ryan bounded onto the stage to join Mr. Romney, against a backdrop of the retired battleship Wisconsin, he carried a generational message; at 42, he is 23 years younger than Mr. Romney and is the same age as Mr. Romney's oldest son. Neither man has military experience or much background in foreign policy.
The announcement, which had been kept secret by the Romney campaign until the final hours, opened a weekend tour of swing states that is to continue on Sunday in North Carolina and Wisconsin. The candidates and their families are traveling together to showcase the new partnership, which they branded ''America's Comeback Team.''
For Mr. Romney, the decision is one of the boldest moves of his presidential candidacy, which has been guided by a do-no-harm strategy. It promised to energize conservatives, who had been eagerly lobbying for Mr. Ryan and who see his budget as the key to unlocking the economy's potential for growth.
Mr. Obama, who has frequently sparred with Mr. Ryan, waved to reporters as he left the White House on Saturday but did not answer questions about his Republican rivals. But his advisers said he was surprised by the decision. His campaign and the Democratic Party seized on the choice and sought to define the Republican ticket in stark terms, as two men who would strip health coverage for retirees and favor the wealthy.
As Mr. Ryan addressed a crowd of more than 2,000 admirers in Norfolk, he said that the nation was on an ''unsustainable path'' and that Republicans would not be deterred by what he said were Democratic scare tactics. It was the largest stage yet for Mr. Ryan, a native of Janesville, Wis., who was elected to Congress at age 28 and has supported some of the spending measures that helped contribute to the federal budget deficit deplored by conservatives.
''The commitment Mitt Romney and I make to you is this,'' Mr. Ryan said, smiling broadly during much of his address. ''We won't duck the tough issues; we will lead. We won't blame others; we will take responsibility. And we won't replace our founding principles; we will reapply them.''
In introducing Mr. Ryan, Mr. Romney mistakenly called him ''the next president of the United States.'' He left the stage, but quickly returned to correct himself, saying, ''Every now and then I tend to make a mistake, but I did not make a mistake with this guy.'' Mr. Ryan, who had been urged by conservatives to run for president, called Mr. Romney ''the right man to lead America back to prosperity and greatness.'' He criticized the Obama administration and declared: ''We're in a different, and dangerous, moment. We're running out of time -- and we can't afford four more years of this.''
The selection of Mr. Ryan means that this campaign is the first in 80 years in which no candidate of either major political party has served in the military. Mr. Romney, a Mormon, and Mr. Ryan, a Catholic, also represent a new era in presidential politics: neither are Protestants.
The two men share an easy rapport and a love of PowerPoint presentations and policy details.
In choosing his running mate, Mr. Romney was looking to elevate a presidential race with a candidate most likely to provide the biggest jolt. It is a gamble, his aides acknowledged, but one they believe is far less risky than Senator John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin four years ago. Several advisers said that as the author of the party's central budgetary approach, Mr. Ryan helped make their campaign look ''big,'' after months of running a race remarkably absent of specific policy proposals.
But in making his choice, Mr. Romney took political ownership of a budget that even some Republicans worry could be a liability in November. Mr. Ryan has proposed sweeping changes in entitlement programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which insure more than 100 million people and whose costs account for more than one-fifth of the federal budget. The selection suggested that Mr. Romney has settled on a strategy of maximizing his support among conservatives rather than trying to win over independent and centrist voters.
While Mr. Romney has pledged to ''protect Medicare and Social Security,'' his embrace of Mr. Ryan makes it difficult to distance himself from the well-established plans of his running mate. But the campaign suggested it would try to draw a distinction on Medicare, distributing talking points to Republicans that included the question, ''Does this mean Mitt Romney is adopting the Paul Ryan plan?'' (The answer: He applauds it ''for going in the right direction'' but will be putting together his own budget.)
A budget debate that has largely resided in Washington suddenly exploded into bigger view with Mr. Ryan's selection. Democrats seemed just as exuberant with the choice as Republicans. Mr. Obama's campaign manager, Jim Messina, argued that the Republican ticket ''would end Medicare as we know it,'' a preview of the messages that will play out in what will be the most expensive presidential campaign in history.
The announcement concluded a four-month search, conducted in public and private, with Mr. Romney inviting governors and members of Congress to campaign at his side to gauge his comfort with them. Recently, conservative leaders have loudly urged Mr. Romney to pick Mr. Ryan, but most Republicans assumed Mr. Romney would go with someone seen as safer.
Advisers said Saturday that Mr. Romney had called Mr. Ryan with his offer on Aug. 1, almost immediately upon arriving home from a trip to Britain, Israel and Poland. That detail, which was confirmed by an associate close to Mr. Ryan, deflated speculation that Mr. Romney made his choice in reaction to an outcry that broke out last week, most notably on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, which argued forcefully on behalf of Mr. Ryan.
Mr. Romney called the other finalists on Friday evening, aides said, and thanked them for their cooperation in the vetting process and their help with his campaign. He did not tell them his choice, but word began spreading overnight that Mr. Ryan had emerged as the lone contender.
Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, who was passed over four years ago by Senator John McCain, wished Mr. Ryan well on Saturday. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, who was also seen as a top prospect, said Mr. Ryan was a ''great choice.''
The selection was announced as Mr. Romney moves into a critical period leading to his nomination at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., at the end of the month. His standing in several battleground states has fallen over the summer, after an aggressive effort by the Obama campaign to define him on their terms. Republicans hoped the vice-presidential announcement would start the race anew, as well as help make Mr. Ryan's native Wisconsin more competitive.
But Mr. Ryan will face questions about his readiness to be president. He has no foreign policy experience and has not spent significant time in the private sector, but the Romney campaign is counting on his youthful charisma and intellect to sustain him through a bruising presidential campaign.
''We're not going to besmirch the office of the presidency by succumbing to the kind of attacks and vile charges that are coming from the Democrats,'' Mr. Romney said during a stop in Ashland, Va., as he and Mr. Ryan campaigned across the state.
The choice heartened senior Republicans, some of whom have worried that Mr. Romney's campaign has become mired in the often small back-and-forth with the Obama campaign without asserting a positive vision.
''He had two decisions to make: Governing or political, and bold or comfortable,'' Karl Rove, the Republican strategist, said Saturday. ''And he decided to go governing and bold.''
Mr. Romney's rapport with Mr. Ryan was on display again on Saturday as they locked arms after walking out to the soaring music of the ''Air Force One'' film soundtrack. Mr. Romney wore a tie without a jacket and Mr. Ryan wore a jacket without a tie.
Mr. Romney, who is not known for his warmth, patted Mr. Ryan on the back 10 times. When Mr. Ryan finished his remarks, Mr. Romney whispered a word into his ear. ''Perfect,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Big-Data Investing Gets Its Own Supergroup

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: The Data Collective, a new fund specializing in Big Data investments, claims to have 35 equity partners with lots of experience in the field, to find deals, build companies and work on exits. 

 BODY:
 Big Data is getting a council of wise men. With money.
The Data Collective is a fund specializing in investments in companies doing everything from creating large, complex databases and faster processing of information from diverse sources, to applications that make use of novel and interesting patterns that might be exploited. The initial fund is small, but the outfit clearly has some very large ambitions.
"We're at the start of a multibillion-dollar economic shift based on cheap bandwidth, storage and computing, and an explosion of data," said Zachary Bogue, one of four partners organizing the fund. "Everything has become substantially cheaper for a start-up, and there are lots of areas to disrupt."
There is a lot of that kind of talk going on now, since our increasingly connected world has created sensors everywhere and lots of cheap computing in the cloud. What sets the Data Collective apart is that it already includes 35 equity partners who have a lot of experience in the field.
Early investors in the first fund, some $6 million, include Gil Elbaz, whose Applied Semantics became a critical part of Google AdWords, and who now runs a large data marketplace called Factual; Todd Papaioannou, the former chief cloud architect at Yahoo, whose new company, Continuuity, is working on a way to build software applications using lots of data; and Abdur Chowdhury, the former chief scientist at Twitter, who recently formed a company called Pushd to look at ways to gain insights from mobile phone data.
"People like this can help with deals, development and exits," Mr. Bogue said. "They know the technology, and they can make recruiting calls to lots of people. They know a lot of interesting things that are going on, and like to see what new stuff is going on."
A second fund, about $50 million, is currently being raised, according to several people familiar with its operations who asked not to be identified. Mr. Bogue said he could not comment on any continued fund-raising.
Mr. Bogue is already known as an early investor in the payments company Square and as a co-founder of the Founder's Den, an office space in San Francisco that houses a number of start-ups. Other partners managing the fund include Matt Ocko, a veteran of Softbank who was also a seed investor in Zynga; Mike Driscoll, a founder of Metamarkets, which offers cloud-based data analysis; and Bradford Cross, who founded a company called Prismatic, which looks at an individual's media consumption to build a customized news feed.
The fund has already made 46 investments, Mr. Bogue said, in companies including Kaggle, a kind of crowdsourced statistical analysis service; keen.io, whose products let mobile application developers collect and analyze data, and Citus Data, whose cloud-based database is claimed to be several times faster than Oracle's most advanced offering.

HEADLINE: Libor Case Energizes a Wall Street Watchdog

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The Barclays rate-manipulation case has thrust Gary Gensler - and his once-obscure agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission - into the spotlight. 

 BODY:
Months after he arrived in Washington in 2009, Gary Gensler knew he had a big case.
Huddled around his assistant's desk with a colleague, Mr. Gensler, then Wall Street's newest regulator, listened to a taped telephone call of two Barclays employees discussing plans to report false interest rates. When the brief recording ended, Mr. Gensler realized the gravity of the wrongdoing.
"We need to make this case even more of a priority," he told his colleague at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Stephen Obie, who already had been investigating Barclays for more than a year.
 The Barclays case has now thrust Mr. Gensler - and his once-obscure agency - into the spotlight.
In June, the commission reached a settlement with Barclays in the rate-manipulation case, which produced the largest fine in the agency's nearly 40-year history. The deal is expected to be the first of many, as Mr. Gensler's team leads a global investigation into rate-rigging at more than a dozen big banks.
It is a new role for the agency, the industry's smallest regulator. For years, it was viewed as the Rodney Dangerfield of the regulatory world, with a light touch and little respect.
When the agency first opened the rate investigation in 2008, some banks dismissed the regulator, telling it to narrow the focus to a particular time period or trading desk. Barclays questioned whether the American regulator had the authority to examine a British bank, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Now, Wall Street is taking the commission more seriously.
Along with the inquiry into rate manipulation, the agency is playing a central part in several prominent investigations, examining the blowup of MF Global and the multibillion-dollar trading loss at JPMorgan Chase. Mr. Gensler has also aggressively - some say obsessively - pushed the agency to adopt dozens of new rules under the Dodd-Frank law, the financial regulatory overhaul.
"The change is night and day," said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, the co-author of the sweeping law that bears his name.
"It was a toothless agency," he said, but when "Gary became chairman, he was very aggressive."
The agency's revival stems from the wave of new regulation. Dodd-Frank, passed in 2010, greatly expanded the responsibility of the agency, stretching its reach to the dark corners of the $300 trillion derivatives market. Before that, the agency oversaw the $40 trillion futures business.
Mr. Gensler has positioned himself as a chief advocate of the law, initially lobbying lawmakers to close loopholes and now overseeing the flurry of rule-making at his agency. After a long career at Goldman Sachs and a stint in the Wall Street-friendly Clinton administration, the job has given Mr. Gensler a shot at redemption.
But Mr. Gensler and his agency have faced a steep learning curve with the bureaucratic and political ways of Washington.
To win support from fellow regulators, Mr. Gensler has agreed to dial back some rules. And while the agency's rule-writing has outpaced other financial regulators, the trading commission has missed multiple deadlines for completing the crackdown on derivatives, a central cause of the 2008 crisis.
Mr. Gensler has also drawn the ire of Congressional Republicans, who say his commission is overstepping its authority. Some bankers have taken aim at the agency, saying its rules threaten profits.
"No one likes their regulator right now, however good they are, and Gary is good," said Eugene Ludwig, head of the Promontory Financial Group and a former bank regulator who knew Mr. Gensler from their days in the Clinton administration.
The new identity of the agency reflects the personal evolution of its leader.
A math whiz who grew up in a working-class Baltimore neighborhood, Mr. Gensler attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After an 18-year career at Goldman Sachs as a mergers and acquisitions banker and later an executive, he joined the Treasury Department.
At the time, the department oversaw the broad deregulation of the same markets Mr. Gensler now oversees. In 2009, some liberal lawmakers stalled Mr. Gensler's nomination to the commission, fearing that he remained a banker at heart.
Mr. Gensler, a father of three daughters, agrees that he has yet to shake his penchant for deal-making. When negotiating over the wording of a rule, he still props up his socked feet on an employee's desk, a habit common to bankers. His efforts now, however, are directed at reforming the industry that once made him millions.
"I think what we're trying to do is bring common-sense rules of the road to this really important marketplace," he said in an interview.
As Congress debated Dodd-Frank, Mr. Gensler was a ubiquitous presence on Capitol Hill, pressuring lawmakers to beef up the details. The day the law became final, he stayed past 4 a.m. with Blanche Lincoln, then a senator from Arkansas, putting the finishing touches on several provisions.
"I told him that Dodd-Frank was his baby because he labored with it for at least nine months," said Michael Dunn, a former C.F.T.C. commissioner who works at Patton Boggs.
With the intensity of a longtime banker, Mr. Gensler has pushed his staff to finish the rules promptly. He is an avid reader of the "Dodd-Frank Progress Report," from the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, a publication that tracks rule-writing. Once, when he mistakenly thought the publication failed to count a C.F.T.C. rule, Mr. Gensler phoned a lawyer at the firm to request a correction.
A marathon runner and mountain climber, his fixation with speed has made him a brusque taskmaster at times.
Last year, when a small earthquake forced the agency to evacuate its offices, Mr. Gensler arranged a staff meeting at a cafe in the building's lobby. The employees, he said, could not afford to lose an afternoon of work.
Despite his demanding pace, colleagues say he is quick to compromise. When Scott O'Malia, a Republican commissioner of the agency, urged Mr. Gensler to tweak a complex derivatives rule, they convened the so-called Meiwah summit, referring to the Chinese restaurant in Washington where they completed a deal.
Mr. Gensler has also built relationships with other agencies, as they collaborate on Dodd-Frank. Mr. Gensler was a mock senator when Mary L. Schapiro, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, prepared for her confirmation hearing. Ms. Schapiro once baked cupcakes for Mr. Gensler's birthday.
"Together we can make this the most successful partnership in government," she wrote in his copy of the Dodd-Frank law.
Even so, some industry players paint Mr. Gensler as a stubborn negotiator with a knack for haranguing Wall Street. He was a co-author of a book, "The Great Mutual Fund Trap," that criticized the industry in which his twin brother, Robert, works.
And after two Wall Street trade groups sued the agency over a rule curbing speculative trading, Mr. Gensler took a harsh tone with one executive who came to the commission to lobby on the issue. "You sued us, so it's clear what you think about the rule," he said, dismissing the executive's concerns, said a person briefed on the meeting.
Bristling at the sometimes-abrasive approach, Republican lawmakers have fought to freeze or depress the commission's $205 million budget.
While the figure is a fraction of other regulatory budgets, lawmakers and lobbyists say Mr. Gensler could cut costs by tempering his ambitions.
"I wonder if Mr. Gensler is more focused on building a personal legacy and expanding his agency's powers than making the economy stronger and safer," said Steven Lofchie, a partner at the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.
Others, however, have praised Mr. Gensler for marshaling resources and stepping up the agency's game. Mr. Gensler has sharply increased his staff to more than 700 employees. He also hired a former federal prosecutor, David Meister, as the head of enforcement.
The agency, which has previously had big cases against energy companies, brought a record number of enforcement actions last year, notably against Wall Street firms.
"We've come into our own as a regulator to be reckoned with, out there doing our best to protect investors and consumers every day," said Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner.
The rate-rigging case is the commission's biggest investigation yet. The case centers on how banks set a key benchmark, the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which affects the cost of borrowing for consumers and corporations.
The investigation heated up after Mr. Gensler heard the Barclays recording. As the examination broadened, the agency assigned additional employees to the case, nearly 15 enforcement lawyers, up from three.
Mr. Gensler also championed measures to prevent Barclays from repeating its mistakes. The new controls forced the bank to report rates based on actual transactions when possible and to prevent conflicts of interest.
After more than four years of investigating, the agency filed its action against the bank on June 27. For Mr. Gensler, it was a bittersweet day. While it was the biggest moment in his regulatory career, it also was the sixth anniversary of his wife's death from breast cancer.
Publicly, he has focused on the win. "It's about the integrity of the market," Mr. Gensler said. "This agency stood up for the public and said that rates have to be based on honest figures."

HEADLINE: For Asia, So Far, Paul Ryan Remains Out of Focus

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: In Beijing, Tokyo, Seoul and other major capitals across Asia, the early reaction to Representative Paul Ryan's selection as Mitt Romney's running mate was muted on Sunday. One commentator said Mr. Ryan "ticks most boxes" for the Republican candidate, while another said he might restrain Mr. Romney's "potentially disastrous China-bashing." 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - The official Chinese news agency and state-run media outlets on the mainland offered little commentary on the selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as the running mate of Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.
Asian commentators seemed more stumped about Mr. Ryan than European editorialists did - as my Rendezvous colleague Harvey Morris explained from London. 
Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, and state-controlled newspapers offered only straight news stories about Mr. Ryan on Sunday, as they presumably awaited editorial direction from government and Communist Party officials in Beijing. 
Basic stories also predominated in other Asian capitals, from Jakarta, Manila and Bangkok to Tokyo, Seoul and New Delhi. 
"For Mr. Romney, Mr. Ryan ticks most boxes - he shores up the fiscally conservative base, excites the Tea Party movement and doubles-down on his claim to be the economic-fixer," said John Barron said of ABC News in Australia. 
Many of Mr. Ryan's country-specific foreign policy views remain largely unknown, at least publicly, if only because his political career has been so heavily focused on domestic tax and budget issues. He is chairman of the House Budget Committee, and he sits on the Ways and Means Committee and the health subcommittee.
Mr. Ryan's ideas on the new "pivot" of U.S. military assets toward the Asia-Pacific; regional disputes in the South China Sea; an unstable Pakistan; a nuclear North Korea under a new dictator; recent reforms in Myanmar; arms sales to Taiwan; newly adopted military relationships, and other issues in Asia have yet to be spelled out in detail.
But Mr. Ryan, 42, who has proposed new increases in U.S. defense spending, has spoken forcefully about his vision of American exceptionalism and a continued need for U.S. global leadership, which he connects directly to the country's economic prosperity.
"Economic growth is the key to avoiding the kind of painful austerity that would limit our ability to generate both hard and soft power," Mr. Ryan said in a speech to the Alexander Hamilton Society last summer. 
"Take a moment to imagine," he added, "a world led by China or Russia. So we must lead."
Eli Lake, writing on The Daily Beast, said Mr. Romney's selection of Mr. Paul "tilts the ticket closer to the neoconservatives on key questions about America's role in the world and the size of the military." 
Elliott Abrams, a deputy national security adviser under President George W. Bush, has been briefing Mr. Ryan on the Middle East in recent months. He told Mr. Lake that Mr. Ryan was "relaxed, serious, funny, very smart, and knows more about foreign policy than people may think, in view of his concentration on the economy."
Uri Friedman, in an April blog post for Foreign Policy magazine, hit several bullet points of Mr. Paul's world view, including a brief take on China: 
Ryan appears to be less hardline and hawkish about China than Romney, who has pledged to designate Beijing as a currency manipulator on his first day in office. True, Ryan has shuddered at the idea of a world led by China and Russia and criticized China's restrictions on freedom of expression, "coercive population controls," and "unsound economic policies." 
But he's also argued that "we stand to benefit from a world in which China and other rising powers are integrated into the global order with increased incentives to further liberalize their political and economic institutions."
John Tamny, in Forbes, seconds the notion that Mr. Ryan might well soften the anti-China rhetoric at the top of the Republican ticket and "walk Romney back from his economically illiterate and potentially disastrous China-bashing." 
Mr. Ryan has not sponsored any China-related legislation in the House, although he voted against a bill in September 2010 that took aim at countries that manipulate their currencies to gain trade advantages. The bill, which passed the House 348 to 79, did not reach a vote in the Senate. 
The measure did not specifically mention China, but its intent was unmistakable. My colleagues David Sanger and Sewell Chan, reporting on the House vote, said it "sent an unusually confrontational signal to the Chinese leadership" by giving the Obama administration "expanded authority to impose tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports to the United States."
David and Sewell said the bill's passage was "a highly unusual bipartisan vote at a time when large numbers of House Republicans have rarely joined Democrats on an economic issue." Ninety-nine Republicans voted for the measure. 
"We should welcome the contributions and strengths that over one billion people can offer and push for the government of China to give those people space to express their personal, religious, economic and civil ambitions," Mr. Ryan has said, quoted by Jennifer Rubin, a conservative columnist and blogger for The Washington Post. (Her column is posted on Mr. Ryan's Web site.) 
"A liberalizing China is not only in the interests of the world," he said, "but also in China's own best interest as it copes with the tremendous challenges it faces over the next couple of decades."
Ms. Rubin added that Mr. Ryan has made it "clear that China has 'very different values and interests from our own.' "
In another statement on his Web site, Mr. Ryan said "engagement in Afghanistan is necessary," adding that Mr. Obama's planned withdrawal "has the potential to pose security threats to soldiers continuing shorthanded counter-insurgency operations, as well as to compromise the larger mission in Afghanistan.
"Further, the Afghan citizens currently working with our troops to quell violence may view the withdrawal as a signal that our forces are no longer committed to the mission, which will serve to debilitate the long-term diplomatic, development and reconstruction efforts in the area."
Joseph J. Collins, a professor of national security strategy at the National War College in Washington, met with Mr. Ryan and a congressional delegation before they went to Afghanistan. 
"He was supremely well briefed and had thought through the issues," Mr. Collins told Rendezvous. "His team or five or six congressmen deferred to him but had their own concerns.
"Of course, his moderate attitude on Afghanistan seemed to be 'stay the course,' " Mr. Collins said. "Many concerns about costs, which post-2014 will come down tremendously. Both Romney and Obama have said little about Afghanistan. I suspect that politically, it is a no-win issue for either candidate."

HEADLINE: Ryan Brings the Tea Party to the Ticket

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Paul Ryan's ascendency to No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket is a signal event for a movement that counts him as one of their own. If Mitt Romney wins in November, a Tea Party favorite will be a heartbeat from the Oval Office. 

 BODY:
For two years, Tea Party lawmakers in the House have been the stubborn barbarians at the gate, strong-arming their often reluctant Republican colleagues by refusing to compromise on spending, taxes, debt or social policy.
But Paul Ryan's ascendency to the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket is a signal event for a movement that counts him as one of their own. If Mitt Romney wins in November, a Tea Party favorite will be a heartbeat from the Oval Office.
More than that, Mr. Ryan is now unquestionably the face of the Tea Party caucus in Washington, and his success is certain to embolden House lawmakers whose proudly unyielding approach to governance has contributed to legislative gridlock.
Once considered a fringe of the conservative coalition, Tea Party lawmakers are now indisputably at the core of the modern Republican Party.
"Gov. Romney's selection of Congressman Paul Ryan is an excellent choice and a game changer for the presidential election," Representative Kevin Brady of Texas said in a statement. "It's now a campaign of ideas on how best to get this economy moving again, balance the budget and restore America."
He added: "My guess is that Barack Obama has a sick feeling in his stomach today."
For Romney, the decision to pick Mr. Ryan has quickly helped to validate him in the eyes of skeptical Tea Party members in the House. Many in the movement had worried that a President Romney would hardly be an ally for their legislative goals.
Choosing Mr. Ryan eases those concerns even as it marks a shift in the movement's balance of power. 
"Selecting someone like Paul Ryan, who is so popular with Tea Party activists, proves that Mitt Romney is committed to addressing the economic issues that have been troubling our nation for the last four years," Amy Kremer, the chairwoman of the Tea Party Express, the movement's largest political action committee, said in a statement.
Mr. Ryan, in his speech accepting the role of Mr. Romney's running mate, touted his ability to reach across the aisle to find solutions that are workable to members of both parties.
"I have worked closely with Republicans as well as Democrats to advance an agenda of economic growth, fiscal discipline and job creation," Mr. Ryan said.
But his success may help to harden the political impasse in Washington between Democrats and Republicans, and between the House and the Senate. A huge post-election debate is looming over the fate of the Bush-era tax cuts and entitlement spending, and Mr. Ryan has been urging Tea Party members to stand firm.
If Republicans win the White House in the fall but fail to take the Senate from Democrats, Tea Party members in the House may see even less reason to compromise on their drive to make the federal government smaller.
"Congressman Ryan wants the same thing we do: to pass pro-growth policies and shrink the size and scope of government," said Chris Chocola, president of the Club for Growth. "No one understands the dire consequences we face by continuing to ignore our spending problem better than Congressman Ryan, and no one can do a better job of articulating a vision of how to fix it."
Within the Tea Party caucus, Mr. Ryan is not the most absolutist. He voted for the TARP bailout of big banks at the end of George W. Bush's term. And he voted for the bailout of the auto industry. Both actions are anathema to some Tea Party lawmakers. And in some ways, he is not the Tea Party archetype. A seven-term congressman who has worked in Washington his entire career, Mr. Ryan is an insider-type politician who works from within the system, not against it.
But as chairman of the House Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan has resisted pressure from some in his party's leadership to compromise with Mr. Obama's administration in the interests of a grand bargain that many Tea Party members see as selling out.
And his far-reaching budget plans have attracted Tea Party support for the same reason that they have generated such fierce Democratic opposition: because they would go so far in reshaping the country's long-standing fiscal obligations.
Mr. Obama's campaign released a 90-second video attacking Mr. Ryan on Saturday. The video uses an old clip of the newly minted vice presidential nominee bragging that "I put out a very comprehensive plan rewriting the health care system, Medicare, Social Security, our entire tax system."
The Democrats intend that as an attack, but for Tea Party members it is a de facto mission statement.
Three years ago, the Tea Party movement emerged as a way of protesting Mr. Obama's health care legislation. Members followed up with a wave of political victories in the 2010 midterm elections that gave the movement a strong - if not always organized and coherent - voice in the Congress.
Now, Mr. Ryan's place on the national ticket testifies to the staying power of the Tea Party ideology and provides a single person around which the movement can coalesce. When he delivers his remarks at the Republican National Convention in Tampa later this month, Mr. Ryan will be speaking for the Tea Party as much as anyone else.
Tea Party activists are still likely to make some mischief at the convention, just as some of the movement's lawmakers in the House Republican caucus will no doubt find reasons to fault Mr. Ryan.
But every movement needs someone to help it focus. For the Tea Party, Mr. Ryan appears to be that man.

HEADLINE: New Republican Ticket Keeps Focus on Obama's Record

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: An energized crowd in North Carolina hears from the new Republican ticket. 

 BODY:
MOORESVILLE, N.C. - On his second day as Mitt Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan slammed President Obama, telling an energized crowd in North Carolina on Sunday that Mr. Obama had had his chance to fix the ailing economy but had failed.
"We've got a big job ahead of us," Mr. Ryan told the crowd of a few thousand at the NASCAR Technical Institute. "We can't keep letting this government spend money we don't have. We can't keep letting this government mortgage our children's future and we can't keep this government-centered society and government-run economy drive us into the ground in a state with unemployment like 9.4 percent in North Carolina."
He said that President Obama came into office with promises of hope and change and, with Democrats controlling Congress, passed his agenda of health care reform and stimulus, only to get a budget that doubled the debt.
Mr. Romney followed Mr. Ryan in addressing the crowd, telling them how delighted he was in having his running mate out on the trail with him, remarks that were greeted with chants of "Paul, Paul Paul" from the crowd.
"I am so happy, I am so happy to have my teammate now, the two of us! It's now two on two you know," Mr. Romney said.
"And this is a guy with extraordinary character," Mr. Romney continued. "Grew up young, cause his dad passed away young, and has been a man of character and integrity and vision. He's the kind of leader we need to have in Washington.
"He hasn't spent all his time attacking people on the other side of the aisle," Mr. Romney said of his running mate. "He's tried to find people among the Democrats that he can work with and try to make change that would help the American people. He recognizes that honest people can have honest differences."

HEADLINE: Obama Says He Fundamentally Disagrees With Ryan's Vision for the Country

BYLINE: JODI KANTOR


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama speaks about the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Paul D. Ryan, for the first time since Mr. Ryan was chosen by Mitt Romney. 

 BODY:
CHICAGO - President Obama addressed his rival's vice-presidential choice for the first time on Sunday, calling Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin a nice guy whose leadership would be a national disaster.
"Congressman Ryan is a decent man, he is a family man," the president said, quieting boos from the audience, but also a spokesman "for a vision I fundamentally disagree with." 
Speaking to hundreds of young supporters at the second of five fund-raising events he is holding here Sunday, Mr. Obama wove Mr. Ryan seamlessly into the speech he has been making for months. In a sense, Mr. Ryan has made Mr. Obama's rhetorical job easy: for months, the president has argued that the election is a choice between two different paths for the country, and that the Romney/Ryan path of aggressive budget cutting and deregulation will lead to yet more economic suffering. So he dropped just a few words about Mr. Ryan into his address, describing the anxiety and insecurity he said Mr. Ryan's proposed policies would cause.
"It's not speculation, it's on their Web sites," he said. "They have tried this before, they have tried to sell us this trickle down fairy dust before."
Through an accident of timing, Mr. Obama finds himself back in the places that created his career - Chicago and Iowa - just as the fight to defend his presidency takes on new definition. Sunday's events provided a miniature snapshot of the president's fortunes at the moment. On the one hand, his central argument - that the election is a choice between two visions for the country - received a shot of rhetorical energy from Mitt Romney's selection of Mr. Ryan, who has argued for changes to Medicaid and Medicare as a way of cutting the deficit. 
On the other hand, Mr. Obama is trailing in the money, and his Chicago "birthday" trip is a frenetic dash for cash, from the large, low-dollar event at the arts center to a party in his own backyard with a $40,000 admissions fee.
The Obama campaign does not release fund-raising tallies for individual events, but a simple series of numbers tells the story of their efforts to raise cash. The president and the first lady are dividing and conquering, with Mr. Obama in Chicago and the first lady covering the Rocky Mountains and California over the course of several days. Admission to the arts center was low, with some supporters admitted for as little as $51, a bargain price to see a sitting president up close. Though the Obama campaign declared the event sold out, the loftlike space looked about half full. (A campaign official later said that a thousand donors attended, beyond initial expectations.) Meanwhile, Mark Knoller of CBS, an unofficial archivist of the presidency, said he could not remember another occasion in which a sitting United States president held a fund-raiser in his own home.
The arts center event also provided an unplanned contrast with Saturday's scene at Mr. Romney's announcement. That took place on the decommissioned U.S.S. Wisconsin in Virginia, in front of what looked like a mostly white crowd. The Bridgeport Art Center sits on a barren block of Chicago's South Side, and Mr. Obama spoke front of a diverse, young audience.
Just outside, another reminder of the politics of Chicago's South Side was visible on the sidewalk. Members of Chicago's Occupy Wall Street group covered the pavement with chalked statements of protest: "Unhappy 51 to Obama," the pastel message said. "Stop killing brown people with your drones."

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan's Liberal Fan Club

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: Strategists at the pro-Obama super PAC are excited to run against the budget proposals of Mitt Romney's running mate. 

 BODY:
There is one point on which Democratic strategists and the hard right are united: they fervidly support Mitt Romney's decision to choose Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, as his vice-presidential running mate.
Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who works for the pro-Obama "super PAC" Priorities USA Action, declared in an interview with the Times just before Romney's running mate was unveiled that picking Ryan "would legitimately make the Ryan budget the centerpiece of the Republican platform and Romney would own it from soup to nuts."
Erick Erickson, whose Redstate blog is a force on the right, sounded the warning:
Finally, the Romney campaign has a spokesman who can do what Mitt Romney has never been capable of doing - defend success and articulate a message of why we must reform our nation's budget and support free markets. After all the Romney campaign missteps and flubs of the past few weeks, I am encouraged. But we should be clear here: it is not enough, but it is an excellent start to a reboot.
The editorial pages of The Wall Street Journal, The Weekly Standard, National Review and a host of bloggers say that putting Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, on the ticket gives the presidential election the ideological clarity it deserves.
The Wall Street Journal, in an Aug. 8 editorial, "Why Not Paul Ryan?" declared:
Against the advice of every Beltway bedwetter, he has put entitlement reform at the center of the public agenda - before it becomes a crisis that requires savage cuts.
After Ryan was announced, the Journal argued that Romney had in one stroke changed the direction and thrust of the campaign.
Mr. Romney is signaling that he realizes he needs a mandate if he is elected, which means putting his reform ideas before the American people for a clear endorsement. He is treating the public like grown-ups, in contrast to President Obama's focus on divisive and personal character attacks.
From Friday, before the announcement, to Saturday morning just after 9, when it became public knowledge, the mood on the right shifted 180 degrees.
In a column posted on the National Review Web site nine hours before the Ryan pick was broadcast, the conservative polemicist Mark Steyn had nearly written off the Romney campaign:
Romney's insipid message does not rise to the challenge this nation faces. Maybe the milquetoast pantywaist candy-assed soft-focus "Believe in America" shtick will prove sufficient under a relentless barrage of nakedly thuggish attack ads designed to Barry Goldwater the guy. But John Podhoretz, editor of Commentary, thinks not: 'This is a race he should be able to win,' he wrote, 'so if he loses, it won't be because Obama won it. It will be because he lost it.' "
Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, published a lament along similar lines on Aug. 8:
At times over the past few months, it has seemed that the Romney campaign has embarked on audacious experiment to see if it's possible to run a presidential campaign devoid of real interest.
By the evening of Aug. 11th, however, all doubts had disappeared. A National Review poll of its online readership showed an overjoyed political right: 92 percent of 10,493 "voters" declared that they were "excited about Romney-Ryan."
None were more excited that the editors themselves, who wrote in a lead editorial called "Just the Ticket" that "while Ryan has a national reputation as a budget cutter, he is a full-spectrum conservative."
Both left and right view the Ryan budget as the ticking time bomb of the 2012 election, although they disagree about who will suffer the most political damage when it explodes.
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a well-respected liberal think tank, describes the Ryan budget this way:
The new Ryan budget is a remarkable document - one that, for most of the past half-century, would have been outside the bounds of mainstream discussion due to its extreme nature. In essence, this budget is Robin Hood in reverse - on steroids. It would likely produce the largest redistribution of income from the bottom to the top in modern U.S. history and likely increase poverty and inequality more than any other budget in recent times (and possibly in the nation's history).
The Ryan plan, which has received majority backing twice from Republicans in the House and once from Republicans in the Senate, calls for a major retrenchment of the welfare state.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities,
Even as House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's budget would impose trillions of dollars in spending cuts, at least 62 percent of which would come from low-income programs, it would enact new tax cuts that would provide huge windfalls to households at the top of the income scale. New analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center finds that people earning more than $1 million a year would receive $265,000 apiece in new tax cuts, on average, on top of the $129,000 they would receive from the Ryan budget's extension of President Bush's tax cuts. The new tax cuts at the top would dwarf those for middle-income families. After-tax incomes would rise by 12.5 percent among millionaires, but just 1.8 percent for middle-income households. Low-income working families would actually be hit with tax increases.
In addition, the budget Ryan presented to the House in April last year called for the elimination of taxes on capital gains and dividend income. Romney pointed out in a January 2012 debate that "Under that plan, I'd have paid no taxes in the last two years."
Even more important, in political terms, those now under 55 would face an utterly transformed Medicare when they reached 65, a health care program that would steadily shift costs to beneficiaries. The Ryan budget would also cap total federal Medicaid spending, which would force sharp reductions in eligibility and coverage.
In an e-mail to the Times, Robert Shapiro, under secretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs under President Bill Clinton, wrote:
Medicare is voucherized and then increases at GDP [Gross Domestic Product] growth + 1 percent per -year, versus actual increases in health care costs averaging over the last two decades 5.7%; and Medicaid is block-granted at current levels and grows at the rate of overall inflation - and neither formula takes account of increases in the number of recipients.
Medicaid is currently the single largest source of support for long-term care of the elderly and disabled. While just over three-quarters of Medicaid recipients are children and families receiving basic health coverage, 64 percent of all Medicaid dollars go for the most expensive care (of old people in nursing homes and of the disabled), according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Most of the elderly population is not equipped to absorb higher medical costs. Almost half of those over the age of 65 depend on Social Security for 80 percent or more of their total income. At the start of 2012, the average annual Social Security benefit was $14,760.
William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, and Stephen F. Hayes, a senior writer there, see the cost-cutting Ryan budget as a plus:
Republicans own the Ryan budget. And so does Mitt Romney. The question, it seems to us, is not whether Republicans and their presidential nominee own the Ryan budget, but how they choose to talk about it. Republicans shouldn't worry about having entitlement reform as part of the campaign debate; they should want it there. The 2012 campaign should be about leadership, and about the failure of Barack Obama to provide it on the big issues, including - especially - on entitlement reform, debt, and deficits.
Bill Burton, who was Obama's deputy press secretary and is now a senior strategist at Priorities USA, is delighted to see Romney wrap his arms around Ryan: "The Ryan budget is one of the most toxic documents that a political party has ever embraced," Burton said in a phone interview with The Times (which was also conducted before Ryan was unveiled). When Priorities USA tested reactions to specific provisions of the budget in focus groups, according to Burton, the participants thought the cuts were so draconian that "they couldn't believe a politician would support those policies."
The momentum behind the Ryan plan within the Republican Party is so strong that Romney has had no qualms about giving it his blessing. In a March 22 interview with a Milwaukee radio station, Romney defended the controversial package of budget and tax cuts:
It's time to tell people the truth. And if they want to vote for something less than the truth, that's their right. But I've got a campaign of telling people the truth and I believe the American people are ready for the truth and understand that all of the promises and the attacks and so forth that are part of the political process have to be pushed aside for the truth. And so my campaign's about telling people we've got to cut back on our spending and finally live within our means or we could face economic calamity where what we've gone through over the last three years would look like a cakewalk.
Conservatives joyful over the selection of Ryan contend that whatever damage Democrats can inflict on Romney with the Ryan budget will be more than made up for by two factors: the willingness of the Republican ticket to forthrightly campaign on a detailed economic agenda, and Ryan's appeal to white voters, including many blue-collar and Catholic voters.
Fred Barnes of The Weekly Standard argues that a Romney-Ryan ticket will now be equipped to take on the Obama White House:
Mitt Romney, the cautious candidate, wary of being specific, and counting on the bad economy to defeat President Obama - forget all that! The Romney who picked Paul Ryan as his vice presidential running mate is an entirely different person. He's prepared to take the fight to Obama on the biggest bundle of issues - spending, debt, the deficit, taxes, entitlements, and the reversing of America's accelerating decline under Obama. Specifics? There will be plenty.
National Review stresses Ryan's Catholicism:
One strength he brings to the ticket is a grounding in the social teaching of the Catholic Church, to which he belongs, and a willingness to engage with those who thoughtlessly equate this teaching with support for an ever expanding welfare state. These traits could have more than parochial interest this year, because a disproportionate number of Catholic voters are up for grabs.
The overarching strategy of the Romney campaign is to turn out as many white voters as possible in a contest that may well come down to turnout on Election Day.
The Ryan budget, however, tackles a broad array of domestic social spending, and in slicing Medicare and Medicaid, Ryan's plan imposes harsh costs on a very large proportion of white voters. An overwhelming majority of Medicare recipients, 78 percent, are white. Just 9 percent are black, 8 percent Hispanic, 2 percent Asian-American and 3 percent "other." A solid plurality, 43 percent, of Medicaid recipients are white, 22 percent are black, 28 percent Hispanic and the rest are "other."
A February 2012 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities of all federal entitlement programs - Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, unemployment insurance, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (welfare), the school lunch program, Earned Income Tax Credit, and the refundable Child Tax Credit - finds that non-Hispanic whites, who make up 64 percent of the nation's population, received 69 percent of the total benefits. Hispanics, who make up 16 percent of the population, received 12 percent of the payments, and blacks, who account for 12 percent of the population, received 14 percent of the benefits.
The Obama campaign and its allies are preparing to show that the Ryan plan will severely cut social insurance programs that not only provide help to poor people, but also to many in the middle class, including millions and millions of whites. The Romney campaign and its supporters, in turn, will try to make the case that these programs go disproportionately to the undeserving (and heavily minority) poor, who should not be subsidized by taxpayer dollars.
Until now, the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA has concentrated its commercials attacking Romney on his stewardship of Bain Capital, especially on decisions by the company to put businesses Bain acquired into bankruptcy, to close plants and to lay off workers. It has done so in part because of the focus group findings that voters were reluctant to believe that a mainstream politician would back the scope of cuts called for in the Ryan proposal.
Those Democratic anti-Bain ads, according to Burton, have been designed to soften up the electorate to make it possible to run, in the near future, commercials linking Romney to the Ryan budget. The anti-Bain commercials have the long-range goal, in Burton's words, of "building a 'thought structure' among voters of a guy who makes decisions based on profits, and not on the concerns of middle class families." Adding Ryan to the ticket serves to greatly facilitate development of this "thought structure."
Which brings us to another problematic aspect of Romney's decision to pick Ryan. The very qualities that attract the right to Ryan - his ideological purity and his verbal dexterity in making the case for smaller government - are very likely to eclipse Romney, who despite the boldness of his choice still projects a weak political persona and ideological ambiguity. No candidate willingly demotes himself from first to second fiddle, but Romney has chosen to do so.
In this context, Fred Barnes paid the ticket a backhanded compliment:
Romney showed that, like a smart businessman, he knows his shortcomings. For all his attacks on Obama's economic policies, Romney has failed to create a sense of urgency about the country's faltering economic situation. And without a national fear of an impending catastrophe, he can't defeat Obama.
Romney's solution, Barnes wrote, is to get someone who can: "No one in America is better than Ryan in spelling out, with figures and facts, the crisis America faces."
For very different reasons, Democrat strategists like Burton and Garin would agree.

HEADLINE: Officials Defend Fatal Shooting of a Knife-Wielding Man Near Times Sq.

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Wendy Ruderman, Michael Schwirtz and Kate Taylor contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The New York police officers who fatally shot a knife-wielding man after he escaped arrest near Times Square did what they were trained to do, city officials and experts on police procedure said Sunday.Two officers fired 12 shots at the man, Darrius H. Kennedy, after he ignored their orders on Saturday to drop the long kitchen knife he had been waving as he skipped backward down Seventh Avenue, frightening the tourists wandering around on a summer day, police officials said. At least seven of those bullets hit Mr. Kennedy, including three shots to the chest, the police said.
Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner, said that he thought ''the police responded appropriately'' and that the number of rounds the officers fired was not unusual. Police officials said officers tried six times to subdue Mr. Kennedy with pepper spray, without effect. None of the officers at the scene had Tasers or other stun guns, the police said. 
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg agreed with Mr. Kelly, saying the officers ''probably acted in responsible ways'' in trying to stop ''somebody who must have been mentally deranged.'' He added that ''taking a knife and going after other people, particularly police officers, isn't something that a sane person would do.''
Police officials said they did not know whether Mr. Kennedy, 51, had a history of mental troubles. But they said that in October 2008, he was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center for a psychiatric evaluation after he was found knocking over garbage cans in Times Square. Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said he did not know the results of that evaluation.
A month later, in November 2008, Mr. Kennedy was arrested near Lincoln Center after he threatened to harm police officers with a screwdriver when they tried to stop him from harassing drivers on Broadway, Mr. Browne said. He was sentenced to 40 days in jail for resisting arrest.
Mr. Kennedy had not had any run-ins with the New York City police since then, according to Mr. Browne. He said the police believed that Mr. Kennedy had been unemployed but did not know where he had been living. The last known address for him was in Hempstead, on Long Island.
Marcus Bryan, 27, who sells self-produced CDs in Times Square, said he had spoken several times to the man who was shot on Saturday, though he did not know his name. He said the man would dress up as a ninja, in black clothing with a black mask, and do back flips for tips.
Keith Watson, 31, who was selling tickets to a comedy club, also identified the man who was shot as ''the Times Square ninja,'' but did not know his name. ''He's never had an actual blade before,'' Mr. Watson said. ''It was a play sword. He's a regular here.''
An aunt of Mr. Kennedy's, Mary Johnson, said by phone that she had not noticed anything out of the ordinary when her nephew visited her home in Hempstead in June. She said he had been living in Manhattan in recent years, doing odd jobs like cleaning buildings.
Ms. Johnson was critical of the police. ''This could have been handled in a different way,'' she said. ''It doesn't take 12 or 15 bullets to kill a horse, so it wouldn't take that many to kill a person.''
But Charles H. Ramsey, commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department, said officers were trained to aim for ''center mass,'' not the limbs of a suspect, when using deadly force.
''You can't just sit and watch people get hacked to death or have an officer get slashed,'' Mr. Ramsey added.
The episode -- bizarre even by the standards of Times Square -- sent tourists running for cover (or their cellphone cameras), but nobody other than Mr. Kennedy was in danger of being shot, Mr. Browne said. He said that no police officers or civilians were in the line of fire when the two officers shot their 9-millimeter pistols from close range.
By that point, the police had backed Mr. Kennedy up to the entrance of an office building on Seventh Avenue near 37th Street and had hemmed him in with a patrol car parked perpendicular to the sidewalk, Mr. Browne said. The two officers in that car jumped out and ordered Mr. Kennedy to drop his weapon, a nearly foot-long kitchen knife with a six-inch blade.
When he moved within three feet of the officers, still holding the knife, the police said, they let loose a burst of bullets, drawing gasps from the rapt witnesses. Some of them had trailed the police down the avenue, capturing the drama in photographs and video.
One officer fired nine shots, and the other fired three, Mr. Browne said. He added that neither officer previously fired a weapon in the line of duty.

HEADLINE: A Clause That Could Salvage The Classic

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
The N.H.L. can cancel the Jan. 1 Winter Classic at 115,000-seat Michigan Stadium as late as Jan. 1, the day of the game, because of a work stoppage ''arising from the lack of a collective bargaining agreement,'' the contract between the league and the University of Michigan shows.The league would forfeit only $100,000 of its $3 million stadium rental fee, according to the contract. The rest of the fee would be refunded by the university.
The contract provisions give the league some leeway for salvaging its showcase event should a lockout delay the start of the 2012-13 season, enabling the N.H.L. to hold the Winter Classic even if a lockout is settled in late December. 
A lockout seems increasingly likely after Commissioner Gary Bettman said Thursday that ''the owners are not prepared to operate under this collective bargaining agreement for another season.''
The current agreement between the league and the players' union expires Sept. 15, and the two sides seem far apart.
The league's initial offer, made July 13, proposed cutting player salaries by 24 percent and offered what Bettman called tweaks to the current limited revenue-sharing plan between rich and poor clubs.
The union's initial offer, to be made Tuesday in Toronto, is expected to volunteer no salary cuts and propose broad changes to revenue sharing.
The economic pressure generated by the lucrative Winter Classic could act as a brake against the loss of the entire N.H.L. season. The last time Bettman and the N.H.L. owners locked out the players, in 2004-5, the full season was lost.
This Classic would match the Detroit Red Wings against the Toronto Maple Leafs in Ann Arbor, Mich., before an anticipated capacity crowd, which would break the world record for hockey attendance.
The Winter Classic is the centerpiece of NBC's coverage of the N.H.L., for which the league receives about $200 million a year. The Leafs, the first Canadian team in the Winter Classic, are Canada's most popular club. Their presence would ensure huge viewership on CBC, which pays the league $100 million a year for television rights.
The game also produces millions in ticket, sponsorship and advertising revenue for the league.
The N.H.L.'s contract with Michigan, approved by the university's board of regents on Feb. 9, contains provisions that treat a work stoppage in a way similar to a ''force majeure'' cancellation brought about by act of God, riot, weather, disaster or any other cause beyond the league's control.
''It's standard for us to include force majeure provisions in virtually all of our contracts,'' said Bill Daly, the N.H.L. deputy commissioner, ''and if we anticipated the possibility of a work stoppage in particular, it certainly wouldn't have been unusual.''
Donald Fehr, the executive director of the players' union, declined to comment.
According to the contract, the N.H.L. will have the use of Michigan Stadium from Dec. 1, when construction of the ice rink on the stadium floor can begin, through Jan. 9, when removal of the rink must be finished. The game can be played only on Jan. 1 or, in case of bad weather, Jan. 2. There is no provision in the contract for the Winter Classic to be played at Ann Arbor later in 2013 because of a work stoppage or for any other reason, and Daly said last week that there was no other agreement to play the game later in the year.
The N.H.L.-Michigan contract stipulates that the league forfeit $100,000 if it cancels the Winter Classic before Nov. 3. On Nov. 3 or after, a cancellation would cost the league $100,000 and any expenses incurred by the university in connection to the game.
The contract does not cover an associated slate of outdoor games at Detroit's Comerica Park involving Red Wings and Maple Leafs alumni teams as well as N.C.A.A., minor league and junior teams. None of those would be officially affected by an N.H.L. work stoppage, but it is unclear whether they would be played if the Winter Classic were canceled.
Comerica Park is owned by the Ilitch family, which also owns the Red Wings.

HEADLINE: European Countries Compete to Attract, and Retain, Foreign Students

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE

 BODY:
THE HAGUE -- British graduates looking to work at the supermarket chain Tesco might be surprised to learn that speaking Mandarin fluently and being open to a move to China can go a long way toward getting a good job with the company.''The fact that someone has a foreign cultural background can be advantageous,'' said Nannette Ripmeester, who runs Expertise in Labor Mobility, an international job-matching company based in the Netherlands.
Europe, like the rest of the global economy, increasingly needs highly educated workers. And like Tesco, a British company, many European businesses see value in workers who hold a domestic degree but bring an international background to the job. 
Despite the elimination of a visa program in Britain, a call to enforce visa rules strictly in France, and tuition fee increases in Britain and Sweden in recent years, experts say that most European countries are trying to attract foreign students in the hope that once trained they will stay and join the work force.
As in the rest of the world, student migration is booming in Europe. In 2010, just under 850,000 non-Europeans were studying there, up from almost 660,000 in 2005, according to Unesco figures.
European countries, however, have a harder time retaining foreign students after they graduate than ''destination'' countries like Australia, Canada and the United States, in part because the path to citizenship is seen as easier there and opportunities for social mobility are greater.
''A lot of students are going abroad as a part of strategic career planning,'' said Wei Shen, who is associate dean for China at Essca, a management school in France, and studies student migration. ''They are not interested in permanent settlement in Europe.''
Though some European nations naturally attract students from specific countries -- France, for example, enjoys popularity among Africans from French-speaking nations -- other countries are trying to increase their popularity among foreigners.
A study released this year by the Migration Policy Group, a nonprofit organization, compared the strategies and success rates of five European countries -- Germany, France, Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden -- in attracting and retaining non-European students.
The Netherlands, for example, was found to do well in retaining students in comparison with the other countries, not only because of its respected postsecondary institutions and relative good value of degrees, but also because bureaucratic forms were easily available and because English is widely spoken in the country, facilitating integration into society.
''The language is not a barrier,'' said Hans de Wit, a professor at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and an adviser on the study. ''It is a positive factor in the Netherlands.''
Of the five countries profiled, the Netherlands was least likely to be the first choice among foreign students who ended up studying there, with only 59.4 percent of respondents saying the country had been their preference.
When doctoral students were asked whether they would be staying in their host country of choice, those who answered from the Netherlands were more likely to want to stay than those answering in France or Britain.
The level of language proficiency among incoming students was much higher in Britain, France and Germany than in the Netherlands or Sweden, because the first three countries' languages are more commonly spoken around the world. And, while all five countries offer programs entirely in English, living in Germany or France tends to be more difficult without a working knowledge of the national languages.
Germany was found to have the highest percentage of students willing to say for the long term, with 12.5 percent predicting that they would stay five or more years after finishing their study. While the investment many make in learning the German language before or during study plays a role, a strong job market, especially in the engineering sector, also contributes to Germany's success in retaining foreign graduates, said Ludger Pries, the chairman of the sociology department at the Ruhr-University in Bochum.
''Germany got a lot from globalization,'' he said, ''and now there's a big push to bring globalization to German firms.''
Under a new law, Germany gives recently graduated foreigners more time to find employment -- 18 months rather than 12 -- and has made obtaining permanent residency easier for them, especially if they are fluent in German.
Over all, however, a vast majority of students said that the quality or reputation of the university and study program was the most important factor in determining where to go.
''All these countries want to market themselves as a leading student destination,'' said Mr. Shen, who was an academic adviser on the study.
While European officials and academics adjust postgraduate programs, language course subsidies and the availability of information in English, a change in national policy can quickly undo years of progress.
For example, a memorandum released in May 2011, known as the circulaire Guéant after the interior minister who issued it, instructed French officials to adhere more strictly to regulations when processing work-visa requests. Stories of foreign students in France waiting vainly for their work visas affected France's reputation as an attractive study destination.
A year after the directive was issued, a new French government rescinded it.
''It is very damaging for the country,'' Mr. Shen said of the directive. ''The perception of the students is very important.''
Similarly, last April's elimination of the Tier 1 visa in Britain, which allowed a two-year work permit for foreign graduates of British universities, had a negative effect on postgraduate integration.
In June, the McKinsey Global Institute published a study predicting that the global economy would need an additional 38 million to 40 million college-educated workers by 2020. While many of these new jobs will be in Asia, Europe will need at least 16 million to 18 million more highly skilled workers, the study predicted.
As the need for highly trained workers and the desire for multinational backgrounds increase, European governments and universities will continue to compete to attract foreign students and keep them in the country.
Tesco, on the other hand, promises a permanent move to China after six months' training in Hertfordshire, England.

HEADLINE: Israeli Official Calls for Declaration That Diplomacy on Iran Has Failed

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Amid intensifying Israeli news reports saying that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is close to ordering a military strike against Iran's nuclear program, his deputy foreign minister called Sunday for an international declaration that the diplomatic effort to halt Tehran's enrichment of uranium is dead.Referring to the Iran negotiations led by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany, the minister, Danny Ayalon, told Israel Radio that those nations should ''declare today that the talks have failed.'' After such a declaration, if Iran does not halt its nuclear program, ''it will be clear that all options are on the table,'' Mr. Ayalon said, not only for Israel, but also for the United States and NATO.
Asked how long the Iranians should be given to cease all nuclear activity, Mr. Ayalon said ''weeks, and not more than that.'' 
The comments came after a frenzy of newspaper articles and television reports over the weekend here suggesting that Mr. Netanyahu had all but made the decision to attack Iran unilaterally this fall. The reports contained little new information, but the tone was significantly sharper than it had been in recent weeks, with many of Israel's leading columnists predicting a strike despite the opposition of the Obama administration and many military and security professionals within Israel. Articles in Sunday's newspapers also examined home-front preparedness for what experts expect would be an aggressive response not just from Iran but also its allies, the militant groups Hezbollah and Hamas.
''Lord help us, would you just do it already and be done with it?'' wrote Ben Caspit, a columnist for the newspaper Maariv, referring to the Israeli leadership. ''When one looks around the impression received is that it isn't only in Israel that they aren't being taken seriously any longer, but the world refuses to get worked up over them either.''
''Maybe they'll bomb Iran in the end just to prove that they're serious,'' Mr. Caspit added.
Mr. Netanyahu and his top ministers have been saying for weeks that while the sanctions against Iran have hurt its economy, they have not affected the nuclear program, which Iran's leadership insists is for civilian purposes. On Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Silvan Shalom called on the United States to enact ''even more extensive and even more comprehensive sanctions which could overwhelm the Iranian regime and possibly even topple it, or bring it to make the decision to abandon the nuclear program.''
The mixed messages from Mr. Shalom and Mr. Ayalon came two days after Mr. Netanyahu called Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general of the United Nations, and urged him not to go to Iran for a meeting scheduled for the end of this month of the so-called nonaligned nations (countries that were not allies of either the United States or the Soviet Union during the cold war).
''Even if it is not your intention, your visit will grant legitimacy to a regime that is the greatest threat to world peace and security,'' Mr. Netanyahu told Mr. Ban, according to a statement released by his office Friday night. ''Not only does it threaten countries throughout the Middle East, not only is it the greatest terrorism exporter in the world, but it is impossible to exaggerate the danger it presents to Israel.''
''Mr. Secretary General, your place is not in Tehran,'' Mr. Netanyahu added.
At a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Mr. Netanyahu seemed to be trying to rebut the Israeli newspaper articles questioning domestic preparedness as he bid farewell to the current home-front defense minister, who is becoming ambassador to China.
''There has been a significant improvement in our home-front defense capabilities,'' Mr. Netanyahu said, according to a transcript released by his office. ''One cannot say that there are no problems in this field because there always are, but all of the threats that are currently being directed against the Israeli home front pale against a particular threat, different in scope, different in substance, and therefore I reiterate that Iran cannot be allowed to have nuclear weapons.''

HEADLINE: Libor Case Energizes a Wall Street Watchdog

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Months after he arrived in Washington in 2009, Gary Gensler knew he had a big case.Huddled around his assistant's desk with a colleague, Mr. Gensler, then Wall Street's newest regulator, listened to a taped telephone call of two Barclays employees discussing plans to report false interest rates. When the brief recording ended, Mr. Gensler realized the gravity of the wrongdoing.
"We need to make this case even more of a priority," he told his colleague at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Stephen Obie, who already had been investigating Barclays for more than a year.
The Barclays case has now thrust Mr. Gensler - and his once-obscure agency - into the spotlight. 
In June, the commission reached a settlement with Barclays in the rate-manipulation case, which produced the largest fine in the agency's nearly 40-year history. The deal is expected to be the first of many, as Mr. Gensler's team leads a global investigation into rate-rigging at more than a dozen big banks.
It is a new role for the agency, the industry's smallest regulator. For years, it was viewed as the Rodney Dangerfield of the regulatory world, with a light touch and little respect.
When the agency first opened the rate investigation in 2008, some banks dismissed the regulator, telling it to narrow the focus to a particular time period or trading desk. Barclays questioned whether the American regulator had the authority to examine a British bank, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Now, Wall Street is taking the commission more seriously.
Along with the inquiry into rate manipulation, the agency is playing a central part in several prominent investigations, examining the blowup of MF Global and the multibillion-dollar trading loss at JPMorgan Chase. Mr. Gensler has also aggressively - some say obsessively - pushed the agency to adopt dozens of new rules under the Dodd-Frank law, the financial regulatory overhaul.
"The change is night and day," said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, the co-author of the sweeping law that bears his name.
"It was a toothless agency," he said, but when "Gary became chairman, he was very aggressive."
The agency's revival stems from the wave of new regulation. Dodd-Frank, passed in 2010, greatly expanded the responsibility of the agency, stretching its reach to the dark corners of the $300 trillion derivatives market. Before that, the agency oversaw the $40 trillion futures business.
Mr. Gensler has positioned himself as a chief advocate of the law, initially lobbying lawmakers to close loopholes and now overseeing the flurry of rule-making at his agency. After a long career at Goldman Sachs and a stint in the Wall Street-friendly Clinton administration, the job has given Mr. Gensler a shot at redemption.
But Mr. Gensler and his agency have faced a steep learning curve with the bureaucratic and political ways of Washington.
To win support from fellow regulators, Mr. Gensler has agreed to dial back some rules. And while the agency's rule-writing has outpaced other financial regulators, the trading commission has missed multiple deadlines for completing the crackdown on derivatives, a central cause of the 2008 crisis.
Mr. Gensler has also drawn the ire of Congressional Republicans, who say his commission is overstepping its authority. Some bankers have taken aim at the agency, saying its rules threaten profits.
"No one likes their regulator right now, however good they are, and Gary is good," said Eugene Ludwig, head of the Promontory Financial Group and a former bank regulator who knew Mr. Gensler from their days in the Clinton administration.
The new identity of the agency reflects the personal evolution of its leader.
A math whiz who grew up in a working-class Baltimore neighborhood, Mr. Gensler attended the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. After an 18-year career at Goldman Sachs as a mergers and acquisitions banker and later an executive, he joined the Treasury Department.
At the time, the department oversaw the broad deregulation of the same markets Mr. Gensler now oversees. In 2009, some liberal lawmakers stalled Mr. Gensler's nomination to the commission, fearing that he remained a banker at heart.
Mr. Gensler, a father of three daughters, agrees that he has yet to shake his penchant for deal-making. When negotiating over the wording of a rule, he still props up his socked feet on an employee's desk, a habit common to bankers. His efforts now, however, are directed at reforming the industry that once made him millions.
"I think what we're trying to do is bring common-sense rules of the road to this really important marketplace," he said in an interview.
As Congress debated Dodd-Frank, Mr. Gensler was a ubiquitous presence on Capitol Hill, pressuring lawmakers to beef up the details. The day the law became final, he stayed past 4 a.m. with Blanche Lincoln, then a senator from Arkansas, putting the finishing touches on several provisions.
"I told him that Dodd-Frank was his baby because he labored with it for at least nine months," said Michael Dunn, a former C.F.T.C. commissioner who works at Patton Boggs.
With the intensity of a longtime banker, Mr. Gensler has pushed his staff to finish the rules promptly. He is an avid reader of the "Dodd-Frank Progress Report," from the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, a publication that tracks rule-writing. Once, when he mistakenly thought the publication failed to count a C.F.T.C. rule, Mr. Gensler phoned a lawyer at the firm to request a correction.
A marathon runner and mountain climber, his fixation with speed has made him a brusque taskmaster at times.
Last year, when a small earthquake forced the agency to evacuate its offices, Mr. Gensler arranged a staff meeting at a cafe in the building's lobby. The employees, he said, could not afford to lose an afternoon of work.
Despite his demanding pace, colleagues say he is quick to compromise. When Scott O'Malia, a Republican commissioner of the agency, urged Mr. Gensler to tweak a complex derivatives rule, they convened the so-called Meiwah summit, referring to the Chinese restaurant in Washington where they completed a deal.
Mr. Gensler has also built relationships with other agencies, as they collaborate on Dodd-Frank. Mr. Gensler was a mock senator when Mary L. Schapiro, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, prepared for her confirmation hearing. Ms. Schapiro once baked cupcakes for Mr. Gensler's birthday.
"Together we can make this the most successful partnership in government," she wrote in his copy of the Dodd-Frank law.
Even so, some industry players paint Mr. Gensler as a stubborn negotiator with a knack for haranguing Wall Street. He was a co-author of a book, "The Great Mutual Fund Trap," that criticized the industry in which his twin brother, Robert, works.
And after two Wall Street trade groups sued the agency over a rule curbing speculative trading, Mr. Gensler took a harsh tone with one executive who came to the commission to lobby on the issue. "You sued us, so it's clear what you think about the rule," he said, dismissing the executive's concerns, said a person briefed on the meeting.
Bristling at the sometimes-abrasive approach, Republican lawmakers have fought to freeze or depress the commission's $205 million budget.
While the figure is a fraction of other regulatory budgets, lawmakers and lobbyists say Mr. Gensler could cut costs by tempering his ambitions.
"I wonder if Mr. Gensler is more focused on building a personal legacy and expanding his agency's powers than making the economy stronger and safer," said Steven Lofchie, a partner at the law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.
Others, however, have praised Mr. Gensler for marshaling resources and stepping up the agency's game. Mr. Gensler has sharply increased his staff to more than 700 employees. He also hired a former federal prosecutor, David Meister, as the head of enforcement.
The agency, which has previously had big cases against energy companies, brought a record number of enforcement actions last year, notably against Wall Street firms.
"We've come into our own as a regulator to be reckoned with, out there doing our best to protect investors and consumers every day," said Bart Chilton, a Democratic commissioner.
The rate-rigging case is the commission's biggest investigation yet. The case centers on how banks set a key benchmark, the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which affects the cost of borrowing for consumers and corporations.
The investigation heated up after Mr. Gensler heard the Barclays recording. As the examination broadened, the agency assigned additional employees to the case, nearly 15 enforcement lawyers, up from three.
Mr. Gensler also championed measures to prevent Barclays from repeating its mistakes. The new controls forced the bank to report rates based on actual transactions when possible and to prevent conflicts of interest.
After more than four years of investigating, the agency filed its action against the bank on June 27. For Mr. Gensler, it was a bittersweet day. While it was the biggest moment in his regulatory career, it also was the sixth anniversary of his wife's death from breast cancer.
Publicly, he has focused on the win. "It's about the integrity of the market," Mr. Gensler said. "This agency stood up for the public and said that rates have to be based on honest figures."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tough Love In a Tough Job Market

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
''Get to Work,'' an eight-episode reality series that begins Monday on the Sundance Channel, sounds from the title as if it might help the mainstream unemployed -- the middle-income victim of downsizing, the blue-collar laborer whose factory has closed -- find employment. It won't.What it will do, perhaps, is make you sympathize a bit with another class of jobless people who have a doubly difficult road. The series presents the plight of those who would probably be unemployed even without the economic downturn because they have criminal records, histories of drug abuse, poor work habits or other problems. 
''Get to Work'' looks in on the service organization Second Chance in San Diego, which administers a job-placement program using a model called Strive that was originally developed in East Harlem. It is a back-to-basics, no-nonsense approach, as the series makes clear.
''Twenty percent of you in this room are full of it,'' an instructor tells the class early in the four-week program. ''You don't want to work. You just want to look like you're doing something. Because going to work every day is a real commitment.''
There are punishments for being late in returning from the class's 10-minute break. There are urine tests. The instructors emphasize that personal responsibility is the main prerequisite for the class, and they are refreshingly fearless about throwing out of the program those who don't demonstrate it.
The students who remain earn your sympathy, either for their eagerness to turn their lives around or for their cluelessness about their own limitations, and what it takes to get and hold a job. Though these people may not resemble any job seekers you know, the portraits feel about as honest as reality TV gets.

HEADLINE: Wondering How Far Magazines Must Fall

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
Making a weekly newsmagazine has always been a tough racket. It takes a big staff working on punishing deadlines to aggregate the flurry of news, put some learned topspin on it and package it for readers. But that job now belongs to the Web and takes place in real time, not a week later.Tina Brown may have understood the digital insurgency that was disrupting the publishing business, but that didn't stop her from stepping into the maw at the end of 2010, after Sidney Harman bought Newsweek. She married her Web site, The Daily Beast, with Newsweek in an attempt to put the paddles to a franchise gone cold, but Mr. Harman is now gone and his family has withdrawn its financial support. With losses continuing to pile up, that leaves IAC/InterActiveCorp, which also owns The Daily Beast, holding the bag. 
As the former editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, Ms. Brown was an odd choice to be Newsweek's savior. Even in its diminished state -- Mr. Harman bought it for a dollar in addition to assuming some $40 million in liabilities -- the magazine is aimed at a mass audience in the kind of Middle America places where Ms. Brown, a hothouse flower of Manhattan media, rarely visits. Still, she has been able to maneuver The Daily Beast into the middle of the conversation and she has never lost her touch for getting people talking. But a newsweekly is a brutal, perhaps unwinnable, challenge.
Because of changes to the informational ecosystem, weeklies have been forced to leave behind the news and become magazines of ideas. Ms. Brown understood that; it's just that some of her ideas weren't always very good. Sometimes she tried too hard -- Barack Obama was depicted as the first gay president -- and sometimes not hard enough, as with last week's cover about fancy dining around the world.
People who predicted that her effort would come to tears might be tempted to do an end zone dance now. But that would be dumb. The problem is not Tina Brown or her conceptual obsessions, or even the calcified formula of the weekly magazine.
The problem is more existential than that: magazines, all kinds of them, don't work very well in the marketplace anymore.
Like newspapers, magazines have been in a steady slide, but now, like newspapers, they seem to have reached the edge of the cliff. Last week, the Audit Bureau of Circulations reported that newsstand circulation in the first half of the year was down almost 10 percent. When 10 percent of your retail buyers depart over the course of a year, something fundamental is at work.
I talked to an executive at one of the big Manhattan publishers about the recent collapse at the newsstand and he said, ''When the airplane suddenly drops 10,000 feet and it doesn't crash, you still end up with your heart in your stomach. Those are very, very bad numbers.''
Historically, certain categories of magazine will encounter turbulence, but this time all categories were punished in the pileup. People was down 18.6 percent, and The New Yorker had a similar drop, declining by 17.4 percent. Vogue and Cosmopolitan were down in the midteens, and Time fell 31 percent. When Cat Fancy is down 23 percent at the newsstand, it seems that there's little place to hide. Newsweek, it should be mentioned, was off only 9.7 percent at the newsstand, but that's cold comfort.
Ms. Brown has been criticized over tarting up Newsweek's cover -- last week the disembodied lips of a woman were awaiting a dangling piece of asparagus -- but she does stuff like that because in the fight for the American consumer, magazines are losing. Yes, it was a cheesy grab for attention -- akin to Time's cover gambit of having a 4-year-old hanging off his mother's breast -- but magazines are nothing if not desperate these days.
(Still, it would be hard to come up with a more tin-eared summer feature than ''101 Best Places to Eat in the World'' at a time of great economic uncertainty. ''People should lighten up,'' Ms. Brown said in a phone call. ''Not every Newsweek cover should be about the dreary economy.'')
It's not just consumers who are playing hard to get: advertising is down 8.8 percent year to date over the same miserable period a year ago, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. With readership in such steep decline and advertising refusing to come back, magazines are in a downward spiral that not even their new digital initiatives can halt.
It is true that Ms. Brown did not change the fortunes of Newsweek, but it is also true that the magazine was pretty much dead by the time she got her hands on it. Ms. Brown remains convinced that after her very public move away from magazines, her decision to grab Newsweek was a good one.
''I know as well as anyone that the shift to digital has reached a tipping point,'' she said. ''Everyone is facing the same set of challenges we are -- I think we've actually done very well by comparison -- but with The Beast and Newsweek, we continue to have brands that resonate in very different ways. We just need to decide where to take that in the current environment.''
That decision now lies with Barry Diller, the chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp and the sole patron of Newsweek. Mr. Diller was anything but reassuring in an earnings call on July 25.
''The transition to online from hard print will take place,'' Mr. Diller said. ''We're examining all our options.'' He added: ''I'm not saying it will happen totally.''
In a phone call over the weekend, Mr. Diller said he was speaking in general terms about the industry and not signaling the imminent end of the print artifact, but he did emphasize that the losses at the magazine were not sustainable -- ''advertising went away at precisely the wrong time after the deal closed.''
Even though the Harmans are no longer sharing the costs, Mr. Diller said: ''I like the challenge. Every bit of research tells us this is a solid, global brand.'' He said that he and Ms. Brown would have a plan for the brand/magazine/franchise, whatever it is, by January.
Mr. Diller clearly appreciates Ms. Brown as both a confidante and a friend, but he is hardly a softy when it comes to business matters and bears no special affection for print.
For people like Mr. Diller -- or, more grandly, the folks over at Time Warner -- who run public companies, continued investment in magazines is going to be a little tough to explain. The best case story involves investing a lot right now in the hope that someday, years from now, the businesses will stabilize. That doesn't sound like a very attractive place to store capital.
Ultimately, it doesn't matter what you put on the cover of your magazine if no one will look at you. A few weeks ago, I was in a busy doctor's office with a dozen others, absently paging through the magazines on the table. The table in front of us was stacked with the pride of American publishing, all manner of topics and fancy covers yelling for attention. Ever the intrepid media reporter, I looked up from scanning Bon Appétit to see what other people were interested in. A mother and a daughter were locked in conversation, but everyone else was busy reading -- their phones.

HEADLINE: Both Sides Focus On The New Face

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MICHAEL BARBARO; Jodi Kantor contributed reporting from Chicago.

 BODY:
WAUKESHA, Wis. -- Democrats moved aggressively on Sunday to wrap Mitt Romney in the politically charged details of budget-cutting proposals championed by his new running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, as Mr. Romney sought to capitalize on conservative enthusiasm for his choice without having to defend every element of Mr. Ryan's positions.In North Carolina and at an evening rally in Wisconsin, Mr. Romney praised his running mate for conservative vision and courage. But with Mr. Ryan's introduction to a national audience defined by his plan to reshape Medicare and slash spending for nearly all government programs outside the military -- policies that Democrats have spent years using to generate opposition to Republicans -- campaign aides pointedly noted that it was a Romney-Ryan ticket, not Ryan-Romney.
''I have my budget plan,'' Mr. Romney said on CBS's ''60 Minutes.'' ''And that's the budget plan we're going to run on.'' 
The Republican team spent more time introducing each other to voters, smiling for pictures and sitting for their first joint television interview than they did delving into detailed policy proposals. Mr. Romney sought to get ahead of Democratic criticism by framing one of the more controversial elements of Mr. Ryan's approach as an effort ''to make sure we can save Medicare.''
But with some conservatives watching to see if Mr. Romney sticks by the ideas that have made Mr. Ryan a hero on the right, Democrats were intent on making Mr. Romney own every element of Mr. Ryan's record. They are not limiting their attacks to fiscal matters, but also highlighting Mr. Ryan's opposition to abortion rights and federal financing of contraception, issues the White House thinks could turn more women away from the Republican ticket.
President Obama, on a fund-raising visit to Chicago, welcomed Mr. Ryan to the race by describing him as the ''ideological leader'' of Republicans. His advisers worked to prepare a new advertising campaign to define the agenda advocated by Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan as a threat to women, retirees and others. At the same time, they sought to pressure Mr. Romney to embrace or distance himself from Mr. Ryan's plans.
''I assume Governor Romney embraces his thinking, since he's invested so much in talking about Ryan's role as the intellectual leader of the Republican Party,'' David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the Obama campaign, said in an interview. ''If he starts to distance himself from Ryan on positions that excite their base, I'm sure he'll have problems.''
The Republican candidates accused the Obama campaign of having nothing positive to say and trying to change the subject from the administration's economic record. But in their ''60 Minutes'' interview, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan said that they had no intention of changing health coverage for seniors who are receiving Medicare benefits.
The debate over the future of Medicare has been reawakened by the selection of Mr. Ryan, who has advocated overhauling the program by creating a ''premium support'' system that would give future retirees the option of receiving a specified amount of money to buy private coverage, a change that independent analysts say could leave beneficiaries with higher costs, less coverage or both. Mr. Romney has indicated that he generally agrees with that approach.
''Governor Romney is at the top of the ticket,'' Kevin Madden, a senior Romney adviser, said Sunday, seeking to make clear that his decisions would drive the policy debate. ''Governor Romney's vision for the country is something that Congressman Ryan supports.''
The choice of Mr. Ryan was intended by Mr. Romney and his aides to change the trajectory of the race after months of attacks from the White House and pressure from conservatives to raise the stakes of the campaign by embracing a bolder agenda for reducing the size and the role of government.
As the pair appeared before enthusiastic crowds on their second day together, Mr. Romney presented Mr. Ryan as a bipartisan conciliator in Washington and a man with ideas who works with Democrats on problems. It is at odds with how Democrats in Congress describe Mr. Ryan, whom they like personally but whose views they characterize as extreme.
But in the interview on ''60 Minutes,'' Mr. Ryan, 42, introduced himself as a patriot committed to turning around the country's fiscal challenges. ''We've dedicated much of our lives to saving this country,'' Mr. Ryan said when asked about bursting onto the national stage.
When he arrived at a homecoming rally here on Sunday evening, Mr. Ryan wiped away tears as he took the stage and looked out upon a sea of familiar faces in the crowd. ''Hi, Mom,'' he said, choking up as he pointed to friends and neighbors who hailed him as a proud son of Wisconsin.
Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican who survived a divisive recall election in June in a fight over collective bargaining that has made him into something of a conservative icon, said Sunday that members of his party should not be worried if Mr. Romney does not fully embrace every aspect of Mr. Ryan's budget, which has become a centerpiece of the party's fiscal agenda.
''Mitt Romney will have his own plan, but he values someone who has the courage to take on the tough issues,'' Mr. Walker said in an interview. ''With Paul on the ticket, you have the credibility of knowing that Paul Ryan is not going to be a wallflower. He is going to be an active part of a Romney administration.''
The debate over Medicare was an undercurrent at the Republican rallies on Sunday. It remains an open question whether attitudes are changing about the tough-medicine approach advocated by Mr. Ryan for a program that is on a trajectory of ultimate insolvency. Several older voters said they supported Mr. Ryan's plans to overhaul the program and would be disheartened if Mr. Romney backed away from them.
''I'd be disappointed,'' said Chuck Bino, 71, who added that Mr. Ryan's bold thinking on such issues is what convinced him Mr. Romney was not the ''middle-of-the-road candidate'' he feared.
While Medicare is a renewed focal point of the campaign, Democrats are digging into the Republican budget to highlight the implications for people across demographic groups, including proposed cuts to veterans' programs, student loans and regional programs. For the next three months, a debate that has largely taken place in Washington will be elevated to a national audience.
The addition of Mr. Ryan to the ticket has not redirected the focus of the campaign, Democratic strategists said, since Mr. Romney had already endorsed most of the provisions of the Republican budget. But they say it has intensified the budget debate and shined more light on all of the provisions of Mr. Ryan's plan.
Democrats on Sunday also seized on how Mr. Romney asked his prospective running mates to be more forthcoming in their tax information than the two years of returns that he has agreed to release. Mr. Ryan released several years of tax information to the campaign during his vetting, but like Mr. Romney he will publicly release only two years of returns.
But the thunderous reception the Republican ticket received at an evening rally in Wisconsin, with thousands of people filling an outdoor park in here in Waukesha, west of Milwaukee, capped a weekend where Mr. Romney saw the biggest and most enthusiastic crowds of his candidacy. After two days of joint campaigning, the men will go their own ways, with Mr. Ryan heading to Iowa and Mr. Romney traveling to Florida.
As Republicans head to their convention at the end of the month, a theme has emerged that advisers to Mr. Romney said underscored how the script had been flipped. A vote for Mr. Obama is an endorsement of the status quo, Republicans will argue, while a vote for Mr. Romney is a call for change.

HEADLINE: Tea Party Hopes to Gain Larger Stage in Election With Romney's Pick

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
For two years, Tea Party lawmakers in the House have been the stubborn barbarians at the gate, strong-arming their often reluctant Republican colleagues by refusing to compromise on spending, taxes, debt or social policy.But Representative Paul D. Ryan's ascendancy to the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket is a signal event for a movement that counts him as one of their own. If Mitt Romney wins in November, a Tea Party favorite will be a heartbeat from the Oval Office.
More than that, Mr. Ryan is now unquestionably the face of the Tea Party caucus in Washington, and his success is certain to embolden House lawmakers whose proudly unyielding approach to governance has contributed to legislative gridlock.Once considered a fringe of the conservative coalition, Tea Party lawmakers are now indisputably at the core of the modern Republican Party. 
"Governor Romney's selection of Congressman Paul Ryan is an excellent choice and a game changer for the presidential election," Representative Kevin Brady of Texas said in a statement. "It's now a campaign of ideas on how best to get this economy moving again, balance the budget and restore America."
He added: "My guess is that Barack Obama has a sick feeling in his stomach today."
For Mr. Romney, the choice has quickly helped to validate him in the eyes of skeptical Tea Party members in the House. Many in the movement had worried that a President Romney would hardly be an ally for their legislative goals.
Choosing Mr. Ryan eases those concerns even as it signals a shift in the movement's balance of power.
"Selecting someone like Paul Ryan, who is so popular with Tea Party activists, proves that Mitt Romney is committed to addressing the economic issues that have been troubling our nation for the last four years," Amy Kremer, the chairwoman of the Tea Party Express, the movement's largest political action committee, said in a statement.
Mr. Romney's emergence as the presumptive Republican nominee earlier this year raised questions about whether Tea Party supporters would find themselves marginalized in an election season dominated by the party's establishment.
In fact, the movement has expanded. Tea Party voters in Texas helped the Senate candidate Ted Cruz defeat David Dewhurst, the state's lieutenant governor. In Indiana, the Tea Party ousted the veteran Senator Richard G. Lugar. And in Wisconsin, activists helped Gov. Scott Walker survive his recall election.
At a Wisconsin Tea Party rally last month just before the recall, Mr. Ryan stood in solidarity with the movement as he urged its members to unite behind Mr. Walker. "The nucleus of our society, of our economy? It's not government. It's us. It's we the people. It's the individual," he said. "The whole country is watching."
Mr. Ryan, in his speech accepting the role of Mr. Romney's running mate, said he had reached across the aisle to find solutions that are workable to members of both parties.
"I have worked closely with Republicans as well as Democrats to advance an agenda of economic growth, fiscal discipline and job creation," Mr. Ryan said.
But his success may help to harden the political impasse in Washington between Democrats and Republicans, and between the House and the Senate. A huge postelection debate is looming over the fate of the Bush-era tax cuts and entitlement spending, issues on which Mr. Ryan has been urging Tea Party members to stand firm.
If Republicans win the White House in the fall but fail to take the Senate from the Democrats, Tea Party members in the House may see even less reason to compromise on their drive to make the federal government smaller.
"Congressman Ryan wants the same thing we do: to pass pro-growth policies and shrink the size and scope of government," said Chris Chocola, president of the Club for Growth, an anti-tax group. "No one understands the dire consequences we face by continuing to ignore our spending problem better than Congressman Ryan, and no one can do a better job of articulating a vision of how to fix it."
Within the Tea Party caucus, Mr. Ryan is not the most absolutist. He voted for the bailout of big banks known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, at the end of President George W. Bush's second term. And he voted for the bailout of the auto industry. Both actions are anathema to some Tea Party lawmakers. And in some ways, he is not the Tea Party archetype. A six-term congressman who has worked in Washington his entire career, Mr. Ryan is an insider-type politician who works from within the system, not against it.
But as chairman of the House Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan has resisted pressure from some in his party's leadership to compromise with the Obama administration in the interests of a grand bargain that many Tea Party members see as selling out.
And his far-reaching budget plans have attracted Tea Party support for the same reason that they have generated such fierce Democratic opposition: because they would go so far in reshaping the country's longstanding fiscal obligations.
President Obama's campaign released a 90-second video attacking Mr. Ryan on Saturday. The video uses an old clip of the newly minted vice-presidential candidate bragging that "I put out a very comprehensive plan rewriting the health care system, Medicare, Social Security, our entire tax system."
The Democrats intend that as an attack, but for Tea Party members it is a de facto mission statement.
Three years ago, the Tea Party movement emerged as a vehicle to protest Mr. Obama's health care legislation. Members followed up with a wave of political victories in the 2010 midterm elections that gave the movement a strong - if not always organized and coherent - voice in Congress.
Now, Mr. Ryan's place on the national ticket testifies to the staying power of the Tea Party ideology and provides a single person around which the movement can coalesce. When he delivers his remarks at the Republican National Convention in Tampa this month, Mr. Ryan will be speaking for the Tea Party as much as anyone else.
Tea Party activists are still likely to make some mischief at the convention, just as some of the movement's lawmakers in the House Republican caucus will no doubt find reasons to fault Mr. Ryan.
But every movement needs someone to help it focus. For the Tea Party, Mr. Ryan appears to be that man.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Schwarzenegger and University to Establish Policy Institute

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE

 BODY:
Schwarzenegger and U.S.C. announce policy instituteThe University of Southern California has announced the creation of the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy, named for the former governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
Mr. Schwarzenegger will head the institute's board of advisers. Other members of the board include Henry G. Cisneros, a former San Antonio mayor who was housing secretary in the Bill Clinton administration; Vicente Fox, a former Mexican president; and George P. Shultz, a former secretary of state.
The institute will focus on the responsibility of leaders to transcend partisanship, with a focus on education, energy and environment, fiscal and economic policy, health and human wellness and political reform.
Mr. Schwarzenegger will also hold the Governor Downey Professor of State and Global Policy chair, named after John G. Downey, the only other immigrant elected governor of California.
''From the time we immigrated here we always thought about what can we do for the state of California,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said in a video promoting the institute.
The institute plans to hold its first public event in September. -- CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE
Michigan State to offer postgraduate law in Dubai
The first English language postgraduate law programs in the Gulf region will be offered by Michigan State University at its Dubai campus in September 2012.
Local professionals in Dubai, in particular those working in multinational companies based in the United Arab Emirates, will learn more about the U.S. legal system and international legal issues. Students with or without a prior knowledge of law can apply to the master of laws and master of jurisprudence programs.
''We have witnessed a growing interest from students across the Middle East in M.S.U.'s law programs in the U.S.,'' Michael Lawrence, associate dean for graduate and international programs at M.S.U.'s Law College, said in a statement last month.
Students applying for the programs will be from around the world, but U.S. students are not expected to enroll, Mr. Lawrence was quoted as saying in The State News, the university's student-run daily newspaper. -- ZAKIYYAH WAHAB
Australian grant program focuses on global education
The Tony Adams Fund of Australia is offering its first financial grants for individuals from around the world who are working in the field of international education.
The grants are aimed at professional development and research in international education. Grants of up to 3,000 Australian dollars, or about $3,170, will be available for research projects, while individual grants for professional development will have a maximum of 1,500 Australian dollars.
''The main objective is to support people involved in international education, wherever they are from,'' Stephen Connelly, president of the International Education Association of Australia, said in an e-mail. He said he expected the grants to become popular once recipients share their experiences.
The fund was established last year in memory of the I.E.A.A.'s founding president, Tony Adams. The application period ends on Aug. 31. -- ZAKIYYAH WAHAB

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan's Role Model Was Jack Kemp

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Mitt Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, is a self-styled disciple of the late Jack Kemp, the buoyant conservative Republican who played a major role in shaping the political agenda in the last quarter of the 20th century.The relationship was real. Mr. Ryan worked for Mr. Kemp as a speechwriter and at his research organization; Mr. Kemp's granddaughter was an intern in his protégé's congressional office.
Like his mentor, Mr. Ryan is passionate, exuberant, intellectually stimulating and lacks the reputation for petty meanness that afflicts conservatives like Newt Gingrich (and some liberals, too). 
Cutting marginal tax rates to create an entrepreneurial society of opportunity is as central to Mr. Ryan's philosophy as it was to Mr. Kemp's.
Although they were more than a generation apart in age, there were personal similarities. Both are family men and outdoorsmen: Mr. Kemp was a skier; Mr. Ryan is a hunter and fisherman. Both loved professional football, Mr. Kemp as a star quarterback, Mr. Ryan as an avid fan of the Green Bay Packers.
The differences between them are equally interesting and instructive.
Mr. Kemp, for all his talent and charm, could be maddeningly undisciplined. This trait surfaced when he was the Republican vice-presidential candidate in 1996, much to the consternation of the man who picked him, Bob Dole.
That's not a worry for Mr. Romney. His 42-year-old running mate is disciplined, careful and always prepared. There is little danger of Mr. Ryan getting distracted or going off message in his debate with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
At the same time, Mr. Ryan lacks his mentor's inclusiveness and empathy. Mr. Kemp was at home in the barrio or the ghetto, where he sought to share his entrepreneurial American dream. That isn't Mr. Ryan's world. Black or Latino leaders would have been in Mr. Kemp's Rolodex and on a first-name basis with the ex-congressman and secretary of Housing and Urban Development. With Mr. Ryan, these constituencies have a correct and distant relationship.
Until he died in 2009, Mr. Kemp was a committed champion for more immigration, which he believed was at the center of the American experience; and he advocated a pathway to citizenship for those in the United States illegally. Mr. Ryan equivocates, even if his views may not be that different. He ends up between Mr. Kemp and Mr. Romney, who turned into an immigration-basher in the 2008 and 2012 presidential primaries.
In sync on taxes, their views on spending and the role of government were different. Mr. Kemp came to Congress more than 40 years ago as a traditional small-government Republican; he evolved into a supply-sider who didn't really want to slash government and proudly declared that he didn't ''worship at the shrine of the balanced budget.''
Mr. Kemp was one of the few members to serve on a congressional budget committee whose outlook wasn't captured by that experience. That transcends party: The current chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, the Democrat Kent Conrad of North Dakota, is a genuine deficit hawk.
As the current chairman of the House Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan is defined by his blueprint. Rarely has one House member so dominated an issue. His budget includes huge tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy and massive budget cutbacks to shrink the size of government.
With his intellectual prowess and personal appeal, Mr. Ryan is comfortable with elites. That includes some people who don't share his views, though he doesn't work the other side of the political aisle as well as Mr. Kemp did.
It will be revealing, and a mistake, if Mr. Romney tries to strike some distance from the Ryan budget. By picking the Wisconsin lawmaker, the presidential candidate is joined at the political hip to that proposal.
Yet the man and his plan aren't as simple as depicted by allies and adversaries. Mr. Ryan is a supply-side tax cutter; unlike Mr. Kemp, he also wants to radically transform and reduce the role of government. Even his revised budget plan, with less draconian Medicare cuts, almost surely would involve significant cutbacks in benefits. And the Medicaid cuts would fall hard on the poor and those with disabilities. Mr. Ryan believes this would produce a more vibrant economy and ultimately help the less fortunate.
He's not, however, a huge deficit hawk; in that sense, like Mr. Kemp, he doesn't worship at the altar of a balanced budget. The Ryan plan would take three decades to balance the budget; Mr. Romney promises to do it in a decade.
More than President Barack Obama, Mr. Ryan was the politician who killed the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson deficit-reduction proposal. He was on the panel that recommended narrowing the deficit by $4 trillion, primarily through spending cuts, but also higher taxes. Unlike some other conservatives on the committee, such as Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Mr. Ryan voted against Bowles-Simpson; if he had voted for it, the proposal might have come to a vote in Congress.
Don't be surprised if Mr. Ryan is attacked by some Democrats as a deficit dove. Mr. Kemp would have worn that as a badge of honor; his disciple probably won't.

HEADLINE: The Romney Package

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER. 
Paul Krugman is off today.

 BODY:
BRACE yourself for weeks of chatter about Mitt Romney's running mate. Vice presidents matter, as we have been spookily reminded by the recent re-emergence of Dick Cheney on our TV screens. And Paul Ryan matters more than most. (See below.)But these days you don't just elect a ticket of two; you elect a whole package. Presidents come with a cast of advisers, think tanks, lobbyists, legislators, donors and watchdogs. Some in the entourage end up in key jobs; others operate as a kind of shadow cabinet, vetting choices and enforcing doctrine.
This is especially true of Republicans, who have spent decades building a disciplined conservative infrastructure that recruits talent, culls dissenters and lays down the law. Compared with Democrats, who are scattered left and center, a Republican administration is more than ever a conservative turnkey project.
As governor of Massachusetts, Romney gathered a team of technocrats, centrist Republicans, even some Democrats. ''He sought competence, experience and creativity and gave less weight to politics or ideology,'' recalled Scott Helman, a veteran Romney-watcher for The Boston Globe. ''But that was then,'' he added. Yes, that was a different time, a different place, a different Romney. 
It's possible President Romney would prefer to convene an administration of deal-cutters and problem-solvers. The trusted aides expected to help him organize the West Wing -- former Senator Jim Talent of Missouri; Mike Leavitt, former governor of Utah; former Bain Capital partner Bob White; and Beth Myers, who was Romney's chief of staff in Massachusetts -- are more managers than firebrands.
The question is whether anything short of hyperpartisanship is possible for a Republican leader in today's Washington. At the national level, moderate Republicans are scarce and endangered. The policy factories, Congressional stalwarts and interest groups Romney will need to staff a government have been ideologically purified and politically schooled, and are mostly conservatives of the uncompromising kind. President Romney will be as much a captive of this Republican Washington as its leader. Ask John Boehner.
What follows is a sampler of what you get with a President Romney, some of them his choices, some thrust upon him. The primary campaign pulled Romney sharply to the right. Here are some of the forces that are likely to keep him there.
THE APOSTLE OF MARKETS Ryan would have been a powerful voice in a Romney administration even if he had not been chosen for the sidekick role -- the younger, quicker, more conviction-filled half of the ticket. His manifesto for lower tax rates and severe cuts in nonmilitary spending has become his party's master plan, a brutal alternative to the recommendations of the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles fiscal reform commission (which Ryan participated in, then voted against because it included tax hikes). Ryan gets demonized as a guy who wants to privatize the safety net, and not without reason. President Obama decried Ryan's plan for Medicare vouchers as ''social Darwinism''; even Newt Gingrich called it ''right-wing social engineering.'' Ryan has tempered some of the more radical aspects of his plan, and the other day he told me he regards it as the basis of a bipartisan ''adult conversation,'' not the last word. (Ryan is, like Obama, the kind of self-confident politician who will call a critical columnist if he sees a scrap of common ground.) ''We have consensus within both parties and in the country that health security is a mission of the federal government,'' he said in a phone call from Wisconsin. But make no mistake, Ryan embodies a philosophy that most public needs -- even such sensitive needs as health care and retirement security -- are better served with a lot less government and a lot more trust in the dubious mercies of the marketplace.
THE HAWK On foreign policy, Romney has so far largely bypassed his party's mainstream in favor of advisers with a decidedly neoconservative bent -- confrontational, unilateral, with a missionary urge to spread American-style democracy and a particular affinity for Israel's hard-liners. Romney's more conventional insiders call it the ''Bolton faction,'' for John Bolton, among the most hawkish of George W. Bush's ''freedom agenda'' interventionists. Bolton is now on the Romney team, but Dan Senor is the one who has Romney's ear. At 40, he is next-gen Bolton, smoother, TV-savvy, post-cold war in age but cold war in spirit. (He co-founded a think tank with the Soviet-era neocon William Kristol.) Senor helped choreograph Romney's recent foreign debut, in which the candidate needlessly offended the British and the Palestinians. You might think that gaffe-a-thon would be a career setback, but Senor has survived bigger debacles. He was the spin-doctor for L. Paul Bremer, who, as the American proconsul of post-conquest Iraq, presided over the most highhanded and blundering stage of the occupation.
THE ORIGINALIST Appointing 85-year-old Robert Bork as co-chairman of his Justice Advisory Committee sent a clear message to the right: The Supreme Court will be all yours. Bork is the original originalist, champion of the doctrine that says the Constitution does not adapt to changes in society, spiritual father of Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. A Reagan Supreme Court nominee, he was attacked (with justification) as a radical and denied confirmation; to conservatives he is a martyr and an oracle. Temperamentally, Romney might be tempted to nominate someone in the slightly less doctrinaire mold of Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. But to the hard core, Roberts is tarnished by his ruling in support of Obama's health care plan. As my friend the expert court-watcher Linda Greenhouse puts it, ''I think we can assume without fear of being tendentious that Romney would go as far to the right as the base wants and the Senate would permit.''
THE TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMIST R. Glenn Hubbard, who has been a top Romney adviser since the 2008 campaign, is a reputable economist, dean of Columbia Business School. He is not one of those abolish-the-Fed, tax-cuts-pay-for-themselves charlatans who seem to have captured the minds of so many Republicans. But he has increasingly traded in his economic science for partisan politics. As chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, Hubbard rationalized huge tax cuts (the promised bonanza of jobs failed to materialize) and deregulation (widely blamed for contributing to the housing and banking mess). Now he lends an expert gloss to the claim that Romney's sketchy economic plan will create 12 million jobs -- a claim I doubt would pass muster in a first-year Econ class at Columbia.
THE MOGUL CHORUS The traditional euphemism in Washington is that money doesn't buy influence; it just buys access. Whatever you call it, Romney's mega-donors, who have their individual pet issues and a shared loathing of regulations of any kind, will not be settling for sleepovers in the Lincoln Bedroom. Sheldon Adelson (casinos and Israel), Charles and David Koch (petroleum and libertarian politics) and Bob Perry (home builder and bankroller of the Swift Boat slander) will not be taking cabinet jobs. But don't expect to see a secretary of commerce or energy or a director of the Environmental Protection Agency (if any of those positions still exist) or any other key regulator who does not pass muster with Romney's big investors, or does not take their phone calls.
THE TEAM OF RIVALS Just as Obama recruited Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden into his administration, a victorious Romney would reach out to Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Herman Cain ... just kidding! Santorum does have a speaking slot at the convention, and he needs a job (secretary of health and human services would be a horrifying sop to social conservatives), but the Republican also-rans are most likely to play the role of visible and ornery watchdogs. I expect their only personal contact with President Romney would be in the green room at Fox News.

HEADLINE: The Romney-Ryan Plan for America

 BODY:
Less than 24 hours after Mitt Romney chose Paul Ryan as his running mate on Saturday, his campaign was already trying to distance itself from Mr. Ryan's politically toxic budget plan. His budget is not ours, the campaign said; Mr. Romney ''will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance.''It's no wonder that Mr. Romney does not want to take full responsibility for his running mate's ideas. Mr. Romney hasn't issued a real budget plan and appears to have no interest in doing so before the election, perhaps for fear that voters might realize how little they would like it. Mr. Ryan, on the other hand, has assembled two spending plans, both of which were passed by the House. While the country is fortunate they were never enacted, they reveal Republican priorities in a way that Mr. Romney up to now has avoided.
Most voters know little about Mr. Ryan. Those who have heard of him are probably most familiar with his Medicare plan, which would turn the program into a voucher system that would pay beneficiaries a fixed amount for their medical care, leaving them on their own if the voucher did not cover their costs. 
This notion so alarmed the public last year that Mr. Ryan was forced to backtrack and leave the existing Medicare system as an option. Even so, the plan would leave older Americans on average with $6,400 in extra costs by 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Even less familiar to voters are Mr. Ryan's plans for the rest of the federal budget, which if anything are worse than his Medicare proposal. By cutting $6 trillion from federal spending over the next 10 years, he would eliminate or slash so many programs that the federal government would be unrecognizable. That has long been a goal of the Tea Party ideologues who support Mr. Ryan fervently, but it is not one shared by anywhere near a majority of Americans.
As House Budget Committee chairman, Mr. Ryan drew a blueprint for a government that would be absent when people needed it the most. Medicaid, food stamps, and other vital programs would be offloaded to the states, but the states would not be given the resources to run them. The federal government simply would not be there to help the unemployed who need job training, or struggling students who seek college educations. Washington would be unable to respond when a city cannot properly treat its sewage, or when the poor and uninsured overload emergency rooms as clinics close.
More than three-fifths of the cuts proposed by Mr. Ryan come from programs for low-income Americans. These cuts are so severe that the nation's Catholic bishops protested the proposal as failing to meet society's moral obligations, saying the plans ''will hurt hungry children, poor families, vulnerable seniors.''
To Mr. Ryan, the poor will benefit when they no longer rely on government handouts. But his plans contain no pathway to self-reliance for the tens of millions of people who are either poor, unemployed or uninsured. In his world, they will be entirely on their own, or will rely on charity.
He certainly can't pretend to turn around the economy by eliminating the deficit. Mr. Ryan's budget would not reach a surplus for 30 years, according to the C.B.O., because he would cut taxes, largely for the rich and for corporations, by $4 trillion. That's even more than Mr. Romney's extravagant tax giveaways, because Mr. Ryan would erase all capital gains taxes. Since investments are the principal income generators for Mr. Romney and millions of other high earners, Mr. Romney made the more prudent choice to cut capital gains taxes only for the middle class.
There may be other differences between the two men on the Republican ticket, but Mr. Romney's deliberate obfuscations of his plans will make them difficult to discern. Up to now, for example, their Medicare plans have been identical, but Mr. Romney has also said he would issue his own Medicare plan at some point this fall, keeping voters in the dark.
Whatever his political considerations were, Mr. Romney made a clear statement in choosing the most extreme of the vice-presidential possibilities, both in Mr. Ryan's economic views and his positions on social issues, like his opposition to contraception coverage under the health care reform law for employees of religiously affiliated institutions, repeal of the military's don't ask, don't tell policy, and sensible gun control. More than any small differences that eventually develop between the men, it is their shared and troubling goals that bind them together.

HEADLINE: Motorola Set For Big Cuts As Google Reinvents It

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER; Brian X. Chen contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Motorola Mobility, the ailing cellphone maker that Google bought in May, told employees Sunday that it would lay off 20 percent of its work force and close a third of its 94 offices worldwide.The cuts are the first step in Google's plan to reinvent Motorola, which has fallen far behind its biggest competitors, Apple and Samsung, and to shore up its Android mobile business and expand beyond search and software into the manufacture of hardware.
The turnaround effort will also be a referendum on the management of Larry Page, Google's chief executive, whose boldest move has been the $12.5 billion acquisition.
Though Google bought Motorola partly because of its more than 17,000 patents, which can help defend against challenges to the Android operating system, it also planned to use Motorola to make its own, better smartphones and tablets. 
One-third of the 4,000 jobs lost will be in the United States. The company plans to leave unprofitable markets, stop making low-end devices and focus on a few cellphones instead of dozens, said Dennis Woodside, Motorola's new chief executive, in a rare interview.
''We're excited about the smartphone business,'' said Mr. Woodside, who previously led Google's sales and operations for the Americas. ''The Google business is built on a wired model, and as the world moves to a pretty much completely wireless model over time, it's really going to be important for Google to understand everything about the mobile consumer.''
But some analysts wonder whether Google can succeed in the brutally competitive, low-margin cellphone business.
''Ninety percent of the profits in the smartphone space are going to Apple and Samsung, and everyone else from Motorola to RIM to LG to Nokia are picking up the scraps of that 10 percent,'' said Charlie Kindel, a former manager at Microsoft who writes about the mobile industry. ''There's no real sign that's changing anytime soon.''
It was not always this way. Motorola executives like to talk about its glory days. The company, started in 1928 in Chicago, unveiled the first commercial cellphone in 1973. By 2004, it looked as if Motorola could again lead the cellphone industry when it introduced the popular Razr.
But Apple and Samsung won consumers' hearts with the more exciting iPhone and Galaxy phones. Motorola Mobility -- which split last year from Motorola Solutions, the division that makes devices like police radios -- lost $233 million in its first six weeks under Google. The phone business has been unprofitable for 14 of the last 16 quarters.
''It got left in the dust by the competition and kind of missed the smartphone transition,'' said Charles S. Golvin, a mobile analyst at Forrester Research.
In addition to the coming cuts, Google has gutted Motorola management, letting go 40 percent of its vice presidents. It also hired new senior executives. It will shrink operations in Asia and India, and center research and development in Chicago, Sunnyvale and Beijing.
Mr. Woodside also plans to cut the number of devices Motorola makes from the 27 it introduced last year to just a few. He wants to make the company's products cool again by loading them with things like sensors that recognize who is in a room based on their voices, cameras that take crisper photos and batteries that last for days.
Many of these new ideas will come from a group of just a few dozen people within the company that has the unassuming name of Advanced Technology and Projects.
To foster innovation, Google created the group to drop a Silicon Valley-style start-up into a lumbering Midwestern company and recruited Regina Dugan from the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or Darpa, to run it.
Ms. Dugan, though coming from Washington, already speaks the language of Silicon Valley. ''It's a small, lean and agile group that is unafraid of failure,'' she said, and it will ''celebrate impatience.''
She is hiring metal scientists, acoustics engineers and artificial intelligence experts. They will work for her for only two years so they feel a sense of urgency, she said, an idea she borrowed from Darpa, where people wear their resignation date on their name tags.
Motorola has been spending too much money on too many different cellphone components, said Mark Randall, whom Google recruited to run Motorola's supply chain from Amazon.com, where he did that for the Kindle. He said he planned to jettison suppliers and buy 50 percent fewer components.
How to get people excited about Motorola phones when shiny iPhones are on the next shelf?
Gary Briggs, who ran consumer marketing at Google and now does so at Motorola, is working on advertisements that he said would be more like Google's -- simple and emotional. They will focus on Motorola's storied past and the ways the products are better than the competition's, like battery life.
''We have a right to compete in this market,'' Mr. Briggs said, ''and I think we've got to prove why we're going to build and bring devices to people that are worth talking about again.''
Competitors like Sony, LG and HTC will be watching closely to see how the Motorola-Google relationship develops, especially whether Motorola receives special treatment from Google. Like Motorola, they use the Android mobile operating system, for which Google receives no payment.
''They certainly don't believe Google's going to keep a Chinese wall in place,'' Mr. Kindel, the former Microsoft manager, said of the other cellphone makers. ''The reality is people work together, they can pick up the phones and talk. There is going to be an advantage.''
There is, for instance, a program for Google software engineers to work at Motorola for a year or two.
But Mr. Woodside said Google benefited from many manufacturers' using Android, and repeated Google's promise that Motorola would have no advantages. He said Motorola would also compete equally with others to build Google-branded Nexus devices, which Google makes with a hardware partner when it introduces new versions of Android.
A Motorola Mobility executive who recently left the company and would speak only on the condition of anonymity because he was uncomfortable talking to the news media, said that if anything, it had become more difficult than before for Motorola to have impromptu collaboration with the Android team.
But still, because of the relationship, Motorola could get priority on Google products, like a mobile version of desktop software.
And, people familiar with the companies say, Google could decide to follow Apple's lead and build a phone from silicon to software, perhaps by creating a separate operating system for Motorola that other phone makers cannot use.
Google and Motorola seem to have a mutually beneficial marriage of hardware and software, Mr. Golvin said. Motorola needs software smarts and Google, which has struggled with Chrome laptops, Google TV and most recently the Nexus Q, needs help with hardware. Motorola's set-top boxes, which it sells to cable operators, could also help Google make the leap to TV screens, if it does not sell that business.
In the meantime, Motorola's cellphone expertise has already been useful. Sergey Brin, Google's co-founder, called to see whether the sky divers he had hired to perform at a recent conference could get cell reception a mile in the sky.

HEADLINE: With a History of Sparring, Obama and Ryan Are Ready for a Showdown

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
When President Obama was first elected, aides say, he saw Representative Paul D. Ryan, another ambitious Midwestern policy wonk, as someone he could possibly work with to reverse the building federal debt.He soon would change his view, as he made plain on Sunday in welcoming Mr. Ryan to the race as Mitt Romney's running mate. ''The ideological leader of Republicans in Congress,'' Mr. Obama called him, affixing a label clearly not meant as praise, and an advocate of the same ''top down'' economics as Mr. Romney.
''I know him, I welcome him to the race,'' Mr. Obama said at a Chicago fund-raiser. ''He is a decent man. He is a family man. He is an articulate spokesman for Governor Romney's vision. But it is a vision that I fundamentally disagree with.''
For his part, Mr. Ryan does not think much of the president's ideas either. 
''He has put all of his policies in place, and they're just not working,'' Mr. Ryan told a partisan crowd in Manassas, Va., on Saturday evening. ''Take a look at the results. We've got the worst recovery in 70 years.''
The president and Mr. Ryan, who will both campaign in Iowa on Monday, know each other well. For nearly four years, they have been leading antagonists in an increasingly rancorous debate over the size and scope of government, one forced by projections of unsustainable and mounting debt as the population ages and health care costs keep rising.
And while it is not uncommon for a presidential candidate to know his rival's No. 2 better than he knows the rival -- think Al Gore and Dick Cheney, former House colleagues, in 2000; or George Bush and Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen, two Texans, in 1988 -- the history between Mr. Obama and Mr. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, makes for an especially intriguing showdown.
The early failure of any partnership to take hold between Mr. Obama and Mr. Ryan reflects the broader failure of the president's promise, the core of his 2008 campaign, to bridge the chasm between Democrats and Republicans in Washington. The switch in Mr. Obama's approach to Mr. Ryan over time -- from conciliatory outreach to aggressive pushback -- mirrors his changed relations with Republicans in general.
The two men, for all their policy differences, have some similarities. Both are young -- Mr. Obama just turned 51, Mr. Ryan is 42. Both are intelligent and policy oriented. Each is sure of himself and of the rightness of his views, though Mr. Obama is widely seen as more pragmatic while Mr. Ryan is proudly, conservatively ideological. And both are men in a hurry. Mr. Obama reached for the presidency just two years into his first Senate term, and Mr. Ryan is widely viewed -- including by Mr. Obama, aides say -- as someone with presidential ambitions.
In Mr. Obama's first year of managing the financial crisis and the recession he had inherited, he and Mr. Ryan had little contact. Republicans then were the minority in the House, and Mr. Ryan had no committee chairmanship from which to push his ''road map'' plan for deep tax cuts, an overhaul of federal entitlement programs and other changes he sees as essential to restoring the nation's economic strength.
But by the start of 2010, as the economy showed signs -- false ones, it turned out -- of a strong recovery and Mr. Obama began thinking beyond short-term economic stimulus measures to reducing long-term annual budget deficits, he reached out to Mr. Ryan.
In January, the president joined House Republicans at their annual retreat and pointedly referred to Mr. Ryan.
''I think Paul, for example, head of the Budget Committee, has looked at the budget and has made a serious proposal,'' Mr. Obama said.
''I've read it,'' he said. ''I can tell you what's in it. And there are some ideas in there that I would agree with, but there are some ideas that we should have a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them.''
Calling spending for Medicare, Medicaid and other public health programs ''the major driver of our long-term liabilities, everybody here knows,'' Mr. Obama said Mr. Ryan had ''an entirely legitimate proposal'' in his idea to transform Medicare into a voucherlike system that would pay current beneficiaries a capped amount to buy private insurance.
Mr. Ryan interjected that his proposed Medicare changes would not apply to people currently receiving benefits or to those within a decade of doing so. Mr. Obama continued, saying the problem with the plan was that the payments would not keep up with the rise in health care costs. At the close, the men shook hands and the president signed an autograph for Mr. Ryan's young daughter.
Earlier in that session, Mr. Obama had also singled out Mr. Ryan to make a point less about policy than about politics in Washington.
''The problem we have sometimes is a media that responds only to slash-and-burn-style politics,'' Mr. Obama said. ''You don't get a lot of credit if I say, 'You know, I think Paul Ryan's a pretty sincere guy and has a beautiful family.' Nobody's going to run that in the newspapers, right?''
Mindful that some Republicans were threatened by intraparty rivals for being seen as too friendly toward him, Mr. Obama added to his antagonists' laughter. ''And by the way,'' he said, ''in case he's going to get a Republican challenge, I didn't mean it.'' Looking directly at Mr. Ryan, he said, ''I don't want to -- don't want to hurt you, man.''
A year later, Republicans had taken control of the House, and Mr. Ryan the Budget Committee, after a midterm campaign in which they attacked Mr. Obama, accusing him of cutting Medicare by $500 billion over 10 years in his health care law -- reductions that were the same as in the Ryan plan, which he now was shepherding to House passage.
In April last year, days before the House vote on Mr. Ryan's budget, Mr. Obama outlined his deficit-reduction plan for spending cuts and revenue increases roughly along the lines of recommendations from a majority of members on his Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission from the previous December that Mr. Ryan, a commission member, opposed.
Not knowing that Mr. Ryan was in the front row, though he had been invited by White House staff, Mr. Obama flayed the Ryan budget. Mr. Ryan, in an interview, said he afterward told Obama economic adviser Gene Sperling that the president had ''poisoned the well.''
Soon after, when Mr. Obama called House Republicans to the White House to start budget talks, Mr. Ryan challenged him to stop the political attacks. Mr. Obama countered that Republicans were no slouches at attacks, even of his birthplace.
''Paul stood up and was not bashful in that setting,'' said Representative Jason Chaffetz, Republican of Utah. ''When you are confident in your understanding of the material, there is no reason he shouldn't get up and challenge the notions of the president.''

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan's Journey

 BODY:
Some of the milestones in Representative Paul D. Ryan's life and career.1986 His family credited the shock of his father's death before the age of 60 with setting the 16-year-old Mr. Ryan off on a quest for intellectual development and accomplishment. He read voraciously, joined numerous scholastic clubs and was elected class president. 
1988-92 Mr. Ryan used Social Security survivors' benefits he received after the death of his father to help pay for his education at Miami University in Ohio. He arrived at college already steeped in the philosophies of the conservative economist Friedrich August von Hayek, and became a protegé of William R. Hart, a libertarian economist and follower of Milton Friedman.
1992 Mr. Ryan became an aide to Senator Robert Kasten of Wisconsin, a supply-side advocate.
1993 After Mr. Kasten's defeat, Mr. Ryan went to work as a speechwriter for Jack Kemp, the 1996 Republican vicepresidential nominee, who became ''like a second father,'' according to friends.
1998 After working briefly in the family construction business in Janesville, Wis., Mr. Ryan was elected to Congress at age 28.
2003 Mr. Ryan gave copies of ''Atlas Shrugged'' by the libertarian Ayn Rand to his staff for Christmas. He had discovered her writings in high school and often cited her as an intellectual inspiration. Though he has recently disavowed her, in 2009 he said in an interview with Politico that conditions in America were equivalent to a novel by Rand, who ''did the best job of anybody to build a moral case of capitalism, and that morality of capitalism is under assault.''
2004 With help from Mr. Kemp and others, Mr. Ryan advocated a plan to privatize Social Security. In 2005, President George W. Bush pushed a similar idea, which was savaged by Democrats. Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives in 2006.
2010 Mr. Ryan proposed a ''Roadmap for America's Future,'' a plan to cut the deficit without raising taxes. A large part of the plan was to remake entitlements and cut spending on them. Many Republicans, who had just retaken control of the House of Representatives, were initially very cool to Mr. Ryan's proposal, but conservatives embraced it. Mr. Ryan became chairman of the House Budget Committee.
JANUARY 2011 Mr. Ryan delivered the Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union address. The House of Representatives voted in favor of Mr. Ryan's latest proposal to remake the government, called ''The Path to Prosperity.''
SUMMER 2011 Mr. Ryan was instrumental in scuttling an agreement to resolve an impasse between Republicans and Mr. Obama over raising the federal debt ceiling. The agreement included raising taxes and cutting spending.

HEADLINE: As Ryan Looks to Focus On Economy, Spotlight Shines on His Other Views

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Though best known as an architect of conservative fiscal policy, Representative Paul D. Ryan has also been an ardent, unwavering foe of abortion rights, has tried to cut off federal money for family planning, has opposed same-sex marriage and has championed the rights of gun owners.Despite those positions, Mr. Ryan, who was picked over the weekend to be Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate, has said he wants to focus on the nation's looming debt crisis, not on social issues, in the coming campaign.
Democrats, hoping to win a large majority of female voters in November, assailed Mr. Ryan's record on abortion rights and women's health on Sunday. 
In an interview with the conservative Weekly Standard in 2010, Mr. Ryan, an observant Roman Catholic, played down the possibility of a truce on social issues, which had been suggested by Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, a Republican.
''I'm as pro-life as a person gets,'' Mr. Ryan said then. ''You're not going to have a truce. Judges are going to come up. Issues come up, they're unavoidable, and I'm never going to not vote pro-life.''
In nearly 14 years as a Republican congressman from Wisconsin, Mr. Ryan has not only voted for legislation that would cut off federal money for Planned Parenthood and the Title X family planning program, but also backed bills to establish criminal penalties for certain doctors who perform the procedure known as partial-birth abortion.
He is a co-sponsor of a bill that would define fetuses as people entitled to full legal protection, a proposal that has become the latest focus in the battles over abortion. The bill declares, ''The life of each human being begins with fertilization, cloning, or its functional equivalent, irrespective of sex, health, function or disability, defect, stage of biological development, or condition of dependency, at which time every human being shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood.''
The concept of personhood is a fundamental tenet of the anti-abortion movement, and under this definition, abortion and some forms of birth control could be construed as murder.
Like most Republicans, Mr. Ryan has strenuously opposed the new health care law championed by President Obama. He has criticized Mr. Obama's efforts to guarantee free insurance coverage of contraceptives for women, including those employed by Roman Catholic hospitals, universities and social service agencies.
''The contraceptive mandate is an affront to religious liberty,'' Mr. Ryan has said.
''If the president is willing to trample on our constitutional rights in a difficult election year, imagine what he will do in implementing the rest of this law, after he doesn't have to face the voters again, if he gets re-elected,'' Mr. Ryan said in February on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
David Axelrod, a top strategist for the Obama campaign, described Mr. Ryan on Sunday as ''a right-wing ideologue.''
''Congressman Ryan would ban a woman's right to choose, even in cases of rape and incest,'' Mr. Axelrod said on CNN's ''State of the Union.'' ''So he is quite extreme. Good, good person, you know, genial person, but his views are quite harsh.''
Mr. Ryan, speaking on gay rights, has said, ''I believe fundamentally that marriage is between a man and a woman.''
He voted in 2006 for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. And, as he said recently, he supported an amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution, approved in 2006, that denies official recognition to same-sex marriage.
''Only a marriage between one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state,'' the amendment says. ''A legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals shall not be valid or recognized in this state.''
Mr. Ryan voted in 2009 against a bill that would expand federal hate crime laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation or gender identity.
Nevertheless, in a break with many members of his party, Mr. Ryan voted in 2007 for a bill that would prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.
R. Clarke Cooper of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, said, ''Congressman Ryan's vote in favor of the Employment Nondiscrimination Act and his consistent willingness to engage with Log Cabin on a range of issues speaks to his record as a fair-minded policy maker.''
An avid hunter, Mr. Ryan supports gun owners' rights and voted for legislation that would generally bar people from suing gun manufacturers for damages caused by misuse of their products.
Appearing on C-Span shortly after he was first elected to Congress in 1998, Mr. Ryan said, ''I do not think that more gun control laws are going to solve our crime problems.'' He added, ''Gun control is not crime control.''
Noting that he had lived on Capitol Hill, Mr. Ryan said: ''I've been mugged before. I've heard the gunshots. This city has perhaps the most stringent gun control laws in any city in the country. Yet it has perhaps the greatest crime problems with firearms.''
He voted in 1999 against a proposal that would have established much more stringent requirements for background checks on people buying firearms at gun shows. He voted last year for a gun-rights bill under which a permit to carry a concealed firearm in one state would be valid in almost every other state.
Mr. Ryan also voted last year for a bill stipulating that no federal money could be made available to NPR.
And he has supported a ban on flag burning, voting for a constitutional amendment empowering Congress to outlaw the practice.

HEADLINE: The One Housing Solution Left: Mass Mortgage Refinancing

BYLINE: By JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ and MARK ZANDI. 
Joseph E. Stiglitz is a professor of economics at Columbia. Mark Zandi is the chief economist at Moody's Analytics.

 BODY:
MORE than four million Americans have lost their homes since the housing bubble began bursting six years ago. An additional 3.5 million homeowners are in the foreclosure process or are so delinquent on payments that they will be soon. With 13.5 million homeowners underwater -- they owe more than their home is now worth -- the odds are high that many millions more will lose their homes.Housing remains the biggest impediment to economic recovery, yet Washington seems paralyzed. While the Obama administration's housing policies have fallen short, Mitt Romney hasn't offered any meaningful new proposals to aid distressed or underwater homeowners.
Late last month, the top regulator overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac blocked a plan backed by the Obama administration to let the companies forgive some of the mortgage debt owed by stressed homeowners. While half a million homeowners could be helped with a principal writedown, the regulator, Edward J. DeMarco, argued (we believe incorrectly) that helping some homeowners might cause others who are paying on their loans to stop so that they also could get their mortgages reduced. 
With principal writedown no longer an option, the government needs to find a new way to facilitate mass mortgage refinancings. With rates at record lows, refinancing would allow homeowners to significantly reduce their monthly payments, freeing up money to spend on other things. A mass refinancing program would work like a potent tax cut.
Refinancing would also significantly reduce the chance of default for underwater homeowners. With fewer losses from past loans burdening their balance sheets, lenders could make more new loans, and communities plagued by mass foreclosures might see relief from blight.
Well over half of all American homeowners with mortgages are paying rates that would appear to make them excellent candidates to refinance. Many of those with stable jobs, good credit scores and even a modest amount of home equity have already done so, taking out 30-year loans at rates around 3.5 percent, some of the lowest rates since the 1950s. But many others can't refinance because the collapse in house prices has wiped out their home equity.
Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat, has proposed a remedy. Under his plan, called Rebuilding American Homeownership, underwater homeowners who are current on their payments and meet other requirements would have the option to refinance to either lower their monthly payments or pay down their loans and rebuild equity.
A government-financed trust would be used to buy the mortgages of homeowners who had refinanced at an interest rate that was about 2 percentage points more than the record-low Treasury rates at which the government borrows. This would generate enough interest income to cover the costs of any defaults, administration of the trust and other expenses. Families would have three years to refinance; after that, the trust would stop buying loans and eventually wind itself down as homeowners repaid their loans.
Homeowners would see lower mortgage payments and rebuild equity more quickly. Taxpayers would get their money back, with interest, and would gain further as a stronger economy lifted tax revenues. Banks and other mortgage investors would get potentially troubled loans off their books. Some banks won't like losing the large amounts of interest income they are earning on their current mortgages, but if the refinancing market were working properly these loans would have been refinanced long ago.
If the program was very successful, we envisage that two million outstanding loans could be placed in a Rebuilding American Homeownership trust at its peak. If the average mortgage balance was $150,000, then at the peak there would be $300 billion outstanding.
The federal government could finance the plan directly, through the Federal Housing Administration, or indirectly, through the Federal Home Loan Banks, which offer government-backed credit. Or the Federal Reserve could underwrite the plan; the central bank's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, recently talked about the Fed's doing something akin to the Bank of England's new Funding for Lending program, which offers incentives to banks to increase lending to households and nonfinancial businesses.
Opponents of additional borrowing or Fed lending will say that a program like this is an unacceptable risk, but the greater risk is to do nothing and let the housing market continue to hold back the economy.
Mr. Merkley's plan resembles the Obama administration's Home Affordable Refinance Plan, or HARP, which was designed to help underwater homeowners refinance loans backed by Fannie and Freddie. It has made possible 1.4 million refinancings, far fewer than the goal set in 2009 of 3 million to 4 million. The administration has made some improvements to HARP and proposed others. But the Merkley plan has the potential to go further, reaching the 20 million households with mortgages that aren't backed by Fannie or Freddie.
The Merkley plan has a successful precedent in the Home Owners' Loan Corporation, established in 1933. It swept more than a million Americans out of foreclosure and into the long-term, stable mortgages that would become the hallmark of the middle class during the 1950s and '60s. It's time to revive this idea.
Since the Great Recession began almost five years ago, housing has been at the heart of our economic woes. If we do nothing, the problem will eventually resolve itself, but only with significant pain and a long wait. Mr. Merkley's plan would speed the healing.

HEADLINE: Conservative Star's Small-Town Roots

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER, JIM RUTENBERG, MIKE McINTIRE and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Jennifer Steinhauer reported from Janesville, Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington, and Jim Rutenberg and Mike McIntire from New York. Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting from New York, and Serge Kovaleski from Denver. Kitty Bennett contributed research from Seattle, and Sheelagh McNeill from New York.

 BODY:
JANESVILLE, Wis. -- Representative Paul D. Ryan's childhood home here was not overtly partisan. His parents were enthusiastic supporters of Representative Les Aspin, a Democrat, yet adored President Ronald Reagan from their glimpses of him on the evening news. But the death of his father when Mr. Ryan was only 16 punctured his life of math tests and bike riding, and in that fissure, the seeds of his worldview were planted.''Paul went to work at McDonald's and began to pull his own weight, and becomes class president the same year,'' said his brother Tobin. ''It is remarkable that he chose a path of individual responsibility and maturity rather than letting grief take a different course.'' He added: ''Some of his political views did begin to coalesce around the time of my father's passing.''
His self-reliance followed him to summer camp, where as a counselor he canoed and hiked, and into young adulthood, where he took up deer hunting, a fact noted in his engagement notice in 2000 in The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ''Ryan is an avid hunter and fisherman,'' the paper reported, ''who does his own skinning and butchering and makes his own Polish sausage and bratwurst.'' 
It followed him into college, where he immediately took a passionate interest in the canon of conservative economic theorists and writers -- Ayn Rand and Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman and Ludwig von Mises -- who inspired the up-and-coming generation of libertarian-minded activists and lawmakers.
It followed him to Congress, where his brand of conservative economics, honed in Washington's conservative policy and research groups, eventually inspired the Tea Party freshmen in the House for whom Mr. Ryan has served as seer, cheerleader and workout buddy.
And, finally, it captured the imagination of Mitt Romney, who named Mr. Ryan as the Republicans' presumptive vice-presidential nominee on Saturday.
In Mr. Ryan, he has found not only a sympathetic life story to animate his campaign -- which he seized upon when he spoke on Saturday of how Mr. Ryan's father's death ''forced him to grow up earlier than any young man should'' -- but also a politician who fills in what many see as the gaps in Mr. Romney's conservative bona fides. Mr. Ryan is a strict supply-side budget expert and social conservative who counts fans across the Republican spectrum. He has been a driving force, if not always a visible one, in the party's biggest fights with President Obama, including last year's budget impasse that took the nation to the brink of default.
Mr. Ryan's enormous influence was apparent last summer when Representative Eric Cantor, the second most powerful House Republican, told Mr. Obama during negotiations over an attempted bipartisan ''grand bargain'' that Mr. Ryan disliked its policy and was concerned that a deal would pave the way for Mr. Obama's easy re-election, according to a Democrat and a Republican who were briefed on the conversation.
On Sunday, an official in Mr. Cantor's office disputed the characterization, and a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner, who was also there, said he ''has no recollection of such a discussion.''
Yet even if he is viewed as politically pure by the modern-day standards of his party's base, he is not without contradictions. The nation's first Generation X vice-presidential candidate, he is an avowed proponent of free markets whose family has interests in oil leases. But he counts Rage Against the Machine, which sings about the greed of oil companies and whose Web site praises the anti-corporate Occupy Wall Street movement, among his favorite bands.
He also voted for the bank bailout known as TARP and for President George W. Bush's prescription drug benefit for the elderly, both of which are loathed by Tea Party activists. And even as he delved more deeply into libertarian economic theory in college, his tuition was partially paid by the Social Security benefits he received after his father died.
Mr. Ryan's remarkable rise from small-town prom king to the No. 2 on the Republican presidential ticket reflects a combination of sheer will and patience, with the ideological leanings that began in Janesville and were cultivated in Washington finally finding their moment on a raised platform in Norfolk, Va., on Saturday morning.
A Janesville Childhood: Fun, Faith and Politics
Mr. Ryan, the youngest of Paul M. and Betty Ryan's four children, was born in 1970 and grew up in Janesville's historic Courthouse Hill neighborhood, where he still lives. A passel of neighborhood kids graduated from riding bicycles to the usual antics of high school.
Roz Thorpe, who raised her family across the street from the Ryans, said her own son and young Paul annually canvassed the neighborhood for donations to the charity promoted by Jerry Lewis. ''There was this whole group of kids, and they just had a great time,'' Mrs. Thorpe said. ''Paul was maybe a little more serious than the others.''
An uncle started a neighborhood Fourth of July parade decades ago, and Mr. Ryan's father was a respected lawyer in town.
Not quite a nerd (he was a bit too cute for that) and not precisely a jock (his soccer career lasted a single year, his high school coach said), Mr. Ryan was best known for being outgoing, much like his mother. He was studious and interested in the outdoor life, which he cultivated as a counselor at Camp Manito-wish, run by the Y.M.C.A.
Mr. Ryan's political views may have been inspired around the dinner table when he was a teenager, according to his brother. ''Every night at 6 we had family dinner, and we discussed things,'' Tobin Ryan said.
''We would talk about what Ronald Reagan was doing, the course of action he was bringing for our country, and Paul was absorbing these things,'' he said. ''I don't think it was a great professor who opened his eyes in college.
''The part of his speech that hit me hard was his mentioning that my father said we should all be part of the solution, not the problem,'' Tobin Ryan said, referring to his brother's speech after Mr. Romney's announcement on Saturday in Virginia.
The Ryans are Catholic -- Paul was an altar boy -- which was ''an important part of Paul's value system,'' Tobin Ryan said. ''We were raised to develop our faith and beliefs independently.'' Mr. Ryan, more than his wife, Janna, often takes their three children to church, Mrs. Thorpe said.
Mr. Ryan's Congressional voting record reflects a religiously conservative bent; he was a co-sponsor of legislation that would have declared human life to begin at fertilization.
His childhood was interrupted in his sophomore year of high school, when Mr. Ryan discovered his father dead in his bed of a heart attack. ''I remember looking out the front door and seeing the paramedics,'' Mrs. Thorpe said. ''Paul came to our house and stayed with us for the remainder of the day and was really pretty upset. Paul was always a pretty levelheaded kid. This was a very big event.''
Mr. Ryan's mother went back to college, and with his two oldest siblings long gone from home, he began to rely even more on Tobin for emotional support and guidance. ''He and I shared a bedroom growing up,'' said Tobin Ryan, who is five years older than his brother. ''I have him to blame for having clouds and little birdies on my wall in my teenager years.''
He added: ''We certainly went through a lot and grew even closer through that experience. You saw a normal teenager sort of wake up the next day without a father, an 80-year-old grandmother with advanced Alzheimer's in the room next door and mother who decides to go back to college.''
The next year, Mr. Ryan ran for class president and won. He also immersed himself in after-school jobs and other extracurricular activities.
''He just seemed to be involved in a lot of things,'' said Patrick Lyons, a childhood friend with whom Mr. Ryan still spends weekends barbecuing at each other's homes (going out to dinner has become harder with the rise of Mr. Ryan's political celebrity). His numerous activities in high school led to an award suggesting that he was, in polite terms, a politically astute suck-up.
His brother's role as confidant remains, and he is perhaps the center of Mr. Ryan's brain trust. ''We live a block away from each other,'' Tobin Ryan said. ''We consult on everything. Paul and I have allowed our lives to become intertwined. Our kids go to the same school. Our wives talk every day.''
In College, A Freshman With a Ph.D. Attitude
Paul Ryan was already steeped in conservative economic theory by the end of his freshman year at Miami University in Ohio, where he arrived in 1988.
''He was a normal college student,'' Tobin Ryan said, ''except when it came to economic policy. He was a Ph.D. student in freshmen's clothes. I recall him referring to Hayek. I was an economics major myself; I don't think I was as enthusiastic.''
Mr. Ryan's trickle-down economic theories were already in place, said Professor Rich Hart, who would help Mr. Ryan hone his political persona.
''I think Paul came to Miami University with these core conservative beliefs from an economic standpoint,'' said Professor Hart, an outspoken libertarian who taught an intermediate macroeconomic theory course that Mr. Ryan took in his junior year. ''He was reading Locke and Hayek, and I don't know if he was reading Ayn Rand, but I had certainly read Ayn Rand, and I talked to him about it.''
The two would often meet outside class, not to talk about the course, Mr. Hart said, but to discuss political philosophy. ''We had these discussions about the role of government. We both believed in the conservative view that government should be limited, because the most important thing is individual freedom, individual liberty, and along with that freedom goes individual responsibility.''
Thomas Hall, a professor of economics at the college, said Mr. Ryan's intelligence was matched by his confidence and communications skills. ''He was one of the best students in the class,'' he said. ''He was conscientious, and he was especially articulate, both verbally and in writing ability.''
Mr. Ryan's public speaking ''stood out from the other students,'' Mr. Hall said. ''He also had a quiet confidence that stood out. What I mean by that is that he was a confident young man in a pleasant way. He was confident without being full of himself.''
In college, Mr. Ryan would take in Green Bay Packers games on television, play on his fraternity's football team or work out in a gym across the street from the fraternity house.
''I would not call him a partyer,'' said Kent Taylor, 40, a sports anchorman in Louisville, Ky., and a former fraternity brother of Mr. Ryan's at Delta Tau Delta. ''He was pretty serious and focused all the time and knew what he wanted to do. He was locked into his academics. He was interested in the economy and how it works from an early age in college. I think his seriousness set him apart from other folks in the fraternity and the university as a whole.''
Mr. Ryan earned a bachelor of arts degree in economics and political science in 1992, and his political leanings and ambitions were right there on the surface, friends said. ''Paul was always a politician,'' said Scott Friedman, a former fraternity brother who was a year behind Mr. Ryan. ''He was friendly with everybody. He was into debating the issues, and he was into talking about policy and economics.''
Conversations centered less on girls and football and more on the policy issues of the day. ''I always knew that he was a conservative Republican, and I knew that he wanted to be a congressman from his college days,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''Typically, the discussions with him were around adultlike stuff. He would talk about trickle-down economics and why that would be a better approach to running the country's economy.''
As it happened, the university was in the district of a congressman named John A. Boehner, and in 1992, Mr. Ryan served as a volunteer on his campaign, putting up yard signs. ''He had a much more worldly perspective than other students, in the sense that he was not interested in level, flat conversations about the mundane,'' said A. G. Hollis, 41, who owns a real estate company in Chicago and is another former fraternity brother.
First Run For the House, With Jack Kemp's Help
In 1998, as Mr. Ryan was making his first run for elective office, a nationally known politician -- the party's vice-presidential candidate two years earlier -- came to Janesville to campaign for him: Jack Kemp, Mr. Ryan's mentor, was in town.
The two had become close during Mr. Ryan's years as a legislative aide and policy analyst in Washington. It was a relationship that went beyond the two men's shared interest in tax cuts and supply-side economics. ''I think he sort of viewed Jack Kemp as something of a second father,'' Professor Hart said.
The relationship began when Mr. Ryan was in college. In 1991, Professor Hart recommended him for a summer internship in the office of Senator Bob Kasten, a Wisconsin Republican who had worked closely with Mr. Kemp. Mr. Kasten remembers Mr. Ryan as intellectually curious and interested in policy far more than he was in politics. ''He was just interested in the ideas,'' said Mr. Kasten, who was defeated by Russ Feingold, a Democrat, in 1992. ''We never talked about him someday wanting to be a congressman or a senator or a vice president.''
Mr. Ryan joined Mr. Kasten's staff full time after graduating from Miami University, working on issues like tax incentives for small businesses and a reduction in the capital gains tax. A few months after Mr. Kasten lost his seat, Mr. Ryan went to work for Empower America, a conservative advocacy group that was founded by Mr. Kemp; Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations under President Reagan; and William J. Bennett, a former education secretary in Mr. Reagan's administration.
Mr. Ryan was drawn to Ms. Kirkpatrick's emphasis on foreign policy and to Mr. Bennett's interest in morality, but he was most animated when he worked with Mr. Kemp, said Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota who was among Empower America's founders and who ran the group. ''He worked mainly around Kemp on economic policy,'' Mr. Weber said. ''That was his passion.''
Judith Nolan, Mr. Kemp's daughter, worked in community outreach at Empower America during the time that Mr. Ryan was there. She said her father often turned to the young staff member for advice.
''My dad was so impressed with him,'' she said, adding that he often had Mr. Ryan act as his researcher. ''It impressed me that my dad, who had loved economics and studied it, would turn to someone so young.''
There was also pride, she added. ''He definitely treated him like a son and would put his arm around him and introduce him and say, 'Here's the future of our party.' '' Mr. Kemp's son Jimmy, who runs the Jack Kemp Foundation, says he sees a direct link between his father's message of the 1990s and Mr. Ryan's in 2012. ''When Paul talked about America being an idea in his Saturday morning speech in Norfolk, that was very consistent with Dad's message,'' Mr. Kemp said. ''Dad believed in the power of ideas, that humans get their rights not from the government, but from nature and God, as Paul described.''
In 1997, Mr. Ryan decided to move back to Janesville, where he worked for a time in the family construction business founded by his great-grandfather. He sought a House seat the next year, sharing his ambitions with the Thorpes. ''We were visiting D.C., and he came to dinner with us one night and talked to us about running,'' Mrs. Thorpe said. ''We encouraged him. At that point he had been living there a long time, and it just seemed natural.''
Mr. Ryan, campaigning against tax increases and in favor of gun ownership rights, won that first race handily, 57 percent to 43 percent.
Over the years, Mr. Ryan's emphasis shifted. Mr. Kemp was not nearly as concerned with cutting government programs as Mr. Ryan is today. They agreed on taxes, but their views on spending and the role of government were different.
Mr. Ryan has become much more of a deficit hawk than Mr. Kemp, who died in 2009, ever was. But they shared an optimistic outlook and a core belief that politics could be waged in a civil manner. Last year, the Jack Kemp Foundation honored Mr. Ryan with its first Kemp Leadership Award, and Joanne Kemp, Mr. Kemp's widow, attended a Romney-Ryan rally in Manassas, Va., on Saturday. Mr. Ryan publicly recognized her there, and cited Mr. Kemp as one of his mentors.
''He's much more of a number cruncher than my father was,'' Mr. Kemp said, ''but I think one of the lessons he learned from Dad was to communicate with a smile, and there's no need to attack opposing politicians on a personal level because the arguments should be about ideas.''
The Tea Party Finds a Voice on Capitol Hill
Ask one of the 87 Republican freshmen who came rolling into Washington in 2010 -- many of them with no political experience -- whom they most idolize in Congress, and chances are Paul Ryan's name will come up. Mr. Ryan speaks their language of shrinking government, shares their passion for chin-out communications and is culturally and politically more in sync with newer members, many of them say, than some of the other more senior members, including some in the leadership.
He is, in essence, the leader of a team that followed him to Washington. ''Our class that came was a mandate against what had been happening in the House,'' said Representative Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, who worked as a nurse before being elected. ''He has been fighting this fight for years and years, and we were able to come in and help and support him.''
His willingness to articulate his beliefs, and stick to them even when they are used as a baseball bat against his party, has drawn admiration too. ''Sometimes we talk about what needs to be done together to shrink the size of government,'' Ms. Ellmers said, ''but then we hold back a little on how we message it. He was right out there; he took it all, and he put himself right in the forefront.
For less experienced members, Mr. Ryan's knowledge of the federal budget has also been animating. Many wander into his office for advice on how to vote on bills, or, in the beginning, how to decode them.
Representative Trey Gowdy, a Republican, said that Mr. Ryan even took time to call constituents in his South Carolina district who were displeased with the spate of short-term budget measures used to keep the government running. ''There are not many people of his station in Congress who would sit in his office and call someone else's constituents to explain something.'' Mr. Ryan, as a joke, has also offered to pay for and schedule haircuts for Mr. Gowdy, who often needs them.
Several members recalled a meeting last year with Mr. Obama, who had invited Republicans to the White House for an off-the-record conversation about the debt and deficit. According to some who attended, Mr. Obama conceded in the meeting that he understood entitlement programs needed to be changed if they were to be sustained. Mr. Ryan then accused Mr. Obama of failing to lead on cutting entitlements, as other members looked on in shock and amusement.
That does not mean that Mr. Ryan has not had to work overtime whipping members to vote for his budget, which did not cut as much as some of them would have liked. Admiration is no guarantee of agreement, as Mr. Boehner, now the House speaker, has learned.
Mr. Ryan's charms have also worked on Democrats, but only to a point. Likability does not translate to agreeability.
In an interview, former Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, a centrist Democrat, said he was impressed when Mr. Ryan reached out to him to discuss tackling entitlements after Mr. Bayh made one of his frequent calls for fiscal responsibility.
''He came to visit me in my office and was very nice and laid out some of his ideas about entitlement reform,'' Mr. Bayh said. Still, complimenting Mr. Ryan as ''a nice, humble guy,'' Mr. Bayh added, ''I thought some of his ideas went a little too far.''
Indeed, even as Mr. Ryan calls for bipartisan agreement on the most important -- and thorny -- domestic political issues, his own proposals strike at the heart of Democratic orthodoxy. And he has played a central role in nearly all of the big policy fights against the opposition party that have defined the past few years.
His legislation with Senator John E. Sununu of New Hampshire to create private investment accounts for Social Security benefits became a starting point for talks over Mr. Bush's plan to do so at the start of his second term. Mr. Bush ultimately dropped his bid to overhaul Social Security, unable to overcome resistance from Democrats, some Republicans and elderly voters who expressed fear it would gut the program.
That, of course, was only a precursor to his attempts during Mr. Obama's presidency to change the way Medicare is administered and vastly cut government spending while holding a line against taxes.
Even as he was climbing the ranks and emerging as his party's most forceful spokesman for cutting entitlement spending, Mr. Ryan was becoming one of the House's most prodigious fund-raisers. Many donors, especially libertarian-leaning financiers, envisioned him as a future presidential contender.
In a contrast to life with rank and file in the House, Mr. Ryan joined Cliff Asness, a prominent hedge fund founder, and a friend of Mr. Asness's for a meal last year at an expensive Capitol Hill bistro, where the three men shared two $350 bottles of Pinot Noir.
''I wanted to pick his brain,'' Mr. Ryan explained about the dinner date to Talking Points Memo, a news Web site, which obtained pictures of the meal from another diner. The meeting with Mr. Asness, a leading Republican donor, marked Mr. Ryan's entry into elite donor circles: When Mr. Ryan presented his budget plan at the Economic Club of Chicago last year, he was introduced by Anne Griffin, who with her husband, Kenneth, is a major donor to conservative causes. Executives working for Charles and David Koch, the billionaire conservative philanthropists, are now among the top donors to Mr. Ryan's campaign committee and leadership PAC, as are employees of the hedge fund founded by the conservative billionaire Paul Singer.
So far during the 2012 election, Mr. Ryan's campaign committee and his leadership PAC have raised more than $8.5 million, one of the biggest totals in Congress. Mr. Ryan has used the money to amass influence among like-minded conservatives in the House, transferring more than a million dollars to other Republican candidates and party committees, and he has teamed up with other self-styled ''Young Guns,'' like Mr. Cantor, to groom and raise money for promising candidates.
But fund-raising has also brought Mr. Ryan some headaches. Beginning in the late 1990s, a Wisconsin businessman, Dennis Troha, and members of his family began donating tens of thousands of dollars to Mr. Ryan's campaigns, while Mr. Troha helped organize a fund-raiser for the lawmaker.
In 2005, Mr. Ryan signed a letter urging his colleagues to approve a provision sought by JHT Trucking, a company in his district, easing federal trucking rules, and also urged Bush administration officials to adopt the change, which was adopted. The following year, Mr. Ryan pressured federal regulators to issue a decision on an application to build a Wisconsin casino, a project in which Mr. Troha at the time held a stake.
Mr. Ryan had defended the interventions as routine constituent service. But in 2007, Mr. Troha pleaded guilty to federal charges that he had evaded campaign contribution limits by using his children to funnel contributions to Gov. Jim Doyle of Wisconsin, a Democrat, and President George W. Bush, in an effort to advance the trucking bill and casino development. An associate of Mr. Troha also pleaded guilty to charges that he had worked with Mr. Troha to funnel illegal corporate contributions to elected officials, including Mr. Ryan.
Mr. Ryan was not implicated in the investigations or charged with any crime, and there was no indication he knew the contributions were tainted. Following Mr. Troha's indictment, he donated the family's contributions to charity.
Serving His District and Building a Fortune
Mr. Ryan had barely been in Congress two weeks when a crisis hit his hometown: Gillette announced that it was closing its Parker Pen factory and moving about 300 jobs overseas.
Parker Pen had long been the pride of Janesville, a blue-collar city where George S. Parker II, an heir to the pen maker's founder, still lived in an imposing Georgian-style brick house around the corner from Mr. Ryan's childhood home. The closing announcement in January 1999 was bitterly painful, and Mr. Ryan's office let it be known that he was working to help the community cope.
But there was not much Mr. Ryan or anyone else could do to prevent the plant from closing, so Janesville absorbed the hit and moved on. And so did Mr. Ryan, getting elected six more times and, in a twist that says much about how far he has come since he was elected to Congress at age 28, eventually buying Mr. Parker's 5,800-square-foot, six-bedroom estate.
Mr. Ryan and his wife, Janna, purchased the house for $421,000 in 2010, a price they could easily afford. The Ryans have assets that were valued last year between $2 million and $7.7 million, according to Mr. Ryan's personal financial disclosures, putting him in the upper echelons of House members in terms of wealth.
Still, while the Ryans are affluent by any measure, their wealth is not on the scale of Mr. Romney's or of Capitol Hill's richest, whose assets are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And the Ryans are not known for conspicuous displays of wealth.
The old Parker house had been vacant for six years and needed a lot of work when the Ryans bought it. Rather than hire an army of contractors, Mr. Ryan did much of the renovation himself, neighbors said. State Senator Tim Cullen, a Democrat from Janesville who has known the Ryan family for most of his life, recalled Mr. Ryan coming outside to chat with him one day shortly after buying the house.
''The door was open, and he was wearing old clothes and was in there doing the painting and repair work himself,'' Mr. Cullen said. ''That's just who he is, very much a product of Janesville -- down-to-earth, basic people.''
Mr. Ryan is famous for sleeping in his office while in Washington, and he enjoys the same no-frills recreational pursuits -- hunting, fishing and working out -- that he has pursued since before he was married. Mrs. Ryan, a tax lawyer, put her professional career aside to raise their three young children. Family vacations tend toward backpacking outings.
Much of the Ryans' wealth is in the form of trusts and inheritances, some of them acquired fairly recently.
Mr. Ryan reported two tax-deferred college savings plans, with a combined value of between $150,000 and $300,000. He also reported two investment partnerships worth, in total, between $350,000 and $750,000, mostly containing shares of stock in well-known companies, including Apple, Goodrich, Kraft Foods, Visa and Whole Foods. Both partnerships were formed by Mr. Ryan and other family members to manage assets left by his grandparents and an aunt.
Mrs. Ryan has reported receiving a trust after her mother died in 2010 that is valued between $1 million and $5 million, according to a letter Mr. Ryan filed with his latest financial disclosure. Mrs. Ryan also has longstanding interests in several mining and oil exploration investments in Oklahoma and Texas managed by her father, Dan Little, a lawyer in Oklahoma whose clients include oil and gas companies. Those investments generated as much as $150,000 in income last year.
Friends say that the Ryans visit Mrs. Ryan's relatives in Oklahoma, where she is from, several times a year, but that she generally prefers to stay at home in Janesville. Mr. Ryan has also seemed to try to stay close to home despite his rising profile in Washington, sometimes leaving Washington for Janesville on Thursday evenings and delaying his return to the capital until Tuesday mornings.
Weighing In on a Bargain on the Deficit and Debt
Last summer, as the nation faced a potentially cataclysmic debt default, President Obama met at the White House with a handful of Congressional leaders in an attempt to reach a ''grand bargain'' that could avert disaster -- and, more important, overcome partisan gridlock to balance the budget over the long term.
During the talks, Mr. Obama invited Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor into the Oval Office, where the conversation was said to include possible sticking points, including Mr. Ryan's concerns. But by then, Mr. Ryan had articulated his worries on policy grounds, saying he did not believe that the White House and the Democrats were willing to make the spending cuts he viewed as necessary to balance the budget.
And, in an interview with CNN to discuss the talks that July, he said that the Democrats were failing to agree to lower overall tax rates that Republicans were seeking in return for closing loopholes, which ultimately, he warned, would lead to tax increases. ''That is not what we saw coming together with this big deal,'' he said in the interview. ''And if you don't get the tax rates down, then it really is a tax increase.''
Similar opposition to the deficit deals proposed by the Simpson-Bowles commission -- on which he sat as a member -- and a Senate group known as the Gang of Six has led Democrats to question the seriousness of his calls for bipartisanship. Those questions are certain to feed Obama campaign attacks in the coming weeks.
As a congressman, Mr. Ryan has never been under the heavy fire of a national -- or even a statewide -- campaign. And as the presidential campaign heats up, Janesville should become more of a refuge for him than ever.
Up until now, said people around Janesville, it feels as if Mr. Ryan has never really left.
Like many of the more conservative members of Congress, he had chosen not to take an apartment in Washington, living instead in his office or occasionally staying with relatives in Maryland. He often holds town-hall-style meetings, and he called his hometown paper, The Gazette, on Saturday night to give them an account of his decision to join the campaign. Mr. Ryan is also a bit of a fixture at his children's school, where he tries to attend events.
''We try not to talk about politics when he is in town,'' Mr. Lyons said. ''They are not into status or anything like that. To me it's still just Paul.''

 BODY:
JANESVILLE, Wis. -- Representative Paul D. Ryan's childhood home here was not overtly partisan. His parents were enthusiastic supporters of Representative Les Aspin, a Democrat, yet adored President Ronald Reagan from their glimpses of him on the evening news. But the death of his father when Mr. Ryan was only 16 punctured his life of math tests and bike riding, and in that fissure, the seeds of his worldview were planted.''Paul went to work at McDonald's and began to pull his own weight, and becomes class president the same year,'' said his brother Tobin. ''It is remarkable that he chose a path of individual responsibility and maturity rather than letting grief take a different course.'' He added: ''Some of his political views did begin to coalesce around the time of my father's passing.''
His self-reliance followed him to summer camp, where as a counselor he canoed and hiked, and into young adulthood, where he took up deer hunting, a fact noted in his engagement notice in 2000 in The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ''Ryan is an avid hunter and fisherman,'' the paper reported, ''who does his own skinning and butchering and makes his own Polish sausage and bratwurst.'' 
It followed him into college, where he immediately took a passionate interest in the canon of conservative economic theorists and writers -- Ayn Rand and Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman and Ludwig von Mises -- who inspired the up-and-coming generation of libertarian-minded activists and lawmakers.
It followed him to Congress, where his brand of conservative economics, honed in Washington's conservative policy and research groups, eventually inspired the Tea Party freshmen in the House for whom Mr. Ryan has served as seer, cheerleader and workout buddy.
And, finally, it captured the imagination of Mitt Romney, who named Mr. Ryan as the Republicans' presumptive vice-presidential nominee on Saturday.
In Mr. Ryan, he has found not only a sympathetic life story to animate his campaign -- which he seized upon when he spoke on Saturday of how Mr. Ryan's father's death ''forced him to grow up earlier than any young man should'' -- but also a politician who fills in what many see as the gaps in Mr. Romney's conservative bona fides. Mr. Ryan is a strict supply-side budget expert and social conservative who counts fans across the Republican spectrum. He has been a driving force, if not always a visible one, in the party's biggest fights with President Obama, including last year's budget impasse that took the nation to the brink of default.
Mr. Ryan's enormous influence was apparent last summer when Representative Eric Cantor, the second most powerful House Republican, told Mr. Obama during negotiations over an attempted bipartisan ''grand bargain'' that Mr. Ryan disliked its policy and was concerned that a deal would pave the way for Mr. Obama's easy re-election, according to a Democrat and a Republican who were briefed on the conversation.
On Sunday, an official in Mr. Cantor's office disputed the characterization, and a spokesman for House Speaker John A. Boehner, who was also there, said he ''has no recollection of such a discussion.''
Yet even if he is viewed as politically pure by the modern-day standards of his party's base, he is not without contradictions. The nation's first Generation X vice-presidential candidate, he is an avowed proponent of free markets whose family has interests in oil leases. But he counts Rage Against the Machine, which sings about the greed of oil companies and whose Web site praises the anti-corporate Occupy Wall Street movement, among his favorite bands.
He also voted for the bank bailout known as TARP and for President George W. Bush's prescription drug benefit for the elderly, both of which are loathed by Tea Party activists. And even as he delved more deeply into libertarian economic theory in college, his tuition was partially paid by the Social Security benefits he received after his father died.
Mr. Ryan's remarkable rise from small-town prom king to the No. 2 on the Republican presidential ticket reflects a combination of sheer will and patience, with the ideological leanings that began in Janesville and were cultivated in Washington finally finding their moment on a raised platform in Norfolk, Va., on Saturday morning.
A Janesville Childhood: Fun, Faith and Politics
Mr. Ryan, the youngest of Paul M. and Betty Ryan's four children, was born in 1970 and grew up in Janesville's historic Courthouse Hill neighborhood, where he still lives. A passel of neighborhood kids graduated from riding bicycles to the usual antics of high school.
Roz Thorpe, who raised her family across the street from the Ryans, said her own son and young Paul annually canvassed the neighborhood for donations to the charity promoted by Jerry Lewis. ''There was this whole group of kids, and they just had a great time,'' Mrs. Thorpe said. ''Paul was maybe a little more serious than the others.''
An uncle started a neighborhood Fourth of July parade decades ago, and Mr. Ryan's father was a respected lawyer in town.
Not quite a nerd (he was a bit too cute for that) and not precisely a jock (his soccer career lasted a single year, his high school coach said), Mr. Ryan was best known for being outgoing, much like his mother. He was studious and interested in the outdoor life, which he cultivated as a counselor at Camp Manito-wish, run by the Y.M.C.A.
Mr. Ryan's political views may have been inspired around the dinner table when he was a teenager, according to his brother. ''Every night at 6 we had family dinner, and we discussed things,'' Tobin Ryan said.
''We would talk about what Ronald Reagan was doing, the course of action he was bringing for our country, and Paul was absorbing these things,'' he said. ''I don't think it was a great professor who opened his eyes in college.
''The part of his speech that hit me hard was his mentioning that my father said we should all be part of the solution, not the problem,'' Tobin Ryan said, referring to his brother's speech after Mr. Romney's announcement on Saturday in Virginia.
The Ryans are Catholic -- Paul was an altar boy -- which was ''an important part of Paul's value system,'' Tobin Ryan said. ''We were raised to develop our faith and beliefs independently.'' Mr. Ryan, more than his wife, Janna, often takes their three children to church, Mrs. Thorpe said.
Mr. Ryan's Congressional voting record reflects a religiously conservative bent; he was a co-sponsor of legislation that would have declared human life to begin at fertilization.
His childhood was interrupted in his sophomore year of high school, when Mr. Ryan discovered his father dead in his bed of a heart attack. ''I remember looking out the front door and seeing the paramedics,'' Mrs. Thorpe said. ''Paul came to our house and stayed with us for the remainder of the day and was really pretty upset. Paul was always a pretty levelheaded kid. This was a very big event.''
Mr. Ryan's mother went back to college, and with his two oldest siblings long gone from home, he began to rely even more on Tobin for emotional support and guidance. ''He and I shared a bedroom growing up,'' said Tobin Ryan, who is five years older than his brother. ''I have him to blame for having clouds and little birdies on my wall in my teenager years.''
He added: ''We certainly went through a lot and grew even closer through that experience. You saw a normal teenager sort of wake up the next day without a father, an 80-year-old grandmother with advanced Alzheimer's in the room next door and mother who decides to go back to college.''
The next year, Mr. Ryan ran for class president and won. He also immersed himself in after-school jobs and other extracurricular activities.
''He just seemed to be involved in a lot of things,'' said Patrick Lyons, a childhood friend with whom Mr. Ryan still spends weekends barbecuing at each other's homes (going out to dinner has become harder with the rise of Mr. Ryan's political celebrity). His numerous activities in high school led to an award suggesting that he was, in polite terms, a politically astute suck-up.
His brother's role as confidant remains, and he is perhaps the center of Mr. Ryan's brain trust. ''We live a block away from each other,'' Tobin Ryan said. ''We consult on everything. Paul and I have allowed our lives to become intertwined. Our kids go to the same school. Our wives talk every day.''
In College, A Freshman With a Ph.D. Attitude
Paul Ryan was already steeped in conservative economic theory by the end of his freshman year at Miami University in Ohio, where he arrived in 1988.
''He was a normal college student,'' Tobin Ryan said, ''except when it came to economic policy. He was a Ph.D. student in freshmen's clothes. I recall him referring to Hayek. I was an economics major myself; I don't think I was as enthusiastic.''
Mr. Ryan's trickle-down economic theories were already in place, said Professor Rich Hart, who would help Mr. Ryan hone his political persona.
''I think Paul came to Miami University with these core conservative beliefs from an economic standpoint,'' said Professor Hart, an outspoken libertarian who taught an intermediate macroeconomic theory course that Mr. Ryan took in his junior year. ''He was reading Locke and Hayek, and I don't know if he was reading Ayn Rand, but I had certainly read Ayn Rand, and I talked to him about it.''
The two would often meet outside class, not to talk about the course, Mr. Hart said, but to discuss political philosophy. ''We had these discussions about the role of government. We both believed in the conservative view that government should be limited, because the most important thing is individual freedom, individual liberty, and along with that freedom goes individual responsibility.''
Thomas Hall, a professor of economics at the college, said Mr. Ryan's intelligence was matched by his confidence and communications skills. ''He was one of the best students in the class,'' he said. ''He was conscientious, and he was especially articulate, both verbally and in writing ability.''
Mr. Ryan's public speaking ''stood out from the other students,'' Mr. Hall said. ''He also had a quiet confidence that stood out. What I mean by that is that he was a confident young man in a pleasant way. He was confident without being full of himself.''
In college, Mr. Ryan would take in Green Bay Packers games on television, play on his fraternity's football team or work out in a gym across the street from the fraternity house.
''I would not call him a partyer,'' said Kent Taylor, 40, a sports anchorman in Louisville, Ky., and a former fraternity brother of Mr. Ryan's at Delta Tau Delta. ''He was pretty serious and focused all the time and knew what he wanted to do. He was locked into his academics. He was interested in the economy and how it works from an early age in college. I think his seriousness set him apart from other folks in the fraternity and the university as a whole.''
Mr. Ryan earned a bachelor of arts degree in economics and political science in 1992, and his political leanings and ambitions were right there on the surface, friends said. ''Paul was always a politician,'' said Scott Friedman, a former fraternity brother who was a year behind Mr. Ryan. ''He was friendly with everybody. He was into debating the issues, and he was into talking about policy and economics.''
Conversations centered less on girls and football and more on the policy issues of the day. ''I always knew that he was a conservative Republican, and I knew that he wanted to be a congressman from his college days,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''Typically, the discussions with him were around adultlike stuff. He would talk about trickle-down economics and why that would be a better approach to running the country's economy.''
As it happened, the university was in the district of a congressman named John A. Boehner, and in 1992, Mr. Ryan served as a volunteer on his campaign, putting up yard signs. ''He had a much more worldly perspective than other students, in the sense that he was not interested in level, flat conversations about the mundane,'' said A. G. Hollis, 41, who owns a real estate company in Chicago and is another former fraternity brother.
First Run For the House, With Jack Kemp's Help
In 1998, as Mr. Ryan was making his first run for elective office, a nationally known politician -- the party's vice-presidential candidate two years earlier -- came to Janesville to campaign for him: Jack Kemp, Mr. Ryan's mentor, was in town.
The two had become close during Mr. Ryan's years as a legislative aide and policy analyst in Washington. It was a relationship that went beyond the two men's shared interest in tax cuts and supply-side economics. ''I think he sort of viewed Jack Kemp as something of a second father,'' Professor Hart said.
The relationship began when Mr. Ryan was in college. In 1991, Professor Hart recommended him for a summer internship in the office of Senator Bob Kasten, a Wisconsin Republican who had worked closely with Mr. Kemp. Mr. Kasten remembers Mr. Ryan as intellectually curious and interested in policy far more than he was in politics. ''He was just interested in the ideas,'' said Mr. Kasten, who was defeated by Russ Feingold, a Democrat, in 1992. ''We never talked about him someday wanting to be a congressman or a senator or a vice president.''
Mr. Ryan joined Mr. Kasten's staff full time after graduating from Miami University, working on issues like tax incentives for small businesses and a reduction in the capital gains tax. A few months after Mr. Kasten lost his seat, Mr. Ryan went to work for Empower America, a conservative advocacy group that was founded by Mr. Kemp; Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, a former United States ambassador to the United Nations under President Reagan; and William J. Bennett, a former education secretary in Mr. Reagan's administration.
Mr. Ryan was drawn to Ms. Kirkpatrick's emphasis on foreign policy and to Mr. Bennett's interest in morality, but he was most animated when he worked with Mr. Kemp, said Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota who was among Empower America's founders and who ran the group. ''He worked mainly around Kemp on economic policy,'' Mr. Weber said. ''That was his passion.''
Judith Nolan, Mr. Kemp's daughter, worked in community outreach at Empower America during the time that Mr. Ryan was there. She said her father often turned to the young staff member for advice.
''My dad was so impressed with him,'' she said, adding that he often had Mr. Ryan act as his researcher. ''It impressed me that my dad, who had loved economics and studied it, would turn to someone so young.''
There was also pride, she added. ''He definitely treated him like a son and would put his arm around him and introduce him and say, 'Here's the future of our party.' '' Mr. Kemp's son Jimmy, who runs the Jack Kemp Foundation, says he sees a direct link between his father's message of the 1990s and Mr. Ryan's in 2012. ''When Paul talked about America being an idea in his Saturday morning speech in Norfolk, that was very consistent with Dad's message,'' Mr. Kemp said. ''Dad believed in the power of ideas, that humans get their rights not from the government, but from nature and God, as Paul described.''
In 1997, Mr. Ryan decided to move back to Janesville, where he worked for a time in the family construction business founded by his great-grandfather. He sought a House seat the next year, sharing his ambitions with the Thorpes. ''We were visiting D.C., and he came to dinner with us one night and talked to us about running,'' Mrs. Thorpe said. ''We encouraged him. At that point he had been living there a long time, and it just seemed natural.''
Mr. Ryan, campaigning against tax increases and in favor of gun ownership rights, won that first race handily, 57 percent to 43 percent.
Over the years, Mr. Ryan's emphasis shifted. Mr. Kemp was not nearly as concerned with cutting government programs as Mr. Ryan is today. They agreed on taxes, but their views on spending and the role of government were different.
Mr. Ryan has become much more of a deficit hawk than Mr. Kemp, who died in 2009, ever was. But they shared an optimistic outlook and a core belief that politics could be waged in a civil manner. Last year, the Jack Kemp Foundation honored Mr. Ryan with its first Kemp Leadership Award, and Joanne Kemp, Mr. Kemp's widow, attended a Romney-Ryan rally in Manassas, Va., on Saturday. Mr. Ryan publicly recognized her there, and cited Mr. Kemp as one of his mentors.
''He's much more of a number cruncher than my father was,'' Mr. Kemp said, ''but I think one of the lessons he learned from Dad was to communicate with a smile, and there's no need to attack opposing politicians on a personal level because the arguments should be about ideas.''
The Tea Party Finds a Voice on Capitol Hill
Ask one of the 87 Republican freshmen who came rolling into Washington in 2010 -- many of them with no political experience -- whom they most idolize in Congress, and chances are Paul Ryan's name will come up. Mr. Ryan speaks their language of shrinking government, shares their passion for chin-out communications and is culturally and politically more in sync with newer members, many of them say, than some of the other more senior members, including some in the leadership.
He is, in essence, the leader of a team that followed him to Washington. ''Our class that came was a mandate against what had been happening in the House,'' said Representative Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, who worked as a nurse before being elected. ''He has been fighting this fight for years and years, and we were able to come in and help and support him.''
His willingness to articulate his beliefs, and stick to them even when they are used as a baseball bat against his party, has drawn admiration too. ''Sometimes we talk about what needs to be done together to shrink the size of government,'' Ms. Ellmers said, ''but then we hold back a little on how we message it. He was right out there; he took it all, and he put himself right in the forefront.
For less experienced members, Mr. Ryan's knowledge of the federal budget has also been animating. Many wander into his office for advice on how to vote on bills, or, in the beginning, how to decode them.
Representative Trey Gowdy, a Republican, said that Mr. Ryan even took time to call constituents in his South Carolina district who were displeased with the spate of short-term budget measures used to keep the government running. ''There are not many people of his station in Congress who would sit in his office and call someone else's constituents to explain something.'' Mr. Ryan, as a joke, has also offered to pay for and schedule haircuts for Mr. Gowdy, who often needs them.
Several members recalled a meeting last year with Mr. Obama, who had invited Republicans to the White House for an off-the-record conversation about the debt and deficit. According to some who attended, Mr. Obama conceded in the meeting that he understood entitlement programs needed to be changed if they were to be sustained. Mr. Ryan then accused Mr. Obama of failing to lead on cutting entitlements, as other members looked on in shock and amusement.
That does not mean that Mr. Ryan has not had to work overtime whipping members to vote for his budget, which did not cut as much as some of them would have liked. Admiration is no guarantee of agreement, as Mr. Boehner, now the House speaker, has learned.
Mr. Ryan's charms have also worked on Democrats, but only to a point. Likability does not translate to agreeability.
In an interview, former Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana, a centrist Democrat, said he was impressed when Mr. Ryan reached out to him to discuss tackling entitlements after Mr. Bayh made one of his frequent calls for fiscal responsibility.
''He came to visit me in my office and was very nice and laid out some of his ideas about entitlement reform,'' Mr. Bayh said. Still, complimenting Mr. Ryan as ''a nice, humble guy,'' Mr. Bayh added, ''I thought some of his ideas went a little too far.''
Indeed, even as Mr. Ryan calls for bipartisan agreement on the most important -- and thorny -- domestic political issues, his own proposals strike at the heart of Democratic orthodoxy. And he has played a central role in nearly all of the big policy fights against the opposition party that have defined the past few years.
His legislation with Senator John E. Sununu of New Hampshire to create private investment accounts for Social Security benefits became a starting point for talks over Mr. Bush's plan to do so at the start of his second term. Mr. Bush ultimately dropped his bid to overhaul Social Security, unable to overcome resistance from Democrats, some Republicans and elderly voters who expressed fear it would gut the program.
That, of course, was only a precursor to his attempts during Mr. Obama's presidency to change the way Medicare is administered and vastly cut government spending while holding a line against taxes.
Even as he was climbing the ranks and emerging as his party's most forceful spokesman for cutting entitlement spending, Mr. Ryan was becoming one of the House's most prodigious fund-raisers. Many donors, especially libertarian-leaning financiers, envisioned him as a future presidential contender.
In a contrast to life with rank and file in the House, Mr. Ryan joined Cliff Asness, a prominent hedge fund founder, and a friend of Mr. Asness's for a meal last year at an expensive Capitol Hill bistro, where the three men shared two $350 bottles of Pinot Noir.
''I wanted to pick his brain,'' Mr. Ryan explained about the dinner date to Talking Points Memo, a news Web site, which obtained pictures of the meal from another diner. The meeting with Mr. Asness, a leading Republican donor, marked Mr. Ryan's entry into elite donor circles: When Mr. Ryan presented his budget plan at the Economic Club of Chicago last year, he was introduced by Anne Griffin, who with her husband, Kenneth, is a major donor to conservative causes. Executives working for Charles and David Koch, the billionaire conservative philanthropists, are now among the top donors to Mr. Ryan's campaign committee and leadership PAC, as are employees of the hedge fund founded by the conservative billionaire Paul Singer.
So far during the 2012 election, Mr. Ryan's campaign committee and his leadership PAC have raised more than $8.5 million, one of the biggest totals in Congress. Mr. Ryan has used the money to amass influence among like-minded conservatives in the House, transferring more than a million dollars to other Republican candidates and party committees, and he has teamed up with other self-styled ''Young Guns,'' like Mr. Cantor, to groom and raise money for promising candidates.
But fund-raising has also brought Mr. Ryan some headaches. Beginning in the late 1990s, a Wisconsin businessman, Dennis Troha, and members of his family began donating tens of thousands of dollars to Mr. Ryan's campaigns, while Mr. Troha helped organize a fund-raiser for the lawmaker.
In 2005, Mr. Ryan signed a letter urging his colleagues to approve a provision sought by JHT Trucking, a company in his district, easing federal trucking rules, and also urged Bush administration officials to adopt the change, which was adopted. The following year, Mr. Ryan pressured federal regulators to issue a decision on an application to build a Wisconsin casino, a project in which Mr. Troha at the time held a stake.
Mr. Ryan had defended the interventions as routine constituent service. But in 2007, Mr. Troha pleaded guilty to federal charges that he had evaded campaign contribution limits by using his children to funnel contributions to Gov. Jim Doyle of Wisconsin, a Democrat, and President George W. Bush, in an effort to advance the trucking bill and casino development. An associate of Mr. Troha also pleaded guilty to charges that he had worked with Mr. Troha to funnel illegal corporate contributions to elected officials, including Mr. Ryan.
Mr. Ryan was not implicated in the investigations or charged with any crime, and there was no indication he knew the contributions were tainted. Following Mr. Troha's indictment, he donated the family's contributions to charity.
Serving His District and Building a Fortune
Mr. Ryan had barely been in Congress two weeks when a crisis hit his hometown: Gillette announced that it was closing its Parker Pen factory and moving about 300 jobs overseas.
Parker Pen had long been the pride of Janesville, a blue-collar city where George S. Parker II, an heir to the pen maker's founder, still lived in an imposing Georgian-style brick house around the corner from Mr. Ryan's childhood home. The closing announcement in January 1999 was bitterly painful, and Mr. Ryan's office let it be known that he was working to help the community cope.
But there was not much Mr. Ryan or anyone else could do to prevent the plant from closing, so Janesville absorbed the hit and moved on. And so did Mr. Ryan, getting elected six more times and, in a twist that says much about how far he has come since he was elected to Congress at age 28, eventually buying Mr. Parker's 5,800-square-foot, six-bedroom estate.
Mr. Ryan and his wife, Janna, purchased the house for $421,000 in 2010, a price they could easily afford. The Ryans have assets that were valued last year between $2 million and $7.7 million, according to Mr. Ryan's personal financial disclosures, putting him in the upper echelons of House members in terms of wealth.
Still, while the Ryans are affluent by any measure, their wealth is not on the scale of Mr. Romney's or of Capitol Hill's richest, whose assets are in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And the Ryans are not known for conspicuous displays of wealth.
The old Parker house had been vacant for six years and needed a lot of work when the Ryans bought it. Rather than hire an army of contractors, Mr. Ryan did much of the renovation himself, neighbors said. State Senator Tim Cullen, a Democrat from Janesville who has known the Ryan family for most of his life, recalled Mr. Ryan coming outside to chat with him one day shortly after buying the house.
''The door was open, and he was wearing old clothes and was in there doing the painting and repair work himself,'' Mr. Cullen said. ''That's just who he is, very much a product of Janesville -- down-to-earth, basic people.''
Mr. Ryan is famous for sleeping in his office while in Washington, and he enjoys the same no-frills recreational pursuits -- hunting, fishing and working out -- that he has pursued since before he was married. Mrs. Ryan, a tax lawyer, put her professional career aside to raise their three young children. Family vacations tend toward backpacking outings.
Much of the Ryans' wealth is in the form of trusts and inheritances, some of them acquired fairly recently.
Mr. Ryan reported two tax-deferred college savings plans, with a combined value of between $150,000 and $300,000. He also reported two investment partnerships worth, in total, between $350,000 and $750,000, mostly containing shares of stock in well-known companies, including Apple, Goodrich, Kraft Foods, Visa and Whole Foods. Both partnerships were formed by Mr. Ryan and other family members to manage assets left by his grandparents and an aunt.
Mrs. Ryan has reported receiving a trust after her mother died in 2010 that is valued between $1 million and $5 million, according to a letter Mr. Ryan filed with his latest financial disclosure. Mrs. Ryan also has longstanding interests in several mining and oil exploration investments in Oklahoma and Texas managed by her father, Dan Little, a lawyer in Oklahoma whose clients include oil and gas companies. Those investments generated as much as $150,000 in income last year.
Friends say that the Ryans visit Mrs. Ryan's relatives in Oklahoma, where she is from, several times a year, but that she generally prefers to stay at home in Janesville. Mr. Ryan has also seemed to try to stay close to home despite his rising profile in Washington, sometimes leaving Washington for Janesville on Thursday evenings and delaying his return to the capital until Tuesday mornings.
Weighing In on a Bargain on the Deficit and Debt
Last summer, as the nation faced a potentially cataclysmic debt default, President Obama met at the White House with a handful of Congressional leaders in an attempt to reach a ''grand bargain'' that could avert disaster -- and, more important, overcome partisan gridlock to balance the budget over the long term.
During the talks, Mr. Obama invited Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor into the Oval Office, where the conversation was said to include possible sticking points, including Mr. Ryan's concerns. But by then, Mr. Ryan had articulated his worries on policy grounds, saying he did not believe that the White House and the Democrats were willing to make the spending cuts he viewed as necessary to balance the budget.
And, in an interview with CNN to discuss the talks that July, he said that the Democrats were failing to agree to lower overall tax rates that Republicans were seeking in return for closing loopholes, which ultimately, he warned, would lead to tax increases. ''That is not what we saw coming together with this big deal,'' he said in the interview. ''And if you don't get the tax rates down, then it really is a tax increase.''
Similar opposition to the deficit deals proposed by the Simpson-Bowles commission -- on which he sat as a member -- and a Senate group known as the Gang of Six has led Democrats to question the seriousness of his calls for bipartisanship. Those questions are certain to feed Obama campaign attacks in the coming weeks.
As a congressman, Mr. Ryan has never been under the heavy fire of a national -- or even a statewide -- campaign. And as the presidential campaign heats up, Janesville should become more of a refuge for him than ever.
Up until now, said people around Janesville, it feels as if Mr. Ryan has never really left.
Like many of the more conservative members of Congress, he had chosen not to take an apartment in Washington, living instead in his office or occasionally staying with relatives in Maryland. He often holds town-hall-style meetings, and he called his hometown paper, The Gazette, on Saturday night to give them an account of his decision to join the campaign. Mr. Ryan is also a bit of a fixture at his children's school, where he tries to attend events.
''We try not to talk about politics when he is in town,'' Mr. Lyons said. ''They are not into status or anything like that. To me it's still just Paul.''
The Long Run: Articles in this series are exploring the lives and careers of the candidates for president and vice president in 2012.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With: Social Scientist Anandi Mani

BYLINE: SRUTHI GOTTIPATI


HIGHLIGHT: Female political representatives ensure better documentation of crimes across India, study says. 

 BODY:
Q.
Could you tell me a little bit about your study? Why did you want to do this study?
A.
The Panchayati Raj [village council] reform law was passed officially in 1993 for local government. There has been a lot of resistance to repeated attempts to have similar reservation for women leaders at other levels of government. Some of the arguments against such reservation have been that women who lack experience will not be competent leaders. There is also a perception that women political representatives may be just fronts for the political agenda of their husbands or other powerful males in their area.
One motivation for such a reservation is to improve outcomes for women directly. So we thought it would be interesting to examine specifically how having women political representatives has affected a very core outcome for women -- safety and security.
Q.
Could you take me through the process and what you found?
When we looked at how crime outcomes against women changed before and after political representation, we found that crimes against women had increased overall, as well as in specific categories such as kidnapping and rape. This was very disturbing at first pass. It suggested that either there was a lot of resentment and retaliation against women leaders or that women leaders were quite incompetent.
A.
But we found that it was not explained by the incompetence of women political representatives, because there were no increases in crimes unrelated to women, such as economic crimes or kidnapping of men.
As researchers, we were also aware that official crime records data may not fully capture ground reality. Especially in developing countries, it could be fraught with problems in documenting crime. Typically, this would mean that crimes against women would be underreported. This could be either due to the prejudiced attitudes towards them from the police who may not record crimes against them. Or women themselves may be reluctant to report crimes because of shame or fear of retaliation.
In our particular context, we wondered whether this increase in crimes against women may actually be good news because women leaders may actually be encouraging more reporting of crimes against women. If we did not account for this, we could be jumping to the wrong conclusions. Here is a recent example of how crime data can lead people to wrong interpretations/conclusions.
One way to check this could have been to match up official records with victimization surveys of individuals, which could tell us if official statistics are widely off from what individuals report when interviewed. Unfortunately, in the Indian context, the handicap is that no such nationwide surveys exist, unlike in other countries such as the U.S. So we decided to address this challenge by looking at different pieces of related evidence. Specifically, we looked at how responsive the police were to crimes against women and also women's perceptions of their interaction with law enforcement authorities.
Q.
What did you find?
A.
We found that firstly women were more satisfied in their interaction with the police in areas where local government leaders were women. Secondly, not only the number of recorded crimes but also the number of arrests for crimes against women was higher under women leaders. Both facts suggested that the police were being more responsive to crimes against women.
Based on nationwide surveys, we found that people do think that having influential people, such as their local government leader, on their side makes the police more responsive to their concerns when they go to the police station. All of this led us to conclude that the observed increase in official crime data was in fact good news, driven by greater reporting and recording of crimes rather than an actual increase in crimes against women.
Q.
The magazine Tehelka reportedthat many police officers have insensitive attitudes toward rape victims. What does your report say about this?
A.
I am not surprised by this finding. In fact, this is consistent with the findings of a study on the police force in Rajasthan, which we cite in our paper. Only about half the cases of rape were documented by the police, whereas over 90 percent of crimes such as burglary were likely to be reported.
Q.
Anything else you found interesting in the study?
A.
It was interesting to us that women political representatives had more of an effect on crime outcomes at the lowest rungs of government, where women victims have the greatest proximity or access to them. And this is despite the fact that women political representatives have no official authority over the police. Law and order falls under the control of state governments, not the local government. All this suggests that women leaders and representatives have an effect because women find in them someone who is sympathetic to their concerns and able to get the police to be more responsive.
Q.
I took a look at the latest crime bureau statistics and found that states, like Kerala, typically considered better places for women to live in, reported the highest crime rates against women. Does your study explain some of that phenomenon?
A.
Again, this is consistent with our findings. We do find that in districts with higher literacy, having a woman leader increases the documented crimes against women. It is quite plausible that educated women are better equipped or empowered to report crimes committed against them. And that law enforcement officials take them more seriously.
Q.
What benefits in the long term can women expect from quotas?
A.
Over the long term, political representatives could give women a better platform to have their voice heard in terms of what they expect from the governance process. We do find that over the long term, places that have had longer exposure to women leaders more often see a downturn in crime rates. Women leaders could be creating a virtuous cycle on crime outcomes because greater responsiveness of the police would encourage more women victims to come forth and hence deter crime over the long term.
Other related research has found that women tend to attend meetings more often and speak up during them when there are women leaders. Political representatives could also encourage more women to stand for public office and participate in politics. Women leaders could be role models for the younger generation.

HEADLINE: It's the Accounting, Stupid

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Current economic measurements allow industries to position themselves in the best light and fail to account for unpaid work, environmental damage and other powerful influences on the economy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
When I was a student, my English-major friends warned me that economists were people who didn't have enough personality to become accountants. It seemed like a terrible accusation at the time. Today, I worry less about the personality than the efficacy of both professions. 
The accounting systems we currently have in place are seriously flawed. Glaring omissions related to off-balance-sheet entities contributed to major meltdowns in the private sector of the economy in 2001 and 2007. Our national income accounts are full of similar holes. 
A recent report from Demos summarizes longstanding concerns: Official calculations of gross domestic product ignore unpaid work, count spending on education as a form of consumption rather than investment and pretend that depletion of natural-resource stocks, pollution and global climate change are irrelevant to our economic scorecard. 
Many smart economists have offered creative ways of addressing these problems. Progress on the technical front was particularly striking at the recent coordinated meetings of the International Association for Research in Income and Wealth and the National Bureau of Economic Research Conference on Research on Income and Wealth in Cambridge, Mass.
New findings relevant to national income accounting ranged from estimates of the value of household production and human capital to measures of environmental damage and sustainable development.

If these efforts represented nothing more than an exercise in intellectual innovation, we could just enjoy the sport. But national income accounting represents the scorecard of a very high-stakes game in which the current winners hate the very mention of any changes that might reduce their advantage. 
Consider, for instance, Republican insistence that environmental regulation of the coal industry is destroying jobs and weakening recovery from the recession, a political issue that could prove influential in the coming presidential election.
The coal industry has a long history of significant political investments in efforts to avoid explicit economic accounting for environmental damage. In an article published in 1995, Clifford Cobb, Ted Halstead and Jonathan Rowe depict a congressman from the coal-rich state of West Virginia explaining fierce political opposition to measurement of effects of resource depletion and air pollution because somebody might say "that the coal industry isn't contributing anything to the country."
Those words proved remarkably prophetic. In an article published last year in the American Economic Review, the economists Nicholas Muller, Robert Mendelsohn and William Nordhaus mobilized considerable evidence that air pollution damages from coal-fired electricity generation, measured primarily in terms of health effects like premature mortality, exceeded the value added of the industry in 2002. As Paul Krugman has pointed out, the study illustrates the huge gap between market prices and social costs. 
It also establishes a framework for measuring gross external damage, which should be subtracted from measures of value added to arrive at a measure of net value added. In principle, such measures could be extended to analysis of other forms of damage to human and social capital. Imagine hearing about total gross external damage as well as gross domestic product on the evening news. 
Don't assume that the news is always bad. In a recent update of this accounting framework, presented at the meetings described above, Nicholas Muller showed that gross external damage from air pollution shrank between 2002 and 2008. Both environmental regulation and price-induced shifts to less-polluting energy technologies contributed to damage reduction. In other words, the economy performed better over this period than conventional measures suggest. 
Unfortunately, most Americans continue to think of "the economy" in terms of the market economy -- goods and services that are bought and sold. As a result, many buy into the contention that government spending on education and environmental regulation lowers economic growth. 
Some might argue that the experts doing cutting-edge research on accounting reform are just too nerdy to get the public's attention. The bigger problem lies in resistance to any changes that threaten the short-run profitability of powerful industries. Our political system seems to reward strategic investments in disinformation.
If only we could better account for - and correct - this problem.

HEADLINE: Giants Faced With Whether to Remain in Albany

BYLINE: NATE TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: The Giants have made the New York capital their training camp home since 1996, but are in the last year of their contract with the University of Albany. 

 BODY:
ALBANY - Jerry Jennings, the mayor of Albany, expressed his desire to have the Giants keep their training camp in his city. The Giants have yet to renew their contract with the University of Albany.
"We want them back and I know the university wants them back," Jennings said. "It brings a lot of people in for the summer, and the fan support has been terrific."
The Giants have held their training camp in Albany for the past 16 years, the exception being last year when the N.F.L. locked out its players, leading the Giants, among other teams, to change their training camp schedule.
They held a short training camp at the team's facility in East Rutherford, N.J. The Giants could decide to move their training camp to East Rutherford, where they have an indoor practice field that they lack at the University of Albany.
Jennings makes the argument that Giants' training camp makes Albany a vacation destination for families.
"A lot of people bring their families to Albany to come see the Giants because they had a great season last year," Jennings said.
He also made clear that Albany's economy would be affected if the Giants left. So far, he has been pleased with attendance, saying that the Giants drew more than 5,000 fans on Sunday.
"I see a real difference in the people and I didn't know a lot of them and that's good," he said. "It means they are new to the area and they want to see the Giants."
Giants Not Focusing on Jets Many of the Giants say that winning Saturday's preseason game against the Jets is not their main objective.
The Giants have put their focus on improving their running game, their defensive secondary and their punt and kickoff returns.
Defensive end Justin Tuck and punter Steve Weatherford said the Giants won bragging rights in New York by winning the regular-season game last year that started the team's run to the Super Bowl title.
"At this point in the season everyone is so focused and concentrated on themselves right now," Weatherford said. "Obviously, it's a big rivalry and we'd like to win the game."
Weatherford also acknowledged that a victory over the Jets in Week 16 last year was the team's turning point.
"That is what started the avalanche of wins for us," he said.
Tuck agreed, but said he was not looking back to last season, and not thinking yet about a title defense.
"You can't really think about repeating right now," Tuck said. "It's only the second preseason game, and to be thinking like that is dangerous. We have to think about winning our division."
Barden's Difficult Catches Ramses Barden heard the most cheers from fans during practice Monday. Barden has made an impression with his ability to make difficult catches. He added to his highlight reel Monday, outleaping cornerback Prince Amukamara on a go route and making a one-handed catch against zone coverage. Running back Andre Brown threw a tight spiral for a 10-yard touchdown to receiver Dan DePalma, who jumped over safety Chris Horton for the ball. Tight end Martellus Bennett made two catches on tipped passes.

HEADLINE: Postmates Mobile Delivery App Quickly Speeds Up

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: Postmates, a San Francisco-based mobile delivery service, says it is processing over $100,000 in delivery merchandise each month. 

 BODY:
Postmates, a San Francisco-based mobile delivery service, is growing faster than its bicycle messengers can ride.
In May the company released an application, "Get It Now," and says it is processing over $100,000 in delivery merchandise each month.
"For a company that didn't even exist three months ago, the numbers are great," said Bastian Lehmann, the Postmates chief executive officer and a co-founder. "We can now deliver to all of these places in San Francisco faster than a delivery from Amazon."
Get It Now allows people to order food and merchandise deliveries from their smartphone that are then picked up, paid for and delivered to a person's location by one of the company's 70 couriers.
Mr. Lehmann said Get It Now was processing deliveries from over 1,000 retail and food locations across San Francisco. People can receive deliveries from their local pizza restaurant, Whole Foods or Nordstrom.
Couriers on the service have made more than 20,000 deliveries since May, said Ashley Brown, director of communications and marketing at Postmates. Delivery volume continues to increase by 43 percent each month, she said.
Same-day delivery services like Get It Now were a staple of the technology crash in late 1990s. Service like Webvan, Kozmo and UrbanFetch quickly went bust after running out of money and signaled the last fleeting breath as the tech bubble popped over a decade ago.
But Mr. Lehmann says Get It Now is different. "With the penetration of smartphones, the world has changed, as has the ability to purchase through a mobile device," he said. "Back then, Kozmo delivered things for free, whereas we are charging for delivery and have an algorithm that tries to determine the effort that is involved in delivering a certain product."
A delivery by Get It Now usually costs $5 to $20, depending on the items being purchased and the time of day. Evening deliveries, during peak times, can cost more.
Ms. Brown said the average user who engages with Get It Now is spending $116 a month on the service.
Mr. Lehmann said the company would be "expanding to another West Coast city" soon - although he would not name the city. Postmates also plans to release a free iPad application in the next two months.
Although Amazon has said it intends to offer same-day deliveries, Tom Szkutak, Amazon's chief technology officer, seemed to signal a different goal for the company during its latest second-quarter earnings report. Mr. Szkutak said same-day shipping and delivery is simply not feasible for Amazon on a "broad scale."

HEADLINE: Peregrine Chief Is Indicted in Brokerage Fraud Case

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A federal grand jury indicted Russell Wasendorf Sr., the chief executive of the collapsed brokerage firm Peregrine Financial Group, a month after he confessed to stealing from clients and defrauding banks. 

 BODY:
A month after confessing to stealing from clients and defrauding banks, Russell R. Wasendorf Sr., the chief executive of the collapsed brokerage firm Peregrine Financial Group, was indicted on Monday by a federal grand jury.
The move is the latest development in what prosecutors say was a long-ranging fraud for a prominent figure in the futures industry, which largely consists of money management firms that trade contracts in commodities, currencies and interest rates.
The grand jury, convened in Federal District Court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, indicted Mr. Wasendorf on charges of making false statements to regulators.
"On 31 occasions between about February 2010 and June 2012, Wasendorf caused false reports to be submitted to the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission," Stephanie M. Rose, the United States attorney in Cedar Rapids, said in a statement.
Mr. Wasendorf faces a maximum prison term of 155 years and fines of about $7.75 million, prosecutors said. An arraignment date has not been set.
His lawyer, Jane Kelly, a federal public defender in Iowa, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
Last month, local police in Cedar Falls, Iowa, where Peregrine was based, found Mr. Wasendorf unconscious in his car in the company parking lot after a suicide attempt. He had left a note admitting to embezzling more than $100 million from his clients by falsifying bank statements and lying to regulators. Regulators found a customer fund shortfall of at least $200 million.
Since his arrest on July 13, Mr. Wasendorf, 64, has been held in a county jail. No other Peregrine executives has been charged in the case. Mr. Wasendorf's son, Russell R. Wasendorf Jr., the company's No. 2 executive, has been subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury.

HEADLINE: King Midgets, Moving Prudently Over Road and Page

BYLINE: RONALD AHRENS


HIGHLIGHT: The release of a new history of the supermini, manufactured from the late 1940s through the '60s, was released to coincide with the 22nd year of an owners' gathering. 

 BODY:
Residents of Hermitage, Pa., may have wondered whether a plague of automotive locusts had descended on them over the weekend. The buzzing of tiny engines certainly would have been persuasive. 
Rather, the cacophony was produced by the International King Midget Car Club Jamboree. More than 60 cars and twice as many people shook and rattled over the byways of western Pennsylvania on one of the longest Jamboree drives undertaken in the event's 22-year history. Rain showers on Saturday did not deter the participants, even though there was certainly no outrunning the clouds in cars that topped out at 55 miles per hour. 
According to the Standard Catalog of American Cars, the King Midgets, manufactured in Athens, Ohio, from 1946 to 1969, were marketed as the postwar period's economical and efficient people's car. Fuel economy approached 60 miles per gallon, a chief selling point for the cars, which were frequently shipped to buyers in kit form. 
The supermini's saga is related in "King Midget: The Lost Archives" (PDF), a new book documenting the vehicle's history. The tome, weighing roughly 1 percent of a late-production car's 800-pound curb weight, is accompanied by the reissue of "King Midget: A Historical Scrapbook," first released in 1991. 
Together, the histories relate the slow but deliberate growth of the King Midget and its fan base. Beginning life as a single-seat, open-wheel model after World War II, the King Midget entered what its devotees have described as a golden era in 1951, when the rear-engine car received styling evocative of the Willys-Overland Jeepster, a cloth top and enough interior volume to accommodate a second passenger. Refinements to the single-cylinder, 7.5-horsepower Wisconsin engine, which was also used for irrigation pumps, grain elevators and small tractors, were incorporated. 
What the second series lacked in motive force, it made up in its low weight of 450 pounds and attainable price of $550. Minimal, yes, but that was the point. No factory-built King Midget exceeded 10 feet in length. But the 5,000 examples produced appealed to a group of people who never aspired to own Ford V-8s or Hot Rod Lincolns. 
"All of us saw the ads in Popular Science," Bob Vahsholtz, 76, a club officer who edited the histories, said Sunday in a telephone interview. "We wanted the car so bad, we could taste it." 
Mr. Vahsholtz, of Arroyo Grande, Calif., has three King Midgets in his collection. The Jamboree has never been held farther west than Oklahoma City; Mr. Vahsholtz drove cross-country to the 2012 Jamboree without any of his King Midgets in tow. 
Though not a "clubby" guy, he said, he enjoyed the camaraderie of the International King Midget Car Club, which he described as a "people club." 
King Midgets had virtually no safety features, but Mr. Vahsholtz said no one has been injured participating in the Jamboree. "These cars go slow," he said. "It's awful hard to get hurt."
"We treasure original King Midgets, modifieds, clunkers and reproductions," he added. "All King Midget people are welcome, and we don't compete for anything. We do have driving competitions, hill climbs, drag races and so forth, but it's all in fun and nobody gets trophies." 
Mr. Vahsholtz said two King Midgets in the Jamboree were retrofitted with 3-cylinder engines from Geo Metros from the early '90s. This retrofit would be one of the most daring advances since 1958, when a fake front grille and modest tail fins were introduced in Series Three production. A 12-horsepower Kohler engine was installed after 1967, when Detroit's muscle cars were attaining gorilla power. 
Mr. Vahsholtz cautioned against underestimating the visceral thrill afforded by such relatively underpowered cars. "These King Midgets sit and vibrate and spit and sputter, and people love them," he said.

HEADLINE: The Heartache of the Migrant Nanny

BYLINE: FRANCESCA SEGRè


HIGHLIGHT: My gratitude as an ex-pat to my live-in nanny pushed me to recognize the agonizing realities of life for many domestic workers abroad. 

 BODY:
The freelance reporter and mother Francesca Segre was an employer of a domestic worker in Singapore until two weeks ago, when she moved back home to California. Today she is cheering the Convention, knowing that domestic workers, who are often mothers themselves, need every bit of recognition and protection they can get. What follows are her thoughts based on her personal experiences: 
To have a live-in nanny, cook and housekeeper is not a fantasy in Singapore, it's a reality. On this modern island nation, one in every five families employs a migrant domestic worker, including our ex-pat American family of four.
Singapore is a 'maid economy' -- a place where the government welcomes hundreds of thousands of women from poor countries in so that professionals in the formal labor sector are freed up to work long hours and pump up the country's gross domestic product. Luz , a reserved, intelligent 34-year-old Filipina from a poor farming family, moved into our high-rise apartment two years ago. One of nine children, not yet married, and with no jobs in her village, she tells me she decided to leave home rather than continue to help at her widowed mother's grocery stall.
Thoughtful and organized, she was a wonder in our home. She toilet-trained our son when he was one and a half, taught herself American-style cooking, and cleans to meet her standards, which far outshine my own. Careful, calm and hard working, she was, and is, a role model.
At first I felt guilty for all she did. Then I became grateful, not just for how she helped us, but for basic elements of my own family life. Hard work, low pay and heartache are built into the jobs of migrant domestic workers. As a mother to two young children, it is the heartache that rattles me most.
Luz didn't leave children at home, but many maids do. Women from countries like the Philippines and Indonesia come to the agonizing realization that they must work abroad if they want to provide adequate food, education and health care for their families. In the Philippines, for example, jobs are scarce and a mother can earn multiples more working abroad than at home. In Singapore, the average salary for a domestic worker is $300 a month, in American dollars. They'd be lucky to make a third of that for the same job in the Philippines. 
Rosalyn, 39, who lives in my Singapore neighborhood, has been apart from her own children for seven years. She told me she pays an aunt in the Philippines to raise her children, ages 4, 11 and 14. "The first time I went away, I cried every night," she says. "I still have the instinct of a mother. If they are sick, I am not there to hug them." It breaks her heart to hear them cry on the phone, she says. 
When, days after I talked with Rosalyn, my own 4-year-old daughter woke crying in the night with a painful ear infection, I felt the luxury of comforting my own child. That night, I held my daughter tight and wept into her hair for the mothers who must choose between supporting or soothing their children.
As if the heartache of leaving a child behind isn't wrenching enough, these migrant women are often treated as lower-class citizens when they arrive in Singapore. When we first moved here, we were shown apartments for rent, and told that the claustrophobic bomb-shelters off the kitchens could be used for "storage or for a maid's room." Domestic workers are virtually the only workers in Singapore who aren't legally entitled to a day off (yet). And some bosses keep their employee's salary 'for them.' Over dinner one night, Luz revealed that her previous employer kept her passport, work permit and cellphone, ensuring that even if she wanted to leave, she couldn't. That same employer had her eat alone on separate cutlery. They hadn't given her enough to eat -- for years. 
Returning home after years of working abroad can be crushing. These nannies must say goodbye to an employer's children on whom they have heaped their pent-up love for their own families. We're moving back to the U.S. soon, and lately I've noticed Luz hugging my children more often and longer. She wants more pictures with them, too. And when married nannies finally do go home, they find husbands and fathers have often disappeared in their prolonged absence. Perhaps more upsetting is returning to children who believe they have been abandoned while mom has been working abroad. Sociologists call this phenomenon a 'care gain' for the employers of nannies, and a 'care drain' on the families back home.
Yet dreams and desperation keep women coming to Singapore and other maid economies globally. Sally, a friend's domestic worker, left the Philippines when her son was 3 and didn't see him again until he was 6. Her son's father vanished in her absence. But in those three years, she's earned enough to pay for her son's schooling and to buy a house in Manila which she rents out - things she says she never could have afforded had she stayed put. Despite the heartache, she stands firm that leaving home was the best choice for her son's future.
Employing Luz has been an incredible help. Having her in our home has also meant playing a part in the complex web of forces that push women to leave their own families and work for another. Labor migration, I have come to believe, is not clearly good or bad. It is a risky stop-gap measure to stave off poverty with the potential to break free from it.
Since I haven't figured out how to create enough decent jobs in developing countries so women can stay in their home country and support their own families, I have done what I can to help Luz. Like other employers, we have paid for her to go to schools like aidha, which teach domestic workers financial management and leadership. We have lent her funds to start a rice business back home. And we remind her, as constantly as she reminds us, how capable she is.

HEADLINE: Tea Party Hopes to Gain Larger Stage in Election With Romney's Pick

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Paul D. Ryan is now unquestionably the face of the Tea Party caucus in Washington, and his success is certain to embolden House lawmakers whose proudly unyielding approach to governance has contributed to legislative gridlock. 

 BODY:
For two years, Tea Party lawmakers in the House have been the stubborn barbarians at the gate, strong-arming their often reluctant Republican colleagues by refusing to compromise on spending, taxes, debt or social policy.
But Representative Paul D. Ryan's ascendancy to the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket is a signal event for a movement that counts him as one of their own. If Mitt Romney wins in November, a Tea Party favorite will be a heartbeat from the Oval Office.
More than that, Mr. Ryan is now unquestionably the face of the Tea Party caucus in Washington, and his success is certain to embolden House lawmakers whose proudly unyielding approach to governance has contributed to legislative gridlock.

Once considered a fringe of the conservative coalition, Tea Party lawmakers are now indisputably at the core of the modern Republican Party.
"Governor Romney's selection of Congressman Paul Ryan is an excellent choice and a game changer for the presidential election," Representative Kevin Brady of Texas said in a statement. "It's now a campaign of ideas on how best to get this economy moving again, balance the budget and restore America."
He added: "My guess is that Barack Obama has a sick feeling in his stomach today."
For Mr. Romney, the choice has quickly helped to validate him in the eyes of skeptical Tea Party members in the House. Many in the movement had worried that a President Romney would hardly be an ally for their legislative goals.
Choosing Mr. Ryan eases those concerns even as it signals a shift in the movement's balance of power.
"Selecting someone like Paul Ryan, who is so popular with Tea Party activists, proves that Mitt Romney is committed to addressing the economic issues that have been troubling our nation for the last four years," Amy Kremer, the chairwoman of the Tea Party Express, the movement's largest political action committee, said in a statement.
Mr. Romney's emergence as the presumptive Republican nominee earlier this year raised questions about whether Tea Party supporters would find themselves marginalized in an election season dominated by the party's establishment.
In fact, the movement has expanded. Tea Party voters in Texas helped the Senate candidate Ted Cruz defeat David Dewhurst, the state's lieutenant governor. In Indiana, the Tea Party ousted the veteran Senator Richard G. Lugar. And in Wisconsin, activists helped Gov. Scott Walker survive his recall election.
At a Wisconsin Tea Party rally last month just before the recall, Mr. Ryan stood in solidarity with the movement as he urged its members to unite behind Mr. Walker. "The nucleus of our society, of our economy? It's not government. It's us. It's we the people. It's the individual," he said. "The whole country is watching."
Mr. Ryan, in his speech accepting the role of Mr. Romney's running mate, said he had reached across the aisle to find solutions that are workable to members of both parties.
"I have worked closely with Republicans as well as Democrats to advance an agenda of economic growth, fiscal discipline and job creation," Mr. Ryan said.
But his success may help to harden the political impasse in Washington between Democrats and Republicans, and between the House and the Senate. A huge postelection debate is looming over the fate of the Bush-era tax cuts and entitlement spending, issues on which Mr. Ryan has been urging Tea Party members to stand firm.
If Republicans win the White House in the fall but fail to take the Senate from the Democrats, Tea Party members in the House may see even less reason to compromise on their drive to make the federal government smaller.
"Congressman Ryan wants the same thing we do: to pass pro-growth policies and shrink the size and scope of government," said Chris Chocola, president of the Club for Growth, an anti-tax group. "No one understands the dire consequences we face by continuing to ignore our spending problem better than Congressman Ryan, and no one can do a better job of articulating a vision of how to fix it."
Within the Tea Party caucus, Mr. Ryan is not the most absolutist. He voted for the bailout of big banks known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, at the end of President George W. Bush's second term. And he voted for the bailout of the auto industry. Both actions are anathema to some Tea Party lawmakers. And in some ways, he is not the Tea Party archetype. A six-term congressman who has worked in Washington his entire career, Mr. Ryan is an insider-type politician who works from within the system, not against it.
But as chairman of the House Budget Committee, Mr. Ryan has resisted pressure from some in his party's leadership to compromise with the Obama administration in the interests of a grand bargain that many Tea Party members see as selling out.
And his far-reaching budget plans have attracted Tea Party support for the same reason that they have generated such fierce Democratic opposition: because they would go so far in reshaping the country's longstanding fiscal obligations.
President Obama's campaign released a 90-second video attacking Mr. Ryan on Saturday. The video uses an old clip of the newly minted vice-presidential candidate bragging that "I put out a very comprehensive plan rewriting the health care system, Medicare, Social Security, our entire tax system."
The Democrats intend that as an attack, but for Tea Party members it is a de facto mission statement.
Three years ago, the Tea Party movement emerged as a vehicle to protest Mr. Obama's health care legislation. Members followed up with a wave of political victories in the 2010 midterm elections that gave the movement a strong - if not always organized and coherent - voice in Congress.
Now, Mr. Ryan's place on the national ticket testifies to the staying power of the Tea Party ideology and provides a single person around which the movement can coalesce. When he delivers his remarks at the Republican National Convention in Tampa this month, Mr. Ryan will be speaking for the Tea Party as much as anyone else.
Tea Party activists are still likely to make some mischief at the convention, just as some of the movement's lawmakers in the House Republican caucus will no doubt find reasons to fault Mr. Ryan.
But every movement needs someone to help it focus. For the Tea Party, Mr. Ryan appears to be that man.

HEADLINE: For Ryan's First Solo Outing as Candidate, a Soapbox Appearance at the Iowa State Fair

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Paul D. Ryan's first outing alone as the Republican vice-presidential candidate he has chosen a particularly exposed high-wire appearance: a political soapbox at the Iowa State Fair. 

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Representative Paul D. Ryan is going solo, and for his first outing alone as the Republican vice-presidential candidate he has chosen a particularly exposed high-wire appearance: a political soapbox at the Iowa State Fair.
Mr. Ryan, who parted ways with Mitt Romney in Milwaukee on Sunday evening after two days of joint campaigning, will appear Monday afternoon at a locale famous for unscripted give-and-takes with skeptical voters.
A year ago, Mr. Romney was challenged by the crowd at the Iowa State Fair and blurted out, "Corporations are people, my friend," a line that came to haunt him. 
The soapbox, on the Grand Concourse, is sponsored by The Des Moines Register. By tradition a candidate gets 20 minutes to speak and often takes questions from the crowd. Mr. Ryan, who excels at town-hall-style events in which his mastery of policy is on display, will have the opportunity to show his grace under pressure.

Last year, while still just one of many Republican contenders, Mr. Romney was aggressively challenged on his assertions about Medicare, Social Security and taxes. A heckler shouted a remark about corporations. "Corporations are people, my friend," Mr. Romney replied. "Of course they are. Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people."
The lines achieved YouTube immortality and were repeated by critics to show Mr. Romney's supposed indifference to the little guy. 
It was also one of rare events at which Mr. Romney took questions from an audience not composed of supporters controlled by his campaign. 
On Saturday, Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa said he would escort Mr. Ryan around the fair. Most of the state's Congressional candidates are scheduled to speak on the soapbox this week. Tom Vilsack, the United States agriculture secretary, is to speak on behalf of President Obama on Tuesday morning.
While Mr. Ryan is from a neighboring state, Wisconsin, he is one of the few leading Republican figures who has rarely visited Iowa. When asked last year why he was a stranger, he said he didn't want to raise suspicions about his own political intentions. 
Mr. Obama will also be in Iowa on Monday, beginning a three-day visit that will take him to many communities in the battle ground state - but so far, not to the State Fair soapbox.

HEADLINE: Picturing the Remnants of Anti-Chinese Violence

BYLINE: DAVID W. CHEN


HIGHLIGHT: The photographer Tim Greyhavens has documented the modern sites of historic anti-Chinese violence in the United States long ago, challenging his audience to draw the connections from past to present. 

 BODY:
Many people try to pay homage to historic sites by preserving or taking stock of whatever remains. Tim Greyhavens, a photojournalist from Seattle, wants to highlight a slice of history by challenging his audience to fill in the blanks.
For a new online project, Mr. Greyhavens pinpointed, based on records and interviews, the locations of dozens of anti-Chinese incidents in the American West that occurred more than 100 years ago. After traveling to those locations, he then photographed whatever exists there now.
The exhibit offers an entry point into a little-known and ignominious chapter of ethnic cleansing in American history that, viewed more than a century later, seems stunning for the sheer breadth and brazenness of racially motivated violence.
From the mid-1800s until the early part of the 20th century, towns up and down the Western Seaboard, stretching into Wyoming and Colorado, lashed out against Chinese immigrants by rounding them up, often at gunpoint, and kicking them out. Dozens were killed and injured, and houses were set on fire.
Sometimes, the aggressors - who included mayors, judges and businessmen - acted out of economic fears. Sometimes, they acted out of cultural fears. But the Chinese also fought back, filing lawsuits and organizing boycotts, among other means. Yet much of that history is now largely unknown, even in the places where the violence transpired.
But instead of depicting that violence, Mr. Greyhavens opts for a minimalist approach. There are no people in his photos. No historical markers noting that thousands of Chinese immigrants were expelled or killed. Just frame after frame of seemingly mundane rail yards, downtown intersections, industrial zones and more, in the hauntingly titled exhibit, "No Place for Your Kind."
"I wanted these photos to represent that all these people had been removed," Mr. Greyhavens said in an interview. "Here's something where time has passed, and what was there before was just gone. How do you represent something that's not there? And what is there that can possibly be visually interesting, especially in these dull urban landscapes?"
Mr. Greyhavens began his project in 2008, when he stumbled upon a reference to a place called "Chinese Massacre Cove" in Hells Canyon along the Oregon-Idaho border. After reading up on the events, he began to "notice parallels between what happened then. and what is taking place in our country right now," he explains in the exhibit. "Both periods are marked by a widespread lack of understanding of other cultures."
The project's name comes from a newspaper article from the time, describing one of the incidents. A map of the Western United States serves as an index, allowing viewers to click specific locations and read short historical summaries.
The clearest juxtaposition between past and present is his entry for Eureka, Calif., which offers images from 2011 and 1885 of Eureka's former Chinatown. Mr. Greyhavens's favorite photo, perhaps, depicts the only surviving home from a former Chinatown in Rock Springs, Wyo. Tensions between white and Chinese mine workers at the Union Pacific coal mine led to the destruction of 79 homes owned or occupied by Chinese.
"There is nothing about that picture that says, 'Oh, I want to live there, even now,' " said Bob Nelson, museum coordinator of the Rock Springs Historical Museum, who assisted Mr. Greyhavens. "It just needs to be recognized, so it never happens again. People knew about it here, and they're embarrassed, and I think they're trying to atone."
Mr. Greyhavens based much of his research on "Driven Out: The Forgotten War Against Chinese Americans," a 2007 book by Jean Pfaelzer, a professor of English, women's studies and East Asian studies at the University of Delaware. And when asked to review Mr. Greyhavens's exhibit, Ms. Pfaelzer applauded his efforts as earnest and dogged. But she noted that Mr. Greyhavens largely neglected what she felt was a crucial part of the Chinese-American experience at that time: their resistance to, and in some cases, striking legal victories as a result of, the violence.
"On the one hand, it is very powerful to bring place from the past into the present," she said. "But the present can only hold history if it is somehow revealed. That, to me, remains his challenge."
John Kuo Wei Tchen, an historian at New York University who is a founder of the Museum of Chinese in America, said that Mr. Greyhavens's endeavor represents the latest effort in recent years to capture a slice of history that has largely been erased, or forgotten. Indeed, he is now the chief historian for an exhibit on the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 that is scheduled to open at the New-York Historical Society in April 2014.
"I think it's really terrific that this guy did this, and that he is mapping all these spaces that seem totally mundane," he said. "The tricky part is that most people don't know about the violence, and they don't know the actual stories."
Mr. Greyhavens is amenable to updating the project, based on additional research and suggestions. "It's something that can definitely be never-ending," he said.
But he is already thinking about what's next: looking at the social and economic effects of the Grand Coulee Dam on local American Indian tribes, with a focus on the inundation of burial sites and ancestral fishing grounds.
Hells Canyon, Ore.
Chinese Massacre Cove
One of the worst crimes in Oregon history took place here in May 1887. There are conflicting accounts of exactly what happened, but the following is known to be true: a group of at least 31 Chinese miners were camped on the river when a small group of white men surrounded them and opened fire. All of the miners were killed.
The site of the massacre is isolated, and the killers might have gotten away had they not thrown the bodies of the Chinese into the river. About two weeks later, several of the bodies washed up on the shores near Lewiston, Idaho, 65 miles downstream.
An investigation by the Chinese Consulate determined that the killers were a band of local horse thieves. Three of the killers left the area before they could be arrested, but another three stood trial several months later. All three men were acquitted.
Denver
The Corner of 19th and Arapahoe Streets
On Oct. 23, 1880, the Rocky Mountain News noted that "the pest of the Pacific Coast is invading the state, forcing men into starvation and women into prostitution." It went on: "California is already in ruin through Chinese labor and now Colorado is threatened with the same disaster."
These diatribes set the background for violence, and a week later, on Halloween, a major riot erupted. There are several accounts of how it started, but most historians agree that it began when a group of three or four drunken white men attacked two Chinese who were playing pool at a saloon on Wazee Street. One Chinese man was hit with a board, but apparently, both men were able to escape.
Soon, an estimated crowd of two or three thousand began throwing bricks and breaking into Chinese stores and homes. The police were vastly outnumbered and were unable to stop the growing violence.
By late afternoon, the Chinese businesses and homes in the area had been gutted.
Rioters broke into a laundry and put ropes around the necks of the owner, Ah Sing, and his worker, Sing Lee. They dragged the men into the streets, where Ah Sing escaped after one or more white citizens persuaded the crowd to stop momentarily.
After Ah Sing got away, the mob, enraged, attacked Sing Lee. He was beaten and kicked, then dragged down the street to the corner of 19th and Arapahoe Streets where a rope was thrown over a lamppost. Sing Lee was hung by his neck, but the rope either broke or came untied. He died about two hours later.
After the violence ended, more than a dozen rioters were arrested, but almost all were dismissed on the grounds of insufficient evidence. The following year, several men were tried for the murder of Sing Lee, but a jury found none of them guilty.
Tonopah, Nev.
Site of the Former Chinese Community
On the evening of Sept. 15, 1903, a group of at least 30 men from the Tonopah Labor Union, a chapter of the American Labor Union, marched into Tonopah's Chinese community and ordered the residents to leave. A few hours later, a smaller group began breaking into every Chinese-occupied house. They pistol-whipped anyone who resisted and ransacked the homes, searching for money and valuables. Many Chinese reported losses of cash, gold and other prized possessions.
Some of the more prominent Chinese merchants were marched out of town and beaten, then left to find their way back. In the morning, it was discovered that one of the merchants did not return. His corpse was found the next day with a deep hatchet wound in his forehead and other wounds on his body. The man, Zhang Bingliang, had lived in the United States for more than 30 years.
Many of the Chinese and several white residents of the town came forth to identify those who took part in the riot, and 17 men were initially arrested. After a preliminary hearing, only six men were charged with assault and murder. They were tried, yet the eyewitness accounts of several Chinese and white men did not convince the jury of guilt.
Rock Springs, Wyo.
The Only Surviving Chinese Home
In the summer of 1885, tensions between the white and Chinese workers at the Union Pacific coal mine in Rock Springs began to escalate. Over the previous five years, at least 300 Chinese had moved into the town, and their presence was resented.
When the white workers went on strike for better wages and working conditions, the Chinese refused to join them. Things worsened when mine owners hired about 150 Chinese workers to replace the striking white miners. The already-simmering racism in the town soon erupted into one of the worst massacres in American history.
On Sept. 2, a fight broke out at a mine, and two Chinese workers were beaten. The mine foreman shut down work, and the white miners went to nearby saloons. By 3 p.m., the owners closed the saloons as well, in an attempt to quell the angry workers - so the drunken crowd spilled into the streets. A mob mentality soon took over.
Since the mines were closed and most of the Chinese miners had gone to their homes. Groups of white men quickly formed and headed to that area. One group of men blocked a plank bridge across Bitter Creek, the quickest means of escape from the rioters. Other groups then moved in from both the east and the west, effectively trapping many Chinese in their homes.
More than two dozen Chinese miners were known to have been murdered, and many were branded, mutilated, dismembered or decapitated. The number of actual dead is thought to be much higher.
The dead bodies of some were carried to the burning buildings and thrown into the flames. Some of the Chinese who had hid themselves in the houses were killed and their bodies burned; some, too sick or lame to run, were burned alive in their houses.
In all, 79 Chinese-owned or occupied homes, valued for official purposes at $147,000, were destroyed.
Issaquah, Wash.
Probable Site of the Chinese Camp
In September 1885, a group of 37 Chinese workers were hired to pick hops on a farm about 15 miles east of Seattle. As soon as they arrived, a group of white and Native American hop-pickers threatened them and ordered them to leave the area. The Chinese refused, and they camped on a small peninsula along what is now Issaquah Creek.
On Sept. 7, at least five white men and two Native American men climbed the fence around the farm and sneaked into Chinese camp. The group fired their guns into the tents of the sleeping Chinese laborers. Three men were killed, and three others were seriously wounded. The shooters escaped, and the remaining Chinese tended their wounded and left the farm the next day.
Several weeks later, three men were arrested for the murders. One confessed and testified at trial against his co-conspirators. Nevertheless, the jury took less than 30 minutes to return a not-guilty verdict for all of the defendants.
Los Angeles
Site of Lynchings, 1871
On Oct. 24, 1871, a mob went rampaging in Los Angeles' Chinatown. The incident began when a policeman tried to stop a gunfight between two groups of Chinese men. When the policeman was wounded, a businessman named Robert Thompson came to his aid. Thompson fired back at the Chinese, and in the ensuing gun battle, he was mortally wounded.
When Thompson died, a crowd attacked Chinese people regardless of their involvement in the earlier gunfight.
Several Chinese barricaded themselves in a building, and some of the attackers climbed onto its roof. They chopped holes in it with pickaxes and fired shots into the building. The Chinese inside tried to escape, but they were captured by the waiting crowd, which now numbered in the hundreds.
At least a half-dozen Chinese were taken to a horse-drawn wagon shop known as Tomlinson's Corral, at the intersection of Temple and New High Streets. The beams of the shop served as a makeshift gallows, and all of the Chinese in the hands of the mob were hanged, some after they were tortured.
When the beams at Tomlinson's Corral could not hold any more ropes, the crowd moved to the intersection of Los Angeles and Commercial Streets. At least another dozen Chinese were hanged or murdered there.
The coroner's report officially listed 19 dead. The next day, the Los Angeles Star newspaper described the Chinese victims as "uncivilized barbarians" who "valued life so lightly." The massacre was described as a "glorious victory for the virtuous people of Los Angeles."
Los Angeles
Site of the Calle de Los Negroes
Months after the event, a grand jury indicted just nine men, all for the murder of a single man, a Dr. Tong. No other charges were brought forth.
After a short trial, two men were acquitted, and seven others were convicted on reduced charges of manslaughter. One year later, the California Supreme Court reversed the verdicts for all of the men. The court ruled that in some of the cases, a Chinese man was allowed to testify in court, which violated an 1863 state law that said no Chinese person could testify against a white man. In the other cases, the court said the indictments failed to explicitly state that the victims had been murdered as required by law, saying that terms such as "shot" and "hanged" were not specific enough.
Unlike incidents in other cities, the massacre and its aftereffects failed to force the Chinese to leave. The investigation and indictments, as weak as they were, had a dampening effect on the racism in the town, and before long, many Chinese businesses and homes in the Calle de Los Negroes were re-established.
Oro Grande, Idaho.
On Feb. 12, 1879, five Chinese miners were murdered at the Oro Grande mining camp in central Idaho. Local officials claimed that Native Americans, members of the Western Shoshone tribe - known as the Sheepeaters, who had lived in the region for many years - were to blame.
The Sheepeaters denied responsibility for the killings, and no evidence ever connected them to the deaths. Years later, some white miners claimed that other whites had killed the Chinese for the small amount of gold they had in their camp.
Still, at the time, the military took advantage of accusations and initiated what became known as the Sheepeater Indian War. The army pursued the Sheepeater people through central Idaho for many months, and in October 1879, the remaining members of the tribe surrendered. They spent the rest of their lives on the Fort Hall Reservation in southeast Idaho.
No one was ever charged with the murders of the Chinese miners.
Butte, Mont.
Buildings From the Original Chinatown
In the 1880s, Butte had a large and active Chinatown. During the nationwide economic downturn of 1884, labor unions in Butte ordered all Chinese residents to leave town - blaming the Chinese for the unemployment problems. Though the Chinese community chose to resist the order, no harm came to them. During subsequent economic downturns, in 1891-92 and again in 1896, the unions promoted a boycott of all Chinese-owned and operated businesses. The latter boycott became increasingly vitriolic.
Fearing for their lives, some in the Chinese community left Butte in 1896-97. However, a significant number of Chinese merchants retaliated, seeking in federal court an injunction to stop the boycott. The case, known as Hum Lay, et. al. v. Baldwin, was heard in the Ninth Circuit Court in Montana in 1898.
Unlike most court cases brought by Chinese immigrants during this time, this court ruled in favor of the Chinese plaintiffs. The unions were ordered to stop the boycott, and the Chinese were awarded $1,750 from the defendants for fees and expenses. Business returned to usual in Chinatown, and there were no further organized actions against Chinese immigrants.
This was a significant legal victory for Chinese immigrants in the United States during the 19th century. It went counter to the prevailing prejudice and bigotry of the times, which in many other cities in the West resulted in violence against local Chinese. After winning their case, the Chinese community in Butte remained an integral force in the town for many years.
Portland, Ore.
Site of the Albina Chinese Community
On March 1, 1886, a group of 30 or more white men entered a camp of Chinese woodcutters just north of the town of Albina, now part of Portland. The white men, who were armed, ordered the Chinese to leave the area immediately.
After escorting the Chinese to the ferry on the Willamette River, the mob went back to Albina and made the same demand the Chinese residents of the town. About 180 men and women were removed from the Albina and East Portland areas and forced to move into the city of Portland, on the west side of the river.
The Portland Oregonian reported at the time that police had questioned the white men involved, who said they "had a hell of a fine time." No arrests were made.
Newcastle, Wash.
General Area of the Chinese Quarters
On Sept. 11, 1885, at least 15 white miners at the Coal Creek Mine near Newcastle, Wash., attacked a group of about 50 Chinese miners. They fired guns into the air and forced their way into the company building where the Chinese lived. They ordered the Chinese outside at gunpoint, then set fire to the building. It was completely destroyed.
The miners lost all of their clothing and personal belongings, but no one was known to be seriously injured. Most of the Chinese miners fled into the woods nearby and did not return. Prior to this, almost all of them had worked at the mine without incident for three years.
Seattle
Site of the Anti-Chinese Riot
In February 1886, an armed mob rounded up most of Seattle's Chinese residents and attempted to force them onto the docked steamer, Queen of the Pacific. The captain of the Queen refused to let anyone on board without a proper fare, so the mob began collecting money.
Meanwhile, Washington's Gov. Watson Squire ordered the ship to stay at the dock while he looked for some resolution. He failed to act, however, and the Chinese were held in a dock warehouse overnight.
By the next morning, the mob's leaders had collected enough money to pay the fares for nearly 200 of the Chinese captives. Having heard abut the recent massacre in Rock Springs, they reluctantly boarded the ship to leave Seattle.
Guarded by the militia, the others walked toward their homes in what is now the Pioneer Square area. The procession was immediately threatened by a large mob, and when deputies tried to arrest the most violent of the agitators, fighting broke out.
During the melee, several shots were fired, and five men from the mob fell to the ground. Upon hearing the gunshots, reinforcements appeared and strengthened the militia's numbers. The casualties were taken to a hospital, where one of them died. Order was eventually restored, and the Chinese were allowed to return to their homes. The governor declared martial law throughout the city.
On Feb. 14, another 110 Chinese left the city on the next steamer. It was understood that if they did not leave, their lives would be in danger.
Six men were later indicted on charges of unlawful conspiracy for their roles in the forced exclusion of the Chinese. After a four-week trial, the jury returned not guilty verdicts for all six men.
Chico, Calif.
General Area of the Lemm Ranch Chinese Cabin
On March 14, 1877, a group of white men shot six Chinese men at point-blank range in a cabin at Lemm Ranch, just outside of Chico. Three died immediately.
Although wounded, a man named Wo Ah Lin feigned death and survived. After the white men left, he tended to the two other wounded survivors and made his way into town for help.
One of the survivors died the next morning, but Wo Ah Lin and another - Ah Shung - eventually recovered. After the murders, several fires were set in Chico's Chinatown, but the residents extinguished those fires.
Weeks later, 29 men were arrested for the murders and the arson. A grand jury dismissed the charges against eight of the men, but four pleaded guilty. A determined prosecutor managed to make arson charges hold against six more, and they were found guilty. This was a rare instance of conviction in a crime against Chinese immigrants.
In 1881, locals demanded pardons for all of the convicted men. California Gov. George Perkins, who previously had declared a legal holiday for the purposes of attending anti-Chinese demonstrations, shortened the sentences of all of the men to the time they had served and they were released.
In 1886, multiple fires broke out simultaneously in Chinatown, and the entire area burned to the ground.
Truckee, Calif.
General Area of the First Chinatown
When the Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, about 1,400 now out-of-work Chinese laborers traveled to Truckee, seeking new jobs building railroads through the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Within a few months, one-third of Truckee's population was Chinese. The Chinatown there was second in size only to San Francisco.
Within a short time, anti-Chinese resentment swelled in the ranks of the white workers of Truckee. For years, there were sporadic incidents of whites beating and stealing from Chinese merchants, but on May 29, 1875, a fire of unknown origin broke out in Chinatown. Soon, the entire area was in flames, and spread to several white-owned businesses, though a volunteer fire brigade prevented it from spreading further.
No effort was made to save the Chinese buildings, which were completely destroyed.
Soon after the fire, a group of white men started a vigilante committee called the Caucasian League. They began to plan ways to rid the town of its Chinese residents. Some League members wanted swifter action than others, and in June, a few attacked several Chinese woodcutters outside of town. They set fire to their cabins, and when the Chinese ran out, the attackers shot and wounded several of them. One of the Chinese men died the next day.
Seven men were arrested and stood trial, but in spite of direct testimony by two of the defendants against the other five, all were acquitted after the jury's nine-minute deliberation.
Not long after moving across the river, fire once again raged through Chinatown, destroying half of the newly built homes and stores.
Frustrated by the resilience and perseverance of the Chinese, the white leaders of Truckee began planning new ways to rid their town of Chinese. In 1885, Charles McGlashan formed the Truckee Anti-Chinese Boycotting Committee, launching a boycott by merchants of any Chinese who comes to them either for employment or for goods, hoping to starve the Chinese out of Truckee. McGlashan's newspaper proclaimed, "Peacefully, orderly, lawfully, let us disperse with every collie slave in the Truckee basin."
As food and other supplies dwindled in their community, many Chinese left town. Records indicate that though the boycott leaders claimed to have rid the town of Chinese, a few remained. In 1886, four months after the boycott was declared a success, another fire burned most of the buildings in Chinatown. Three people were killed.
Pierce, Idaho
The Site of the Chinese Hanging Tree
On Sept. 10, 1885, residents of Pierce, Idaho, were shocked to find storekeeper D.M. Fraser murdered. They immediately suspected Lee Kee Nam, a Chinese merchant who had opened up a store in competition with Fraser. Vigilantes arrested five Chinese men, including Kee Nam and his business partner, and forced the two to incriminate each other.
A week later, the sheriff and a small posse rode out of town with the five Chinese prisoners, intending them to a courthouse 18 miles away. A little outside of Pierce, they were stopped by a band of armed, masked men, who ordered the posse to leave the prisoners and return to town.
A makeshift gallows was created by lashing a pole between two trees, and they hanged all five of the Chinese men on the spot. The newspaper reported that when the sheriff's posses returned to the site, they found that the pole between the trees had broken but had been lashed to a center post, suggesting to them that the Chinese must have been hanged twice before they finally died.
A perfunctory investigation of the original murder took place the following year at the request of the governor, and it concluded that the Chinese were the guilty parties. No one was ever charged with their murders.
San Francisco
Site of the Sandlot
In 1877, an estimated crowd of 5,000 gathered near City Hall to hear speakers campaign for an eight-hour work day and for the nationalization of the railroads. Soon, however, labor organizer Denis Kearney and others began to lash out against the Chinese in the city, blaming them for a lack of jobs and difficult economic times.
As the speeches became more charged with racist language, tempers flared and shots rang out, and there was a riot.
A mob from the sandlot marched toward Chinatown, but the police successfully halted the attack, and within an hour, the marchers began to disperse.
The next day, police battled with a mob trying to block the docking of a steamer carrying more Chinese to the city. Someone started a fire, and when a rioter rushed in to try to cut a fire hose, he was shot dead by the police.
The police then charged the mob of about 1,500 people. When shots were fired at the officers in the lead, the officers returned the fire, killing 4 and wounding 18. The crowd dispersed.
Another mob took battering rams and broke into Chinese businesses in the area south of Market Street. They ransacked the interiors, stole valuables and destroyed everything else. The few rioters who were caught from this mob ranged from 12 to 16 years old.
San Jose, Calif.
Site of the First Chinatown
After the rapid growth of the early 1880s, San Jose made plans to modernize its downtown area. At that time, the Chinese community, which was once on the city's edge, had become surrounded by white-owned businesses. Civic leaders called for the removal of Chinatown and demanded that local businesses only hire white labor or face a boycott.
After the Chinese made it clear that they did not want to move, local anti-Chinese forces reacted. On May 4, 1887, a fast-moving fire destroyed most of San Jose's Chinatown, which, like many urban areas of that time, was built almost entirely out of wood.
There are no reports of deaths or serious injuries from the fire. But arson was widely suspected as the cause, since multiple blazes broke out in a short while.
The San Jose Daily Herald newspaper announced the next day that "Chinatown is dead. It is dead forever." Soon, however, local Chinese merchants started working with white businessman John Heinlen, and together, they made plans to construct a new Chinatown nearby. That area thrived until the 1920s, when the long-term effects of the Chinese Exclusion Act reduced the numbers of residents to a few dozen.
Olympia, Wash.
General Area Where the Expulsion Was Stopped
On Feb. 9, 1886, one day after an anti-Chinese protester in Seattle was killed by militia who were protecting Chinese citizens, agitators in Olympia tried to force the Chinese out of their city. Newspapers reported that a crowd of 20 had entered the Chinese homes and businesses and were notifying the residents that they must leave. When Olympia Sheriff William Billings realized what was happening, he challenged the organizers of the expulsion attempt at the corner of Fourth and Main Streets. When the crowd continued on its business, the sheriff deputized several citizens of the town, and together, they succeeded in stopping the crowd from removing any of the Chinese.
After the sheriff's intervention, the crowd backed down and dispersed. Later, the riot's leaders were arrested, tried and convicted of conspiracy. Though shaken by this event, the Chinese in Olympia kept their homes and businesses, and for many years, a small Chinatown flourished in their city.
In 1997, Washington Gov. Gary Locke, the first Chinese-American governor in the United States, referred to this incident in his inaugural address, recalling that his grandfather lived in Olympia at the time of the riot. He said that the fact that important citizens stood up for the Chinese in Olympia helped his family establish a deep faith in American values.
Tacoma, Wash.
Approximate Site of "Little Canton"
On Nov. 3, 1885, a mob forcibly rounded up most of Tacoma's Chinese residents. Leading the mob were the mayor, the sheriff, a judge and other officials. The mob went to each home in what the white citizens called Little Canton.
When the rioters found someone in a house, they dragged them out. If they did not find someone, they ransacked the place.
The day after the Chinese were forced to leave the city, a fire started in the now-empty homes. All of the homes burned were destroyed.
"The houses were of no value," reported the Tacoma Ledger newspaper, "except to the Chinese."
At least 200 Chinese were forced from their homes at gunpoint. A few wagons were brought to carry any baggage the Chinese could bring with them and provided rides for elderly women and children. The men had to walk the eight miles outside of town to the Lakeview Railway Station.
There are no official records of deaths or serious injuries during the expulsion, though Chinese accounts say two people died from exposure while being held at the train station.
The mayor of Tacoma and other leaders of the expulsion were indicted for conspiring to deny the Chinese their civil rights, but the charges were dropped.

HEADLINE: Swiss Bank Julius Baer to Buy Bank of America Unit

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The Swiss bank has agreed to buy Bank of America Merrill Lynch's private banking operations outside the United States, the latest consolidation move in the private banking industry. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The Swiss bank Julius Baer agreed on Monday to buy the private banking operations outside the United States of Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, in a deal that will increase the European firm's assets under management by 40 percent.
The acquisition is the latest consolidation move in the private banking industry, as firms look to bolster their operations to gain access to the new markets of emerging economies.
As part of this effort, Julius Baer will pay about $882 million for the American bank's international wealth management business outside of the United States. The sale does not include Bank of America's joint venture in Japan, Mitsubishi UFJ Merrill Lynch PB Securities
 In total, the division has about $84 billion of assets under management.
As part of the deal, Bank of America will be given about $246 million of Julius Baer stock, giving the American bank a 3 percent stake in the Swiss firm.
Even so, Bank of America has been shedding overseas holdings, in large part to raise capital. In November, it recorded a gain of $1.8 billion after taxes on the sale of its stake in China Construction Bank. And it sold its credit card business in Canada.
For Julius Baer, the acquisition will increase the bank's assets under management to about $258 billion. Under the terms of the deal, the Swiss firm will oversee up to an additional $74 billion of assets, which primarily come from wealthy clients in developing economies.
"This acquisition brings us a major step forward in our growth strategy and will considerably strengthen Julius Baer's leading position in global private banking by adding a new dimension not only to growth markets but also to Europe," the company's chief executive, Boris Collardi, said in a statement.
Despite the bank's large increase in assets under management, investors reacted negatively to the news. Shares in Julius Baer fell 7.4 percent by the close of trading in Zurich on Monday.
The shareholder response came after the Swiss bank said it would finance the acquisition through existing cash reserves and a $770 million rights offering. The bank said it would raise an additional $257 million for potential future acquisitions and $206 million through hybrid bonds.
The firm also canceled a previously announced $510 million share buyback.
Julius Baer said costs related to the acquisition would total about $320 million, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch would assume about $125 million of costs connected to the deal.
The deal is one of a number of acquisitions by Julius Baer in recent years. In 2009, it bought the private banking unit of the Dutch firm ING for approximately $500 million.
The deal is expected to close by early 2013. Perella Weinberg advised Julius Baer on the acquisition.

HEADLINE: Obama Takes Aim at Ryan in Iowa

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: During his first full day of campaigning since Representative Paul Ryan joined the Republican ticket, President Obama accused the Wisconsin Republican of blocking the farm bill that is meant to help farmers and ranchers. 

 BODY:
1:24 p.m. | Updated COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa - President Obama came out swinging at Mitt Romney's running mate on Monday, accusing Representative Paul D. Ryan of standing in the way of aid to farmers and ranchers who have been hurt by the severe drought.
During his first full day of campaigning since the Wisconsin congressman was tapped as the presumptive Republican vice-presidential nominee, the president targeted Mr. Ryan, who is campaigning solo for the first time since joining the ticket, in Iowa as well.
"I am told Governor Romney's new running mate is in Iowa today," Mr. Obama said to jeers from the crowd of 4,300 gathered in a park here. "He is one of the leaders of Congress standing in the way" of passage of a farm bill. 
The House Republican leadership chose not to bring a long-term, committee-passed farm bill to the floor for a vote before the August recess, fearing a Republican split over spending and farm price supports. The House instead passed a short-term measure which the Senate rejected, saying it was too limited.
In his remarks, Mr. Obama added: "If you happen to see Congressman Ryan, tell him how important this farm bill is to Iowa and our rural communities." His remarks, coming as he opened his three-day bus tour through this state that catapulted his first campaign for the presidency, segued perfectly with the barrage of criticism that his campaign unleashed Monday against the Romney-Ryan ticket.
In fact, at times it seemed as if the Wisconsin congressman was at the top of the Republican ticket instead of Mr. Romney. Mr. Obama's political adviser, David Axelrod, told CBS's "This Morning" that while Mr. Ryan was "a genial fellow," he believed his selection was similar to John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin four years ago, a choice that initially generated much excitement. Mr. Axelrod warned darkly that Mr. Ryan favored policies that would gut Medicare and put a greater burden on the less fortunate.
By the time Mr. Obama appeared at the podium in Council Bluffs - just as the sun came out to lay waste to hopes here that maybe some rain would lessen the effects of the drought that has devastated farmers and ranchers here - Mr. Obama had seized the campaign attacks against Mr. Ryan's budget policies and was running with them.
"This weekend, my opponent chose as his running mate the ideological leader of the conservative Republican agenda," Mr. Obama said. "He is an articulate spokesman for Governor Romney's vision, but the problem is that vision is one which I fundamentally disagree with."
Appearing before Mr. Obama spoke, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack was even more pointed. "Take a look at the Ryan budget," Mr. Vilsack said. "Take a look at what it does to farm families. It destroys the safety net."
The choice of Council Bluffs to launch this week's bus tour is significant not only because Iowa is so critical to the president's re-election hopes, but also because it is just across the Missouri River from Omaha, and in the same television market. With Nebraska's split electoral map, the president is trying to scrape as many votes as he can get. He won the state's second congressional district in 2008, the first time a Democrat did so since 1964, a win that gleaned him one electoral vote in Nebraska to Mr. McCain's four.
The president addressed the drought that has wrecked farm crops, saying he has directed the Agriculture Department to buy up to $150 million of meat and poultry to help relieve farmers and ranchers. The president has been pushing passage of the farm bill, but Democrats and Republicans have been fighting over farm subsidies and food stamp items in the bill.
The Romney campaign issued a statement quickly in response.
"Paul Ryan hails from an agriculture state and supported disaster relief, and the truth is no one will work harder to defend farmers and ranchers than the Romney-Ryan ticket," said Ryan Williams, a campaign spokesman. "After nearly four years of failure, it's no wonder that Barack Obama returns to the state that launched his presidential campaign with nothing more than broken promises and false attacks."
House Republicans were also quick to fire back at Mr. Obama and blamed the Senate for failing to extend a short-term measure they had passed.
"The weak attempt by the White House to manufacture a controversy illustrates the president's desperation to change the subject to anything other than his failures on jobs and the economy," said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio. "The Democratic-controlled Senate left town for August without taking action on a drought aid bill that passed the House with bipartisan support, including the support of Chairman Ryan."

HEADLINE: Everything Wall St. Should Know About Ryan

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Paul Ryan, who voted for the Glass-Steagall repeal in 1999, today says banks should not be too big to fail. And he differs with Wall Street on some other points as well. 

 BODY:
He could be mistaken for a Wall Street banker. Or perhaps a hedge fund manager. Or even a managing director at a private equity firm, like Bain Capital.
Paul Ryan, with his clean-cut Brooks Brothers looks and wonky obsession with spreadsheets, could be just the archetype of a Wall Streeter.
Mitt Romney's new running mate even trades stocks in his spare time. He's a fan of the nation's blue chips: among the stocks he owns are Apple, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, I.B.M., Procter & Gamble, Wells Fargo, Google, McDonald's, Nike and Berkshire Hathaway, according to his latest disclosure filing.
 Mr. Ryan is a disciple of Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman, two figures long associated with free markets.
And he has the support of some powerful backers in finance: his top donors include employees of Wells Fargo, UBS, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. For his 2012 Congressional race, he raised about $179,000 from securities professionals (not a large sum, but certainly the single largest sector that donated money to his campaign).
One of the biggest contributors to his political action committee is from Paul Singer's hedge fund, Elliott Management. And Dan Senor, recently an investment adviser to Elliott Management, was just named Mr. Romney's new adviser. But what does Mr. Ryan think about Wall Street? His views may surprise you.
Mr. Ryan, who voted in 1999 to repeal parts of the Glass-Steagall Act, allowing commercial and investment banks to merge, now appears to be in the same change-of-heart camp as Sandy Weill, the former chief executive of Citigroup, who recently declared that the banks should be broken up.
"We should make sure you can't get too big where you're going to become too big to fail and trigger a bailout," Mr. Ryan said during a meeting with constituents in May in Wisconsin. "If you're a bank and you want to operate like some nonbank entity like a hedge fund, then don't be a bank. Don't let banks use their customers' money to do anything other than traditional banking."
With a view like that, Mr. Ryan faces a challenge winning the support of the likes of Jamie Dimon, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase and a vocal supporter of the big bank model. (Mr. Dimon, a onetime supporter of President Obama, had recently been hinting he could vote for Mr. Romney, regularly calling himself "barely a Democrat.")
Mr. Ryan is also an ardent critic of the Dodd-Frank Act, the postcrisis Wall Street legislation. But, oddly enough, the provision he dislikes the most is the one that has the greatest support of the industry: a tool known as resolution authority, which gives the government the authority to dismantle a failing bank without wreaking havoc on the rest of the system. It was a provision that was supported by the former Republican Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. "We would have loved to have something like this for Lehman Brothers. There's no doubt about it," Mr. Paulson told me two years ago. The provision was also supported almost universally by Wall Street as a way to end the "too big to fail" problem.
Mr. Ryan's 2013 budget proposal sought to remove the resolution authority provision saying, "While the authors of the Dodd-Frank Act went to great lengths to denounce bailouts, this law only sustains them."
It is worth noting that Mr. Ryan voted in favor of the bank bailout in 2008, known as TARP or Troubled Asset Relief Program. Ahead of the vote, he encouraged his colleagues in the House to vote in favor of it to avoid "this Wall Street problem infecting Main Street."
He added: "This bill offends my principles, but I'm going to vote for this bill in order to preserve my principles, in order to preserve this free enterprise system. We're in this moment and if we fail to do the right thing, heaven help us."
While Mr. Ryan may appear to be a friend of business, he doesn't agree with the industry's biggest talking point these days, the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan. He was a member of the commission and voted it down, arguing that it did not go far enough in overhauling health care entitlements.
He later criticized President Obama for not supporting it. That prompted Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council under President Obama, to retort on CNN:
"Paul Ryan, talking about walking away from a balanced plan like Bowles-Simpson is, I don't know, somewhere between laughable and a new definition for chutzpah."
Oddly enough, Erskine Bowles, a Democrat, praised Mr. Ryan's proposed budget in a speech in 2011, saying, "I always thought that I was O.K. with arithmetic, but this guy can run circles around me."
Mr. Ryan also bucked the conventional Wall Street wisdom on how to deal with the debt ceiling. Many investment managers are wringing their hands about the uncertainty that the debate over the "fiscal cliff" is creating for markets. Last year, three months before the debt ceiling debate reached a peak, Mr. Ryan said that he was prepared to let the government default on its debt for at least several days if it would force Democrats to accept deeper cuts.
"They all say, 'Whatever you do, make sure you get real spending cuts,' " Mr. Ryan told CNBC about the way investors, including the hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller, wanted him to vote. "Because you want to make sure that the bondholder has the confidence that the government's going to be able to pay them. You're putting the government in a better position to pay them."
James Pethokoukis, a columnist for the American Enterprise Institute, which has traditionally supported Mr. Ryan, sent this Twitter message in April. "I hear what G.O.P. support there was for Obama/Bowles/Simpson debt panel plan is collapsing thanks to Ryan Plan."
So while financiers may cheer Mr. Ryan's pro-market policies, they may want to reassess just what those policies mean for their businesses.

HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney naming Representative Paul D. Ryan as his vice-presidential choice could make Mr. Ryan's home state of Wisconsin a much closer contest. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's decision to name Representative Paul D. Ryan as his vice-presidential choice not only throws Mr. Ryan into the campaign grinder, but also adds his home state, Wisconsin, into the mix. 
Wisconsin has had something of a "to be, or not to be" swing-state status during this year's race. The state has been treated as both a genuine tossup and a lock for President Obama. Before Mr. Ryan was named to the ticket, the FiveThirtyEight model saw the state closer to the latter: Mr. Romney had just a 12 percent chance of carrying the Badger State. But the Ryan pick boosted that to 20 percent.
Those improved odds are based on a two percentage point bonus that the model accounts for in the home state of each vice-presidential candidate -- the average bump that a running mate has added since 1920, according to a previous FiveThirtyEight analysis.
But the effect a vice-presidential candidate has had on his or her home state has varied widely. Is there any inherent aspect to Wisconsin's political geography that might provide clues as to whether Mr. Ryan will have a larger, or smaller, impact on the Nov. 6 vote in Wisconsin? 
Wisconsin is a deeply polarized state (see, Walker, Scott). But that is fitting -- the state helped give rise to both the Republican Party in 1854 and the progressive movement, through former Wisconsin Gov. Robert La Follette Sr., who was born one year later in 1855. A century or so ago, when the progressive movement and the Republican Party were close cousins, Wisconsin was a reliably red state. (It voted for the Democrat in the presidential race just twice between 1856 and 1928.) Now that these are viewed as incompatible philosophies, their sharp edges manifest themselves in different ways throughout the state.
The suburban communities to the immediate west of Milwaukee are the Republican power centers in Wisconsin. Waukesha County, in particular, has some of the most heavily Republican suburbs in the nation.
Mr. Ryan represents the First District, to the south of Milwaukee. Previously, the First District included just a small part of those suburbs, but a larger chunk of that Republican territory was added to Mr. Ryan's district in the most recent round of redistricting, Mr. Franklin said.
Nevertheless, Mr. Ryan has not represented an overwhelmingly conservative district. It has leaned slightly to the right, but Mr. Obama was able to carry the First District in 2008, albeit, with just 51 percent of the vote. Winning a district doesn't earn you any points if you lose the state, but Mr. Ryan's ability to win easily in a not-so-easy area suggests that he has some skill in winning over a skeptical audience -- at least in Wisconsin.
Both Gov. Scott Walker and Mr. Obama have net positive approval ratings in Wisconsin. That suggests that there is a group of true independent voters in the state, who can be influenced to vote for either Mr. Romney or Mr. Obama, Mr. Franklin said. 
That's exactly where Mr. Ryan might be able to help Mr. Romney in Wisconsin, Mr. Franklin said. While nationally, the opinion of independent voters who have heard of Mr. Ryan is about evenly split, his ratings are respectable among Wisconsin independents. 
It is unlikely, however, that Mr. Ryan's Wisconsin roots will be enough to win over many Democrats in America's Dairyland, Mr. Franklin said.
The Democratic anchors in Wisconsin are the cities of Milwaukee and Madison. As both the state capital and home to the main branch of the state's university system, Madison is especially Democratic. The farming counties in western Wisconsin, along the Mississippi River, also tend to vote Democratic, and voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 -- perhaps a testament to their progressive heritage, despite demographics (white, rural and working class) that would be problematic for Democrats in most other contexts.
The two regions of Wisconsin that are harder to predict are the Fox River Valley, north of Milwaukee, and the sparsely populated farm counties in the northwest. 
Northern Wisconsin and the Fox River Valley, near Green Bay, are also mostly white and working class. Employment is centered around agriculture and paper mills. Mr. Obama did surprisingly well in both regions in 2008. But often, their traditional Republicanism prevails: George W. Bush won almost every county in these regions in both 2000 and 2004. 
Mr. Obama's unexpected strength in the Fox River Valley and northern Wisconsin in 2008 helps to explain how he easily carried the state after razor-thin margins in the past two presidential cycles. The Obama campaign managed to flip a large swath of the state.
The Bellwether: Columbia County
Columbia County may provide some early clues as to how Wisconsin might vote on Nov. 6. It sits just north of the liberal Dane County, home to Madison, but is also not too far removed geographically from the heavily Republican Milwaukee suburbs, or the red-tinged Fox River Valley.
The vote in Columbia County has matched the statewide vote within one or two percentage points in each of the past three presidential elections. It has also mirrored the statewide vote in off-year election cycles.
The Bottom Line
A Public Policy Polling survey from early June found Mr. Obama leading Mr. Romney by six percentage points in Wisconsin. But the poll also found that an Obama-Biden ticket led a Romney-Ryan paring by just one percentage point, 47 to 46 percent.
But that is just one data point. Outside of his own district, Mr. Ryan is still fairly unknown, even in Wisconsin. In a July Marquette University poll, 35 percent of Wisconsin voters said they did not know enough about him to render a favorable or unfavorable verdict. That percentage is just slightly lower than the share of people who have never heard of Mr. Ryan nationally.
As a member of the House rather than a statewide officeholder, Mr. Ryan's relative obscurity makes predicting his effect on the election more difficult. How an independent voter in Green Bay responds to Mr. Ryan, including his controversial proposal to remake the federal budget, may not be all that different from a how an undecided voter responds in Manchester, N.H. or Lakeland, Fla. It's possible that Mr. Ryan could provide an average home-state bounce of about two points to Mr. Romney, but it would likely be highly concentrated in his home district, with few obvious gains elsewhere.
Whether Mr. Obama can replicate, or even approximate, his 2008 performance in northern Wisconsin and the Fox River Valley will go a long way toward determining whether he carries Wisconsin again. Republicans may be hoping that Mr. Obama's 2008 support was miles wide, but inches deep.
Wisconsin's economic recovery has also been more sluggish than other states in the Midwest. With a sputtering economy hobbling Mr. Obama's re-election effort, and now with Mr. Ryan on the ticket, both northern Wisconsin and the Green Bay region could find reasons to revert to their Republican ways. That would make Wisconsin a much closer contest.

HEADLINE: Aug. 13: Polls Have Middling Reviews for Ryan

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: A few polls were released that were specifically dedicated to Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and they offered mediocre numbers for the Republican ticket. 

 BODY:
This is a another two-for-one column. We'll give you our daily breakdown of the horse-race polls and economic data that came out on Monday. Then, we'll take a quick look at overnight polls that took the temperature of Mitt Romney's new running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin.
Monday's Horse Race
In Missouri, a new SurveyUSA poll put Mr. Romney just one point ahead of President Obama, with 45 percent of the vote to 44 percent. 
This is a fairly poor number for Mr. Romney -- who had led in our Missouri forecast by six percentage points previously -- but not quite as bad as it looks. This is SurveyUSA's first poll of Missouri so far this cycle, but its polls in other states have been a bit Democratic-leaning relative to the consensus. Perhaps more important, Missouri is no longer a state that plays a critical role in the electoral math. Mr. Romney could lose it. (His chances of doing so rose to 18 percent from 15 percent on the new survey.) But he had a reasonably big cushion there from previous polling, and the state will probably only flip to Mr. Obama in the event that he is winning the Electoral College decisively. 
The only potential worry for Mr. Romney is that about half of the interviews in the SurveyUSA poll were conducted after his selection of Mr. Ryan -- but since there are no trendlines for comparison, I don't think we can read too much into that.
Mr. Romney got a better number in a national poll by George Washington University for Politico, which put him one point behind Mr. Obama in the national race. But just as I'm not sure the Missouri poll is that big a deal for Mr. Obama, I don't know that this one is something for Mr. Romney to get too excited about. If you bought into the notion that Mr. Obama was seven or eight points ahead in the national race, as a few polls indicated last week, then this should give you a reality check. However, our model's calculations suggested there was ample reason to be skeptical of those polls, and Mr. Obama's lead over Mr. Romney is likely in the neighborhood of two to three points instead. As compared to that baseline, this is an O.K. poll for Mr. Romney, but not a great one.
Finally, a new poll of New Hampshire, from the University of New Hampshire on behalf of WMUR-TV, an ABC affiliate, gave Mr. Obama a three-point lead there. That's a tick down from their prior poll of the state, when he was up by four points instead. On the other hand, New Hampshire hadn't been polled in some time, and this poll is suggestive that Mr. Obama still holds the lead there. Overall, the survey was very consistent with the forecast that the model was already making in New Hampshire; Mr. Obama's chances of winning the state were roughly unchanged, declining to 72 percent from 73 percent.
A Lull in the Economic News
With all the focus on Mr. Ryan, has everyone forgotten about the economy? We haven't talked much about it much lately, in part because not one of the reports that our forecast uses to measure the economy had been updated recently -- except for the stock market, which has been uncharacteristically steady. (The VIX index, which measures the expected volatility in the stock market, is close to a five-year low.)
But on Monday, The Wall Street Journal came out with its new panel survey of economic forecasts; we use the panel's gross domestic product projections as part of our economic index. Those G.D.P. forecasts were lowered by about two-tenths of a percentage point in forward-looking economic quarters and now project growth of about 2 percent for the next six to nine months, about what it has been in the recent past.
Still, the overall polling and economic picture is basically unchanged. Mr. Obama's chances of winning the Electoral College were 71.4 percent in Monday's forecast, as compared with 71.6 percent on Saturday.
Ryan's Early Reviews
Only a smattering of the horse-race data was conducted after Mr. Romney's announcement of his vice-presidential pick. The SurveyUSA poll of Missouri was one partial exception, but as I mentioned, I don't know that too much should be inferred from it. The national tracking polls also had some of their interviews conducted after the vice-presidential announcement, but they haven't moved much. The race remained tied in the Gallup poll, and Mr. Romney's lead increased to three points from two in the Rasmussen Reports tracker.
However, a few polls were released that were dedicated to Mr. Ryan specifically, and they offered mediocre numbers for the Republican ticket.
An ABC News/Washington Post poll, conducted after Mr. Romney's announcement, found that 38 percent of Americans had a favorable view of Mr. Ryan, and 33 percent had an unfavorable one.
The good news for Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan is that those numbers were improved from polling that ABC News conducted just before the announcement, when 23 percent of adults had a favorable impression of Mr. Ryan and 33 percent an unfavorable one.
But that is countered by two pieces of bad news. First, Mr. Ryan's numbers are middling to poor by the standard of other recent vice-presidential selections. And second, the period immediately after a vice-presidential announcement has often been a high-water mark for the new candidate. More often than not, the candidate's unfavorable numbers increase more than his or her favorables from that point forward.
In the table below, I've provided average favorability ratings for recent vice-presidential selections, as compiled from the Web site PollingReport.com. 
There are three sets of numbers in the chart. The left-hand columns show the candidate's numbers before the vice-presidential announcement, based on an average of polls conducted at an earlier point during that election year. Unfortunately, we could only find data on pre-announcement polling for two candidates, Joe Biden in 2008 and John Edwards in 2004.
The middle columns reflect an average of surveys in the two weeks immediately after the running-mate announcement. Finally, the right-hand columns show an average of polls from October and November, just before the election.
The five candidates in the table -- we don't list numbers for Dick Cheney in 2004 since he was already a known commodity to voters -- averaged a 45 percent favorable rating and a 19 percent unfavorable rating in the post-announcement period. Mr. Ryan's numbers from the ABC News poll are not so good as compared to these: his favorable ratings are lower than any of the other five candidates, while his unfavorable numbers are higher.
By October and November, these candidates' numbers had declined somewhat on balance. Their favorability rating increased just slightly, to 46 percent from 45 percent. But their unfavorables rose more, to 27 percent from 19 percent.
If, hypothetically, the change in Mr. Ryan's numbers matched the historical pattern, that would give him a 40 percent favorable rating but a 41 percent unfavorable rating by Election Day. That would make his numbers similar to Sarah Palin's numbers in late 2008. (Ms. Palin is sometimes remembered as having substantially negative favorability ratings in 2008, but they were actually close to break-even; her numbers did not consistently turn negative until after the election.)
But what about the improvement that the ABC News poll showed for Mr. Ryan? From what I can tell, this also seems to be a common feature of the immediate post-announcement period. Although we have only two data points for comparison, both Mr. Biden in 2008 and Mr. Edwards in 2004 also polled much better immediately after their rollout than they had earlier in those years. 
In other words, the numbers during a candidate's rollout seem to be better than those either before or after his or her honeymoon period. 
I also looked up favorability numbers for vice-presidential candidates dating back to 1980 from the CBS News polling database. (Many CBS News polls were conducted in conjunction with The New York Times.) A word of caution: The favorability polls conducted by CBS News and The New York Times are a little bit different than those of other polling firms. The difference is that CBS News and The New York Times actively encourage respondents to say that they have an undecided view of a candidate, or don't know enough about the candidate to have formulated an opinion. This tends to make both a candidate's favorable and unfavorable ratings lower than in polls conducted by other news organizations. I personally like this approach -- some other polling firms are asking voters for their opinions of candidates they know next to nothing about -- but it does mean that the CBS News polls cannot always be compared directly to those of other polling firms. 
Based on the CBS News methodology, candidates averaged a 29 percent favorable rating and an 11 percent unfavorable rating in the first poll conducted after they were announced as the vice-presidential candidate. The weakest numbers belonged to Dan Quayle in 1988, who started out with a 24 percent favorable rating against an unfavorable mark of 18 percent.
By the final CBS News/New York Times poll conducted just before the election, the candidates' favorable ratings had risen to 37 percent on average. But their unfavorable ratings had risen more, to an average of 25 percent. 
So we're getting the same story as from the broader average of surveys: after an initial burst of enthusiasm for the candidate, more of the voters who begin to weigh in on him or her do so with negative views. 
A USA Today/Gallup survey posed a slightly different question to voters, asking them what they thought of Mr. Romney's choice of Mr. Ryan, rather than about Mr. Ryan directly. In that poll, 39 percent of voters rated the choice as "excellent" or "pretty good," while 42 percent called it "fair" or "poor."
These are underwhelming numbers by the standards of this particular question, which Gallup has asked periodically since 1988. The scores for Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan are a bit worse than those for John McCain and Mrs. Palin in 2008, and just slightly better than those for George H.W. Bush and Mr. Quayle in 1988 -- two of the more poorly regarded vice-presidential choices of recent years.
Still, voter preferences on Mr. Ryan are not all that firm yet. Historically, the correlation between a candidate's initial ratings and those he or she eventually winds up with has only been moderate. Mr. Edwards started out with quite strong favorability ratings when he was announced in 2004, for instance, but they were mediocre by Election Day. Hardly anyone initially had a view of Lloyd Bentsen in 1988, but he wound up being a reasonably well-regarded vice-presidential choice. The battle to define Mr. Ryan has only just begun.
Personally, however, I think the smart money is on Mr. Ryan's polling remaining mediocre throughout this election cycle. He articulates his ideas well, but with a somewhat intellectual timbre that might appeal more to high-information voters than those who are less invested in politics and are more likely to be undecided in the race. And he has inherently something of a tough sell, since his policy preferences are reasonably far removed from those of the median voter. Mr. Ryan is also on the young side for a vice-presidential choice, and lacks foreign policy experience, so he may have more work to do than the average candidate in demonstrating his credentials.
Instead, this was a strategic choice by Mr. Romney: an effort to reorient the election toward battle of ideas rather than a personality contest. This was not a pick designed to win over focus groups.
It may be a smart strategy for Mr. Romney or a poor one. My reaction to it has become more tepid as I have read accounts of how the choice was made. The pick of Mr. Ryan seems to have been more a "gut-feel" decision than a data-driven one, and I think the evidence suggests that such a process is more likely to lead to mistakes under conditions of substantial uncertainty.
But whether it turns out well or poorly, we should not expect Mr. Ryan to accomplish something that the choice wasn't designed for, any more than a team that drafts a speedy, slap-hitting center fielder should expect him to miraculously start hitting home runs. If Mr. Romney wanted the candidate with the maximal favorability rating 48 hours after his rollout, he could have gone in another direction with his pick.

HEADLINE: What Paul Ryan Doesn't Offer

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's running mate lacks experience in foreign policy, and in the private sector. 

 BODY:
Anyone who's picked up a newspaper or turned on a TV news program in the last 48 hours knows by now that Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney's running mate, is best known as the very conservative author of a very conservative budget plan, which would cut $6 trillion from federal spending over the next 10 years. Anyone who's ventured below the fold probably also knows that he's a social conservative: He opposes same-sex marriage and has said that he's "as pro-life as a person gets," which seems accurate since he's the co-sponsor of a bill that would grant fetuses "all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood."
That's what Mr. Ryan offers the ticket: Economic and social right-wing bona fides to shore up support among Republicans still suspicious of Mr. Romney, who passed health care reform in Massachusetts and who once said that abortion should be "safe and legal."
Here's what he doesn't offer: Experience in foreign policy or in the private sector.

As Alex Seitz-Wald pointed out in Salon, the Romney-Ryan ticket is the first major party ticket "in at least 50 years without any formal foreign policy or military experience." Mr. Biden was the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Mr. Obama served on that committee, whereas the Republicans can point to no comparable record.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found in July that a majority of voters think the president would be a better commander-in-chief than Mr. Romney, and the latter's V.P. pick may widen that gap. Unless of course the Newt Gingrich strategy prevails: He said on Sunday that foreign policy inexperience is actually beneficial: "I think it is an advantage that they are not part of the current mess."
He may not be part of the current foreign policy mess, but he's certainly part of the more generalized beltway mess: He worked as an aide to Senators Bob Kasten and Sam Brownback in the 1990s, as a speechwriter for Jack Kemp, Bob Dole's running mate, in 1996, and was first elected to the House in 1999. As for non-political employment, Fox News Insider notes that he "worked as a marketing consultant for his family's construction business." He also "moonlighted on Capitol Hill as a waiter at the Tortilla Coast restaurant & as a fitness trainer at Washington Sport and Health Club." That's about it, unless you count his summer job in college "peddling turkey bacon" to supermarkets.
Is there anything inherently wrong with running for high office without substantial private sector experience? No, but Mr. Romney seems to think there is. He's fond of saying (falsely) that the president has "never had a job in the free economy; neither has Vice President Biden." He's even brought up the idea of a constitutional amendment requiring presidents to have worked at least three years in business. By that standard, Mr. Ryan isn't qualified.

HEADLINE: In Massachusetts, Warren Seeks to Link Brown to Romney-Ryan

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Elizabeth Warren says that Paul D. Ryan's budget proposals are so harsh that they will spook voters in Massachusetts into realizing that keeping Senator Scott P. Brown in office would only provide a rubber stamp for a draconian Romney-Ryan administration. 

 BODY:
BOSTON - If President Obama is pleased by Mitt Romney's selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as his vice presidential running mate, Elizabeth Warren is ecstatic.
Ms. Warren, a Democrat challenging Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, says that Mr. Ryan's budget proposals are so harsh that they will spook voters here in deep blue Massachusetts into realizing that keeping Mr. Brown in office would only provide a rubber stamp for a draconian Romney-Ryan administration.
"Scott Brown and the Republicans are doubling down on policies that will hurt seniors, make it tougher for families to educate their children, and leave small businesses struggling," Ms. Warren said in a statement. "The Republican vision of the future is tax breaks for billionaires and repeal of reforms for Wall Street."
At the same time, the Massachusetts Democratic Party released a video in which it seeks to link Mr. Brown with Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan. 
It shows a clip of Mr. Brown saying there is no one he would trust more on the economy than Mr. Romney and another in which he says "thank God" that Mr. Ryan has released his budget proposal. (Mr. Brown initially praised the Ryan budget proposal but ended up voting against it.)
"Brown, Romney and Ryan," reads the tagline of the Democrats' video. "Wrong for Massachusetts."
The Warren-Brown race, already the most expensive in the country, is one of a handful that could determine which party controls the Senate next year.
Mr. Brown has not yet commented on Mr. Romney's selection of Mr. Ryan as his running mate.
But the senator portrays himself as an independent, not as a Republican. He has tried to create some distance between himself and Mr. Romney, though Mr. Romney's campaign is based here and they share some political advisers.
Though a former governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney is trailing in state polls to President Obama, and the relatively popular Mr. Brown needs to keep Mr. Romney from dragging him down here in November.
Mr. Brown was already planning to keep a low profile at the Republican National Convention later this month in Tampa; the expected celebration of Mr. Ryan by conservatives could send Mr. Brown running for cover.

HEADLINE: Ryan Greeted by Hecklers at Iowa State Fair

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Paul D. Ryan received a raucous baptism into public speaking as the vice-presidential candidate, Iowa State Fair-style, when he encountered determined hecklers on his first day of solo campaigning. 

 BODY:
DES MOINES - Representative Paul D. Ryan received a raucous baptism into public speaking as a vice-presidential candidate, State Fair-style, when he encountered determined hecklers on his first day of solo campaigning.
Mr. Ryan was speaking to a generally supportive crowd from an outdoor political soabox at the Iowa State Fair, when protesters gathered in front of him and shouted slogans including "We are the 99 percent!" Two women who tried to climb onstage were hustled away by security officers before they could unfurl a banner.
"It's funny, because Iowans and Wisconsinites, we like to be respectful of one another," Mr. Ryan said to the crowd, many holding "Romney" signs. "These ladies must not be from Iowa or Wisconsin."
A day after parting ways with Mitt Romney following their joint appearance at a giant rally outside Milwaukee, Mr. Ryan's visit here on Monday set off many side debates among audience members over his and President Obama's policies. 
It was illustrative of how Mr. Ryan, a leader of House Republicans who has offered detailed plans to alter entitlement programs and cut taxes, has instantly become an ideological lightning rod in the presidential race.
Two women who followed him as he strolled through the fair argued over his plan to revamp Medicare into a set payment to individuals to buy insurance in the private market, which Mr. Ryan believes will save the program from insolvency.
Video by Mickle Communications for the New York Times
"Vouchers are a cut in Medicare; you just wait, you'll lose money," Midge Slater argued.
"What are you going to do for my two grandchildren when we're broke,'' another woman told her, declining to give her name.
Mr. Ryan's short speech did not address two controversial subjects of concern to Iowans: a farm bill that is a victim of Congressional deadlock; and a tax credit to the wind industry, which Mr. Romney opposes but Iowa's Republican leadership supports.
Instead, Mr. Ryan used his speech to attack Mr. Obama over a ruling that Republicans say would gut the work requirement at the heart of the federal welfare law of 1996.
"The work requirement in welfare reform did more to help the poor than any reform we've had in the last generation," Mr. Ryan said. "And President Barack Obama has just passed a rule waiving those work requirements, saying no longer do states actually have to have work requirements for people to receive welfare.''
The administration has said no waivers will be granted unless a state's program increases the number of aid recipients getting jobs compared to existing programs.
Mr. Ryan's embrace of the traditional role of a vice-presidential candidate as chief surrogate and attack dog seemed a work in progress. His criticism of Mr. Obama was not notably fierce, and his manner was easy-going. He seemed unfazed by the protesters who chanted through much of his speech. He did not argue with them the way Mr. Romney did at the fair a year ago when he said, "Corporations are people, my friend,'' a line critics seized upon.
Mr. Ryan praised Mr. Romney's experience as a job creator in private business and ticked off the five-point plan the Romney campaign has advanced to speed economic recovery.
"We need to stop spending money we don't have," he said. "President Obama has given us four years of trillion-plus deficits. He's making matters worse and he's spending our children into a diminished future."
Mr. Ryan looked comfortable, dressed in jeans, a red checked shirt and scuffed cowboy boots. After stepping out of a black S.U.V., he unclipped his iPhone, in a camouflage pattern case, and handed it to an aide as he walked through the crowds.
Kay Pence, dressed in a frilly costume and calling herself the Tax Cut Fairy, followed along. "If we wish hard enough we can cut millionaires' taxes, raise military spending and balance the budget too," she said.
Accompanying Mr. Ryan were Gov. Terry E. Branstad and Representative Steve King, leading Iowa Republicans.
"You have to see the butter cow here, this is a big deal," Mr. King told him, mentioning one of the century-old fair's most famous attractions, a large sculpture in butter.
Mr. Ryan was unfamiliar with it. "You mean fried butter?" he said.
"No, no," Mr. King said. "This is cultured cow milk."
"Is it a Holstein, Guernsey, Jersey or what?" Mr. Ryan asked.
Mr. King didn't know. "Have you ever seen a butter cow?" he asked the newcomer.
"No I haven't. I've milked a cow though."

While Florida - a state where elderly voters make up 22 percent of the electorate - is a place where Democrats can be counted on to assail proposed changes to Medicare, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan signaled that they intend to go on the offensive, Adam Nagourney writes. They are gambling that they can convince voters that the time has come to confront the mounting costs of entitlement programs.

President Obama and Representative Paul D. Ryan went head to head Monday in an early test of themes that will undoubtedly dominate the campaign in the months to come, Helene Cooper and Trip Gabriel report. They clashed over farm aid, welfare, the unemployment rate and the role of government.

        
While the Romney campaign tried to emphasize Paul Ryan's knowledge of the federal budget as a top reason for selecting him as a running mate, less well-known is the Wisconsin congressman's close ties to the donors and activists who have channeled Tea Party anger into a $400 million political machine, Nicholas Confessore reports. Mr. Ryan could provide Mr. Romney with a bridge to the conservative counterestablishment and access to groups planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to defeat President Obama.

        
The moderating duties for the four presidential and vice-presidential debates will be evenly split between male and female journalists for the first time this year, Brian Stelter reports.

HEADLINE: What Are Paul Ryan's Chances of Becoming President?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Whatever happens this year, Paul D. Ryan is likely to be a major part of the American political landscape for a long time to come. But what are his chances of winning the Oval Office someday? 

 BODY:
On Saturday when introducing his new running mate, Mitt Romney initially referred to Paul D. Ryan as the "next president of the United States." 
Mr. Romney quickly apologized for the slip-up, saying that he hoped that Mr. Ryan would become the next vice president instead. (Apparently, the stress of a vice presidential rollout can take its toll even on relatively unflappable candidates like Mr. Romney; Barack Obama made a similar slip when introducing Joe Biden four years ago.)
Of course, it's not literally impossible that Mr. Ryan could turn out to be the 45th American president precisely (Mr. Obama is the 44th). It just couldn't be through a sequence of events that Mr. Romney would be rooting for. Either the Republican ticket would have to win this year's election -- but with Mr. Ryan, not Mr. Romney, at the top of the ticket. Or, the more likely case: Mr. Obama would need to win the election and serve out his remaining four years, and Mr. Ryan would have to run for and win the presidency in 2016.
What, exactly, are the odds of one of these scenarios transpiring? 
For that matter, what are Mr. Ryan's odds of someday becoming president -- whether he's the 45th, 46th, 47th, or some later number in the sequence of people to hold the office?
Even more broadly, what does the future hold for running mates on winning tickets? And what about those on losing ones?
There are too many variables to compute these chances exactly, but we can make some reasonable guesses based on the historical record. 
First, let's consider the case that Mr. Romney would be most pleased with: that he and Mr. Ryan are the winning ticket in November, and Republicans re-capture the White House.
Twenty-eight men have been elected vice president since 1900, double-counting those (like George Herbert Walker Bush in 1980 and 1984) who were elected twice. Let's give Mr. Biden a mulligan, since he hasn't yet had a chance to seek an open nomination. That leaves us with 27 cases.
In the chart that follows, I've sorted the 27 winning vice presidents by the margin by which their ticket won the popular vote. Then I documented whether they sought the presidency in some subsequent election, whether they won a party nomination, and whether they were actually elected to the Oval Office.
The clear majority of winning vice presidential nominees -- 21 of 27, again counting cases like Mr. Bush twice -- ran for president themselves at some point. One qualification: the definition of what counts as "running" for president is a little fuzzy, especially in the era before presidential primaries were common. But I've applied a relatively liberal standard. For instance, the winning vice president under Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940, Henry A. Wallace, gets credit for both running for and winning a party nomination in 1948 -- although it was with the Progressive Party, and not the Democrats.
The elected vice presidents who failed to eventually seek the presidency had pretty good reasons for it. James S. Sherman, elected vice president to William Howard Taft in 1908, died during the course of the 1912 election when he and Mr. Taft were seeking another term. Spiro T. Agnew, the winning vice president in 1968 and 1972, resigned from office before his second term was completed. Charles Curtis, who was Herbert Hoover's vice president in 1928, saw his ticket lose disastrously in the landslide of 1932. And Dick Cheney was exceptionally unpopular by the time that Republicans were planning for the 2008 election cycle.
Of the winning vice presidents who did run for the presidency, 13 eventually won their party's nomination. This includes cases, like Lyndon Baines Johnson, of men who had ascended to the presidency before doing so, and ran for re-election as incumbents. 
Even if you exclude those instances, however, you wind up with a batting average of close to 50 percent when former vice presidents sought their party nomination. That's pretty impressive, considering that there might typically be a half-dozen viable candidates seeking an open nomination. Sitting vice presidents are, literally and figuratively, the "next in line" in their parties, and they can sometimes clear their fields of competition.
Finally, there were eight cases (counting Richard Nixon and the elder Mr. Bush twice each) in which the winning vice-presidential nominee was later a winning presidential candidate -- or about 30 percent of the total.
Incidentally, there have been no cases since 1900 in which someone was elected vice president, and then ascended to the presidency after a death or resignation, without later being elected to another presidential term themselves. What about Gerald Ford? He succeeded Mr. Nixon in 1974, but then lost his bid for re-election in 1976. But Mr. Ford had also never been elected vice president; instead, he succeeded Mr. Agnew. So he's excused on a technicality.
Put these bits of trivia aside. A very obvious (and intuitive) fact emerges from this data. Mr. Ryan is much more likely to eventually become president if he and Mr. Romney win this year's election.
In fact, the track record of losing vice-presidential candidates is quite underwhelming. There are 28 of these cases since 1900. (We will count Sarah Palin even though we didn't count Mr. Biden, since she had an open nomination this year but declined to seek it.)
Of these 28 men and women who lost their vice-presidential bids, only nine later ran for president. Only three of them later won their party's nomination, and just one -- Franklin D. Roosevelt -- later won the presidency.
The losing candidates who later ran for president generally had one of two things in common. First, if their loss was very close, it did not seem to harm their reputations nearly as much. Of the eight vice presidential candidates whose tickets lost the election by 5 or fewer percentage points, seven actually did run for president at some later point. (The exception was Charles W. Fairbanks, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1916, but did not seek the office again after his vice presidential bid also failed that November.)
The other circumstance is when a vice president on a losing ticket had previously been on a winning one. Walter Mondale and Dan Quayle, who later sought the presidency (although Mr. Quayle's bid in 2000 was a flop), had won the vice presidency in 1976 and 1988, respectively, before losing it four years later.
The exceptional case is Mr. Roosevelt. He and the Democratic nominee for president, James M. Cox of Ohio, were decimated in the 1920 election, losing to Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge by more than 26 percentage points. 
But Mr. Roosevelt later came back to be elected president four times. So nothing can be ruled out.
Still, if Mr. Ryan fails to win the vice presidency this year, his political future should be aided substantially if he and Mr. Romney at least keep the margin respectable. If the Republicans lose the election by about 3 points -- around what their deficit to Mr. Obama appears to be now -- then Mr. Ryan will be able to claim that he at least did not do the ticket any harm.
A narrow defeat for Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan, also, would still leave Republicans with decent-to-good chances to retain the House of Representatives. And it's not impossible that they could take over the Senate, since there are quite a lot of seats in play, and since a good half-dozen of them are idiosyncratic cases that may come down more to local factors than the overall partisan tide. 
If Republicans do reasonably well in these Congressional races but fail to win the presidency, some in the party may even claim -- and it's a logical enough case -- that the problem was with the top of the ticket and not with Mr. Ryan.
A decisive loss, however -- if Mr. Obama wins re-election by 5 percentage points more, potentially coming close to his margin of victory in 2008 -- could substantially tarnish Mr. Ryan's reputation. At that point, Mr. Romney will have gotten a worse result than his standing in the polls before he selected Mr. Ryan.
Furthermore, such a loss would be suggestive that there was something fundamentally wrong with the Republican candidates. Somewhat contrary to the conventional wisdom, most of the forecasting models put together by economists and political scientists predict either an essentially tied election, or a narrow win for Mr. Obama. (Why? Incumbents have historically gotten a lot of credit from voters. And voters have historically had short economic memories. If a case can be made that the economy is improving, the incumbent's odds are decent, even if it is clearly not firing on all cylinders.)
But few of these models call for a decisive win for Mr. Obama. If he wins by 7 points or so with this economy, and with only break-even approval ratings, that will be more than getting the benefit of the doubt from voters. Instead, it would suggest that many voters felt they had no other choice, given an uncharacteristically poor Republican alternative. 
With a margin in the mid-to-high single digits, also, Democrats would be clear favorites to retain the Senate, and the House of Representatives would be in play. Mr. Ryan would undoubtedly retain pockets of support within his party, but unless there were some other excuse for the loss (an unexpectedly good series of jobs reports, or an unexpected scandal involving Mr. Romney), he would be remembered as being part of a hugely disappointing election.
We can systematize this knowledge by performing a regression analysis on the historical data. For our technically-inclined readers: what I'll be using here is a type of regression called ordered logit, which is appropriate when there is a hierarchy of categorical outcomes (running for president; winning the nomination; becoming president). The independent variables are the ticket's margin of victory or defeat in the popular vote, a variable indicating whether they won the Electoral College and ascended to the White House, an interaction term between the two, and a time trend. 
The interaction term serves to capture the asymmetry in the data. If you are elected vice president, it doesn't seem to matter much what your ticket's margin of victory was. Once you're in office, you're in, and it's hard to predict what will transpire from there other than that your chances of someday becoming president have gone way up. 
But if you lost the election as the vice-presidential candidate, keeping it close seems to make quite a bit of difference to your fortunes. That way, you can make a more credible claim that the problems with the campaign were isolated to a few issues or bouts of misfortune -- none of them implicating your role in it, of course -- rather than the whole thing having been a debacle and everyone associated with it being inherently suspect.
The inclusion of the time trend is more debatable. Over the past century or so, there has been a very modest tendency toward vice presidents remaining more active in presidential politics after they ran for the office. The variable isn't statistically significant, but it coincides with a general increase in stature for the vice-presidential slot, so I think there is a theoretical basis for including it. But it only has an impact around the margin, raising Mr. Ryan's odds just slightly.
The figure below reflects the actuarial odds of Mr. Ryan running for president, winning his nomination, and winning the election in some future November, conditional upon different margins of victory or defeat for him and Mr. Romney this year. You will notice that there is a kink in the graph. This is when Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney go from losing this year's election to winning it, and Mr. Ryan's odds of becoming president some day increase sharply.
If Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney lose the election by a single point, the equation estimates that Mr. Ryan still has better-than-even odds -- 63 percent -- of someday running for president. His chances of winning the nomination are 28 percent under this analysis, and he has a 14 percent chance of winning a general election as the presidential candidate.
But what if they lose in a 7-point blowout, and Mr. Obama matches his winning margin from 2008? Then Mr. Ryan's chances of running for president are down to 44 percent. And his probability of actually becoming president are cut in half, to 7 percent.
The best case, of course, is if Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney win. Suppose, for instance, that they do win, but by a single point (and also win the Electoral College). 
Then, Mr. Ryan's chances of running for president are calculated at 84 percent. His probability of winning a future party nomination is 53 percent, and of becoming president, 33 percent -- about one in three. 
When I average these results across the entire range of scenarios that our forecast model articulates -- substantial losses for Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan, narrow losses, and wins by various plausible margins -- I come up with about a 15 percent chance of Mr. Ryan someday becoming president.
His odds of becoming the 45th president are slimmer, however. For that to happen, he first needs Mr. Obama to win re-election. Unfortunately for Mr. Ryan, that's the "easy" part. Our forecast now gives Mr. Obama about a 72 percent chance of winning another term.
Next, he needs Mr. Obama to finish out his entire second term. If Mr. Obama resigns sometime in mid-2014 after a major scandal, Republican odds of re-claiming the White House will look very good in 2016 -- but someone (probably Mr. Biden) will have become the 45th president first, before Mr. Ryan or another Republican could become the 46th. Without considering any factors specific to Mr. Obama, historically 83 percent of presidents have completed their four-year term.
Then Mr. Ryan needs to win the general election in 2016. Conditional upon he and Mr. Romney having lost this year's election, the model does not evaluate his chances of this as being all that good. Specifically, the model gives Mr. Ryan a 9 percent chance of eventually becoming president conditional upon losing this year's election. Moreover, some of those cases involve instances where Mr. Ryan would become president in 2020 (or 2024 or 2028, and so on) after someone else -- Hillary Rodham Clinton or Marco Rubio, for instance -- succeeds Mr. Obama as the 45th president. If you correct for that, it lowers Mr. Ryan's odds to about 7 percent of becoming president after the 2016 election specifically, after having lost this one.
Finally, we consider the entire parlay of events: that Mr. Obama wins in 2012, that he serves out all four years, and that Mr. Ryan runs and wins in 2016. The chances of this are only about 4 percent.
We can also account for the alternate means by which Mr. Ryan could become the 45th president: if, for some reason, Mr. Romney is unable to complete his bid this year -- and then Mr. Ryan replaces him, and wins the election. Historically, of the roughly 100 major-party tickets in the history of the nation, only one presidential nominee (Horace Greeley in 1872) died, or resigned the nomination, between the party conventions and Inauguration Day. Accounting for this oddball case, Mr. Ryan's probability of becoming the 45th president increases only to about 4.5 percent.
So Mr. Romney's misstatement will probably not turn out to be ironically prescient: the odds that Paul Ryan literally becomes the next president of the United States are about 20-to-1 against. But his odds of someday becoming president are much higher than that, and they'll increase to about 1-in-3 if he and Mr. Romney win this November.
Of course, this is a one-size-fits all calculation, which doesn't consider anything about Mr. Ryan specifically. The fact that he is quite young, that the Republican Party lacks an obvious successor other than him, and that he commands the respect of both the party base and the party establishment, all work in his favor in terms of running for and winning future nominations. Whatever happens this year, he is likely to be a major part of the American political landscape for a long time to come.

HEADLINE: Julius Baer Buys a Bank of America Unit

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON - The Swiss bank Julius Baer agreed on Monday to buy the private banking operations outside the United States of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a deal that will increase the European firm's assets under management by 40 percent.The acquisition is the latest consolidation move in the private banking industry, as firms look to bolster their operations to gain access to the new markets of emerging economies. 
As part of this effort, Julius Baer will pay about $882 million for the American bank's international wealth management business outside of the United States. The sale does not include Bank of America's joint venture in Japan, Mitsubishi UFJ Merrill Lynch PB Securities
In total, the division has about $84 billion of assets under management.
As part of the deal, Bank of America will be given about $246 million of Julius Baer stock, giving the American bank a 3 percent stake in the Swiss firm.
Even so, Bank of America has been shedding overseas holdings, in large part to raise capital. In November, it recorded a gain of $1.8 billion after taxes on the sale of its stake in China Construction Bank. And it sold its credit card business in Canada.
For Julius Baer, the acquisition will increase the bank's assets under management to about $258 billion. Under the terms of the deal, the Swiss firm will oversee up to an additional $74 billion of assets, which primarily come from wealthy clients in developing economies.
"This acquisition brings us a major step forward in our growth strategy and will considerably strengthen Julius Baer's leading position in global private banking by adding a new dimension not only to growth markets but also to Europe," the company's chief executive, Boris Collardi, said in a statement.
Despite the bank's large increase in assets under management, investors reacted negatively to the news. Shares in Julius Baer fell 7.4 percent by the close of trading in Zurich on Monday.
The shareholder response came after the Swiss bank said it would finance the acquisition through existing cash reserves and a $770 million rights offering. The bank said it would raise an additional $257 million for potential future acquisitions and $206 million through hybrid bonds.
The firm also canceled a previously announced $510 million share buyback.
Julius Baer said costs related to the acquisition would total about $320 million, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch would assume about $125 million of costs connected to the deal.
The deal is one of a number of acquisitions by Julius Baer in recent years. In 2009, it bought the private banking unit of the Dutch firm ING for approximately $500 million.
The deal is expected to close by early 2013. Perella Weinberg advised Julius Baer on the acquisition.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Britain Basks in a Golden Afterglow

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- So what do they do for an encore?Over the past two weeks, Olympic Britain has become used to a daily diet of awe at its own success; of cheering on the excellent to feats of greater prowess; of rediscovering a sense of possibility that had been muted.
All too often in the past, Britons have deluded themselves about their prospects of sporting success, only to see their heroes tumble in the face of a real challenge. 
But, contrary to all the curmudgeonly grumbling that preceded them, the Olympic Games have replaced such ambiguity with a tally of 29 gold medals, exceeded only by the United States and China, as if the nation had been blessed by what Samuel Smiles, the Victorian advocate of individual will and self-betterment, called ''the gift of miracles.''
The simple answer to the question of an encore is that Britain's attention will turn to the Paralympics later this month. But the legacy of the London Games may lie in something more imponderable, a finer sense of a nation relaunched, albeit in a time of economic doldrums that could yet becalm its renewal.
Most lands tend to see the Olympics through their own jingoistic prism, and Britain has been no exception, focusing obsessively on its triumphs -- though not to the exclusion of the great sporting moments provided by non-Britons like Usain Bolt of Jamaica, among others. But consider just a few omens.
The Games took place almost exactly a year after riots and looting spread from London to other British cities, shocking the country with a vision of a society whose greed had produced an underclass fueled by violence, envy and alienation.
''Of course, the comedown will happen,'' Suzanne Moore wrote in her column in The Guardian. ''But we have seen ourselves for a while in our best light: glittery and happy, belonging to something bigger than all of us.''
''Here we are, all in it together, just for a while,'' she added.
What were the markers along the way? First off, perhaps, was the opening ceremony, a celebration of a land at ease with its past and its present. But then, with the men's 10,000- and 5,000-meter runs, when Mo Farah, who had arrived in Britain from Somalia as a child, took gold twice and enfolded himself in the union flag, something else seemed to crystallize about these Games.
True, some of the contests -- dressage on fancy horses, for instance -- have long been the domain of a privileged few. But here were voices from a different Britain.
The cavalcade of winners included the queen's granddaughter Zara Phillips (silver, equestrian), but it also ranged over a spectrum of skin tones and a medley of speech patterns -- the accents that signal origin and, to a large extent, education and class.
And who was doing the talking? The ''golden girls,'' as one headline writer put it, included Nicola Adams, a black 29-year-old flyweight from northern England who became the first British woman to win Olympic gold in boxing, restriking the gender balance, at least on the victor's podium.
The banner under which the athletes jousted for glory also bespoke a greater sense of inclusion. Britain often competes internationally with separate teams from its component parts. But the Olympics offered a chance for Great Britain -- Team GB -- to draw on broader reserves of talent.
''So the Union Jack has been rescued from the old connotations of vanished empire and has become a vibrant, colorful symbol of contemporary British identity,'' The Independent said in an editorial, suggesting that the surge of Britishness, engulfing athletes like Andy Murray (Scottish, men's singles tennis, gold), may at least temporarily drown the clamor for Scottish separatism.
Of course, this could all get too gushy, coming only weeks after Queen Elizabeth II's diamond jubilee coaxed forth an equal stirring of the national soul. The British still have a talent for taking success for granted until complacency proves their undoing.
For all the Olympic excitement, this is a country facing deep economic woes. From anecdotal evidence, the $14 billion Games may have set the economy back further, frightening would-be visitors and Britons alike away from central London, even as others thronged the Olympic Park.
After the closing ceremony Sunday night, it seemed even more difficult to imagine how Britain might produce an encore. Perhaps the answer lay in a recalibration of the national myth, evoked in what could be the fondly self-mocking anthem of this rediscovered Britain -- Monty Python's Eric Idle leading the Olympic Stadium in singing his classic song ''Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.''
''Sporting failure has fitted comfortably into the story of a nation in decline, a country that has lost an empire and failed to find the goal net,'' the often dystopian broadcaster Jeremy Paxman wrote in The Sunday Telegraph. But the ''biggest revelation'' about the Games ''is the obvious one,'' he said. ''A nation that had elevated failure into a conviction is actually rather good'' at its opposite.

HEADLINE: Convention Time, Clog Time

BYLINE: By AMY ZIPKIN

 BODY:
Summer, with its often-violent storms, does not always mix well with business travel. But the wildfires in the West and high-security events like the London Olympics and two political conventions are making this summer particularly challenging.For those headed west, for example, the wildfires that forced hotel evacuations and closings in Colorado in June were the start of a record-setting fire season that is expected to continue into October and November. Last Thursday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration raised its prediction of hurricanes this season.
''We are increasing the likelihood of an above-normal season because storm-conducive wind patterns and warmer-than-normal sea surface temperatures are now in place in the Atlantic,'' said Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster at the Climate Prediction Center. 
Then, of course, there are the man-made high-security events, beginning with the Summer Games, which ended on Sunday in London, and continuing with the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., from Aug. 27 to 30, with an expected 50,000 visitors, and the Democratic National Convention for three days in Charlotte, N.C., starting on Labor Day, which is expected to attract 35,000 people.
Along with anticipated protests, the conventions may lead to road closings and general disruptions. What this all means to business travelers and employers, said Wendy Lane, a labor and employment attorney with Greenberg Glusker in Los Angeles who drafts travel policies for corporate clients, is ''an extra level of delay as airlines maximize efficiency by canceling flights and consolidating flights.''
To deal with the unexpected, business travelers may need self-reliance and flexibility. ''The most important thing to pack is patience,'' said Henry Harteveldt, chief research officer and co-founder of the Atmosphere Research Group in San Francisco. He recommended that travelers explore alternative transportation options like trains and ferries. And he suggested carefully monitoring potential problems at their destination.
Exploring transportation alternatives made sense to Roy Berger, president and chief executive of MedjetAssist, a medical transport membership company in Birmingham, Ala. Mr. Berger said he was caught in a hailstorm at La Guardia Airport in New York in mid-July. Buttonholing the pilot of his flight to Birmingham, he learned that the gate attendant was about to announce the cancellation of the flight. Mr. Berger hailed a cab to Penn Station, where he caught a train south to Baltimore. There, he was able to connect with another southbound plane with minutes to spare after persuading fellow passengers to let him cut in front of them at the security screening.
Weather, and other hazards, can now be better anticipated. Starting in late June, a system that sends emergency alerts via texts began operating on compatible cellphones. The system is the result of a partnership among the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Communications Commission and the wireless industry.
''This new public safety system allows customers who own an enabled mobile device in an area where their service provider has deployed the capability to receive geographically targeted textlike messages alerting them of imminent threats to safety in their areas,'' said Damon Penn, FEMA program director. Events like tornadoes, hurricanes, an active shooter or an industrial accident will be the subject of notifications. Almost all wireless carriers have signed on, but consumers need to check if the service is available in their area.
As to the impact of the Olympics, Mark Naysmith, the Games readiness director at Deloitte UK, based in London, began in 2009 to consult with London-area clients about dealing with heightened security and transportation delays and traffic restrictions, all while anticipating a possible increase in business during the Olympics.
Some things did not quite work out as planned. While many consumer businesses, particularly in hospitality, leisure and retailing, experienced rises in demand, according to a survey the firm took during the first week of the Games, that bounce was less than they had expected earlier in the year.
The end of the summer will bring the quadrennial nominating conventions. ''Fair to say visitors are not going to be able to travel as freely as in a normal week in Charlotte and Tampa,'' said Daniel J. Kaniewski, deputy director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at George Washington University.
Mr. Kaniewski said that in his experience, travelers should expect a range of issues, including, ''fences, screening including metal detectors and rerouting transportation.''
The possibility of such measures has given some Tampa businesses pause. Rhea F. Law, the chief executive and chairwoman at the law firm Fowler, White, Boggs, said she expected her office to start earlier, at 7:30 a.m., and close early while the convention was in town. Partners are being advised to work from home. The support staff will be paid their regular salary for shorter days.
Others are taking a more active approach. Douglas Brewer, an executive vice president at In-Rel, a property management firm that has its headquarters in Lake Worth, Fla., and offices in Tampa, said his firm sent an e-mail advising tenants at the city's Rivergate complex to stay away and work from home if possible. ''I can see a half-hour commute turning into a two-hour commute,'' he said. He anticipates having to juggle to arrange building deliveries and garbage removal, and expects cleaning to be suspended until the building returns to a normal schedule.
In Charlotte, Michael Smith, the president and chief executive of the Charlotte Center City Partners, a nonprofit group that cultivates economic development in the central business district, where the convention will be held, is optimistic. He said he was encouraging the area's 83,000 employees to come to work despite tight security and expected transportation disruptions. The light rail line that serves the area will skip at least two stops and pedestrian access to streets and businesses near the Bank of America Stadium will be limited.
And Mr. Smith acknowledged that it would be difficult to find hotel rooms for anyone other than conventioneers. ''There will be no room at the inn,'' he said. Sid Smith, executive director of the Charlotte Area Hotel Association, said business travelers might need to find lodging in Raleigh, a two-and-a-half-hour drive away.

HEADLINE: Peregrine Chief Is Indicted In Brokerage Fraud Case

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
A month after confessing to stealing from clients and defrauding banks, Russell R. Wasendorf Sr., the chief executive of the collapsed brokerage firm Peregrine Financial Group, was indicted on Monday by a federal grand jury.The move is the latest development in what prosecutors say was a long-ranging fraud for a prominent figure in the futures industry, which largely consists of money management firms that trade contracts in commodities, currencies and interest rates. 
The grand jury, convened in Federal District Court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, indicted Mr. Wasendorf on charges of making false statements to regulators.
"On 31 occasions between about February 2010 and June 2012, Wasendorf caused false reports to be submitted to the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission," Stephanie M. Rose, the United States attorney in Cedar Rapids, said in a statement.
Mr. Wasendorf faces a maximum prison term of 155 years and fines of about $7.75 million, prosecutors said. An arraignment date has not been set.
His lawyer, Jane Kelly, a federal public defender in Iowa, did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
Last month, local police in Cedar Falls, Iowa, where Peregrine was based, found Mr. Wasendorf unconscious in his car in the company parking lot after a suicide attempt. He had left a note admitting to embezzling more than $100 million from his clients by falsifying bank statements and lying to regulators. Regulators found a customer fund shortfall of at least $200 million.
Since his arrest on July 13, Mr. Wasendorf, 64, has been held in a county jail. No other Peregrine executives has been charged in the case. Mr. Wasendorf's son, Russell R. Wasendorf Jr., the company's No. 2 executive, has been subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Inside the Rings: Guts, Greatness and Gaffes on Full Display in London

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
LONDON -- Danny Boyle and the British started this Olympics off in unconventional fashion : a ''Chariots of Fire'' spoof; an ode to the National Health Service; geese and sheep on the same infield where Olympians would eventually throw javelins and discuses.But the British followed a more traditional path after the Opening Ceremony: fine sport in rollicking venues with the emphasis on who got the medals. Traditional honors -- knighthoods, damehoods, etc. -- are sure to follow.
Time to hand out our own Olympic prizes before the royals beat us to it:
Best performance on land Sure, Usain Bolt finished off an unprecedented triple-triple, winning the 100 meters, the 200 meters and the 4x100 relay with Jamaica for the second consecutive Olympics. Sure, David Rudisha set his own pace and boldly became the first man to break 1 minute 41 seconds in the 800. 
But did Bolt or Rudisha do any of this on a broken leg? Step up, Manteo Mitchell , the little-known American runner who felt something pop as he ran the opening leg of the heats in the 4x400-meter relay. In great pain, Mitchell kept on running, allowing the United States to qualify for the final, where it won a silver medal. ''I'm pretty amazed that I still split 45 seconds on a broken leg,'' Mitchell said.
Worst performance on land Some Brazilians, still cursing their Olympic luck, might lobby for their men's soccer team, which once again failed to win the gold medal despite the creative contributions of Neymar and a spot in the final against Mexico. But that would be forgetting what happened to the world's leading nation in men's soccer, long before the medal round. Spain -- champion of Europe and the world -- failed to score a single goal in three games. Coach Luis Milla is now looking for work in a bad Spanish economy.
Best performance in water Michael Phelps's 17-year-old American teammate Missy Franklin had clearly been studying Phelps's time-management skills, and on July 30 she dived in for the semifinals of the 200-meter freestyle and managed to qualify for the final. Less than 15 minutes later, she returned to the pool to win the 100-meter backstroke and her first Olympic gold medal.
Worst performance in water After winning a surprise gold medal on the first night of competition in the women's 4x100-meter freestyle, the swimming superpower Australia could not win another as its new star, James ''The Missile'' Magnussen, repeatedly failed to launch. Australian swimming has instead launched an independent performance review of the national program. But the Australians were still world beaters compared with the Germans, who won no medals in the pool for the first time since 1932.
Best performance on water Shifting winds have not shifted Ben Ainslie's Olympic fortunes. He became the only person to win medals in sailing in five consecutive Olympics. He has won gold in the last four Games and won it in the Finn class in Weymouth, England, despite a serious challenge from Jonas Hoegh-Christensen of Denmark. Just don't tell him he is the greatest British sailor since Admiral Lord Nelson. ''I didn't rescue the nation from the depths of Napoleon Bonaparte,'' Ainslie said. ''You do the best you can in your style of racing.''
Worst performance on water Hamadou Djibo Issaka, a 35-year-old gardener and swimming pool attendant from the landlocked African nation of Niger, started rowing only three months ago and trained for London in an old fishing boat.
It showed as he finished last (by a lot) in qualifying heats in his single scull, but don't take lack of speed for lack of popularity.
Though the retired British rowing great Steve Redgrave was resistant to Issaka's taking part, the crowd at Eton Dorney embraced him. ''Belt up, Sir Steve!'' wrote The Guardian in an editorial. ''Now Niger knows about rowing, the spectators at Eton Dorney have had something to cheer before a medal's been won, and Mr. Issaka has proved a great sport, if not necessarily a great sportsman. Isn't that what it's about?''
Best performance in midair It required something extraordinary to take this prize in an Olympics when Queen Elizabeth jumped out of a helicopter (or so Boyle would have had us believe). But that was the real Epke Zonderland on the horizontal bar: releasing, twisting, playing tricks with gravity. His body was a Zonderland, and what mean-spirited gymnastics judge could have denied the flying Dutchman what he deserved? Gold.
Worst performance in midair In a normal year, Boris Johnson , the mayor of London, would have locked this up when he got stuck on a zip line during the Games. But this was no normal year. There is a school of thought that, in an overstuffed Olympics involving more than 10,000 athletes, it is better to lose interestingly than to win routinely. Those who consider YouTube hits to be the new coin of the realm can only agree in the case of Stephan Feck. The German diver bounced on the end of the 3-meter springboard, put a foot wrong and ended up losing control and doing a back flop.
The dive of the 2012 Olympics earned zero points and millions of viewers.
Best performance under crushing pressure Forget -- just for a moment -- Jessica Ennis, Mo Farah and Bolt.
Sebastian Coe and the London Organizing Committee had to put on the modern world's grandest spectacle in the midst of a British economic downturn with security costs soaring and a sudden shortage of security guards altogether with the event approaching. Government inquiries were started. Hands (but happily no necks) were wrung. Yet all went swimmingly as the Games were a resounding success. Final bill, please.
Worst performance under crushing pressure Matthias Steiner, the German weight lifter, failed to lift 196 kilograms, or 433 pounds, in the snatch, lost control of the bar and crumpled to the floor as the weight landed on his neck and Olympic officials hustled to put up a curtain to shield spectators from the view. Now for the happy ending in an Olympics that was full of them: Steiner suffered no major injuries.
Best performance when unable to compete Liu Xiang's Achilles tendon gave out as he crashed into the first hurdle, but Liu still found the energy to hop on his good leg the rest of the distance down the track and then plant a what-should-have-been kiss on the 10th and final hurdle.
Worst performance when able to compete Serves intentionally in the net. Errors galore. Boos and whistles from spectators who were upset at the absence of spectacle after they had actually managed to get tickets through the London Organizing Committee's Web site.
Badminton and round-robin made for bad bedfellows in London, and four doubles teams were disqualified for lack of effort. Now it is time to disqualify round-robin from Rio in 2016.
Best performance, medal in hand The players on the victorious French handball team, seldom short of their own ideas, decided to steal a page from an Olympian who gets plenty of practice celebrating. They all did Bolt's signature, arm-extended move, which is not, by the way, a lightning bolt.
Worst performance, medal in hand Felipe Kitadai, a Brazilian judoka, was so attached to his new bronze medal that he even took it into the shower. He dropped it, breaking it and denting it. The International Olympic Committee finally agreed to supply him with a replacement.
Best performance, pen in hand with Olympics as muse Before he got stuck on the zip line, Mayor Johnson wrote a column in The Daily Telegraph headlined, ''20 Jolly Good Reasons to Feel Good About the Games.''
Reason No.6. ''We certainly didn't spend the Beijing-style sums on fireworks -- since the Chinese blew roughly the same amount as the British defense budget -- but we unquestionably had the same global éclat.''
Reason No.16: ''The Olympics are proving to be a boost to tattoo parlors. Plenty of people seem to want their thighs inscribed with ''Oylimpics 2012'' and other ineradicable misspellings.''
Reason No.19. ''As I write these words there are semi-naked women playing beach volleyball in the middle of the Horse Guards Parade immortalized by Canaletto. They are glistening like wet otters and the water is splashing off the brims of the spectators' sou'westers. The whole thing is magnificent and bonkers.''
Worst performance, pen in hand with Olympics as muse The Westfield mall in Stratford, the über-commercial gateway to the Olympic Park, had to apologize after making welcome banners in Arabic that were unfortunately unintelligible to Arabic speakers. Reuters reported that the Council for Advancing Arab-British Relations said the banners were the equivalent of signs supposed to read ''WELCOME TO LONDON'' being printed: ''N O D N O L O T E M O C L E W.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Slower Growth in Asia Drags Down Markets

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks fell Monday as evidence piled up that the global economic slowdown was hurting Asia.The losses broke a six-day winning streak for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the longest since December 2010.
Japan's economy grew in the second quarter at a 1.4 percent annual rate, slower than many analysts had expected. Last week, China released dismal figures on retail sales and exports in July. Traders were disappointed that Beijing failed to introduce stimulus measures over the weekend. 
Slower growth in Asia worries investors because its economic endurance has helped offset weakness in the United States and Europe in recent years. Exports from China and Japan are declining as Europe's economic woes hurt consumer confidence there.
''What's happened is the law of gravity is starting to hit,'' said Douglas Coté, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. Japan is volatile because it is still recovering from last year's powerful earthquake and tsunami, he said, and China's growth is slowing sharply.
Yet stocks, bonds and most other investments are all up for the year, Mr. Coté noted. He said the markets have been ''pricing in Armageddon when clearly things are much better than that.''
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 38.52 points, or 0.29 percent, at 13,169.43. The S.& P. 500 declined 1.76 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,404.11. The Dow is still up 7.8 percent for the year, the S.& P. 11.7 percent.
The S.& P. 500 and the Dow have risen every week for the last five weeks. The S.& P. 500 last had a five-week climb in mid-March. The Dow hasn't done so since last October.
Mondays, however, have brought mostly losses for the market in recent weeks. The Dow has fallen for 10 of the last 11 Mondays, and the S.& P. 500 has finished down five of the last six.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.66 points, or 0.05 percent, to 3,022.52. The index was helped by solid gains for two of its biggest components, Apple and Google.
Google rose 2.8 percent after announcing that it would cut 20 percent of the staff at Motorola Mobility, the struggling mobile phone maker it acquired in May. Motorola hasn't had a hit product since it introduced the Razr in 2005. Google's stock rose $18.01 to $660.01. Apple rose $8.30 to $630.
Groupon plunged in aftermarket electronic trading after the daily deals Web site said its revenue fell short of analysts' forecasts. Groupon was down $1.41, or 18.7 percent, at $6.14.
Most Asian and European markets closed lower. Stocks edged higher in Spain. Many traders said they believe that the European Central Bank will take a more active role in fighting the region's debt crisis by reducing borrowing costs for Spain, Italy and others.
Monetary authorities in the United States and China also are believed to be weighing plans to stimulate growth. Central banks have been hesitant so far to get involved with an economy that may be on the cusp of a rebound. They are mindful, however, of the effect of an achingly slow recovery on businesses and consumers.
China revealed on Friday that export growth in July fell to just 1 percent from 11.3 percent as recently as the previous month. That was well below forecasts for about 5 percent.
Investors had divergent reactions to two major asset sales by the energy giant BP. Tesoro rose 9.5 percent, the most in the S.& P. 500 index, after saying it would pay $2.5 billion for a California refinery, pipelines, storage terminals and the Arco-branded retail outlets in the Southwest. Tesoro's stock rose $3.37 to $38.87.
Eagle Rock Energy Partners fell 2.7 percent after the company agreed to buy two BP gas processing plants in Texas for $227.5 million. The stock fell 24 cents to $8.72.
Interest rates were steady.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 2/32, to 99 20/32, and the yield rose to 1.67 percent, up from 1.66 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Confusion Over How to Aid Iran Quake Victims

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran.

 BODY:
The deadly double earthquakes in Iran over the weekend, the first natural disaster there since the United States imposed onerous financial sanctions on that country because of its disputed nuclear program, have raised worries among Iranian-Americans about where to send donations -- and whether such aid is even legal.American officials said Monday that humanitarian aid for victims of the disaster, which left more than 300 people dead and thousands homeless in a Turkish-speaking region of northwest Iran, was exempt from sanctions. But the National Iranian American Council, a Washington-based advocacy group representing Americans of Iranian descent, said that given the severity and scope of the sanctions, ''there are serious concerns that humanitarian relief will be hindered.''
In a statement on its Web site, the council said, ''The Obama administration should take all steps necessary to ensure that relief efforts are not obstructed due to the dispute between the U.S. and Iranian governments.'' 
Trita Parsi, the president of the council, said in a telephone interview that the American ban on financial transactions, which applies to two dozen Iranian banks, including the central bank, had made American banks reluctant to deal with any monetary transfers to Iran, even if they were permitted. ''Most banks just cut it off entirely,'' he said. ''We have to remember the policy of clipping the Iranian economy -- it has become a stigma.''
Mr. Parsi said the only practical alternative for Iranian-Americans who wanted to help the quake victims was to send money via family remittances, which are permitted under the sanctions, with the hope that the aid would reach its intended recipients or aid organizations working inside Iran. ''A lot of people are very upset,'' he said.
The Iranian American Bar Association, a Washington-based lawyer group, also expressed concern. In a letter to Adam J. Szubin, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which oversees the sanctions, the association said it was worried ''that the current United States sanctions imposed on Iran will hinder efforts to provide immediate humanitarian relief.'' The association urged the assets control office to reassure financial institutions ''that they are permitted to process transactions on behalf of U.S. persons related to earthquake relief efforts in Iran.''
Americans have no simple way to send relief aid to Iranian victims. Major international relief organizations like the Red Cross, Mercy Corps and AmeriCares said Monday that they were not accepting donations, for now, because Iran had not asked for their help. ''At this point, the Iranian government is managing this all on their own through a local relief organization (the Iranian Red Crescent), so we're not responding,'' Salma Bahramy, a spokeswoman for Mercy Corps, said in an e-mail.
At the same time, the Iranian government has sent conflicting signals about whether it is accepting aid and which countries would be acceptable donors. Many countries, including Iran's neighbors as well as the United States, have expressed condolences and offered emergency relief supplies. ''We stand ready to offer assistance in this difficult time,'' the White House said Sunday on its Web site.
Pooya Hajian, a spokesman for Iran's Red Crescent Society, said Iran would not accept aid from any country, only from other Red Cross organizations. ''There are no exceptions in this,'' he answered specifically about the offer from the United States. ''We have thanked Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia for their offers for help, but our domestic capabilities are sufficient.''
But the official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi as saying at a news conference in the northwestern city of Tabriz on Monday that ''in these circumstances, we are ready to receive assistance from various countries for the earthquake-stricken people.''

HEADLINE: Copter Crash May Hinder Offensive In Somalia

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Josh Kron contributed reporting from Kampala, Uganda, and Reuben Kyama from Nairobi.

 BODY:
NAIROBI, Kenya -- The Ugandan military has shifted heavy weaponry, including assault aircraft, into Somalia over the past few weeks, vowing to strike a final and decisive blow against the Shabab Islamist militant group.But on Monday, Ugandan officials said that of four military helicopters that took off from Uganda for Somalia on Sunday, only one made it to a refueling stop in Kenya. Another plunged into the thickly forested slopes of Mount Kenya, about halfway between Uganda and Somalia, where the Kenyan authorities rescued seven Ugandan crew members. The two other copters might have also crashed somewhere in Kenya. On Monday evening, the authorities still did not know exactly what had happened. 
Uganda's military spokesman, Col. Felix Kulayigye, said, ''We have unconfirmed information about the other two, that they did indeed have a hard landing along the highway to Garissa,'' a town in northern Kenya.
The Ugandans have taken the lead of an African Union peacekeeping force that has steadily battered the Somali militants who are down to one major stronghold, Kismayo, a port town, which the African Union plans to attack soon. The botched flights seemed to bode ill for the planned offensive on Kismayo and were a reminder of the woes of Uganda's fledgling air force.
In 2005, John Garang, the charismatic southern Sudanese rebel leader, was killed when the Ugandan military helicopter he was riding in crashed into a mountain.
In the 1990s, Uganda wound up buying what turned out to be ''junk helicopters'' in a scandal that cost the government millions of dollars, according to a World Bank file. A military journal said that a number of Uganda's Mi-24 attack helicopters -- the type that crashed on Mount Kenya -- are ''nonoperational.''
And just last year, witnesses said a Russian fighter jet bought by the Ugandan air force crash landed at the Entebbe airport in Uganda, though the authorities played down the accident.
On Monday, when asked about this record and the missing helicopters, Colonel Kulayigye said, ''An accident is an accident.''
The first Ugandan troops landed in Somalia in 2007 to a barrage of mortar shells, and since then the Ugandans have taken hundreds of casualties, making this mission one of the bloodiest of recent peacekeeping history.
Still, the Ugandans, joined by Burundians, Djiboutians and smaller contingents from other African countries, have chipped away at the Shabab, a brutal Islamist insurgent group that is considered both a regional menace and an international threat, with possible cells in the United States and Europe.

HEADLINE: Reform in Romania?

 BODY:
To the Editor:Re ''Bringing Romania Back From the Brink'' (Op-Ed, Aug. 3): 
Mircea Geoana writes that Romania's political system is dysfunctional. As a former head of Romania's Social Democratic Party (a biographical detail not mentioned), he should know.
But the agenda Mr. Geoana lists -- checks and balances, judicial reform, political dialogue, curbs on vested economic interests -- is hardly new. The truth is that no Romanian politician has shown the courage and skill to champion realizable, concrete reform steps.
And whatever the grievances against President Traian Basescu, his ouster, driven by appeals to populist dissatisfaction, would have strengthened Romania's winner-control-all dysfunction, not weakened it.

HEADLINE: Iran Preparing to Lead Global Nonaligned Group

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- Iran sometimes seems like one of the loneliest countries in the world, isolated by sanctions and shunned by Western leaders.But in Tehran lampposts are being painted and hotels cleared out for thousands of delegates, including, the government says, more than 40 heads of state, as the Islamic republic prepares to host its biggest international conference in 14 years.
Taking over from Egypt, Iran's leaders are ambitiously readying themselves for their three-year term as head of the Nonaligned Movement, which will convene in Tehran in the last week of August. 
The Nonaligned Movement, founded during the height of the cold war, when the divisions were chiefly East-West, regards itself as independent from the major centers of power, which are not quite as neatly lined up as before.
During a weeklong conference, followed by a leadership summit meeting, Iran says it will unfold plans to revitalize the movement and seek support for its nuclear enrichment program and its resistance to what it calls dominance by the United States.
Representatives of all of the 118 member nations, among them China, India and Indonesia, will travel to Tehran for the conference, while invitations have been extended to observer states and international organizations, such as the Arab League, and Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin.
In preparation, beggars are being cleared off Tehran's streets and the government has announced a five-day holiday for the entire capital during the summit. Major highways and the local airport will be closed off to ensure the safety and mobility of the visitors.
Following the meeting, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as Iran's head of state, will become the Nonaligned Movement's representative in several international meetings, starting with the United Nations General Assembly in September in New York.
For Iran's leaders, the conference performs the important function of underscoring what they say is worldwide support for their policy positions, particularly in the nuclear arena, where Iran has been subjected to strong Western sanctions over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment.
''It will show that this unipolar world is filled with justice-seeking countries, like the members of the N.A.M.,'' said Ali Akbar Javanfekr, Mr. Ahmadinejad's media adviser, in an interview on Saturday.
Iranian politicians maintain that the United States and Israel are trying to create what they call ''Iranophobia,'' trying to isolate its representatives during international meetings in Western capitals and portraying Iran as a rogue state.
On Friday, Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, asked the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, not to travel to Tehran for the meeting, saying it would lend legitimacy to ''a regime that represents the greatest danger to world peace,'' an Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, reported.
The diplomatic bonanza of the conference will help counter that effort, an influential lawmaker, Gholam Reza Mesbahi Moghaddam, told the Khabar Web site, showing that ''the United States has failed in its goal of isolating the Islamic republic from the rest of the world.''
Breaking with his practice of meeting primarily with Islamic leaders, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is set to open the meeting. He is convinced that the world is on the eve of major changes, and says the West is economically and spiritually paralyzed while ''Iran is providing answers to the world's questions,'' he said Sunday.
Since the end of the cold war and the rise of non-Western powers, the Nonaligned Movement has been looking for relevance. Iranian politicians say they see many comparisons between their worldview and the principles of the movement, which stresses independence and noninterference in domestic affairs.
Yet, Mr. Khamenei's foreign policy adviser, Ali Akbar Velajati, recently criticized the organization, saying it ''needs to undergo reforms and changes in terms of its infrastructure and content.'' He called for a permanent secretariat and hinted that it could be located in Tehran.
Iran also expects member nations to support its nuclear program, stressing that independence from world powers is every country's right. As an organization, the nonaligned countries have often supported Iran's drive for a nuclear energy program, but some of its individual members, such as Saudi Arabia, are strongly opposed, saying it is a cover for developing nuclear weapons.
Iran had hoped the new Egyptian president, Mohamed Morsi, the group's departing president, would serve as the guest of honor, but he has so far declined invitations.
Since his election, Mr. Morsi has been embroiled in a power struggle with Egypt's generals, a fight that boiled over this weekend with the forced retirement of several top officers.
President Bashar al-Assad of Syria is another expected no-show. ''Obviously he is needed in Syria to manage the situation,'' said Mohammad Reza Forqani, an official close to Mr. Ahmadinejad.
Security in Tehran is being significantly stepped up. As a first step, authorities announced that all visa agreements with neighboring and European Union countries had been canceled.

HEADLINE: Home Team Comes Through

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS and SANDY MACASKILL

 BODY:
LONDON -- It started inauspiciously for the British team on the first day of Olympic competition, with a jarring defeat of one of the country's favorite athletes, Mark Cavendish, a stage-winning Tour de France sprint cyclist.Considered a safe bet to win the 156-mile road race, Cavendish finished 29th, setting off premature epitaphs for the Games from commentators who scented disaster for Britain in the sporting competition, to go with dreadful summer weather and the bungling of security preparations that forced the government to draft in thousands of extra troops to secure the sporting venues.
But by the time the Games ended Sunday, 16 mostly sunny days later, Britain was celebrating success across the Olympic board with its highest ever yield of medals, including 29 golds. The gold total was Britain's best since it won 56 in the 1908 Games, also held in London, though that is hardly a fair yardstick because only 26 nations competed in those century-ago Games, in sports that included tug of war and shooting using live deer as targets. The Canadian favorite in the 1908 marathon, Tom Longboat, is said to have dropped out of the event after overdosing on Champagne. 
In the 2012 Games, the British squad of 541 competitors, known as Team GB, won 65 medals across 14 sports. Only two other countries, the United States and China, won more gold medals, 46 for the United States and 38 for China. While winning only 24 golds, Russia won 82 medals, pushing Britain into fourth place in the overall medal count.
By the measure of medals won in proportion to its population of 62 million, Britain -- with 5 percent of China's population, 20 percent of the United States' and 43 percent of Russia's -- could claim to have outperformed the nations that finished ahead of it in the medals table. It easily outpaced, too, its own medals haul from the 2008 Beijing Games, when it won 19 golds and 47 medals over all.
More compelling than any medal count, though, were the performances turned in by individual athletes. There was Helen Glover, a gold medalist in the women's coxless pairs, who never sat in a rowing boat until after the Beijing Games, when she answered a newspaper ad posted by Sir Steve Redgrave, a five-time Olympic rowing gold medalist, asking for tall, strong volunteers for elite performance training.
There was Nicola Adams, a 5-foot-4 flyweight from an inner-city community in the northern city of Leeds, who became the first British female boxer to be awarded an Olympic medal, defeating a Chinese world champion to win gold, then delighting her fans with her modesty about her achievements in a sport that was barred in Britain until 1996.
''It gives me goose bumps,'' she said, clutching her medal.
There was, too, Mo Farah, son of a Somali immigrant, with a goat-herding family still working the Somali scrublands, who won the 5,000- and 10,000-meter races, then leaned in to the camera to tell millions watching on BBC television that the country to which he owed his success was Britain, and that the formula for winning was simple. ''It's just a matter of hard graft,'' he said.
Another story that won British headlines was that of Charlotte Dujardin, a 27-year-old equestrian rider from a modestly placed family who had to use a grandmother's bequest to buy her first competitive horse. She won two golds in the individual and team events at the Olympic dressage competition despite having competed at the top level in the sport for only 18 months, against rivals who have competed at the Olympics for 20 years and more.
Despite going into the final of the individual event ''with legs like jelly,'' she posted one of the highest Olympic scores ever recorded to win the event.
Then there was Andy Murray, the perennial nearly man of men's professional tennis, etched in recent memory by his tearful loss to Roger Federer last month as the first Briton in 74 years to reach the Wimbledon men's singles final. He turned the form book upside down with a straight-sets defeat of Federer for the Olympic gold, played on Wimbledon's Centre Court. Once again, too, members of the royal family were there to cheer him.
The Host Advantage
An important factor in the British success, British competitors, coaches and commentators have agreed, has been the home-team advantage that has meant a surge in medals for many of the countries that have hosted the Games, often followed by a steep falloff at subsequent Olympics.
A case in point is Australia, which soared in the medals count with a total of 58 at its home games in Sydney in 2000, then dropped to 49 in Athens in 2004, and 46 in Beijing in 2008, and 35 in the London Games, a performance that has set off a debate among Australians about what went wrong -- and anxiety in Britain, which has competed with its former colony for sports bragging rights for more than a century, to ensure that it does not suffer a similar reverse.
One British winner after another has cited the roar of the home crowd and the sea of waving Union Jacks. Exulting in British performances that have served, at least for the moment, to boost national confidence at a time of dismal economic news, the crowds have drowned out the urgings of the athletes' coaches, and left competitors saying an hour or more afterward that they still have a ringing in their ears.
But along with the home-field factor, British commentators have acknowledged that much of the British success has been owed to what many here have seen as a very un-British decision in recent years to subsidize its Olympic competitors, putting them on the payroll in return for winning medals at the Games.
Through a program run by a government-created agency called UK Sport, more than a billion dollars in officially regulated lottery money and taxpayer subsidies have been poured into selected sports since the mid-1990s, nearly half of it in the four years since the Olympics in Beijing.
The program is similar to others among the 200 nations and territories that competed at the London Games, but notably different from the approach in the United States, where Olympic competitors, with no government financial support available, rely on corporate and other private financing.
Controversially, the most favored of Britain's sports have not necessarily been those with the widest base of popular participation and support, but those judged to have the best prospect of medal success, including canoeing, cycling, gymnastics, equestrian, field hockey, rowing, triathlon and track and field, some of them viewed in the past as elitist sports, or at least minor ones.
The money involved -- since the Beijing Games, about $40 million each for cycling, rowing, sailing, swimming and track and field, nearly $25 million for field hockey and about $20 million for equestrian -- goes toward improving sporting facilities and paying a salary to top competitors, which saves them from having to seek other work.
With the subsidies comes a warning that failure to achieve medals at the Games will cause the subsidies to be cut, or eliminated. On its Web site, UK Sport states its intentions with the steeliness of a corporate profit-planner. '' 'No compromise' describes our attitude,'' it says under the heading, ''Investment Principles.'' Under another heading, ''World Class Pathway,'' it says ''investment-per-athlete'' will be geared to medal prospects.
The program has been condemned as Darwinian by its critics and, among die-hard traditionalists, as alien to Britain's sporting traditions, deeply rooted until recent decades in the concept of the noble amateur. It has been no accident that many subsidized athletes who have been groomed to be medal winners and failed to win medals or qualify for finals have used their post-event television interviews, often in tears, to apologize profusely to ''everybody in the country'' for letting them down.
Competing Fairly, Not Winning
Until well after World War II, the very idea of a British competitor earning money -- much less the $42,000 in annual payments the most favored Olympians receive under the UK Sport formula, more than Britain's average family income -- was considered deeply unsporting and even ''working class'' by the sniffy, classbound elite who then governed most aspects of British life.
Roger Bannister, the first man to run a sub-four-minute mile, in 1954, said in an interview before the London Games that he spent his track years scrutinizing trophies to be sure none were valued at more than 12 pounds, the limit then for an amateur. For decades after that, English schoolboys were routinely admonished to observe the tradition that competing fairly, not winning, was all that mattered.
In newspaper reports of the 1950s England cricket teams, only well-heeled amateurs (''P.B.H. May, Captain) were listed with their initials, the professionals (''Trueman,'' regarded by many as the country's best-ever bowler, a Yorkshireman from a mining community with the first name of Fred) by their surnames only. And it was not thought odd for a team coach to come onto the field at halftime in a school rugby match, with his team trailing, 52-0, and congratulate all concerned. ''Very nearly very good,'' he said, handing out orange slices as a reward.
Historians like to note, proudly, that many of the sports at the heart of the modern Olympics originated, in their modern form at least, in Britain. But the change that turned the country from a genteel also-ran in the Olympics into the steely competitor it has been in London dates to a humiliating performance in the Atlanta Games of 1996, when Britain placed 36th in the medal table, with only one gold.
Key roles in establishing the current financing system were played by Sebastian Coe, the double-gold-medal-winning middle-distance Olympics runner in the 1980s, who has headed the organizing committee for the London Games after an interlude as a Conservative politician, and by John Major, prime minister in the 1990s, with a passion for sport that has seen him bellowing his support for British competitors at numerous events at the London Games.
Both were keen on extending into sport the Thatcher revolution of the 1980s, when Major's predecessor as prime minister demanded, in her terms, that Britain shake off its second-class sloth. It was Major, in 1993, who established Britain's national lottery, decreeing that sports should be among the ''good causes'' endowed by its profits. About 60 percent of the money that goes to Olympic athletes is drawn from the lottery money that goes to UK Sport, which was founded in 1997.
Big Change From Barcelona
The change in attitudes that has resulted was described by Carl Hester, 45, who is considered the architect of Britain's success in the equestrian dressage event last week, when the country won its first medals in the event, including team and individual gold.
He described his first Olympics, in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992. ''We had team T-shirts with a phrase on the back of them that was something like: 'Winning's not everything. Taking part is.' Can you imagine having that on the track suits now? It was something about us British. We were almost embarrassed to stand on the podium.''
The message he gave his dressage teammates -- Dujardin and Laura Bechtolsheimer, granddaughter of a German billionaire -- before the competition in London was far different.
''I told them that if we got a silver or a bronze, we had still made history,'' he said. ''But a few days later, I had to tell them something else because Team GB golds were coming in from all directions and it was obvious that we needed to win a gold or we'd be swallowed up in nothingness.''
Peter Keen, who until May this year was the performance director at UK Sport, is credited by many in sport as the man who built on the foundations laid by Coe and Major to achieve the country's current success. Keen recalled his experience as a high-performance cycling coach before the Atlanta Games, when he converted his home bathroom into a steam room to mimic the summer conditions in Atlanta.
''People called it 'fighting the system,' but there wasn't a system,'' he said. ''There was no pathway to excellence.''
When Keen became the performance director at British Cycling in 1998, he suggested in a team meeting that Britain aim at becoming the world's No. 1 cycling nation, a goal that many in Britain believe the country has now achieved, with 16 gold medals in cycling in Beijing and in London. There were audible snickers in the room.
Those snickers, he said, ''were a representation of something very common in people, not just the U.K. People generally avoid taking big risks to win. They would rather settle for the average, to avoid failure.''

For several years, the Wall Street wizards who built a faster, more fragmented stock market justified their creation by pointing to the benefits it yielded for investors in the form of lower trading costs.But as the speed and complexity of the markets have continued to change at a rapid pace -- with trade times now measured in millionths of a second -- a growing number of studies and market participants suggest that those benefits to investors have stalled or even started to reverse.
Research from the broker Abel/Noser indicates that the total cost for an investor to get into and out of a single share of stock fell by more than half between 2000 and 2010, to 3.5 cents. Since then, though, the cost has leveled off and then ticked up in the most recent quarter to 3.8 cents, confirming a trend that has also been visible in recent data from Credit Suisse Trading Strategy and from Celent, a consulting firm specializing in financial markets. 
The advantages of the nation's increasingly high-speed stock market are under the microscope after a number of recent trading malfunctions underscored the risks and instability that have come with the rapid changes. This month, one of Wall Street's most important trading firms, Knight Capital, lost $440 million in 45 minutes after installing faulty software designed to keep up with an evolving market.
As the battle to introduce more sophisticated technology continues, raising the specter of more problems like Knight's, the diminishing returns flowing back to investors are making even longtime proponents of innovation question whether the competition to make the market faster and more efficient is now doing more harm than good.
''They've reached the point where the competition is measured in microseconds and there are essentially no benefits to the public at that level,'' said Lawrence E. Harris, the former chief economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and now a professor at the University of Southern California.
High-speed trading firms have thrived in the computerized markets and now account for more than half of all stock trading, up from 26 percent in 2006, according to the Tabb Group, a financial markets research firm. But even many of them acknowledge that they are engaged in an arms race that is delivering diminishing returns.
Manoj Narang, the founder of Tradeworx, said that the competition had become ''a tax'' on computerized trading firms like his. Mr. Narang says he thinks that his competitors are dedicating fewer resources to the race as they see there is little more to be gained.
But Mr. Narang said that investors had already enjoyed enormous benefits from the market's increasing sophistication and were likely to see more in the future in ways that might not be immediately obvious.
''The march of technology does not happen one step forward every year,'' Mr. Narang said.
The concerns about an evolving market have been around since the invention of the telegraph allowed cross-continental trading. But they entered another level with a series of regulatory changes beginning in 1998 that opened the market to computerized trading and new exchanges.
When the so-called specialists on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange had to compete with computers, they had to lower their prices to stay in business, and the cost of trading for investors immediately went down. Technology also facilitated a sharp jump in the number of shares traded on a daily basis -- a concept known in the industry as liquidity -- making it easier for mutual funds to get in and out of stocks.
Even the harshest critics of the current system say that many of the developments over the last two decades came with advantages for wide parts of the investing community.
''No one is saying that we go back to the floor specialists,'' said Clive Williams, the head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price Group.
But the pace of innovation has not slowed. The new software that Knight rolled out so disastrously was only the most obvious sign of the feverish competition that is continuing to reshape the markets.
Trading firms are constantly rewriting their software to keep up with the evolving rules of the nation's stock exchanges. The exchanges, in turn, are making changes to the rules and systems to keep up with the dozens of unorthodox trading platforms that have sprung up as a result of the regulatory changes.
All the industry players are also racing to update their physical infrastructure. The exchanges are consolidating their servers in data warehouses run by companies like Equinix so that the cables between them can be as short as possible and the trade data can travel faster.
For trades that have to move between the financial centers of Chicago and New York, some firms have found that data moves too slowly through fiber optic cables. In response, several companies are currently developing networks to transmit data by microwave.
The length of time that it takes to execute a trade on the New York Stock Exchange's most popular platform has dropped from 3.2 seconds to 48 milliseconds, according to Celent.
There have been obvious beneficiaries of these developments. There are the high-speed trading firms, which use fast data connections to detect tiny differences between stocks on different exchanges and can act much faster than long-term investors on market-moving news.
The companies producing the cables and computers have also made profits, and the traditional exchanges have made more money by selling their own trading technology.
But the risks of making such frequent changes have become increasingly evident. Before Knight's problem, the third-largest exchange, BATS Global Markets, gave investors a jolt in March when new software for bringing companies public failed on the day BATS took its own stock public. When problems do occur they can spread more quickly, as they did during the so-called flash crash of 2010.
These perils have been one factor scaring investors away from American stocks. They have also been put off by a market that has delivered almost no returns over the last decade because of asset bubbles and instability in the global economy.
When attention has turned to the risks of the computerized market, the new trading sites and high-speed trading firms have managed to fend off critics by pointing to benefits that long-term investors have derived from the sophisticated markets.
One of the most popular ways to gauge how investors are doing is the difference between the price at which a stock can be bought and sold at a given moment -- the so-called bid-ask spread. When this goes down, day traders, mutual funds and other institutional investors pay less to move in and out of stocks.
Credit Suisse Trading Strategy has tracked a long decline in the spreads paid on American stocks, except in periods of volatile trading, when spreads tend to temporarily rise.
Several reasons have been given for the declining spreads, but much of the credit has been given to the competition between exchanges for customers, and the competition between high-speed trading firms to offer the best price.
In recent months, however, Credit Suisse has found that spreads have been rising even under calm trading conditions.
Studies of transaction costs, like the one conducted by Abel/Noser, incorporate both the bid-ask spread and the commission charged by brokers. Over time, these have generally moved down in tandem but they have leveled off recently. Analysts have only just begun to consider why these costs to investors have stopped going down, and do not have clear answers.
Terrence Hendershott, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said he had been an advocate for technological innovation in the past, but had begun to wonder if the continuing battle for technological superiority had become too much.
''You've got arguably too many people, in too small a space, and they just keep spending enormous amounts of money,'' Professor Hendershott said. ''Can I convince myself that we are really seeing a lot of benefits? No.''

HEADLINE: Scrutiny for Casino Mogul's Frontman in China

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO, NEIL GOUGH and EDWARD WONG; Michael Luo reported from New York, Neil Gough from Macau and Hong Kong, and Edward Wong from Beijing and Shenzhen, China. Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Macau and Hong Kong, and Louise Story from New York. Research was contributed by Mia Li and Sue-Lin Wong from Beijing, Xu Yan from Shanghai, and Kitty Bennett from Seattle.

 BODY:
When Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate, needed something done in China, he often turned to his company's ''chief Beijing representative,'' a mysterious businessman named Yang Saixin.Mr. Yang arranged meetings for Mr. Adelson with senior Chinese officials; acted as a frontman on several ambitious projects for Mr. Adelson's company, the Las Vegas Sands Corporation; and intervened on the Sands's behalf with Chinese regulators. Mr. Yang even had his daughter take Mr. Adelson's wife, Miriam, shopping when she was in Beijing.
''Adelson and I had a good relationship,'' Mr. Yang said in a recent interview in Hong Kong. ''He should thank me.''
Mr. Yang joined the Sands in 2007 as the company worked to protect its interests in Macau, where its gambling revenues were mushrooming, and pressed ahead with plans for a resort in mainland China. Boasting of ties to the People's Liberation Army and China's security apparatus, Mr. Yang was hired for his guanxi, that mixture of relationships and favors that is critical to opening doors in China, according to former executives. 
But today, Mr. Yang, along with tens of millions of dollars in payments the Sands made through him in China, is a focus of a wide-ranging federal investigation into potential bribery of foreign officials and other matters in China and Macau, according to people with direct knowledge of the inquiries.
The investigations are unfolding as Mr. Adelson has become an increasing presence in this year's presidential election, contributing at least $35 million to Republican groups. On Tuesday, Mitt Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, is to appear at a fund-raiser at the Sands's Venetian casino in Las Vegas; Mr. Adelson is likely to attend, a person close to him said.
In the political arena, Mr. Adelson is perhaps best known as a hawkish defender of Israel. But whatever the outcome of the inquiries involving his businesses in China, an examination of those activities suggests a keen interest in Washington's China policy and highlights the degree to which politics and profits are often intertwined for Mr. Adelson.
The Sands has faced a conundrum in China as a casino company whose fortunes are heavily dependent on its operations in a country where gambling is illegal, except in Macau. The company relies on the good will of Chinese officials, who mete out approvals and have the power to curtail the flow of mainland visitors. As a result, Mr. Adelson has sought to use financial clout and connections to exert political influence at the highest levels of government.
On the front lines of those efforts was Mr. Yang, who was paid $30,000 a month by the company before he was fired in 2009, he said. At times, he acted as Mr. Adelson's personal guide to the Chinese establishment. Among the dignitaries he took Mr. Adelson to see was Wan Jifei, a leading international trade official whose father had been vice premier. That led to a lunch with other trade officials at the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square.
The Sands later hired Mr. Wan's daughter, Bao Bao, a socialite and jewelry designer, to do public relations. And the trade agency Mr. Wan ran became a partner in the Sands's biggest venture, the Adelson Center for U.S.-China Enterprise.
Mr. Yang denies resorting to bribery and says he actually lost money on his dealings with the Sands.
''I'm really being bullied because I helped Venetian and Adelson do so many things,'' he said. ''I'm in the middle, and on both sides everybody's pointing at me.''
The broad outlines of the mainland China investigation were reported last week by The Wall Street Journal. But a review of more than a thousand pages of corporate records in China, as well as interviews with former Sands executives and others, provides a more detailed picture.
The documents show that the Sands paid out more than $70 million to companies tied to Mr. Yang for the trade center and for a Chinese basketball team the Sands sponsored. But several million dollars appear to be unaccounted for after the projects were suddenly shut down by the company, The New York Times found.
What became of any missing money and whether any of it wound up in the hands of Chinese officials are among the questions being examined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Compounding the Sands's legal headaches in China, several of the company's subsidiaries came under investigation by Chinese regulators, resulting in a $1.6 million fine, according to Chinese and American corporate records. Mr. Yang said the penalty might have been much higher, but he ''coordinated the matter'' with the agency.
Federal investigators began looking into the Sands's China activities after the former president of the company's Macau operations filed a wrongful-termination lawsuit in 2010. The former executive, Steven C. Jacobs, charged, among other things, that he had been pressured to exercise improper leverage against government officials in Macau, and that the company had turned a blind eye to Chinese organized crime figures operating in its casinos. (The Jacobs lawsuit raised questions about payments to another well-connected local figure -- a lawyer and legislator in Macau -- that were recently explored by ProPublica and are also part of the federal bribery investigation.)
The Sands declined to respond to a detailed list of questions provided by The Times more than a week ago, saying in a statement that it was cooperating with the inquiries and was confident that once they were concluded ''no current member of senior management will have been found to have been involved in wrongdoing.''
'Las Vegas of the Far East'
In mid-2000, Richard Suen, a Hong Kong businessman, met with Mr. Adelson in the lobby of the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong to relay some urgent news. China, which had recently assumed control of Macau -- a former Portuguese colony opposite Hong Kong on the south China coast -- was ending the gambling monopoly of the tycoon Stanley Ho and would be taking bids for a limited number of gambling licenses.
Mr. Adelson peppered Mr. Suen with questions. According to testimony by Mr. Suen, who sued the Sands after his relationship with the company soured, Mr. Adelson made a bold prediction: ''I can turn Macau into the Las Vegas of the Far East.''
The company set out to cultivate Chinese officials. In the summer of 2001, Mr. Adelson and William P. Weidner, then the Sands's president, flew to Beijing for meetings arranged by Mr. Suen.
Chinese leaders at the time were worried about a pending House resolution condemning the country's bid for the 2008 Olympic Games because of its human rights record. According to Mr. Weidner's deposition in the Suen case, Mr. Adelson promised Beijing's mayor he would do what he could. Mr. Adelson called his friend Tom DeLay, then the House majority whip, catching him at a Fourth of July barbecue. Mr. DeLay said he would check on the bill's status. Several hours later, Mr. DeLay called and told Mr. Adelson he was in luck. The resolution was stuck behind a series of other bills.
''So you tell your mayor it can be assured that this bill will never see the light of day,'' Mr. DeLay said, according to Mr. Weidner.
The next morning, the Sands executives met with Qian Qichen, a Chinese vice premier, at the Purple Light Pavilion, where the government's leaders greet foreign dignitaries. Mr. Qian suggested he would ensure a limitless supply of gamblers to Macau.
In May 2004, the Sands Macau became the enclave's first foreign-owned casino. On opening day, a mob estimated at 20,000 pushed over crowd-control barriers, ripping doors off their hinges. In its first year, the casino's profits exceeded its $265 million cost.
By 2007, when the Sands opened its second casino in Macau, the $2.4 billion Venetian -- the largest casino in the world -- the formerly crime-infested backwater had become the world's undisputed gambling capital. With Macau providing two-thirds of the company's revenues, Mr. Adelson had become one of the richest men in the world.
He had wider ambitions still. The Sands was hoping for government approval for a plan to cross over into the mainland by building a 1,300-acre resort on Hengqin Island near Macau.
A Sands promotional brochure circulated in China highlighted an endorsement from Hu Jintao, China's president, as well as meetings Mr. Adelson and Mr. Weidner had with Mr. Qian, the vice premier, and other top Chinese officials. The Sands also hosted a promotional forum in late 2006, called Venetian Nights, at the Great Hall of the People.
The gambling boom, though, was stoking suspicion among Chinese officials, who feared the corrupting influence of money sloshing through Macau.
The Sands pursued a strategy of engaging Beijing. It stepped up participation in China-related programs with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and hired Myron Brilliant, its senior vice president for international affairs, as a consultant. He suggested establishing a trade center, to help American businesses pursue opportunities in China. Not only could the center funnel convention traffic to Macau, but it could also foster better relations with Chinese officials.
To carry out its China campaign, the Sands needed a man in Beijing. It hired Yang Saixin.
The Intermediary
Mr. Yang, 60, is a laconic, deliberative man who appears to eschew the nouveau riche lifestyle embraced by many Chinese businesspeople. He did a stint with the People's Liberation Army as a young man and, in his 30s, was involved in ventures across the country, from amusement parks to a concrete plant. Today, he carries a mainland Chinese passport and a Hong Kong identity card, and also goes by the Cantonese name Yeung Tsoi-san.
He told one Sands executive that he had won the attention of generals as a star basketball player in the army and had connections to a central government security agency. But Wu Bang, a journalist who interviewed Mr. Yang many times, said Mr. Yang was a minor athlete in the army who had headed the workers' union in a military factory, and did not seem to have any special military or security connections. In a recent interview, Mr. Yang backed away from any claims of ties to a security agency and said he was not a regular enlisted man but had been invited by an army unit to play and coach basketball.
Mr. Yang was running a soccer club in the boomtown of Shenzhen when he heard about the company's plans for nearby Hengqin Island. Looking for sponsors, he said, he contacted a Sands executive and started working with the company on a variety of projects. In summer 2007, his team wound up playing an exhibition match hosted by the Sands against Manchester United, of the English Premier League. It was around that time that Mr. Yang was formally named chief Beijing representative.
Mr. Yang said his main job was setting up meetings and making introductions. It was an introduction to the chairman of the state-owned China International Travel Service that led the Sands to find space for the Adelson Center in the travel service's building in central Beijing.
The Sands, though, could not buy the property outright, because of restrictions on foreigners buying commercial real estate. Instead, the Sands decided to ''lie to the Chinese government,'' said Mr. Yang, using him and three associates as frontmen for a cluster of companies anchored by Beijing Chiya Trading, which bought the space with money from the Sands. ''On paper and in the eyes of the law we were shareholders, but in actuality we were just like hired laborers,'' he said.
Another piece of the Sands's charm offensive was buying a basketball team.
Again, Mr. Yang assumed the role of intermediary. The company set its sights on the financially struggling Shaanxi Topsun, hoping to move the team to Shenzhen, not far from Macau. Fans could hop the ferry to gamble, and some games could be held in the Venetian Macau's 15,000-seat arena.
Word of a deal trickled out in Chinese press reports in the spring of 2007, alerting Li Yuanwei, then China's basketball commissioner, who wrote in a 2010 memoir that he found it ''completely unacceptable'' for a gambling company to be involved in basketball.
To win his approval for the purchase, Mr. Li said in the memoir and a recent interview, Mr. Yang and his Chinese associates resorted to blackmail and bribery. Mr. Li said they threatened him with a lawsuit based on a secret recording of a meeting about the sale. In June 2007, Mr. Li was invited to a dinner arranged by a sports journalist known to Mr. Yang. Mr. Li sent a colleague. Mr. Yang's aides were present, as was an artist who handed a painting of a tiger to the basketball league official as a gift. Later, Mr. Yang's associates informed Mr. Li that the painting was worth about $4,000, Mr. Li said.
''They later said to me: 'Now you're in possession of the painting, and it's worth this much. Either you have to pay us back that money, or we'll go over your head and say you took a painting worth that much,' '' Mr. Li said. Mr. Yang said he was not involved in the matter, calling the painting ''just a gift between friends.''
Corporate filings show the Sands wound up pursuing a slightly different path. Two Sands subsidiaries paid Mr. Yang about $9.7 million for advertising, sponsorship and naming rights for the team, as opposed to outright ownership. The team name changed to Venezia Arena, or ''Weilixin,'' a Mandarin transliteration of ''Venetian.''
China Projects Dropped
The Adelson Center had been scheduled to open on Aug. 8, 2008 -- an auspicious date in Chinese numerology -- in time for the Olympics. But renovations dragged on, and the project was abruptly abandoned in September 2008. The center's chief financial officer, Chu Jiangbin, said he was told suddenly one day to fire the more than 20 employees.
Around the same time, the Sands cut its ties to the Shaanxi basketball team and announced it had ''indefinitely'' suspended plans for Hengqin Island.
Company officials said they folded their mainland ventures for purely financial reasons. The global credit crisis had hit the company hard, and Beijing had begun clamping down on the flow of gamblers to Macau. The Sands pressed the United States Embassy in Beijing to lobby Chinese officials to change the policy, and Mr. Adelson had to put about $1 billion into the company to help it avoid defaulting on its loans.
But the China projects had also become enmeshed in legal and political complications. The first allegations about missing money surfaced when a former basketball-team employee told the Sands that Mr. Yang was double-dealing, charging the company an inflated price for the sponsorship and pocketing the difference.
In Macau, the finance executive who kept the books for the Sands's China projects also raised questions about Mr. Yang after she noticed irregularities in payments for the basketball team and the trade center, according to people familiar with the events. The executive, Yvonne Mao, left the company soon after but remained on the payroll for more than a year, for reasons that are not entirely clear. She refused to comment.
A review of corporate records shows that Mr. Yang's company, Chiya, paid 310 million renminbi, or about $41 million at the time, to buy more than 200,000 square feet of space for the Adelson Center. A pair of Sands subsidiaries in China transferred 329.77 million renminbi to Chiya in return for the rights to use the building, the records show. The Sands also spent about $19 million to renovate the center.
But after the deal fell apart, Chiya refunded only 290.82 million renminbi to the Sands, or about $6 million less than it had paid for the property alone.
An auditor's report said the Sands subsidiary that held the naming rights to the basketball team had a sharp reversal in 2008 because of ''a change in the economic environment'' and wrote off its entire $9.7 million investment.
Such discrepancies prompted internal inquiries by lawyers for the Sands.
In addition, some Sands subsidiaries had come under investigation by China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange for a variety of violations, including using money for business purposes other than those reported to the authorities. The Ministry of Commerce and Chinese courts froze the bank accounts and corporate registrations of some Sands subsidiaries, filings show.
Sands officials were told that the consequences of the SAFE investigation could be hefty. ''Laws relating to foreign exchange and regulations promulgated by SAFE, as well as other laws (such as those relating to corrupt practices) that might be applicable, allow for criminal prosecution of those in charge of, or responsible for, violations,'' warned a January 2009 memo from a law firm that handled legal issues for the company in China. The Sands and its executives were in a ''very dangerous situation,'' according to the document.
The company faced a potential fine of up to $30 million, Mr. Yang said, until he helped get it reduced to $1.6 million.
There was also growing anger toward Mr. Adelson from government officials in Beijing and Macau, according to former executives and others with direct knowledge of the matter. Mr. Adelson's mercurial personality had managed to alienate many in Macau's government. Beijing officials' ire was aroused when Mr. Adelson's 2001 private meeting with China's vice premier was revealed during the 2008 Suen trial.
The episode represented a loss of face for the Beijing leadership, and one person close to the situation said the resulting push-back indicated Mr. Adelson had worn out his welcome in China.
In September 2008, a Sands lawyer asked the United States ambassador to China, Clark T. Randt Jr., to help arrange a meeting for Mr. Adelson with Vice President Xi Jinping, according to e-mails provided to The Times. But Mr. Randt relayed that the Chinese ambassador had told him a ''lawsuit involving Congress'' -- apparently the Suen case -- would make it difficult.
A Messy Breakup in Beijing
The Sands's breakup with its chief Beijing representative proved messy. Mr. Yang said he was suddenly dismissed in early 2009 by the Sands's head of Asian development, Eric Chiu, who said only that the firing had been ordered from company headquarters. A dispute between the Sands and Mr. Yang over repayment of money paid for the Adelson Center was eventually settled in court in Beijing.
It is unclear what ultimately became of the internal Sands inquiry into Mr. Yang and the missing money.
''In the end, the company's hasty exit from China caused bookkeeping errors, but multiple investigations have not found evidence of corrupt payments,'' said Mr. Weidner, the former Sands president, who was a major driver of the China engagement strategy.
A little-noticed transaction last month in Macau hinted that Mr. Yang has become problematic for the Sands. Ms. Mao, the finance executive, had also raised concerns about a contract Mr. Yang helped arrange for the operation of Sands's ferry between Hong Kong and Macau -- another venture being looked into by federal investigators. Last month, the Sands redid the agreement, cutting out a company tied to an associate of Mr. Yang. When asked why, a ferry official said, ''It's top secret.''
Today in Beijing, the first floor of the building that housed the trade center is a car showroom, stocked with shiny black sedans. An employee said that he remembers a sign that was removed. It said ''Adelson Center'' in Chinese.
But Mr. Adelson has hardly retreated. Sands executives say a renewed strategy of engaging with Beijing has improved relations. The Sands now has four casinos in Macau, which supply about half the company's profits.
Its business continues to be vulnerable to policy machinations in Beijing over issues as narrow as visa approvals and as sweeping as currency valuation. And, to some degree, that also makes the company dependent on American policy and attitudes toward China.
As Mr. Adelson has emerged as perhaps the biggest donor in the presidential race, he has remained defiant about the legal questions swirling around his company.
Asked about them at an industry conference last year, he said, ''When the smoke clears, I am absolutely -- not 100 percent, but 1,000 percent -- positive that there won't be any fire below it.''

HEADLINE: Canadian Dollar's Strength a Factor in Autoworkers' Contract Talks

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OSHAWA, Ontario -- For many in Canada, the rise of the Canadian dollar to parity with its American counterpart is more a source of anxiety than pride.Prominent among those concerned are the 20,600 Canadian Auto Workers union members employed by the Detroit Three. Contract talks for the industry open here on Tuesday. But the dollar's high value, which most economists anticipate will continue, has more than obliterated the traditional cost advantage Canadian auto plants once enjoyed.
In 2009, when contracts were renegotiated after the rescue of General Motors and Chrysler, the Canadian dollar was worth about 78 American cents. Last week, it traded briefly at just over $1.
Regardless of the outcome of those talks, the strong currency, and higher wages for Canadian workers, seem likely to continue the shrinking of the Canadian auto industry since its peak in 1999. The underlying issue is how much that decline will continue. 
Detroit automakers have been scaling back their operations in Canada at a growing pace even as they add workers and shifts in the United States.
Last September, Ford Motor Company of Canada closed a plant that made taxis, police cruisers and Lincoln Town Cars, eliminating 1,500 jobs. General Motors of Canada plans to close one of two assembly plants in this city east of Toronto and will move some of its production to a mothballed Saturn plant in Tennessee, laying off another 2,000 workers. The future of other Canadian auto factories, including Chrysler's vast minivan plant in Windsor, Ontario, remains murky.
Over all, factory closings by the Detroit automakers have lowered Canada's vehicle production from three million cars and trucks in 1999 to 2.1 million last year, despite offsetting factory openings and expansions by the Canadian arms of Toyota and Honda.
The number of Canadian Auto Workers members employed by the Detroit Three has fallen by 28,200 over that time. In 2011, a booming year for North American car sales, production grew by 3.2 percent in Canada, 14.4 percent in Mexico and 11.5 percent in the United States.
While a number of factors have led to Canada's steady decline as an automaker, the new contracts for the C.A.W. workers will probably play a critical role in determining Detroit's future investment plans in the country.
That prospect is not lost on Joel Smith, a 22-year veteran of General Motors of Canada's assembly operation here, which covers, at least for now, nine million square feet.
''The rhetoric going into the negotiations from both sides is always that 'This is the most important set that we've ever had,' '' said Mr. Smith, who is currently on leave from the assembly line to serve as a union organizer. ''But, you know, we're not at the crossroads. We're well past the crossroads and this is going to determine if we have a future as a company in Canada.''
The historically low value of the Canadian dollar, government-provided health care and other factors once made Canada an attractive and comparatively cheap place to make cars.
That reputation has vanished.
''Canada is the most expensive place to build a car in the world right now,'' Daniel F. Akerson, the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, told a news conference after the company's annual meeting in June.
While none of the three American automakers are threatening to abandon Canada if they do not receive substantial concessions in the contract talks, they have all made it clear that they need to reduce labor costs, mainly to offset the rise of the Canadian dollar.
''With the dollar at par, we can see fairly clearly what the Canadian landscape looks like in North America,'' said a Ford Canada executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''When labor costs are unequal, it makes it more difficult to make the business case for Canada.''
The Ford executive said Canadian labor costs, including benefits, are about $79 an hour, compared with $64 an hour for American employees, assuming the two currencies are of equal value.
Ford will not be seeking a two-tiered wage structure, as it has at its American plants, a concept strongly opposed by the Canadian union. But the executive declined to indicate how else the company would try to narrow the labor cost gap in the next contract.
In a statement, G.M. Canada echoed the concerns at Ford.
''In a highly competitive global marketplace, we cannot sit still as the rest of the world races forward, particularly with rising commodity prices, a higher Canadian dollar and other cost pressures,'' the company said.
Chrysler Canada, which is based in Windsor, declined to comment on the coming talks. But Sergio Marchionne, Chrysler's chairman and chief executive, who was raised in Canada and educated in Windsor, said last week in a conference call with analysts that the company would seek an agreement ''that makes sense given the economic environment and the differences between Canada and the United States on manufacturing costs.''
The three automakers have separate contracts, which expire Sept. 17. As in the United States, a pattern contract is typically negotiated, with specifics varying by company.
The Canadian Auto Workers' members are much more militant in their opposition to concessions than their counterparts in the United Automobile Workers. Indeed, the two unions broke apart in 1985 over the issue after a strike at General Motors of Canada the previous year.
Ken Lewenza, the president of the Canadian Auto Workers, said that while he accepted that costs had risen in Canada, he rejected the argument that labor contracts were to blame.
''Most of the things they talk about are things we don't have a lot of control over,'' Mr. Lewenza said. He added that when the value of the Canadian dollar was low, ''we never, ever took advantage of that.''
Mr. Smith, the Oshawa G.M. worker, shared that view.
''At one time, when the dollar was 62 cents, I don't remember them opening up a whole host of auto plants here,'' he said. ''They always have an excuse for us having to take less.''
Mr. Lewenza defined the union's goals more in terms of what it wanted to avoid than what it would be seeking.
''The days of sacrifice bargaining are over,'' he said. ''If the talks are solely based on today's environment and today's challenges related to the Canadian dollar, then we're going to have a clash.''
The union, he added, would push for ''security of employment'' in the talks.
Looming over the negotiations is the union's defeat earlier this year at Caterpillar's locomotive factory in London, Ontario, once owned by General Motors. Caterpillar closed the factory after members rejected the company's demands for sweeping concessions and went on strike. The factory's production was moved to nonunion plants in the United States and South America.
Such sharp confrontation is unlikely to occur in the auto talks, even in the event of a strike. Chrysler and General Motors agreed to allocate a minimum percentage of their North American production to Canada until the end of 2016 as part of the 2009 bailout deal in which the governments of Canada and Ontario contributed $10.5 billion to help the companies. That commitment, however, does not mandate employment levels or prevent plant closings.
While Ford is not bound by such constraints, few observers expect it to follow Caterpillar's lead.
Not all exchange rates are working against Canada. The record high value of the yen contributed to Toyota's announcement last month that it would hire another 400 workers and invest $100 million in one of its Canadian factories. Toyota and Honda, which are not unionized, together account for about 40 percent of Canadian auto production.
Anthony J. Faria, the co-director of the office of automotive research at the University of Windsor's business school, said that it was highly unlikely that any of the American automakers would try to win enough concessions from the C.A.W. to equalize labor costs in the two countries. Such a step would most likely lead to strikes, a disruption no carmaker can afford when sales are robust.
Instead of wage rollbacks or a new wage structure, Professor Faria said he expected the final agreements to introduce a wide range of smaller changes in work rules and benefits that would still leave a sizable gap with American labor costs.
Such a result, he said, will only be a short-term victory for the union, with further plant closings likely.
''At Caterpillar, that situation looked decreed from the start,'' he said. ''In the auto industry, it will be a slower situation.''

HEADLINE: Obama Rejoins Campaign Trail in Iowa and Finds a Brand-New Rival There

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and TRIP GABRIEL; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- President Obama and Representative Paul D. Ryan went head-to-head Monday for the first time since Mr. Ryan ascended to the Republican presidential ticket.In an early test of themes that will undoubtedly dominate the campaign in the remaining months, the two men parried on welfare, the unemployment rate and the role of government. Mr. Obama painted his rival as a conservative ideologue whose refusal to compromise has led to the Washington gridlock that has alienated many Americans.
During Mr. Obama's first full day of campaigning since Mr. Ryan joined Mitt Romney on the G.O.P. ticket, the president used an appearance in Council Bluffs to target Mr. Ryan squarely. ''I am told Governor Romney's new running mate is in Iowa today,'' Mr. Obama said, to jeers from the crowd of 4,300 gathered in a park here. ''He is one of the leaders of Congress standing in the way'' of passage of a farm bill.
The president added, ''If you happen to see Congressman Ryan, tell him how important this farm bill is to Iowa and our rural communities.'' 
Mr. Ryan, who did not engage on the issue of farm aid, went after the president's biggest political vulnerability. ''As you see the president come through on his bus tour, you might ask him the same question that I'm getting asked from people all around America,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''And that is: 'Where are the jobs, Mr. President?' ''
The two men missed going mano a mano at the State Fairgrounds, with Mr. Obama visiting in the evening after Mr. Ryan appeared early in the afternoon on the famous political soapbox for brief remarks, during which he was heckled as he spoke to a generally supportive crowd. ''We are the 99 percent!'' some protesters shouted. Two women tried to climb onstage but were hustled away by security officers before they could unfurl a banner.
Mr. Ryan, of Wisconsin, tried to make light of it. ''It's funny, because Iowans and Wisconsinites, we like to be respectful of one another,'' he said. ''These ladies must not be from Iowa or Wisconsin.''
The president, by contrast, waited until the end of the day to make his appearance and steered clear of the freewheeling give and take of the soapbox. Instead, Mr. Obama shook hands with supporters and quickly acquired an ''Iowa State Fair, Nothing Compares'' baseball hat, which he unfolded and put on. He was accompanied by Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former governor of Iowa.
Mr. Obama's remarks in Council Bluffs, coming as he opened his three-day bus tour through Iowa, the state that catapulted his first campaign for the presidency, dovetailed with the barrage of criticism his campaign unleashed Monday against the Romney-Ryan ticket.
At times, the attacks made it seem as if Mr. Ryan were at the top of the Republican ticket instead of Mr. Romney. The Obama political adviser David Axelrod told ''CBS This Morning'' that while Mr. Ryan was ''a genial fellow,'' he believed his selection was similar to Senator John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin four years ago, a choice that initially generated excitement. Mr. Axelrod warned darkly that Mr. Ryan favors policies that would gut Medicare and put a greater burden on the less fortunate.
By the time Mr. Obama appeared on the podium in Council Bluffs -- just as the sun came out to dash hopes that rain would lessen the effects of the drought that has plagued farmers and ranchers here -- the president had taken up the campaign attacks against Mr. Ryan's budget policies and was running with them.
''This weekend, my opponent chose as his running mate the ideological leader'' of the conservative Republican agenda, Mr. Obama said. ''He is an articulate spokesman for Governor Romney's vision, but the problem is that vision is one which I fundamentally disagree with.''
Appearing before Mr. Obama spoke, Mr. Vilsack was even more pointed.
''Take a look at the Ryan budget,'' Mr. Vilsack said. ''Take a look at what it does to farm families. It destroys the safety net.''
The choice of Council Bluffs to open this week's bus tour is significant not only because Iowa is so critical to the president's re-election hopes, but also because it is just across the Missouri River from, and in the same television market as, Omaha. Because of Nebraska's split electoral map, the president is trying to scrape together as many votes there as he can get -- he won the state's Second Congressional District in 2008, the first time a Democrat did so since 1964, a win that gave him one electoral vote in Nebraska to Mr. McCain's four.
The president addressed the drought that has taken a toll on crops, saying he has directed the Agriculture Department to buy up to $150 million worth of meat and poultry to help relieve farmers and ranchers. The president has been pushing passage of the farm bill, but House Republican leaders chose not to bring a bipartisan, committee-passed measure to the floor before the August recess and instead passed a short-term emergency aid package that Senate Democrats refused to consider, calling it too limited.
Congressional Republicans fired back at Mr. Obama for blaming them for the failure of the farm bill.
''The weak attempt by the White House to manufacture a controversy illustrates the president's desperation to change the subject to anything other than his failures on jobs and the economy,'' said Kevin Smith, spokesman for Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio. ''The Democratic-controlled Senate left town for August without taking action on a drought aid bill that passed the House with bipartisan support, including the support of Chairman Ryan.''
Mr. Ryan's short speech in Des Moines did not address the farm bill. Instead, Mr. Ryan used his remarks to attack Mr. Obama over a ruling that Republicans say would gut the work requirement at the heart of the federal welfare law of 1996.
''The work requirement in welfare reform did more to help the poor than any reform we've had in the last generation,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''And President Barack Obama has just passed a rule waiving those work requirements, saying no longer do states actually have to have work requirements for people to receive welfare.''
The administration has said no waivers will be granted unless a state's program increases the number of aid recipients getting jobs compared to existing programs.

HEADLINE: Ryan Has Kept Close Ties to Donors on the Right

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Griff Palmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
This month, as a handful of Republicans auditioned at town halls and on bus tours to be Mitt Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan joined a private conference call. For 20 minutes, he walked through his plan to cut government spending and bashed President Obama for weakening welfare work requirements.His audience: Several hundred field organizers for Americans for Prosperity, the Tea Party-inspired group founded by the billionaire conservative philanthropists Charles and David Koch.
When Mr. Romney announced that Mr. Ryan would be his running mate, his campaign emphasized the congressman's detailed knowledge of the federal budget and his chemistry with Mr. Romney. Less well-known are Mr. Ryan's close ties to the donors and activists who have channeled Tea Party anger into a $400 million political machine, financed by a network of conservative and libertarian donors that now rivals, and occasionally challenges, the Republican establishment behind Mr. Romney.
Mr. Ryan is one of a very few elected officials who have attended the Kochs' biannual conferences, where wealthy donors sit in on seminars on runaway government spending and the myths of climate change. 
He is on first-name terms with prominent libertarians in the financial world, including hedge fund billionaires like Cliff Asness and Paul Singer, and spent his formative years immersed in the Republican Party's supply-side wing, working for lawmakers and conservative policy advocates like Jack Kemp.
He has appeared for years at rallies, town hall meetings, and donor briefings for groups like the Club for Growth, which spends millions to defeat Republicans deemed squishy on taxes and spending, and Americans for Prosperity, a grass-roots group focused on economic and budget issues that is now trying to channel Tea Party energy into a permanent electoral force. Its fourth chapter was founded in Mr. Ryan's home state, Wisconsin.
Now Mr. Ryan could provide Mr. Romney with a critical political and intellectual bridge to the rising conservative counterestablishment represented by the Kochs and their allies, who are planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars and deploy thousands of volunteers to defeat Mr. Obama. Should Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan win in November, a constituency that has for years fulminated against the failure of Republicans to live up to their own principles could soon have a close -- and powerful -- friend in the White House.
''There's three guys that we courted for president: Paul Ryan, Mitch Daniels, and Mike Pence,'' said Matt Kibbe, the president of FreedomWorks, a national advocacy group closely allied with the Tea Party, who worked alongside Mr. Ryan when both were staff aides on the House Budget Committee. ''Up until yesterday, there was a 100 percent commitment to fire Obama. There was not a lot of enthusiasm about Romney.'' Mr. Daniels is the governor of Indiana, and Mr. Pence is a congressman from Indiana.
Mr. Kibbe added, ''From a Tea Party perspective, the overwhelming response on all of our networks has been extremely positive.''
Mr. Ryan's ties to that world began with a job at Empower America, a group founded by Mr. Kemp that ran ''candidate schools'' for aspiring conservatives and advocated for a flat tax and lower spending. As a rank-and-file congressman during the presidency of George W. Bush, Mr. Ryan advocated for the privatization of Social Security, helping push the idea toward the Republican mainstream and cementing his reputation as a conservative intellectual.
Privately, Mr. Ryan would later say, he was also stewing over what he and other conservatives viewed as the Bush administration's fiscal profligacy and ideological drift, including the addition of a drug benefit to Medicare and, later, a bank bailout plan, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. (Mr. Ryan voted for both.)
That dissatisfaction was shared by the Kochs, who in the middle of the last decade began organizing conferences of like-minded donors and founded Americans for Prosperity.
Mr. Ryan, who became House budget chairman in 2006, began attending and speaking at Americans for Prosperity events. In 2008, the Wisconsin chapter gave Mr. Ryan its annual ''Defender of the American Dream'' award. Mr. Ryan also began attending the Kochs' annual donor seminars. Last spring, Mr. Ryan was a speaker at a ''Hands Off My Health Care'' rally organized by Tea Party leaders outside the Capitol, drawing enthusiastic applause.
In Congress, he emerged as a skeptic of mainstream climate change theory -- opposition to which has been a top priority of Koch-affiliated activists and research groups -- and a reliable vote against energy efficiency standards, including a House vote to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gases.
The relationship helped Mr. Ryan's campaign coffers as well as his career: the Koch Industries PAC has donated more than $100,000 to Mr. Ryan's campaigns and his leadership PAC, more than has any other corporate PAC, according to a New York Times analysis of campaign records.
Mr. Ryan has also developed relationships with other people in the Koch orbit, like Mr. Asness, a libertarian-minded financier known for his open letters blasting Mr. Obama, and Kenneth Griffin, a Chicago hedge-fund executive: wealthy donors whose taste for number-crunching and policy minutiae match Mr. Ryan's own.
Mr. Griffin and his wife, Anne, introduced Mr. Ryan to Chicago's deep-pocketed Republican donor circle -- he has raised more money there this campaign than any other city -- and promoted his budget proposals, including arranging a speech last year at the Economic Club of Chicago.
But it was Mr. Ryan's aggressive promotion of his budget plan that has cemented his place the counterestablishment's rising star. Mr. Ryan's plan, viewed warily in its early form by other Republican leaders on the Hill, became an organizing document for the Tea Party's Beltway wing, particularly the dozens of Tea Party-inspired freshman lawmakers who arrived on Capitol Hill after the 2010 elections. Many of them came to rely on Mr. Ryan for counsel on whether to accept budget compromises with Mr. Obama.
Outside political groups and research organizations praised Mr. Ryan's plan, one of the few comprehensive conservative budget proposals detailed enough to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office, as rigorous and credible.
''Paul was one of the first guys that we looked at and said, 'Hey, that young guy could be the guy,' '' said Tim Phillips, Americans for Prosperity's president. ''And when he put out the budget and defended it, that's when they said, 'He could go all the way.' ''
Officials with several outside groups that had been skeptical of Mr. Romney in the past said that the selection of Mr. Ryan had assuaged some of their doubts.
More important, they said, Mr. Ryan would fire up their grass-roots members, some of whom had doubted Mr. Romney's commitment to cutting the size of government. Last week, before the announcement, Americans for Prosperity announced that it had begun its largest ever ad campaign against Mr. Obama, a $25 million broadside in 11 battleground states.
And on Monday, Romney officials said that the campaign had raised millions of dollars in the wake of Mr. Ryan's selection, not only from grass-roots small donors, but from the many big donors who rank among his fans.

HEADLINE: Medicare Rises As Voters' Issue In G.O.P. Gamble

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Reporting was contributed by Michael Barbaro in St. Augustine, Fla.; Carlos Harrison in Miami; Fernanda Santos in Sun City, Ariz.; and Susan Saulny in Scranton, Pa.

 BODY:
TAMPA, Fla. -- With Mitt Romney's selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as his running mate, Florida quickly emerged on Monday as a critical test of the nationwide Republican gamble that concerns over the mounting federal debt can blunt potent Democratic attacks on conservative proposals to revamp Medicare.As Mr. Romney campaigned through Florida on Monday, Democrats greeted him with a barrage of assaults, including a Web advertisement featuring worried elderly voters in this battleground state. The campaign took on a more heated air as President Obama suggested in Iowa that the Republican ticket would ''end Medicare as we know it,'' a warning echoed in North Carolina by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Assailing proposed changes to the retiree health plan is a time-tested line of attack, nowhere more so than here in Florida, where voters 65 and older made up 22 percent of the electorate in the 2008 presidential election. Polls show that a majority of elderly voters nationally oppose changes in Medicare or Social Security, which Mr. Ryan in the past has also proposed altering.
The implications extend beyond Florida. Elderly voters are significant forces in Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, and Virginia and Pennsylvania, all states that could help determine the outcome of the election. 
Aides to Mr. Obama said they would focus on older voters in those states by spotlighting Mr. Ryan's proposal, broadly endorsed by Mr. Romney, to make Medicare a choice between private insurance and traditional coverage in the belief that more competition would drive down costs and improve care. Democrats say the plan, under which retirees would get a set amount of money from the government each year to purchase insurance coverage, would lead to higher costs and lower quality care for many retirees.
''I think it should be left alone,'' said Lee Berkowitz, 87, a Democrat in North Hollywood, Fla., who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 but said he has not decided whom to support in November.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan signaled that they intended to go on the offensive, challenging the assumption that Republicans were better off playing down the issue. They are gambling that anxiety about deficits, the influence of the Tea Party movement and changing demographics will give them a chance to convince voters that the time has come to confront the rapidly mounting costs of sustaining entitlement programs. Mr. Ryan is scheduled to visit Florida this month.
''Every even-numbered year in Florida, seniors are accustomed to Mediscare tactics; that's what Democrats do,'' said Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney. ''The fact is, we're going to go on offense here. Because the president has raided the Medicare trust fund to the tune of $716 billion to pay for a massive expansion of government known as Obamacare.''
''There won't be a single senior citizen in Florida who won't know that by November,'' he said.
Republican candidates have gained experience in campaigns where Democrats have focused on Mr. Ryan's Medicare proposal -- in Congressional races in Nevada and New York -- and have developed what they think is an effective way to counter it. That strategy includes assailing Mr. Obama's health care plan, and noting that it was paid for in part by taking over $700 billion from Medicare.
''The president's idea, for instance, for Medicare was to cut it by $700 billion,'' Mr. Romney said at a rally in St. Augustine. ''That's not the right answer. We want to make sure we preserve and protect Medicare.''
Key to a push-back, Republican officials said, is using elderly surrogates -- like a candidate's parents -- to counter the idea that the party's approach is heartless or would leave retirees worse off.
Mr. Ryan has already begun noting that his mother, a Medicare recipient, lives in southern Florida.
Mr. Romney's advisers argued that Mr. Ryan's proposal was nuanced enough, since it would not apply to anyone currently on, or soon to go on, Medicare, to partly blunt Mr. Obama's attacks.
For all that, even Republicans said the choice of Mr. Ryan had not made Mr. Romney's task in Florida any easier, particularly because he passed over Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, for the slot. ''Ryan Could Hurt Romney in Florida,'' read the banner headline on Sunday in The Miami Herald.
''It puts the state in play,'' said Joseph Gaylord, a Republican consultant who lives here. ''Rubio would have been the best candidate.''
And in Des Moines, on his first solo outing as a member of the ticket, Mr. Ryan was heckled on the issue as he tried to speak at the Iowa State Fair, an indication of the intensity of the battle ahead for him.
Still, Mr. Gaylord said: ''It's a legitimate argument if it's an argument that goes unanswered. But you go on the offensive on it -- the truth is, it's not going to affect any current seniors -- and get that into every discussion about health care you have.''
Democrats said the opening they saw on the issue was reflected in the aggressive way they had moved to hang Mr. Ryan's budget over Mr. Romney's candidacy.
''It's pretty powerful,'' said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who is also head of the Democratic National Committee. ''We have the largest population of seniors in the country. If we go with the Romney-Ryan plan to end Medicare as we know it, you are going to jeopardize the lives of seniors, and you are going to jeopardize the Florida economy.''
The key question, analysts said, is whether Mr. Ryan's argument about runaway federal spending and deficits would appeal to younger voters who might be worried that at the current trajectory, Medicare will soon become financially unsustainable or a giant burden on future generations.
''The truth is we simply cannot simply continue to pretend like a Medicare on track to go bankrupt at some point is acceptable,'' Mr. Romney said at a news conference in Miami. ''We must take action to make sure that we can save Medicare for coming generations.''
Brad Coker, the managing director of the Mason-Dixon poll, said Republicans might be helped by the unpopularity of Mr. Obama's health care law.
''This will be an interesting test,'' Mr. Coker said. ''Medicare on its own has always been a powerful issue with the Democrats. This is the first time you test Medicare as an issue against the health care reform.''
The elderly population in Florida is more diverse than it was in the days of Democratic snowbirds flocking here from Brooklyn and the Bronx: There are more people who have moved from states like Iowa and Georgia, and are more likely to be Republicans and, more significantly, affluent.
''The senior vote in Florida is a lot more complicated than it used to be,'' said Matthew T. Corrigan, a political scientist at the University of North Florida. ''What Ryan does is he helps in places where you have really conservative seniors -- the Tea Party seniors if you will.''
Andrew Kohut, the director of the Pew Research Center, said national polls he had conducted had shown this was an issue of great concern for elderly voters. ''If ever there was an issue that threatens the G.O.P.'s headlock on the senior vote, this is it,'' he said.
In interviews, some voters recoiled at the idea of changing the Medicare program immediately, though many said they were open to changes for future recipients.
''I'd be strongly opposed to the idea if it were to affect me,'' Phil English, 66, a retired high school teacher, said in Sun City, Ariz. ''It's not being selfish, but we've worked for that, and we've planned for it.''
In Pennsylvania, a state that Mr. Romney is hoping to put in play, Jennie Fiorenza, 93, a retired bookbinder, spoke warmly of a program that has become a critical part of her life.
''I think Medicare is wonderful, and I couldn't do without it,'' Ms. Fiorenza said.

HEADLINE: Saving Private Romney

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- No sooner had Mitt Romney and his newly picked running mate Paul Ryan of Wisconsin dubbed themselves ''America's Comeback Team'' than President Barack Obama tweeted: ''Romney-Ryan: The Go Back Team.''Bring it on! Saving Private Romney is going to involve an ideological battle -- over the size of government, the extent of Americans' obligations to one another, even the soul of the country -- that is no less than the United States deserves. An election should not be about candidates' ''likability'' when a great nation is poised at the brink of decline. It should be a large debate, not a small one.
I had been observing the U.S. election from Europe, which knows about painful loss of power, and picked up principally a blur of slur. Now Romney has provided a spark. He has introduced a young man with conservative credentials that meet the Ayn Rand test and a whiff of the natural political animal. 
Elections often hinge on simple ideas. Reagan asked Americans: Are you better off than you were four years ago? François Hollande defeated the incumbent in France by presenting himself as the ''Monsieur Normal'' who dislikes the rich. Romney, in picking Ryan, turned the election into a vote on a core question: Who can revive America?
(The rest of the world hardly comes into it for now: Ryan's international credentials are nonexistent.)
The Romney gamble is huge because the line of Democrat attack against him and Ryan is so clear: They are the heartless would-be destroyers of Medicare, the health insurance program for retirees (who abound in battleground state Florida), and Medicaid; and they are the architects of a massive redistribution of income from bottom to top at a time when the top, unlike the middle and bottom, is doing just fine. They would offer the Bain blandishments to billionaires but bulldoze America's social compact. (Contrary to a widespread European view, it exists).
The shape of the Republican counter-attack is equally apparent: Obama, with a little bit of studious this and a touch of worthy that, has no serious plan to stop Americans living on borrowed money. The economy is stalled, unemployment high. The country, to quote Clint Eastwood's endorsement of Romney, ''needs a boost.''
Behind this battleground a mountain stands. It is composed of debt. I applaud the Ryan pick because it places front and center what the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Michael Mullen, has called the greatest long-term threat to America's national security: its debt.
A country in ever greater hock to the Chinese, unable to invest in its schools, vulnerable to creditors pulling the plug, will not resist decline in the 21st century.
This election is about American revival, stupid.
President Obama has steadied America's course, killed its greatest enemy and averted financial meltdown -- but he has not lifted the United States from its sullen mood or undermining debt habits. Behind the now looming fiscal debate lies a values debate on how to galvanize America's energies, as every great president has done. (A subtext of Romney's choice is: I'm a risk-taker and can lead.)
The president has a deficit reduction plan. It would, among other things, cut military spending, preserve Medicare, and seek cost-saving health care efficiency. It makes a lot of sense. But try naming one big idea. Anxious nations need big ideas.
Ryan has built his reputation on having big ideas to balance America's books. He is a genial guy; the geniality masks the fact that, as Norman Ornstein, the co-author of ''It's Even Worse Than It Looks,'' a book on U.S. political dysfunction, put it: ''His set of proposals are the most radical since Barry Goldwater.''
The poor, the needy, the old, college students seeking loans -- all would be worse off under Ryan's budget proposals, which would slash entitlements and turn Medicare into a voucher system. He wants a much simpler tax code: a 25 percent tax rate for higher incomes and 10 percent for lower incomes while closing the loopholes and eliminating deductions that see the very rich paying far less than 25 percent today.
Simplification would be good. There are countless ruses: Romney, my colleague James Stewart notes, has ''been faulted for treating a horse partly owned by his wife as a loss-generating passive investment, rather than as a hobby.'' (Don't get me started on Romney's treatment of animals.)
If the loopholes and deductions that left six of the richest Americans paying zero tax in 2009 -- zilch! -- are really closed, then there may indeed, as Stewart has argued, be some merit to Ryan's tax proposal. Of course that's a big if.
Romney will seek to fight the election on the values -- freedom, opportunity, personal initiative, smaller government -- that Ryan's proposals seek to embody. Obama will counter with the specifics of lacerating entitlement cuts.
We may actually get a serious debate on the greatest long-term threat to U.S. national security. Romney, in choosing Ryan, has performed at least that service. The world is so interwoven that no single nation can be its guardian or guide. But an America of restored self-belief is essential to global well-being.

HEADLINE: Municipal Bond Rule Mired in Legislative Limbo

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Financial reform was supposed to help protect local taxpayers from getting burned by municipal bond deals. But a measure that would require municipal bond advisers to put the interests of taxpayers first has been bogged down in a rule-making quagmire in Washington for nearly two years.What's more, a House bill, sponsored by Representative Robert J. Dold, Republican of Illinois, would eliminate the measure.
As part of the wide-ranging regulatory changes that followed the financial crisis of 2008, the Dodd-Frank Act included a provision that would make municipal advisers ''fiduciaries,'' meaning they must show an undivided loyalty to the communities that hire them, putting local residents' interests ahead of their own.
That's a much higher standard than the one for the banks that underwrite municipal bonds. The law in that case takes for granted that underwriters are looking out for their own interests in bond deals, and requires only that they deal fairly and not mislead. 
Making advisers fiduciaries would be ''the first time in the history of the securities laws that issuers of the securities have been protected,'' said Robert W. Doty, president of AGFS, a consulting firm in Sacramento. He is a registered municipal adviser and favors the fiduciary mandate. But before that provision can take effect, the law calls for the Securities and Exchange Commission to define ''municipal adviser.''
The S.E.C. proposed a definition 20 months ago, but it was swiftly beaten back by the banking, brokerage and engineering industries, among others. Opponents argued that the S.E.C. was overreaching and that they were already regulated and should not be given a new mandate.
In addition to serving as fiduciaries, municipal advisers would have to register with the commission, meet professional standards and allow periodic inspections. As fiduciaries, they would have to speak out when they see something amiss, even if it means going against powerful political forces and financial incentives.
Mr. Dold's bill, introduced last summer, now has 35 other sponsors from both parties. In addition to ending the fiduciary mandate, it would exclude banks and other financial institutions from being deemed municipal advisers, even though bankers often do advise municipalities. A group of engineers that provide cost-benefit studies for municipal energy projects, typically financed with bonds, has also been calling for its members to be excluded.
''As a small-business owner, I believe that it is important to correct a problem when it becomes apparent,'' Mr. Dold, who represents a district north of Chicago, said in announcing his bill. ''While the Dodd-Frank Act had good intentions, the broad scope under which it was written brings unintended consequences,'' like delays and higher costs. The jockeying over the measure continued as it was reported out of a subcommittee just before the recess in July, and the wrangling is expected to continue in September. Mr. Dold has said the fiduciary mandate could stay in the law if everyone agreed that it applied only to ''actual municipal advisers, defined as Congress intended,'' but so far there is no such agreement.
The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the municipal bond underwriters' watchdog, is flexing its muscles after getting a new mandate from Dodd-Frank to keep an eye out for local taxpayers. When it was created 37 years ago, its only mandate was to protect the investors who buy municipal bonds.
In May, the board expanded its existing fair-dealing rule, requiring underwriters to make sure local officials understand the risks of complex bond deals, and to disclose any incentives they may have for supporting certain transactions.
But those changes barely squeaked by the S.E.C., which must approve the rule-making board's actions. Two of the five commissioners, Daniel M. Gallagher and Troy A. Paredes, issued an unusual dissent, saying the board had not done enough to make sure the benefits of the expanded rules were worth the cost, which could be borne by local taxpayers.
The need to protect residents from borrowing debacles is coming increasingly into focus, as fiscal distress mounts in many communities. In some cases, poorly structured bond deals are a big part of the problem.
''What has happened to the taxpayer is just atrocious,'' said John Stoffa, the county executive of Northampton County, in rural eastern Pennsylvania, which just paid Bank of America $27 million to get out of a bond-related contract that a previous county government entered in 2004. That's more than the county's annual spending on social services to youth, children and families.
But Northampton County got off easy compared to places like Jefferson County, Ala., where imprudent bond deals figured in the biggest municipal bankruptcy in United States history, and Harrisburg, Pa., which is now in receivership.
The bonds in those places, and many others, involved derivatives that were supposed to lower the communities' borrowing costs. But the financial crisis of 2008, and the low interest rates that followed it, have changed the underlying math, forcing communities to pay more interest than expected over the remaining life of their bonds. In some cases the bonds no longer exist, but the derivative contracts are still running, costing local residents money year after year.
The S.E.C. says no comprehensive data exists on how many municipalities have been caught with such contracts, or how much they are paying.
''This has gotten much worse over the past year,'' said Craig Underwood, president of Bond Logistix L.L.C., an advisory firm that works with state and local governments. He said that last year, some of his client communities had been thinking about whether to get out of their derivatives contracts by making a large payment to a bank, the way Northampton County did. But while they hesitated, interest rates fell even lower, and now they can no longer afford the termination fees.
Had there been a fiduciary mandate a decade ago, the riskiest bond deals might not have been struck at all. And on the transactions that did go forward, a qualified municipal adviser might have taken the time to renegotiate better terms and pricing, said Andrew Kalotay, a debt-management specialist now serving on the committee that is helping draft educational requirements for municipal advisers.
''It pains me to see what's going on,'' said Mr. Kalotay.
What often happened instead was this. A trusted banker told local officials they could save money by adding derivatives to their bonds, then recommended other companies to work on the deal for contingency fees. The officials focused on the ostensible savings, without stopping to consider that none of their advisers would be paid unless the deal went through -- however unsound or overpriced it might be.
''Without the fiduciary duty, tens of thousands of local governments, hundreds of thousands of local officials, and hundreds of millions of local taxpayers and ratepayers would be at significant risk, as they have been in the past,'' said Mr. Doty, the adviser from Sacramento.

HEADLINE: Let the Real Debate Begin

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
David Brooks is off today.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's choice of Paul Ryan to be his running mate is -- do I dare say this? -- good news for lots of people. Conservative Republicans will mobilize around a deeply conservative Tea Party hero, who will help ease their essential discomfort with their presumptive presidential nominee. Democrats will try to make political hay over the shrink-the-government budget proposals that Ryan, a congressman from Wisconsin, has rolled out in the House, starting with his plan to ''save'' Medicare by essentially creating a voucher program that would inevitably cause seniors to pay for more of their own health care.But, most important, it seems to me that the Ryan pick creates the potential for the country to have the debate, in a national election, that it needs to have about the size and role of the federal government.
Ryan is, in many ways, the perfect Tea Party standard-bearer. He is likable, engaging, wonkish and smart. Although the Tea Party is fueled largely by anger, Ryan comes across as a firebrand without the heat. His personal story -- with the death of his father forcing him to become self-reliant early in life -- is inspiring. He is willing to sit down and talk to anyone, friend or foe, about his ideas. He has the ability to make his radical ideas sound reasonable. 
On the one hand, talk about limiting the federal government and shrinking the deficit has been central to Republican rhetoric for years. On the other hand, historically, most Republicans haven't really meant it. George W. Bush, for instance, pushed for a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients that added an estimated $300 billion to the federal deficit -- not to mention two budget-busting wars.
Ryan, however, means it. What sets him apart is that he is the rare politician who has been willing to put meat on the bones so that everybody can see what he has in mind. Ryan's budget plan would reduce the size of government from the current 24 percent of gross domestic product to around 20 percent of G.D.P. The ax would fall most heavily on programs for the poor. As the opinion writer Matt Miller put it recently in The Washington Post, ''Over time, Ryan's 'vision' would decimate most federal activities beyond Social Security, Medicare and defense.''
Simply dismissing these ideas as crazy is a mistake. There are many people in the country who agree with Ryan -- as they showed two years ago, when they elected 87 Republican freshmen, many of them Tea Party-backed political novices, to the House of Representatives, who went to Washington vowing to shrink the federal government. Although they have had only marginal success so far, it hasn't been for lack of trying. Their desperate urgency gave us, among other things, the debt-ceiling crisis, in which they risked putting the government in default rather than give in.
But the debt-ceiling crisis could hardly be called a national debate. Rather, it was a negotiation conducted under dire circumstances, and its resolution merely kicked the can to the so-called fiscal cliff we'll hit in January, when budget cuts will be imposed across the board unless Congress and President Obama unwind what they agreed to.
Which is why it is so important now to have a substantive debate about both President Obama's vision of the federal government's role -- and Paul Ryan's. Mitt Romney, who seems unable or unwilling to go beyond the bromides in his campaign speeches, lacks both the skill and the genuine fervor to have this debate. But, with Ryan on the ticket, it is at least possible. I think the Democrats will win this debate, but we need to have it openly, and nationally -- rather than having the shrink-the-government movement conducted as a kind of guerrilla warfare, carried out in lightning strikes like the debt-ceiling crisis.
Ever since the campaign entered the postprimary, preconvention phase, with the two candidates turning their attention to each other, it has been a depressing spectacle. The Democrats have demanded that Romney release more of his tax returns -- though we already know all we need to know. (Like every wealthy businessman, Romney works hard to minimize his taxes.) In bashing his role in running Bain Capital, the private-equity firm, the president and his aides have hammered Romney for doing what every company does: outsourcing and layoffs. Meanwhile, Romney and his team harp on the anemic economy -- even though the Republicans have spent much of the past two years preventing the president from doing anything about it.
Already the Democrats are turning their fire on Ryan and his budget plan. Fine. He and Romney will punch back. No surprise there, either. But Ryan gives the Romney campaign a central idea about government, and, with any luck, the campaign will offer us a real opportunity to think hard about what kind of government we want.
Plus, I can't remember the last time I've been so eager to watch a vice-presidential debate.

HEADLINE: Everything Wall St. Should Know About Ryan

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
He could be mistaken for a Wall Street banker. Or perhaps a hedge fund manager. Or even a managing director at a private equity firm, like Bain Capital.Paul Ryan, with his clean-cut Brooks Brothers looks and wonky obsession with spreadsheets, could be just the archetype of a Wall Streeter.
Mitt Romney's new running mate even trades stocks in his spare time. He's a fan of the nation's blue chips: among the stocks he owns are Apple, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, I.B.M., Procter & Gamble, Wells Fargo, Google, McDonald's, Nike and Berkshire Hathaway, according to his latest disclosure filing. 
Mr. Ryan is a disciple of Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman, two figures long associated with free markets.
And he has the support of some powerful backers in finance: his top donors include employees of Wells Fargo, UBS, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. For his 2012 Congressional race, he raised about $179,000 from securities professionals (not a large sum, but certainly the single largest sector that donated money to his campaign).
One of the biggest contributors to his political action committee is from Paul Singer's hedge fund, Elliott Management. And Dan Senor, recently an investment adviser to Elliott Management, was just named Mr. Romney's new adviser. But what does Mr. Ryan think about Wall Street? His views may surprise you.
Mr. Ryan, who voted in 1999 to repeal parts of the Glass-Steagall Act, allowing commercial and investment banks to merge, now appears to be in the same change-of-heart camp as Sandy Weill, the former chief executive of Citigroup, who recently declared that the banks should be broken up.
"We should make sure you can't get too big where you're going to become too big to fail and trigger a bailout," Mr. Ryan said during a meeting with constituents in May in Wisconsin. "If you're a bank and you want to operate like some nonbank entity like a hedge fund, then don't be a bank. Don't let banks use their customers' money to do anything other than traditional banking."
With a view like that, Mr. Ryan faces a challenge winning the support of the likes of Jamie Dimon, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase and a vocal supporter of the big bank model. (Mr. Dimon, a onetime supporter of President Obama, had recently been hinting he could vote for Mr. Romney, regularly calling himself "barely a Democrat.")
Mr. Ryan is also an ardent critic of the Dodd-Frank Act, the postcrisis Wall Street legislation. But, oddly enough, the provision he dislikes the most is the one that has the greatest support of the industry: a tool known as resolution authority, which gives the government the authority to dismantle a failing bank without wreaking havoc on the rest of the system. It was a provision that was supported by the former Republican Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. "We would have loved to have something like this for Lehman Brothers. There's no doubt about it," Mr. Paulson told me two years ago. The provision was also supported almost universally by Wall Street as a way to end the "too big to fail" problem.
Mr. Ryan's 2013 budget proposal sought to remove the resolution authority provision saying, "While the authors of the Dodd-Frank Act went to great lengths to denounce bailouts, this law only sustains them."
It is worth noting that Mr. Ryan voted in favor of the bank bailout in 2008, known as TARP or Troubled Asset Relief Program. Ahead of the vote, he encouraged his colleagues in the House to vote in favor of it to avoid "this Wall Street problem infecting Main Street."
He added: "This bill offends my principles, but I'm going to vote for this bill in order to preserve my principles, in order to preserve this free enterprise system. We're in this moment and if we fail to do the right thing, heaven help us."
While Mr. Ryan may appear to be a friend of business, he doesn't agree with the industry's biggest talking point these days, the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction plan. He was a member of the commission and voted it down, arguing that it did not go far enough in overhauling health care entitlements.
He later criticized President Obama for not supporting it. That prompted Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council under President Obama, to retort on CNN:
"Paul Ryan, talking about walking away from a balanced plan like Bowles-Simpson is, I don't know, somewhere between laughable and a new definition for chutzpah."
Oddly enough, Erskine Bowles, a Democrat, praised Mr. Ryan's proposed budget in a speech in 2011, saying, "I always thought that I was O.K. with arithmetic, but this guy can run circles around me."
Mr. Ryan also bucked the conventional Wall Street wisdom on how to deal with the debt ceiling. Many investment managers are wringing their hands about the uncertainty that the debate over the "fiscal cliff" is creating for markets. Last year, three months before the debt ceiling debate reached a peak, Mr. Ryan said that he was prepared to let the government default on its debt for at least several days if it would force Democrats to accept deeper cuts.
"They all say, 'Whatever you do, make sure you get real spending cuts,' " Mr. Ryan told CNBC about the way investors, including the hedge fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller, wanted him to vote. "Because you want to make sure that the bondholder has the confidence that the government's going to be able to pay them. You're putting the government in a better position to pay them."
James Pethokoukis, a columnist for the American Enterprise Institute, which has traditionally supported Mr. Ryan, sent this Twitter message in April. "I hear what G.O.P. support there was for Obama/Bowles/Simpson debt panel plan is collapsing thanks to Ryan Plan."
So while financiers may cheer Mr. Ryan's pro-market policies, they may want to reassess just what those policies mean for their businesses.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan's Fairy-Tale Budget Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID A. STOCKMAN. 
David A. Stockman, who was the director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1981 to 1985, is the author of the forthcoming book ''The Great Deformation: How Crony Capitalism Corrupts Free Markets and Democracy.''

 BODY:
Greenwich, Conn.PAUL D. RYAN is the most articulate and intellectually imposing Republican of the moment, but that doesn't alter the fact that this earnest congressman from Wisconsin is preaching the same empty conservative sermon.
Thirty years of Republican apostasy -- a once grand party's embrace of the welfare state, the warfare state and the Wall Street-coddling bailout state -- have crippled the engines of capitalism and buried us in debt. Mr. Ryan's sonorous campaign rhetoric about shrinking Big Government and giving tax cuts to ''job creators'' (read: the top 2 percent) will do nothing to reverse the nation's economic decline and arrest its fiscal collapse.
Mr. Ryan professes to be a defense hawk, though the true conservatives of modern times -- Calvin Coolidge, Herbert C. Hoover, Robert A. Taft, Dwight D. Eisenhower, even Gerald R. Ford -- would have had no use for the neoconconservative imperialism that the G.O.P. cobbled from policy salons run by Irving Kristol's ex-Trotskyites three decades ago. These doctrines now saddle our bankrupt nation with a roughly $775 billion ''defense'' budget in a world where we have no advanced industrial state enemies and have been fired (appropriately) as the global policeman. 
Indeed, adjusted for inflation, today's national security budget is nearly double Eisenhower's when he left office in 1961 (about $400 billion in today's dollars) -- a level Ike deemed sufficient to contain the very real Soviet nuclear threat in the era just after Sputnik. By contrast, the Romney-Ryan version of shrinking Big Government is to increase our already outlandish warfare-state budget and risk even more spending by saber-rattling at a benighted but irrelevant Iran.
Similarly, there can be no hope of a return to vibrant capitalism unless there is a sweeping housecleaning at the Federal Reserve and a thorough renunciation of its interest-rate fixing, bond buying and recurring bailouts of Wall Street speculators. The Greenspan-Bernanke campaigns to repress interest rates have crushed savers, mocked thrift and fueled enormous overconsumption and trade deficits.
The greatest regulatory problem -- far more urgent that the environmental marginalia Mitt Romney has fumed about -- is that the giant Wall Street banks remain dangerous quasi-wards of the state and are inexorably prone to speculative abuse of taxpayer-insured deposits and the Fed's cheap money. Forget about ''too big to fail.'' These banks are too big to exist -- too big to manage internally and to regulate externally. They need to be broken up by regulatory decree. Instead, the Romney-Ryan ticket attacks the pointless Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, when what's needed is a restoration of Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era legislation that separated commercial and investment banking.
Mr. Ryan showed his conservative mettle in 2008 when he folded like a lawn chair on the auto bailout and the Wall Street bailout. But the greater hypocrisy is his phony ''plan'' to solve the entitlements mess by deferring changes to social insurance by at least a decade.
A true agenda to reform the welfare state would require a sweeping, income-based eligibility test, which would reduce or eliminate social insurance benefits for millions of affluent retirees. Without it, there is no math that can avoid giant tax increases or vast new borrowing. Yet the supposedly courageous Ryan plan would not cut one dime over the next decade from the $1.3 trillion-per-year cost of Social Security and Medicare.
Instead, it shreds the measly means-tested safety net for the vulnerable: the roughly $100 billion per year for food stamps and cash assistance for needy families and the $300 billion budget for Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Shifting more Medicaid costs to the states will be mere make-believe if federal financing is drastically cut.
Likewise, hacking away at the roughly $400 billion domestic discretionary budget (what's left of the federal budget after defense, Social Security, health and safety-net spending and interest on the national debt) will yield only a rounding error's worth of savings after popular programs (which Republicans heartily favor) like cancer research, national parks, veterans' benefits, farm aid, highway subsidies, education grants and small-business loans are accommodated.
Like his new boss, Mr. Ryan has no serious plan to create jobs. America has some of the highest labor costs in the world, and saddles workers and businesses with $1 trillion per year in job-destroying payroll taxes. We need a national sales tax -- a consumption tax, like the dreaded but efficient value-added tax -- but Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan don't have the gumption to support it.
The Ryan Plan boils down to a fetish for cutting the top marginal income-tax rate for ''job creators'' -- i.e. the superwealthy -- to 25 percent and paying for it with an as-yet-undisclosed plan to broaden the tax base. Of the $1 trillion in so-called tax expenditures that the plan would attack, the vast majority would come from slashing popular tax breaks for employer-provided health insurance, mortgage interest, 401(k) accounts, state and local taxes, charitable giving and the like, not to mention low rates on capital gains and dividends. The crony capitalists of K Street already own more than enough Republican votes to stop that train before it leaves the station.
In short, Mr. Ryan's plan is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices. And it couldn't pass even if Republicans were to take the presidency and both houses of Congress. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have no plan to take on Wall Street, the Fed, the military-industrial complex, social insurance or the nation's fiscal calamity and no plan to revive capitalist prosperity -- just empty sermons.

HEADLINE: How the Choice of Ryan Affects the Race

 BODY:
To the Editor:Re ''The Romney Package,'' by Bill Keller (column, Aug. 13):
It is an example of Mitt Romney at his equivocating best. Representative Paul D. Ryan is chosen as a vice-presidential candidate because of his ''bold'' vision on economic reform, but then Mr. Romney advises that it is his own still unrevealed plan on which he is running. Like almost everything else in the Romney universe, there is an absence of definition.
Mr. Romney appeases those extreme voices on the far right by adding Mr. Ryan to the ticket. But he is clearly uncomfortable playing the role of right-wing ideologue. It does not suit his personality or his past politics. And so Mr. Ryan is given the task that is seemingly second nature to him. 
While the choice of Mr. Ryan does not project the same desperation as that of Sarah Palin four years ago, it does speak to the concern within the Republican Party that its presidential candidate, on his own accord, would flounder and fall short.
ROBERT S. NUSSBAUM Fort Lee, N.J., Aug. 13, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''The Romney-Ryan Plan for America'' (editorial, Aug. 13):
Mitt Romney has done America a great favor in selecting Paul D. Ryan. America must put its house in order. We simply cannot continue to borrow 42 cents on every dollar forever.
Spending must be cut, and, unlike the Republican candidates, I believe that taxes must be raised on everyone. There is no other choice if we are not to end up like some of the countries in Europe.
Are the American people patriotic enough to make the necessary sacrifices? President Obama doesn't think so. Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have taken a huge gamble in bringing up this debate.
PAUL SCHOENBAUM Williamsburg, Va., Aug. 13, 2012
To the Editor:
For those who believe that there isn't enough difference between President Obama and Mitt Romney to warrant voting this year, Mr. Romney's selection of Representative Paul D. Ryan as his running mate should get them to the polls.
Mr. Obama has not fulfilled all of his promises, and his record on issues like government secrecy and the right of habeas corpus is flawed, but the issue this year is the role of government itself. Mr. Ryan's priorities call for reducing the federal work force by 200,000 workers, transforming Medicare into a voucher program, and cutting funds for Medicaid, food stamps, student loans and other social programs.
After months of cloudy rhetoric, Mr. Romney has finally made it clear where he stands. Now it is up to us to decide whether we want a federal government dedicated to serving all Americans, or one that protects the wealthy at the expense of the poor. Whatever the outcome, we cannot say we weren't warned.
RACHELLE MARSHALL Mill Valley, Calif., Aug. 13, 2012
To the Editor:
Is picking Paul D. Ryan as his running mate a game changer for Mitt Romney? No. Data indicate that vice-presidential picks may help sink candidates (à la Sarah Palin for John McCain), but rarely do they put a significant number of votes in their column.
That said, Mr. Ryan will fire up the right-wing Republican base, and, in all fairness, he is a true intellectual, he is media savvy, he is photogenic and most voters could at least envision him as president if Mr. Romney died in office. All in all, a good, solid pick consistent with the well-reasoned and methodical thinking often ascribed to Mr. Romney.
The Democrats will predictably say Mr. Ryan's selection is pandering to Mr. Romney's far-right wing. They will portray him as a dangerous ideologue who is out of touch with Middle America, as evidenced by his budget plan, which seems to favor the rich, powerful and connected over everyday Americans.
Is there some truth to these assertions? Yes. Will such tactics tarnish Mr. Romney's choice? Stay tuned.
KEN DEROW Swarthmore, Pa., Aug. 13, 2012
To the Editor:
''Conservative Star's Small-Town Roots'' (''The Long Run'' series, front page, Aug. 13) says Representative Paul D. Ryan took a ''passionate interest'' in Ayn Rand.
Ayn Rand is like one of those childhood diseases such as measles or chickenpox: if one must, it is best to develop the enthusiasm early and outgrow it as one matures.
The reason that Mr. Ryan has ''disavowed'' Ms. Rand probably has to do with his inability to reconcile her economics with her militant atheism and contempt for Christianity.

HEADLINE: Should Candidates Talk About Climate Change?

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A survey gauging whether candidates should talk about taking action on global warming. 

 BODY:
Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication, just sent the note below about a new analysis of climate attitudes. I'm posting it here as part of a continuing effort to point to notable news and analysis out there in the firehose flood of information:
Today we are releasing a short report that draws upon data from our latest national survey (March 2012) and other research to investigate this question: On balance, will candidates for political office benefit or be harmed by talking about and supporting action to reduce global warming?
The short answer is that - at the national level and among ten key swing states - taking a pro-climate stand appears to benefit candidates more than hurt them with registered voters. Of course, the political dynamics in any given district may be an exception to this pattern, but it is important to note that the pattern is similar at both the national and swing-state scales.
A few highlights:
 A majority of all registered voters (55 percent) say they will consider candidates' views on global warming when deciding how to vote.
 Among these climate change issue voters, large majorities believe global warming is happening and support action by the U.S. to reduce global warming, even if it has economic costs.
 Independents lean toward "climate action" and look more like Democrats than Republicans on the issue.
 A pro-climate action position wins votes among Democrats and Independents, and has little negative impact with Republican voters.
 Policies to reduce America's dependence on fossil fuels and promote renewable energy are favored by a majority of registered voters across party lines.
The full report can be downloaded here: The Political Benefits of Taking a Pro-Climate Stand in 2012.
This related post is worth exploring: "Obama Ducks and Covers on Climate." Here's the core line: 
The "C-word," climate, appears to have become to the Beltway what the "P-word," population, has been in climate treaty negotiations for a long time - unmentionable.

HEADLINE: New Woodward Book Due in September

BYLINE: JULIE BOSMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The new release, called "The Price of Politics,'' will be Mr. Woodward's 17th book and will examine efforts by government leaders to restore the American economy, the publisher said. 

 BODY:
The fall books season just got a little more crowded. Bob Woodward's 17th book, "The Price of Politics,'' will be published on Sept. 11, his publisher said on Tuesday, in the splashy, embargoed style that has been a trademark of a Woodward release. 
The book is "an intimate, documented examination of how President Obama and the highest profile Republican and Democratic leaders in the United States Congress attempted to restore the American economy and improve the federal government's fiscal condition over three and one half years," the publisher, Simon & Schuster, said in a statement.
An excerpt of the book will run in The Washington Post, where Mr. Woodward is an associate editor. Mr. Woodward is expected to grant interviews to
Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos of ABC News.

HEADLINE: Data Storage Could Expand Reach of Surveillance

BYLINE: SCOTT SHANE


HIGHLIGHT: Government at every level is experimenting with sophisticated surveillance equipment whose capabilities are improving as rapidly as every other kind of electronic technology. 

 BODY:
A wave of worry about a software program called TrapWire, designed to detect terrorists casing possible targets, appears to be unjustified, as I wrote in Tuesday's Times. 
Based on stolen corporate e-mails posted by WikiLeaks, some reports hugely exaggerated the program's sweep and capabilities; the New York Police Department, for instance, says that contrary to claims on the Web, it has never used TrapWire.
But the bogus flap over one particular surveillance product should not eclipse the very real issues lurking behind it. Government at every level is experimenting with sophisticated surveillance equipment whose capabilities are improving as rapidly as every other kind of electronic technology. 
The Police Department itself, for example, just last week unveiled a new "domain awareness" system, developed with Microsoft, that links 3,000 cameras, 2,600 radiation detectors and dozens of license plate readers in six locations and mounted on cars. If officers spot a suspicious package in range of a video camera, for example, they will be able to quickly track who put it there. If a terrorist suspect's tag number is known, the network will scan passing cars to find it. 
Paul J. Browne, the Police Department's chief spokesman, said that under its privacy policy, the department will discard images after 30 days unless the images are part of an active investigation. But certainly the technology to capture and store such data is no longer a limiting factor.
Not so long ago, even the most aggressive government surveillance had to be selective: the cost of data storage was too high and the capacity too low to keep everything. 
Not anymore. John Villasenor, an electrical engineer at the University of California, Los Angeles, studied the plummeting cost of computer data storage and reached an astonishing conclusion: It will soon be technically feasible and affordable to record and store everything that can be recorded about what everyone in a country says or does. 
And there is plenty of data to store. The average person today leaves an electronic trail unimaginable 20 years ago -- visiting Web sites, sending e-mails and text messages, using credit cards, passing before a proliferating network of public and private video cameras and carrying a cellphone that reports a person's location every minute of the day. 
Mr. Villasenor, also a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, estimates that to store the audio from telephone calls made by an average person in the course of a year would require about 3.3 gigabytes and cost just 17 cents to store, a price that is expected to fall to 2 cents by 2015. Tracking a person's movements for a year, collected from their cellphone, would take so little space as to carry a trivial cost. Storing video takes far more space, but the price is dropping so steadily that storing millions of hours of material will not be a problem soon.
"It's so cheap that you can afford to throw away 99.9 percent without looking at it," says Mr. Villasenor, who explores the possibilities in a Brookings paper, "Recording Everything: Digital Storage as an Enabler of Authoritarian Governments." 
And a government sleuth would, of course, be able to efficiently find anything of interest in the data because of the parallel revolution in search technology. 
It is hard to exaggerate how dramatic the change has been. In the 1960s, the National Security Agency used rail cars to store magnetic tapes containing audio recordings and other material that the agency had collected but had never managed to examine, said James Bamford, an author of three books on the agency.
In those days, the agency used the I.B.M. 350 disk storage unit, bigger than a full-size refrigerator but with a capacity of 4.4 megabytes of data. Today, some flash drives that are small enough to put on a keychain hold a terabyte of data, about 227,000 times as much.
That kind of convenience and economy is hard to resist, whether you are a parent storing photos of your children -- or a government trying to keep an eye out for threats.

HEADLINE: Blaming Obama for George W. Bush's Policies

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's economic team ignores the record in blaming President Obama for ills created by George W. Bush's policies, particularly his tax cuts, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Although it was quickly overshadowed by his choice of Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate, Mitt Romney released an important document last week by his principal economic advisers that deserves more attention than it got. It is an audacious attempt to blame Barack Obama for the economic mistakes of George W. Bush and Republicans in Congress.
The document is attributed to economists Glenn Hubbard of Columbia, N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard, John B. Taylor of Stanford and Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute. Professors Hubbard and Mankiw each chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bush, while Professor Taylor served him as under secretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department. Mr. Hassett is co-author of the book, "Dow 36,000," published in 1999.
Much of the Romney paper is taken up with reviewing the poor economic recovery, which is undeniable. Reading it, however, one is left with the impression that the recession occurred on President Obama's watch because of policies he is responsible for.
Just to be clear, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the private research group that determines the starting and ending points of recessions, says the latest economic downturn began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009.

The report points to various causes of the recession as if they all just happened without the responsibility of one party or administration. As the report says, "No single party or administration is responsible for structural headwinds to growth."
That is probably true. But what about cyclical changes in growth and unemployment? These are the ups and downs in the economy that occur around the trend rate of growth, which is determined by structural factors, as the report correctly asserts.
Factors affecting the business cycle are necessarily short-term in nature. They include Federal Reserve policy; international capital flows; industry-specific policies such as those affecting housing; fiscal policy and many others.
Such factors must necessarily have occurred after the previous recession, which ended in November 2001, according to the N.B.E.R. That's the nature of business-cycle analysis; once a previous recession ends, the cyclical factors that gave rise to it are assumed to have been purged. The next recession will necessarily result from those factors that postdate the previous recession.
So whatever caused the 2007-9 recession had to have resulted from policies that the Bush administration was responsible for - either by initiating them or failing to act against them.
Space prohibits a full discussion of these issues, but certainly one factor had to be the squandering of budget surpluses that resulted from the policies of the Bill Clinton administration and their replacement by huge deficits under President Bush.
Mr. Bush inherited a budget surplus of $236 billion from Mr. Clinton in 2000, which fell to $128 billion in 2001. By 2002, the federal government ran a budget deficit of $158 billion, which rose to $377 billion in 2003, and $413 billion in 2004. The deficit fell to $318 billion in 2005, $248 billion in 2006, and $161 billion in 2007, then shot up to $459 billion in 2008.
It should be noted as well that the fiscal 2009 budget was submitted to Congress by Mr. Bush in January 2008 and took effect on Oct. 1 of that year - almost four months before President Obama took office.
Thus the government was running historically large budget deficits long after the end of the 2001 recession. As I have previously documented, these deficits resulted to a large extent from legislated tax cuts during the Bush years.
It is also important to note, though one will not find it in the economists' report, that much of the legislated increase in the deficit under President Obama resulted from tax cuts. According to the Congressional Budget Office, tax cuts in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 reduced revenues by $253 billion between 2009 and 2011 - about a third of the budgetary cost of the stimulus package. 
Further tax cuts agreed to by President Obama in 2010 added another $354 billion to the deficit in 2011 and a similar amount this year. Thus about $1 trillion of the deficit since 2009 came from tax cuts.
Most economists believe that running large deficits during cyclical upturns is a bad idea because they overstimulate the economy when it's not needed and thus sow the seeds of economic imbalances that lead to subsequent recessions. One can argue that George W. Bush's budgetary profligacy was a major cause of the 2007-9 recession - the longest and deepest of the postwar era.
Even if one isn't willing to go that far, it is apparent that had Mr. Bush reduced budget deficits rather than enlarging them through tax cuts and spending increases for wars, pork-barrel projects and a new entitlement program (Medicare Part D), the federal government would have had more fiscal ammunition available to fight the recession that President Obama inherited from President Bush.
Because of the large deficits Mr. Bush bequeathed Mr. Obama - on Jan. 8, 2009, the C.B.O. projected a deficit for the year of $1.3 trillion that didn't include any Obama policies - Congress was deeply reluctant to enact a stimulus larger than $787 billion, even though President Obama's economic advisers thought that one at least twice as large was necessary to turn the economy around. The opposition of every Republican to the 2009 stimulus was a major factor in its inadequate size.
By way of analogy, suppose you go to your doctor with an illness. He correctly diagnoses it and prescribes the right medicine, but for some reason you are given a dosage only half as large as required. The medicine was enough to improve your condition, but not enough to cure you. You remain sick although you feel better and will remain so until you finally get a full dosage of the proper medicine or your body is able to cure itself, which might take years.
Note that in this analogy the medicine was properly prescribed; only the dosage was wrong. It would be incorrect to blame the medicine because you are still sick.
The Republican economists nevertheless blame the medicine itself for the failure of the economy to respond to President Obama's prescription. 
But it was Republican policies during the Bush administration that brought on the sickness and Republicans in Congress who have denied the economy an adequate dosage of the cure. Now they want to implicitly blame President Obama for causing the recession and the failure of stimulus to fix the problem, asserting that fiscal stimulus is per se ineffective.
There is a word for this: chutzpah.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Urges Campaigns to Discuss Immigration Reform

BYLINE: KAREN ANN CULLOTTA and JESS BIDGOOD


HIGHLIGHT: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg appeared with William M. Daley, a former White House chief of staff, in Chicago, and with media mogul Rupert Murdoch in Boston to promote proposals on immigration reform and urge a more vigorous discussion of the topic in the presidential campaign. 

 BODY:
9:50 p.m. | Updated BOSTON - Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg joined Rupert Murdoch, the chief of the News Corp. media company, in Boston on Tuesday night, appearing in the same city as Mitt Romney's campaign headquarters to make an economic argument for immigration reform and call for a more substantial discussion of the issue in the presidential campaign.
"I think we are in a crisis in this country," said Mr. Murdoch, the Australian-born media mogul who is himself a naturalized American. "Right now, if we get qualified people in, there shouldn't be any nonsense about it." 
The pair appeared at a forum co-hosted by the New England Council and moderated by Gerald Seib, an assistant managing editor for the Wall Street Journal. Mr. Bloomberg had appeared earlier in the day with former White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley at a forum on the same topic in Chicago. 
"One can argue very, very strongly that most immigrants add tremendously to the economy," said Mr. Murdoch on Tuesday night.
But the pair lamented how, despite what they see as an urgent need for immigration reform, a deeply divided Congress is unlikely to legislate any.
"Both sides have tried to hold the other hostage," said Mr. Bloomberg, adding, "I think there is a consensus, but I don't see how they come together."
Both saw a clear political advantage for the presidential candidates to push for immigration reform - especially on the Republican side, they said.
"As for the so-called illegal Mexicans, give them a path to citizenship. They pay taxes, they are hard-working people," said Mr. Murdoch, adding, "Why Mitt Romney doesn't do it, I have no idea, because they are natural Republicans."
"Republicans walking away from the Latino electorate is about as dumb a strategy as any political party has ever adopted," agreed Mr. Bloomberg.
The pair also offered their own policy prescriptions, calling for reforms that would increase access by both high- and low-skilled foreign workers to the American economy.
"We give out most of our visas for family reunification," said Mr. Bloomberg. "You look at a country like Canada, most of their visas are given out for helping the economy."
The two were harshly critical of the H1-B visa, a temporary visa for workers in certain specialized occupations, which Mr. Murdoch said limits the stateside options for some foreign born graduates of masters and Ph. D. programs in valuable specialties like science and engineering. "When they get a graduation certificate, if it's in a certain field, they should have a green card stapled to it," said Mr. Murdoch.
2:08 p.m. | Updated CHICAGO -- Mr. Bloomberg appeared with William M. Daley, a former White House chief of staff, for breakfast here on Tuesday, united in their belief that immigration reform is one of the best and cheapest ways to revive the nation's economy.
Speaking at a gathering of the Economic Club of Chicago, Mr. Bloomberg chided both President Obama and Mitt Romney for what Mr. Bloomberg perceives as a bipartisan reluctance to discuss immigration reform during an increasingly fractious campaign season.
"Neither candidate is talking about immigration reform," Mr. Bloomberg said. "But there is no way to help the economy as quickly and as cost-free as opening the borders to create jobs and create business."
"Around the world, people want to move to America, and they vote with their feet," Mr. Daley added. "The world wants to come here, and we need them to come here."
Indeed, according to a recent report by the Partnership for a New American Economy, a group of mayors and business leaders led by Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Murdoch, immigrants are more than twice as likely to start a business as the native-born, accounting for the start of 28 percent of new American businesses in 2011, despite representing just 12.9 percent of the population.
In recent years, Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly argued for the need for comprehensive immigration reform. And on Wednesday, a federal program announced by President Obama to defer deportations of some 1.7 million young illegal immigrants officially goes into effect.
The breakfast meeting in Chicago - home of Mr. Obama's campaign headquarters - was the first of two forums sponsored by the partnership. Mr. Murdoch was expected to join Mr. Bloomberg on Tuesday evening for a second immigration reform discussion in Boston, where Mr. Romney has his headquarters. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney spent more time in swing states on Tuesday, with Mr. Obama in Iowa and Mr. Romney in Ohio.
While the naming of Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin as Mr. Romney's running mate has accelerated demands that the candidates define their plans for reducing the federal budget deficit, Mr. Bloomberg urged Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney to share their ideas for immigration reform, despite its being an often polarizing issue with voters.
"There has got to be something more important than getting elected," Mr. Bloomberg said.

HEADLINE: Biden Warns Romney Policies Would Put Crowd 'Back in Chains'

BYLINE: REBECCA BERG


HIGHLIGHT: The vice president has some provocative words as his party tries to rally the black vote in Virginia. 

 BODY:
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. created a stir Tuesday at a campaign speech in Virginia when he told the crowd that Mitt Romney's policies would enable the banking and financial sectors to "put you all back in chains."
The remark came roughly two-thirds of the way through Mr. Biden's 30-minute speech, which was delivered to a crowd that included many African-Americans at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville, Va.
"Romney wants to let the - he said in the first hundred days, he's going to let the big banks once again write their own rules, unchain Wall Street," Mr. Biden said. "They're going to put you all back in chains."
On a C-Span video of the speech, the audience does not appear to react negatively to Mr. Biden's phrasing; indeed, laughter can be heard among the crowd.
President Obama and his surrogates have been campaigning heavily in Virginia, and the campaign's strategy relies in part on energizing the black vote to take the traditionally Republican state, which moved to the Democratic column in the 2008 presidential election. According to the Census, the population of Danville is roughly 48.8 percent white and 48.6 percent black. 
After Mr. Biden's address, some Republicans assailed Mr. Biden's remark. On Twitter, Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary for President George W. Bush, likened the comment to one made by Sarah Palin when she compared critical press coverage to "blood libel," a term alluding to the false allegation that Jews once killed Christian children to use their blood for religious rituals.
"The press pounded Palin when she talked about 'blood libel,'" Mr. Fleischer wrote. "What will they do about Biden's 'chains' remark?"
Later Tuesday, both presidential campaigns responded to the vice president's remarks, with Mr. Romney's campaign calling the phrasing "not acceptable."
"After weeks of slanderous and baseless accusations leveled against Governor Romney, the Obama campaign has reached a new low," Andrea Saul, Mr. Romney's press secretary, said in a statement. "The comments made by the vice president of the United States are not acceptable in our political discourse and demonstrate yet again that the Obama campaign will say and do anything to win this election. President Obama should tell the American people whether he agrees with Joe Biden's comments."
In a statement, Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama's deputy campaign manager, defended Mr. Biden.
"For months, Speaker Boehner, Congressman Ryan and other Republicans have called for the 'unshackling' of the private sector from regulations that protect Americans from risky financial deals and other reckless behavior that crashed our economy. Since then, the vice president has often used a similar metaphor to describe the need to 'unshackle' the middle class. Today's comments were a derivative of those remarks, describing the devastating impact letting Wall Street write its own rules again would have on middle class families. We find the Romney campaign's outrage over the vice president's comments today hypocritical, particularly in light of their own candidate's stump speech questioning the president's patriotism. Now, let's return to that 'substantive' debate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan promised 72 hours ago, but quickly abandoned."
As he concluded his speech, Mr. Biden confused North Carolina with Virginia, where Danville is located.
"With you we can win North Carolina again, and if we do, we win the election if we win you," Mr. Biden said. 
The city of Danville abuts the northern border of North Carolina, which also went for Mr. Obama in 2008 but is considered a more challenging state for his campaign this time around.
At a second appearance on Tuesday, in Wytheville, Va., Mr. Biden said his remarks had merely alluded to a term used previously by Republicans, including Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan. In his response to Mr. Obama's State of the Union address in 2011, Mr. Ryan said, "We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people, of every background, to succeed and prosper."
"And I'm told that when I made that comment earlier today in Danville, Va., the Romney campaign put out a tweet," Mr. Biden told the crowd in Wytheville. "You know, tweets these days? Put out a tweet, went on the airwaves saying, 'Biden, he's outrageous in saying that,' I think I said instead of 'unshackled,' 'unchained.' 'Outrageous to say that.' That's what we had. I'm using their own words."
"I got a message for them," Mr. Biden continued. "If you want to know what's outrageous, it's their policies and the effects of their policies on middle-class America. That's what's outrageous."
Mr. Romney addressed Mr. Biden's original remark in a speech Tuesday evening in Chillicothe, Ohio, calling it an indicator that Mr. Obama's presidency had become "angry and desperate," according to The Associated Press.

(Frugal Traveler)

PUB-DATE: August 14, 2012

SECTION: TRAVEL

LENGTH: 1244 words

HEADLINE: For Obama and Romney, a To-Do List for Travelers

BYLINE: SETH KUGEL


HIGHLIGHT: The Frugal Traveler dreams big, proposing presidential fixes for nine travel-related issues. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney and President Obama are pounding the campaign trail, courting swing voters by talking about so-called issues like "jobs," "the budget" and "health care." Anyone notice anything missing here? Like a nod toward the issues that matter to that all-important, nonpartisan voting bloc, the American budget traveler?
The candidates have a historic opportunity to impress us, the group that pollsters sometimes label "itinerant cheapskates." Some things are too obvious to merit a mention - of course, our airlines should receive government subsidies to offer free hard candies to passengers, keeping American companies competitive with foreign carriers that already do so, like Air Berlin and Brazil's TAM.
But here are the nine issues that top the official Frugal Traveler-endorsed platform. Mr. President, Mr. Romney? What say you?

No. 1 - Bring Parity to Tipping.
Navigating cultural differences overseas can make for fascinating moments: for example, figuring out whether proper greeting etiquette calls for a bow, handshake or a kiss on the cheek. But there is simply no upside to the stress of deducing where, when and how much to tip.
That is why our next president should convene a Treaty on Tipping International Protocol (ToTIP). A worldwide standard for tipping would help millions of travelers and easily ticked-off service workers alike.
Americans would benefit the most. Our own restaurant tipping system is far from logical: if service is good, you either tip 15 percent - embarrassing companions who think you should give 20 percent - or tip 20 percent, risking accusations of financial irresponsibility from those who tip 15 percent.
If a habitual 20-percent tipper is unhappy with the service, he tips 15 percent, getting no clear message across. A 15-percent tipper drops it to 10 percent; that tells the server the customer is probably either a European tourist or just bad at math.
Meanwhile, servers get paid sub-minimum wage and depend on bozos like you to figure out how much to tip.
Let's adopt the Scandinavian model, where diners generally don't tip at all and yet the servers all have reasonable salaries (and government-provided health care, but let's not go there). Or maybe the Brazilian model, where 10 percent is automatically added to the bill and can be removed by request if the service was terrible - unambiguously getting your point across.
No. 2 - More Metrics, More Jobs. 
It's a truism that when we travel abroad, we often learn more about our own country than the one we're visiting. Sometimes, it's the stuff we should be thankful for, like freedom of speech, building codes and real ketchup.
But sometimes, as is the case with our system of measurements, you realize we're on the losing side. For example, when you hear a forecast of temperatures in the mid-30s (Celsius, of course) and have no idea whether that's beach weather. (It is.) Or when asked how many kilograms you weigh - perhaps as you are being equipped for a bungee jump - you have to answer, "I don't know. Quite a few?"
It's been a long time since we tested whether women were witches by binding them hand and foot and seeing if they float, so I don't understand why we still use inches, ounces and Fahrenheit to measure things while the rest of the world mocks us.
But it sure does cause problems in travel, and the new president should get the country to adopt the metric system once and for all. Here's how to pitch it: "My fellow Americans, just think of all the jobs we could create with the demand for new scales, thermometers and highway signs."
No. 3 - Better Credit Cards for All.
American credit cards are so antiquated we might as well still be using floppy disks in our computers or playing Pacman on Atari. And their incompatibility with ticket machines in overseas train stations or aboard long-distance buses can send us scurrying for an A.T.M.
The nearly universal international standard for credit cards is the chip and PIN system, in which a computer chip and a personal identification number or PIN replaces our magnetic swipe and signature. But that is apparently either too expensive or technologically advanced for American banks to do.
This summer, I met Scandinavian merchants who did not even know that the little slot to the right of the credit card machine was for swiping; they had never done anything but stick the high-security chip halfway into the hole in the bottom. And I made sure to carry a modern pen to sign with, lest they thought Americans still used quills and ink bottles.
At least their machines could take a swipe - that's not true everywhere. It's time for government to intervene and force the banks' hands.
No. 4 - Bilateral Visa Initiatives.
The candidates may know Brazil, Russia, India and China as the BRIC countries, fast-developing economies with promising markets. Travelers know them as destinations that charge United States citizens more than others for the required tourist visa. (Other countries, like Bolivia and Tanzania, do too.)
These countries defend the differential by noting the high prices we charge their citizens to visit the United States; they call their policy "reciprocity," the diplomatic term for revenge.
It's not an altogether bad argument. The presidential candidates should propose to reduce the cost of an American travel visa, a move that would be an overall winner: those countries would end their reciprocity pricing, and we'd get an increased flow of free-spending foreigners to stimulate our economy.
The counterargument, I imagine, is that the State Department fees go to application-screening costs necessary to weed out those who might overstay their visas and become illegal immigrants.
But since this is an American presidential campaign, reasonable objections raised by our opponents are irrelevant. So forget I mentioned it.
No. 5 - We're All United Statesians.
I'll admit this one's a long shot, given the need for unapologetic patriotism on the campaign trail. But a constant irritant in travel to the Caribbean and Latin America arises when local residents ask us where we're from and we reply, "I'm American."
They respond, snidely and predictably, "I'm American, too." If I may be allowed to interpret, they are saying, "Stop appropriating our common continent as your nationality, you self-aggrandizing neo-imperialist."
What they don't realize is we're stuck. There's no other single word in English to specifically describe someone from the United States, though such words exist in the three other major languages in our hemisphere: the Spanish "estadounidense," the French Canadian "états-unien" and the Portuguese "estadunidense."
But hearing the "American" complaint too often can mar an otherwise happy vacation, and arguing with the complainers can only make things worse
Much as I'd like to see the president use his bully pulpit to coin a new word, I'm guessing this is a political nonstarter. So I would ask him to begin a covert operation, led jointly by the C.I.A. and the Department of Education, to introduce the words "United Statesian" into our nation's preschools. That would lead to a society completely at ease with the term in a generation or two. Three at most.
Nos. 6, 7, 8 and 9 - Fixing Everything Else.
If it's not too much of a bother, I'd also ask for smoother and more effective airport security, continued diplomatic and intelligence efforts to reduce risk of attacks on American travelers abroad, more vacation time for workers and more legroom on planes.

HEADLINE: Another Book From Bob Woodward

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
The fall books season just got a little more crowded. Bob Woodward's 17th book, "The Price of Politics,'' will be published on Sept. 11, his publisher said on Tuesday, in the splashy, embargoed style that has been a trademark of a Woodward release.The book is "an intimate, documented examination of how President Obama and the highest profile Republican and Democratic leaders in the United States Congress attempted to restore the American economy and improve the federal government's fiscal condition over three and one half years," the publisher, Simon & Schuster, said in a statement. 
An excerpt of the book will run in The Washington Post, where Mr. Woodward is an associate editor. Mr. Woodward is expected to grant interviews to Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos of ABC News.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Texas's Capital, Construction on Many Corners

BYLINE: By MATT HUDGINS

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- Amit Sudharshan, 28, dons shorts and flip flops to walk the two blocks from his downtown apartment here to his job as a quantitative researcher at RGM Advisors.The high-frequency trading company based here shares a floor of the Chase Bank Tower with the more conservatively dressed workers at the offices of United States Senator John Cornyn.
Mr. Sudharshan and his wife, Megan Guse Sudharshan, are among the wave of young residents who have embraced a fledgling urban lifestyle in Texas's capital, where Cirrus Logic recently constructed a new downtown headquarters and Facebook, Google and other high-tech employers have set up shop alongside the lobbyists, lawyers and professional service providers who have traditionally filled office space in the central business district.
The combination of a diversifying business center and Austin's renowned entertainment scene has recently drawn an influx of young and highly educated workers downtown. 
To meet their housing needs, about 500 apartments are under construction and several developers are poised to begin construction on other residential projects. But apartment buildings are not the full extent of this downtown resurgence. Several hotels are under construction, and there are plans for at least two substantial office towers and multiple mixed-use projects.
''What's happened in downtown over the past seven years is that the office space was here, the housing came, and retail is arriving last to the scene,'' said Mike Kennedy, president and chief executive of a local real estate firm, Commercial Texas.
Downtown residences are relatively new to Austin. Rental apartment construction started in the late 1990s, with residential condominium development following in the early 2000s. The recession curbed condo sales and is now ushering in this latest round of rental development.
The city's central business district has about 1,500 residential condominium units and 1,500 rental apartments, according to Capitol Market Research, a real estate consulting firm here. Downtown living has proved remarkably popular, with a rental occupancy rate of almost 97 percent, nearly equal to the citywide rate of 97.8 percent, according to Capitol Market Research.
''Living downtown is great,'' said Mr. Sudharshan. ''We've gone months without driving anywhere except to go to the airport.''
Landlords are raking in profits: The citywide average monthly apartment rental rate of $1.10 a square foot is the highest in the state, and downtown apartment rents are more than twice the city average, according to Charles H. Heimsath, president of Capitol Market Research.
''Downtown has developed such a charisma that people just really want to be downtown and are willing to pay, particularly young people in the 25-34 age group,'' Mr. Heimsath said.
Lenders are still cautious about condominiums, but have backed several hundred rental apartment units now under construction. Riverside Resources, a developer here, is midway through construction of Third and Brazos, a 277-unit apartment project just a block east of Congress Avenue, which runs north-south through the center of downtown.
Gables Residential is digging the foundation for Gables Park Plaza II, which is planned as a 222-unit, 18-story apartment building eight blocks west of Congress and overlooking Lady Bird Lake, a center of activity for runners and boaters.
Several other developers are prepared to begin multifamily construction in the heart of downtown, which is bound by the lake on its southern edge and the Capitol building to the north. Its general boundary on the east is Interstate 35 and on the west is MoPac Boulevard.
Hotel development is heating up as well. White Lodging Services, a corporation in Indiana, is building a 1,012-room JW Marriott convention hotel, scheduled to open in 2015. Closer to the Austin Convention Center, Manchester Texas Financial Group plans to break ground next year on a 1,000-room Fairmont Austin hotel. The 300-room Hyatt Place Hotel is under construction one block west of the convention center.
Annual events like the Austin City Limits music festival and South by Southwest, the popular music, film and interactive gathering, can bring 200,000 to 300,000 visitors to the metropolitan area at a time, far more than will fit in the city's 30,000 hotel rooms. The central business district has about 6,000 hotel rooms and desperately needs the more than 2,000 rooms now in the pipeline, said Steve Alberts, communications manager at the Austin Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''For a long time, there has been a strong demand for more hotel rooms,'' he said.
Hotel demand shows that downtown is a popular destination for visitors as well as residents, said a local economist, Angelos Angelou. ''Austin's downtown is unique in the sense that the nighttime population that visits downtown is larger probably than the number of people working downtown,'' said Mr. Angelou, the founder and chief executive of AngelouEconomics, an economic development and site-selection consulting firm.''
The West Sixth Street entertainment district has emerged organically in the last decade on the western edge of downtown, near the Whole Foods world headquarters and flagship store. Some bars and restaurants in this submarket generate $700 to $1,000 a square foot in annual sales, according to Nate Paul, president and chief executive at World Class Capital Group here.
''Those numbers are similar to what you see in some of the biggest markets in the nation,'' said Mr. Paul, whose company recently bought several Austin properties including the former Katz's Deli building at 618 West Sixth Street. ''Austin is the most desirable city in the fastest growing state in the nation,'' Mr. Paul said. ''Demand is outpacing supply for nearly every asset type downtown.''
Office buildings will soon join the party. Endeavor Real Estate Group, based here, plans to develop the 195,000-square-foot IBC Bank Plaza at 500 West Fifth Street. Cousins Properties, based in Atlanta, is planning a larger project, the 390,000-square-foot Third and Colorado, a few blocks away.
Both office buildings could begin construction this year, the developers say, and both are geared to a new type of tenant: high-tech employers. Tech workers are more likely to live downtown and require less space for parking. Office finishes tend to be bare floors and to have more collaboration space, shareable workstations and bright color palettes rather than the conservative oak and marble finishes and corner offices favored by law firms.
It's not surprising that Facebook chose 300 West Sixth Street for its 60,000-square-foot Austin office, said Mr. Kennedy, the real estate broker. Built in 2002, the building was a good fit for the first Facebook office outside the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif.
With occupancy at 88 percent in the highest quality office buildings, Mr. Kennedy said he believed Austin would lose high-tech employers to other markets if it didn't introduce more new downtown office buildings soon.
Robert Hess, an executive managing director in the consulting division of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, has seen Austin rise to prominence on many employers' lists of preferred cities for relocation and expansion over the last 25 years. The airport lacks frequent flights from major cities, he said, and the area's public schools could stand improvement. But the city offers great advantages to companies concerned with attracting top talent.
''Austin is an exciting city, a very dynamic, progressive city,'' Mr. Hess said. ''A lot of our clients right now are interested in urban developments, and they want to know, have these communities taken care of their downtowns? And Austin has.''

HEADLINE: Pulling Together Real Stracciatella

BYLINE: By JANE BLACK

 BODY:
PERHAPS love was in the air. I was on my honeymoon in Italy, after all. But when I took my first bite of just-made stracciatella, thin strands of fresh mozzarella soaked in heavy cream, I knew I had found another true love.That first day, last year, we ate it with juicy summer tomatoes. The next day, we smeared it on bread and topped it with fig preserves. One night before bed, I ate what was left in the container with a spoon.
Back home, though, the good stuff was hard to find, and I couldn't understand why. Fresh mozzarella is everywhere. So is burrata, a ball of fresh mozzarella stuffed with stracciatella. Even the imported product lacked the tang and richness I remembered.
Happily, that is changing, thanks in part to the cheesemakers Rynn and David Caputo. The Caputos, who are in their 30s, spent years perfecting their pasta filata, or stretched-curd cheeses, before opening Caputo Brothers Creamery in Spring Grove, Pa., in 2011. While it would have been easy to sell the familiar mozzarella and its fashionable and very profitable cousin, burrata, Ms. Caputo is on a quest to crown stracciatella the new ''it'' cheese: one that provides the wow factor of burrata, but is far easier (and less expensive) to make. 
''People need to eat this cheese,'' Ms. Caputo said. ''It just'' -- she paused, searching for words -- ''changes you.''
Ms. Caputo's own love affair with stracciatella began six years ago, when she was a newlywed herself. She was an information-technology manager; her husband was selling pharmaceuticals, but harbored dreams of becoming a chef.
With plans to open a restaurant, the couple quit their jobs and enrolled in an intensive culinary program in Calabria, the toe of the Italian boot. There, they learned to make pasta, salumi and, of course, southern Italy's famous stretched curd cheeses.
Stracciatella (pronounced strahtch-ah- TELL-ah), like so many peasant foods, was born as a clever way to use leftovers, in this case the odd bits that remain after mozzarella is stretched. Cheesemakers in Puglia, where the cheese originates, used the excess (and even mozzarella unsold the day before), stretching them into long ropes. They then tore those into thin strands and bathed them in cream. (The Italian verb stracciare means ''to tear apart,'' which is why the name is also used for the classic Roman soup with shreds of egg, and vanilla gelato laced with shavings of chocolate.) Stracciatella was served just like that, or stuffed inside new balls of mozzarella and called burrata.
For Ms. Caputo, all of these cheeses tasted better in Italy. And she soon discovered why. Traditional mozzarella is fermented with cultures, to turn the milk's lactose into lactic acid, a process that develops flavor. In contrast, much of the mozzarella made in the United States is treated with vinegar or citric acid to raise its acidity, making it easier to stretch. This is cheaper and faster than fermentation. It also has the added benefit of extending the cheese's shelf life for weeks, something American consumers expect.
''It's like taking grape juice and adding vinegar to it,'' Ms. Caputo said. ''That doesn't make it wine. Mozzarella, stracciatella and burrata are all supposed to taste like something. But in this country, we got used to them not tasting like anything at all.''
To make her cheese, Ms. Caputo starts with high-butterfat milk from local grass-fed cows. She ferments the milk for eight hours, before adding a coagulator, rennet. The curds are then stretched into cheese or frozen, which pauses the cheesemaking process so that chefs and home cooks can stretch their own and eat it as many Italians do, the same day it is stretched.
Ms. Caputo's pitch has been an easy sell. In New York, Murray's Cheese picked up the product three months after Caputo Brothers began; Saxelby Cheesemongers sells the curds in-store and online, and offers cheese-stretching demonstrations for customers.
Under Ms. Caputo's tutelage, some of New York's top kitchens have found that making stracciatella is easy and economical: After meeting with her last month, Matt Abdoo, the chef de cuisine of Del Posto, stopped importing burrata from Italy and now makes stracciatella to serve with his summer heirloom tomato salad. Telepan has replaced burrata with house-made stracciatella. And The Dutch is serving stracciatella with stone fruit and corn bread croutons.
''There is this tang in her cheese that is just like what you find in Italy,'' said Jonathan Benno, the executive chef at Lincoln, who is serving sweet corn agnolotti with stracciatella and summer truffles. ''The extra step of fermentation produces something that is very, very special.''
Making stracciatella at home takes about 15 minutes. Thaw the curds in the refrigerator overnight, then break them into small nickel- or dime-size pieces and season with kosher salt, about one tablespoon for each pound of curds. Next, heat water to 180 degrees in a pot or electric kettle and pour it over the curds until they are just covered. Using a wooden spoon, lift the curds and let them fall -- or stretch -- back into the water. After three to five minutes, when the curds are smooth, shiny and supple, they are ready to be shaped.
Holding the curds in one hand, let them fall into a long rope. Use the other hand to pull the curds apart into thin strands, and place them in a bowl or container of heavy cream. Good cream is important; Ms. Caputo recommends low-temperature pasteurized cream with at least 35 percent butterfat. Ultrapasteurized cream has a flat flavor and will smother the vibrant taste of the curds.
These days, I like to use stracciatella in any dish that calls for fresh mozzarella. The creaminess pairs beautifully with tomatoes. But it is as delicious with roasted peppers or grilled peaches and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. Stracciatella also melts like a dream: perfect for pizza or a standout cheeseburger.
Or you could just eat it right out of the container with a spoon.
Caputo Brothers stracciatella is $12.99 a pound at Murray's Cheese Shop, 254 Bleecker Street (between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue). Saxelby Cheesemongers sells it for $16.99 a pound at its shop in the Essex Street Market, 120 Essex Street (between Delancey and Rivington Streets), and $24.99 a pound, with shipping, at saxelbycheese.com.
Rynn Caputo will teach a class on ''Mozzarella and More,'' which includes stracciatella, at Murray's Cheese Shop on Aug. 23 from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. The cost is $100; murrayscheese.com/edu_classcalendar.asp.

HEADLINE: July Retail Sales Rose 0.8%, Well Beyond Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Retail sales rose in July for the first time in four months as demand increased for goods including cars and electronics, a sign that consumers could drive faster economic growth in the third quarter.The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that retail sales rose a better-than-expected 0.8 percent last month, the largest gain since February and well beyond analysts' expectations. 
A separate report from the Labor Department showed that producer prices increased 0.3 percent in July, the fastest pace in five months, even as energy prices fell.
The broad-based expansion in retail sales bolstered the view that the slowdown in economic growth in the second quarter would prove temporary.
''Here comes the U.S. consumer,'' said Harm Bandholz, an economist at UniCredit Group.
Consumer spending drives the American economy, but sluggish retail sales contributed to weak growth in the spring.
Economic signs have been more reassuring this summer. Hiring accelerated in July despite a slight increase in the unemployment rate to 8.3 percent.
The strength in retail sales in July raised questions about whether the Federal Reserve would pursue a third round of bond-buying, or quantitative easing, to stimulate growth.
''Today's retail sales data further reduces the likelihood of QE3 in September, but does not take it off the table,'' said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Bank of America in New York.
Fed policy makers will meet next on Sept. 12 and 13.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected retail sales to increase 0.3 percent.
Pointing to a strong gain in consumer spending in July, the so-called core measure of retail sales -- which excludes autos, gasoline and building materials -- rose 0.9 percent. That was the biggest gain since January.
Stronger consumer spending would help corporations that do business in the United States. Home Depot, the world's largest home improvement chain, reported a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street predictions on Tuesday and raised its earnings outlook for the fiscal year.
Economic growth in the United States cooled to a 1.5 percent annual rate in the second quarter from a 2 percent pace in the first quarter, and economists are now banking on an acceleration.
The Commerce Department also said that in June overall retail sales declined 0.7, more than first reported, which economists said should curb some enthusiasm over the increase in retail sales.
''Given that sales are only marginally higher since the start of the year, households clearly remain cautious,'' said Amna Asaf, an economist with Capital Economics in Toronto.
While the Labor Department's index of producer prices, which measures prices received by farms, factories and refineries, climbed 0.3 percent last month on higher costs for consumer goods and food, the gain was muted by a drop in energy prices.
Excluding food and energy costs, core inflation at the wholesale level accelerated 0.4 percent in July. The core measure has held at higher levels even as a sharp drop in energy prices over the last year has pulled overall producer prices lower.
''This report suggests core inflation will persist despite price swings in food and energy,'' said Cooper Howes, an economist at Barclays.

HEADLINE: Importing Russia's Top Gun

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
IZHEVSK, Russia -- The nickname of this town, home of the factory that makes Kalashnikov rifles, is the ''Armory of Russia.'' Over the years, it has armed a good number of other countries, too, as the lathes and presses of the Izhevsk Machine Works clanged around the clock to forge AK-47s and similar guns for insurgents and armies around the world.But these days, many of Izhevsk's weapons are headed somewhere else: the United States.
Despite the gun's violent history -- or perhaps because of it -- American hunters and gun enthusiasts are snapping up tens of thousands of Kalashnikov rifles and shotguns. Demand is so brisk that the factory has shifted its focus from military to civilian manufacture over the last two years. United States sales of the civilian versions, sold under the brand name Saiga, rose by 50 percent last year, according to officials at the factory, known as Izhmash. 
Over all, the United States is the world's biggest market for civilian guns. That is partly because of comparatively lenient gun ownership laws, which have become a topic of renewed debate after a rampage last month in which a masked gunman killed 12 people and wounded 58 in an Aurora, Colo., movie theater. Although no Kalashnikovs were involved, police say one weapon used by the man charged with the shootings, James Eagen Holmes, was a popular semiautomatic pistol made by the Austrian company Glock.
Russian weapons accounted for a tiny portion of the $4.3 billion American gun market last year, but Saiga sales rose far faster than the overall growth rate of 14 percent in 2011.
''I bought a Saiga because it was made in Russia, right beside its big brothers, the AKs,'' Josh Laura, a garage door installer and former Marine in Maryville, Tenn., said in a telephone interview. ''No rifle in the world has been as reliable as this one.''
Selling rifles to Americans and other civilians is fundamental to the efforts to save Izhmash, which has made Kalashnikovs since soon after their invention in 1947 but is now struggling.
Demand for new military guns in the Kalashnikov family has evaporated. Simple, durable and relatively cheap to manufacture, about 100 million have been produced over the decades, or about one for every 70 people on earth. Inventories are overflowing, used AK weapons have flooded the market, and cheap Chinese knockoffs are stealing many of the customers that remain.
For American gun enthusiasts, an authentic Russian-made Kalashnikov is appealing not only for its historical importance as the weapon of choice in so many global conflicts, but also because of its reliability.
''The quality and versatility far surpassed anything else on the market,'' said Terry Sandlin, an electrician in Scottsburg, Ind., who has three Saigas -- two shotguns and a rifle.
Although the civilian versions cannot fire bursts of bullets with a single trigger pull -- a military feature known as fully automatic mode -- it otherwise shares many features of military guns. Izhmash works with an importer who modifies weapons to add pistol grips or large-capacity magazines in states where those features are legal.
Maksim V. Kuzyuk, a board member of Izhmash and former chief executive, said that he studied the global market for small arms before deciding to focus on the United States.
''Typically, an American family will have five or six short- and long-barreled guns,'' Mr. Kuzyuk, a former director of the Boston Consulting Group in Moscow, said in an interview. ''Some collectors have more than 20 guns.''
And in the United States, Izhmash cannot be underpriced by Chinese competitors. The federal government has banned most imports of Chinese handguns and rifles since 1994.
Selling Saigas in the United States is integral to the enterprise's evolving business model of making single-shot civilian guns to occupy workers and equipment in between government orders for fully automatic assault rifles. About 70 percent of the factory's output is now civilian rifles, up from 50 percent two years ago. Of the civilian arms, about 40 percent are exported to the United States.
That means American consumers are now buying about the same number of Kalashnikov-style weapons from Izhmash as the Russian army and police.
This shift has been encouraged by the Kremlin, which wants to revive a range of military industries by improving their economies of scale and helping them blend military and civilian manufacturing.
Russian Technologies, a state holding company of which Izhmash is a part, is pursuing this policy across a range of industries, from aviation to truck manufacturing. The goal is to improve efficiency as Russia begins a $613 billion rearmament program, financed by oil money.
It was with this mandate, Mr. Kuzyuk said, that he came to Izhmash as chief executive in 2010 after working for another Russian Technologies enterprise, Avtovaz, the maker of Lada cars. (In May, he moved to yet another company in the group that makes helicopter parts.)
At Izhmash, as with other Russian military plants, he said, ''the basic problem was the volume of production was significantly lower than what the factory had been designed for'' -- essentially a land war between superpowers.
Although AK pattern rifles are used every day in global conflicts, very few are bought from Izhmash because of the ready availability of used guns as well as licensed and bootleg copies. The Russian army isn't planning many new orders until the AK-12, a new model to be introduced this year, is widely available.
The sales of civilian rifles in the United States are helping to pay for the factory's retooling for the AK-12, ultimately making it cheaper for the Kremlin.
Owen Martin, owner of Snake Hound Machine, a gunsmith in Manchester, N.H., that specializes in Kalashnikov rifles, said that, by the same token, Russian military orders were helping keep down the price of AKs he and others buy in the United States. ''It means our guns are cheaper,'' he said. ''Nobody perceives it as unpatriotic.''
American gun sales rose sharply in 2009, after President Obama's election and the onset of economic recession. Sales of semiautomatic rifles, in particular, benefited from customer concern that Mr. Obama would seek to more tightly regulate rifles with features resembling military weapons, according to Lawrence Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation.
Izhmash benefits from American gun laws that are looser than in its home market. In Russia, consumers can buy a long-barreled firearm only with a police permit, which requires a clean criminal sheet, a diploma from a gun safety course and a medical certificate of sanity. In the United States, laws vary by state, but buyers often need to clear only an F.B.I. criminal background check.
However, gun control in Russia is less strict than in some other former Soviet countries. Estonia, for example, proscribes carrying a weapon while drunk. ''If they did that here, well, nobody would hunt,'' said Igor V. Anisimov, the Izhmash director of foreign sales.

HEADLINE: Uncertainty Surrounds Next Year's Ironman

BYLINE: By FREDERICK DREIER

 BODY:
New York City's first Ironman may be its last.Two days after Saturday's inaugural Ironman United States Championship -- which was overshadowed by a water-contamination scare and the death of a participant -- race officials suspended registration for the 2013 event. Citing complex logistics and a sizable increase in participation fees, Shane Facteau, the vice president for North American operations for Ironman, said the company was debating whether to terminate the race. 
''At this point, nothing is off the table,'' Facteau said. ''We're going to look at this event and make sure we can give value to the customer and not at an exorbitant price point.''
Facteau said the company would give refunds to registrants for the 2013 race, which involves a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride and a 26.2-mile run, but would hold their spots should the event go off. Facteau said a decision would be reached in four to six weeks.
Registration for the 2013 New York City race opened Sunday at 8 a.m. Athletes who logged onto the race's registration Web site saw that the fee had jumped to $1,200 from $895 this year. Race officials declined to say how many participants registered for 2013, but Facteau confirmed the event did not sell out. When Ironman announced the New York City race in 2011, all 2,500 spots sold out online in 11 minutes.
The Brooklyn triathlete Travis You, 29, said the price increase did not sit well with him; however, he still paid the $1,200.
He said he had expected the registration fee ''to be in the same ballpark as this year. I figured $1,200 is still cheaper than buying an airline ticket and a hotel to travel to a race.''
Standard registration fees for Ironman races in the United States range from $500 to $700.
Facteau said the organization had other issues to weigh beyond the fee increase. New York City's ordinance against amplified noise after 10 p.m. meant slower participants finished in relative silence. Saturday's hot and humid weather also was a common complaint among participants.
Should it disappear, the New York City race would be the highest-profile Ironman to fold. In 2002, the organization called off its Ironman in Provo, Utah, after a swimmer drowned during the swim. That race was held in whipping wind that caused rough water conditions. Facteau said the death of a swimmer Saturday did not cause the suspension of registration. Race officials would not confirm the participant's name, but multiple news reports Monday identified him as the senior police officer Andy Naylor, 43, of the Hong Kong Criminal Intelligence Bureau.
John Korff, the local event director for the New York City Ironman race, said economics would ultimately decide the race's fate. Korff would not divulge the race's expenses, but he said the cost of renting seven ferries, building a swimming platform and closing down the Palisades Parkway easily made the event the Ironman's most cost-prohibitive race.
''We dreamed big, and I think we did as good a job as you could do in this complex market,'' Korff said. ''But just because everybody thinks it's awesome doesn't mean you can do it again.''

HEADLINE: Spanish Construction Rivals Battle on New York Turf

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
The dripping canyons of New York City's ever expanding network of train and subway tunnels would seem to be a far cry from the euro zone's continuing financial debacle.Yet for two ambitious Spanish construction conglomerates, underground Manhattan has emerged as the battleground in a furious legal dispute over which company will bear the brunt of losses plentiful enough to raise questions about the management of one of New York's biggest public works projects ever -- and the capacity of one of Spain's most indebted public companies to stomach them.
At the center of the dispute is Actividades de Construcción y Servicios, known as ACS, one of the largest construction companies in the world, which has pushed hard in recent years to win business outside its recession-bound home market.
Such efforts have made ACS, through its main construction arm Dragados, one of the more active contractors working on the $8.25 billion plan to bring the Long Island Rail Road to the East Side of Manhattan, just below Grand Central Terminal. 
Now, Dragados's joint venture partner, Judlau Contracting, which is 51 percent owned by OHL, a rival to ACS in Spain, is contending that Dragados's slice of the job -- hollowing out tunnels to link Long Island trains to Grand Central -- has been acutely mismanaged, resulting in a loss of as much as $250 million for the joint venture.
Amid a flurry of legal claims and counterclaims, Judlau has accused Dragados of failing to report its losses in a timely manner. Dragados in turn is suing Judlau, claiming that it did not fulfill its financial obligations to the joint venture.
The priority of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is that the East Side project -- already delayed years -- must be finished by 2019.
So even the largest of losses incurred by its contractors need not be a primary concern.
''Any dispute between the joint venture partners is immaterial to us as long as the work gets done well, on budget and on schedule -- which is exactly what has happened,'' said Adam Lisberg, a spokesman for the authority, which oversees the investment program.
How a Spanish construction company immersed itself in the world of big-ticket New York City public works projects -- where federal sting operations and payroll padding scandals can be as common as the heavy machinery used to bore tunnels under Manhattan's sidewalks -- carries the whiff of an episode of ''The Sopranos.''
But the consequences are far from fictitious. While ACS's 28 billion euros, or $34.4 billion, in sales and a diversified portfolio of global businesses make for a substantial buffer, problems in one of its crucial markets -- the United States, and New York in particular -- may ignite concerns about the capacity of the company's international operations to keep compensating for persistent problems in its home market.
Juan José Diaz Clavel, a spokesman for ACS, said the company does not comment on the finances of its projects. He also said that ''profitability data are always disclosed by ACS in the group's consolidated accounts'' and that ''one-off results in single projects are not the best indicator for operating performance.'' Last year, ACS earned 962 million euros, or $1.17 billion, compared with 1.3 billion euros the year before.
ACS officials also note that losses on certain projects are not unusual and are balanced by profits among its many other construction jobs worldwide.
A spokesman for Judlau declined to comment.
ACS, which gets 50 percent of its revenue from outside Spain, has been at the forefront of a push lasting decades by large Spanish companies to reap larger profits overseas. These companies, including the telephone operator Telefónica and the construction conglomerate Ferrovial, have used debt-fueled buying sprees to build significant international operations that have insulated them from domestic economic maladies.
But expansion has come at a cost. Spain has one of the highest levels of corporate debt in the world -- and as the global slowdown gets worse, the once-robust overseas businesses of these companies are beginning to feel the pinch, increasing pressure on the European and Spanish banks that financed these expansions.
More than half of ACS's 10 billion euros in debt -- an amount that is three times the size of the company's shrinking market value -- is linked to this diversification effort.
Under pressure from its bankers, ACS has pledged to sell noncore assets, but investor concerns about its debt and its exposure to the devastated real estate market in Spain have pushed the stock down more than 30 percent this year.
Driving the overseas push has been Dragados USA, which last year recorded $2.4 billion in sales, 41 percent of the company's international total.
New York is one of ACS's most important markets, accounting for 8 percent of Dragados's international construction business. Other New York City projects include the 72nd Street station for the new Second Avenue subway and the extension of the No. 7 subway line.
In late 2007, Dragados paid $150 million for the Schiavone Construction Company, a closely held builder based in Secaucus, N.J., with a longstanding expertise in tunnels and other heavy construction. Its aim was direct: to get in on the public works boom in New York City.
In some respects, the company got more than it bargained for.
Just three months later, a top Schiavone official working on the project was arrested on racketeering charges as part of a federal investigation into organized crime activities in the construction industry. The charges were later dropped.
In December 2010, Schiavone paid $20 million in fines to settle accusations that it had defrauded government-backed minority hiring programs. And this year, Dragados was forced to remove James Roemer, a senior project manager with oversight of payroll on the East Side job -- a critical position given that labor costs account for 80 percent of the $1.1 billion operation -- when it was disclosed that Mr. Roemer had served time in prison for fraud and tax evasion after inflating the payroll of an M.T.A. project in 2003. The activities leading to the first two cases occurred before Dragados bought the company. As for Mr. Roemer, Dragados has said it was unaware of the circumstances of his imprisonment when he was hired in 2009 to do more or less the same job in which he had committed his earlier crimes.
On the East Side project, the original joint-venture agreement between Dragados and Judlau envisioned a $200 million profit, to be split 60-40 in Dragados's favor. But as losses mounted, Judlau stopped financing its end of the venture, forcing its partner to pay millions to keep the project going and prompting it to sue Judlau. In a counterclaim, Judlau contends that Dragados has mismanaged the project by putting people like Mr. Roemer in charge of payroll, allowing costs to spiral out of control.
At its root, the spat reflects the clash between ACS and OHL for lucrative New York City business. ACS, with its larger market share, has more reason to accept short-term pain in exchange for long-term gain, construction specialists say. OHL and Judlau, it is thought, have no such inclination.
Judlau and OHL contend that the project losses are about $250 million for 2011. Reflecting its 40 percent share in the join venture, Judlau in its audited financial results for 2011 reported a loss of $103 million. With Dragados having a 60 percent share, that would suggest that its loss would be about $150 million.
Whether such a loss would have an immediate effect on the parent company's bottom line is debatable. Speaking broadly, ACS officials say that their risk and auditing functions are sound and that one project's loss need not have an immediate effect on the parent company's bottom line.
But with these profits under pressure, every penny counts. And people involved in the legal discussions say that Dragados officials have talked about drawing out the losses to reduce the effect in Madrid.
Barring a last-minute settlement, the two sides expect to argue their positions before a panel of arbitrators in the fall. And while the action at the hearing may end up being less than cinematic, the outcome will be closely watched -- in Spain as well as New York City.

Paula Shaw-Leary had every reason to believe that the seven children she raised in Harlem were finally clear of the street violence that had worried her for years.Her youngest son, Matt Shaw, 21, graduated from college in May and was heading to graduate school, following in the footsteps of his older siblings, who already had degrees or marriages that had mostly whisked them away from the persistent shootings in their neighborhood.
But a few hours after the fireworks of July 4, Matt Shaw was fatally shot two blocks from his mother's home. He was standing with a group of friends in front of the A.K. Houses when another young man fired into the crowd, hitting no one, then chased Mr. Shaw along Lexington Avenue and shot him in the back. 
On Tuesday, instead of helping her youngest son shop for school supplies, Ms. Shaw-Leary, 60, was sitting in State Supreme Court in Manhattan watching the arraignment of the man charged with killing him.
''I just miss him so, so, so much, every day,'' Ms. Shaw-Leary said through tears outside the courtroom, surrounded by some of her other children.
Ms. Shaw-Leary said prosecutors had told her they believed her son was killed in a case of mistaken identity.
Khalid Rahman, 20, pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges on Tuesday. He has been held without bail on Rikers Island since his arrest on July 13 and faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted.
''This young man had a bright future ahead of him,'' Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said in a statement. ''Instead, he will be remembered as a tragic victim.''
Harlem has been particularly struck by gun violence. The corner where Mr. Shaw was hanging out with friends, at East 128th Street and Lexington Avenue, is the same corner where a 17-year-old girl, Cheyenne Baez, was killed by a stray bullet two years ago.
In May, Mr. Shaw graduated from Le Moyne College, in Syracuse, and was looking forward to pursuing a master's degree in economics this fall at the State University of New York at Albany, Ms. Shaw-Leary said.
His mother, always worried about the guns on the streets, urged him to spend the summer with his sister in Atlanta. But as the Fourth of July holiday approached, Matt grew bored at his sister's house and came home.
''I just don't like New York in the summer for children,'' Ms. Shaw-Leary said. ''They have nothing to do, and everybody has a gun.''
Ms. Shaw-Leary, who works in customer service for Marriott Hotels, said she had made a practice of asking her children what they were carrying in their pockets when they left their apartment, grilling them about where they were headed and enforcing a curfew even in their adult years.
She described all of her children -- three other sons and three daughters, the oldest of whom are twin 40-year-olds -- as ambitious. One is studying fashion; another, culinary arts. One is a fashion photographer; another has a degree in social work.
''You can't move out of my house until you have a degree, until you are fully prepared for the world,'' she said. ''You can't even get married until you are fully prepared for the world.''
She described Matt as kind and generous. She was working a night shift on July 4 and called him at her apartment just before midnight. He told her he might go back outside.
''I told him to be safe,'' she said, choking back a tear.
She said she hoped that more people and politicians from African-American neighborhoods would join leaders like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly in their efforts to get guns off the streets.
''Our kids are black and they're the ones killing each other,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Giant Hospital Chain Is Blazing a Profit Trail

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and REED ABELSON; Griff Palmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
During the Great Recession, when many hospitals across the country were nearly brought to their knees by growing numbers of uninsured patients, one hospital system not only survived -- it thrived.In fact, profits at the health care industry giant HCA, which controls 163 hospitals from New Hampshire to California, have soared, far outpacing those of most of its competitors.
The big winners have been three private equity firms -- including Bain Capital, co-founded by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate -- that bought HCA in late 2006.
HCA's robust profit growth has raised the value of the firms' holdings to nearly three and a half times their initial investment in the $33 billion deal. 
The financial performance has been so impressive that HCA has become a model for the industry. Its success inspired 35 buyouts of hospitals or chains of facilities in the last two and a half years by private equity firms eager to repeat that windfall.
HCA's emergence as a powerful leader in the hospital industry is all the more remarkable because only a decade ago the company was badly shaken by a wide-ranging Medicare fraud investigation that it eventually settled for more than $1.7 billion.
Among the secrets to HCA's success: It figured out how to get more revenue from private insurance companies, patients and Medicare by billing much more aggressively for its services than ever before; it found ways to reduce emergency room overcrowding and expenses; and it experimented with new ways to reduce the cost of its medical staff, a move that sometimes led to conflicts with doctors and nurses over concerns about patient care.
In late 2008, for instance, HCA changed the billing codes it assigned to sick and injured patients who came into the emergency rooms. Almost overnight, the numbers of patients who HCA said needed more care, which would be paid for at significantly higher levels by Medicare, surged.
HCA, which had lagged the industry for those high-paying categories, jumped ahead of its competitors and was reimbursed accordingly. The change, which HCA's executives said better reflected the service being provided, increased operating earnings by nearly $100 million in the first quarter of 2009.
To some, HCA successfully pushed the envelope in its interpretation of existing Medicare rules. ''If HCA can do it, why can't we?'' asked a hospital consulting firm, the Advisory Board Company, in a presentation to its clients.
In one instance, HCA executives said a private insurer, which it declined to name, questioned the new billing system, forcing it to return some of the money it had collected.
The hospital giant also adopted a policy meant to address an issue that bedevils hospitals nationwide -- reducing costs and overcrowding in its emergency rooms. For years, the hospital emergency room has been used by the uninsured as a de facto doctor's office -- a place for even the most minor of ailments. But emergency care is expensive and has become increasingly burdensome to hospitals in the last decade because of the rising number of uninsured patients.
HCA decided not to treat patients who came in with nonurgent conditions, like a cold or the flu or even a sprained wrist, unless those patients paid in advance. In a recent statement, HCA said that of the six million patients treated in its emergency rooms last year, 80,000, or about 1.3 percent, '' chose to seek alternative care options.''
''Many E.R.'s in America, particularly in densely populated urban areas where most HCA-affiliated facilities are located, have adopted a variety of systems to determine whether a patient in fact needs emergency care,'' the statement said. ''About half our hospitals have done so. Typically, our affiliated hospitals have two caregivers -- usually a triage nurse and a physician -- make that determination. It should be noted that other non-HCA affiliated hospitals are using similar processes to address E.R. issues.''
As HCA's profits and influence grew, strains arose with doctors and nurses over whether the chain's pursuit of profit may have, at times, come at the expense of patient care.
HCA had put in place a flexible staffing system that allowed it to estimate the number of patients it would have each day in its hospitals and alter the number of nurses it needed accordingly.
Several nurses interviewed said they were concerned that the system sometimes had led to inadequate staffing in important areas like critical care. In one measure of adequate staffing -- the prevalence of bedsores in patients bedridden for long periods of time -- HCA clearly struggled. Some of its hospitals fended off lawsuits over the problem in recent years, and were admonished by regulators over staffing issues more than once.
'Through the Roof'
Many doctors interviewed at various HCA facilities said they had felt increased pressure to focus on profits under the private equity ownership. ''Their profits are going through the roof, but, unfortunately, it's occurring at the expense of patients,'' said Dr. Abraham Awwad, a kidney specialist in St. Petersburg, Fla., whose complaints over the safety of the dialysis programs at two HCA-owned hospitals prompted state investigations.
One facility was fined $8,000 in 2008 and $14,000 last year for delaying the start of dialysis in patients, not administering physician-prescribed drugs and not documenting whether ordered tests had been performed.
Claiming he provided poor care, the other hospital did not renew Dr. Awwad's privileges. Dr. Awwad is suing to have them reinstated. HCA declined to comment. HCA says it stands by its procedures, billing practices and level of care.
HCA says that more than 80 percent of its hospitals ranked among the top 10 percent in the country for federal quality measures, compared with 13 percent in 2006 when it went private. Last year, the company provided a $2.68 billion provision for charity care. And under the control of its private equity owners, HCA has invested around $8 billion in its hospitals in the last five years, according to Securities and Exchange Commission findings.
''You must know that we firmly believe that there is no sustainable business model as a health care delivery system that does not have at its core the provision of high-quality patient care and services,'' HCA's chief executive, Richard M. Bracken, wrote in an e-mail to The New York Times last year. Achieving a balance between profit and care is harder for investor-owned hospitals like HCA than for others, some experts say. ''If you were a for-profit hospital with investors and shareholders,'' said Paul Levy, a former nonprofit hospital executive in Boston unaffiliated with HCA, ''there would be a natural tendency to be more aggressive and to seek more revenues.'' Executives at profit-making hospitals are ''judged in greater measure by profitability'' than the administrators of nonprofit hospitals, he said.
Profit-making systems like HCA are often in a better position to invest in improving their hospitals and taking advantage of the latest in new technology. Their sheer size often allows them to negotiate lower prices for everything from X-ray machines to pharmaceuticals, which can, in theory at least, be passed onto consumers.
But some of HCA's tactics are now under scrutiny by the Justice Department. Last week, HCA disclosed that the United States attorney's office in Miami has requested information about cardiac procedures at 10 of its hospitals in Florida and elsewhere.
HCA's cardiac business is extremely lucrative, and the Justice Department has requested reviews that HCA conducted that indicate some of the heart procedures at some of its hospitals might not have been necessary and resulted in unjustified reimbursements from Medicare and other insurers.
To analyze HCA's business model, The Times examined federal and state hospital records, lawsuits and regulatory investigations, and interviewed dozens of current and former doctors, nurses and administrators. It also carried out an extensive data analysis based on statistics from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration and the American Hospital Directory, a private company that processes and resells federal health care data.
The story of HCA's growth offers a window on the changing world of health care. Small and nonprofit hospitals are closing or being gobbled up by medical conglomerates, many of which operate for a profit and therefore try to increase revenue and reduce costs even as they improve patient care. The trend toward consolidation is likely to accelerate under the Obama administration's health care law as hospitals grapple with what are expected to be lower reimbursements from the federal and state governments and private insurers.
HCA has a dynamic history and powerful political ties. It was co-founded in 1968 by members of the Tennessee family of Dr. Thomas Frist Sr., the father of the former Republican senator, William Frist, also a doctor.
Its boom years were in the mid-1990s when the hospital system, then called HCA-Hospital Corporation of America, merged with the Columbia Healthcare Corporation, a hospital group led by Rick Scott, now governor of Florida.
Columbia/HCA became the target of a widespread fraud investigation in the late 1990s, which led to one of the largest Medicare settlements ever. Mr. Scott was removed as chief executive by the board, but was never accused by regulators of wrongdoing.
After years of rebuilding, HCA's earnings began to weaken in early 2006 as admissions for operations at its hospitals tumbled, according to documents filed with the S.E.C. The weaker earnings in turn drove down the stock of the publicly traded company.
That spring, a group of investment bankers from Merrill Lynch approached top HCA executives to discuss a buyout by private equity firms.
The Merrill bankers found a receptive audience. Thomas F. Frist Jr., a board member, co-founder and brother of Senator Frist, had been a longtime investor in Bain Capital's buyout funds and contacted the firm to gauge its interest in acquiring HCA through a leveraged buyout and taking it private again, according to S.E.C. documents. A leveraged buyout is an acquisition of a company that is done with large amounts of borrowed money.
Other executives contacted Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, and the Merrill bankers brought the firm's own private equity team to invest in the deal, according to S.E.C. documents.
That July, HCA said it was being acquired in a deal valued at $33 billion.
The buyout came with risks. The new owners, who now occupied the majority of seats on HCA's board, contributed only about $1.2 billion apiece in equity outlay from funds they oversaw, borrowing around $16 billion and assuming $11.7 billion of HCA's outstanding debt. The deal essentially doubled the amount of debt held by HCA hospitals to $26 billion by borrowing from banks and selling bonds.
The Frist family also invested, as did other Wall Street banks. Among the new owners were top managers, including Jack O. Bovender Jr., then HCA's chief, and its president, Mr. Bracken, who became chief executive in January 2009.
In 2010, buoyed by robust growth in profit, HCA was able to issue billions of dollars in debt that was used to pay funds overseen by the three buyout firms nearly $1 billion in dividends -- each. In the spring of 2011, in one of the most closely watched public offerings since the financial crisis, HCA became a public company once again. Its three buyout owners each sold another $500 million worth of stock, allowing them to recoup all their initial investment.
Last fall, HCA agreed to buy back the stake held by Bank of America, which had purchased Merrill Lynch in 2009, for $1.5 billion, giving the bank a return of two and a half times its initial investment. And earlier this year, HCA paid out $900 million in dividends, of which $360 million went to K.K.R. and Bain.
The 40 percent stake in HCA still held by K.K.R. and Bain is worth about $4.8 billion at current levels, giving them a potential profit, with the dividends they have received, of three and a half times their initial investment of $1.2 billion each.
Those returns caught the attention of other buyout firms. In 2010, Steward Health Care System, controlled by Cerberus Capital Management and based in Boston, bought the second-largest hospital group in Massachusetts, converting it to a profit-making system. That same year, Vanguard Health Systems, which is run for profit and still has Blackstone Group as its largest shareholder after going public in 2011, bought eight hospitals in Detroit.
HCA itself continues to grow, buying up hospitals and doctor groups across the country. Large hospitals ''will be best positioned to deal with forthcoming changes. Size and scale definitely provides an advantage in terms of lowering our cost structure and sharing best practices,'' said HCA's chief executive, Mr. Bracken. All of which, he added, were ''essential ingredients for success.''
Redefining Emergency Care
Several years ago, digital billboards began popping up along highways throughout Florida, featuring the image of a painter falling from a ladder and the message, ''Accidents happen fast. Emergency care should too.'' Like highway signs that list the travel times to various destinations, the billboards flashed in real time the emergency room wait times -- 17 minutes, for example, or 45 minutes -- at nearby HCA hospitals.
HCA wanted to attract more patients to its emergency rooms, and it did. Annual visits climbed 20 percent from 2007 to 2011.
But while emergency departments are often a critical source of patient admissions, they are frequently money-losers because many patients do not have insurance. HCA found a solution: it figured out how to be paid more for the patients it was seeing.
All hospitals use a system of codes to bill services to Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers. The codes, which require some subjective evaluation, are supposed to reflect how much care is being delivered. Hospitals can differ over which treatments require which codes. A patient who walks into the emergency room with a simple case of indigestion would be classified by the hospital as using very little of its resources. The hospital would be reimbursed just $50 by Medicare for its evaluation.
A patient who might be suffering a heart attack might require oxygen, be placed on a cardiac monitor and transported for a CT scan. The hospital would classify those services at the highest level, earning it a $323 reimbursement from Medicare.
At HCA in 2006, slightly more than a quarter of the payments it received from Medicare were for patients classified in the two highest-paying categories, far behind the 58 percent reported at other hospitals, according to an analysis of Medicare payments by The Times, using data provided by the American Hospital Directory.
During that time, HCA was still operating under a corporate integrity agreement resulting from its Medicare fraud settlement, and an independent reviewer was scrutinizing its billing.
By late 2008, however, just as the agreement with federal regulators was ending, HCA introduced a new coding system for its emergency rooms. HCA said the system, based on a method developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians, was less complicated and better captured the time and resources used by the hospital.
Nearly overnight, HCA's patients appeared to be much, much sicker. By 2010, HCA had surpassed other hospitals, with 76 percent of its payments coming from the two most expensive classifications, versus 74 percent for other hospitals.
For individual HCA hospitals, the change made a big difference. At Riverside Community Hospital in California, Medicare reimbursements for the highest classifications surged to $949,000 in 2010, from $48,000 in 2006. Likewise, at Kendall Regional Medical Center in Miami, Medicare payments jumped to $1.5 million from $69,000. In a conference call in early 2009 with Wall Street analysts, HCA's executives said that the change in the billing system had increased the company's adjusted earnings by about 7 percent, or $75 million to $100 million, in a single quarter.
Behind the scenes, however, HCA executives said they realized the new system was causing too many of its patients to land in the highest-paying categories. HCA's head of ethics and compliance, Alan R. Yuspeh, said in a telephone interview last year that the company had identified the problem shortly after introducing the system and changed it to bring the company in line with the national average.
Still, HCA reported similar results in the next quarter.
Medicare has not provided hospitals with clear guidance about what kind of coding system they should use, and Mr. Yuspeh said HCA had alerted the agency to its use of the new system. No one has accused HCA of up-coding, or billing for more expensive services that were not needed -- one of the complaints made against it a decade ago.
Vicki Bryan at the research firm GimmeCredit began warning HCA's bondholders who subscribe to her reports in the spring of 2009 that HCA's model was bolstering short-term returns, but that the system could have potentially negative long-term consequences if Medicare balked and demanded reimbursements.
So far there is no indication Medicare has done so, and a spokeswoman declined to comment. The acting head of Medicare is Marilyn B. Tavenner, a former HCA executive who left there in 2005 to become the secretary of Health and Human Resources in Virginia.
Turning Away Patients
Changing billing codes wasn't the only avenue HCA pursued in search of higher profits.
Like many hospitals, HCA said its emergency rooms were overcrowded with patients who had minor illnesses like the flu rather than emergencies that it was obligated under federal law to treat. The company was among the first hospital systems to impose a protocol to reduce the number of patients it treated who did not seem to have a true medical emergency and were either unwilling or unable to pay.
Patients whose ailments were not deemed urgent were told to go somewhere else, like a free clinic, or that they could be treated if they paid the co-payment for their insurance or around $150 in cash.
Several former emergency department doctors at Lawnwood Regional Medical Center in Fort Pierce, Fla., said they frequently had felt compelled to override the screening system in order to treat patients.
One doctor, who asked not to be identified because he still works as an emergency physician, recalled one episode in which he was told to turn away a young boy with a deep cut in his arm because it was not bleeding profusely and he therefore did not meet the criteria.
''Physicians had a really, really hard time with it,'' said Dr. J. Patrick Pearsall, who worked for an emergency physician group based in Houston that worked in HCA hospitals. When the doctors failed to meet the hospital's goals for how many patients should be considered emergencies, ''they really started putting pressure on.''
One emergency room doctor who worked at an HCA Florida hospital said doctors had been told they had targets to hit. The doctors' concerns about the screening policy were acknowledged in an e-mail reviewed by The Times that was sent to the doctors at the hospital in early 2008 by an outside company that worked in the emergency room.
The doctors were told HCA's regional executives were ''quite intent on pursuing this program at least for the time being and fully expects us to comply. Their expectations are that approximately 15 percent of all patients are to be screened and of those screened no more than 35 percent overridden.''
Regulators in several states have taken HCA hospitals to task over screening out patients too aggressively, including situations where the screening missed serious conditions.
In early 2010, an uninsured patient who entered HCA's TriStar Skyline Medical Center in Nashville, complaining of ''pain when breathing,'' was sent away. An hour and a half later, at another hospital, the same patient was found to have pneumonia, according to the results of a Medicare investigation. Regulators cited Skyline for having ''failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was conducted.''
This year, the Office of Inspector General fined HCA's Northside Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla., $38,000 for sending home a feverish patient with an artificial heart valve. Two days later, the patient reappeared with the flu and severe respiratory problems. The following day, he died.
HCA officials say they instituted the screening system to reduce overcrowding in emergency rooms. The company said its hospitals were providing quality care to patients and attended to any patients with medical emergencies, fulfilling their obligations under federal law. ''Our E.R.'s are designed to offer access to everyone who needs emergency care,'' the company said in a statement this year. And HCA says it never instituted quotas.
Still, some executives at other hospitals say HCA's screening process is troubling. ''From a business perspective, if you're in Nashville, you're high-fiving each other,'' said John Couris, chief executive of Jupiter Medical, a rival Florida hospital. ''But from a public policy perspective, it's the wrong thing to do.''
Bedsores are ugly, painful wounds that can easily become infected and lead to dangerous complications for patients in hospitals.
Bedsores are also fairly easy to prevent. If nurses check patients regularly and turn them or, in certain cases, put patients on air mattresses that redistribute pressure, many bedsores can be prevented or treated early.
A Matter of Staff Levels
Experts say there is often a direct correlation between bedsores and the quality of hospital staff levels. ''Staffing is critical,'' said Courtney H. Lyder, the dean at the UCLA School of Nursing and an expert on wound care. ''When you see high levels of wounds, you usually see a high level of dysfunctional staff,'' he said.
HCA owned eight of the 15 worst hospitals for bedsores among 545 profit-making hospitals nationwide, each with more than 1,000 patient discharges, tracked by the Sunlight Foundation using Medicare data from October 2008 to June 2010. HCA's West Houston Medical Center and CJW Medical Center in Richmond, Va., landed near the top of the list.
HCA says it has increased its nursing staff at its hospitals each year over the last five years. But an examination of lawsuits shows bedsore problems have been persistent at several HCA facilities. In Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire, a 60-year-old woman died in 2009 after her bedsores went untreated for three days and became infected, according to a wrongful-death lawsuit filed in the spring of 2011 in federal court against the hospital. HCA denied the claims in court documents.
And bedsores were partly responsible for forever altering the life of George Clay Chandler, a lieutenant in the Clay County sheriff's office in north Florida. Five years ago, Mr. Chandler decided to undergo weight-loss surgery. A mountain of a man at 6-foot-1 and 375 pounds, Mr. Chandler entered Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville for what seemed like a relatively simple operation.
But when Mr. Chandler emerged two months later, he was a changed man. He was unable to speak. His eyes were badly damaged, his limbs contorted, and he suffered from a large, painful bedsore on his buttock.
While some of Mr. Chandler's injuries occurred at the hands of an inexperienced surgeon, according to a lawsuit in a county court, many more developed while he lay, virtually unattended, in the hospital's critical care unit. One nurse, who quit Memorial after repeatedly warning executives about what she saw as a shortage of qualified nurses on staff, testified that Mr. Chandler's bedsores could have been easily prevented.
Memorial was the focus of six civil lawsuits by former patients who claimed, among other things, that they had received poor care and suffered bedsores. Five of those lawsuits were settled for undisclosed sums.
The hospital was cited twice by Florida regulators, in 2008 and 2010, for having inadequate numbers of nurses on its staff to oversee wound care for patients. During the 2010 examination, regulators noted that Memorial had less than the equivalent of two full-time nurses who specialized in wound care to treat the 132 patients who required aid.
''The system of treatment for wound care places patients at risk for additional medical complications,'' the examiners said.
The hospital said it had taken corrective measures in response to the shortfalls cited by Florida regulators.
HCA says its hospitals have improved and, citing its own internal analysis, says its rate of bedsores is now below the national average. ''We recognize some hospitals within our company are achieving better results than others, and this provides opportunities to learn from our top performers and apply those lessons broadly,'' the company said in a statement last year.
Earlier this year, a jury awarded Mr. Chandler and his family $178 million in damages. This month, Memorial and HCA, which had appealed the jury's verdict, reached a confidential settlement with Mr. Chandler's family.

HEADLINE: Atlas Spurned

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BURNS. 
Jennifer Burns, an assistant professor of history at Stanford, is the author of ''Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right.''

 BODY:
Palo Alto, Calif.EARLY in his Congressional career, Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin representative and presumptive Republican vice-presidential nominee, would give out copies of Ayn Rand's book ''Atlas Shrugged'' as Christmas presents. He described the novelist of heroic capitalism as ''the reason I got into public service.'' But what would Rand think of Mr. Ryan?
While Rand, an atheist, did enjoy a good Christmas celebration for its cheerful commercialism, she would have scoffed at the idea of public service. And though Mr. Ryan's advocacy of steep cuts in government spending would have pleased her, she would have vehemently opposed his social conservatism and hawkish foreign policy. She would have denounced Mr. Ryan as she denounced Ronald Reagan, for trying ''to take us back to the Middle Ages, via the unconstitutional union of religion and politics.'' 
Mr. Ryan's youthful, feverish embrace of Rand and his clumsy attempts to distance himself from her is more than the flip-flopping of an ambitious politician: it is a window into the ideological fissures at the heart of modern conservatism.
Rand's atheism and social libertarianism have long placed her in an uneasy position in the pantheon of conservative heroes, but she has proved irresistible to those who came of age in the baby boom and after. They found her iconoclasm thrilling, and her admirers poured into Barry M. Goldwater's doomed 1964 presidential campaign, the Libertarian Party and the Cato Institute. After her death, in 1982, it became even easier for her admirers to ignore the parts of her message they didn't like and focus on her advocacy of unfettered capitalism and her celebration of the individual.
Mr. Ryan is particularly taken by Rand's black-and-white worldview. ''The fight we are in here,'' he once told a group of her adherents, ''is a fight of individualism versus collectivism.'' If she were alive, he said, Rand would do ''a great job in showing us just how wrong what government is doing is.''
Rand's anti-government argument rested on another binary opposition, between ''producers'' who create wealth and ''moochers'' who feed off them. This theme has endeared Rand, and Mr. Ryan, to the Tea Party, whose members believe they are the only ones who deserve government aid.
Yet when his embrace of Rand drew fire from Catholic leaders, Mr. Ryan reversed course with a speed that would make his running mate, Mitt Romney, proud. ''Don't give me Ayn Rand,'' he told National Review earlier this year. ''Give me Thomas Aquinas.'' He claimed that his austere budget was motivated by the Catholic principle of subsidiarity, which holds that issues should be handled at the most local level possible, rather than Rand's anti-government views.
This retreat to religion would have infuriated Rand, who believed it was impossible to separate government policies from their moral and philosophical underpinnings. Policies motivated by Christian values, which she called ''the best kindergarten of communism possible,'' were inherently corrupt.
Free-market capitalism, she said, needed a new, secular morality of selfishness, one she promoted in her novels, nonfiction and newsletters. Conservative contemporaries would have none of it: William F. Buckley Jr. criticized her ''desiccated philosophy'' and Whittaker Chambers dubbed her ''Big Sister.''
Mr. Ryan's rise is a telling index of how far conservatism has evolved from its founding principles. The creators of the movement embraced the free market, but shied from Rand's promotion of capitalism as a moral system. They emphasized the practical benefits of capitalism, not its ethics. Their fidelity to Christianity grew into a staunch social conservatism that Rand fought against in vain.
Mr. Ryan has attempted a similar pirouette, but it is too late: driven by the fever of the Tea Party and drawing upon a wellspring of enthusiasm for Rand, politicians like Mr. Ryan have set the philosophy of ''Atlas Shrugged'' at the core of modern Republicanism.
In so doing, modern conservatives ignore the fundamental principles that animated Rand: personal as well as economic freedom. Her philosophy sprang from her deep belief in the autonomy and independence of each individual. This meant that individuals could not depend on government for retirement savings or medical care. But it also meant that individuals must be free from government interference in their personal lives.
Years before Roe v. Wade, Rand called abortion ''a moral right which should be left to the sole discretion of the woman involved.'' She condemned the military draft and American involvement in Vietnam. She warned against recreational drugs but thought government had no right to ban them. These aspects of Rand do not fit with a political view that weds fiscal and social conservatism.
Mr. Ryan's selection as Mr. Romney's running mate is the kind of stinging rebuke of the welfare state that Rand hoped to see during her lifetime. But Mr. Ryan is also what she called ''a conservative in the worst sense of the word.'' As a woman in a man's world, a Jewish atheist in a country dominated by Christianity and a refugee from a totalitarian state, Rand knew it was not enough to promote individual freedom in the economic realm alone. If Mr. Ryan becomes the next vice president, it wouldn't be her dream come true, but her nightmare.

HEADLINE: An Ex-Wrestling Executive Wins a G.O.P. Primary

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Robert Davey and Elizabeth Maker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Linda E. McMahon, a former wrestling executive, easily captured Connecticut's Republican Senate primary on Tuesday night, clinching a second chance to run for a position she failed to win two years ago.In defeating Christopher Shays, a former United States representative and longtime fixture in moderate politics in the state, Ms. McMahon underscored the power of being an outside candidate, as well as a wealthy one. She outspent her opponent nearly 12 to 1, and flooded the airwaves with advertisements promoting herself as a political maverick who could bring common sense to Washington.
It appeared that Mr. Shays, who held his House seat for two decades before losing his bid to keep it in 2008, was tripped up by the Washington experience and centrist viewpoints that once made him one of the more popular Republicans in a left-leaning state. 
Before a roaring crowd in Stamford, Ms. McMahon took the stage hours after her win and told supporters that she would jump-start a stagnant economy. ''We need to give all these career politicians in Washington who have agreed to this mess a pink slip!'' she said.
Mr. Shays met reporters at his sparse campaign headquarters and said he would support his opponent in the general election. Ms. McMahon's millions, he added, ''trumped the experience we bring to the table.''
Ms. McMahon will face Representative Christopher S. Murphy, a Democrat, in the November election for the seat being vacated by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, an Independent. Mr. Murphy won his primary on Tuesday, by a wide margin over his opponent, Susan Bysiewicz, a former secretary of the state.
Elizabeth Esty, a former state representative, won the Democratic nomination to replace Mr. Murphy in his Congressional seat. Ms. Esty beat Christopher G. Donovan, the speaker of the State House, who was an early favorite until a federal investigation into his fund-raising practices led to conspiracy charges against several of his aides. Andrew Roraback, a state senator, will be Ms. Esty's Republican opponent.
In 2010, Ms. McMahon spent tens of millions of dollars of her own fortune in her Senate bid, only to lose to Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, despite a political climate that year that propelled Republicans to the leadership of the House.
Mr. Shays, who is on a first-name basis with many of his former Fairfield County constituents, earned the endorsement of Connecticut's major newspapers this year. But Ms. McMahon, absorbing the lessons of her defeat, waged a large campaign with an emphasis on jobs and her personal story, including her stewardship of World Wrestling Entertainment, which appeared to resonate with some voters Tuesday.
''We like Chris Shays, but I tend to think he's a career politician. He's been in government a long, long time,'' said Roy Ferris, 76, a retired telephone repairman from Fairfield who voted on Tuesday morning with his wife, Peggy. Both pulled the lever for Ms. McMahon.
''We need people who have gone through the challenges they have to face to run a business,'' Mr. Ferris said. ''She's got business experience. She's been very successful at it.''
In Westport, Georgene Huber, 81, voted for Mr. Shays ''because he's been a friend all these years.'' But her husband, William, 84, a retired executive at United Technologies, said he had grown more conservative of late.
''We have to have someone who can turn things around,'' he said, after voting for Ms. McMahon. ''We need the entrepreneurial spirit again in our country.''
Earlier on Tuesday, Mr. Shays said in an interview that he would not challenge Ms. McMahon in November as an Independent. ''I have run as a Republican 20 times,'' he said. ''I never would consider it.''
In Fairfield, Kelly Kowalsky, 50, who works for Clear Channel Communications, said she was voting for Ms. McMahon. Did she consider the wrestling executive inexperienced in government?
''That's an absolute plus,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Utility's Role In Convention Tests Obama

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- When Charlotte first emerged as the top contender to host the Democratic convention, its lead cheerleader was James E. Rogers, the outspoken chief executive of the hometown utility, Duke Energy. He promised to be a public face and a private fund-raiser for the effort.Mr. Rogers has not only solicited donations but has also arranged for his company to donate office space and guarantee a loan to the convention committee.
He cited local pride as motivation, but Duke Energy, which became the nation's largest utility with its recent merger, also had a business incentive. The company, which has supported the energy initiatives of President Obama and Congressional Democrats, has received federal economic stimulus money and alternative-energy grants. Its financial future stands to be greatly influenced by the sorts of environmental proposals the president's party has vowed to pursue.
The intersection of Duke Energy's interests and its support for the convention is testing Mr. Obama's pledge to free the party's gathering from business and lobbyist support. 
The situation is a microcosm of a larger issue that Mr. Obama's campaign has faced. It has tried to balance the president's longtime pledge to reduce the influence of special interests in politics with his real-world need to raise the huge amounts of money that modern campaigns require, at times in ways that seem to contradict those pledges.
Republicans are accusing the convention organizers of hypocrisy. Some Democrats are saying the White House set itself up for the charges by making a vow that was bound to be difficult to keep and that would risk alienating its business supporters.
Duke has found its task a thankless one. Some of its conservative shareholders have accused the company of getting too cozy with the administration. Some Democrats have complained that Mr. Rogers has not done enough to raise the money necessary for the convention. And whatever Mr. Rogers's fund-raising success, it was not enough to stop a Democratic group from implying nefarious connections between the utility and the Republican candidate for governor here, Pat McCrory.
It is hardly what Obama campaign officials envisioned last year when they sent a note to supporters from Michelle Obama promising ''a different convention for a different time.''
Some longtime Democratic fund-raisers viewed the restrictions as naïve at best, given that the sources of more than two-thirds of the money raised for the 2008 convention would be banned now, based on a study by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute.
''There's an inconsistency in trying to be purer than Caesar's wife by not taking corporate money,'' said Bob Farmer, a treasurer of Senator John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. ''It just makes it harder on his fund-raising team, and maybe they even have to cut some corners to make sure their coffers are filled.''
Campaign and convention officials said that they had received money from an ''exponentially'' greater number of individual donors to the convention as intended and that they had indisputably reduced their reliance on corporate help.
Neither party is reporting blockbuster convention fund-raising. Big donors now tend to be less interested in giving money for what is viewed as a big party than in giving it directly to the campaigns or to the outside groups playing such a big role this year. Republicans and Democrats alike say that they will meet their budgets but that they will probably have to continue seeking donations to the end.
The parties receive $18.2 million in public financing, but their programs are calling for about triple that. Neither would share fund-raising figures or details, which do not have to be made public until later this year.
Still, the job is that much easier for Republicans, who have had no rules against accepting corporate money for their convention in Tampa, Fla.
''From an economic development perspective,'' said Ken Jones, the president of the Republican convention's host committee, ''this helps the community showcase itself to the world and helps create jobs, and these are laudable goals, whether it's corporate or individual money.''
Duke Energy has a lot riding on administration policy. The company was awarded $204 million in stimulus money in 2010 to modernize its power grids and a $22 million grant in 2009 to develop wind energy technologies, following similar incentives from the Bush administration. Far more important would be any aggressive move to address concerns about global warming by changing the way emissions are regulated.
Duke split with much of its industry to support the ''cap and trade'' system that House Democrats unsuccessfully sought to enact early in Mr. Obama's term. It was part of a coalition of like-minded corporate and environmental groups that helped develop the approach.
Mr. Rogers has said he joined the effort to protect the interests of his company and its customers, arguing that he was compelled to do so given that Duke's reliance on coal would potentially increase its exposure to the legislation's costs. But at a meeting in May 2011, a shareholder activist, Thomas Borelli, accused Mr. Rogers of ''joining President Obama's war on fossil fuels'' and suggested that Mr. Rogers was angling for a job in the administration by helping the convention, which he denied.
In an interview, Mr. Rogers said he expected to receive no favoritism in return for Duke's contributions. ''I'm doing this because it's great for Charlotte, and it's great for North Carolina,'' he said.
His cooperation was not enough to persuade a Democratic group, North Carolina Citizens for Progress, to heed Duke's call to drop an advertisement implying that Mr. McCrory inappropriately did the utility's bidding while splitting his time as Charlotte's mayor and a Duke Energy development executive.
Nor has it insulated Mr. Rogers from Democratic criticism that a state investigation into Duke's recent merger with Progress Energy has distracted from his fund-raising commitments.
Mr. Rogers's supporters insist that he has kept pace, even as they acknowledge that the fund-raising restrictions pose challenges.
Mr. Rogers said he did not learn about the rules until after Charlotte had been all but announced as the host. ''From the beginning of time, conventions have been funded by corporations, by PACs, by lobbyists,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''And so we went into this thinking we would do that in that traditional way.''
But, he added, ''we have taken the challenge, and we are working hard to raise the money under this new set of rules.''
Yet those rules have allowed Duke to contribute in other ways. The company guaranteed a $10 million credit line to the convention committee, money that would have to be paid back but raised questions nonetheless. And it donated several floors of prime uptown office space to the convention.
That sort of ''in kind'' contribution is allowed under the Democratic guidelines. But advocates for tighter limits on corporate influence question the difference between donations of cash and real estate.
''I don't see the distinction,'' said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the nonpartisan group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ''It's just a way to try and have your cake and eat it too.''
Prompting further charges of hypocrisy from Republicans, organizers started another fund, New American City, that accepts direct corporate donations, including from Charlotte companies like Bank of America and Duke itself. Planners said the fund was primarily for events outside the convention hall, like the opening party for the news media and a Labor Day festival open to the public, giving local companies a role in promoting their city.
Mr. Rogers said he could handle the 360-degree criticism.
''I kind of understand the sport, and you know, no good deed goes unpunished,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''I guess it just goes with the territory.''

HEADLINE: When Cruelty Is Cute

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD. 
Thomas L. Friedman is off today.

 BODY:
WASHINGTONI'd been wondering how long it would take Republicans to realize that Paul Ryan is their guy.
He's the cutest package that cruelty ever came in. He has a winning air of sad cheerfulness. He's affable, clean cut and really cut, with the Irish altar-boy widow's peak and droopy, winsome blue eyes and unashamed sentimentality.
Who better to rain misery upon the heads of millions of Americans? 
He's Scrooge disguised as a Pickwick, an ideologue disguised as a wonk. Not since Ronald Reagan tried to cut the budget by categorizing ketchup and relish as vegetables has the G.O.P. managed to find such an attractive vessel to mask harsh policies with a smiling face.
The Young Gun and former prom king is a fan of deer hunting, catfish noodling, heavy metal and Beethoven. He's a great dad who says the cheese, bratwurst and beer of Wisconsin flow in his veins. He's so easy to like -- except that his politics are just a teensy bit heartless.
Rush Limbaugh hails Ryan as ''the last Boy Scout,'' noting that the tall, slender 42-year-old is a true believer: ''We now have somebody on the ticket who's us.''
For the rest of us, at least, Ryan is not going to raise our hopes only to dash them. Unlike W., he's not even going to make a feint at ''compassionate conservatism.'' Why bother with some silly scruple or toehold of conscience?
Unlike some of the right-wing ayatollahs, Ryan doesn't threaten with moral and cultural gusts of sulfur. He seems more like a friendly guidance counselor who wants to teach us how to live, get us in shape, PowerPoint away the social safety net to make the less advantaged more self-reliant, as he makes the rich richer. Burning the village it takes to save it, so we can avoid the fiscal cliff, or as he and his fellow conservative Cassandras ominously call it, ''the debt bomb.''
Like Mitt Romney, Ryan truly believes he made it on his own, so everyone else can, too. He shrugs off the advantage of starting as the white guy from an affluent family, able to breeze into a summer internship for a Wisconsin Republican senator as a college student.
Only 16 and the youngest of four when he discovered his lawyer dad dead in bed from a heart attack at 55, Ryan had to grow up fast.
The Midwestern kid was guided by what David Stockman calls ''Irving Kristol's ex-Trotskyites'' turned neo-cons; Jack Kemp, the cheery supply-sider who actually cared about the disadvantaged, and by one of Kemp's favorite authors, Russian émigré and cult leader Ayn (pronounced like swine, as she used to say) Rand.
''And the fight we are in here, make no mistake about it, is a fight of individualism versus collectivism,'' Ryan said in a 2005 speech to the Atlas Society. He even gave copies of ''Atlas Shrugged'' to staffers at Christmas. He did not emulate Rand on everything, given that she adamantly opposed Ronald Reagan, saying, ''Since he denies the right to abortion, he cannot be a defender of any rights.''
Ryan co-sponsored the Sanctity of Life Act enshrining a fertilized egg with the definition of ''personhood'' and supported a bill Democrats nicknamed the ''Let Women Die Act,'' which would have let hospitals that get federal money deny women abortions even in life-threatening circumstances.
And Rand would not have approved of Ryan's votes in the House backing W.'s profligate spending on unwinnable wars, a bank bailout and a Medicare expansion. She would no doubt have been thrilled, however, that under the Ryan budget plan, the megarich Romney would go from paying shamefully as little as possible in taxes to virtually no taxes.
Ryan was drawn to Rand's novels, with their rejection of ''the altruist morality,'' making narcissism a social virtue; her exhortation that man must not only strive for ''physical values'' -- her heroes were hot -- and self-made wealth, but a ''self-made soul.'' Like John Galt, who traces a dollar sign ''over the desolate earth'' at the end of ''Atlas Shrugged,'' Rand idolized the dollar. She wore a brooch shaped like a dollar sign, and a 6-foot dollar sign stood beside her coffin at her wake.
Although the Catholic Ryan told Fox News's Brit Hume in an interview that aired Tuesday night that he ''completely disagreed'' with Rand's ''atheistic philosophy,'' he said his interest in economics was ''triggered'' by her.
His long infatuation with her makes him seem even younger than he looks with his cowlick because Randism is a state of arrested adolescence, making its disciples feel like heroic teenagers atop a lofty mountain peak.
The secretive, ambiguous Romney was desperate for ideological clarity, so he outsourced his political identity to Ryan, a numbers guy whose numbers don't add up.
This just proves that Romney will never get over his anxiety about not being conservative enough. As president, he'd still feel the need to prove himself with right-wing Supreme Court picks.
Ryan should stop being so lovable. People who intend to hurt other people should wipe the smile off their faces.

HEADLINE: Little Candor From Christie Before Keynote

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com; Twitter: @powellnyt

 BODY:
It didn't take long for the watch-it, buster, I'm-a-bodacious-truth-teller verbiage to start flowing.Mitt Romney publicly tapped Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey as the keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention, and within hours, Mr. Christie promised to deliver ''very direct and hard truths'' to the American people.
''Fixing these problems is not going to be easy for any of them,'' he warned USA Today. 
If the governor is in a mood for genuine candor about the economy, he could make one hell of a speech. His once prosperous state has lately become a national laggard.
Last year, New Jersey ranked 47th in economic growth, and as The Record newspaper noted, its economy shrank by 0.5 percent, even as the economies of 43 other states grew. State employment figures also do not offer much comfort.
Mr. Christie took office in 2010, when the state unemployment rate was 9.7 percent, 35th in the nation. Now it is 9.6 percent, ranking 48th.
Mr. Christie has passed the summer traveling the length of the Jersey Shore, stomping into towns like a sideshow barker. He thumps about the ''New Jersey comeback'' and grouses that ''Corzine Democrats'' (a reference to Jon S. Corzine, the former governor) prevent him from delivering a 10 percent income tax cut for all residents.
Unfortunately, the governor confronts a more pressing problem. His state does not possess nearly enough tax revenue to afford such a cut. Its unemployment fund is exhausted; its coffers are nearly empty.
Analyst after analyst presses an ear to the chest of this state, and none particularly like what they hear. Mr. Christie likes to note that private-sector jobs are growing.
This is true. It's also true that leisure and hospitality jobs are growing fastest. Such jobs tend to be seasonal, temporary, low paying and accompanied by weak benefits.
''The comeback is rolling,'' Mr. Christie told a crowd in Brant Beach a few weeks back. ''We just need to pour gasoline on it.''
The image could call to mind a bonfire, or a funeral pyre.
Mr. Christie can talk at the convention of hard-earned victories. He led a bruising and successful effort to rein in pension and health costs. And, after battering the teachers union, he cut a deal to reform tenure, tying job security more directly to performance.
The governor, too, is a boisterous guardian of his public image; his video team follows him everywhere and spins out product as if it is a runaway MTV unit. (Here's the Guv shouting down a man in Seaside Heights. Here's the Guv rolling his eyes at a teacher in Woodbridge.)
There are some admirable Christie outtakes, as well. As Matt Katz of The Philadelphia Inquirer writes, the governor has been quite stand-up in defending Muslim Americans against attacks from critics in his own party.
So during Ramadan he addressed a crowd gathered for an Iftar dinner at the governor's mansion. ''In many publications around this country I'm now called an Islamist,'' Mr. Christie said. ''Listen, I've been called worse things -- usually on the boardwalk on Seaside Heights. Y'all saw my reaction to that.''
He spoke of ''bigots'' and a ''gaze of intolerance that is going around our country that is disturbing to me.''
So he's complicated, this blustery, Springsteen-loving governor who harbors presidential ambitions. We've not even touched on his considerable taste for patronage -- The Record made an admirable attempt to count the governor's many friends, admirers, party loyalists and contributors tucked away in the recesses of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
My personal favorite was the food broker and party loyalist who landed a job as an $85,000 financial analyst.
In the end, of course, none of this really matters. Any keynote is about myth and narrative and storytelling. And no doubt a glimmer of future possibility attends. A hitherto little known Democratic candidate for the Senate gave a thumper of a speech in 2004, and that worked out all right for Barack Obama.
But Mr. Christie would do well to dampen expectations. Most keynote speakers exit into history's shadow.
Consider recent Republican keynote speakers: former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani remains a former mayor; former Gov. Zell Miller of Georgia is in private practice; and rising House star Susan Molinari is no longer rising and no longer in Congress.
Perhaps Mr. Christie should plan on a few more years traveling up and down the Jersey Shore.

HEADLINE: Russia's Veto Diplomacy

BYLINE: By DENIS CORBOY, WILLIAM COURTNEY and KENNETH YALOWITZ

 BODY:
The overuse of veto rights -- such as blocking three United Nations Security Council resolutions on Syria -- has reduced Russia's international standing and contributed to its growing isolation. Unless the Kremlin becomes more pragmatic and softens its dealings with other nations and institutions, the country will see its influence further erode.Last month, Russia and China angered Western and Arab countries by vetoing a Security Council move to impose economic sanctions on Syria if Bashar al-Assad's regime failed to implement an international peace plan. In February, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton characterized an earlier veto by Russia and China of a resolution condemning the Assad regime's crackdown on its own people as a ''travesty,'' and said that ''friends of a democratic Syria'' would take action. They have, and now Russia is at the margins of international planning for a post-Assad future and assistance for Syria. 
Russia has sidelined itself before. In 2011 the Kremlin opposed international military action in Libya to protect civilians and aid opponents of Muammar el-Qaddafi. (Vladimir Putin, then the country's prime minister, likened the effort to a ''medieval call for a crusade.'') During the lead-up to the war in Iraq, Russia's drawn-out support for Saddam Hussein in the face of his regime's growing international isolation alienated many Iraqis. In neither country today does Russia enjoy much gratitude or influence.
Negative diplomacy has harmed Russia elsewhere. In 1999, it vetoed U.N. authorization of military action to force the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces from Kosovo, leaving NATO to intervene to halt Slobodan Milosevic's repression of the province's ethnic Albanians -- over the Kremlin's vehement objections. More recently, Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008, which President Putin admitted last week was preplanned, and its recognition of the ''independence'' of the separatist areas of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, aroused widespread condemnation.
By preventing the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe from working in the rebellious North Caucasus, Moscow forgoes a valuable tool to foster reconciliation in a region that presents a rising threat to Russia's territorial integrity.
Moscow's use of natural gas exports as a political weapon against Ukraine and Belarus has caused European customers to see Russia as an unreliable supplier and pursue alternatives. Abuse of the former Russian pipeline monopoly has caused Caspian energy producers to find alternative ways to reach world markets.
Other powers employ negative diplomacy, but without isolating themselves. Although the United States has vetoed more U.N. Security Council resolutions since 1972 than any other permanent member, often to forestall criticism of Israel, Washington maintains good ties with moderate Arab states. China is also not reticent to exercise its veto power, but a substantial economy and rising foreign aid and investment ensure that Beijing retains broad influence.
Russian diplomacy is not all negative. Moscow encourages efforts to avert the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, such as cosponsoring the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. Russia also facilitates logistical support for NATO forces in Afghanistan. On the Arctic Council -- which includes the United States, Canada and other Arctic coastal states -- Moscow cooperates on environmental and scientific research, conservation and maritime search and rescue efforts. And it supports the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea as the basis to resolve boundary disputes in the resource-rich Arctic Ocean. Long ambivalent about the World Trade Organization, Russia has finally become a member, the last large economy to join.
What separates Russia from China and other powers is the weight of negative diplomacy in its overall foreign engagement. Since resuming the presidency in May, Putin has reinforced this direction, perhaps most notably by his continued support for the increasingly brutal Assad regime. Not surprisingly, these and other actions have left Russia with a diminishing list of friends.
There is no question that the world community would benefit from a strong, more cooperative Russia. Moscow in turn could increase respect for Russia's international status by building democracy, strengthening its economy, forging mutually beneficial ties with others, and emphasizing the tools of soft power. In the international climate of the 21st century, even the greatest powers can achieve their goals only by attracting allies and partners. Russia is no exception.

HEADLINE: Obama-Ryan Battle Intensifies Over Medicare Savings

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Representative Paul D. Ryan's budget blueprint assumes the same amount of Medicare savings as President Obama's health care law, even though Mitt Romney and Mr. Ryan have said those cuts would be devastating to millions of older Americans on Medicare.As the partisan brawl over Medicare continued on Tuesday and threatened to become the focus of the race, the Obama campaign said that Mr. Ryan's budget plan -- broadly endorsed by Mr. Romney -- ''would end Medicare as we know it'' and shift costs to beneficiaries.
The Republicans hit back on Tuesday with a television commercial asserting that the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan was better for older Americans. 
''You paid into Medicare for years, every paycheck,'' the advertisement says. ''Now when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare. Why? To pay for Obamacare. So now the money you paid for your guaranteed health care is going to a massive new government program that's not for you.''
Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, said, ''Mitt Romney's Medicare ad is dishonest and hypocritical.'' The savings, she said, ''do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit.''
In an interview with Fox News on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan said he welcomed the back and forth.
''This is a debate we want to have,'' he said. ''We're the ones who are offering a plan to save Medicare, to protect Medicare, to strengthen Medicare.''
With 50 million beneficiaries, Medicare is a major concern for both parties. The current fight centers on changes in the program made in the new health law, the Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010 without Republican votes.
Mr. Obama would use the savings to help offset the cost of covering the uninsured, as well as to improve the financial condition of the Medicare trust fund. Mr. Ryan says he would use the money to shore up Medicare and to help reduce budget deficits.
Republicans won control of the House in 2010 partly by arguing that Democrats had raided Medicare to pay for Mr. Obama's health care law. Democrats hope to deflect such attacks this year by pointing out that Mr. Ryan's budget plan, approved twice by the House, includes similar savings -- roughly $700 billion from 2013 to 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Those savings have a complicated history.
Mr. Ryan's budget plan was approved in March by the House Budget Committee, of which he is chairman. Before the vote, committee members discussed the budget plan and the Medicare provisions in detail.
Representative Allyson Y. Schwartz, Democrat of Pennsylvania, asked whether the savings in the Affordable Care Act -- ''sometimes referred to as cuts to Medicare'' -- were part of Mr. Ryan's budget.
Austin Smythe, the panel's Republican staff director, said: ''We assume those savings. We devote them to solvency of Medicare and to deficit reduction, instead of covering the expansions.''
At another point, Mr. Smythe said, ''We assume the repeal of all of the expansions in the Affordable Care Act.''
Those expansions, he said, include subsidies to help low- and middle-income people buy private insurance. Democrats said that repeal of the new law would also wipe out new Medicare benefits, like additional coverage of prescription drugs and preventive services.
The House approved the Ryan budget plan on March 29 by a vote of 228 to 191, with all but 10 Republicans voting for it.
Mr. Romney has offered a Medicare proposal similar to Mr. Ryan's. But the Romney campaign said Tuesday that Mr. Romney would restore the money being squeezed out of Medicare by the 2010 health law.
''Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have always been fully committed to repealing Obamacare, ending President Obama's $716 billion raid on Medicare, and tackling the serious fiscal challenges our country faces,'' said Lanhee Chen, the policy director for the Romney campaign. ''A Romney-Ryan administration will restore the funding to Medicare.''
The Ryan plan, like any budget resolution, specifies levels of spending, savings and revenues, based on certain policy assumptions. But, as Mr. Smythe pointed out, ''the committees of jurisdiction determine the details'' in separate legislation.
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Obama would impose similar overall constraints on Medicare spending, stipulating that average spending per beneficiary should not grow faster than the economy, measured by the per capita output of goods and services, plus one-half of one percentage point.
However, they would achieve the goal in different ways.
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney would limit the government's current open-ended financial commitment to Medicare. The government would contribute a fixed amount of money on behalf of each beneficiary, and future beneficiaries could use the money to buy private insurance or to help pay for coverage under the traditional Medicare program.
The new health care law, by contrast, will reduce projected Medicare payments to health maintenance organizations, hospitals and many other health care providers. As a backstop, to ensure savings, the law creates a Medicare cost control board. Cuts recommended by the board would take effect automatically unless Congress voted to block or change them.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan would abolish the panel, which they describe as a tool for rationing health care.

HEADLINE: Obama Returns to Iowa in Bid to Reignite the Fervor

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
OSKALOOSA, Iowa -- This prairie state is the place where his unlikely bid for presidency began. But now it is 2012, and the big question for President Obama is whether, four years after that historic run, Iowa can do for him what it did in 2008.Midway through a three-day bus tour in which he is traveling from the Nebraska border through windmill farms and dried-out cornfields east toward Illinois, Mr. Obama is trying hard to reignite that fire, using the considerable arsenal at his disposal.
He is using the executive reach of the presidency -- he began his trip on Monday announcing $170 million for aid to farmers and ranchers afflicted by the drought. He is using the natural props that this state has always provided for the legions of politicians who flock here -- posing for a photo with the Iowa State Fair pageant queen and loudly demanding, in front of reporters at the fairgrounds, his helping of ''pork chop on a stick.'' 
(He got two on Monday evening, but alas, they were on a paper plate instead of a stick, and no one remembered to supply the president with utensils, leaving him to wail plaintively at the crowd: ''Someone's got to have a knife and fork!'')
And he is using his own well-known gift as an orator to try to get the flame going again.
''The centerpiece of Mr. Romney's entire economic plan is to give another $5 trillion tax cut,'' mostly to the rich, Mr. Obama told a campaign audience of around 800 here. ''Understand this is not asking you to pay more taxes to reduce our deficit, or to help kids get an education, or rebuild some roads -- it's asking you to pay more to give an extra tax break to people making $250,000 or more a year.''
The president is mixing in campaign rallies with tête-à-têtes with local business owners. At Coffee Connection in Knoxville, Mr. Obama even talked with a Republican, the cafe's owner, Mark Raymie. (A campaign aide told amused reporters afterward that ''we don't party-ID people when we go to local establishments.'')
He chatted with patrons of the coffee shop about White House beer -- apparently brewed on the grounds at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- and when one man evinced an interest, the president sent out to his bus, Ground Force One, to get him a bottle. Then he wrote an excuse slip for a woman who was going to be late for work because of her presidential shoulder-rubbing.
He alluded to Mitt Romney's strapping his family's dog to the roof of a car during a vacation, connecting the long-ago story to what he called Mr. Romney's dismissal of wind energy proposals.
Mr. Obama told a Waterloo, Iowa, audience Tuesday night that Mr. Romney had said ''you can't drive a car with a windmill on it.'' Then the president grinned, getting to his punch line: ''I mean, maybe he's tried it. He's put other things on the roof.''
It remains anyone's guess whether Mr. Obama can replicate the magic of 2008, and to become a two-term president, he dearly needs Iowa. A swing state, it has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country, though its booming farm economy has been hurt by the drought.
Mr. Obama's Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, sent his new running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, here on Monday on Mr. Ryan's first solo foray on the campaign trail, a sign of how much the Republicans want to win this state's six electoral votes.
It will be hard for Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan to outdo the Obama ground operation here -- it remained largely in place after 2008 and was one of the first places the Obama campaign revved up again for the 2012 cycle. But the Romney camp, sensing the potential to plug into a larger disenchantment with the overall national employment picture, has blanketed the state in advertising and appearances by surrogates and the candidate himself.
At an appearance at the Nelson Pioneer Farm and Museum here on Tuesday, the president conceded that he was being outspent, saying, ''They've got people writing $10 million checks.''
Mr. Obama continued: ''All the ads are the same. They say 'the economy's not doing well and it's Obama's fault.' '' He called that a strategy to win an election, not a plan to turn around the economy.
At the centerpiece of Mr. Obama's bus tour is his broader electoral strategy: to hold the states won by Democrats in the last three elections, and then to find the additional 28 electoral votes he needs from a combination of other swing states, like Iowa (6 votes), Ohio (18 votes), Virginia (13 votes) or New Hampshire, Colorado and New Mexico.
Polls in Iowa are very close to the national average, showing a tight race, with more showing Mr. Obama holding a slight lead rather than Mr. Romney.
Mr. Obama on Tuesday called on Congress to extend expiring tax credits for wind energy production. A White House spokesman said a new Energy Department report indicated that wind power installations surged in 2011.
The report seemed timed to coincide with the president's trip to Iowa, where his motorcade whizzed past countless windmills as it traversed Interstate 80 and rural roads. The report said that 75,000 jobs in the country now depend on wind power.

HEADLINE: America's Aversion To Taxes

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
There is something to be said for universal health care systems.When my son developed a rash on an Italian vacation in Liguria last month, the pharmacist showed me to the doctor downstairs, who diagnosed the problem at no charge and sent me off with a handshake and a joke about a daughter in med school at the University of California, San Diego.
Italy may be in a funk, with a shrinking economy and a high unemployment rate, but the United States can learn a lot from it, and not just about the benefits of public health care. Italians live longer. Their poverty rate is much lower than ours. If they lose their jobs or suffer some other misfortune, they can turn to a more generous social safety net.
Every developed country aspires to provide a better life for its people. The United States, among the richest of all, fails in important ways. It has the highest poverty and the highest infant mortality among developed nations. We provide among the least generous unemployment benefits in the industrial world. Not long ago one of the most educated countries in the world, the United States is slipping behind. 
The reason is not difficult to figure out: rich though we are, we can't afford the policies needed to improve our record. The politicians in Washington all know that we face a long-term fiscal crisis. By 2020, 70 million Americans are expected to be on Social Security, up from 45 million in 2000. The ranks on Medicare will swell to 64 million, up from 40 million in 2000. Virtually every economist knows that just maintaining Medicare and Medicaid benefits will require raising taxes on the middle class.
But though the nation's fiscal challenge has taken center stage in the presidential election campaign, raising more taxes from American families remains stubbornly off the table.
President Obama is willing to accept higher taxes on families earning over $250,000 a year. But he is going nowhere near higher taxes on the middle class. And Mitt Romney and his vice-presidential pick, Paul Ryan, are moving decidedly in the opposite direction. Not only do they want to extend indefinitely the tax cuts passed by President George W. Bush, but they are also calling for a piñata of additional ones, and would cut social spending in return.
Citizens of most industrial countries have demanded more public services as they have become richer. And they have been by and large willing to pay more taxes to finance them. Since 1965, tax revenue raised by governments in the developed world have risen to 34 percent of their gross domestic product from 25 percent, on average.
The big exception has been the United States. In 1965, taxes collected by federal, state and municipal governments amounted to 24.7 percent of the nation's output. In 2010, they amounted to 24.8 percent. Excluding Chile and Mexico, the United States raises less tax revenue, as a share of the economy, than every other industrial country.
No wonder we can't afford to keep more children alive. In 2007, the most recent year for which figures are available, the United States government spent about 16 percent of its output on social programs -- things like public health, food and housing for the poor. In Italy, that figure was 25 percent.
American policy makers justify our choice for low taxes with the claim that they foster economic growth. But the evidence is, at best, mixed. Since 1980, income per person has grown roughly the same across developed nations, about 300 percent, according to the International Monetary Fund. It has grown a little faster in the United States than in the European Union and Canada, but slower than in higher tax countries like Japan, Norway and Sweden.
To a large extent, this is because we have chosen a tax system that raises relatively little revenue and inflicts maximum economic harm. Every other industrial country has a national consumption tax, which can be used to raise a lot of money without distorting people's economic incentives. The United States, by contrast, relies mostly on taxes on labor and capital that damp people's drive to work and invest, putting a drag on economic growth. And the tax code is riddled with preferences and loopholes that further distort people's economic behavior.
It is tempting to blame the administration of George W. Bush for the tax shortfall. At the end of the administration of President Bill Clinton, tax revenue reached almost 30 percent of the nation's economic output. The federal government ran a budget surplus. The Bush tax cuts sharply reduced the federal tax collection. Then the Great Recession further eroded tax revenue. And, of course, nobody wants to raise taxes in the middle of an economic downturn.
Yet Americans' aversion to taxes runs deeper. We've been collecting less in taxes than other rich countries at least since the early 1970s, relative to size of the economy. But according to Gallup, only three times since the 1950s have more Americans said their taxes were ''about right'' than said they were ''too high.'' Scholars have resorted to cultural traits to explain our reluctance to pay for our government.
Alberto Alesina, an Italian-born economist at Harvard, contrasts American individualism rooted in the belief that effort brings success with Europeans' belief in state redistribution -- born of Europe's long history of inherited wealth. Americans who think they have a fair shot at striking it rich vote against high taxes on their expected future wealth. Europeans who believe wealth is mostly a matter of luck and connections are less resistant to paying taxes for collective welfare.
Support for taxes also depends on how the money is spent. In Italy and throughout Western Europe, every time a voter goes to the doctor, he or she sees taxes at work.
By contrast, the ethnic, linguistic and cultural diversity of the United States can sap support for government redistribution. Ten years ago, the sociologist William Julius Wilson wrote that American whites rebelled against welfare because they saw it as using their hard-earned taxes to give blacks ''medical and legal services that many of them could not afford for their own families.'' In more homogeneous European countries, taxpayers may be more willing to pay for social programs because recipients are similar to themselves.
Where does this leave American society? Many conservatives in the Tea Party movement believe the government is already too big. Mr. Romney and most Republicans in Congress have even signed a formal pledge not to raise income taxes. Will no administration ever again dare raise taxes on the middle class?
It may not be impossible for the American political system to accept the case for a bigger government, with higher taxes and better public services. Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush and Mr. Clinton passed tax increases to address budget deficits.
Bruce Bartlett, a tax expert who worked in the administrations of Mr. Reagan and the elder Mr. Bush, says he believes that the deteriorating budget outlook will ultimately persuade the political class. ''We need a few more years in which conservatives try to deal with the problem solely through spending,'' he said. ''We need to travel down this road a few more years and then people will recognize it is futile.''
There are tentative signs that Americans may become more willing to give money to Uncle Sam. Two of the three times that more Americans said their taxes were ''about right'' than ''too high'' have occurred since 2009. And the economic crisis might even increase support for government action.
The economists Paola Giuliano of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Antonio Spilimbergo of the International Monetary Fund found that Americans who experienced economic shocks tended to become more supportive of government redistribution, especially when the shock came in their late teens or early 20s.
When elections are decided by today's 18- to 25-year-olds, perhaps the American debate over taxes will come to resemble that in the rest of the world.

HEADLINE: Ryan Meets Casino Mogul and Major G.O.P. Donor

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL and NICHOLAS CONFESSORE; Trip Gabriel reported from Las Vegas, and Nicholas Confessore from New York.

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- Four days after his announcement as Mitt Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan was not in Florida talking Medicare with elderly voters or in drought-ridden Iowa talking about a farm bill. He traveled to the Venetian hotel here for a meeting hosted by Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino mogul who has pledged to spend as much as $100 million this year to defeat President Obama.Mr. Adelson has already contributed more money to defeat Mr. Obama than anyone: over $50 million has gone to the 2012 campaign, including $10 million to a ''super PAC'' backing Mr. Romney and $10 million to Crossroads GPS, which has run millions of dollars of advertisements against Mr. Obama.
In keeping with Mr. Adelson's penchant for staying below the radar, Romney aides refused to say who attended the meeting with Mr. Ryan, though the location (a private room at one of Mr. Adelson's hotels) and leaks from the Romney camp left little doubt. And in keeping with laws that prohibit elected officials from explicitly asking donors for super PAC money, aides to Mr. Romney insisted before the event that the meeting was not a fund-raiser. 
''It's a finance event, not a fund-raiser,'' an aide told reporters. Asked if people were paying to attend, he repeated, ''It's a finance event, not a fund-raiser.''
Monte Miller, a longtime Republican donor who planned to attend, described it as an opportunity for major contributors and influential Las Vegas Republicans to size up Mr. Ryan.
''I've watched Ryan for the last few years,'' Mr. Miller said. ''I think I know what he's going to bring. But I haven't been in the same room as him. I want to see his charisma and communication skills.''
The meeting, attended by several dozen guests, underlines that Mr. Ryan not only helps bring ideological ballast to the ticket but also is expected to have major appeal to donors.
The campaign said $3.5 million rolled in -- from large and small donors alike -- within 24 hours after Mr. Romney named him on Saturday, and Mr. Ryan's schedule through the party convention later this month quickly filled with 10 fund-raising events, including in Denver, Cleveland, Philadelphia and Detroit.
At each stop this week during a tour of battleground states, Mr. Ryan will attend fund-raising dinners and breakfasts in addition to public rallies.
Mr. Romney's relationship with Mr. Adelson, not always warm, has improved in recent months through private meetings between the two -- and by Mr. Romney's appearance at a fund-raiser in Jerusalem last month attended by Mr. Adelson, who holds hawkish views in support of Israel.
Mr. Ryan's connections to Mr. Adelson are looser -- the casino magnate does not appear to have donated to Mr. Ryan's campaigns or his political action committee -- and his opinions on Israel and the Middle East peace process are less well defined.
''It's a safe bet Israel will come up,'' said one Republican donor in Las Vegas who is a friend of Mr. Adelson.
But a closer connection with Mr. Adelson also holds risks for Mr. Ryan and the Republican ticket. Mr. Adelson's casino empire, which has made him a billionaire, is the subject of a federal investigation into whether his company, Las Vegas Sands, bribed Chinese officials to help him expand into the mainland. Mr. Adelson's company has denied any wrongdoing and has attributed the accusations to a disgruntled former executive.
At the fund-raiser Mr. Adelson attended in Jerusalem, Mr. Romney's assertion that cultural differences explained economic disparities between Israelis and Palestinians was criticized as ethnically insensitive. Mr. Romney also declared Jerusalem to be the capital of Israel and promised to move the United States Embassy there.
The Obama campaign seized on Mr. Ryan's new role to motivate Democratic donors, arguing that Mr. Romney chose his running mate to persuade wavering conservatives to open their wallets.
''Here's the calculation,'' Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, wrote in a fund-raising pitch this week. Mr. Ryan is on the ticket to ''inspire ultraconservative ideologues and corporate interests,'' he said, adding, ''that means tens or even hundreds of millions more dollars for the Romney campaign and the array of outside groups supporting him.''
The money, he said, would pay for attack ads. ''Those ads will have more impact on undecided voters than anything Paul Ryan himself does or says,'' Mr. Messina wrote, making his own appeal for donations to take countermeasures.

HEADLINE: Home Depot Sales Perk Up In Markets Hit the Hardest

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
ATLANTA (AP) -- Home Depot is feeling more optimistic about the recovery of the housing market after customers spent more on sprucing up their homes in the second quarter.The retailer said on Tuesday that strong cost controls and healthy sales of paint, bathroom accessories and kitchen installations helped lift its net income by 12.4 percent during the period. 
The Atlanta-based company increased its full-year outlook, citing its performance in the first half.
In a conference call with investors, Home Depot's chairman and chief executive, Frank Blake, noted that some of the strongest growth in the latest quarter came from the markets that were hit hardest in the downturn, like California and Florida.
''These are encouraging signs of stabilization in the housing market,'' Mr. Blake said.
He also noted that the housing market was now a contributor to the country's gross domestic product, rather than a drag. Another positive sign for Home Depot was the Commerce Department announcement Tuesday that Americans increased their retail spending in July for the first time in four months, as spending increased on furniture and building materials, among other items.
Still, the housing market is a long way from returning to its heyday before the recession. Home Depot's sales in the quarter rose just 2 percent from a year earlier. And although the company lifted its earnings forecast for the year, it did not update its outlook that sales for the year would grow by 4.6 percent.
For the quarter that ended July 29, Home Depot earned $1.53 billion, or $1.01 a share, compared with $1.36 billion, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results topped the earnings of 97 cents a share that analysts polled by FactSet expected.
Revenue climbed to $20.57 billion from $20.23 billion. But Wall Street expected higher revenue of $20.74 billion.
Over all, revenue at stores open at least a year rose 2.1 percent, which was slower than the 4.3 percent growth last year. The company noted that the warm winter pulled sales of many seasonal items, like gardening products, into the first quarter.
In the United States, where most of Home Depot's stores are, the figure rose 2.6 percent. The metric is a key gauge of a retailer's health because it strips out the impact of recently opened or closed locations.
Looking ahead, Home Depot now expects fiscal 2012 earnings of $2.95 a share, up from the $2.90 a share it previously forecast. Revenue is still expected to rise 4.6 percent, implying $73.63 billion.
Analysts had been expecting earnings of $2.92 a share on revenue of $73.95 billion.

HEADLINE: Ex-Premier Says Syrian Government Is Falling Apart

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE and DALAL MAWAD; Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Antakya, Turkey, and Rick Gladstone from New York.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Syria's former prime minister, who fled the country last week, said on Tuesday in his first public appearance since his defection that the government of President Bashar al-Assad was crumbling internally under the pressure of relentless fighting against rebels, and from betrayals by loyalists who want only to flee.''Based on my experience and my position, the regime is falling apart morally, materially, economically,'' the former official, Riyad Farid Hijab, said at a news conference in Amman, Jordan. ''Its military is rusting, and it only controls 30 percent of Syria's territory.''
He added that many high-level civilian and military officials in Syria -- ''leaders with dignity'' -- were waiting to defect. And he urged the opposition to unify and move ahead with plans for a transitional government and ''a civilian democratic state that preserves the right, justice and dignity of all Syrians.'' 
But he said he had no interest in a formal position with a post-Assad government, should there be one. ''I have sacrificed myself in the campaign of righteousness,'' he said. ''I don't want to satisfy anyone but God.''
Mr. Hijab's repudiation of the Assad government was welcomed in Washington, where the Treasury Department removed his name from a blacklist of high Syrian officials whose assets have been frozen by American sanctions. In a statement announcing Mr. Hijab's removal from the blacklist, the Treasury Department said it hoped that other Syrian officials would take ''similarly courageous steps to reject the Assad regime and stand with the Syrian people.''
Mr. Hijab explained his defection as a response to the government's threats against his family, and to his conclusion that the Assad government had no reasonable means to end the violence.
His claims about the weakness of the Assad government could not be independently verified, and he gave few details to support his harsh assessment. Mr. Hijab, a Sunni technocrat from the eastern city of Deir al-Zour -- which has been enduring shelling and fighting for weeks -- was not a member of Mr. Assad's inner circle, and he was appointed to the position of prime minister only in June.
But analysts have said that as the highest-level civilian official to defect, he may have had access to reliable internal assessments or government sources. His argument that the government is weakening follows similar descriptions from other defectors, who have suggested that Mr. Assad's grip on power has been loosening even as Syria increasingly becomes the arena for a proxy war, with Iran and Russia assisting the government as Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia funnel military aid to the rebels, supplemented with nonlethal assistance from the United States.
The Obama administration has resisted an intensified clamor by Syrian insurgents for military help from the United States, including ammunition and the imposition of a no-fly zone in Syria to deter the Syrian air force from bombing rebel targets. While the administration has not ruled out any option on Syria, American officials have repeatedly said they do not want to further militarize the conflict. Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta reiterated that view in an interview on Monday with The Associated Press, asserting that plans for a no-fly zone in Syria were ''not on the front burner as far as I know.''
In Aleppo, where communications seemed to be limited, fighting continued Tuesday, with the rebels saying they were trying to hold contested areas amid an extended government assault.
In and around Damascus, activists reported heavy shelling and growing numbers of refugees flowing out of the city. One activist reported that in the suburb of Qudsaya, dozens of shells landed in a single hour, destroying homes and injuring residents.
In the city, heavy clashes were reported in the neighborhood of Tadamon, a rebel-controlled area that abuts Yarmouk, Syria's largest Palestinian neighborhood, and in an area called Qabbon, where sectarian fighting between Alawites and Sunnis appeared to have caused a mass exodus.
''A cycle of endless violence seems to have been set off,'' said an activist in Damascus who declined to give his name. ''Everyone I know in Qabbon has said they are fleeing before 'we get slaughtered.' That's what they told me.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Bloomberg's Immigration Road Trip

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg took his pro-immigration views on the road on Tuesday to public forums in Chicago and Boston, where he urged President Obama and Mitt Romney to make immigration a central issue in the presidential campaign.Mr. Bloomberg, never shy about pressing his priorities on others, deserves credit for hammering on this one. At a time when politicians try to outdo one another for harshness on immigration, he was pushing another approach -- one that is more generous with visas and puts the 11 million or so illegal immigrants in the United States on a path to citizenship for the sake of national prosperity. 
''There is no way to help the economy as quickly and as cost-free as opening the borders to create jobs and create business,'' he said in Chicago. He has often called the alternative -- tighter immigration restrictions and mass deportation -- a form of ''national suicide.''
The mayor said that for all the rancor surrounding immigration, it remained one of the few issues where bipartisan agreement was possible -- a point shown by the two partners who joined him on Tuesday: Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive of the News Corporation; and William Daley, the former chief of staff to Mr. Obama.
Mr. Bloomberg is pushing a four-point reform plan: giving green cards to foreigners who earn graduate degrees in the United States in science, technology, engineering and math; increasing the percentage of visas based on economic need; creating a special visa for entrepreneurs; and devising a guest-worker program for seasonal and labor-intensive industries. Mr. Bloomberg chided both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney for offering nothing ''more than lip service'' about immigration and the economy. But while Mr. Obama has often been disappointing as an immigration advocate, Mr. Romney and his party have been colossal failures.
After a long period of vagueness, Mr. Romney moved in the primary to embrace the extremist notion that illegal immigrants should be made so miserable that they deport themselves. By contrast, Mr. Obama has endorsed the sensible reforms that Mr. Bloomberg is seeking.
The kind of guest-worker reform Mr. Bloomberg wants has languished in Congress for more than a decade, stymied by Republican opposition. Likewise, a bill to legalize young immigrants who go to college or serve in the military has been blocked by Republicans; Mr. Romney vowed to veto it should it ever pass. (Mr. Obama is achieving the bill's goals through executive action.) When Mr. Bloomberg talks about bringing common sense to the immigration debate, it's Mr. Romney and his fellow Republicans who most need to listen.

HEADLINE: On The Trail: A Metaphor Draws Notice

BYLINE: By REBECCA BERG

 BODY:
9:43 p.m. | Updated Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. created a stir Tuesday at a campaign speech in Virginia when he told the crowd that Mitt Romney's policies would enable the banking and financial sectors to "put you all back in chains."The remark came roughly two-thirds of the way through Mr. Biden's 30-minute speech, which was delivered to a crowd that included many African-Americans at the Institute for Advanced Learning and Research in Danville, Va.
"Romney wants to let the - he said in the first hundred days, he's going to let the big banks once again write their own rules, unchain Wall Street," Mr. Biden said. "They're going to put you all back in chains." 
On a C-Span video of the speech, the audience does not appear to react negatively to Mr. Biden's phrasing; indeed, laughter can be heard among the crowd.
President Obama and his surrogates have been campaigning heavily in Virginia, and the campaign's strategy relies in part on energizing the black vote to take the traditionally Republican state, which moved to the Democratic column in the 2008 presidential election. According to the Census, the population of Danville is roughly 48.8 percent white and 48.6 percent black.
After Mr. Biden's address, some Republicans assailed Mr. Biden's remark. On Twitter, Ari Fleischer, a former press secretary for President George W. Bush, likened the comment to one made by Sarah Palin when she compared critical press coverage to "blood libel," a term alluding to the false allegation that Jews once killed Christian children to use their blood for religious rituals.
"The press pounded Palin when she talked about 'blood libel,'" Mr. Fleischer wrote. "What will they do about Biden's 'chains' remark?"
Later Tuesday, both presidential campaigns responded to the vice president's remarks, with Mr. Romney's campaign calling the phrasing "not acceptable."
"After weeks of slanderous and baseless accusations leveled against Governor Romney, the Obama campaign has reached a new low," Andrea Saul, Mr. Romney's press secretary, said in a statement. "The comments made by the vice president of the United States are not acceptable in our political discourse and demonstrate yet again that the Obama campaign will say and do anything to win this election. President Obama should tell the American people whether he agrees with Joe Biden's comments."
In a statement, Stephanie Cutter, Mr. Obama's deputy campaign manager, defended Mr. Biden.
"For months, Speaker Boehner, Congressman Ryan and other Republicans have called for the 'unshackling' of the private sector from regulations that protect Americans from risky financial deals and other reckless behavior that crashed our economy. Since then, the vice president has often used a similar metaphor to describe the need to 'unshackle' the middle class. Today's comments were a derivative of those remarks, describing the devastating impact letting Wall Street write its own rules again would have on middle class families. We find the Romney campaign's outrage over the vice president's comments today hypocritical, particularly in light of their own candidate's stump speech questioning the president's patriotism. Now, let's return to that 'substantive' debate Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan promised 72 hours ago, but quickly abandoned."
As he concluded his speech, Mr. Biden confused North Carolina with Virginia, where Danville is located.
"With you we can win North Carolina again, and if we do, we win the election if we win you," Mr. Biden said.
The city of Danville abuts the northern border of North Carolina, which also went for Mr. Obama in 2008 but is considered a more challenging state for his campaign this time around.
At a second appearance on Tuesday, in Wytheville, Va., Mr. Biden said his remarks had merely alluded to a term used previously by Republicans, including Mr. Romney's running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan. In his response to Mr. Obama's State of the Union address in 2011, Mr. Ryan said, "We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people, of every background, to succeed and prosper."
"And I'm told that when I made that comment earlier today in Danville, Va., the Romney campaign put out a tweet," Mr. Biden told the crowd in Wytheville. "You know, tweets these days? Put out a tweet, went on the airwaves saying, 'Biden, he's outrageous in saying that,' I think I said instead of 'unshackled,' 'unchained.' 'Outrageous to say that.' That's what we had. I'm using their own words."
"I got a message for them," Mr. Biden continued. "If you want to know what's outrageous, it's their policies and the effects of their policies on middle-class America. That's what's outrageous."
Mr. Romney addressed Mr. Biden's original remark in a speech Tuesday evening in Chillicothe, Ohio, calling it an indicator that Mr. Obama's presidency had become "angry and desperate," according to The Associated Press.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Giant Hospital Chain Is Blazing a Profit Trail

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and REED ABELSON; Griff Palmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
During the Great Recession, when many hospitals across the country were nearly brought to their knees by growing numbers of uninsured patients, one hospital system not only survived -- it thrived.In fact, profits at the health care industry giant HCA, which controls 163 hospitals from New Hampshire to California, have soared, far outpacing those of most of its competitors.
The big winners have been three private equity firms -- including Bain Capital, co-founded by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate -- that bought HCA in late 2006.
HCA's robust profit growth has raised the value of the firms' holdings to nearly three and a half times their initial investment in the $33 billion deal. 
The financial performance has been so impressive that HCA has become a model for the industry. Its success inspired 35 buyouts of hospitals or chains of facilities in the last two and a half years by private equity firms eager to repeat that windfall.
HCA's emergence as a powerful leader in the hospital industry is all the more remarkable because only a decade ago the company was badly shaken by a wide-ranging Medicare fraud investigation that it eventually settled for more than $1.7 billion.
Among the secrets to HCA's success: It figured out how to get more revenue from private insurance companies, patients and Medicare by billing much more aggressively for its services than ever before; it found ways to reduce emergency room overcrowding and expenses; and it experimented with new ways to reduce the cost of its medical staff, a move that sometimes led to conflicts with doctors and nurses over concerns about patient care.
In late 2008, for instance, HCA changed the billing codes it assigned to sick and injured patients who came into the emergency rooms. Almost overnight, the numbers of patients who HCA said needed more care, which would be paid for at significantly higher levels by Medicare, surged.
HCA, which had lagged the industry for those high-paying categories, jumped ahead of its competitors and was reimbursed accordingly. The change, which HCA's executives said better reflected the service being provided, increased operating earnings by nearly $100 million in the first quarter of 2009.
To some, HCA successfully pushed the envelope in its interpretation of existing Medicare rules. ''If HCA can do it, why can't we?'' asked a hospital consulting firm, the Advisory Board Company, in a presentation to its clients.
In one instance, HCA executives said a private insurer, which it declined to name, questioned the new billing system, forcing it to return some of the money it had collected.
The hospital giant also adopted a policy meant to address an issue that bedevils hospitals nationwide -- reducing costs and overcrowding in its emergency rooms. For years, the hospital emergency room has been used by the uninsured as a de facto doctor's office -- a place for even the most minor of ailments. But emergency care is expensive and has become increasingly burdensome to hospitals in the last decade because of the rising number of uninsured patients.
HCA decided not to treat patients who came in with nonurgent conditions, like a cold or the flu or even a sprained wrist, unless those patients paid in advance. In a recent statement, HCA said that of the six million patients treated in its emergency rooms last year, 80,000, or about 1.3 percent, '' chose to seek alternative care options.''
''Many E.R.'s in America, particularly in densely populated urban areas where most HCA-affiliated facilities are located, have adopted a variety of systems to determine whether a patient in fact needs emergency care,'' the statement said. ''About half our hospitals have done so. Typically, our affiliated hospitals have two caregivers -- usually a triage nurse and a physician -- make that determination. It should be noted that other non-HCA affiliated hospitals are using similar processes to address E.R. issues.''
As HCA's profits and influence grew, strains arose with doctors and nurses over whether the chain's pursuit of profit may have, at times, come at the expense of patient care.
HCA had put in place a flexible staffing system that allowed it to estimate the number of patients it would have each day in its hospitals and alter the number of nurses it needed accordingly.
Several nurses interviewed said they were concerned that the system sometimes had led to inadequate staffing in important areas like critical care. In one measure of adequate staffing -- the prevalence of bedsores in patients bedridden for long periods of time -- HCA clearly struggled. Some of its hospitals fended off lawsuits over the problem in recent years, and were admonished by regulators over staffing issues more than once.
'Through the Roof'
Many doctors interviewed at various HCA facilities said they had felt increased pressure to focus on profits under the private equity ownership. ''Their profits are going through the roof, but, unfortunately, it's occurring at the expense of patients,'' said Dr. Abraham Awwad, a kidney specialist in St. Petersburg, Fla., whose complaints over the safety of the dialysis programs at two HCA-owned hospitals prompted state investigations.
One facility was fined $8,000 in 2008 and $14,000 last year for delaying the start of dialysis in patients, not administering physician-prescribed drugs and not documenting whether ordered tests had been performed.
Claiming he provided poor care, the other hospital did not renew Dr. Awwad's privileges. Dr. Awwad is suing to have them reinstated. HCA declined to comment. HCA says it stands by its procedures, billing practices and level of care.
HCA says that more than 80 percent of its hospitals ranked among the top 10 percent in the country for federal quality measures, compared with 13 percent in 2006 when it went private. Last year, the company provided a $2.68 billion provision for charity care. And under the control of its private equity owners, HCA has invested around $8 billion in its hospitals in the last five years, according to Securities and Exchange Commission findings.
''You must know that we firmly believe that there is no sustainable business model as a health care delivery system that does not have at its core the provision of high-quality patient care and services,'' HCA's chief executive, Richard M. Bracken, wrote in an e-mail to The New York Times last year. Achieving a balance between profit and care is harder for investor-owned hospitals like HCA than for others, some experts say. ''If you were a for-profit hospital with investors and shareholders,'' said Paul Levy, a former nonprofit hospital executive in Boston unaffiliated with HCA, ''there would be a natural tendency to be more aggressive and to seek more revenues.'' Executives at profit-making hospitals are ''judged in greater measure by profitability'' than the administrators of nonprofit hospitals, he said.
Profit-making systems like HCA are often in a better position to invest in improving their hospitals and taking advantage of the latest in new technology. Their sheer size often allows them to negotiate lower prices for everything from X-ray machines to pharmaceuticals, which can, in theory at least, be passed onto consumers.
But some of HCA's tactics are now under scrutiny by the Justice Department. Last week, HCA disclosed that the United States attorney's office in Miami has requested information about cardiac procedures at 10 of its hospitals in Florida and elsewhere.
HCA's cardiac business is extremely lucrative, and the Justice Department has requested reviews that HCA conducted that indicate some of the heart procedures at some of its hospitals might not have been necessary and resulted in unjustified reimbursements from Medicare and other insurers.
To analyze HCA's business model, The Times examined federal and state hospital records, lawsuits and regulatory investigations, and interviewed dozens of current and former doctors, nurses and administrators. It also carried out an extensive data analysis based on statistics from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration and the American Hospital Directory, a private company that processes and resells federal health care data.
The story of HCA's growth offers a window on the changing world of health care. Small and nonprofit hospitals are closing or being gobbled up by medical conglomerates, many of which operate for a profit and therefore try to increase revenue and reduce costs even as they improve patient care. The trend toward consolidation is likely to accelerate under the Obama administration's health care law as hospitals grapple with what are expected to be lower reimbursements from the federal and state governments and private insurers.
HCA has a dynamic history and powerful political ties. It was co-founded in 1968 by members of the Tennessee family of Dr. Thomas Frist Sr., the father of the former Republican senator, William Frist, also a doctor.
Its boom years were in the mid-1990s when the hospital system, then called HCA-Hospital Corporation of America, merged with the Columbia Healthcare Corporation, a hospital group led by Rick Scott, now governor of Florida.
Columbia/HCA became the target of a widespread fraud investigation in the late 1990s, which led to one of the largest Medicare settlements ever. Mr. Scott was removed as chief executive by the board, but was never accused by regulators of wrongdoing.
After years of rebuilding, HCA's earnings began to weaken in early 2006 as admissions for operations at its hospitals tumbled, according to documents filed with the S.E.C. The weaker earnings in turn drove down the stock of the publicly traded company.
That spring, a group of investment bankers from Merrill Lynch approached top HCA executives to discuss a buyout by private equity firms.
The Merrill bankers found a receptive audience. Thomas F. Frist Jr., a board member, co-founder and brother of Senator Frist, had been a longtime investor in Bain Capital's buyout funds and contacted the firm to gauge its interest in acquiring HCA through a leveraged buyout and taking it private again, according to S.E.C. documents. A leveraged buyout is an acquisition of a company that is done with large amounts of borrowed money.
Other executives contacted Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, and the Merrill bankers brought the firm's own private equity team to invest in the deal, according to S.E.C. documents.
That July, HCA said it was being acquired in a deal valued at $33 billion.
The buyout came with risks. The new owners, who now occupied the majority of seats on HCA's board, contributed only about $1.2 billion apiece in equity outlay from funds they oversaw, borrowing around $16 billion and assuming $11.7 billion of HCA's outstanding debt. The deal essentially doubled the amount of debt held by HCA hospitals to $26 billion by borrowing from banks and selling bonds.
The Frist family also invested, as did other Wall Street banks. Among the new owners were top managers, including Jack O. Bovender Jr., then HCA's chief, and its president, Mr. Bracken, who became chief executive in January 2009.
In 2010, buoyed by robust growth in profit, HCA was able to issue billions of dollars in debt that was used to pay funds overseen by the three buyout firms nearly $1 billion in dividends -- each. In the spring of 2011, in one of the most closely watched public offerings since the financial crisis, HCA became a public company once again. Its three buyout owners each sold another $500 million worth of stock, allowing them to recoup all their initial investment.
Last fall, HCA agreed to buy back the stake held by Bank of America, which had purchased Merrill Lynch in 2009, for $1.5 billion, giving the bank a return of two and a half times its initial investment. And earlier this year, HCA paid out $900 million in dividends, of which $360 million went to K.K.R. and Bain.
The 40 percent stake in HCA still held by K.K.R. and Bain is worth about $4.8 billion at current levels, giving them a potential profit, with the dividends they have received, of three and a half times their initial investment of $1.2 billion each.
Those returns caught the attention of other buyout firms. In 2010, Steward Health Care System, controlled by Cerberus Capital Management and based in Boston, bought the second-largest hospital group in Massachusetts, converting it to a profit-making system. That same year, Vanguard Health Systems, which is run for profit and still has Blackstone Group as its largest shareholder after going public in 2011, bought eight hospitals in Detroit.
HCA itself continues to grow, buying up hospitals and doctor groups across the country. Large hospitals ''will be best positioned to deal with forthcoming changes. Size and scale definitely provides an advantage in terms of lowering our cost structure and sharing best practices,'' said HCA's chief executive, Mr. Bracken. All of which, he added, were ''essential ingredients for success.''
Redefining Emergency Care
Several years ago, digital billboards began popping up along highways throughout Florida, featuring the image of a painter falling from a ladder and the message, ''Accidents happen fast. Emergency care should too.'' Like highway signs that list the travel times to various destinations, the billboards flashed in real time the emergency room wait times -- 17 minutes, for example, or 45 minutes -- at nearby HCA hospitals.
HCA wanted to attract more patients to its emergency rooms, and it did. Annual visits climbed 20 percent from 2007 to 2011.
But while emergency departments are often a critical source of patient admissions, they are frequently money-losers because many patients do not have insurance. HCA found a solution: it figured out how to be paid more for the patients it was seeing.
All hospitals use a system of codes to bill services to Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers. The codes, which require some subjective evaluation, are supposed to reflect how much care is being delivered. Hospitals can differ over which treatments require which codes. A patient who walks into the emergency room with a simple case of indigestion would be classified by the hospital as using very little of its resources. The hospital would be reimbursed just $50 by Medicare for its evaluation.
A patient who might be suffering a heart attack might require oxygen, be placed on a cardiac monitor and transported for a CT scan. The hospital would classify those services at the highest level, earning it a $323 reimbursement from Medicare.
At HCA in 2006, slightly more than a quarter of the payments it received from Medicare were for patients classified in the two highest-paying categories, far behind the 58 percent reported at other hospitals, according to an analysis of Medicare payments by The Times, using data provided by the American Hospital Directory.
During that time, HCA was still operating under a corporate integrity agreement resulting from its Medicare fraud settlement, and an independent reviewer was scrutinizing its billing.
By late 2008, however, just as the agreement with federal regulators was ending, HCA introduced a new coding system for its emergency rooms. HCA said the system, based on a method developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians, was less complicated and better captured the time and resources used by the hospital.
Nearly overnight, HCA's patients appeared to be much, much sicker. By 2010, HCA had surpassed other hospitals, with 76 percent of its payments coming from the two most expensive classifications, versus 74 percent for other hospitals.
For individual HCA hospitals, the change made a big difference. At Riverside Community Hospital in California, Medicare reimbursements for the highest classifications surged to $949,000 in 2010, from $48,000 in 2006. Likewise, at Kendall Regional Medical Center in Miami, Medicare payments jumped to $1.5 million from $69,000. In a conference call in early 2009 with Wall Street analysts, HCA's executives said that the change in the billing system had increased the company's adjusted earnings by about 7 percent, or $75 million to $100 million, in a single quarter.
Behind the scenes, however, HCA executives said they realized the new system was causing too many of its patients to land in the highest-paying categories. HCA's head of ethics and compliance, Alan R. Yuspeh, said in a telephone interview last year that the company had identified the problem shortly after introducing the system and changed it to bring the company in line with the national average.
Still, HCA reported similar results in the next quarter.
Medicare has not provided hospitals with clear guidance about what kind of coding system they should use, and Mr. Yuspeh said HCA had alerted the agency to its use of the new system. No one has accused HCA of up-coding, or billing for more expensive services that were not needed -- one of the complaints made against it a decade ago.
Vicki Bryan at the research firm GimmeCredit began warning HCA's bondholders who subscribe to her reports in the spring of 2009 that HCA's model was bolstering short-term returns, but that the system could have potentially negative long-term consequences if Medicare balked and demanded reimbursements.
So far there is no indication Medicare has done so, and a spokeswoman declined to comment. The acting head of Medicare is Marilyn B. Tavenner, a former HCA executive who left there in 2005 to become the secretary of Health and Human Resources in Virginia.
Turning Away Patients
Changing billing codes wasn't the only avenue HCA pursued in search of higher profits.
Like many hospitals, HCA said its emergency rooms were overcrowded with patients who had minor illnesses like the flu rather than emergencies that it was obligated under federal law to treat. The company was among the first hospital systems to impose a protocol to reduce the number of patients it treated who did not seem to have a true medical emergency and were either unwilling or unable to pay.
Patients whose ailments were not deemed urgent were told to go somewhere else, like a free clinic, or that they could be treated if they paid the co-payment for their insurance or around $150 in cash.
Several former emergency department doctors at Lawnwood Regional Medical Center in Fort Pierce, Fla., said they frequently had felt compelled to override the screening system in order to treat patients.
One doctor, who asked not to be identified because he still works as an emergency physician, recalled one episode in which he was told to turn away a young boy with a deep cut in his arm because it was not bleeding profusely and he therefore did not meet the criteria.
''Physicians had a really, really hard time with it,'' said Dr. J. Patrick Pearsall, who worked for an emergency physician group based in Houston that worked in HCA hospitals. When the doctors failed to meet the hospital's goals for how many patients should be considered emergencies, ''they really started putting pressure on.''
One emergency room doctor who worked at an HCA Florida hospital said doctors had been told they had targets to hit. The doctors' concerns about the screening policy were acknowledged in an e-mail reviewed by The Times that was sent to the doctors at the hospital in early 2008 by an outside company that worked in the emergency room.
The doctors were told HCA's regional executives were ''quite intent on pursuing this program at least for the time being and fully expects us to comply. Their expectations are that approximately 15 percent of all patients are to be screened and of those screened no more than 35 percent overridden.''
Regulators in several states have taken HCA hospitals to task over screening out patients too aggressively, including situations where the screening missed serious conditions.
In early 2010, an uninsured patient who entered HCA's TriStar Skyline Medical Center in Nashville, complaining of ''pain when breathing,'' was sent away. An hour and a half later, at another hospital, the same patient was found to have pneumonia, according to the results of a Medicare investigation. Regulators cited Skyline for having ''failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was conducted.''
This year, the Office of Inspector General fined HCA's Northside Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla., $38,000 for sending home a feverish patient with an artificial heart valve. Two days later, the patient reappeared with the flu and severe respiratory problems. The following day, he died.
HCA officials say they instituted the screening system to reduce overcrowding in emergency rooms. The company said its hospitals were providing quality care to patients and attended to any patients with medical emergencies, fulfilling their obligations under federal law. ''Our E.R.'s are designed to offer access to everyone who needs emergency care,'' the company said in a statement this year. And HCA says it never instituted quotas.
Still, some executives at other hospitals say HCA's screening process is troubling. ''From a business perspective, if you're in Nashville, you're high-fiving each other,'' said John Couris, chief executive of Jupiter Medical, a rival Florida hospital. ''But from a public policy perspective, it's the wrong thing to do.''
Bedsores are ugly, painful wounds that can easily become infected and lead to dangerous complications for patients in hospitals.
Bedsores are also fairly easy to prevent. If nurses check patients regularly and turn them or, in certain cases, put patients on air mattresses that redistribute pressure, many bedsores can be prevented or treated early.
A Matter of Staff Levels
Experts say there is often a direct correlation between bedsores and the quality of hospital staff levels. ''Staffing is critical,'' said Courtney H. Lyder, the dean at the UCLA School of Nursing and an expert on wound care. ''When you see high levels of wounds, you usually see a high level of dysfunctional staff,'' he said.
HCA owned eight of the 15 worst hospitals for bedsores among 545 profit-making hospitals nationwide, each with more than 1,000 patient discharges, tracked by the Sunlight Foundation using Medicare data from October 2008 to June 2010. HCA's West Houston Medical Center and CJW Medical Center in Richmond, Va., landed near the top of the list.
HCA says it has increased its nursing staff at its hospitals each year over the last five years. But an examination of lawsuits shows bedsore problems have been persistent at several HCA facilities. In Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire, a 60-year-old woman died in 2009 after her bedsores went untreated for three days and became infected, according to a wrongful-death lawsuit filed in the spring of 2011 in federal court against the hospital. HCA denied the claims in court documents.
And bedsores were partly responsible for forever altering the life of George Clay Chandler, a lieutenant in the Clay County sheriff's office in north Florida. Five years ago, Mr. Chandler decided to undergo weight-loss surgery. A mountain of a man at 6-foot-1 and 375 pounds, Mr. Chandler entered Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville for what seemed like a relatively simple operation.
But when Mr. Chandler emerged two months later, he was a changed man. He was unable to speak. His eyes were badly damaged, his limbs contorted, and he suffered from a large, painful bedsore on his buttock.
While some of Mr. Chandler's injuries occurred at the hands of an inexperienced surgeon, according to a lawsuit in a county court, many more developed while he lay, virtually unattended, in the hospital's critical care unit. One nurse, who quit Memorial after repeatedly warning executives about what she saw as a shortage of qualified nurses on staff, testified that Mr. Chandler's bedsores could have been easily prevented.
Memorial was the focus of six civil lawsuits by former patients who claimed, among other things, that they had received poor care and suffered bedsores. Five of those lawsuits were settled for undisclosed sums.
The hospital was cited twice by Florida regulators, in 2008 and 2010, for having inadequate numbers of nurses on its staff to oversee wound care for patients. During the 2010 examination, regulators noted that Memorial had less than the equivalent of two full-time nurses who specialized in wound care to treat the 132 patients who required aid.
''The system of treatment for wound care places patients at risk for additional medical complications,'' the examiners said.
The hospital said it had taken corrective measures in response to the shortfalls cited by Florida regulators.
HCA says its hospitals have improved and, citing its own internal analysis, says its rate of bedsores is now below the national average. ''We recognize some hospitals within our company are achieving better results than others, and this provides opportunities to learn from our top performers and apply those lessons broadly,'' the company said in a statement last year.
Earlier this year, a jury awarded Mr. Chandler and his family $178 million in damages. This month, Memorial and HCA, which had appealed the jury's verdict, reached a confidential settlement with Mr. Chandler's family.

HEADLINE: A Giant Hospital Chain Is Blazing a Profit Trail

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and REED ABELSON; Griff Palmer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
During the Great Recession, when many hospitals across the country were nearly brought to their knees by growing numbers of uninsured patients, one hospital system not only survived -- it thrived.In fact, profits at the health care industry giant HCA, which controls 163 hospitals from New Hampshire to California, have soared, far outpacing those of most of its competitors.
The big winners have been three private equity firms -- including Bain Capital, co-founded by Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate -- that bought HCA in late 2006.
HCA's robust profit growth has raised the value of the firms' holdings to nearly three and a half times their initial investment in the $33 billion deal. 
The financial performance has been so impressive that HCA has become a model for the industry. Its success inspired 35 buyouts of hospitals or chains of facilities in the last two and a half years by private equity firms eager to repeat that windfall.
HCA's emergence as a powerful leader in the hospital industry is all the more remarkable because only a decade ago the company was badly shaken by a wide-ranging Medicare fraud investigation that it eventually settled for more than $1.7 billion.
Among the secrets to HCA's success: It figured out how to get more revenue from private insurance companies, patients and Medicare by billing much more aggressively for its services than ever before; it found ways to reduce emergency room overcrowding and expenses; and it experimented with new ways to reduce the cost of its medical staff, a move that sometimes led to conflicts with doctors and nurses over concerns about patient care.
In late 2008, for instance, HCA changed the billing codes it assigned to sick and injured patients who came into the emergency rooms. Almost overnight, the numbers of patients who HCA said needed more care, which would be paid for at significantly higher levels by Medicare, surged.
HCA, which had lagged the industry for those high-paying categories, jumped ahead of its competitors and was reimbursed accordingly. The change, which HCA's executives said better reflected the service being provided, increased operating earnings by nearly $100 million in the first quarter of 2009.
To some, HCA successfully pushed the envelope in its interpretation of existing Medicare rules. ''If HCA can do it, why can't we?'' asked a hospital consulting firm, the Advisory Board Company, in a presentation to its clients.
In one instance, HCA executives said a private insurer, which it declined to name, questioned the new billing system, forcing it to return some of the money it had collected.
The hospital giant also adopted a policy meant to address an issue that bedevils hospitals nationwide -- reducing costs and overcrowding in its emergency rooms. For years, the hospital emergency room has been used by the uninsured as a de facto doctor's office -- a place for even the most minor of ailments. But emergency care is expensive and has become increasingly burdensome to hospitals in the last decade because of the rising number of uninsured patients.
HCA decided not to treat patients who came in with nonurgent conditions, like a cold or the flu or even a sprained wrist, unless those patients paid in advance. In a recent statement, HCA said that of the six million patients treated in its emergency rooms last year, 80,000, or about 1.3 percent, '' chose to seek alternative care options.''
''Many E.R.'s in America, particularly in densely populated urban areas where most HCA-affiliated facilities are located, have adopted a variety of systems to determine whether a patient in fact needs emergency care,'' the statement said. ''About half our hospitals have done so. Typically, our affiliated hospitals have two caregivers -- usually a triage nurse and a physician -- make that determination. It should be noted that other non-HCA affiliated hospitals are using similar processes to address E.R. issues.''
As HCA's profits and influence grew, strains arose with doctors and nurses over whether the chain's pursuit of profit may have, at times, come at the expense of patient care.
HCA had put in place a flexible staffing system that allowed it to estimate the number of patients it would have each day in its hospitals and alter the number of nurses it needed accordingly.
Several nurses interviewed said they were concerned that the system sometimes had led to inadequate staffing in important areas like critical care. In one measure of adequate staffing -- the prevalence of bedsores in patients bedridden for long periods of time -- HCA clearly struggled. Some of its hospitals fended off lawsuits over the problem in recent years, and were admonished by regulators over staffing issues more than once.
'Through the Roof'
Many doctors interviewed at various HCA facilities said they had felt increased pressure to focus on profits under the private equity ownership. ''Their profits are going through the roof, but, unfortunately, it's occurring at the expense of patients,'' said Dr. Abraham Awwad, a kidney specialist in St. Petersburg, Fla., whose complaints over the safety of the dialysis programs at two HCA-owned hospitals prompted state investigations.
One facility was fined $8,000 in 2008 and $14,000 last year for delaying the start of dialysis in patients, not administering physician-prescribed drugs and not documenting whether ordered tests had been performed.
Claiming he provided poor care, the other hospital did not renew Dr. Awwad's privileges. Dr. Awwad is suing to have them reinstated. HCA declined to comment. HCA says it stands by its procedures, billing practices and level of care.
HCA says that more than 80 percent of its hospitals ranked among the top 10 percent in the country for federal quality measures, compared with 13 percent in 2006 when it went private. Last year, the company provided a $2.68 billion provision for charity care. And under the control of its private equity owners, HCA has invested around $8 billion in its hospitals in the last five years, according to Securities and Exchange Commission findings.
''You must know that we firmly believe that there is no sustainable business model as a health care delivery system that does not have at its core the provision of high-quality patient care and services,'' HCA's chief executive, Richard M. Bracken, wrote in an e-mail to The New York Times last year. Achieving a balance between profit and care is harder for investor-owned hospitals like HCA than for others, some experts say. ''If you were a for-profit hospital with investors and shareholders,'' said Paul Levy, a former nonprofit hospital executive in Boston unaffiliated with HCA, ''there would be a natural tendency to be more aggressive and to seek more revenues.'' Executives at profit-making hospitals are ''judged in greater measure by profitability'' than the administrators of nonprofit hospitals, he said.
Profit-making systems like HCA are often in a better position to invest in improving their hospitals and taking advantage of the latest in new technology. Their sheer size often allows them to negotiate lower prices for everything from X-ray machines to pharmaceuticals, which can, in theory at least, be passed onto consumers.
But some of HCA's tactics are now under scrutiny by the Justice Department. Last week, HCA disclosed that the United States attorney's office in Miami has requested information about cardiac procedures at 10 of its hospitals in Florida and elsewhere.
HCA's cardiac business is extremely lucrative, and the Justice Department has requested reviews that HCA conducted that indicate some of the heart procedures at some of its hospitals might not have been necessary and resulted in unjustified reimbursements from Medicare and other insurers.
To analyze HCA's business model, The Times examined federal and state hospital records, lawsuits and regulatory investigations, and interviewed dozens of current and former doctors, nurses and administrators. It also carried out an extensive data analysis based on statistics from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration and the American Hospital Directory, a private company that processes and resells federal health care data.

Redefining Emergency Care
Several years ago, digital billboards began popping up along highways throughout Florida, featuring the image of a painter falling from a ladder and the message, ''Accidents happen fast. Emergency care should too.'' Like highway signs that list the travel times to various destinations, the billboards flashed in real time the emergency room wait times -- 17 minutes, for example, or 45 minutes -- at nearby HCA hospitals.
HCA wanted to attract more patients to its emergency rooms, and it did. Annual visits climbed 20 percent from 2007 to 2011.
But while emergency departments are often a critical source of patient admissions, they are frequently money-losers because many patients do not have insurance. HCA found a solution: it figured out how to be paid more for the patients it was seeing.
All hospitals use a system of codes to bill services to Medicare, Medicaid and private insurers. The codes, which require some subjective evaluation, are supposed to reflect how much care is being delivered. Hospitals can differ over which treatments require which codes. A patient who walks into the emergency room with a simple case of indigestion would be classified by the hospital as using very little of its resources. The hospital would be reimbursed just $50 by Medicare for its evaluation.
A patient who might be suffering a heart attack might require oxygen, be placed on a cardiac monitor and transported for a CT scan. The hospital would classify those services at the highest level, earning it a $323 reimbursement from Medicare.
At HCA in 2006, slightly more than a quarter of the payments it received from Medicare were for patients classified in the two highest-paying categories, far behind the 58 percent reported at other hospitals, according to an analysis of Medicare payments by The Times, using data provided by the American Hospital Directory.
During that time, HCA was still operating under a corporate integrity agreement resulting from its Medicare fraud settlement, and an independent reviewer was scrutinizing its billing.
By late 2008, however, just as the agreement with federal regulators was ending, HCA introduced a new coding system for its emergency rooms. HCA said the system, based on a method developed by the American College of Emergency Physicians, was less complicated and better captured the time and resources used by the hospital.
Nearly overnight, HCA's patients appeared to be much, much sicker. By 2010, HCA had surpassed other hospitals, with 76 percent of its payments coming from the two most expensive classifications, versus 74 percent for other hospitals.
For individual HCA hospitals, the change made a big difference. At Riverside Community Hospital in California, Medicare reimbursements for the highest classifications surged to $949,000 in 2010, from $48,000 in 2006. Likewise, at Kendall Regional Medical Center in Miami, Medicare payments jumped to $1.5 million from $69,000. In a conference call in early 2009 with Wall Street analysts, HCA's executives said that the change in the billing system had increased the company's adjusted earnings by about 7 percent, or $75 million to $100 million, in a single quarter.
Behind the scenes, however, HCA executives said they realized the new system was causing too many of its patients to land in the highest-paying categories. HCA's head of ethics and compliance, Alan R. Yuspeh, said in a telephone interview last year that the company had identified the problem shortly after introducing the system and changed it to bring the company in line with the national average.
Still, HCA reported similar results in the next quarter.
Medicare has not provided hospitals with clear guidance about what kind of coding system they should use, and Mr. Yuspeh said HCA had alerted the agency to its use of the new system. No one has accused HCA of up-coding, or billing for more expensive services that were not needed -- one of the complaints made against it a decade ago.
Vicki Bryan at the research firm GimmeCredit began warning HCA's bondholders who subscribe to her reports in the spring of 2009 that HCA's model was bolstering short-term returns, but that the system could have potentially negative long-term consequences if Medicare balked and demanded reimbursements.
So far there is no indication Medicare has done so, and a spokeswoman declined to comment. The acting head of Medicare is Marilyn B. Tavenner, a former HCA executive who left there in 2005 to become the secretary of Health and Human Resources in Virginia.
Turning Away Patients
Changing billing codes wasn't the only avenue HCA pursued in search of higher profits.
Like many hospitals, HCA said its emergency rooms were overcrowded with patients who had minor illnesses like the flu rather than emergencies that it was obligated under federal law to treat. The company was among the first hospital systems to impose a protocol to reduce the number of patients it treated who did not seem to have a true medical emergency and were either unwilling or unable to pay.
Patients whose ailments were not deemed urgent were told to go somewhere else, like a free clinic, or that they could be treated if they paid the co-payment for their insurance or around $150 in cash.
Several former emergency department doctors at Lawnwood Regional Medical Center in Fort Pierce, Fla., said they frequently had felt compelled to override the screening system in order to treat patients.
One doctor, who asked not to be identified because he still works as an emergency physician, recalled one episode in which he was told to turn away a young boy with a deep cut in his arm because it was not bleeding profusely and he therefore did not meet the criteria.
''Physicians had a really, really hard time with it,'' said Dr. J. Patrick Pearsall, who worked for an emergency physician group based in Houston that worked in HCA hospitals. When the doctors failed to meet the hospital's goals for how many patients should be considered emergencies, ''they really started putting pressure on.''
One emergency room doctor who worked at an HCA Florida hospital said doctors had been told they had targets to hit. The doctors' concerns about the screening policy were acknowledged in an e-mail reviewed by The Times that was sent to the doctors at the hospital in early 2008 by an outside company that worked in the emergency room.
The doctors were told HCA's regional executives were ''quite intent on pursuing this program at least for the time being and fully expects us to comply. Their expectations are that approximately 15 percent of all patients are to be screened and of those screened no more than 35 percent overridden.''
Regulators in several states have taken HCA hospitals to task over screening out patients too aggressively, including situations where the screening missed serious conditions.
In early 2010, an uninsured patient who entered HCA's TriStar Skyline Medical Center in Nashville, complaining of ''pain when breathing,'' was sent away. An hour and a half later, at another hospital, the same patient was found to have pneumonia, according to the results of a Medicare investigation. Regulators cited Skyline for having ''failed to ensure that an appropriate medical screening examination was conducted.''
This year, the Office of Inspector General fined HCA's Northside Hospital in St. Petersburg, Fla., $38,000 for sending home a feverish patient with an artificial heart valve. Two days later, the patient reappeared with the flu and severe respiratory problems. The following day, he died.
HCA officials say they instituted the screening system to reduce overcrowding in emergency rooms. The company said its hospitals were providing quality care to patients and attended to any patients with medical emergencies, fulfilling their obligations under federal law. ''Our E.R.'s are designed to offer access to everyone who needs emergency care,'' the company said in a statement this year. And HCA says it never instituted quotas.
Still, some executives at other hospitals say HCA's screening process is troubling. ''From a business perspective, if you're in Nashville, you're high-fiving each other,'' said John Couris, chief executive of Jupiter Medical, a rival Florida hospital. ''But from a public policy perspective, it's the wrong thing to do.''
Bedsores are ugly, painful wounds that can easily become infected and lead to dangerous complications for patients in hospitals.
Bedsores are also fairly easy to prevent. If nurses check patients regularly and turn them or, in certain cases, put patients on air mattresses that redistribute pressure, many bedsores can be prevented or treated early.
A Matter of Staff Levels
Experts say there is often a direct correlation between bedsores and the quality of hospital staff levels. ''Staffing is critical,'' said Courtney H. Lyder, the dean at the UCLA School of Nursing and an expert on wound care. ''When you see high levels of wounds, you usually see a high level of dysfunctional staff,'' he said.
HCA owned eight of the 15 worst hospitals for bedsores among 545 profit-making hospitals nationwide, each with more than 1,000 patient discharges, tracked by the Sunlight Foundation using Medicare data from October 2008 to June 2010. HCA's West Houston Medical Center and CJW Medical Center in Richmond, Va., landed near the top of the list.
HCA says it has increased its nursing staff at its hospitals each year over the last five years. But an examination of lawsuits shows bedsore problems have been persistent at several HCA facilities. In Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire, a 60-year-old woman died in 2009 after her bedsores went untreated for three days and became infected, according to a wrongful-death lawsuit filed in the spring of 2011 in federal court against the hospital. HCA denied the claims in court documents.
And bedsores were partly responsible for forever altering the life of George Clay Chandler, a lieutenant in the Clay County sheriff's office in north Florida. Five years ago, Mr. Chandler decided to undergo weight-loss surgery. A mountain of a man at 6-foot-1 and 375 pounds, Mr. Chandler entered Memorial Hospital in Jacksonville for what seemed like a relatively simple operation.
But when Mr. Chandler emerged two months later, he was a changed man. He was unable to speak. His eyes were badly damaged, his limbs contorted, and he suffered from a large, painful bedsore on his buttock.
While some of Mr. Chandler's injuries occurred at the hands of an inexperienced surgeon, according to a lawsuit in a county court, many more developed while he lay, virtually unattended, in the hospital's critical care unit. One nurse, who quit Memorial after repeatedly warning executives about what she saw as a shortage of qualified nurses on staff, testified that Mr. Chandler's bedsores could have been easily prevented.
Memorial was the focus of six civil lawsuits by former patients who claimed, among other things, that they had received poor care and suffered bedsores. Five of those lawsuits were settled for undisclosed sums.
The hospital was cited twice by Florida regulators, in 2008 and 2010, for having inadequate numbers of nurses on its staff to oversee wound care for patients. During the 2010 examination, regulators noted that Memorial had less than the equivalent of two full-time nurses who specialized in wound care to treat the 132 patients who required aid.
''The system of treatment for wound care places patients at risk for additional medical complications,'' the examiners said.
The hospital said it had taken corrective measures in response to the shortfalls cited by Florida regulators.
HCA says its hospitals have improved and, citing its own internal analysis, says its rate of bedsores is now below the national average. ''We recognize some hospitals within our company are achieving better results than others, and this provides opportunities to learn from our top performers and apply those lessons broadly,'' the company said in a statement last year.
Earlier this year, a jury awarded Mr. Chandler and his family $178 million in damages. This month, Memorial and HCA, which had appealed the jury's verdict, reached a confidential settlement with Mr. Chandler's family.

HEADLINE: A Plea for Hunts Point: Invite Midsize Farmers

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: As the state and other planners plot out a renovation for the Hunts Post produce market in the Bronx, groups seek a role for midsize farmers in the region. 

 BODY:
New York City officials are still negotiating the $350 million renovation of the city's main produce distribution center at Hunts Point in the Bronx, which farmers in the New York region are hoping will make room for them.
On Tuesday, a broad coalition of 45 farms, environmental groups and other advocates jointly sent a letter seeking to put pressure on New York State and city officials to accommodate the region's midsize farms and add a new wholesale farmers' market at Hunts Point in their renovation plans.
Such an addition, supporters argue, would help preserve farmland and sustain midsize local growers in the region that fall through the cracks because they are not large enough to afford the distributors' commissions at Hunts Point and not small enough to sell at the green markets that operate in parks and streets around the city.

"Supporting regional farming can also have a significant economic multiplier effect in rural communities, supporting farm-dependent services such as feed and seed stores, veterinarians and equipment dealers," said the letter, sent to two state agencies and the city's Economic Development Corporation, the lead negotiator in the renovation plans. 
A spokesman for the Economic Development Corporation, Kyle Sklerov, said Tuesday, "Our current focus is on securing a long-term lease with the market co-op and creating a larger, modernized market."
One reason that New York has lacked the kind of central wholesale hub for local food that cities like Paris and Toronto have is opposition from Hunts Point distributors who see the local farmers as competition. 
The cooperative of wholesalers that owns the market leases land from the city but has been invited to move across the Hudson River to New Jersey, where state officials want the sales presence and the 3,000 jobs that come with it.
 Support for creating a local wholesale farmers market has been mounting in recent years as demand for locally produced food has grown. Among those signing the letter were the New York Farm Bureau, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the New York Academy of Medicine and the actor Mark Ruffalo, better known for his campaign against the natural gas drilling process known as fracking.

HEADLINE: Introducing the Ocean Health Index

BYLINE: KELLY SLIVKA


HIGHLIGHT: Comparing different parts of the world's oceans, the index weighs whether the human activity there is sustainable or in need of better management. 

 BODY:
In a potential milestone for ocean management, a team of collaborators has produced the first Ocean Health Index, a tool for appraising the state of the world's oceans. The index takes into account the major factors that influence the quality of regional marine ecosystems like fisheries, biodiversity, tourism and carbon storage and then assigns a score from zero to 100 for each place.
Globally, the oceans received an ocean health score of 60. The lowest score was 36 (Sierra Leone's waters) and the highest was 86 (waters surrounding uninhabited Jarvis Island, near Hawaii).
Dozens of scientists, policymakers and conservationists in the United States and Canada came together over the last two years to create the index, which is described in detail in a paper published online in the journal Nature. Their goal was to find a way to compare different parts of the ocean that are heavily used by humans and determine whether this activity is sustainable or in need of better management.
"You can't manage something like ocean health without actually having a tool to measure it," said Ben Halpern, director of the Center for Marine Assessment and Planning at the University of California, Santa Barbara and one of the leaders of the indexing project. He said the indices provide people who ply the oceans an idea of how their practices affect the marine resources they depend on.

For Dr. Halpern, who is accustomed to field research like surveying corals and counting fish while scuba diving, creating a model based on so many intangible social and economic factors was a challenge. "How do you come up with proxy numbers for things like social values?" he said. The researchers identified goals that varying cultures could relate to.
Mike Fogarty, who studies ecosystems for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Northeastern division, said the index provided a framework that would help federal, state and local agencies in the United States work in tandem on improving coastal health.
NOAA has been focusing its energies on a full ecosystems-based approach to ocean management since President Obama signed the National Ocean Policy into law in 2010, and the index will complement the agency's efforts, Dr. Fogarty said.
Most of the discrete marine regions measured by the project are in waters within 200 miles of a country's shores, the "exclusive economic zones" within which each nation is acknowledged to have control over the resources.
The sustainability of ocean usage is a big part of the score for each region. Other broad factors taken into account by the index are the cleanliness of the water, coastal protection and the "sense of place."
The index also allows individual countries to weight conservation values to reflect their beliefs on how the ocean should be best used. If a country thinks the best way to treat to the ocean is to preserve it, it can weight conservation factors more heavily in its score. If a country thinks the best use for the ocean is to extract resources from it, it can weight those factors more heavily.
Weighted for preservation, the global ocean score would be 67; weighted for high-resource extraction, the score would be 57.
Developing nations, which typically are less able to plan and control ocean usage, tended to have lower scores, and developed nations generally had higher scores. There were a few exceptions: the Seychelles and Suriname scored high, while Poland and Singapore scored relatively poorly.
United States waters received a score of 63; Britain, 61; India, 52; and China, 51.
It's important not to equate Ocean Health Index scores with school grades, Dr. Halpern said. Although the world's oceans received an overall score of 60, they don't get an F for health. The score means there's lots of room for improvement, "but 60 also means here must be some good things going on," he said.
A 60 is right around the score he expected for the global oceans, he said. "I think if it had gotten a 90 or a 15, we would have been surprised," Dr. Halpern added.
The project's collaborators hope to fine-tune the factors built into the index further and reassess the world's oceans over time while communicating with policymakers and ocean managers. Publishing the index is "just the launch pad for what will hopefully be the much larger and more substantial effort of engaging with people," Dr. Halpern said.

HEADLINE: Inflation Deflation

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Is the 12-month inflation rate 1.4 percent, or is it 2.3 percent, or something in between? All of the above. 

 BODY:
The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated on Wednesday that prices rose at an annual pace of 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in July, and even more slowly during July itself. The Federal Reserve likes an annual rate of 2 percent. So it's time for more stimulus, right? QE33333333333!
Well, maybe. But don't pay too much attention to the headline numbers.
Fed officials tend to focus on a different measure, core inflation, which excludes the prices of energy and food. Basically, core inflation is a better predictor of future price movements for all goods, including energy and food, and what the Fed really cares about is the future. 
And the B.L.S. still estimates the annualized rate of core inflation at 2.1 percent.
(It's a measure of the quality of our economics discourse that advocates for additional stimulus often emphasize whichever inflation number is lower, while opponents of action emphasize the higher number. The combatants have traded weapons since the most recent spike in energy prices subsided.)
But don't worry too much about that number, either. The Fed actually prefers a different inflation data set, compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That agency's July price data won't be released until the end of August, but so far this year it has reported a lower rate of price increases each month. 
The difference between the two indexes has to do with the basic truth that when the price of chicken climbs faster than the price of pork, people eat more pork. The Fed used the B.L.S. estimate as its primary measure of inflation until 2000, when it decided that the B.E.A. estimate did a better job of accounting for the substitution of lower-priced goods. The result of such substitutions is to hold down total spending, which is why the B.E.A. estimates tend to be lower.
Through June, this estimate pegged annualized core inflation at 1.8 percent.
But wait, there's more. Many Fed officials still do not regard these numbers as the best possible estimate of how much people actually are spending, and so they use the raw data to compute their own estimates. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, for instance, thinks the June B.E.A. rate should be 1.9 percent. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, which prefers to modify the B.L.S.'s raw data, thinks the magic number in June was 2.3 percent.
And I've saved the most important point for last. The Fed is focused on the future - monetary policy influences the economy only gradually - so what officials really care about is what the data will show in the coming months. Their most recent guesses, published in June, pegged core inflation between 1.2 and 1.7 percent this year - well below their target.
They will bring updated predictions to the next meeting of the Fed's policy-making committee in September. And it is those predictions that may determine whether the Fed decides to ramp up its bond purchases.

HEADLINE: Risk Builds as Junk Bonds Boom

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Demand for high-yield corporate debt is insatiable, even as analysts warn that the market has become overheated and is ripe for a fall. 

 BODY:
Money market funds pay next to nothing. Interest rates on United States Treasuries are dismal. The volatile stock market has been dead money for more than a decade.
But on Wall Street - as the old saying goes - somewhere, someone is making money. And these days, that somewhere is junk bonds.
The market for junk bonds, risky corporate debt that pays high interest rates, is red hot. Such debt, also known as high-yield bonds, has returned 10.2 percent year-to-date, according to a JPMorgan high-yield index. Junk bond funds are on a pace to take in a record amount of money this year. Companies with less than stellar credit are issuing hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds.
 Fueling this frenzy are investors of all stripes - including individuals, mutual funds and state pensions - who are desperate for returns in their bond portfolios and willing to take more risk to get them. Demand is insatiable, even as analysts warn that the market has become overheated and is ripe for a fall.
"In a yield-starved world, high-yield bonds are right now the only game in town," said Les Levi, a managing director at the investment bank North Sea Partners. "The market is giddy."
But a funny thing has happened as everyone has piled into this bond market: high-yield bonds have become something of a misnomer.
The average yields on these bonds have dropped to 6.6 percent, hovering near a record low, according to the Barclays high-yield index. Historically, the interest rate paid on high-yield bonds has been 10 percent or higher. And over the last weeks, several companies have issued speculative-grade debt at yields hardly ever seen in the junk bond market.
"It's amazing: You're now seeing 4 to 5 percent yields for weaker companies," said Adam B. Cohen, founder of Covenant Review, a credit research firm. "These are the type of yields that you used to see for blue chips like Exxon and Pepsi."
Consider the CIT Group, the small-business lender, which three years ago was on the brink of collapse. The company eventually emerged from bankruptcy, hobbled from the wounds it suffered in the financial crisis.
Late last month, investors snapped up $3 billion worth of bonds sold by CIT, which credit ratings agencies continue to view as a risky issuer. The company is paying an interest rate of 4.25 percent on one part of the bonds, and 5 percent on the other. CIT has raised almost $10 billion in junk debt in 2012, making it the year's largest issuer of high-yield bonds.
The record-low yields in the junk bond market are a function of several factors.
First, they reflect the low-interest rate world that has persisted since the crisis. Treasuries are the benchmark for pricing high-yield bonds. Investors receive a higher interest rate for junk bonds, a so-called spread over Treasuries, because the risk of default is higher. And since interest rates on government bonds are so low - the 10-year Treasury is paying a paltry 1.8 percent - companies do not have to pay as much on their bonds.
Yields on junk bonds have also declined because the price of a bond moves inversely to its yield. So as junk bond prices have appreciated, yields have dropped. The return on a bond is made up of its interest rate and price appreciation.
Corporate borrowers look less risky, too. With the economy recovering, albeit unevenly, corporate default rates have fallen and are expected to stay low. The percentage of high-yield issuers that have defaulted on their debt in the last year stands at about 2.8 percent, according to Standard & Poor's, well below the historical norm of 4.5 percent.
The modern junk bond market was built in the freewheeling debt binge of the 1980s. Michael R. Milken, a financier at the investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, initiated the issuance of high-risk, high-yield bonds to pay for hostile takeovers. The market collapsed in 1990 when Drexel declared bankruptcy and Mr. Milken pleaded guilty to securities fraud.
Today looks very different from the go-go 1980s. Companies issuing junk bonds are rarely using the proceeds to make big acquisitions or invest in new businesses. Instead, they are taking advantage of the record-low interest rates to refinance their balance sheets, replacing more expensive debt with cheaper money. By reducing borrowing costs - and in many cases pushing back loan maturities - these companies are reducing the risk that they will default.
"It is a very hospitable environment for issuers," said Howard Marks, the chairman of Oaktree Capital Management. "If you want to fix a problem, you can fix a problem."
Companies have issued record amounts of high-yield debt since the financial crisis. With $184 billion in new public issues sold this year, the market is on pace to approach 2010s record $264 billion in high-yield issuance, according to Thomson Reuters. This month, $25 billion worth of deals have occurred, the most for August.
Companies owned by private equity firms have benefited from the boom in junk bond issuance. Debt-heavy companies taken private in last decade's buyout boom are strengthening their balance sheets by replacing more expensive debt with new high-yield bonds.
Even the most troubled businesses have been able to access the junk bond market. Energy Future Holdings, the Dallas-based utility acquired by the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and TPG in 2007, has struggled amid low natural gas prices. Yet last week, the company raised $600 million in junk bonds, 20 percent more than it had planned to issue.
"It is fair to say that a very strong high-yield market is helping to keep Energy Future Holdings afloat for the time being," said Peter J. Thornton, an analyst at the credit research firm KDP Investment Advisors.
Several Wall Street analysts said there had been very few periods when conditions had been so well suited to the high-yield bond market, both for the companies issuing the bonds and for the investors buying them. With the Federal Reserve saying that it intends to keep interest rates near zero through at least 2014, the demand for riskier, higher-yielding debt as an alternative to Treasuries is expected to continue.
While inflows into the stock market remain weak, investors are pouring money into junk-bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. This year, $20 billion has flowed into these funds, with $9 billion invested in the last nine weeks, Lipper said.
Still, a growing chorus of market players is starting to sound alarm bells. A recent report by Bank of America warned investors against diving headlong into junk bonds at these record-low yields. Not only is there little hope for additional price appreciation, but the companies issuing this debt are vulnerable to a cyclical swing in the economy and slowing business conditions.
"This is not a sustainable state of affairs," wrote the Bank of America analysts Hans Mikkelsen and Oleg Melentyev in a recent report. "While the bid for high-quality yield is understandable in this environment, we question the extension of this reach into the economically and risk appetite-sensitive portions of the credit spectrum."
Mr. Levi of North Sea Partners put it in plainer English, "This could pave the way for some heartbreak down the road."

HEADLINE: Trickle-Down Fairy Dust

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Trickle-down or trickle-up, it's hard to measure the effects of this income redistribution with any accuracy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
 
Generally, transfers do not expand the economy, regardless of whether the recipients are rich or poor. Rather, they confer benefits that are limited to the direct recipients of those transfers.
President Obama recently denigrated the Romney-Ryan economic plan by saying the Republican candidates believe that if Congress gave "more tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans, it will lead to jobs and prosperity for everyone else." He called that approach "trickle-down fairy dust."
The trickle-down theory says that a policy benefiting a specific group, like the wealthiest Americans, will somehow confer benefits on everyone else. One common version of this view is that the benefiting group increases its spending, which in turn benefits the industries whose products are purchased with such additional spending, perhaps leading to the hiring of more workers to meet the increased demand. 
The Obama administration has its own version of this -- what we might call trickle-up -- which says that policies benefiting unemployed people even help people who are not unemployed, because the unemployed react to their government benefits by spending more.

Both of these views are flawed for two reasons. First, the transfer of resources from one group to another probably does not increase aggregate spending (if incentives are held constant), because we have to consider both the spending of the receiving group and the spending of the group that finances the benefits through tax payments or loans to the government.
Transfers may change the composition of spending to the extent that the benefiting group spends its resources differently than the financing group. Cutting taxes on the rich and raising them on the poor would probably, holding incentives constant, increase spending on fancy restaurants, investment goods and yachts, and decrease spending on, say, groceries and cellphones. 
The altered composition of spending can have some interesting, but probably small, effects on the labor market, depending on the labor intensity of the various industries involved (as I noted in a previous post). But changing the composition of spending is not the same as changing the total.
Few transfer programs hold incentives constant. Unemployment insurance reduces the incentive to find work and (especially when it is federally financed) reduces the incentive for businesses to avoid layoffs, and in this way reduces aggregate spending. Sometimes so-called tax cuts and tax credits can reduce spending by discouraging work and redirecting economic activity to less-productive uses.
Even if a transfer from one group to another did increase aggregate spending and output, the second flaw of trickle-down theory is that the additional spending confers benefits beyond the direct beneficiaries of a transfer.
You might think that more spending on, say, groceries would benefit grocers and the farmers who supply them. It's true that a grocer receives funds when a new customer comes to his register. But he also has to provide more groceries or have one of his other customers get by with fewer groceries, and groceries are not free to supply. The funds a seller receives from a new customer may just offset the total costs of the goods provided to the customer, so the seller is hardly better off.
A more nuanced analysis might assume that customers are normally charged more than cost (broadly defined) for the goods they receive, so that sellers are a little better off when aggregate spending increases. It might also consider that some industries are subject to economies of scale, so that other customers are better off when a new customer enters the market. Industries (and the workers they employ) sometimes pay more taxes when they expand, so the public treasury benefits when there's more aggregate spending (the so-called Laffer curve is a special case).
None of this implies that a good public policy cannot transfer from one group to another. Transfers may intrinsically be good: we may enjoy helping the poor or value the freedom associated with limited taxation. Or the direct beneficiaries from redistribution may gain much more than the rest of us lose. 
But until we know more about the magnitude of the second- and third-round effects of transfers on people who do not receive them, redistribution cannot be justified as helping those who finance it.

HEADLINE: Carlyle Group Continues an Unusually Busy Summer

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: With its acquisition of Getty Images, the private equity firm Carlyle Group has completed 19 deals worth more than $14 billion over the past year. 

 BODY:
While summer has traditionally been a slow time for deal making, the Carlyle Group has been on a buying spree in recent weeks.
The buyout firm said on Wednesday that it would buy Getty Images, the big provider of high-quality images and video, from another private equity shop for $3.3 billion. It was the second major buyout that Carlyle announced in the last week, after the takeover of the TCW Group, a Los Angeles-based investment manager, from Société Générale of France.
The two leveraged buyouts are only the latest in a string of recent deals by Carlyle. That list includes taking control of Sunoco's huge Philadelphia refinery and buying a stake in Genesee & Wyoming, a railroad operator that is buying a smaller rival.
 The firm has struck 19 deals worth nearly $14.1 billion over the last 12 months and currently tops the Thomson Reuters rankings of acquisitions by private equity firms.
By contrast, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, another major buyout firm, announced nine deals worth $9.2 billion during the same period, and Bain Capital reported eight deals valued at $4.7 billion. The Blackstone Group disclosed nine deals worth $1.2 billion.
While coincidental - many of the deals have been in the works for months - Carlyle's activity this summer belies a generally slow time for private equity firms. Deal making in general has been hampered by economic uncertainty, which also limited growth in the value of buyout firms' holdings.
Carlyle has not been immune to the industrywide malaise. Last week, the firm announced that it had a $57 million loss in its second quarter, burdened by slow growth in its investments.
Yet even then, executives stressed that they saw opportunities. The firm pointed to $3 billion in realized gains during the quarter, as well as nearly $4 billion in new capital.
William E. Conway, a co-chief executive of Carlyle, has said that a volatile market could unearth interesting bargains for his firm. That has been a common refrain among many buyout executives, who argue that their vast stores of uninvested capital and a potential rise in undervalued companies could only help propel deal making.
"Great investments can be made in a bad economy and lousy investments can be made in a vibrant economy," Mr. Conway said last week on the firm's earnings call with analysts. "Notwithstanding weaker global economic conditions, we see good investing opportunities across our platform."
So far, it appears that Carlyle is carrying through on that promise.
Over all, Carlyle has committed about $5.5 billion in equity capital from its various investment funds for new deals this year.
Executives at the firm said that such a pace is not unusual. Carlyle is one of the largest in the industry, with more than 99 investment funds and 1,300 professionals around the world.
The six deals that the firm announced since July came from five different vehicles. The Getty deal was struck from one of its main United States buyout funds, Carlyle Partners V, while the Sunoco transaction was made from the firm's Equity Opportunity and Energy Mezzanine Opportunities funds.
"There's been no big shift in our mind-set that now is a good time to deploy capital," Peter J. Clare, a co-head of Carlyle's United States buyouts group, said in a telephone interview. "It's more a reflection of the depth of our industry teams and the capital of our funds."
The Getty deal arose out of an auction that the image provider's current owner, the buyout firm Hellman & Friedman, began running several months ago.
Over all, executives expect the Carlyle's main American buyout fund, which has $13.7 billion under management, to reach a general investment target of about 20 percent of its available capital.
"We're right on track for what I'd call an average year in terms of equity investment from the U.S. buyout fund," Mr. Clare said.
With debt financing relatively cheap at the moment and with more companies willing to sell themselves, Carlyle executives said that the firm has simply benefited from more opportunities, without lowering the benchmarks for its investments.
"We're holding to the same standards," Mr. Clare said. "But more companies coming to the market is putting more opportunities in front of us."

HEADLINE: Is That New England Accent in Retreat?

BYLINE: JENNIFER SCHUESSLER


HIGHLIGHT: Research shows that the line separating people who drop their R's from those who don't has moved toward the east. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney drew some criticism in March when he wrestled over the pronunciation of "Missouri." But some residents of the state where he spends his vacations, according to a recent article in the journal American Speech, have become increasingly uncertain how to pronounce "New Hampshire."
It used to be that people east of the Green Mountains, which run through the middle of Vermont, reliably called it "New Hampsha." But in "Farewell to the Founders: Major Dialect Changes Along the East-West New England Border,"three linguists show that the line separating people who drop their R's from those who don't has moved toward the east, to the Vermont-New Hampshire border - and, in the case of young people, has even encroached deep into the Granite State itself.
And it isn't just a matter of "non-rhoticity," the technical name for the speech pattern that makes people "pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd." The study's authors - James N. Stanford, Thomas A. Leddy-Cecere and Kenneth P. Baclawski Jr. - also discovered an erosion of several other distinctive features of eastern New England speech, including the different vowels for "father" and "bother" and for "Mary," "merry," and "marry." (The distinction between "horse" and "hoarse," however, seems to be hanging on.)
"After so many generations of consistent transmission" traceable back to 18th-century settlers, the authors declare, "the social patterns laid down by the founders are now rapidly shifting and dissipating in the current generation." 
The east-west distinction in northern New England speech was first described in the 1939 Linguistic Atlas of New England and held firm in a 1987 study based on data gathered in the 1960s for the Dictionary of American Regional English. But over the past decade, the current study's authors - all of whom have long roots in New England - began noting that they heard the distinction less reliably and set out to investigate.
Aided by a team of students from Dartmouth, they began by doing two sets of interviews: first with 39 senior citizens from across northern New Hampshire and Vermont, and another with 23 young and old speakers in Claremont, N.H., just over the Vermont border. Participants were asked to read a list of words and sentences along with part of a text called "How to Survive a New England Winter."
After careful acoustical analysis, the authors arrived at a clear conclusion: the east-west speech border had moved from the Green Mountains to the Vermont-New Hampshire border, and among the young it seemed close to vanishing. Some of the change, the authors suggest, is deliberate, as people seek to avoid the stigma of sounding like they come from the "backwoods" - or perhaps worse, Boston. Asked whether she ever dropped R's or used other eastern New England variants, one young Claremont woman told the researchers, "Only when mocking someone from Massachusetts."
The study is not without its political implications. The emergence of the rhotic R in New Hampshire, the researchers suggest, may reflect the spread of the "Live Free or Die" mentality that has crept north as refugees from "Taxachusetts" seek linguistic as well as economic independence from their more liberal brethren to the south. But the survival of more subtle eastern dialect features like the horse/hoarse distinction, the authors write, may also reflect an emerging "modern northern New Englander identity" untethered to traditional rural culture.
As Mr. Leddy-Cecere, a New England native now teaching at the University of Texas, is quoted as saying in the paper: "I'm not an Old Vermonter. But I'm not a flatlander either. I'm a Vermonter."

HIGHLIGHT: Cadillac will show two V-16-powered Fleetwood roadsters built from sketches from the 1930s at Pebble Beach this weekend. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 From Thursday through Sunday on the grounds of the Pebble Beach Concours d'Élégance, Cadillac will show two V-16-powered Fleetwood roadsters built decades after the Great Depression, when they were initially offered in a special-order catalog. The pair will be joined by a 1953 Le Mans convertible, a concept exhibited in the touring G.M. Motorama shows of the early and mid-1950s. (General Motors)
 Mercedes-Benz announced pricing on Tuesday for its E400 Hybrid midsize sedan. The company expects the $56,705 car to return combined fuel economy of 27 m.p.g. It is powered by a 302-horsepower direct-injection V-6 gasoline engine and a 27-horsepower electric motor. The E300 BlueTec Hybrid, a diesel hybrid exhibited during the Detroit auto show in January, is not expected to be offered in the United States. (Mercedes-Benz)
 Bloomberg reports that owners of exotic automobiles in Italy, faced with increasing annual taxes on luxury goods, are shipping their vehicles to other European Union countries for resale. The Italian government has also conducted random checks of motorists' tax records to confirm their declared income was sufficient to own a luxury vehicle. (Bloomberg)
 A release date has been set for "Rush," the film directed by Ron Howard about the rivalry between the Formula One drivers Niki Lauda and James Hunt in the 1970s. The film, released by Universal Studios, is scheduled to be in limited release on Sept. 20, 2013. (Indiewire, via Autoblog)
An earlier version of this post said the two Cadillac Fleetwoods scheduled be featured at Pebble Beach were built during the Great Depression. Though they were made available for order in a special order catalog in the '30s, no customers selected them. They were not built until "decades later," G.M. said, by Fran Roxas, an enthusiast of the brand.

HEADLINE: Remember Iraq?

BYLINE: CAROL GIACOMO


HIGHLIGHT: A new report should prod people to think more seriously about America's role in the country we invaded. 

 BODY:
Since troops withdrew at the end of 2011, Iraq has receded from the American public consciousness. Just consider the U.S. presidential campaign where the economy - understandably - predominates. President Obama and Mitt Romney rarely even mention the country we invaded.
A report issued on Tuesday by the Council on Foreign Relations should prod people to think more seriously about Iraq and America's continuing role there.
Iraq has undoubtedly made progress. Violence is at its lowest level since 2003, the economy is growing modestly, oil production is up and foreign investment is trickling in, helping Iraqis rebuild infrastructure.

But devastating attacks still occur and a political struggle between Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and other political leaders has intensified. So have tensions between Kurds and Arabs. The report's author, Douglas Ollivant of the New America Foundation, also says intra-Shia violence, which has not been much of a factor in recent years, is a serious possibility. The spillover effects of war in Syria and turmoil in Egypt and elsewhere only add to the uncertainties.
Mr. Ollivant thinks he's identified how the U.S. can help Iraqis manage internal threats, including with improved intelligence cooperation, support for the electoral process and fostering better relations between Iraq and Turkey. That's all very reasonable. The candidates also have a responsibility to share their ideas with voters.

LAS VEGAS - At a private gathering with Representative Paul D. Ryan, Sheldon Adelson, the billionaire casino owner and Republican super-donor, offered no public remarks and, somewhat surprisingly, his pet cause of Israel was not part of the conversation, according to an attendee. 
Mr. Adelson, who has pledged up to $100 million to defeat President Obama, invited about three dozen wealthy potential donors to a meeting with Mr. Ryan in a luxury suite with a guarded elevator at his Venetian hotel here on Tuesday evening. Outside, several hundred members of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. chanted and waved signs reading "Paul Ryan: Hustling for the 1 percent.'' 
Mr. Adelson is a longtime contributor to Republicans, especially those who are staunch supporters of Israel, though he appears not to have contributed before to Mr. Ryan's Congressional races or political action committee. He kept any personal advocacy on behalf of Mr. Ryan very quiet on Wednesday. 
"I saw no dialogue between the two of them,'' said the attendee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because guests were told not to discuss details of the meeting.
The gathering was hastily arranged by phone rather than written invitations, and guests were not asked for contributions. One Republican strategist in Las Vegas described it as a "donor maintenance" event to introduce Mr. Ryan to potential backers.
The meeting was in the Paiza Club, a private casino and dining room on the hotel's 36th floor, built primarily for Asian high-rollers with six- and seven-figure credit lines. 
The 30 to 40 guests spoke with Mr. Ryan individually and in groups, cocktail-party style. The chief focus was his budget blueprint that the House has passed and that would effectively shift Medicare toward an optional voucher program, lower tax rates and deeply cut many social programs, in an effort to balance the federal checkbook.
"He's full of energy, he's very smart, he is a wizard on the budget,'' said the attendee. "Most of us care very deeply about the position America is in right now as far as economic health, and he is very good at having specific answers.''
Although Mr. Ryan may be willing to discuss budget specifics behind closed doors, since being named the vice-presidential nominee he has avoided any public mention of his budget plan - an aggressive road map that was the reason many commentators called Mr. Romney's selection of him as his running mate bold and potentially risky. Mr. Obama is seeking to use the Ryan budget plan against the Republican ticket in the battle for independent voters. 
Mr. Romney, who has endorsed the Ryan budget, seemed to back away Wednesday from one provision - a cut of about $700 billion from the future growth of Medicare, which is similar to cuts in the health care law Mr. Obama signed in 2010. 
"The president's cuts of $716 billion to Medicare, those cuts are going to be restored if I become president and Paul Ryan becomes vice president," Mr. Romney told CBS News. 
Asked if he was running on Mr. Ryan's budget or his own, Mr. Romney said: "My budget, of course. I'm the one running for president."

HEADLINE: Bridgewater to Spend $750 Million on New Offices

BYLINE: AZAM AHMED


HIGHLIGHT: The hedge fund giant will be constructing a state-of-the-art headquarters along the waterfront of Stamford, Conn., as part of an economic and community development initiative. 

 BODY:
There are hedge funds, and then there is Bridgewater Associates.
If its assets, which at $130 billion are nearly double the size of its closest competitor, were not enough to set it apart from the rest of the industry, then a new $750 million headquarters on the Connecticut waterfront certainly will.
On Wednesday, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut announced that the asset manager would be constructing a state-of-the-art office along the Stamford waterfront as part of an economic and community development initiative. As part of the program, which will give the firm as much as $115 million in incentives as part of the deal, Bridgewater has also promised to add another 750 to 1,000 new high-level jobs to its current staff of 1,225.
 "For a long time, our state failed to compete for the kinds of good paying jobs with good benefits that will grow and sustain our economy," Governor Malloy said in a statement. "To have a company of Bridgewater's stature make the business decision to invest $750 million in our state and significantly increase its workforce is not only an extraordinary economic 'win,' but signals to the rest of the world that Connecticut is strengthening its leadership position in the very competitive financial services sector."
Bridgewater, however, stepped back from committing to the project, noting there was still more due diligence to conduct before the building could become a reality.
"While we are excited about the prospect of bringing all of our people together under one roof and, in the process helping to restore the waterfront in Stamford, a lot of work needs to be done to see if a move to the Stamford campus can become a reality," the firm said in a statement. "This work includes exploring both approvals from the City of Stamford and its various committees and boards, as well as conducting additional due diligence about a host of cost, design and community related issues."
The move is an extraordinary one for a hedge fund, and is another example of Bridgewater's efforts to institutionalize itself. In addition to making top-level hires to diversify leadership at the firm, Bridgewater sold an ownership stake to a public pension fund in Texas in February to expand its ownership base. Both measures were aimed at creating a sustainable business for the future.
But such moves can be perilous. Hedge funds have notoriously fragile businesses. Several shut down in the last two years after federal agents raided them as part of an insider trading investigation. Investment decisions go wrong and firms blow up - a lesson that numerous funds learned during the financial crisis. And even in the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the business model is tough to sustain.
Major corporations with predictable business models have long taken advantage of tax breaks for new facilities and hiring. However, profit at hedge funds depend on performance, and with markets caught in a state of uncertainty it's hard for any firm to know how much money it will make in a given year. 
Bridgewater has managed to set itself apart on that front in recent years. During the last two years, it has notched some of the industry's biggest gains, even as competitors' returns flagged. And over the last 20 years, the firm has returned an average 15 percent a year to investors, placing it among the top of the industry.
"There's no guarantees on investments and there will always be some fluctuations in there, but Bridgewater's model has been proven successful for more than 30 years," said Ronald F. Angelo Jr., the deputy commissioner of the state's department of economic and community development. "The company obviously feels confident in their business model."
The firm, led by its enigmatic founder, Ray Dalio, has taken heat in recent years for its peculiar culture. Mr. Dalio, a Harvard Business School graduate, is a disciple of radical transparency, a belief set founded on the pursuit of truth at all costs. Such honesty can be a tough pill to swallow, and has prompted some employees to depart the firm. Still, everyone is allowed to speak freely - mid-level employees can take upper management to task if they disagree with their thinking. 
Former employees jokingly say the current offices, spread over five different buildings in Westport, Conn., evoke Big Brother. In the interest of transparency, overhead cameras record employees throughout the day, for instance.
It is unclear what kind of surveillance the new office, to be completed by 2017, will have. 
The new offices will have about 750,000 square feet spread across two eco-friendly buildings on the waterfront in the Harbor Point development area. Bridgewater has promised to clean up the contaminated site and reforest the area, creating a parklike campus for its employees with public access.
"We are pleased that the State of Connecticut shares our vision of creating a state of the art and environmentally sustainable office campus, while also restoring this key piece of natural waterfront property in Stamford," Greg Jensen, co-chief executive of Bridgewater, said in a statement. "We look forward to transforming this industrial site into a spectacularly beautiful forested campus that will be seamlessly integrated into the natural surroundings. The proposed campus will house all of our employees and be designed to facilitate creativity, collaboration and help reinforce Bridgewater's distinct culture which has been so instrumental to our success."

HEADLINE: State Regulators Widen Libor Investigation

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, subpoenaed several banks last month, including JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. 

 BODY:
State regulators are widening their investigation into interest rate manipulation, pursuing wrongdoing at seven of the world's biggest banks. 
The New York State attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, subpoenaed several banks last month, including JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland, a person briefed on the matter said. The requests for information follow Mr. Schneiderman's decision this year to open inquires into Citigroup and UBS, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
HSBC and Barclays, the British bank that recently settled rate-rigging accusations with federal authorities, have also received subpoenas from Mr. Schneiderman.
 The New York regulator's push to ramp up his investigation reflects the broader escalation of the rate-rigging case. The Connecticut attorney general, George Jepsen, has joined the New York investigation, while state attorneys general in Massachusetts and Maryland have opened their own inquiries. 
The state scrutiny comes on top of a wide-ranging federal investigation, involving regulators and the Justice Department, as well as several examinations from authorities overseas. Some traders at banks around the world are also facing potential criminal charges. 
The case centers on how banks set a benchmark rate, the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which affects the cost of trillions of dollars in mortgages and other loans. In June, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million for reporting false rates to bolster its profits and project a rosy image of its health. 
Spokeswomen for the attorneys general in New York and Connecticut declined to comment. News of the subpoenas was first reported by Bloomberg News.

HEADLINE: Downtown Comes Uptown: Madison Avenue

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
EVER since the recession, Madison Avenue, a barometer of New York City's retail health if ever there was one, has undergone what could be described as three stages of grief:In 2009, there was denial, when landlords continued asking for gilded-era rents, despite the lack of interested renters. In 2010, there was acceptance, when tumbleweeds could be glimpsed in empty storefronts and salespeople became uncommonly friendly. In 2011, there was bargaining, when designers, sensing an opportunity, pounced on leases with what, in retrospect, turned out to be rock-bottom rents.
Well, to put it mildly, grief is so last year.
Conspicuous consumption has made a resounding return to Madison Avenue, at least on that mile of glistening shops stretching north of Barneys New York at East 60th Street. But it isn't quite the same Madison Avenue as what was there before. 
Nearly 50 stores have opened in the last 18 months, including a diverse mix of European luxury labels (Céline and Bottega Veneta), contemporary brands (Vince, Zadig & Voltaire, Rebecca Taylor, Alice + Olivia, Theory and Rag & Bone) and hipper American designers (Proenza Schouler and, coming soon, Monique Lhuillier). There's a concept store called Fivestory, at 18 East 69th Street, that carries cool lines like Visvim and specialized Nikes.
Meanwhile, longstanding tenants like Lanvin, Oscar de la Renta and Chanel are expanding, and other labels, Etro and Gucci among them, are spiffing up their existing stores.
There was a time, and not so long ago, when Madison Avenue, like much of the Upper East Side, would have resisted such changes, especially the arrival of stores like J. Crew, which now has, egad, four stores above 65th Street, and the younger shoppers who now cruise the contemporary blocks of shops like Intermix and Theory. This isn't the meatpacking district.
''There is a new customer on Madison Avenue, and not just for our store,'' said LeAnn Nealz, the president of Juicy Couture, which opened at 860 Madison Avenue in 2006, now facing Tom Ford and separated from Céline by Ladurée macarons and Chrome Hearts glitzy sunglasses. Ms. Nealz has lived on the Upper East Side for 25 years, and remembers when the fancy fabric store Pierre Deux was on the block.
''You can now buy a piece of art, some shoes and a panini,'' Ms. Nealz said. ''It's nice having old world New York mixed with some of these younger, hipper brands.''
Tourists were always welcome to press their noses against the glass, but there was once a sense that Madison Avenue was like the world's most insular shopping mall. Amid stores that telegraphed excess merely by the spotless shine of their glass doors, and somehow adding to the charm of the place, were budget diners and coffee shops serving chicken salad in the shell of a tomato. Alternately, there was La Goulue, with its $28.50 plate of roast chicken and rubbernecking socialites, but that restaurant is long gone, along with that slice of Madison Avenue. (Now that space is the flagship of Loro Piana cashmere.)
It was the bacon and eggs at Gardenia Cafe and Restaurant, a Greek diner at 797 Madison Avenue, that was a sort of madeleine for Tory Burch, who now lives in a town house a few blocks away. Back when she was just ''a Philadelphia farm girl,'' as she said, driving into the city with her mother, the first destination was Madison Avenue to look at the window displays.
''It was somewhat of an institution,'' Ms. Burch said.
Last September, Ms. Burch, who creates clothes that evoke the lifestyles of the rich and famous at slightly more accessible prices, opened her largest store yet on the site of that diner, which closed in 2007. Ms. Burch took over the entire building, remodeling it with three floors of selling space, a library and vast swaths of marble, mirrors, lacquer and gilt, or what the architect Daniel Romualdez imagined the space might have looked like in the 1880s.
Ms. Burch, who has 73 stores around the world, had been looking for a space on Madison Avenue, but the rents were daunting. She was close to a deal in 2008 for a small store, but she wisely held back and eventually landed a better deal. After 2009, rents on the avenue averaged $600 to $800 a square foot, down from $1,000 or more, according to brokers.
Historically, designers have seen Madison Avenue as a place to run a store as if it were a billboard, a so-called loss leader. But for designers like Ms. Burch, and more of those contemporary labels entering Madison Avenue, being profitable is a priority, which means people actually have to be there to shop.
''From a performance standpoint, it's going to be one of our top stores,'' she said. ''It's not just about marketing.''
EVERY six months, Jim Leniart, the owner and creator of Red Maps, a series of foldout guides to major shopping destinations, updates a map of Midtown that includes every store along Madison Avenue up to 79th Street. Taking a taxi up the avenue the other day, Mr. Leniart observed that there was not even a dry spot anymore. This was curious in a slow-moving economy, and at a time when retail sales have been shaky at best.
''Nowhere else is there this kind of concentration of stores,'' Mr. Leniart said, noting that between 60th and 78th Streets, or roughly one mile, there are 82 designer-clothing boutiques, 34 high-end jewelry stores and 34 stores specializing in categories like shoes, handbags or eyewear. ''I have to believe that wealth is a factor.''
And Madison Avenue, at its core, is a local shopping district for a neighborhood that has one of the densest concentrations of wealthy residents in the world. Matthew A. Bauer, the president of the Madison Avenue Business Improvement District (BID), described it as ''their Main Street.'' For that reason, the street was poised to rebound more quickly than shopping destinations that rely on heavy traffic from tourists.
When Proenza Schouler opened a store at 822 Madison Avenue in July, it was an unexpected choice because the label's designers, Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez, work and associate with a largely downtown crowd. But the reality is that their customers live uptown, and as Mr. Hernandez told Women's Wear Daily, Madison Avenue ''just seems kind of big league.''
The store, small at 2,000 square feet, sticks out like a sore pinkie, with displays of handbags set amid large cactuses and eerily dark walls. (This is the first store by the architect David Adjaye, who has built homes for Alexander McQueen and Jake Chapman.) On a recent afternoon, two young customers were examining the bags with a delight approaching the indecent. And they were men.
Since major designers saw the recession as an opportunity to reinvest on the street -- notably Ralph Lauren, who in 2010 opened a new flagship at 72nd Street to rival his existing flagship in the Rhinelander Mansion on the other side of the street -- there are surprisingly few vacant spaces. In 2009, there were more than two dozen vacancies and another two dozen tenants looking to break their leases. Now new stores are coming from Pucci, Yigal Azrouël, Kate Spade, Belstaff and Brian Atwood.
''They think I'm a bakery!'' said Faith Hope Consolo, the chairman of the retail group of Douglas Elliman. ''Designers call from Europe and Asia, and they all ask me, 'Is there a building available on Madison Avenue?' ''
It will not come as a surprise that landlords once again are asking (asking, mind you) for rents of $1,500 a square foot, higher than before the recession. Nor that the Madison Avenue BID, which tracks store openings (but not closings) from 57th to 86th Streets, announced in July that ''Madison Avenue Welcomes Twenty New Stores in the First Half of 2012.'' Nor that, as a result of the arrival of more brands that can afford those rents, Madison Avenue could begin to look like every other street of luxury shops on the planet.
Jackie Rogers, around since the 1960s, has already been squeezed out: The latest store she opened at 787 Madison in 2009 closed two years later.
''They are all big companies putting in the stores now,'' she said. ''I don't know if they even make any money. I think they just want to be there.''
From the perspective of retail, that is a better fate than empty storefronts.
''Customers today are buying from high to low,'' said Andrew Rosen, the fashion executive who is a founder of Theory and is involved in the businesses of Helmut Lang, Proenza Schouler, Alice + Olivia and Rag & Bone, all of which have joined the landscape. He was talking of both the high and low ends of fashion, but he could as well have been speaking about the stores all along the length of Madison Avenue.
''It's got a great mix,'' he said, ''and that just creates a more dynamic shopping experience.''

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
President Dilma Rousseff announced a nearly $66 billion investment package on Wednesday to beef up the nation's ailing road and rail systems, part of efforts to solve serious transportation bottlenecks and spur a sputtering economy. The investment includes laying 6,200 miles of train tracks and building or widening 4,660 miles of federal highways, with more plans soon for airports, ports and transportation on waterways. ''We're starting an initial stage from which Brazil will emerge richer and stronger,'' Ms. Rousseff said. ''Brazil will finally have an infrastructure that's compatible with its size.'' Brazil's growth is slowing, but the nation has yet to feel the brunt of crises that have hit Europe and the United States since 2008. The announcement comes as Brazil gears up to host the 2014 soccer World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.

After suffering the largest share of job losses in the recession, Americans with no more than a high school education have continued to lose jobs during the sputtering recovery while better-educated people have gained millions of jobs, according to a Georgetown University study.Over nearly five years of financial turmoil, Americans across a broad spectrum have suffered blows to wages, benefits and savings. But when it comes to employment, the crux of financial survival, the study revealed a tale of sharply different economies, defined by education. 
Even during the recession, as millions of jobs vanished, the number of people with bachelor's degrees who had jobs did not decline. And even as employment rose during the recovery, people who did not go to college continued to lose ground, shedding 200,000 jobs from early 2010 to early 2012.
''The extent of both are surprising,'' said Anthony P. Carnevale, director of the Center on Education and the Workforce at Georgetown and a co-author of the study. ''The economy we all have in our minds is the one we had in 2006, and it's gone.''
The study, based on data collected by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, divided the nation's work force of 140 million people into three groups: those who did not go to college, those with some college education or an associate degree, and those with at least a bachelor's degree.
From late 2007, when the recession began, to early 2012, the number of people with jobs in the least-educated group fell by more than 5.8 million, or 10 percent. In the middle group, recession losses were not as steep and were almost completely reversed by early this year. And in the best-educated group, in which there was no net loss during the recession, the number of people with jobs climbed by 2.2 million, or 5 percent.
(The Georgetown researchers relied on the government's Current Population Survey, rather than on a different government count, Current Employment Statistics. Each has drawbacks, and Current Employment Statistics showed deeper job losses during the recession, but the overall patterns were similar.)
The disparity in employment based on education has been growing since the 1980s, Mr. Carnevale said, but ''both the recession and the recovery have sharply accelerated that structural change.''
The manufacturing, construction and transportation industries, which depend heavily on less-educated workers, had the sharpest job losses in the recession. Those fields are also dominated by men, leading to much commentary that it was a mostly male recession.
But the Georgetown researchers found that the sex disparity had narrowed, with women benefiting less from the recovery, in part because they are disproportionately affected by the decline in government employment.
The most hopeful finding, Mr. Carnevale said, is that in recent years more men than women have returned to school to make themselves more employable, reversing a longstanding trend.
''We seem to have hit the boys hard enough to wake them up,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Global (Not Euro-Zone) Crisis

BYLINE: By HAL S. SCOTT

 BODY:
The euro-zone crisis has striking parallels with our experience in two world wars, when the United States mistakenly calculated that Europe could solve its own foreign policy problems and that Americans were immune from the consequences of the Continent's failure to do so.Europe's failure twice plunged the world into war. In today's globalized economic world, Europe's failure to resolve its financial crisis could plunge the world into economic chaos. This is a global crisis -- not a euro-zone crisis -- and we must take international action to deal with it.

HEADLINE: Debt-Laden Chinese Solar Firms Need Infusion of Funds

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
As solar panel prices continue to tumble, Chinese solar companies are struggling with heavy debt loads, fueling expectations that many will be forced to seek new infusions of funds through takeovers or mergers.Suntech Power Holdings could be liable for hundreds of millions in new payments after it disclosed a potential fraud by a partner, while peers like LDK Solar, JA Solar Holdings, Trina Solar and Yingli Green Energy Holding are also feeling pressure.
With prices for solar panels barely covering the cost to build them, dozens of small Chinese solar companies are believed to have shut their doors, and equity investors have fled the sector, sending share prices of the U.S.-listed Chinese companies down more than 85 percent since early 2011. 
Most of the Chinese solar companies will be able to stay open only if government lenders continue to keep lines of credit open despite forecasts of several more quarters of red ink.
''Solar as an industry is going to continue to grow,'' said Brian Salerno, portfolio manager for Huntington EcoLogical Strategy ETF. ''However, my belief is that for most of that time it's going to be profitless prosperity.''
Solar analysts have pointed to LDK Solar as also having one of the country's most stretched balance sheets, with debt and other liabilities of $6 billion versus cash and equivalents of just $244 million.
JA Solar listed its debt and other liabilities at $1.5 billion versus cash on hand of $676 million at the end of the first quarter. Trina Solar's debt was a more modest $1.08 billion versus cash on hand of $490 million, while Yingli reported debt of $3.44 billion versus cash of $675 million at the end of the first quarter.
Suntech, which has the largest panel-manufacturing capacity, may be on the hook for $690 million in collateral related to the possible fraud, and it also has a $541 million convertible bond payment in early 2013.
The company, which had said it was in violation of some loan covenants, listed total debt and other liabilities of $3.58 billion, versus abut $474 million in cash on hand as of March 31, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Beijing has provided billions of dollars in credit lines and other supports to its solar sector through state-run banks, prompting the U.S. government to impose import duties this year after U.S. manufacturers filed a trade complaint.
Though analysts and solar competitors outside China have long viewed government bank credit lines as a major funding advantage for Chinese solar makers, that support has encouraged the industry there to overspend on new factories, leading to a glut of panels on the market.
Obtaining a clear picture of the Chinese companies' debts can be difficult, analysts said, because debts they often listed as short-term liabilities are perpetually rolled forward, essentially making them long-term facilities.
''Trina is probably the best positioned. The cost structure is great, and they don't have as much debt as other vendors,'' said Ben Schuman, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities.
Nearly every solar company has been losing cash because of low panel prices, and policy makers in Beijing said last year that they wanted to see a healthier industry develop, with a smaller number of large, strong players.
Whether that consolidation will be spurred by Beijing or the debt-holding banks remains unclear.
''That's the million-dollar question,'' Mr. Schuman said. ''I don't know if it's really even a question of if or when; it's more a question of how. Is this going to be forced consolidation, or a bailout of the debt by state-owned enterprises?''
Analysts said that at least for now, Beijing was not likely to let its leading solar players collapse.
''As long as the government has deep pockets -- and they do -- you might just have the walking dead,'' said Mr. Salerno of Huntington.
Local governments in China have also supported the companies in an industry that China sees as crucial to supplying electricity to its economy, but analysts said that support appears to focused on keeping the local job markets strong.
LDK Solar, which cut 5,000 jobs this year, was helped in July, when the government of Xinyu, in Jiangxi Province, announced that it would use taxpayer funds to repay the company's loans.
Still, Yingli's chief financial officer, Li Zongwei, said the Chinese state-run banks and foreign debt providers appeared willing to support the companies with the best prospects, and wait for a shakeout to trim the weaker players.
The banks ''all believe that solar is an emerging industry that has a bright future, and a much better future after the consolidation,'' he said. ''They don't want to give up their debt presence in the solar sector.''
Mr. Li said the company would generate cash flow in the second half of 2012, but predicted new players would enter China's solar sector to take over or buy into weaker companies.
''To a large extent, I think the capital will be coming from the state-owned companies, or large domestic groups,'' Mr. Li said.
For its part, Yingli, which tapped China's debt market for about $236 million in May, is not interested in linking up with other companies, he said, but may seek to acquire equipment at low cost to expand operations.

HEADLINE: Risk Builds as Junk Bonds Boom

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Money market funds pay next to nothing. Interest rates on United States Treasuries are dismal. The volatile stock market has been dead money for more than a decade.But on Wall Street -- as the old saying goes -- somewhere, someone is making money. And these days, that somewhere is junk bonds.
The market for junk bonds, risky corporate debt that pays high interest rates, is red hot. Such debt, also known as high-yield bonds, has returned 10.2 percent year-to-date, according to a JPMorgan high-yield index. Junk bond funds are on a pace to take in a record amount of money this year. Companies with less than stellar credit are issuing hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds.
Fueling this frenzy are investors of all stripes -- including individuals, mutual funds and state pensions -- who are desperate for returns in their bond portfolios and willing to take more risk to get them. Demand is insatiable, even as analysts warn that the market has become overheated and is ripe for a fall. 
''In a yield-starved world, high-yield bonds are right now the only game in town,'' said Les Levi, a managing director at the investment bank North Sea Partners. ''The market is giddy.''
But a funny thing has happened as everyone has piled into this bond market: high-yield bonds have become something of a misnomer.
The average yields on these bonds have dropped to 6.6 percent, hovering near a record low, according to the Barclays high-yield index. Historically, the interest rate paid on high-yield bonds has been 10 percent or higher. Over the last weeks, several companies have issued speculative-grade debt at yields rarely seen in the junk bond market.
''It's amazing: You're now seeing 4 to 5 percent yields for weaker companies,'' said Adam B. Cohen, founder of Covenant Review, a credit research firm. ''These are the type of yields that you used to see for blue chips like Exxon and Pepsi.''
Consider the CIT Group, the small-business lender, which three years ago was on the brink of collapse. The company eventually emerged from bankruptcy, hobbled from the wounds it suffered in the financial crisis.
Late last month, investors snapped up $3 billion worth of bonds sold by CIT, which credit ratings agencies continue to view as a risky issuer. The company is paying an interest rate of 4.25 percent on one part of the bonds, and 5 percent on the other. CIT has raised almost $10 billion in junk debt in 2012, making it the year's largest issuer of high-yield bonds.
The record-low yields in the junk bond market are a function of several factors.
First, they reflect the low-interest rate world that has persisted since the crisis. Treasuries are the benchmark for pricing high-yield bonds. Investors receive a higher interest rate for junk bonds, a so-called spread over Treasuries, because the risk of default is higher. And since interest rates on government bonds are so low -- the 10-year Treasury is paying a paltry 1.8 percent -- companies do not have to pay as much on their bonds.
Yields on junk bonds have also declined because the price of a bond moves inversely to its yield. So as junk bond prices have appreciated, yields have dropped. The return on a bond is made up of its interest rate and price appreciation.
Corporate borrowers look less risky, too. With the economy recovering, albeit unevenly, corporate default rates have fallen and are expected to stay low. The percentage of high-yield issuers that have defaulted on their debt in the last year stands at about 2.8 percent, according to Standard & Poor's, well below the historical norm of 4.5 percent.
The modern junk bond market was built in the freewheeling debt binge of the 1980s. Michael R. Milken, a financier at the investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert, initiated the issuance of high-risk, high-yield bonds to pay for hostile takeovers. The market collapsed in 1990 when Drexel declared bankruptcy and Mr. Milken pleaded guilty to securities fraud.
Today looks very different from the go-go 1980s. Companies issuing junk bonds are rarely using the proceeds to make big acquisitions or invest in new businesses. Instead, they are taking advantage of the record-low interest rates to refinance their balance sheets, replacing more expensive debt with cheaper money. By reducing borrowing costs -- and in many cases pushing back loan maturities -- these companies are reducing the risk that they will default.
''It is a very hospitable environment for issuers,'' said Howard Marks, the chairman of Oaktree Capital Management. ''If you want to fix a problem, you can fix a problem.''
Companies have issued record amounts of high-yield debt since the financial crisis. With $184 billion in new public issues sold this year, the market is on pace to approach 2010's record $264 billion in high-yield issuance, according to Thomson Reuters. This month, $25 billion worth of deals have occurred, the most for August.
Companies owned by private equity firms have benefited from the boom in junk bond issuance. Debt-heavy companies taken private in last decade's buyout boom are strengthening their balance sheets by replacing more expensive debt with new high-yield bonds.
Even the most troubled businesses have been able to access the junk bond market. Energy Future Holdings, the Dallas-based utility acquired by the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company and TPG in 2007, has struggled amid low natural gas prices. Yet last week, the company raised $600 million in junk bonds, 20 percent more than it had planned to issue.
''It is fair to say that a very strong high-yield market is helping to keep Energy Future Holdings afloat for the time being,'' said Peter J. Thornton, an analyst at the credit research firm KDP Investment Advisors.
Several Wall Street analysts said there had been very few periods when conditions had been so well suited to the high-yield bond market, both for the companies issuing the bonds and for the investors buying them. With the Federal Reserve saying that it intends to keep interest rates near zero through at least 2014, the demand for riskier, higher-yielding debt as an alternative to Treasuries is expected to continue.
While inflows into the stock market remain weak, investors are pouring money into junk-bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. This year, $20 billion has flowed into these funds, with $9 billion invested in the last nine weeks, according to Lipper, a firm that tracks mutual fund data.
Still, a growing chorus of market players is starting to sound alarm bells. A recent report by Bank of America warned investors against diving headlong into junk bonds at these record-low yields. Not only is there little hope for additional price appreciation, but the companies issuing this debt are vulnerable to a cyclical swing in the economy and slowing business conditions.
''This is not a sustainable state of affairs,'' wrote the Bank of America analysts Hans Mikkelsen and Oleg Melentyev in a recent report. ''While the bid for high-quality yield is understandable in this environment, we question the extension of this reach into the economically and risk appetite-sensitive portions of the credit spectrum.''
Mr. Levi of North Sea Partners put it in plainer English, ''This could pave the way for some heartbreak down the road.''

HEADLINE: The Case for Natural Gas Exports

BYLINE: By MICHAEL A. LEVI. 
Michael A. Levi is a senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:
NEW data released last month signaled a milestone for American energy: natural gas joined coal as the top source of electric power. Gas production has boomed on the back of abundant supplies. That has spurred debates over hydraulic fracturing, a method to extract gas from shale.A related political and economic debate has emerged. A string of companies have applied for permission to export liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G., to countries that don't have special free-trade agreements with the United States. Under federal law, the Energy Department has to find such exports to be consistent with the ''national interest'' before they can occur, though the term isn't clearly defined.
Last week, more than 40 members of Congress urged President Obama to move forward with approval, citing the benefits of free trade and the prospect of creating more jobs as demand for exports leads to growth in gas production. 
Critics pose a contrary set of arguments. They fear that demand for gas exports might encourage hydraulic fracturing, threatening water supplies, and they worry that siphoning off domestic gas for export will raise costs for domestic consumers and disadvantage American manufacturers that benefit from low-cost fuel.
There are also national security concerns. Some see an opportunity to frustrate the two biggest holders of natural gas reserves: Russia and Iran. Critics would prefer that natural gas be used to replace oil in American automobiles.
In a recent study I estimated that American firms could make up to $3 billion per year by producing and exporting liquefied natural gas. It's true that gas-dependent industries would have to pay more because of higher gas prices, but those costs would be substantially smaller than the benefits. But there are bigger stakes involved than just money. A decision to constrain natural-gas exports could have dangerous reverberations for American trade.
For example, the United States has filed with the World Trade Organization a challenge to Chinese restrictions on exports of so-called rare earth minerals, which are crucial for new technologies like wind turbines, missiles and smartphones. If Washington hypocritically limits gas exports, it might as well write the Chinese brief.
There are other problems with the opponents' arguments. To truly keep America's natural gas within our borders would require restrictions on exports to our big trade partners Canada and Mexico, and that would put the North American Free Trade Agreement at risk. Forswearing exports would also eliminate a valuable tool for American trade negotiators: countries like Japan want privileged access to United States gas, and American negotiators can seek concessions in return.
At the same time, exports would likely reduce global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the small price increases that would result from allowing exports would have at most a marginal impact on the use of natural gas as fuel for cars and trucks. Blocking exports wouldn't push natural gas into automobiles -- it would mostly keep it in the ground, because there would be less incentive to extract it.
But the critics are right to point out that exporting natural gas could increase environmental risks to communities where natural gas is extracted. Even so, a recent report from the International Energy Agency makes clear that inexpensive steps could substantially mitigate those dangers. It will take years before any export terminals are up and running -- in the meantime, producers and regulators should strengthen safeguards so that gas is extracted safely.
Exports would also raise natural gas prices a bit, adding as much as $50 to the annual electric bills for the poorest American households by the end of the decade. But the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program could help shield the most vulnerable as long as its financing is protected.
The United States, which has imported natural gas for many years, has long benefited from a relatively open system for global trade in energy. Allowing natural-gas exports while protecting the environment and low-income consumers is the right way to go.

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Rises on a Day of Light Trading

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks were mostly higher on Wednesday amid signs that the nation's economic recovery was advancing, albeit slowly.The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a loss of 7.36 points, or 0.06 percent, at 13,164.78. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 1.60 points, or 0.11 percent, at 1,405.53 and the Nasdaq composite index rose 13.95 points, or 0.46 percent, to 3,030.93.
Industrial production increased last month as factories made more cars, computers and airplanes, according to the Federal Reserve. 
It was a sign that manufacturing was recovering after a weak spring. Also, consumer prices were unchanged in July from June, as a small drop in energy costs offset slightly higher food prices. The Consumer Price Index has not changed since March, which means that inflation is in check.
Lower inflation gives the Federal Reserve more leeway to introduce programs intended to stimulate the economy. The Fed signaled at a meeting in late July that it was ready to act if growth and hiring stayed weak.
Recent reports have suggested that the economy improved somewhat in July. Employers created the most jobs in five months, while consumers spent a little more at stores after three months of declines.
Many investors wonder if the economy is fragile enough to create the sense of urgency for policy makers to act. The slightly better outlook for the economy could prompt the Fed to hold off on taking action when its policy committee next meets in September.
''We're in a period of very slow growth, though interest rates are low, and very little inflation,'' said David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. ''Unless the U.S. economy goes into a swoon and there is no pick up in retail sales and deterioration in jobs growth or major shocks from Europe and China, the Fed will not take any action for now.''
The bond market is betting that the Fed is not likely to act. Investors have been selling government bonds in recent days. On Wednesday, the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 25/32, to 98 8/32, and the yield rose to 1.82 percent from 1.73 percent late Tuesday.
In the last few weeks, trading volume in the stock market has been low. On Wednesday, the number of shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange totaled just 2.6 billion, compared with an average of four billion on an average day. Investors may also be holding off on taking aggressive positions ahead of a meeting of the Federal Reserve in Wyoming at the end of this month.
Corporate earnings have been mixed.
Target, the discount retailer, rose $1.12 to $64.50 after reporting earnings that beat analysts' expectations and raising its profit forecast for the year. Target is preparing its first expansion out of the United States, into Canada.
Deere, the farm equipment maker, fell $5.03 to $75.10 after reporting results that were well below Wall Street's expectations. The company attributed its poor results to a slowing global economy and the effects of a prolonged drought in the United States. Deere also cut its revenue forecast for the year.
Staples, the office supplies retailer, fell $1.97 to $11.49 after it said its income dropped 32 percent after weak sales in North America and Europe. The results fell short of analysts' expectations and the company cut its full-year earnings forecast.

HEADLINE: The NBC Sports Network, With an Olympics Assist, Hopes Ratings Will Rise

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
In past lives, it was called the Outdoor Life Channel, OLN and Versus. But by any name, the NBC Sports Network has been a blip in a universe dominated by ESPN.Sometimes consigned to the upper reaches of the cable listings, the network usually churns along with a low profile and modest viewership. During the London Olympic Games, however, it was temporarily transformed.
With about 14 hours of Olympic programming each day, primarily of team sports, the number of viewers swelled sixfold, to 977,000 a day, compared with the four weeks before the Games. That was an increase of 26 percent over the same period last year, providing a 17-day tonic to the ratings as special as the one CNN gets on election nights. 
The idea was to enable viewers to see NBCSN as a viable sports channel, perhaps for the first time. In past Olympics, NBC Universal farmed out team sports to USA Network.
Among all cable networks, NBCSN leapt to fifth in viewership, and it was No. 1 with viewers 18 to 49 and 25 to 54. The most-watched event was the United States women's gold medal-winning soccer match, which drew nearly 4.4 million viewers -- more than the network has drawn for any event, including the Stanley Cup Final, in its 17-year existence under various owners.
''This has exceeded all our predictions,'' Jon Miller, president of the NBC Sports Network, said last week from London. ''There's a great euphoria with the success these Olympics have generated.''
Now what? The Olympics are gone until the Winter Games from Sochi, Russia, in 2014. The network returns to reality, meaning a regular schedule that has experienced reduced prime-time viewership in 2012 compared with last year.
Part of that decrease is because of the overhaul the network began earlier this year, when its parent, the NBC Sports Group, renamed it and added new programming, like a monthly prime-time interview show with Bob Costas; a daily early evening show called NBC Sports Talk; and sports like Major League Soccer. They join existing content like the National Hockey League, motor racing, cycling, college football, boxing, horse racing, and hunting and fishing.
On Monday, the network added a weekday morning show, ''The 'Lights,'' that disdains anchor banter for an unseen male voice narrating highlights on a 20-minute loop. The show begins at 7 a.m. Eastern and is repeated five times in succession until 9 a.m. Another show, called ''Caught Looking,'' was scheduled to start Wednesday night. A collaboration with Major League Baseball Productions, the show will take a behind-the-scenes look at a specific weekend series through the rest of the baseball season.
Last month, it added a monthly magazine series -- similar to ''Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel'' on HBO and ''E:60'' on ESPN -- in partnership with Sports Illustrated.
But most of the new additions are studio shows and not the live-action sports that NBC Sports Network so desperately needs. There remain enormous gaps in its schedule. There are no Major League Baseball, National Football League or National Basketball Association games. There is no college football from major conferences. There are no Nascar races, only those from the lower-rated IndyCar series.
And there are no defining personalities among the channel's regular hosts and game announcers.
It is no surprise, then, that it charges cable, satellite and telephone companies an average monthly fee of 31 cents a subscriber compared with ESPN's $5.13, according to SNL Kagan. Depending on the time of year, NBCSN's prime-time viewership is about one-tenth to one-quarter of ESPN's.
''We all know this is a five-year plan to make it a bigger sports network,'' Mark Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Sports Group, said on Sunday. ''No one here believes, 'You did the Olympics, now we expect your ratings to go up 20 percent.' I'm hoping we get more people to sample the network.''
Mr. Lazarus has consistently kept his public expectations low and declines to speak about directly challenging ESPN. He recognizes that Olympic success is not enough to push subscriber fees higher or to justify rewriting existing contracts with cable, satellite and affiliates. NBCSN needs a stronger slate of more prominent sports to attract consistent audiences, especially males, from season to season.
Comcast, which owns NBC Universal, spent $4.38 billion to acquire the four Olympics from 2014 to 2020, but it will have to look seriously at buying some or all of the sports whose rights will soon be up for bids -- Major League Baseball, Nascar or the Big East conference, each of which would be carried on NBC's broadcast and cable networks.
Mr. Lazarus would alter his channel's economics drastically if he could acquire a slate of eight Thursday night games from the N.F.L. But the league, which carries one Thursday slate on its own NFL Network, has not decided to sell another.
''The idea is that if they can get these blockbuster events, they at least have the leverage to get higher carriage fees,'' said Brad Adgate, senior vice president of research at Horizon Media.
Peter Liguori, the former chairman of Fox Entertainment who also ran the FX cable channel, said the Olympics got NBCSN on ''people's mental menus.'' Now, he said, in addition to aggressively pursuing more sports rights, the channel ''has to give an audience something to talk about and do certain things that ESPN doesn't, either in production techniques or announcers.''
He said the network needed breakthrough programming to attract viewers, as ''The Shield'' did for FX and as HBO has done with ''Hard Knocks,'' which focuses on a single N.F.L. team in training camp.
''If you get one thing to really stand out,'' he said, ''you break down the barriers of habit.''

HEADLINE: Show and Tell for Teachers, Inspired by Reality TV

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Great teaching, it is sometimes said, is one of those things where you know it when you see it. Now, teachers in Washington will be able to see a lot more of it.In deference to a world enthralled by shows like ''Extreme Makeover'' and ''Keeping Up With the Kardashians,'' the public school district in Washington has hired a reality television company to produce videos intended to improve the skills of its teachers.
The 80 videos, 5 to 15 minutes in length, are peppered with quick jump cuts, slick screen labels and a jaunty soundtrack. In short interviews and classroom snippets, the district's highest-performing teachers demonstrate how they teach a range of lessons, from adding decimal numbers to guiding students of differing ability levels through a close reading of the Marshall Plan. 
The videos, financed by a $900,000 grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, were developed as a complement to Washington's evaluation system, known as Impact, in which teachers are judged on student test scores and classroom observations.
Through these evaluations, versions of which are being put in place across the country, teachers receive feedback on the areas where they need to improve, as well as a numerical rating. But many of Washington's teachers complained that they needed examples of the highest performing level.
''Teachers were saying to us, 'Just be very clear about what good teaching looks like,' '' said Kaya Henderson, Washington's schools chancellor.
Because teachers spend most of their days isolated in their own classrooms, they rarely get a chance to observe their peers. The videos give them a way to peek behind the closed doors of their colleagues.
''Some things are much more easily conveyed through video than just words and text,'' said Dan Cogan-Drew, director of digital learning at Achievement First, which runs nonprofit charter schools in Connecticut and New York and is among several charter groups -- including KIPP and Uncommon Schools -- that use videos for professional development.
Now, with new national curriculum standards driving teachers to modify their longstanding teaching practices, a broad range of school districts, universities, companies and nonprofits are rushing to develop online video libraries showing model teaching.
A nonprofit group allied with the New York State Department of Education is developing a series of about 200 videos demonstrating lessons aligned with the Common Core standards for reading and math that 45 states and the District of Columbia have adopted. Teaching Channel, a nonprofit, has a collection of more than 500 professionally produced videos of teachers recommended by school districts and other teacher organizations. The University of Michigan is indexing about 16,000 videos of fourth- through ninth-grade English and math teachers in six urban districts shot by researchers financed by the Gates Foundation.
Betterlesson.com, a popular sharing site for lesson plans, is working to develop a video component. And hundreds of amateur clips have been uploaded to YouTube by individual teachers.
Given this growing mountain of videos, ''as much effort needs to be put into how to use this stuff as collecting tons of it,'' said Deborah Loewenberg Ball, dean of the University of Michigan School of Education.
Education experts warn that video needs to be part of a broader program of professional development, comparing the use of video in teaching to how it is used by athletes.
A diver, for example, might want to watch clips of a top-performing competitor, said Thomas McDougal, executive director of the Lesson Study Alliance, a nonprofit education consultancy in Chicago. ''But can the diver now go into competition, ready to do that dive? No.'' Mr. McDougal said.
In Washington, evaluators and principals will recommend specific videos to teachers. Jill Nyhus, senior director of technology for the Washington schools, said principals or instructional coaches would also convene gatherings where teachers could discuss the videos.
Ms. Henderson, the chancellor, said she was initially skeptical.
''When you come home from a long day of teaching, do you want to whip out a professional development video and watch somebody else teach for 45 minutes? Heck, no,'' she said. And, she wondered, ''how do you make watching teaching sexy?''
The district hired Judith Stoia, a former producer with a PBS affiliate in Boston, and joined with Big Fish, a local independent production company, to create Reality PD (for professional development).
Jonah E. Rockoff, an economist at Columbia University who has studied teacher evaluation systems, said he was not convinced that the lowest performing teachers would ''watch a video and a light bulb goes off.'' But with extra coaching, he said, teachers in the middle range might well improve.
Dwight Davis, a fifth-grade teacher in Northeast Washington who has been rated ''effective'' three years running, said that after watching a video of Melanie Agnew, a 12th-grade English teacher at Calvin Coolidge High School, leading a class in analyzing ''The Man With the Hoe,'' a poem by Edwin Markham, he wanted to apply some of her techniques. ''I said, 'You know what? Why can't I just use this and add this and take this away?' '' he said.
But the video was just a beginning. ''I was like, 'What was your first step, and then what was your second step?' '' said Mr. Davis, who has taught for nine years. ''I really wanted to ask the teacher questions.''

HEADLINE: In Albany, Hopes of Making New York State a Yogurt Empire

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- After two hours, the Yogurt Summit ran out of spoons.Dozens of dairy farmers, food-industry executives, politicians and reporters had gathered Wednesday at a theater here for the official ''New York State Yogurt Summit,'' presided over by the state's biggest yogurt booster, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
The cutlery crisis was resolved -- backup spoons were fetched, though they were noticeably flimsier than the previous ones -- but, in a way, it reflected the reason for the gathering in the first place: these days, people have quite an appetite for yogurt. 
''This is a historic day,'' a grinning Mr. Cuomo told the crowd, which, it turned out, had quite an appetite, not just for eating yogurt, but also for talking about it. ''You can all go home and say, 'I was at the first Yogurt Summit ever in the history of the State of New York.' ''
Mr. Cuomo has been a vocal champion of the yogurt industry, in part because it has emerged as an unexpected and rare growth sector in economically struggling areas of upstate New York, and in part because it has become a reliable magnet for positive publicity. The industry has been growing because of the exploding popularity of Greek-style yogurt, which requires significantly more milk to produce than does regular yogurt, and which has benefited from a proximity to New York's dairy farms.
''Our cows are working overtime,'' said State Senator James L. Seward, an upstate Republican whose district is home to Chobani, the country's undisputed market leader in Greek-style yogurt.
State officials, billing the meeting as an opportunity to strategize with industry leaders about how to help ensure that the fast-growing industry continues to prosper, made accommodations for television trucks and offered special Yogurt Summit news media credentials, the kind of preparations more often associated with events like governors' inaugurations and State of the State addresses. No room in the governor's office was big enough to accommodate the crowd, so Mr. Cuomo's team held the gathering at the theater, called, fittingly for a meeting about a breakfast staple, the Egg.
''I would just suggest that the next Yogurt Summit be held in a building that looks like a milk bottle,'' one dairy farmer, Michael McMahon, offered.
The Cuomo administration designed a logo for the meeting, featuring a cow with a spot on its side in the shape of New York State, and the governor wore a lapel pin with the yogurt logo. The administration also commissioned a custom-made backdrop, printed with ''New York State Yogurt Summit'' in capital letters, for Mr. Cuomo and other dignitaries to sit in front of, like professional athletes at a Super Bowl news conference.
There was, naturally, plenty of yogurt -- several tubs of it, in fact, featuring New York-based industry leaders like Chobani and Fage, as well as lesser-known yogurt concerns, like Siggi's (an Icelandic-style brand made in Chenango County) and Müller (a German company that is building a plant with PepsiCo in Batavia). It was possible, if not advisable, to eat yogurt for hours on end; Mr. Cuomo is known for keeping his meeting rooms cold, so there was little risk that the yogurt would go bad.
Mr. Cuomo praised the yogurt industry's growth as ''staggering'' and ''unbelievable'': 29 yogurt plants, up from 14 in 2000; 1.2 billion pounds of milk used annually; 8,070 people employed. Chobani, for example, which started in 2005 with 5 employees, now has 1,200 in New York State.
The State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said he hoped New York would become ''the yogurt capital of the United States, if not the world.'' And Dean Norton, the president of the New York Farm Bureau, suggested yogurt could provide New York with an agricultural version of California's Silicon Valley -- the ''yogurt empire,'' in his words.
Much of the gathering was devoted to the finer points of yogurt production, like whey disposal and manure management: the president of the New York Power Authority was on hand to discuss new efforts to convert cow waste into energy.
There were, of course, concerns, as well. Darrel J. Aubertine, Mr. Cuomo's agriculture commissioner, announced that the administration would seek to encourage smaller farms to expand by increasing the herd size at which a permitting process is required to 300 cows, from 200; the change was greeted with concern by environmental groups. The meeting was also protested by people opposed to Mr. Cuomo's expected plan to allow limited hydraulic fracturing in New York, which environmentalists worry could taint groundwater; demonstrators, some dressed as cows, pleaded, ''Save our yogurt, ban fracking.''
Mr. Cuomo's joy was unfettered. He described his vision for the yogurt industry as a ''cluster economy'' that would provide a ''synergistic environment'' for all types of yogurt-related businesses.
And he offered a yogurt pep talk.
''This is a new day,'' he said of government-yogurt industry relations. ''Let's seize the moment.''

HEADLINE: Despite U.S. Fear Hezbollah Moves Openly In Europe

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Stefan Pauly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- As American officials sound the alarm over what they call a resurgent threat from the Shiite militant group Hezbollah, thousands of its members and supporters operate with few restrictions in Europe, raising money that is funneled to the group's leadership in Lebanon.Washington and Jerusalem insist that Hezbollah is an Iranian-backed terrorist organization with bloody hands, and that it is working closely with Tehran to train, arm and finance the Syrian military's lethal repression of the uprising there. Yet, the European Union continues to treat it foremost as a Lebanese political and social movement.
As Israel heightens fears of a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear sites, intelligence analysts warn that Iran and Hezbollah would respond with attacks of their own on targets abroad. Israeli and American officials have attributed the Bulgarian bus bombing last month that killed six people, including five Israeli tourists, to Hezbollah and Iran, saying it was part of a clandestine offensive that has included plots in Thailand, India, Cyprus and elsewhere. 
While the group is believed to operate all over the Continent, Germany is a center of activity, with 950 members and supporters last year, up from 900 in 2010, Germany's domestic intelligence agency said in its annual threat report. On Saturday, Hezbollah supporters and others will march here for the annual Jerusalem Day event, a protest against Israeli control of that city. Organizers told the Berlin police that the event would attract 1,000 marchers, and that two counterdemonstrations were also likely.
Hezbollah has maintained a low profile in Europe since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, quietly holding meetings and raising money that goes to Lebanon, where officials use it for an array of activities -- building schools and clinics, delivering social services and, Western intelligence agencies say, carrying out terrorist attacks.
European security services keep tabs on the group's political supporters, but experts say they are ineffective when it comes to tracking the sleeper cells that pose the most danger. ''They have real, trained operatives in Europe that have not been used in a long time, but if they wanted them to become active, they could,'' said Alexander Ritzmann, a policy adviser at the European Foundation for Democracy in Brussels, who has testified before Congress on Hezbollah.
The European Union's unwillingness to place the group on its list of terrorist organizations is also complicating the West's efforts to deal with the Bulgarian bus bombing and the Syrian conflict. The week after the attack in Bulgaria, Israel's foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, traveled to Brussels for a regular meeting with European officials, where he called for the European Union to include Hezbollah on the list. But his pleas fell on deaf ears.
''There is no consensus among the E.U. member states for putting Hezbollah in the terrorist-related list of the organizations,'' Erato Kozakou-Marcoullis, the foreign minister of Cyprus, which holds the European Union's rotating presidency, said at the time. ''Should there be tangible evidence of Hezbollah engaging in acts of terrorism, the E.U. would consider listing the organization.''
The stark difference in views reflects the many roles that Hezbollah has played since it emerged in Lebanon after the Israeli invasion in 1982. Hezbollah's militant wing was responsible for a string of kidnappings and for sophisticated bombings at home and has been accused of bombings abroad. But the group also became a source of social services that the shattered Lebanese government was incapable of providing, and has evolved since then into a political force with two cabinet ministers and a dozen seats in Parliament.
''They are quite professional in this, and this is something some Western donors are admitting that has a positive impression on some Western politicians,'' said Stephan Rosiny, a research fellow at the Institute of Middle East Studies at the German Institute of Global and Area Studies in Hamburg.
That in turn provides a rationale for the group's charitable networks among Lebanese immigrants in Europe. ''They may collect money for their institutions, but they aren't operating publicly,'' Mr. Rosiny said. ''As long as they aren't involved in politics and aren't operating openly, they are tolerated.''
From all indications to date, it is an arrangement that Hezbollah is eager to preserve. The group's secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, has said that a European blacklist would ''destroy Hezbollah. The sources of our funding will dry up and the sources of moral political and material support will be destroyed.'' And Hezbollah's defenders note that no hard evidence has been produced tying the group to the Bulgarian bus bombing.
Experts question how effectively European police officials are keeping track of the kind of serious, well-trained operatives capable of staging attacks versus counting up donors to funds for orphans of suicide bombers. ''I don't believe that they are able to monitor Hezbollah activities because Hezbollah is such a professional player,'' said Guido Steinberg, an expert on terrorism with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.
''The supporters that march the streets with a Hezbollah flag are not a threat to national security,'' Mr. Ritzmann said. ''We're more concerned with small groups -- a car dealer, a grocer, or whatever, who operate in a traditional way like a sleeper cell would operate.''
Europe has long been more tolerant of militant Islamic groups than the United States. Before the 9/11 attacks, Al Qaeda maintained a media information office in London. Much of the planning and organization for the attacks took place in Hamburg, Germany, where the plot's leader, Mohamed Atta, lived.
American officials privately complained for years about Germany's reluctance to crack down on businesses that circumvent sanctions against Iran. The pressure appears to have paid off, with Germany last year agreeing to include the European-Iranian Trade Bank, based in Hamburg, on a European Union blacklist. On Wednesday, German police officials arrested four men suspected of sending special valves to Iran for use in the building of a heavy-water reactor.
Yet, where the American and Israeli governments see Iran and Hezbollah gearing up their long-dormant capacity for international terrorism, Europeans strongly differentiate between an international terrorist network like Al Qaeda and what is viewed here as a conflict pitting Israel and the United States on one side against Iran, Syria and Hezbollah on the other.
Some analysts say that Shiite groups like Hezbollah pose less of a risk than Sunni militant organizations like Al Qaeda. ''The greatest danger from Islamist militants comes from the Salafists, not the Shiites but the Sunnis,'' said Berndt Georg Thamm, a terrorism expert in Berlin, referring to a hard-line branch of Sunni Islam. He cited as examples the man who confessed to killing seven people in southwest France this year and the gunman who killed two United States airmen at the Frankfurt airport last year. ''As far as Europe is concerned, Hezbollah is not what is moving it at the moment.''
The perception gap across the Atlantic is so great that American officials sound more concerned about the threat posed by Hezbollah to Europe than the Europeans themselves. ''We assess that Hezbollah could attack in Europe or elsewhere at any time with little or no warning,'' said Daniel Benjamin, the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, last week as officials from the Treasury and State Departments accused Hezbollah of working with operatives of Iran's Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards to train and advise Syrian government forces.
The Netherlands declared Hezbollah a terrorist organization in 2004, saying that it did not distinguish between the group's political and terrorist wings. Britain distinguishes between the parts, listing only the militant wing.
''The British see it as a tool: if you change we take it off the list,'' Mr. Ritzmann said. ''The French don't think it's smart to put them on the terrorist list because they're such a political actor.''
Mr. Thamm said, ''There is no unified common assessment of Hezbollah.'' He added, ''And that is not something that will change in the foreseeable future.''
Skeptics here in Europe say that as Hezbollah has become more political the group has moved away from its terrorist past, if not forsaken it entirely, and that Israel is stoking fears as it seeks to justify an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Some experts say that security officials on the Continent are resistant to blacklisting the group because they seem to see a tacit détente, where Hezbollah does not stage attacks and European law enforcement officials do not interfere with its fund-raising and organizational work.
''There's a fear of attracting Hezbollah's ire and eventually inviting Hezbollah operations in their own countries,'' said Bruce Hoffman, a professor of security studies at Georgetown and a terrorism expert.
''Why pick up a rock and see what's under it?'' he asked.

HEADLINE: Tapping Into the Land, And Dividing Its People

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
BLACKFEET INDIAN RESERVATION, Mont. -- The mountains along the eastern edge of Glacier National Park rise from the prairie like dinosaur teeth, their silvery ridges and teardrop fields of snow forming the doorway to one of America's most pristine places.Yes, there is beauty here on the Blackfeet reservation, but there is also oil, locked away in the tight shale thousands of feet underground. And tribal leaders have decided to tap their land's buried wealth. The move has divided the tribe while igniting a debate over the promise and perils of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, in a place where grizzlies roam into backyards and many residents see the land as something living and sacred.
All through the billiard-green mesas leading up to the mountains are signs of the boom. Well pads and water tanks dot the rolling hills. Tractor-trailers loaded with chemicals and drilling machinery kick up contrails of dust along the reservation's winding gravel roads. And spirelike drilling rigs quietly bore into the ground, silhouetted against mountains with names like Sinopah, Rising Wolf and Chief.
It is an increasingly common sight for tribes across the West and Plains: Tourist spending has gone slack since the recession hit. American Indian casino revenues are stagnating just as tribal gambling faces new competition from online gambling and waves of new casinos. Oil and fracking are new lifelines. 
One drilling rig on the Blackfeet reservation generated 49 jobs for tribal members -- a substantial feat in a place where unemployment is as high as 70 percent. But as others watched the rigs rise, they wondered whether the tribe was making an irrevocable mistake.
''These are our mountains,'' said Cheryl Little Dog, a recently elected member of the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council, the reservation's governing body. ''I look at what we have, and I think, why ruin it over an oil rig?''
Oil exploration here began in the 1920s, largely on the plains along the eastern edge of the reservation, but it died off in the early 1980s. Over the last four years, though, new fracking technologies and rising oil prices have lured the drillers back, and farther and farther west, to the mountains that border Glacier National Park.
Oil companies have leased out the drilling rights for a million of the reservation's 1.5 million acres, land held by the tribe, according to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. They have drilled 30 exploratory wells this year alone, and are already engaged in fracking many of them, pumping a slurry of water, sand and chemicals to crack open underground rock beds to pry out the oil.
''It'll change the lives of a lot of people,'' said Grinnell Day Chief, the tribe's oil and gas manager. ''It'll be a boost to everybody. There's talk of a hotel coming up.''
To tribal leaders, oil wealth could be more lucrative and reliable than any casino -- a resource whose royalties could transform a reservation scarred by poverty and alcoholism.
Blackfeet elders say they have already collected about $30 million, primarily from three oil companies, the Anschutz Exploration Corporation, the Newfield Exploration Company and Rosetta Resources. The tribe has used signing bonuses to pay off debts from building the Glacier Peaks Casino. It built a tribe-owned grocery to compete with the IGA in Browning, the reservation's largest town. The tribe's approximately 16,500 members each got $200 in trickle-down payments from the drilling last year, and the oil companies have donated money to the local basketball team and to buy children toys and jackets last Christmas.
For some on the reservation, the drills cannot come soon enough. In April, T. J. Show, then the chairman of the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council, told a House committee that the layers of oversight and paperwork needed to drill into tribal lands were ''extremely slow and burdensome.'' He told the panel he opposed new federal rules that would clamp down on fracking and chase away oil companies.
To find the opposing view, one needs only to drive five miles west from Browning, past the casino, heading straight toward the mountains, and pull off at the red gate on the right. There, on a recent summer afternoon, over mugs of horsemint tea, Pauline Matt and a handful of Blackfeet women were trying to find a way to persuade the tribal leaders to stop the drilling.
''It threatens everything we are as Blackfeet,'' she said.
Other environmental activists around Glacier have raised concerns that the fracking operations, if they continue and expand, could pollute air quality, contaminate sensitive watersheds and tarnish a night almost uncontaminated by man-made lights.
Chas Cartwright, the superintendent of Glacier National Park, has asked for a full-scale environmental review of drilling on the reservation. In a July 31 letter to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, he raised concerns about how drilling might affect grizzly bear populations, air quality and the vistas from mountain perches inside the park.
And the tribe's environmental office and roads department have already noted damage to the roads, and small chemical and fuel spills.
The divisions within the tribe are more than disputes over the economy and environment -- they represent two visions of the land where Blackfeet members have lived for centuries.
Ms. Matt and the women who oppose the fracking speak about the streams and meadows and mountains as if they were family members. They go on vision quests in the mountains. They braid native sweetgrass to burn in prayers and collect berries and herbs for food, medicine and ceremonies.
The drilling companies, the local Bureau of Land Management and tribal officials say there has been no evidence that the fracking has affected the reservation's water supplies or soured its air. But to opponents, the damage to the land is still being done.
''You see this butterfly, you hear those birds?'' asked Crystal LaPlant, as she sat on Ms. Matt's back porch one evening, the meadows alive with sound. ''Once they start drilling, we aren't going to have those things anymore.''
Ron Crossguns, who works for the Blackfeet tribe's oil and gas division, has oil leases on his land, a 10-foot cross in his yard, and little patience for that kind of pastoral veneration. He called it ''movie Indian'' claptrap, divorced from modern realities. Mountains, he said, are just mountains.
''They're just big rocks, nothing more,'' Mr. Crossguns said. ''Don't try to make them into nothing holy. Jesus Christ put them there for animals to feed on, and for people to hunt on.''
And maybe, for people to drill into. Whether the oil companies keep drilling may depend less on the tribe's attitudes than the raw economics of extracting oil from extremely tight rock formations. The oil companies are still taking samples, analyzing the rocks and trying to figure out whether they can turn a profit.
''The earth is saturated with oil,'' Dave Loken, a senior geologist with Anschutz, said at a recent meeting of tribal leaders and oil companies to discuss the future of drilling on the Blackfeet land. ''It's very tough to get the oil out. We're still working on it.''

HEADLINE: A Mannah of Speaking in Retreat

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
Mitt Romney drew some criticism on the campaign trail last spring when he wrestled over the pronunciation of ''Missouri.'' But some residents of the New England state where he spends his vacations, according to a recent study, have become increasingly uncertain how to pronounce ''New Hampshire.''It used to be that people east of the Green Mountains, which run through the middle of Vermont, reliably called it ''New Hampsha.'' But in ''Farewell to the Founders: Major Dialect Changes Along the East-West New England Border,'' a paper in the current issue of the journal American Speech, three linguists show that the line separating those who drop their R's from those who don't has moved to the east, to the Vermont-New Hampshire border -- and, in the case of young people, has even encroached deep into the New Hampshire itself. 
And it isn't just a matter of ''non-rhoticity,'' the technical name for the speech pattern that makes people ''pahk the cah in Hahvahd yahd.'' The study's authors -- James N. Stanford, Thomas A. Leddy-Cecere and Kenneth P. Baclawski Jr. -- also discovered an erosion of several other distinctive features of eastern New England speech, including the different vowels for ''father'' and ''bother'' and for ''Mary,'' ''merry'' and ''marry.'' (The distinction between ''horse'' and ''hoarse,'' however, seems to be hanging on.)
''After so many generations of consistent transmission'' traceable to 18th-century settlers, the authors declare, ''the social patterns laid down by the Founders are now rapidly shifting and dissipating in the current generation.''
The east-west distinction in northern New England speech was first described in the 1939 Linguistic Atlas of New England and held firm in a 1987 study based on data gathered in the 1960s for the Dictionary of American Regional English. But during the past decade the current study's authors -- all of whom have long roots in New England -- began noting that they heard the distinction less reliably and set out to investigate.
Aided by a team of students from Dartmouth, they began by doing two sets of interviews: first with 39 elderly people from across New Hampshire and Vermont, and another with 23 young and old speakers in Claremont, N.H., near the Vermont border. Participants were asked to read a list of words and sentences along with part of a text called ''How to Survive a New England Winter.''
After careful acoustical analysis, the authors arrived at a clear conclusion: The east-west speech border had moved from the Green Mountains to the Vermont-New Hampshire border, and among the young it seemed close to vanishing altogether. Some of the change, the authors suggest, is deliberate, as people seek to avoid the stigma of sounding like they come from the ''backwoods'' -- or perhaps worse, Boston. Asked whether she ever dropped R's or used other eastern New England variants, one young Claremont woman told the researchers, ''Only when mocking someone from Massachusetts.''
The study is not without its political implications. The emergence of the rhotic R in New Hampshire, the researchers suggest, may reflect the spread of the ''Live Free or Die'' mentality that has crept north as refugees from ''Taxachusetts'' seek linguistic as well as economic independence. But the survival of more subtle eastern dialect features like the horse/hoarse distinction, the authors write, may also reflect an emerging ''modern northern New Englander identity'' untethered to traditional rural culture.
As Mr. Leddy-Cecere, a New England native now teaching at the University of Texas, is quoted as saying in the paper: ''I'm not an Old Vermonter. But I'm not a flatlander either. I'm a Vermonter.'' JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

HEADLINE: Private Equity Firm Continues Its Busy Summer for Deals

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
While summer has traditionally been a slow time for deal making, the Carlyle Group has been on a buying spree in recent weeks.The buyout firm said on Wednesday that it would buy Getty Images, the big provider of high-quality images and video, from another private equity shop for $3.3 billion. It was the second major buyout that Carlyle announced in the last week, after the takeover of the TCW Group, a Los Angeles-based investment manager, from Société Générale of France.
The two leveraged buyouts are only the latest in a string of recent deals by Carlyle. That list includes taking control of Sunoco's huge Philadelphia refinery and buying a stake in Genesee & Wyoming, a railroad operator that is buying a smaller rival. 
The firm has struck 19 deals worth nearly $14.1 billion over the last 12 months and currently tops the Thomson Reuters rankings of acquisitions by private equity firms.
By contrast, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, another major buyout firm, announced nine deals worth $9.2 billion during the same period, and Bain Capital reported eight deals valued at $4.7 billion. The Blackstone Group disclosed nine deals worth $1.2 billion.
While coincidental - many of the deals have been in the works for months - Carlyle's activity this summer belies a generally slow time for private equity firms. Deal making in general has been hampered by economic uncertainty, which also limited growth in the value of buyout firms' holdings.
Carlyle has not been immune to the industrywide malaise. Last week, the firm announced that it had a $57 million loss in its second quarter, burdened by slow growth in its investments.
Yet even then, executives stressed that they saw opportunities. The firm pointed to $3 billion in realized gains during the quarter, as well as nearly $4 billion in new capital.
William E. Conway, a co-chief executive of Carlyle, has said that a volatile market could unearth interesting bargains for his firm. That has been a common refrain among many buyout executives, who argue that their vast stores of uninvested capital and a potential rise in undervalued companies could only help propel deal making.
"Great investments can be made in a bad economy and lousy investments can be made in a vibrant economy," Mr. Conway said last week on the firm's earnings call with analysts. "Notwithstanding weaker global economic conditions, we see good investing opportunities across our platform."
So far, it appears that Carlyle is carrying through on that promise.
Over all, Carlyle has committed about $5.5 billion in equity capital from its various investment funds for new deals this year.
Executives at the firm said that such a pace is not unusual. Carlyle is one of the largest in the industry, with more than 99 investment funds and 1,300 professionals around the world.
The six deals that the firm announced since July came from five different vehicles. The Getty deal was struck from one of its main United States buyout funds, Carlyle Partners V, while the Sunoco transaction was made from the firm's Equity Opportunity and Energy Mezzanine Opportunities funds.
"There's been no big shift in our mind-set that now is a good time to deploy capital," Peter J. Clare, a co-head of Carlyle's United States buyouts group, said in a telephone interview. "It's more a reflection of the depth of our industry teams and the capital of our funds."
The Getty deal arose out of an auction that the image provider's current owner, the buyout firm Hellman & Friedman, began running several months ago.
Over all, executives expect the Carlyle's main American buyout fund, which has $13.7 billion under management, to reach a general investment target of about 20 percent of its available capital.
"We're right on track for what I'd call an average year in terms of equity investment from the U.S. buyout fund," Mr. Clare said.
With debt financing relatively cheap at the moment and with more companies willing to sell themselves, Carlyle executives said that the firm has simply benefited from more opportunities, without lowering the benchmarks for its investments.
"We're holding to the same standards," Mr. Clare said. "But more companies coming to the market is putting more opportunities in front of us."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Nellie Gray, 88, Abortion Foe and Leader of Annual March

BYLINE: By DENISE GRADY

 BODY:
Nellie Gray, a steadfast opponent of abortion who for almost 40 years led a yearly protest march in Washington that drew tens of thousands of supporters, and whose battle cry was ''No exception! No compromise!,'' was found dead on Monday at her home in Washington. She was 88.Her death was announced by the March for Life Education and Defense Fund, an anti-abortion group that she founded in 1974 and ran from her home. She was its president at her death. A board member of the group, Gene Ruane, said Wednesday that the cause had not been determined.
Ms. Gray, a lawyer in the Labor Department, was galvanized by Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that established a woman's right to abortion. She retired from her legal career and devoted the rest of her life to overturning that decision. 
''It was such a shock to think that anyone would kill an innocent human being,'' she told a television interviewer. To allow abortion, she said, was out of character for a nation that had recently passed civil rights laws and had helped at the Nuremberg trials to convict Nazis of crimes against humanity.
A Roman Catholic, Ms. Gray believed that life began at fertilization, and that abortion was murder and not acceptable for any reason: not for rape or incest, for severe abnormalities in the fetus or to save the woman's life.
She joined forces with other abortion opponents, and together they devised a plan for a march in Washington. The first march took place at the Capitol on Jan. 22, 1974, the anniversary of Roe v. Wade. The March for Life group was formed later that year, with the purpose of overturning the ruling. Year after year, tens of thousands braved the cold, and sometimes snow or rain, to participate in the march.
Ms. Gray, slight, animated and articulate, with thick, curly hair and traces of her Texas roots in her speech, would rally the crowds by denouncing ''feminist abortionists,'' comparing abortion to the Holocaust and crying, ''Save the babies!'' In recent years she invited women who felt they had been harmed by abortion to participate in the marches and to hold up signs saying they regretted their abortions.
She bent for no one. In 1979, when Eleanor Smeal, president of the National Organization for Women, suggested that groups for and against legal abortion should meet and try to find common ground, like promoting birth control, Ms. Gray refused, saying, ''Pro-life people will not negotiate with baby killers.''
After the 1981 march, attended by 60,000 people, President Ronald Reagan agreed to receive an anti-abortion delegation at the White House. But Ms. Gray refused to attend, saying she thought the president should have addressed the rally.
In 1987 she rescinded an award that her group had given to Dr. C. Everett Koop, the surgeon general, because she disapproved of his explicit talk about sex and his advocating the use of condoms to prevent the spread of AIDS. Ms. Gray believed that recommending birth control encouraged teenagers to have sex and made them ''fodder for the abortion mills,'' as she put it.
''She really stuck to her beliefs and didn't care what people thought,'' said Jeanne Monahan, who is the interim president of March for Life's board of directors and a director at the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group. ''And yet she had a real graciousness about her as well.''
Ms. Gray was born in Big Spring, Tex., on June 24, 1924. Her father was an auto mechanic, and she told The New York Times in 1981 that her childhood had been ''economically debilitated.''
After high school, she worked as a secretary for a year to raise money for college, then enrolled at Texas State College for Women in 1941. After the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor that year, she joined the Women's Army Corps. She finished college after the war under the G.I. Bill, earning a bachelor's degree in business administration and a master's in economics. She received a law degree in 1959 from Georgetown University, which she attended at night.
No immediate family members survive.
Ms. Gray was active in her organization until the end. The Rev. Frank Pavone, the national director of Priests for Life, posted on the organization's Web site an e-mail message that he said she had sent him just days ago. It read in part, ''We shall unify and stop the evil of abortion because it is evil.''

HEADLINE: In Spain, Opposition to a Casino Plan

BYLINE: By RAPHAEL MINDER

 BODY:
MADRID -- The legal troubles of the American casino mogul Sheldon G. Adelson in the United States and Macau are fueling opposition to his plans to build a casino and leisure resort in Madrid or Barcelona.On Wednesday, a Catalan environmental party, ICV-EUiA, called on Mr. Adelson to appear before the Catalonian Parliament to explain why some of his company's activities in Macau have run into legal problems in the United States.
Mr. Adelson's company, Las Vegas Sands, is being investigated by the U.S. authorities on suspicion of violating anti-bribery laws linked to its expansion in Macau, the Chinese gambling capital and a major source of income for the Sands. The company has denied wrongdoing and has said the investigation stems from the accusations of a disgruntled former employee. The Chinese authorities have also been investigating some of the company's activities. 
Jaume Bosch, a lawmaker from the Catalan Green Party, expressed concern that the Spanish authorities had recently welcomed Mr. Adelson, a billionaire, ''like a head of state, while the most powerful countries in the world have placed him under suspicion.''
In the United States, Mr. Adelson's preference for working below the radar has been tested this year as he has emerged as the largest donor to the Republican Party in the presidential campaign, in which he has pledged to spend up to $100 million to defeat President Barack Obama. This week, just days after the presumptive Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, named him as his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan traveled to Las Vegas to meet Mr. Adelson for what an aide to Mr. Romney called ''a finance event.''
In recent months, plans by Las Vegas Sands to build a giant casino complex in Spain have created a bidding battle between the two biggest cities in the country. Officials are eager to attract development while Spain is in the midst of its second recession in three years, with record unemployment of almost 25 percent. The government is struggling to convince investors that the country will not sink deeper into crisis and require a full European bailout.
Mr. Adelson and other Sands executives have made several visits to possible building sites in Madrid and Barcelona. The two cities also recently sent delegations to Las Vegas in a bid to win over company executives. The Sands wants the complex, which it plans to call EuroVegas, to have 12 hotels with a total of 36,000 rooms, six casinos with 18,000 slot machines and three golf courses.
Esperanza Aguirre, the head of Madrid's regional government, has urged the national government to meet concessions requested by Mr. Adelson, including some tax exemptions, as well as an easing of Spanish restrictions on smoking in public spaces. Ms. Aguirre's request, however, has led to questions over whether granting special treatment to the Sands would open the door to similar concessions for other investors.
While a final decision was initially expected before the summer, the Sands has pushed back any announcement until September. The Sands still hopes to start construction in mid-2013 and complete the complex within 10 years, according to Michael A. Leven, the company's president. Mr. Leven said in June at a news conference in Barcelona that the decision to build a casino complex in Spain should not be compared to ''a soccer match between Madrid and Barcelona.''
Still, some Spanish politicians are acutely aware that the longstanding rivalry between the two cities is helping the politically savvy Mr. Adelson.
''It has worked great for him to have two cities competing so fiercely, with everybody trying to make the maximum efforts to meet his wishes,'' Xavier Trias, the mayor of Barcelona, said this year. ''But if he thinks the European casino model can become the same as in China or Vegas, I think that he is wrong because there are laws here that really cannot and shouldn't be changed.''
As an example, Mr. Trias said, ''In Vegas you can cross a casino to a hotel room with children, but that isn't possible here.''
Some civic groups oppose plans for EuroVegas on environmental grounds. Other opponents say they fear that by promoting gambling, Spain might spur criminal activities like prostitution and money laundering.
''Our politicians are presenting this as a project that will save us from the economic crisis, but they're ignoring several reasons why this goes against what this country should push for,'' said Sonia Pomares, a member of Aturem EuroVegas, or Stop EuroVegas, a protest association formed this year in Catalonia.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Young Illegal Immigrants Jump at a First Chance

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON; Steven Yaccino contributed reporting from Chicago, Fernanda Santos from Phoenix, and Kirk Semple from New York.

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Tens of thousands of young illegal immigrants waited excitedly in lines as long as a mile and thronged to information sessions across the country on Wednesday, the first day that a federal immigration agency began accepting applications for deportation deferrals that include permits to work legally.The public outpouring surprised both federal officials and immigrant advocates, who had expected an enthusiastic response to the Obama administration's deferral program but were unprepared for the size and intensity of it. At Navy Pier here, young people began lining up on Tuesday evening for a counseling session about the program that was organized by an immigrants' rights group.
By midmorning Wednesday, the line wound down the long pier, through a park and along an expressway, with young people holding sheafs of documents that they hoped would prove that they qualified for the program. By noon, event organizers said, 11,500 people had attended briefings, and more than 2,000 people had been turned away because there was not enough time or staff to deal with them. 
''I know that out there many people are looking for the same thing as I am,'' said Reyna Martinez, 19, who has lived in the United States since she was 7. ''We are not alone; we stand together as a big crowd.''
Thousands of immigrants also waited in lines outside the offices of immigrants' groups and flooded churches and law offices in Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Boston and Houston, among other cities.
Many of the young immigrants waiting at Navy Pier were wary -- the program does not provide any legal immigration status like a green card, and some would-be applicants worried that there was a risk in coming forward so publicly -- but they said any progress toward a legal foothold in the United States would be worth it.
''I know there are a lot of people without documentation who want to continue their school and work and make a better life for their families,'' said Darinca Barron, 17, who added that she was brought here by her parents from Mexico when she was 6. ''This is just a chance that you have to take.''
Under the program, the federal government will grant a two-year reprieve from deportation to illegal immigrants who are under age 31, have been in this country since they were children and meet other requirements.
President Obama initiated the program on June 15 using his executive authority. He did so after legislation known as the Dream Act -- which he supported and which would have given legal status to young immigrants -- stalled in Congress. He made broad use of his presidential powers, with as many as 1.7 million immigrants estimated to be eligible for deferrals.
The agency managing the program, Citizenship and Immigration Services, had only 60 days to prepare for the deluge of paperwork. The application form was first published on the Internet on Tuesday afternoon. Officials at the agency said on Wednesday that no major problems had been reported.
Immigrants must mail in the applications, which include a request for the deportation deferral and separate forms for a work permit. Agency officials and immigrant advocates have warned young people that there will be no appeals of applications that are denied, so they should have all their documents in order.
As a result, few applications were submitted on Wednesday. Most immigrants who turned out were seeking guidance about whether they would be eligible and what documents they needed to prove that they met the requirements. At the session at Navy Pier -- famous for its Ferris wheel -- organizers from the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights set up rows of tables in a ballroom where dozens of lawyers and volunteers offered free individual counseling.
Three prominent Illinois Democrats, all longtime supporters of the Dream Act, gathered at Navy Pier to mingle with the young immigrants and reap some of the political benefits from Mr. Obama's initiative.
One of them, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, wrote the original Dream Act bill 11 years ago. Mr. Durbin, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat, said he was elated to see the huge crowd. ''You can't stop this force,'' Mr. Durbin said to applause from the immigrants. ''This is a force of people who have grown up in this country and want to be part of its future. They are creating a moral force beyond a legal force.''
Another of the Democrats, Representative Luis Gutierrez, compared the scene at Navy Pier to the immigrants arriving at Ellis Island a century ago. ''While they saw New York City then, today they see Chicago,'' he said.
The third Democrat, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who was Mr. Obama's White House chief of staff, announced that the city had raised $275,000 in private donations for a college scholarship fund for immigrants who were granted deferrals. Mr. Emanuel pressed home his political point.
''Don't let anybody tell you on a day like today that who sits in that Oval Office does not matter,'' he said. Obama campaign strategists had hoped that halting the deportations would help the president among Hispanics, whose votes could be pivotal in several states.
Republicans have criticized the deportation deferrals as a form of backdoor amnesty for immigrants who broke the law. They say the effort to give work permits to so many of them is poorly timed, with the unemployment rate at more than 8 percent.
Some states greeted the initiative with less enthusiasm than Illinois. In Arizona, Gov. Jan Brewer, issued an executive order on Wednesday barring immigrants who are granted a reprieve from getting public benefits or obtaining drivers' licenses.
She instructed state agencies to carry out whatever changes were necessary to safeguard ''the intent of Arizona voters and lawmakers,'' who have passed laws and approved ballot initiatives that prevent anyone other than legal residents from accessing taxpayer-financed benefits.
In New York, the City Council announced that it had set aside $3 million to provide free legal services to deferral applicants through a network of community organizations.
''The City Council has made this investment because we believe that undocumented immigrants have a right to an education and a safe and productive life here in the U.S.,'' Speaker Christine C. Quinn said.

HEADLINE: Choice of Ryan Shifts the Focus From Economy

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY; Allison Kopicki contributed research.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Four years ago, John Brooks cast his ballot for Barack Obama, becoming one of the voters won over by his promise for changing Washington. This time, he had been undecided, but he said Mitt Romney made his decision easier by placing Representative Paul D. Ryan on the Republican ticket.The choice pushed him back to President Obama, said Mr. Brooks, 43, a sales manager at a Chevrolet dealership, who said that until now he had thought Mr. Romney was really a moderate, and he had been open to voting for him before he picked a running mate whose views on the budget he found extreme.
''Romney and someone else could have been a great team,'' Mr. Brooks said Wednesday, a day after meeting the president at a restaurant in Cedar Falls, Iowa, during a stop on Mr. Obama's three-day bus tour of the state. 
The selection of Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, has energized the party's base and brought fresh enthusiasm and bigger crowds to the Romney campaign. It also has awakened casual Democratic voters like Mr. Brooks who recoil at a Republican budget and tax policy they see as unfair to the middle class.
But the past several days have also brought evidence of a subtle but broad strategic shift by Mr. Romney, one that many Congressional Republicans are concerned could divert attention from job creation, the issue they think will work best for the party.
In the midst of an election in which few voters have not already taken sides, he is now running a campaign more focused on energizing an anti-Obama coalition than on trying to expand the universe of Romney voters with an argument that he is the most qualified economic steward.
Mr. Obama has been responding in kind, opening a deeply divisive period in the race in which firing up hard-core partisans is taking priority over trying to pursue relatively small numbers of undecided voters in the middle. This week has unfolded in a series of harsh exchanges between the candidates, with the president mocking his rival's character, and Mr. Romney accusing Mr. Obama of disgracing the presidency by waging a ''campaign of division and anger and hate.''
Persuasion, especially on the Republican side, has given way to partisan stimulation. A sharp focus on the economy is giving way to ideology and personality.
For months, Mr. Romney tried making inroads among voters who were disappointed with, but not necessarily angry at, Mr. Obama. Republican groups have run television advertisements taking a softer approach by telling voters to feel no guilt for not supporting Mr. Obama.
Yet after a summer of pummeling from Democrats, Mr. Romney is returning the scorching fire in hopes of expanding his support among Republicans who more than anything want to turn Mr. Obama out of office in November.
The traditional balance between motivating core supporters without scaring off independent voters may be different in this election cycle, strategists in both parties say, because such a small share of people are truly independent and potentially open to either candidate. A series of recent polls in six swing states showed that only 5 percent of voters were undecided and only about 1 in 10 likely voters who had chosen a candidate said they were open to switching.
At this point four years ago, more than 1 in 4 voters nationwide said they might change their minds.
''There is a smaller slice of undecided voters out there than usual,'' said Joel Benenson, the chief pollster for the president's re-election campaign.
Republicans, he said, ''may think that their only chance of winning this is by maximizing their base, but I don't believe this election is a base election.''
For Mr. Obama, there is probably more of an opportunity to capture some moderate voters who oppose the direction that Mr. Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, and other House Republicans have moved in. But Mr. Obama still has to persuade some centrists that he can be trusted with the deficit and the economy and that he is not culturally out of step with them.
The strategic shifts by the candidates mirror a bigger change in the nature of the race. It is no longer solely a referendum on the economic record of Mr. Obama; rather, on the choice of approaches over the future of Medicare, the popular health insurance program for retirees, and the role and scope of government.
The Romney campaign is testing whether it can expand the successful Republican coalition from 2010, when the party, on the basis of an anti-Obama and very conservative message, won control of the House and expanded its strength at all levels of government. It is not simply a base strategy, aides said, but a plan to capitalize on the rejection of Mr. Obama's approach that they say is coursing through the country.
''We're going to be able to make a very compelling argument to people in the middle that we need a change and Obama isn't the change they signed up for,'' said Neil Newhouse, the pollster for Mr. Romney. ''When you really probe, people are upset with spending, the deficit and the debt. It goes beyond jobs and the economy, and there is a sense things are out of control.''
For Mr. Romney, several benefits of selecting Mr. Ryan have already become clear. He has finally drawn praise from conservatives, including those who have long been tepid. And he has become a stronger and more confident campaigner with a partner at his side, advisers say, who has an easygoing style that could help improve Mr. Romney's connection to voters.
The Romney campaign is taking pains to track down and quash any criticism in Republican circles about any potential downsides of Mr. Ryan on the ticket, including that the campaign debate over Medicare is fraught with risk for other candidates in the party.
Interviews with nearly a dozen Republicans on Congressional and Senate campaigns said in near unison that they worried that the economic focus of the race had been overshadowed.
It is a question that may not be answered until Election Day. Will a surge of conservative enthusiasm for the Republican ticket outweigh any potential falloff among voters who supported Mr. Obama in 2008 and are open to changing their minds this year?
Mr. Brooks, the Iowa man who had counted himself in that category, said his mind was made up before Mr. Obama unexpectedly stopped by his table at the Pump Haus restaurant in downtown Cedar Falls on Tuesday.
''We had no idea he was showing up,'' he said. ''We really didn't talk politics.''

HEADLINE: City Picks Philadelphia Firm to Reopen Tavern on the Green

BYLINE: JULIA MOSKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Emerald Green Group, which runs the Philadelphia restaurant Beau Monde, plans to reopen the space as a smaller, more rustic spot in 2013. 

 BODY:
More than two years after the legendary Central Park restaurant Tavern on the Green closed and its once-luxurious appointments were auctioned off, the parks department has selected a new, Philadelphia-based operator that plans to reopen the space as a smaller, more rustic restaurant in the fall of 2013.
"The hope is that it will not be only a destination, but a place that will serve the neighborhood and locals who use the park every day," said Katy Sparks, the new executive chef, who has worked in New York City since the 1980s.
Although the footprint of the restaurant will be smaller than the final incarnation of the old Tavern on the Green, there will, nonetheless, be room for 300 guests inside, an additional 200 to 300 outside and a takeout window selling smoothies, sandwiches and picnic fare.
The new operator, the Emerald Green Group, runs the Philadelphia restaurant Beau Monde, a popular bistro with 70 seats. Its principals, Jim Caiola and David Salama, are both chefs. Since her last restaurant closed in 2002, Ms. Sparks, who is known for her clean, New American culinary style, has been working as a consultant, developing local and sustainable menus for restaurants and companies like Sodexo.
About a half-dozen companies bid for the chance to develop a restaurant, including Legends Hospitality Management, which runs the Legends Suite Club and all food catering at Yankee Stadium; City Winery, a restaurant in downtown Manhattan for lovers of wine and music; and Park Street Ventures, an investment partnership in Essex Fells, N.J.
But New York's high-powered restaurateurs did not submit proposals, a reflection of the building's condition, the challenges of working with the city government, early disputes over the ownership of the lease and the restaurant's name, and parks department limitations on catered events. 
"I think the city really wanted to redefine what the Tavern is going to be," said Drew Nieporent, who was the director of Tavern on the Green from 1978 to 1982, when it was a prime destination for parties and celebrities. "They don't want private events. They don't want music. They want something that will blend in, not stand out."
A parks department spokesman, Philip Abramson, confirmed that the city's goal for the site was to provide an informal, accessible restaurant that would harmonize with its bucolic setting. To that end, Ms. Sparks said, her menu will draw extensively on local farms and products: squid from Montauk, foie gras from the Hudson Valley and chocolate made by the Mast Brothers of Brooklyn.
The city, not the Emerald Green Group, is paying the nearly $10 million bill for the structural and exterior work that will restore the building to its original design. It was built by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould in the 19th century as a sheepfold for the 200 sheep that grazed in the Sheep Meadow nearby. As parks commissioner in the 1930s, Robert Moses converted the building into a (low-earning) restaurant, and in the 1970s, the impresario Warner LeRoy transformed it into a glittering, rococo showpiece. But business faltered in the economic downturn of the past several years; the Crystal Room, which was built over the original building's courtyard, was dismantled in 2010.
The group has a signed letter of agreement with the restaurant workers' union, the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, the first step toward a contract. Negotiations with the union, among other factors, derailed the first operator awarded the contract for the Tavern: Dean J. Poll, who runs the Boathouse restaurant nearby.
Stephen Starr, who operates large restaurants in Philadelphia, New York and Florida, said he was surprised by the city's choice of the operator of a small bistro. "It's a daunting task, to go from 70 to 600 seats, but you never know," he said. "Rocky beat Apollo Creed in the end."

HEADLINE: Asian Identity and the Global Economy

BYLINE: CHRYSTIA FREELAND


HIGHLIGHT: The Chinese-American author and star of a new movie that tackles globalization and high finance has talked about the wide varieties of Asian identity, and the general western tendency to lump all Asians into a single category. 

 BODY:
Last month I finished writing "Plutocrats," a book on the rise of the global super-elite and the forces that created it, so I am somewhat obsessed with globalization, bankers and the like. That's why those themes in a new indie movie, "Supercapitalist," resonated most strongly for me.
The film is indeed an entertaining exploration of these issues. But for viewers less focused on money and how it flows around the world, an equally fascinating aspect of "Supercapitalist" is what it has to say about the fluidity of identity in a globalized economy.
As I write in my latest column, the film's screenwriter and lead actor is a Chinese-American, Derek Ting, and it is largely set in Hong Kong. 
One point it makes elegantly is that the same Chinese-Americans who feel strongly Chinese when they are home in the United States stand out even more starkly as American when they go to China.
In conversation, Mr. Ting touched on another point: the wide varieties of Asian identity, and the general western tendency to lump all Asians into a single category.
Mr. Ting realizes perfectly well that Asia contains multitudes. In a talk with the audience after an East Village screening, he described his difficult decision to cast a Vietnamese actress in the lead female role of a Cantonese and English-speaking Hong Kong native. It wasn't a perfect fit, but Mr. Ting chose to go with the most talented thespian.
Not everyone is as discerning. Talking about the wave of Asian Americans who are heading to the booming east, Mr. Ting told the story of one friend: 
"The guy who helped me construct the initial, financial parts of the story, he was working at Citibank and they said, 'You look Asian, go to Hong Kong'. He was Korean." 
No harm done, though - his friend ended up starting his own hedge fund.

HEADLINE: City's Unemployment Rate Remains at 10 Percent

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A loss of about 17,000 jobs in July did not change the unemployment rate, which matches the highest rate of unemployment the city had throughout the recession. 

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate remained as high last month as it ever was during the long recession that officially ended more than three years ago: 10 percent.
That is the latest word on the state of the city's job market from the New York State Department of Labor. On Thursday, the Labor Department said that the number of jobs in New York City declined by about 17,000 in July, a decline that was smaller than the usual drop-off in employment in midsummer.
But that relatively small loss did not change the city's unemployment rate, which had risen to 10 percent in June. That level matches the highest rate of unemployment the city had throughout the recession set off by the financial crisis in 2007.
The numbers were skewed somewhat by the temporary lockout of about 8,000 unionized employees of Consolidated Edison, the utility company. Those workers returned to their jobs at the end of the month.
City and state officials have said that the unemployment rate has been rising because people have flooded into the New York job market encouraged about their prospects for finding work. But the results of the latest survey of city households suggest that those job-seekers are not finding work: the numbers indicate that there were almost as many city residents employed in July as there had been a year before. Over the same period, though, the number of unemployed city residents rose by more than 42,000, pushing the unemployment rate up a full percentage point, from 9 percent in July 2011.
The persistently high unemployment rate seems to contradict the relatively strong increases in payrolls reported by employers. Those numbers, which come from a separate survey, show that employment in the city's private sector rose by more than 72,000 jobs, or 2.2 percent, in the 12 months through July. That was a faster rate of growth than the 1.8 percent increase for the nation as a whole during that period.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: Cisco, a Tech Bellwether, Beats Forecasts

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Cisco Systems, the world's largest maker of computer networking equipment, delivered quarterly results on Wednesday that slightly surpassed Wall Street's expectations, Steve Lohr reports in Thursday's New York Times. 

 BODY:
 Cisco Systems, the world's largest maker of computer networking equipment, delivered quarterly results on Wednesday that slightly surpassed Wall Street's expectations, and Wall Street is responding positively on Thursday. 
At mid-morning, Cisco stock was up $1.42, or about 8 percent, at $18.77. 
As Steve Lohr explains in Thursday's New York Times, the company's routers and switches shuttle data around corporate data centers and across the Internet, so its results are a sign of the strength of investment in the engine rooms of the digital economy.
In a conference call on Wednesday, John T. Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, said he saw improvement in the United States market, especially toward the end of the quarter. But he cautioned that it was "way too early to call this a trend." While orders were strong in Asia, especially in China, he said, they were falling in Europe and would most likely fall further.
Cisco was encouraged enough by its results to sharply increase its quarterly dividend payment 75 percent, to 14 cents a share, up from 8 cents.
Cisco reports its financial results in quarters that close a month later than the period used by most companies, so it sometimes gains an early glimpse of economic and industry trends. In May, for example, Cisco was one of the first companies to warn of the darkening outlook for business globally, as the financial crisis in Europe drags on and other markets weaken as well.
The company reported that its net profit rose to $1.9 billion, a 56 percent increase from the quarter a year earlier. Cisco's operating profit in the quarter increased 15 percent to $2.5 billion, or 47 cents a share. The results slightly exceeded the average estimate by analysts of 45 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.

HEADLINE: Let's Make Him Do It

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Only by building real movements around food and other important issues can we pressure Barack Obama (or Mitt Romney) to act in the interests of the great majority. 

 BODY:
For positive change in the issues that affect our daily lives - not only food but also jobs, income, housing - we need active political leadership. But untilPresident Obama is pushed more strongly by the left, the coming presidential election represents a choice between a full-fledged attack on government services and a continuing slide into the gloomy and depressing world of austerity economics. That's a real choice, but it's not a happy one.
When Obama has been pressured on issues, like gay rights, immigration and the Keystone XL pipeline, he's responded positively. But he hasn't been pushed on food, and as a result has not followed up on campaign promises like his vow to label foods containing genetically modified ingredients, nor has he used his bully pulpit to try to protect SNAP (food stamps) from the ravages of Congress. Since there isn't a real food movement - yet! - progressives haven't made Obama do much.
At least he won't dismantle government, asMitt Romney andPaul Ryan would. Ryan's anti-stimulus plan is an unemployment-boosting scheme that would finance the military at a high level, the social safety net at the lowest possible level (Ryan is calling for a 17 percent cut infood stamps, enough to elicit criticisms from a pair of high-ranking Catholic bishops, for example) and just about nothing else. It benefits no one but the superrich and their representatives.
Not that that's anything new. Most people - call them working class, middle class or the 99 percent - have less money than they did a generation ago; the superrich have scads more. A vast majority of Americans are on the losing side of the class war, as evidenced by lower pay scales, eviscerated unions, fewer benefits, later retirement, shortened or eliminated vacations, starved municipalities and of course the quality of our food and the impact it has on us and the environment.
Obama has seen more power and money arrayed against him than perhaps any Democrat ever. But his lack of a workable plan for economic recovery and his right-leaning stances on fiscal responsibility and debt reduction remind us that the basic problem is not one of "progressive" Democrats versus "conservative" Republicans.
This isn't new either: in the last 40 years we've witnessed a long, steady move to the right, which Democrats occasionally whine about, protest and even fight, but in which they've been mostly complicit. Unless you reduce defense budgets - practically unheard of - whenever you cut taxes, you starve social programs and infrastructure, thus undermining the legitimate and beneficial role of government. (Even "progressive" Democrats are onboard with some cuts to food stamps in the as-yet-unpassed farm bill.) With government providing fewer services, it becomes easy to persuade people that it's an albatross, so why not cut taxes further? Enter Paul Ryan.
Candidate Obama led us to believe that he was a different kind of Democrat, and he stirred new and even skeptical old voters. Yet he's disappointed many supporters. You can argue that his hands have been tied: money is power - Citizens United has made this even more so - and until there's meaningful electoral and campaign-finance reform, along with real limits on lobbying, there's no chance for real progress.
President Obama didn't create this system; he's a product of it. A fundamental problem now is that the right has devised both a strategy and a movement, and the left has done neither. "All the bold answers are only from one side," Van Jones, author of "Rebuild the Dream," told me. "But we have to stop acting like there's one person with agency in America, whose name is Obama. It's not what he should do - it's what we should do."
That's right. Only by building real movements around food and other important issues can we pressure Obama (or even Romney; just look at the inroads the right made with a Democrat in office) to act in the interests of the great majority. A strategy for this is neatly outlined in the just-published paper "Prosperity Economics" by Jacob Hacker and Nate Loewentheil, which counters the nonsense of austerity economics and lays out a credible plan for public investments and economic security, a plan that could help revive jobs and growth and ensure "that gains are broadly shared." Their agenda improves on most economic plans by adding demands for dramatic political reform. "The best ideas are of little use without political movements, and those movements can only succeed in a political regime in which votes count more than money," Hacker said to me.
It's worth voting for progressives, but it's equally important to recognize that until there is real pressure from the left, the money and influence of the right will continue to pull any president in that direction.

HEADLINE: Europeans Skeptical of Israeli War Talk

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: In Europe, where many take a critical view of Israel's policies in the Middle East, commentators have expressed doubts as well as alarm at what some describe as a game of bluff over a possible strike against Iran. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The war talk in Israel, where authorities have been handing out gas masks in anticipation of a possible imminent conflict with Iran, has been met with a degree of skepticism in Europe.
Commentators have leaned toward the view that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and his defense minister, Ehud Barak, are involved in a naked exercise in bluff to put the squeeze on the Obama administration ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November.
 Nouvel Observateur in France was among the publications that suggested it might be a case of a "psychological war," to force the West to tighten sanctions against Tehran.
That analysis is not, of course, limited to the Europeans. The guessing game about the Israeli leaders' true intentions has also fired the debate in Israel and in the United States.
In Europe, however, where political leaders have largely stayed out of the debate, the speculation about whether a war is imminent reflected wider suspicions about the general direction of Israeli policy in the Middle East. 
Many Europeans appear less inclined than Americans to accept the Israeli narrative on developments in the region, whether it involves the Palestinian issue or the threat from Iran. 
That is sometimes reflected at the political level. As my colleague Nicholas Kulish writes from Berlin, American alarm about the threat posed by Hezbollah, Iran's Lebanese ally, is not shared in Europe, where the presence of the group's members continues to be tolerated.
Matthew Gould, Britain's ambassador to Israel, this month warned that Israel's actions in the Palestinian territories were leading to its international isolation.
El Pais in Spain accused Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak of "dangerous demagoguery" in trying to sidestep opposition from their own colleagues to try to convince the Israeli public of the need for a pre-emptive strike against Iran.
Forexagone, a French money market Web site, said the threat of an Israeli strike was scarcely credible and made little sense, "particularly in the current chaos in the Middle East and in view of the world's economic difficulties."
David Blair at Britain's Daily Telegraph raised doubts about Israel's capability to mount a successful attack and said that, if one were planned, the Israelis would not be talking about it.
"If the Israelis really were about to go into action - assuming they have the capability - they would not tell us beforehand," he wrote in a blog. "No tub-thumping belligerence would precede a war; on the contrary, it would come as a bolt from the blue."
Britain's Guardian newspaper said Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak were displaying "enthusiasm" for an air strike as part of a "lethal game of bluff."
"Even as bluff it is dangerous, and eminently combustible in a tinder-dry Middle East," the newspaper said.
The editorial earned it a blast from The Algemeiner, a Jewish newspaper in the United States, which accused The Guardian of echoing "Islamic anti-Semitism." It said the British newspaper was guilty of "arrogance, indeed imperiousness, which continually informs the Guardian's view of Jerusalem."
The Guardian editorial was guilty of "evoking the caricature of a manipulative Jewish state attempting to push the world's greatest superpower unwillingly to war," The Algemeiner's Adam Levick wrote.

HEADLINE: Romney's Message Moves Beyond Jobs

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In the last several weeks, Mr. Romney's campaign has been diverted - often of its own accord - from its singular focus on the economy. 

 BODY:
For most of the last year, Mitt Romney has stuck to one basic message: President Obama has botched the economy.
Top aides have long promised that nothing could divert the campaign from its mission to drive that message home. Early ads assailed the economic plight of the country, focusing on job losses during Mr. Obama's tenure, the unemployment rate and the nation's growing debt.
But in the last several weeks, Mr. Romney's campaign has been diverted - often of its own accord - to a host of other topics. The once singular message has become far more diverse. 
Mr. Romney has not abandoned his economic argument entirely. His stump speeches still include a searing critique of the president's inability to turn the economy around. And yet, the television ads made his campaign and his allies no longer feature that argument as the central one - at least for now. 
The move suggests a strategic shift by Mr. Romney's advisers to seize on other subjects - welfare, Medicare, religion - that might help fire up conservatives while also trying to appeal to wavering swing voters. 
But in the meantime, the campaign risks losing the disciplined message that once appeared to be the hallmark of Mr. Romney's second run for the White House.
Here's a rundown of the messages from Mr. Romney's team during the past several weeks.
 NEGATIVITY Mr. Romney has made a concerted effort to accuse his rivals of conducting what the Republican candidate calls a hate-filled campaign. In a speech in Ohio this week, he told Mr. Obama to "take your campaign of division and anger and hate back to Chicago."
That theme has been echoed by his new vice-presidential pick, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, as well as his allies at the Republican National Committee and independent groups. It has generated headlines on numerous days in the last two weeks.
Aides say it is a response to attacks by Mr. Obama and his allies, in particular an ad by Priorities USA Action that implied Mr. Romney was responsible for the death of a man's wife, and unsubstantiated comments from Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, about Mr. Romney's taxes.
Democrats call it whining, and insist the Republican has been just as negative. Either way, the argument threatens to drown out everything else.
 PAUL RYAN Announcing a vice-presidential pick was always going to shift the conversation. But Mr. Romney's decision to choose Mr. Ryan instead of one of his other potential running mates ensured a longer, more drawn-out period in which other messages would be drowned out.
And by announcing his pick early - two weeks before the start of the Republican convention - Mr. Romney provides plenty of time for attention to be diverted away from his basic themes.
Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney have started campaigning separately, but much of the media attention remains focused squarely on Mr. Ryan as reporters examine his background, his policy proposals and his initial foray onto the presidential stage.
 MEDICARE Knowing that Mr. Ryan's proposals on Medicare would be controversial, Mr. Romney's campaign has chosen to go on offense with an ad accusing the president of cutting $716 billion from the health care program for older people.
The new ad, called "Paid in," defends the "Romney-Ryan plan" for Medicare, saying it protects benefits and strengthens it for "the next generation."
The ad comes as Mr. Obama's campaign and other Democrats begin an all-out effort to highlight Mr. Ryan's plan to eventually turn Medicare into a voucher program in which senior citizens receive help to purchase private insurance.
Not discussed in the ad? Unemployment, jobs or the deficit.
 WELFARE The other big attack Mr. Romney's campaign has begun in recent weeks has been on the issue of welfare. Seizing on a recent directive by Mr. Obama's administration, the Romney campaign claims the president has eliminated the work requirement from the federal welfare program.
Mr. Romney has made the charge repeatedly on the stump, grabbing headlines every time. And his campaign has aired ads on the issue, prompting angry denunciations from Mr. Obama's campaign and numerous independent fact checkers who noted, accurately, that Mr. Obama's administration did no such thing.
 FOREIGN POLICY The decision to take a weeklong trip to Europe was perhaps the first indication that Mr. Romney was willing to shift away from his basic economic message. Even if everything on the gone well at each stop, his campaign would have been off-message.
Mr. Romney's trip was consumed in part by gaffes in Londonand Israel that robbed the campaign of the news coverage it had hoped for. But when he returned, Mr. Romney began running a television ad highlighting his trip to Israel, criticizing Mr. Obama for having not visited there as president.
He also released another television ad accusing Mr. Obama of "declaring war on religion" by requiring some religious institutions to pay for contraception coverage. The ad highlights Mr. Romney's visit to Poland during the trip abroad.
Neither of the ads talks about America's economic situation.
 'YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT' Unlike the other subjects, Mr. Romney's decision to hammer the president on his "build it" comments does fit with the broader economic message. Mr. Romney's campaign argues that Mr. Obama's comments reflect a lack of understanding about small businesses and their impact on the economy.
But the ads are still a departure from the more direct approach that characterized Mr. Romney's campaign for much of the year. Instead, the ads showcase small business owners upset with Mr. Obama's comments.
Those ads, too, drew denunciations from Mr. Obama and his allies, who said his words were taken out of context.

HEADLINE: Tax Analysts, Responding to Critics, Reaffirm Findings on Romney Plan

BYLINE: JACKIE CALMES


HIGHLIGHT: Tax Policy Center analysts reaffirmed their conclusion that Mitt Romney's proposals would help the highest-income taxpayers at the expense of everyone else. 

 BODY:
The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, after considering conservative critiques of its recent, much-publicized analysis of Mitt Romney's tax agenda, said on Thursday that its conclusion stands: His proposals would mean big tax cuts for the highest-income taxpayers and increases for everyone else.
"A reform proposal that meets the five goals" that Mr. Romney has outlined for overhauling the tax code "would have to raise burdens on middle-class households," the three authors of the analysis wrote in a nine-page response to the criticism. 
That is inevitable, they said, mainly as a consequence of two of Mr. Romney's five goals: His insistence that any tax overhaul should be revenue-neutral, neither reducing nor increasing annual budget deficits, and that it should protect or even sweeten existing tax breaks for savings and investment like those for dividends and capital gains income.
If Mr. Romney were willing to either increase deficits or reduce the tax breaks for investors, the authors said, then taxes would not necessarily have to go up for lower- and middle-income Americans. 
As his other three goals, Mr. Romney would cut income tax rates by 20 percent, eliminate the estate tax and end the alternative minimum tax, which was designed to ensure that the richest taxpayers did not escape liability due to various tax breaks but which increasingly threatens moderate-income households.
Some critics of the original study by the Tax Policy Center, which includes former economic advisers to presidents of both parties, have said that Mr. Romney has not proposed a detailed enough plan to analyze so conclusively. 
But the authors responded, "It is still possible to examine the broad implications of the five goals," using information from Mr. Romney and his campaign advisers.
As in their original analysis, the authors described how they essentially gave Mr. Romney the political benefit of the doubt, assuming that to keep his plans from adding to annual deficits he first would end all tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans - like those for mortgages, health insurance and charitable contributions (though not for investments and savings) - before touching the same tax breaks for lower-income Americans.
The authors also rebutted criticisms that their initial report did not sufficiently account for the potential benefits of Mr. Romney's separate proposals to lower the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent, reduce other business taxes and cut domestic spending deeply. 
The authors said they initially had assumed that Mr. Romney would offset the cost of his proposed cut in the corporate tax rate by scaling back other business tax breaks, but Romney advisers said that would not be the case. Yet that would mean "an even larger tax cut on high-income individuals, requiring even larger cuts to tax expenditures" - that is, tax breaks like those for mortgage interest - "and correspondingly larger increases in taxes on middle- and/or lower-income taxpayers."
Deep cuts in spending would have a similar impact, the authors added, hurting mostly low- and middle-income households because they disproportionately benefit from government programs and benefits. 
And to critics who have said the Center study did not assume enough economic growth from Mr. Romney's proposed tax cuts of roughly $5 trillion over 10 years, the authors said their conclusions were essentially the same even when using growth estimates developed by Gregory Mankiw, a Romney adviser, a Harvard professor and former economic official in the George W. Bush administration.
The authors, in their follow-up paper, also answered commentators who said the Center should have assumed that Mr. Romney would end tax breaks for state and local bonds and for some insurance policies. By not including those among his protected tax breaks for investments and savings, these critics have said, he could raise additional revenues and avoid increasing taxes from low- and middle-income taxpayers.
The authors, in their response, illustrated that repeal of the two tax breaks for public bonds and for certain life insurance savings would not raise enough revenue. They added, "Our main result still holds."

HEADLINE: Democrats Vying for Barney Frank's Seat Go Easy on Biden Gaffe

BYLINE: KATHARINE Q. SEELYE


HIGHLIGHT: Democratic candidates running to fill Representative Barney Frank's seat debated in Massachusetts on Thursday evening. 

 BODY:
BOSTON -- Joseph Kennedy III, who is hoping to succeed Representative Barney Frank in his suburban Boston district, avoided saying Thursday whether Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had gone too far when he said that Republicans would "put y'all back in chains."
Mr. Kennedy, 31, a grandson of the late Senator Robert F. Kennedy and great-nephew of President John F. Kennedy, was asked at a televised debate on NECN whether Mr. Biden, who was speaking in Virginia, had exacerbated a bad situation and should apologize.
Hesitant in his response, Mr. Kennedy said that Mr. Biden had "walked his comments back a bit and clarified what he meant by that." He then said, "It's really up to the presidential campaigns."
Mr. Biden had said after his initial remark that he was referring to the Republicans' plans to repeal the Obama administration's Wall Street reforms. But since many in the audience were African-American, critics said Mr. Biden was clearly referring to slavery.
The same question was posed to the two other Democrats running for the seat held for three decades by Mr. Frank, who is retiring.
Rachel Brown, a follower of Lyndon LaRouche, did not criticize Mr. Biden either. "African-Americans definitely have a lower living standard now, compared with other parts of the country," she said. "We need a program to put people to work, and that's the issue."
The third candidate, Herb Robinson, a software engineer, was more sympathetic to Mr. Biden.
"I occasionally misspeak myself, so I can understand him," Mr. Robinson said. "I'm sure he didn't mean what that implied. What he was trying to say was that if Romney gets elected, all of us will be having a tougher time except for the millionaires in the top one percent."
The candidates will face one another in a primary on Sept. 6, a Thursday. Three Republicans will also face one another that day.
Mr. Kennedy, who has already raised $1.3 million for the race, is widely perceived as the favorite, though he hesitated on some other questions, in addition to the one on Mr. Biden.
Asked if he supported medical marijuana, he said he was still looking into it. "We have to be very careful about it to make sure we don't turn into California," he said. Pressed, he said he would probably vote against it.
Asked if he supported physician-assisted suicide, he said he "would have to really think about that one too."
Ms. Brown said she opposed medical marijuana because it was intended to "destroy the minds of our population." On physician-assisted suicide, she responded that "human life is sacred."
Mr. Robinson said he had publicly supported the legalization of all marijuana, medical or otherwise, as had Mr. Frank. On physician-assisted suicide, he noted that he was a libertarian and so would support it.
The candidates were also asked if it was appropriate for Congress to spend $38 million in taxpayer money for the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate. Mr. Kennedy, who is the great-nephew of Edward, pointed out that the institute was a partnership with the University of Massachusetts Boston and said it would be "a great asset for Boston and our country."
Mr. Robinson shrugged and said he would probably support the taxpayer funding. Ms. Brown lost track of the question.
In their closing comments, Ms. Brown went first. She said the nation needed a "complete change" in its economic policy, said she wanted a revitalized space program and said President Obama should not be the party's nominee.
Mr. Kennedy said he had held 160 events in the district and it was clear to him that jobs and the economy were the most pressing issues. He said people wanted a fair chance to make the most of themselves, adding that he had spent his career fighting for justice. He then asked for voters' support.
Mr. Robinson said he had 30 years of experience "doing creative problem-solving for private industry," like capital gains tax reform. He then directed viewers to his Web site.
The debate was over in a half-hour.

HEADLINE: Ryan Says Requesting Stimulus Funds Was a Mistake

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Paul D. Ryan said on Thursday it was a mistake to have requested funds in 2009 from the federal stimulus bill after voting against it. 

 BODY:
Representative Paul D. Ryan said on Thursday it was a mistake to have requested funds in 2009 from the federal stimulus bill after voting against it.
Mr. Ryan earlier denied asking for money from the $787 billion stimulus on behalf of companies in his Wisconsin district, contradicting a report by The Boston Globe on Tuesday that he wrote to the federal Energy Department requesting funds for two companies to develop so-called green jobs.

"No, I never asked for stimulus,'' Mr. Ryan said in an interview with WCOP Cincinnati, which was broadcast Thursday. Mr. Ryan, along with Mitt Romney, who picked him as his running mate last week, have vociferously denounced the stimulus as an example of President Obama's failure to restore the economy. The Congressional Budget Office said the stimulus increased employment by 1.3 million to 3.3 million people.
Mr. Ryan said in the television interview that he did not recall writing the letters. Later, his office issued a statement that he had since checked into the letters. "They were treated as constituent service requests in the same way matters involving Social Security or Veterans Affairs are handled,'' he said in the statement. "This is why I didn't recall the letters earlier. But they should have been handled differently, and I take responsibility for that. Regardless, it's clear that the Obama stimulus did nothing to stimulate the economy, and now the President is asking to do it all over again.''

HIGHLIGHT: Did the Obama campaign maneuver Mitt Romney into choosing Paul Ryan as his running mate? 

 BODY:
Attack your opponent's strength: that has become the fundamental rule of modern politics.
The Obama campaign has had quite a bit of success attacking Romney's success. So much so that last week Romney jumped of the cliff of desperation and chose Paul Ryan, the Republican wonk star, Tea Party darling and boy wonder of dubious budgets, as his running mate.
This essentially shifted the campaign's conversation from Romney's best hope, a focus on the economy, to a worst case scenario - a didactic discussion of policy, particularly Medicare, in which Romney and Ryan (I like Ry-omney) must tell America to eat its spinach so we can grow up strong.
Having a debate about fundamentally changing Medicare during an election in which the two biggest swing states, Florida and Pennsylvania, are also among those with thegreatest percentage of the elderly (17.3 and 15.4 percent, respectively)? Sounds like a campaign with a death wish.
One thing that we learned from the health care debate is that many Americans resist change, on principle, even if might benefit them, because they are afraid of it. And it's hard for education campaigns to have an impact on an electorate conditioned to 15-second clips and satisfied with sound-bites.
Americans can have big discussions about big issues, but math and minor details are a hard combination to hang a campaign on.
So by hammering Romney on his strength, the Obama campaign forced him to make a disastrous choice for a running mate. According to a Gallup report issued on Monday, the response to the Ryan pick "is among the least positive reactions to a vice presidential choice Gallup has recorded in recent elections." Score one for Team Obama.
But now Romney appears to be going after Obama's strength: his likability.
Obama's favorability rating is in the mid-50s, according to recent polls, while Romney's is in the mid-40s.
At a campaign stop in Ohio on Tuesday, Romney said of Obama:
And so his campaign has resorted to diversions and distractions, to demagoguing and defaming others. This is an old game in politics; what's different this year is that the president is taking things to a new low. His campaign and his surrogates have made wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the presidency.
Romney continued:
Another outrageous charge came a few hours ago in Virginia. And the White House sinks a little bit lower. This is what an angry and desperate presidency looks like.
That was a reference to an unfortunate comment Vice President Joe Biden made to a largely black audience in Virginia. Biden said:
Romney wants to let the - he said the first 100 days - he's gonna let the big banks once again write their own rules. Unchain Wall Street. He gonna put y'all back in chains.
Some have suggested that Biden's comment was a reference to slavery. If it was, I'm not a fan of such references. But it's hardly the place of the Republicans to object now, given that they said nothing when one of their primary candidates, Herman Cain, stewed in slavery metaphors. Cain was fond of saying that he had left the "Democrat plantation." In one speech, Cain said, about being a black conservative, "I tell some of my callers: It may shock you, but some black people can think for themselves." In an ad, Cain said: "our tax code is the 21st century version of slavery."
I don't recall Republicans complaining then. In fact, Cain even led in the polls for a while. This feels hypocritical.
We should have seen Romney's new tack coming, because he began hinting at it last week. As NBC News reported Friday, Romney "said in the interview he would like a pledge (of sorts) with Obama that there be no 'personal' attack ads":
Our campaign would be helped immensely if we had an agreement between both campaigns that we were only going to talk about issues and that attacks based upon - business or family or taxes or things of that nature.
Question: Is Romney really saying that scrutinizing his business record - which he has held up as one of his chief qualifications to be president - is personal? But we digress.
He continued: "We only talk about issues. And we can talk about the differences between our positions and our opponent's position." 
Of his own campaign, Romney said: 
Our ads haven't gone after the president personally. We haven't dredged up the old stuff that people talked about last time around. We haven't gone after the personal things.
The Romney campaign's special pleading for substance and civility is strange given that the super PACs supporting it drowned his primary opponents in negative ads.
Newt Gingrich got it so badly that he declared, "I've been Romney-boated."
At the time, Romney's take on negative advertising was clear: "If you can't stand the relatively modest heat in the kitchen right now wait until Obama's hell's kitchen shows up."
Well, it has shown up and it has worked just like Romney's did then. Now he's whining that Obama is winning.
So far the Obama campaign has simply outsmarted the Romney campaign in the electoral art of war. This change in strategy is just Romney's most recent attempt to regain his footing: trying to paint a likable president as a hateful one.
Good luck with that.

HEADLINE: Square Offers Flat-Rate Plan for Small Businesses

BYLINE: JENNA WORTHAM


HIGHLIGHT: Square will drop the processing fees for small businesses using its service, offering a flat-rate plan in an effort to entice more of them to sign up. 

 BODY:
 Not long after Square made waves by announcing a partnership with Starbucks, the company is offering a deal to companies at the smaller end of the spectrum.
On Thursday, Square, which offers a mobile payment service, said it would give small businesses in the United States -- those that process up to $250,000 a year in transactions through Square -- the option of paying a flat fee of $275 a month, rather than 2.75 percent per transaction. At that rate, the deal makes sense for businesses processing more than $10,000 a month.
Mr. Rabois said that he hoped the simplified pricing structure would encourage more small companies and business owners to sign up to use Square.
"The main reason people don't participate is because they are bewildered by it," he said. "Most people have no idea what 2.75 percent per swipe will amount to. They'd rather be making cupcakes for their customers instead of trying to parse all this stuff." 
If a business hits the $250,000-a-year level on transactions through Square, the 2.75 percent per-transaction fee will go into effect. And that fee will also apply to all transactions over $400.
For Square, its another step to accelerate the race toward a digital wallet and a cashless economy. The company is gunning to edge out competitors also hoping to become the primary way people pay for things on a smartphone, which includes heavyweights like Microsoft and Google and new entrants like GoPago.
Mr. Rabois said Square was able to offer the new plan because its transaction volume was high enough to make it financially viable. 
"We have the scale, and we're growing fairly rapidly, that we have negotiating ability to drop the processing fees from card companies," he said. "The average coffee shop doesn't have that ability."
Square's adoption has been swift. The company has doubled its number of users to two million since the start of the year. It says it is processing $6 billion in transactions a year and has signed up more than 75,000 merchants.

HEADLINE: Ecuador Grants Asylum to WikiLeaks Founder

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN and MAGGY AYALA; William Neuman reported from Caracas, and Maggy Ayala from Quito, Ecuador. John F. Burns, Ravi Somaiya and Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London; and Christine Anderson from Stockholm.

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela -- Ecuador forcefully rejected pressure from Britain and announced Thursday that it was granting political asylum to Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who has been holed up for two months in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London trying to avoid extradition to Sweden.The decision, citing the possibility that Mr. Assange could face ''political persecution'' or be sent to the United States to face the death penalty, escalated the unusually sharp strains between Ecuador and Britain, and drew an angry rebuttal from Sweden. The Ecuadorean move protects Mr. Assange from British arrest, but only on Ecuadorean territory, leaving him vulnerable if he tries to leave the embassy to head to an airport or train station.
Ecuador's foreign minister, Ricardo Patiño, made the announcement at a news conference in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito.
''The government of Ecuador, faithful to its tradition of protecting those who seek refuge in its territory or in its diplomatic missions, has decided to grant diplomatic asylum to Julian Assange,'' he said, reading from a government communiqué. He added, ''There are indications to presume that there could be political persecution,'' and that Mr. Assange would not get a fair trial in the United States and could face the death penalty there. 
Mr. Patiño said he hoped Britain would permit Mr. Assange to leave the embassy for Ecuador. But at a news conference on Thursday in London, the British foreign secretary, William Hague, repeated the government's stance that Britain was legally bound to to extradite Mr. Assange to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over accusations that he sexually assaulted two women.
Tensions between Britain and Ecuador had been building over Britain's efforts to secure a handover of Mr. Assange. Mr. Hague described a multitude of negotiations for a handover, including ''seven formal discussions as well as many other conversations.'' But Wednesday night, Mr. Patiño said that the British authorities had threatened to force their way into the embassy, responding: ''We are not a British colony.'' On Thursday, just before the announcement of asylum, President Rafael Correa said on his Twitter account: ''No one is going to terrorize us!''
The president of the National Assembly of Ecuador called a special session for Thursday evening to discuss the perceived threat against the embassy by the British government.
The British Foreign Office said it was disappointed by the Ecuadorean announcement but remained committed to a negotiated outcome to the standoff. Sweden's foreign minister, Carl Bildt, rejected the suggestion that Sweden would be involved in any kind of persecution. ''Our firm legal and constitutional system guarantees the rights of each and everyone,'' he wrote on Twitter. '' We firmly reject any accusations to the contrary.''
A spokesman for Sweden's Foreign Ministry, Anders Joöle, said the country's legal system had been impugned and that the Ecuadorean ambassador had been summoned.
In Sweden, Claes Borgström, the lawyer representing the two women who have accused Mr. Assange of sexual abuses, told the online newspaper Expressen.se that the women had expected the decision but still thought it absurd and were disappointed.
''Assange is a coward,'' Mr. Borgström said. ''He is accused of assault, but he is totally uninterested in my clients. He has shifted his focus elsewhere.''
Mr. Patiño's news conference was broadcast live on British television and Mr. Assange watched the announcement as it happened, British news reports said. He told embassy staff members: ''It is a significant victory for myself and my people. Things will probably get more stressful now.''
Outside the embassy, a small red brick apartment block behind Harrods department store in the upscale Knightsbridge neighborhood, a protester with a megaphone provided sporadic updates on the progress of the news conference in Quito. When it became clear that Mr. Assange had won asylum, the response was a muted joy. ''It's great news,'' said a youth worker, 21, who gave his name only as James. ''As long as Britain honors his right to asylum,'' he added, outlining his hope that the British government would allow Mr. Assange to leave the country without arresting him. If that did not happen, he said, gesturing to the protesters around him, ''this will only get bigger.'' Like many of the protesters, the youth worker said he believed that the accusations of sexual abuse and rape against Mr. Assage were part of a conspiracy to silence WikiLeaks. ''Textbook character assassination,'' he said.
Speculation immediately turned to whether, and how, Mr. Assange might seek to escape.
Mr. Patiño said his government had made its decision after the authorities in Britain, Sweden and the United States refused to give guarantees that, if Mr. Assange were extradited to Sweden, he would not then be sent on to the United States to face other charges.
Those close to Mr. Assange have said that he fears ending up in the United States, which could bring charges over Wikileaks's release in 2010 of thousands of secret documents and diplomatic cables relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as to American relations with other governments.
Mr. Jörle, the Swedish foreign ministry spokesman, said there had been no request from the United States for custody of Mr. Assange.
Some analysts said that Ecuador had entered a high-stakes game on Mr. Assange's behalf. Mauricio Gándara, a former ambassador for Ecuador in London warned that by granting him asylum, Ecuador risked jeapordizing trade ties with England and other European Union countries. In 2011 about 28 percent of Ecuador's nonpetroleum exports went to the European Union, according to government data. Nonpetroleum exports to the United Kingdom were $139 million last year.
''What Ecuador is doing is a very delicate thing,'' Mr. Gándara said. ''Ecuador is risking its economic interests for this adventure of defending Mr. Assange.''
He said that he was not aware of any previous dispute of similar magnitude between the two countries.
Mr. Assange arrived at the embassy on June 19, seeking to avoid extradition to Sweden. Jérémie Zimmerman, a friend who has spoken with him recently, said Mr. Assange had found the narrowing of his horizons hard. ''It is quite difficult not to be able to get out in the street for all this time,'' he said. ''He lived for so many years free, without even a home to limit him. And now he is isolated.''
The WikiLeaks founder sleeps on an air mattress in a small office that has been converted to a bedroom, according to accounts of those who have visited him. He has access to a computer and continues to oversee WikiLeaks, his lieutenants have said. Reporters outside the building have seen food being delivered from nearby restaurants.
His presence is a challenge for employees of the embassy. One British government official, citing a conversation with a member of the embassy staff, said that the situation was surreal.
A diplomat familiar with Mr. Assange's situation said that he spent his time in a back room, which gets no direct sunlight. Several weeks ago he had a bad cold and appeared depressed, the source said.
''He can't get outside to see the sun,'' his mother, Christine Assange, said in a recent interview conducted in Quito for BBC Mundo, a BBC Web site. ''I'm worried about his health, as I would be for anybody who is having to stay indoors and not get exercise and have sunlight.''
She said some of Mr. Assange's friends have encouraged him to put on music and dance as a way of getting physical activity and that they had also brought sunlamps.''
Although WikiLeaks has shrunk substantially during the 20 months of Mr. Assange's legal battle in Britain, losing many of its most skilled computer experts along with several of Mr. Assange's closest associates in building the organization, it has continued to issue statements about his plight.
On Thursday, ahead of the Ecuadorean decision, it issued a new, unsigned statement describing Britain's warning that it might suspend the embassy's immunity as part of an action to arrest Mr. Assange as a ''resort to intimidation'' and a breach of the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations between states.
''We remind the public that these extraordinary actions are being taken to detain a man who has not been charged with any crime in any country,'' the statement said. It added: ''We further urge the U.K. government to show restraint, and to consider the dire ramifications of any violation of the elementary norms of international law.''
It struck many as odd that Mr. Assange, who shot to fame as a fighter for media freedom, chose Ecuador as a potential refuge. Mr. Correa has presided over a crackdown on journalists there.
But when Mr. Assange arrived at the embassy, he issued a statement saying that Mr. Correa had invited him to seek asylum in Ecuador during an interview for Mr. Assange's TV show on Russia Today, an English-language cable channel financed by the government of Vladimir V. Putin.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Inch Higher, But It's Not All Bad News

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment edged up slightly last week but remained at a level consistent with modest gains in hiring, the Labor Department said Thursday in one of several economic reports that gave mixed signals about the nation's economy.Unemployment benefit applications rose by 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 366,000, the agency said. The less volatile four-week average fell by 5,500 to 363,750, the lowest level since late March.
In other reports, the Commerce Department said builders broke ground on fewer homes in July than in June, but applications for building permits rose to their highest level in four years. 
And the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said manufacturing in the Philadelphia region shrank for a fourth straight month. The bank said its index of regional manufacturing activity was minus 7.1 in August, which was better than in July, when it read minus 12.9. Any reading below zero indicates contraction.
A measure of new orders improved slightly but still showed contraction. And an index of hiring declined.
In home construction, the weakness in July came from a 6.5 percent decline in the building of single-family homes, which represent about 70 percent of the market. They fell to an annual rate of 502,000, down from a two-year high reached in June. By contrast, construction of apartments rose 12.4 percent to an annual rate of 244,000 units.
But applications for building permits rose 6.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 812,000.
''Given the strong increase in permits, the likelihood is that builders will be digging a lot more homes in the months to come,'' said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors. He said that developers were taking out permits only ''if they expect to put a shovel into the ground in the immediate future.''
For July, total home construction rose in the Midwest but fell in all other parts of the country.
Even with the gains made this year, the rate of construction and the level of permits remain only about half the 1.5 million annual rate considered healthy.
Economists cautioned that housing was still a long way from where it should be.
''The housing market is getting better, but it is taking a long time,'' Patrick Newport, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said.
Home builder confidence grew this month to a five-year high, according to the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo sentiment index. The index rose to 37 from 35 in July. And many builders reported their best sales since February 2007.
Still, any reading below 50 indicates negative sentiment about the housing market. The index has not been in positive territory since April 2006, the peak of the housing boom.
Applications for unemployment benefits have been declining in the last two months, indicating companies are laying off fewer workers and hiring is picking up. When applications fall consistently below 375,000, it generally suggests hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.
''Claims so far in August have declined moderately compared to July, suggesting some improvement in the U.S. job environment. And that's good news,'' Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said.
The number of people receiving some kind of unemployment assistance also fell, to 5.68 million for the week that ended July 28, 70,000 below the previous week.
The decline in the number of people applying for weekly unemployment benefits has been one of several signs that the economy rebounded in July.
Employers added 163,000 jobs in July, the most since February. Job gains averaged only 73,000 jobs a month from April through June, not enough to keep up with a rising population. The unemployment rate blipped up to 8.3 percent, from 8.2 percent.

HEADLINE: Brother, Can You Spare a Dollar?

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
Thom Hoffman, the director of the amateurish ''Brother, Can You Spare a Dollar?,'' apparently attended the Scattershot School of Documentary Filmmaking. He has a moderately interesting point he wants to make -- comparing the current state of the economy with the Great Depression -- but his method of doing so is to blast away haphazardly, hitting the target only occasionally.The film starts out promisingly, by noting how common one particular phrase has been in the past four years: ''since the Great Depression.'' Joblessness and everything related to it are routinely described as being at their worst since the 1930s. Mr. Hoffman wants to demonstrate that comparing the two periods has limitations because the people left jobless back then, many of them recent immigrants, were a different breed from today's unemployed: less gimme-gimme, more frugal and more accustomed to making do with what they had, or simply doing without. 
''Their expectations were at best uncertain,'' the narration says. ''Many felt entitled to nothing.''
From there, though, the film turns into a disorganized rant, jumping from Uneeda Biscuits to the Glass-Steagall Act to kids and their infernal text messaging and anything else that occurred to Mr. Hoffman or the seemingly random collection of people he allows to spout off on camera. The whole enterprise has a get-off-my-lawn feel; it tries to pass off whining and a rose-colored-glasses view of the past as insight.
Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Thom Hoffman 1 hour 10 minutes; not rated

HEADLINE: Bookstores For Gazers

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
Especially in the summer, when the sidewalks of the New York art world turn into barren, windswept places, I spend a lot of time visiting what I like to think of as a parallel art world, one that seems almost clandestine.In this world the galleries don't have the word ''gallery'' in the name. Many are tough to find, located along anonymous hallways of nondescript buildings. They tend to be on the small side, and some keep irregular hours. But they can be as visually sumptuous as any traditional gallery. And they are democratic places, where the art can be (occasionally, carefully) handled and where someone with means as meager as mine can afford to build a little collection.
To describe them as bookstores -- which they are, in the narrowest technical sense -- would be a little like describing ''On the Road'' as a guide to traveling America by automobile. Yes, you can buy books in these stores, mostly books about art or artists, or books made by artists, or books and other things, mostly on paper, directly or obliquely related to the life of contemporary art. 
But over the last few years the city has entered a kind of golden age of art-book establishments that transcend the bounds of the bookstore. Relative newcomers like Karma, a tiny publishing-office-meets-shop in the West Village, and 6 Decades, upstairs in a ramshackle-looking building on Canal Street, have joined veterans like Specific Object in Chelsea and, a few blocks away, Printed Matter, the artist-founded nonprofit that is now in its fourth decade.
Dashwood Books, which specializes in new and hard-to-find photography publications, opened in 2005 on Bond Street at the edge of the East Village. And just a few months ago a mysterious dealer named Fulton Ryder opened a truly unclassifiable, appointment-only shop on the Upper East Side. (A recent tour of the shop was granted on the condition that its location, in a dim 1970s-flavored apartment building, not be revealed; its owner's true identity, however, has been an open secret for months -- Fulton Ryder is a nom de plume of the artist and prominent book collector Richard Prince.)
What all these stores have in common is a firm belief in the book as art, at a time when the form of the book itself is dematerializing into the digital at a rapid clip. Of course, artists have made great art in book form for decades, centuries even, and New York has gloried in earlier art-bookstore golden ages, done in by real estate prices and shifting tastes.
But perhaps because the physical book is coming to seem more like an object than ever before, the current landscape of shops blurs the line between bookstore and gallery in rollicking, unpredictable fashion. And because the shops are not nearly as tethered to high-end economics as art galleries, the mélange of stuff that results, some for sale and some not, can be strange and wonderful, like highly personalized cross sections cut from the culture at large.
Not long ago I wandered into Karma when it was having a deadpan summer show, selling fluffy beach towels, shell pots and balls of twine (large and small) at the same time that it stocked copies of Ed Sanders's ''Poem From Jail'' (1963; nicely priced at $30); a special-edition book by the artist Rob Pruitt, with covers made of solid marble ($500); Baudrillard's ''Agony of Power'' (a 2010 edition); and ''The Illustrated Elvis'' (W. A. Harbinson, 1976).
Uptown, inside Mr. Prince's space, it looks as if books have forcibly colonized a railroad-style apartment, setting up forward positions in the closets and even the silverware drawers next to the dishwasher.
It reminded me of the conceptual artist Dan Graham's idea that magazines are like the pods in Don Siegel's 1956 film ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers,'' planting ideas subliminally inside unsuspecting homes. The shop and others of its kind also feel a little like late comic twists on postmodernism's death of the author. In Flann O'Brien's classic novel ''At Swim-Two-Birds,'' the characters drug the novelist and take control of their own plots. In many of the places on my book circuit, the books and posters and magazines seem to have taken on an autonomous life as well, communing conspiratorially with one another across decades, subject matter and format.
This particular kind of art-book mind meld owes a lot to Mr. Prince, who has made collecting an integral part of his art career. ''I want the earliest copy on record,'' he once wrote of his compulsion. ''I want the copy that is rarer than anyone had previously dreamed of. I want the copy that dreams.'' The phenomenon is also indebted to dealers and collectors like John McWhinnie in New York and Steven Leiber in San Francisco (both of whom died this year).
David Platzker, the owner of Specific Object, cites as his inspirations both Barbara Moore, whose stores Bound & Unbound and before that Backworks in Greenwich Village, were pioneering (he bought Ms. Moore's inventory), and Dagny Corcoran, whose influential Art Catalogues, in Los Angeles, ''is now part of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
''Dagny was the first one who helped me see books as this sort of revered physical space,'' said Mr. Platzker at his shop and gallery the other day. ''To her, they are so much more than things people should stack on their coffee tables.''
Mr. Platzker was just taking down a small show of 1970s pieces by Jack Goldstein -- framed, brightly colored 45 r.p.m. records with titles like ''A German Shepard,'' ''A Swim Against the Tide'' and ''Two Wrestling Cats,'' recordings of nothing more than the things described by the words. ''We had the sounds playing continuously during the show, and it was quite nice,'' he said. ''At night you could hear dog and cat sounds echoing down the hallways here.''
I had come in with my eye on a signed copy of the book ''Dan Graham's New Jersey,'' which I spotted on the shop's Web site, but I took a look at the $175 price and a harder look at my annual budget and thought better of it. So I contented myself with admiring, inside a glass case, a pristine first edition of ''The Catcher in the Rye,'' whose dust jacket announced boldly that its author was ... Richard Prince.
As you might be aware, Mr. Prince did not write that celebrated novel. But last year he created a little guerrilla reprint that deviously imagined it to be so. And in a parallel universe where the books are in charge, making the art, who knows? Maybe it is.

HEADLINE: Film Tackles Capitalism and Identity

BYLINE: By CHRYSTIA FREELAND | REUTERS

 BODY:
NEW YORK -- We all know it would be virtuous to spend more time pondering the implications of globalization and the intricacies of high finance. But these aren't always the most enticing subjects to study, especially in the languid, fading days of August. For an easy-listening approach to two of the most important themes of our time, you could do worse than devote an evening to ''Supercapitalist,'' a new financial thriller set in Hong Kong.The most immediately striking take-away from ''Supercapitalist'' is the moral hierarchy it imposes on business. The only truly virtuous capitalists are the technologists -- hard-working, creative and focused on innovations that will help ordinary people as well as the bottom line. Next best are the makers of real things, in this case a logistics company. Worst of all are the financiers, a treacherous, murderous bunch who care only about making money even if the price is human lives. 
In light of the public attitude toward bankers, those who work for Mitt Romney should watch this film and talk to its star and screenwriter, Derek Ting. That's because Mr. Ting has made a film that raises some provocative political questions, but his personal agenda is entirely artistic: He set out to tell ''a universal, human story.'' His ethical ranking of business, with the money- changers emphatically at the bottom, is an instinctive choice, not an intellectual one. That says a lot about current views on the subject, even on one of the world's most energetic capitalist frontiers.
Mr. Ting's exploration of globalization is more nuanced and more self-conscious. ''Supercapitalist,'' which moves from boardrooms and shipping yards to casinos and bars filled with call girls, does a fine job conveying the mood of a city in the throes of rapid economic transformation. Mr. Ting told an audience at a screening in New York that Hong Kong, where he lives, is ''a make-it-happen town.''
''The stakes are very high in Asia,'' he told me later. ''It is a teeter-totter. Things are shifting eastward. It is something we can't ignore. There is massive growth and opportunity.''
It is instructive, and fun, to catch a glimpse of some of the tastes, colors and flavors of this rising China, but that story itself is familiar. That's why Mr. Ting's variations on the theme are so welcome.
One is that the rapacious capitalist villains are white Americans (one of them, inevitably, an investment banker at ''Silverman Brothers'') and their victims are hard-working, family-minded Chinese business people. At a time when the United States is worried that Chinese capitalists are eating their Yankee lunch, Mr. Ting's Hong Kong-nurtured perspective is a valuable counterpoint.
Another notion, which is touched on by the film and figures prominently in Mr. Ting's own life, is how, for today's generation of hyphenated Americans, the American dream is being inverted. It remains a central truth on the presidential campaign trail that the United States is the land of opportunity, to which the world's huddled masses continue to flock. But the protagonist of ''Supercapitalist'' is the son of immigrants who seeks his fortune by going back to his family's homeland.
To appreciate what a swift and profound shift that is, consider how Mr. Ting's own parents reacted to his decision to move to Hong Kong.
''They really didn't want me to go back to Asia,'' said Mr. Ting, who was born near Westchester County, New York, and whose parents are ethnic Chinese from the Philippines. ''They said, 'We moved here so you would have a better life.'''
The final issue ''Supercapitalist'' raises is the fluidity of national identity in the age of globalization.
The film's real-life back story is an aspect of identity politics that isn't new at all -- the lack of starring roles for Asian-American men. It is an issue Mr. Ting is a little reluctant to talk about. ''I didn't want this to be just about being Asian-American,'' he said. ''I mean, what year is this already?''
But he admits that a powerful motivation for making the movie was to create a lead role for himself. ''I realized even if I train hard, even if I'm the best actor -- which I'm not -- it won't make a difference if the opportunity isn't there,'' he said. Pursuing that vision took grit; some potential financial backers told Mr. Ting he could raise a lot more money if he made the star white.
Ironically, the film points out that when they get to Asia, Asian-Americans like both Mr. Ting and the protagonist of ''Supercapitalist'' are seen first and foremost as Americans.
As for Mr. Ting himself, he says his identity depends on where he is. ''A lot of us feel, you go to Hong Kong, you feel more American,'' he said. ''You come to the U.S., and you feel more Asian.''
That mixed identity can be uncomfortable -- it can be hard to be a perpetual outsider. But as the global economy becomes more interconnected, Mr. Ting thinks belonging to many places is becoming an advantage.
''We can bridge both cultures, which is a strength when Asia is on the rise,'' he told me. ''The world is becoming much more global, and that puts our types in a very interesting position to bring the world together. There is a new global citizen emerging.''

HEADLINE: Hollywood Villains Are Killing Opera

BYLINE: By ZACHARY WOOLFE

 BODY:
''The opera?'' the main character of Kenneth Lonergan's recent film, ''Margaret,'' sourly asks her mother. ''Why are you going to the opera?''The character is just a teenager being sullen, but her question unintentionally gets to the heart of the matter. Why do we go to the opera? What are we hoping to get from it? These are crucial questions as opera companies across America, fighting the same economic headwinds as the rest of the country, struggle simply to survive.
This art form, with its enormous casts, sets and orchestras, and its armies of stagehands and administrative staff, was a dubious financial proposition even before the most recent downturn. I was once told that the good opera company directors are those who lose money responsibly.
But there are problems deeper than financial ones with American opera, and they predated the recession by many decades. As you look across the country, you find pockets of innovation and experimentation, but the landscape is overwhelmingly drab. 
The repertory is largely stagnant, focused on the same small group of hits. The few big stars who remain -- the Plácido Domingos, Renée Flemings and Anna Netrebkos -- are needed to sell almost anything that is not ''Aida,'' ''Carmen'' or ''Turandot.''
The typical production style is blandly nostalgic escapism rather than vibrancy or relevance. This was the case through much of America in the 20th century, and there hasn't been much change so far in the 21st.
When I am asked about the reasons for these deeper problems, I say there are two: ''Moonstruck'' and ''Pretty Woman.''
After all, these films are what most Americans probably think about when they think about going to the opera. Each has a key scene set at an opera performance, in both cases the most standard of the standard repertory: Puccini's ''Bohème'' in ''Moonstruck,'' Verdi's ''Traviata'' in ''Pretty Woman.''
In the two movies the vision of opera is the same: lush, static, stale. It is less a living encounter than a trip to Madame Tussauds. The experience of going is about wearing fancy clothes and having an expensive dinner, about leaving everyday life behind. It is about a few tears, not about deep emotion or thought. Opera is the most solemn kind of date night.
Though both films have been given credit for helping to popularize opera, the idea of the art form they have popularized has profoundly damaged it in this country. The films have taught Americans a particular idea of what opera is, so that is the kind of opera Americans think they want. This is a large part of the reason audiences still flood en masse only to the war horses, and why they resist any directorial interpretation of those war horses that isn't traditional.
So companies, well aware of what sells, offer endless iterations of operas like ''La Bohème'' and ''La Traviata.'' With little opportunity for people to experience other pockets of the repertory or production styles, the vicious cycle continues. It is no wonder that most opera in this country is musty and inert when popular representations of the art form make it seem as if that were the only option.
I was reminded of ''Moonstruck'' and ''Pretty Woman'' as I watched ''Margaret,'' which recently came out in an extended cut on DVD after a long battle over the release of the movie, which had a brief theatrical run in a shorter version last year.
''Margaret'' -- which tells the story of Lisa (Anna Paquin), a Manhattan teenager whose life enters a tailspin after she witnesses a fatal bus accident -- revolves around opera, which is omnipresent both in the film's underscoring and in the plot itself. The film is anchored by two scenes that take place during Metropolitan Opera performances of Bellini's ''Norma'' and Offenbach's ''Contes d'Hoffmann.'' The Offenbach scene stars a dream team of Ms. Fleming and Susan Graham singing the famous Barcarolle.
As in ''Moonstruck'' and ''Pretty Woman,'' these are serious date nights, with off-the-shoulder gowns. The productions are ornately stolid: far more traditional visually than the Met's current version of either opera.
Early in the film the shimmering prelude to the first act of Wagner's ''Lohengrin'' begins as the movie follows Lisa in slow motion. The same prelude plays again as Lisa leaves a small memorial for the woman who died in the bus accident, alternating her image with elegiac shots of traffic in the rain and an airplane moving through the sky.
''Addio del passato,'' the heartbreaking aria from ''La Traviata,'' plays as Lisa makes a journey to Brooklyn to visit the driver of the bus. Two of Strauss's ''Four Last Songs'' accompany loving shots of Manhattan buildings; the image of one of the new buildings at ground zero is greeted by the orchestral surge that opens ''Im Abendrot.'' The simmering music that starts the third act of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' and crushing chords from Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' underline moments of intense drama.
Mr. Lonergan's directorial debut, the acclaimed ''You Can Count on Me,'' from 2000, was restrained, intimate, modest. ''Margaret,'' by contrast, is interested in self-dramatization and melodrama: it is sprawling and proudly overwrought. The infusion of opera seems intended to supersize the scale of ''You Can Count on Me'' to be ''operatic.''
But connecting opera so closely to red-meat emotionalism -- melodrama, tears and screaming matches -- also betrays a limited, and limiting, understanding of what the art form can be, signaling to its audience that its other aspects are less important. In this, ''Margaret'' is no better than Lars von Trier's ''Melancholia,'' from last year, in which relentless repetitions of music from ''Tristan und Isolde'' did little beyond telegraph the most obvious and superficial emotional cues.
In Woody Allen's ''Hannah and Her Sisters,'' on the other hand, there is also a scene set at a Met performance. The repertory isn't exactly innovative -- Puccini's ''Manon Lescaut'' -- but operagoing is shown as organic to its characters' lives. Opera, in the best way, is no big deal.
But until opera stops being associated with escapist nostalgia and fancy dates, it is doomed to struggle for relevance.
''Why are you going to the opera?'' Lisa asks in ''Margaret,'' but the depiction in that film and others can make it hard to answer the question.

HEADLINE: Struggling Brooklyn Market Loses a Farmer

BYLINE: By AARON EDWARDS

 BODY:
A young girl walked back and forth near a street corner in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, on Thursday, handing out fliers and calling out: ''Farmers' market! Farmers' market!''But there was little activity to behold at Lefferts and Albany Avenues. In fact, there was only one food stand. A small board hung over an adjacent table, bearing the inscription ''R.I.P. Farmer Roy.''
The death on Aug. 11 of Roy Hildebrant, 48, the primary source of produce and the catalyst for much of the foot traffic for the Crown Heights Farmers Market, has highlighted for some the fragility of fresh produce markets in New York's poorer neighborhoods. Many hang by a thread financially, often relying on the sacrifice of farmers like Mr. Hildebrant who strive to bring fresh food to urban areas. 
Mr. Hildebrant, who lived on a farm in Hackettstown, N.J., where he was raised, was tall, husky and soft-spoken. He was known in Crown Heights, where the market opened last September and is held on Thursdays, for teaching children the importance of healthful, fresh produce at a time when obesity rates have skyrocketed.
''He was proud to do it, first of all. He wanted to make the market proud, and he always brought his best to the table,'' said Michele Hildebrant, 46, Mr. Hildebrant's wife. ''He wanted nothing in return. He just wanted to make people laugh and smile.''
New York State has the second largest number of farmers' markets in the United States, with 647 markets, behind California, which has 827, according to the federal Agriculture Department.
Still, while the number of markets in New York City has increased (to 127 this year from 108 in 2009, according to the state Agriculture and Marketing Department), maintenance and operating costs can be prohibitive.
Though farmers' markets are booming in Union Square and elsewhere in the city, those in lower-income neighborhoods, like Crown Heights and parts of Harlem, survive off grants intended to increase food options in areas with few supermarkets.
Faced with a growing need for produce in such areas, the Cuomo administration has periodically expanded its FreshConnect program, which since 2011 has offered grants for projects like farmers' markets that increase the availability of farm products and fresh food.
But catering to communities in the city, which may vary ethnically from one block to the next, requires an understanding of local palates. Crown Heights, for example, is home to large West Indian and Jewish populations. One of the most popular stands at its market is the Jamaican booth, which on Thursday offered plenty of callaloo leaves, a much-loved Caribbean dish. (They go well with fried plantains.)
''Farmers' markets are more than just sharing the vegetables,'' said Linda LaViolette, director of farmers' markets at Empire State Development, the state's chief economic development agency. ''It's about building communities.''
Those communities also struggle to keep farmers' markets relevant and accessible to those with low incomes. Ms. LaViolette said that some markets, like one on 125th Street in Harlem, were often passed over by poorer residents who carried the perception that fresh produce was always more expensive than more fatty foods.
But the grants provided to these markets give them money to install card readers for food stamps, and food-stamp users are given incentives for buying at markets. One provision at participating markets gives buyers a $2 coupon for every $5 in benefits spent at a market.
As for the Crown Heights market, organizers are unsure what will happen without Mr. Hildebrant, who was one of two farmers at the market and who died after a long battle with melanoma. He brought several workers from his farm to help operate it, and they will continue to come.
Mr. Hildebrant was known for growing delicious tomatoes, but he rarely tried them himself. ''I was always the taste tester,'' Ms. Hildebrant said laughing.
Nancie Katz, executive director of Seeds in the Middle, the organization that operates the market, said he was a reliable farmer and partner.
''When I couldn't be there, Roy was running it for me,'' she said. ''I knew he was there. I always knew he would be there.''
Workers at his farm say they plan to keep the Crown Heights Farmers Market going as long as they can, but the absence of the man who wore John Deere caps and tattered jeans is palpable.
''He wore many hats,'' Ms. Hildebrant said.

HEADLINE: Chargers Lineman to Miss Four Games in Suspension

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The N.F.L. said Thursday that San Diego Chargers defensive tackle Garrett Brown had been suspended without pay for the team's first four regular-season games for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing substances.Brown, who signed as a free agent, will be eligible to return to the Chargers' active roster on Oct. 1.
The league said Brown was eligible to participate in all preseason practices and exhibition games. 
BRONCOS LINEBACKER EXCUSED Linebacker D. J. Williams was excused from the Denver Broncos' practice for personal reasons, a day after he was convicted on two charges in a Denver court.
Williams was found guilty Wednesday of driving while ability-impaired and driving without his headlights, the offense that prompted the police to stop him near downtown Denver about 3 a.m. on Nov. 12, 2010. Already facing a six-game drug suspension, Williams is subject to further punishment from the N.F.L. because of the impaired driving conviction. The league said it would review the matter.
The team's leading tackler in five of his eight seasons in Denver, Williams has not been working with the starters during camp while the Broncos prepare his replacement, Wesley Woodyard, for the season.
LEAGUE PROVIDES EVIDENCE The N.F.L. has provided a federal judge with what it says is evidence that Commissioner Roger Goodell did not improperly prejudge players in the bounty investigation.
The evidence includes a copy of a letter the N.F.L. Players Association sent the league on March 7 asking Goodell to delay punishment of players implicated in the bounty probe. It also includes a sworn declaration from Goodell in which he states he was prepared to hand down player discipline at the same time he announced suspensions for coaches and executives on March 21. Goodell's declaration states he held off after verbally agreeing to do so in a phone conversation with the union's executive director, DeMaurice Smith.
YOUNG ORDERED TO PAY Quarterback Vince Young has been ordered to pay a loan company nearly $1.7 million after missing a payment in late May, shortly after signing with the Buffalo Bills.
The ruling against Young was made in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on July 2, according to court documents.
Young took out a high-risk loan from Pro Player Funding for $1.877 million in May 2011, during the N.F.L. lockout, while he was under contract with the Tennessee Titans. The loan, plus $619,000 in interest, was due to be paid back in January 2013 at an annual interest rate of 20 percent. That rate jumped another 10 percent if Young missed a payment.
NEW DEAL FOR TEXANS TACKLE The Houston Texans have signed left tackle Duane Brown to a new contract. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
The 6-foot-4, 320-pound Brown has started all but four games since the Texans drafted him with the 26th overall pick in 2008.
BROWNS DEFEAT PACKERS The rookie quarterback Brandon Weeden showed improvement in his second preseason game, avoiding major mistakes as Cleveland beat Green Bay, 35-10, at Lambeau Field.
Aaron Rodgers looked sharp in limited action, but the backup quarterback Graham Harrell was shaky for the Packers.
Weeden, a first-round pick out of Oklahoma State who already has been chosen the Browns' starter, played the first half and was 12 of 20 for 118 yards.
BENGALS EDGE FALCONS Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton and the Falcons' Matt Ryan each directed a pair of scoring drives before Cincinnati's reserves held on for a 24-19 preseason victory in Atlanta.
Ryan, who completed his first 11 attempts, finished 18 of 21 for 174 yards and one touchdown, a 2-yard screen to Lousaka Polite in the second quarter.
Dalton was 8 of 14 for 125 yards and one touchdown, a 50-yard pass that A. J. Green caught while running past Asante Samuel down the right sideline.
OWENS TO MAKE SEATTLE DEBUT Terrell Owens will make his debut for the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday when they travel to Denver for a preseason game against the Broncos.

HEADLINE: New Operator Is Chosen for Tavern on the Green

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
More than two years after the legendary Central Park restaurant Tavern on the Green closed and its once-luxurious appointments were auctioned off, the parks department has selected a new, Philadelphia-based operator that plans to reopen the space as a smaller, more rustic restaurant in the fall of 2013.''The hope is that it will not be only a destination, but a place that will serve the neighborhood and locals who use the park every day,'' said Katy Sparks, the new executive chef, who has worked in New York City since the 1980s.
Although the footprint of the restaurant will be smaller than the final incarnation of the old Tavern on the Green, there will, nonetheless, be room for 300 guests inside, an additional 200 to 300 outside and a takeout window selling smoothies, sandwiches and picnic fare. 
The new operator, the Emerald Green Group, runs the Philadelphia restaurant Beau Monde, a popular bistro with 70 seats. Its principals, Jim Caiola and David Salama, are both chefs. Since her last restaurant closed in 2002, Ms. Sparks, who is known for her clean, New American culinary style, has been working as a consultant, developing local and sustainable menus for restaurants and companies like Sodexo.
About a half-dozen companies bid for the chance to develop a restaurant, including Legends Hospitality Management, which runs the Legends Suite Club and all food catering at Yankee Stadium; City Winery, a restaurant in downtown Manhattan for lovers of wine and music; and Park Street Ventures, an investment partnership in Essex Fells, N.J.
But New York's high-powered restaurateurs did not submit proposals, a reflection of the building's condition, the challenges of working with the city government, early disputes over the ownership of the lease and the restaurant's name, and parks department limitations on catered events.
''I think the city really wanted to redefine what the Tavern is going to be,'' said Drew Nieporent, who was the director of Tavern on the Green from 1978 to 1982, when it was a prime destination for parties and celebrities. ''They don't want private events. They don't want music. They want something that will blend in, not stand out.''
A parks department spokesman, Philip Abramson, confirmed that the city's goal for the site was to provide an informal, accessible restaurant that would harmonize with its bucolic setting. To that end, Ms. Sparks said, her menu will draw extensively on local farms and products: squid from Montauk, foie gras from the Hudson Valley and chocolate made by the Mast Brothers of Brooklyn.
The city, not the Emerald Green Group, is paying the nearly $10 million bill for the structural and exterior work that will restore the building to its original design. It was built by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould in the 19th century as a sheepfold for the 200 sheep that grazed in the Sheep Meadow nearby. As parks commissioner in the 1930s, Robert Moses converted the building into a (low-earning) restaurant, and in the 1970s, the impresario Warner LeRoy transformed it into a glittering, rococo showpiece. But business faltered in the economic downturn of the past several years; the Crystal Room, which was built over the original building's courtyard, was dismantled in 2010.
The group has a signed letter of agreement with the restaurant workers' union, the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, the first step toward a contract. Negotiations with the union, among other factors, derailed the first operator awarded the contract for the Tavern: Dean J. Poll, who runs the Boathouse restaurant nearby.
Stephen Starr, who operates large restaurants in Philadelphia, New York and Florida, said he was surprised by the city's choice of the operator of a small bistro. ''It's a daunting task, to go from 70 to 600 seats, but you never know,'' he said. ''Rocky beat Apollo Creed in the end.''

HEADLINE: New Operator Is Chosen for Tavern on the Green

BYLINE: By JULIA MOSKIN

 BODY:
More than two years after the legendary Central Park restaurant Tavern on the Green closed and its once-luxurious appointments were auctioned, the Parks Department has selected a Philadelphia-based operator that plans to reopen the space as a smaller, more rustic restaurant in the fall of 2013."The hope is that it will not be only a destination, but a place that will serve the neighborhood and locals who use the park every day," said Katy Sparks, the new executive chef, who has worked in New York City since the 1980s.
Although the footprint of the restaurant will be smaller than the last incarnation of Tavern on the Green, there will nonetheless be room for 300 guests inside, another 200 to 300 outside, and a takeout window selling smoothies, sandwiches and other picnic fare. 
The new operator, Emerald Green Group, runs the Philadelphia restaurant Beau Monde, a popular bistro with 70 seats. Its principals, Jim Caiola and David Salama, are both chefs and artists. Since her last restaurant closed in 2002, Ms. Sparks -- known for her clean, new American culinary style -- has been working as a consultant, developing local and sustainable menus for restaurants and companies like Sodexho.
About a half-dozen companies bid for the chance to develop a restaurant, including Legends Hospitality Management, which runs the Legends Club and suite-and-seat catering at Yankee Stadium; City Winery, a restaurant on Varick Street in Manhattan for lovers of wine and music; and Park Street Ventures, an investment partnership in Essex Fells, N.J. But New York's highest-powered restaurateurs did not submit proposals, based on the condition of the building, the challenges of working with the city government, early disputes over the ownership of the lease and the restaurant's name, and parks department limitations on catered events.
Drew Nieporent, who was the director of the Tavern on the Green from 1978 to 1982, when it was a prime destination for parties and celebrities, said: "I think the city really wanted to redefine what the tavern is going to be. They don't want private events, they don't want music, they want something that will blend in, not stand out."
A parks department spokesman, Philip Abramson, said the city's goal for the site was an informal, accessible restaurant that would harmonize with its bucolic setting. To that end, Ms. Sparks, said, her menu will draw extensively on local farms and products: squid from Montauk, foie gras from the Hudson Valley, and chocolate made by Brooklyn's Mast Brothers.
The city, not Emerald Green Group, is footing the nearly $10 million bill for the structural and exterior work that will restore the building to its original design. It was built by Calvert Vaux and Jacob Wrey Mould in the 19th century as a sheepfold for the 200 sheep that grazed in the nearby Sheep Meadow. As parks commisioner in the 1930s, Robert Moses converted the building to a (low-earning) restaurant, and in the 1970s, the impresario Warner LeRoy transformed it into a glittering, rococo showpiece. But business faltered in the economic downturn of the last several years; the Crystal Room, which was built over the original building's courtyard, was dismantled in 2010.
The group has a signed letter of agreement with the restaurant workers' union, the first step toward a contract. Negotiations with the union, among other factors, ultimately derailed the first operator awarded the contract for the Tavern: Dean J. Poll, who runs the nearby Central Park Boathouse.
Stephen Starr, who operates large restaurants in Philadelphia, New York and Florida, said he was surprised by the city's choosing the operator of a small bistro. "It's a daunting task, to go from 70 to 600 seats, but you never know," he said. "Rocky beat Apollo Creed in the end."

HEADLINE: How America Can Slow Israel's March to War

BYLINE: By DENNIS B. ROSS. 
Dennis B. Ross, a former State Department and National Security Council official, was a special assistant to President Obama for the Middle East and South Asia from 2009 to 2011. He is now a counselor at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

 BODY:
WashingtonOBAMA administration officials have made it clear that they believe there is still time and space for diplomatic efforts to succeed in stopping Iran from achieving a nuclear weapons capability. But Israel's deputy foreign minister, Danny Ayalon, has said it is time to declare that ''diplomacy has failed.''
While Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has not yet declared the failure of diplomacy, he has spoken about its inability to alter the course of Iran's nuclear program. In addition, he has told his cabinet that the nuclear threat from Iran dwarfs all the other threats Israel faces and pointedly added, ''Iran cannot be allowed to have nuclear weapons.'' 
The words of Israeli leaders are signaling not just increasing impatience with the pace of diplomacy but also Israel's growing readiness to act militarily on its own against Iranian nuclear facilities.
Although the United States and Israel share the same objective of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability, the two differ on the point at which it may become necessary to act militarily to forestall the Iranian nuclear advance. I say ''forestall'' because neither America nor Israel can fully destroy the Iranian capability to build a nuclear weapon. Each country could set Iran back militarily, but neither could destroy Iran's skill or technical and engineering capacity to develop nuclear weapons. Since 2007, when Iran mastered the full nuclear fuel cycle and the means to enrich uranium on its own, it has been too late for that.
Their differences on the possible timing of military action are a function of both capabilities and perspective. The United States has significantly greater military might than Israel and therefore feels that it can wait substantially longer than Israel before resorting to force.
Israel is less patient. As Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak has said, Iran is rapidly approaching the moment when the depth, breadth and hardening of its multiple nuclear facilities would produce a ''zone of immunity'' in which an Israeli military strike would lose its effectiveness. Mr. Barak believes that Israel must act before that moment.
But the issue for the United States is not only about military capacity. It is also about having a strategy for the aftermath of any strike on Iran. Because force could not destroy Iran's nuclear capability, military action must be seen as a means and not an end. And it must be employed in a way that would contribute to the objective of setting back the Iranian nuclear program so that Iran is both less able and less willing to reconstitute it. At a minimum, that would require keeping Iran isolated and under severe economic sanctions after its nuclear facilities had been attacked.
Israel surely recognizes the importance of having a post-strike strategy that could succeed in keeping Iran isolated. But, perhaps because Israeli leaders find it difficult to surrender the military option while still facing what they perceive as an existential threat, they tend to believe that Tehran's behavior will produce a unified international position against Iran, even after a military strike.
In the words of one senior Israeli official: ''The sanctions regime may be hurt for a time, but afterward it will recover, as will the diplomatic pressure on Iran, as will the intelligence battle against Iran. This is because the basic interests of the international community regarding Iran will not change.''
The perspective of the Obama administration is different. From its standpoint, the isolation of Iran did not just happen on its own. It took considerable effort to persuade and mobilize the international community to impose crippling sanctions.
For the United States, this context matters. America thinks in terms of shaping an international environment so that if force becomes necessary it can be justified because diplomacy has been demonstrably exhausted and Iran, by stubbornly refusing to alter its nuclear program, will appear to have essentially brought war on itself. Preserving Iran's isolation in the event of a military strike will require denying Iran the ability to present itself as the victim.
In other words, before a military strike, it is essential to demonstrate that Iran was not prepared to accept a civil nuclear power capability with the kind of limitations that would prevent it from being able to produce nuclear weapons on short notice.
Israeli leaders wouldn't dispute the desirability of showing that diplomacy -- and the use of crippling sanctions -- had failed to change Iran's behavior. But Israelis clearly fear that their clock will run out on them and that Israel, in the words of that senior official, ''will no longer be a player at that point.''
The key questions for policy makers in Washington today are whether there is a way to extend the clock from an Israeli standpoint and whether it is possible to synchronize the American and Israeli clocks so that we really can exhaust diplomacy and sanctions before resorting to force. Four actions by the United States could make this possible.
First, the United States must put an endgame proposal on the table that would allow Iran to have civil nuclear power but with restrictions that would preclude it from having a breakout nuclear capability -- the ability to weaponize its nuclear program rapidly at a time of Tehran's choosing. Making such a proposal would clarify whether a genuine deal was possible and would convey to Israel that the American approach to negotiations was not open-ended.
Second, America should begin discussions with the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany (the so called P5+1) about a ''day after'' strategy in the event that diplomacy fails and force is used. This would signal to both Israel and Iran that we mean what we say about all options being on the table.
Third, senior American officials should ask Israeli leaders if there are military capabilities we could provide them with -- like additional bunker-busting bombs, tankers for refueling aircraft and targeting information -- that would extend the clock for them.
And finally, the White House should ask Mr. Netanyahu what sort of support he would need from the United States if he chose to use force -- for example, resupply of weapons, munitions, spare parts, military and diplomatic backing, and help in terms of dealing with unexpected contingencies. The United States should be prepared to make firm commitments in all these areas now in return for Israel's agreement to postpone any attack until next year -- a delay that could be used to exhaust diplomatic options and lay the groundwork for military action if diplomacy failed.
Although some may argue that these actions will make a military strike more likely next year, they are almost certainly needed now in order to give Israel's leaders a reason to wait.

HEADLINE: For Europe's Tepid Economy, a Lost Decade Looms

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The euro zone is hurtling back into recession, economists declared after official figures this week portrayed a shrinking economy. But by some measures the downturn has been under way for years.With the exception of Germany, none of Europe's biggest economies have returned to the level of economic output they had at the beginning of 2008, before the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States spread across the Atlantic, according to calculations by two U.S. economists, Peter Rupert and Thomas F. Cooley.
