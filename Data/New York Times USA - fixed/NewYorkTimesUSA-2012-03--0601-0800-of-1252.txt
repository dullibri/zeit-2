HEADLINE: Want to See Cuba? Your Museum Might Take You

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
SOME large American museums, and an increasing number of smaller ones, offer domestic and international trips -- with Cuba currently all the rage -- that enliven the museums' images and at the same time help increase membership and raise money. 
Some are major institutions, like the Metropolitan Museum in New York City and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, which offer tours to Cuba and other destinations where travel can be difficult to arrange individually.
But even the much smaller Woodson Art Museum in Wausau, Wis., is about to roll out a Cuba trip. Ruth Schuette, a property manager who is a member of the museum, said she was eager to join it because ''I didn't want to take a chance of going there through Canada or someplace else.''
Also, she said, ''I did not want to have to do all the homework myself, and I know from my previous museum trips that I will be part of a like-minded group interested in similar experiences, and we will keep in touch afterwards about the trip.''
Museum trips cost $4,000 to $10,000, with the trips to Cuba falling at the lower end of the scale. Smithsonian Journeys, a giant in the museum travel field, operates about 180 trips annually, and some of the proceeds go to the institution's research and exhibitions. The institution was a museum travel pioneer, beginning its trips in 1970. Like many museums, it offered -- and still does when asked -- exclusive trips for donors and board members, but the Smithsonian also helped democratize museum trips by offering them broadly to the public.
At first, the Smithsonian had four trips a year, with up to 180 people on a chartered Boeing 707, accompanied by academic experts. The idea was so new that Amy Kotkin, longtime director of Smithsonian Journeys, recalled, ''Once Pan Am agents, in uniform, came to the Smithsonian Castle and checked everyone in.''
By the 1980s, the Smithsonian began to offer more varied trips for smaller groups, typically around two dozen people. The program, like most travel, suffered during the recession, but is now steadily adding destinations, with Cuba trips brimming with interested travelers. Trips to Cuba require a license from the Treasury Department and are reserved for groups that can provide education and culture-rich programs.
''We're not on the cutting edge of adventures like climbing a mountain,'' Ms. Kotkin said. ''We focus on lifelong learning, and offer soft adventure in places like Peru, Bhutan, India, China and lots of other destinations, and now Cuba.''
Emily Van Agtmael, an interior designer in Maryland, who returned from a Corcoran tour of Cuba last week, said the docent whom the museum chose to explain the country's national museum, ''made all the difference; with her, we could really appreciate what was in the collection.''
All museum trips are called ''friend raisers,'' said Merle Lomrantz, director of the Newark Museum's active member travel program, where more than 1,200 of the museum's 5,000 member households have participated in its domestic or international trips.
''What we have found is that the trips encourage members to become more interested in the museum, to raise their membership level and become patrons,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Trade: Jobs Bill Will Provide Help, but for All the Wrong People

BYLINE: By JESSE EISINGER. 
Jesse Eisinger is a reporter for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest. E-mail: jesse@propublica.org Twitter: @eisingerj.

 BODY:
Finally, the House passed a jobs bill last week. And what a bill it is!
Officially called the Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups Act, it calls for reopening our capital markets to exciting new start-ups by ridding protections for investors and stripping away disclosure requirements for smaller companies.
JOBS has been repeatedly assailed, but it will bring much-needed help to some of the harder hit sectors of the economy. 
John Coffee, a Columbia Law professor, has hailed the bill as ''the boiler room legalization act.'' And rightly so. Boiler room operations were one of the unsung job creators of the 1990s, producing some of America's greatest penny stocks and boom times for yacht makers and coke dealers.
But these small, hard-working firms have run into hard times. Areas of Long Island and Boca Raton, Fla., still have not recovered since the heyday of the Nasdaq. How long must a lost generation of Lamborghini-loving 20-somethings suffer while their talents for talking quickly go to waste?
Congress is on the case, with Democrats and Republicans working together at last. It's not just the House. The Senate is expected to pass a similar bill this week.
Since the technology stock blowup, the accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, investors have been needlessly wary of putting their savings into fledgling companies offered by Wall Street banks.
The JOBS bill fixes that. Taking advantage of the revolutionary possibilities of the Internet, the bill loosens decades-old investor protections so that companies can directly advertise to those who would like to be separated from their money. It does that by giving broad exemptions for start-ups that want to ''crowdfund'' by raising small amounts of money over the Internet. I.P.O. pitches next to ''Lose Your Belly!'' ads. Sounds like a great idea!
Nigeria shouldn't be the only country to benefit from the Web. Right here in America, the elderly are increasingly attractive to a variety of entrepreneurial spirits. If JOBS becomes the law, such innovators could flourish.
Let's not forget Wall Street analysts. Once, men and women could make a good living by stamping glowing ratings on companies offering stock to the public for the first time, even if they secretly believed those companies were dogs. You could even become famous, like Jack Grubman or Henry Blodget.
Ever since the cleanup back then by the New York State attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, analysts have lost some luster. With JOBS enacted, Wall Street analysts will once again be able to shill for the companies that their own investment banks are shepherding through the initial public offering process.
And then there are the short-sellers, the type of investor who ferrets out the overvalued companies, the hype stories and stock frauds.
It's been about a year now since Chinese reverse-merger companies collapsed. In that scandal, dozens of those small Chinese companies went public in the United States without having to run the gantlet of the Securities and Exchange Commission's registration rules.
After they blew up by the boatload, the S.E.C. cracked down and tightened its rules.
Since then, short-sellers' pickings have been slim. By allowing newly public small companies to refrain from disclosing financial information for years, the bill will provide new targets for short-selling hedge funds.
Clearly, the many critics of the law underestimate what a boon this will be. Sure, it would be better not to have the scams in the first place. But now short-sellers will now be able to use their talents to uncover fraud that might not have occurred without JOBS. Capital will pour into this sector of the economy.
Finally, one shouldn't underestimate how tough things have been for lobbyists promoting financial deregulation. Not in finding work, of course. Legions of civic-minded lawyers have found gainful employment helping banks desperately fight the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul.
But these people have suffered no end of social embarrassment. When they go to cocktail parties and say their job is to protect banks from regulations that hurt America, people have been known to laugh.
Now, the lobbyists can point out that even the White House agrees. The Obama administration has backed JOBS and is on the same page as the banks when it comes to the message: safe, tightly regulated capital markets don't instill confidence in investors, but rather stifle ingenuity and creativity. Expect these same arguments to come up again in the push to revise Dodd-Frank. That's change we can believe in.
And, anyway, trust and confidence are overrated. Wild West markets are more thrilling. If Americans thought otherwise, Las Vegas casinos would have the buy-and-hold room next to the roulette wheels.
Then again, for entertainment, our capital markets just cannot compete with Congress.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Set Aside a Day for Museums? Minnesota Thinks Bigger

BYLINE: By CAROL KINO

 BODY:
MAY is typically the month for honoring mothers, the armed forces and the flowering of spring. In Minnesota, May is now Minnesota Museums Month, the country's first monthlong, statewide celebration of museums. It is the creation of several Twin Cities museum administrators, who expect it to become an annual event.
''There are stories that we each try to tell individually, whenever a special exhibition is happening,'' said Phillip Bahar, the chief of operations at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. ''What we want to do is tell the stories that we don't have the opportunity to tell very often, about the broader community of museums across the state.'' 
This particular story begins with this year's annual meeting of the American Association of Museums, to be held in Minneapolis-St. Paul from April 29 to May 2. Typically, committees in the host city meet for months in advance to plan events and activities for attendees. But not for nothing is Minneapolis known as the Emerald City of philanthropy; from the beginning, many of the organizers were determined to do more.
''Phillip and I felt that if we were going to spend a lot of time on this, we should do something that's durable,'' said Bruce Karstadt, the president of the American Swedish Institute in Minneapolis. (He and Mr. Bahar are chairmen of the public relations and marketing subcommittee.)
Anne-Marie Wagener, the director of public relations at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and another subcommittee member, agreed. ''It's great to have a conference with our peers,'' she said. ''But we wanted a public component, beyond the boost it gives to the economy.''
A native of Glasgow, she thought immediately of the Edinburgh Festival. Formed in 1947, it began as a proclaimed ''gesture of cultural defiance in a world made weary by war, misery and destruction,'' immediately spawned the Festival Fringe and later added art exhibits, book fairs and the like to become the largest cultural festival in the world.
''I grew up with it and I was aware of its potency,'' Ms. Wagener said. She mentioned it to the committee and the idea struck a nerve. ''We basically looked around the room and said, 'Is everybody on board for really trying to make a go of this as a designated month?' '' The answer was yes.
The rich history of Minnesota's museums invites such a focus. It started with the Minnesota Historical Society in St. Paul, founded in 1849, when Minnesota was still a territory. In 1872, the legislature established the state's first science museum in Minneapolis, now known as the James Ford Bell Museum of Natural History. (Coincidentally, it is named for the grandfather of Ford Bell, the current president of the American Association of Museums.)
In 1879, the Walker Art Gallery opened -- the first art museum west of the Mississippi -- founded by the lumber magnate Thomas Barlow Walker in his own home. In 1940 it was re-established as the Walker Art Center, a community art center run by the Works Project Administration. The Minneapolis Institute of Arts, today one of America's major encyclopedic museums, opened its doors in 1915.
The network also extends far beyond the Twin Cities. Minnesota has about 600 museums, giving it twice as many per capita as the national average, according to Lin Nelson-Mayson, chairwoman of the Minnesota Association of Museums and director of the Goldstein Museum of Design at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. ''Minnesota is a state that's always valued culture and heritage,'' she said.
Not only does each county have its own historical society and museum, but there are also gems like the Minnesota Marine Art Museum in Winona, whose holdings include a little-known but important cache of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist seascapes; celebrity childhood home museums, like the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, run primarily by volunteers; and oddball historical one-offs, like the Spam Museum in Austin and the fascinating William & Joan Soderlund Pharmacy Museum, another volunteer labor of love housed in a drugstore in St. Peter.
The state also has several Native American sites overseen by the Minnesota Historical Society, one of which is Mille Lacs Indian Museum and Trading Post on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation in central Minnesota. Founded as a Native American trading post in 1918, the building is still functioning, while a newer museum building tells the history of the local Ojibwe band.
''We're not really close to any major populated areas, so it's always nice to have something like this to let people know we're here,'' Travis Zimmerman, who manages the site, said of Minnesota Museums Month.
This year's celebration will consist primarily of this sort of consciousness-raising. In early May, local public television stations will start screening the documentary, ''Museums Creating Community,'' which will run through the month. There will be special museum sections in the Star Tribune, Mpls.St.Paul Magazine and the Web site of Explore Minnesota, the state tourism bureau. Information about the state's museums will also be consolidated on a new Web site, museumsmonth.org, which will go online soon.
The organizers expect to expand the celebration next year, but they don't yet know exactly how. ''On June 1 we'll start figuring that out,'' said Mr. Bahar. ''Right now we're working on May.''

HEADLINE: Come for the Art, Stay for the Shopping

BYLINE: By DOROTHY SPEARS

 BODY:
DRAWING on her experience as co-owner of the lifestyle store Zona, Franci Sagar has created an environment at the Museum of Arts and Design in which it is tempting to linger.
Music like James Taylor's ''Sweet Baby James'' plays softly through the Midtown museum's small, light-filled store. One-of-a-kind objects and personal accessories offer an array of textures, materials and colors. Books are kept to a minimum; they can be bought online. Most remarkably, however, reproductions of artworks from the permanent collection, a mainstay at most museum stores, are visibly absent.
''We don't do reproductions here. That's not suitable for our mission,'' said Ms. Sagar, the museum's vice president and director of retail and brand management. 
Since the museum collects and exhibits jewelry -- and even has a jewelry curator -- its store presents a triple-tiered display showcasing artist-made designs of wood, metal, beads, resin, horn and embroidery. Other objects on display -- glass vases that mimic Ziploc bags and polymer placemats, as well as felted silk scarves and blouses made by an artist in Istanbul who began her career as a chemical engineer -- reveal an equally intriguing use of materials.
''Our whole mission is about living artists and process and materials, so the store completely fits with who we are as a museum,'' said Holly Hotchner, the museum's director. She added that with only 1,300 square feet of space, and gross annual sales hovering around $3 million, ''per foot we probably have one of the most economically successful museum stores in America.''
Gone are the days when the shelves of museum stores were limited to exhibition catalogs, magnets and souvenir coffee mugs. With museums nationwide increasingly bent on establishing their individual brands, their stores have become more sophisticated, according to Ms. Sagar, who also advises the Miami Art Museum, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, the Gardiner Museum in Toronto and the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia.
For example, the online store of the Guggenheim Museum, whose Frank Lloyd Wright building draws crowds of foreign tourists, has recently offered for sale a line of jewelry by the designer Andrea Panico, created in partnership with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. The jewelry is ''interpretive of the building,'' said Karen Meyerhoff, the museum's managing director for business development. There is also a building-inspired Lego model. A high-end paint line, licensed through Fine Paints of Europe and sold at the store as a deck of swatches, includes shades of white used on the Guggenheim's exterior, colors used in the galleries, and even the red color of the elevator.
Artists exhibiting at the museum also regularly make limited-edition artworks for sale through the store, because, Ms. Meyerhoff said, ''we feel it really grounds the store in the mission of the museum to have real art on the walls.''
Stuart D. Gerstein, director of wholesale and retail operations at the Philadelphia Museum of Art, said the creative climate among museum stores had encouraged him to provide ''an experience that is, hopefully, as interesting as the exhibition, that relates to the exhibition, and that helps complete the exhibition.''
Last year, for example, in conjunction with ''Roberto Capucci: Art Into Fashion,'' the Philadelphia museum's store sold small-scale versions of Mr. Capucci's dresses, all of which were hand-sewn at the designer's couture house in Italy. Priced at $3,800, Mr. Capucci's collectible dresses were made with high-end buyers in mind. (Members, who tend to return to the museum several times a year, make up the bulk of its annual visitors, Mr. Gerstein said.)
But even less expensive items reflect an effort to evoke what he called ''a unique retail experience.'' For ''Van Gogh Up Close,'' which runs through May 6, the store offers specialty items from the Netherlands, like Dutch tiles and pottery, waffles filled with syrup, and a chocolate paste for spreading on bread, as well as products conjuring the south of France like Provencal soaps, linens and perfumed sprays.
''Whether van Gogh was eating or smelling these things we don't know. But in terms of sales, that's been going really well,'' Mr. Gerstein said.
At newer institutions, like the Rubin Museum of Art in Manhattan, visitor experience looms particularly large. The Rubin, whose collection and exhibitions focus on the art of the Himalayas, is in the process of opening a hop and cafe. Its name, Serai, refers to a caravanserai -- a resting stop along ancient trade routes, where travelers could take refreshment and exchange merchandise, according to Patrick Sears, the museum's deputy director.
Surrounded by Himalayan music and the aroma of exotic spices, customers at Serai, scheduled to open this month, will be able to choose among artisanal woven textiles and handcrafted jewelry, and stay for tiffin, a light meal. Serai's role as a profit center is less important than its potential for establishing the Rubin's brand, Mr. Sears said. ''We want people to understand who we are.''
Even established institutions like the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, are finding fresh ways to identify themselves, according to Ellen Bragalone, its director of retail operations. Since the opening of the museum's new contemporary art wing last fall, for example, the store has begun enlisting students, faculty and alumni of its affiliated School of the Museum of Fine Arts in the production of artist-made lines.
In the last year the museum was lucky in that one alumnus was Brian Burkhardt, whose jewelry won the top prize on ''Project Accessory,'' a reality TV show, Ms. Bragalone said. Although the final episode was not broadcast until last November, she said the store offered Mr. Burkhardt's audition piece for sale beginning in September. Earnings at museum stores vary, depending on overhead and expenses. But the Boston store grossed $6.9 million in the 2011 fiscal year that ended last June, a figure that ranks third in earned revenue at the museum, behind school tuition and membership, according to a museum representative.
And if reproductions of favorite paintings on mugs and tote bags are likely to remain a reliable source of income at most museums, ''visitors today want new, and different, and more,'' said Mr. Gerstein in Philadelphia.

HEADLINE: Shares End Mostly Flat as the S.&P. Breaks Its Winning Streak

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended lower Wednesday, breaking a five-day streak of gains, as investors found little reason to extend a rally that took the benchmark index to four-year highs.
Attention turned to the bond market, where the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell more than a percentage point, sending the interest rate up more than one-third of a percentage point, to the highest level since October. 
The Federal Reserve's brighter economic outlook and recent stock market strength drove investors away from government debt, and rates rose for a sixth straight session.
The surge in yields raised questions about the possible end to a long, steady Treasuries rally that has been driven by the euro zone debt crisis and a United States economy that has struggled with high unemployment.
Mostly positive stress test results for the nation's banking sector, announced by the Fed late Tuesday afternoon, also undermined the Treasury market's safe-haven appeal.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 1 9/32, to 97 19/32, and the yield rose to 2.27 percent from 2.13 percent late Tuesday.
While the major stock averages ended essentially flat, three stocks fell for every gainer on the New York Stock Exchange, a sign that investors were pulling back from gains that had lifted numerous blue chips to 52-week highs. Procter & Gamble hit a 52-week high at $67.95 before dipping 0.1 percent to close at $67.85. Chevron climbed to a 52-week high at $112.28 during the session, but slipped 0.5 percent to $110.69.
The S.&P. 500 hit an intraday high of 1,399.42, its highest level since early June 2008, before dropping in the afternoon.
Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, noted that so-called higher beta stocks -- those that outperform broader averages -- were not holding up as well, which he said was ''often indicative of a market that is struggling to maintain momentum.''
Momentum continued for Apple, limiting losses in big-cap averages. Shares of Apple surged for a sixth straight day, climbing 3.8 percent to $589.58 following positive comments from analysts. Morgan Stanley and Canaccord Genuity both lifted their price targets on the stock to above $700.
''We do worry that the move in Apple has been a little too much, too fast, as the fear is that as shares rise, expectations will get overly optimistic,'' said Channing Smith, a portfolio manager of the Capital Advisors Growth Fund.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.42 points, or 0.12 percent, to 13,194.10. The S.&P. 500 slipped 1.67 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,394.28. The Nasdaq composite index inched up 0.85 of a point, or 0.03 percent, to 3,040.73.
Bank stocks, a major component of the S.&P. 500's 11 percent gain for the year, led a late-day surge in Tuesday's rally after JPMorgan Chase announced it would raise its dividend. The KBW Bank index continued its rally on Wednesday, up 1.3 percent, and is now 22 percent higher this year.
''JPMorgan's news yesterday was so unexpected that it had a disproportionate effect on the market,'' Mr. McCain said. ''We were looking for an excuse to move higher, and we found it.''
The Fed said Tuesday that most of the nation's largest banks had passed their annual stress tests of capital strength. But the report called out a few that failed, like Citigroup, whose shares fell 3.4 percent, to $35.21, on Wednesday.
The Fed also forecast ''moderate'' growth over coming quarters with the unemployment rate declining gradually versus the modest growth it said it expected in January. The change in language was seen as a slight upgrade of the economic outlook.
The increasing optimism about the American economy helped lift the dollar to an 11-month high against the yen and a one-month high versus the euro.

HEADLINE: A Barefoot Rebellion Storms Lincoln Center

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
The Paul Taylor Dance Company season that opened at the David H. Koch Theater on Tuesday night is historic. Bringing this great troupe to Lincoln Center for its first season there, it shows how richly this company's dancing projects into the heights and depths of the multitier house: a marvel. If you're used to watching dance in the Koch Theater, then you can't help feeling that the three dimensions of its stage space come alive in unfamiliar ways; the very air onstage seems to have a new texture.
Less happily, the troupe's first season at Lincoln Center will be completely accompanied by taped music. The New York musicians' union has denounced the company for performing without an orchestra; some of the union's members distributed leaflets on Tuesday night. (Mr. Taylor's troupe, which used to have an orchestra for four-week seasons at City Center years ago, is now caught between devil and deep blue sea -- between the live music it, like many dance companies, can no longer afford and the recordings that change both the acoustics and spontaneity of performance.) 
All seats on Tuesday were priced at $3.50, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of ''Aureole,'' a work that helped to change the history of modern dance. (In 1962 $3.50 was the top price.) Mr. Taylor had performed with Merce Cunningham and Martha Graham. Then, in an act both rebellious and conservative, he took the barefoot modern-dance style he knew (largely that of Graham), and connected it to the rhythm and structure of mainstream concert-hall music (Handel), thereby releasing a lyrical momentum and rhythmic responsiveness in the style that had been forgotten.
To some of his artistic colleagues this was a sellout, a decision to be popular rather than original; and they never forgave him. (They included John Cage, who had dedicated a piece of music to him, and Robert Rauschenberg, who had been his designer on several important occasions. Those chapters in Mr. Taylor's life closed.) But Mr. Taylor's decision released an outpouring of lyrical musicality in many modern-dance works of the last half-century: not just his own, but those by Twyla Tharp, Mark Morris and more. He has often worked against his music in one way or another; and some of his pieces either use unconventional scores or make no rhythmic connection to their accompaniment.
''Aureole,'' however, initiated a new orthodoxy, which soon positioned Mr. Taylor at the center of American modern dance. Yet until Tuesday night the Taylor company hadn't performed it in years. Since Mr. Taylor is among the master choreographers of modern dance, I was looking forward to watching the revival as an important piece of Taylor history. (''Oh, so that's how he was thinking then.'') He has choreographed successfully to many works of Baroque music since ''Aureole''; thanks to them (not least his most beloved work, ''Esplanade,'' which is set to five movements from Bach concertos) I was expecting to find it a period piece.
Certainly ''Aureole,'' as presented on Tuesday, resonates with history. You can still feel in it that the young Mr. Taylor here is addressing America's two then-dominant choreographers, Balanchine and Graham. Balanchine had choreographed a solo in ''Episodes'' (1959) for him and then had invited him to dance the title role in his ''Apollo'' (1928); Graham had featured Mr. Taylor as a leading member of her company for the past seven years. ''Aureole'' evokes the rough-hewn naive classicism of some of the ''Apollo'' sequences for one man and three women; and it employs the dance phraseology of some Graham passages.
But those are just incidental points of interest. This ''Aureole'' is a fresh young world of its own. A particular pleasure is the way its musicality, while irresistible, keeps taking you by surprise. (Some phrases seem to move at half the music's speed, and some moments seem to dam the music's current altogether.) There are many friendly oddities. Anybody seeing it for the first time can parody some of the striding steps, with arms swung in opposition, that get repeated (partly because those strides have gotten under your skin), but they're part and parcel of this work's innocent ebullience.
Best of all are the texture and dynamics of the dancing. In the role Mr. Taylor made for himself, Michael Trusnovec -- a great dancer now in the high summer of his talent -- makes you feel the choreography's shapes, arcs, shifts of weight, phrases are newly made. The opening of his arms from a halo position, the luxuriant rigor with which his body hovered amid a simple transfer of weight from one foot to the other: these registered with powerful beauty throughout the big theater, every bit as wonderful as his most athletic and virtuoso flights.
Perhaps more than any dancer alive, Mr. Trusnovec is an authoritative model of stylistic economy. Every movement he makes is ardently decisive, devoid of all excess or waste, pared down to the essence.
Amy Young, Michelle Fleet, Francisco Graziano and Heather McGinley (a newcomer, strikingly redheaded and gifted) complete the cast. I particularly welcome the fullness of tone in their footwork. Mr. Taylor's style has always had a few ballet qualities, but his dancers have always leavened that with a rich weightedness that almost no ballet dancer can approach. Tuesday's performance showed me how much of that sense of weight occurs in the foot, using the floor with such lusciousness.
No less excellent, and yet more abundant, is ''Brandenburgs,'' a 1988 work set to movements from Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, again here featuring Mr. Trusnovec at its compelling center, with brilliant solo roles for Ms. Young, Eran Bugge, Laura Halzack and an extraordinarily vivid chorus of five men.
The 2006 comedy ''Troilus and Cressida (reduced)'' has individual pratfalls that make me laugh out loud even though I lose patience with it over all; still, I adore the originality of the mind that conceives a cartoon-farce version of the Troilus-Cressida story (with three Cupids and three Greek invaders) and then fits it to the adorable corn of Ponchielli's ''Dance of the Hours.''
The audience loved, perhaps most of all, the closing work, ''Piazzolla Caldera'' (1997), with its men and women meeting like rival armies for the sexually charged world of the tango. I find the steaminess and yearning all too obvious, but never mind. This is a piece in which you can dissent while still acknowledging the skill of Mr. Taylor's stagecraft and the panache of his dancers. Eighteen other works join the repertory of the season that lies ahead; I look forward to them all.

HEADLINE: A Groupon Alternative Aims to Offer Small Businesses a Better Deal

BYLINE: By DAVID H. FREEDMAN

 BODY:
Constant Contact has been one of the big success stories when it comes to online companies that specialize in serving small businesses. Some half a million of them count on the company's Web-based help in building, managing and creating marketing campaigns around customer e-mail lists.
Started 14 years ago, the company, which is based in Waltham, Mass., went public in 2007 and has expanded into other areas, including managing social-network marketing campaigns. In February, it introduced yet another service: coupon-based deal marketing. That brings Constant Contact into a crowded field of competition along with Groupon and LivingSocial. In a recent interview, condensed below, Gail F. Goodman, Constant Contact's chief executive, explained why she thinks small businesses will prefer her company's service.
Q.A lot of consumers are already burned out on deals. Are you too late? 
A. We think of SaveLocal as building on the consumer experience that the daily deal companies have demonstrated. Their model has been about large-scale consumer lists, but we saw a while ago that it wasn't perfectly serving our customer base of small businesses, 70 percent of which have fewer than 10 employees. We started talking to our customers about what did and didn't work for them with Groupon and LivingSocial. We knew there had to be a better way, but it took us until the beginning of last summer to come up with what we thought would be a twist on the model that would make coupons work.
Then we spent six months developing and testing it to make sure we had it right. We think the timing is actually pretty good, because the merchant community has had a chance to become aware of the issues and problems with the daily deal market, and they've become very open-minded to the idea of structuring deals in a different way.
Q.What's different about your model?
A. If Groupon provides quantity, we want to provide quality. We think the way to find your next great customer is through your existing customers, rather than through a big list of consumers who don't know much about you. SaveLocal is about sending coupons to your current customer base, and providing them with an incentive to share the coupons with their social network in order to bring in new customers. We also turn the economics of the deal on its head, by letting the merchant control the amount of the discount so they're not losing money on it.
Q.What's the incentive for a small business's customers to share a deal with their social network?
A. The small business chooses the incentive. The reward might be an extra $5 discount on the coupon, or 20 percent off on a second visit, or a free item, or whatever the business wants to offer. But the biggest difference with SaveLocal is that the customer gets the reward just for sharing, whether or not the friends buy anything.
Q.By offering smaller discounts, your merchants may protect per-customer profits, but won't the deals be less compelling to consumers?
A. We're seeing success with discounts of less than half off. We haven't tested it enough to know exactly at what point you get diminishing returns from decreasing the discount, but we've seen a customer be wildly successful with a 33 percent discount. A smaller discount might not attract as many customers, but it's the rabid deal-seekers who are going to find it less appealing, and that's not necessarily who small businesses want to attract.
We're changing the whole economics of the deal. The daily deal companies not only make merchants offer about half off, they keep about half of what the merchant takes in on the deal. We only charge $1 to $3 for each coupon. And we help our customers think through the best way to structure the deal. Restaurants can offer a coupon for less than the average ticket and make more when the customer buys up, so that if customers spend $40 on a dinner, the merchant can offer a $20 coupon for $10, and keep all of the extra $20 that the customer spends.
Q.If your customers e-mail their offerings only to existing customers, are they giving up the opportunity to attract lots of new customers?
A. About a fifth of the people responding to our deals are new customers for the merchant. But more important, because they're getting the offer through an existing customer, they're much more likely to be local than the people who respond to daily deals, and they're much more likely to turn into loyal customers. They're learning about the deal from an existing customer who's endorsing the merchant. And we give merchants the means for following up, by helping the merchant get the new customer's e-mail address and opt-in permission during the purchase process. Groupon and LivingSocial don't share contact information with merchants.
Q.Why can't a small business send out its own coupons to its own mailing list? Why does it need you?
A. We make it easier and help them structure and manage the deal. We handle the redemption, and we gather and analyze the data, so the merchant can understand the true R.O.I. of the deal based on how much customers spent and how much of it was discounted. And we make it ridiculously affordable.
Q.How do you calculate the return on investment?
A. We think about R.O.I. in two stages. First, the small business wants to know if it made money just on the purchases made by both existing and new customers when they use the coupons, and we track all that to tell our customers exactly how much was spent on the total purchase versus what the business spent on the promotion.
Then we look at the longer-term R.O.I. by tracking how many new customers were brought in and whether they're being turned into loyal repeat customers by collecting their e-mail addresses with permission for the small business to contact them. We'll continue to track that longer-term R.O.I. and help our customers take advantage of it with e-mail campaigns.
From the deals that have been done with SaveLocal so far, we've seen a good R.O.I. just on the first stage, and now we're starting to see it on the second stage.
[You can read about a business that tried SaveLocal and one that chose not to at nytimes.com/boss.]
Q.Not all businesses have their customers' e-mails. Can this work for a business that hasn't been collecting e-mails?
A. Certainly it wouldn't be starting from as strong a point as a business that has the e-mail addresses, but yes, a small business can start off SaveLocal through sharing over a social network. We believe it's important that every small business build that e-mail list, and these offers create a great incentive for customers to get on it.
Q.How is your core business of e-mail-based marketing holding up? Is it being replaced by social-media marketing?
A. We do help customers with social-network campaigns, but e-mail is still one of the fundamental channels of communication. Facebook just released the statistic that on average only 12 percent of the people that ''like'' a page see a new message from the page owner show up in their news feed. The typical small business only has about 100 people who like their page, which means a total of 12 people are seeing the message. The typical small business has more than 2,000 names on an e-mail list. It wouldn't be smart to stop communicating to those 2,000 people in order to focus on the 100 people they might be able to reach on Facebook.

HEADLINE: For Museum Of Negro Leagues, A Big Opportunity

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
KAUFFMAN STADIUM, home of the Kansas City Royals, will become the hub of Major League Baseball in July when it hosts the All-Star Game for the first time since 1973, the year it opened. And Bob Kendrick is hoping the attendant swirl of publicity will extend to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum, about seven miles away at the fabled intersection of 18th and Vine Streets.
Mr. Kendrick, the museum's president and executive director, is assembling a special exhibition at the museum this summer to draw some of the game's expected crush of out-of-town visitors. 
The museum exhibition will highlight the careers of several Negro Leagues players -- Hank Aaron and Willie Mays among them -- who went on to become big-league all-stars during Major League Baseball's period of gradual racial integration between 1947 and 1959. (''What we've found is that they made a tremendous impact on the game right away,'' Mr. Kendrick said.)
With the museum struggling in recent years to draw 50,000 visitors annually, Mr. Kendrick is hoping the game raises the museum's profile and results in an enduring rise in attendance from visitors and area residents alike. The American Jazz Museum, in the same building, is also looking for an attendance surge, as is the surrounding 18th and Vine district, which years ago was the rollicking home of Kansas City jazz and more recently has worked its way back from decline.
According to Mr. Kendrick and Greg Carroll, the executive director of the jazz museum, about 300,000 visitors annually come to one or both of the museums, the Blue Room jazz club next door and to events at the majestic old Gem Theater across the street. Attendance has not decreased, Mr. Kendrick said, but ''the growth hasn't happened as fast as we'd like.''
The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was founded by a group of former players that included John ''Buck'' O'Neil, who played for and managed the Kansas City Monarchs, a perennial power in the Negro American League. When Mr. O'Neil was prominently featured in the 1994 Ken Burns documentary ''Baseball,'' the museum basked in national attention. But after Mr. O'Neil died in 2006 at the age of 94, it began to lose visitors and money.
Mr. Kendrick, who had been the museum's marketing director, left for another job, but returned last April as president and executive director, with the aim of reviving its fortunes.
One challenge facing the museum is not being near popular tourist destinations like Country Club Plaza and the Crown Center area south of downtown. There has been a lingering perception that the 18th and Vine neighborhood, though significantly different from the tattered area it was 30 years ago, is still unsafe. Over the years, some have proposed moving the museum to the area that includes Kauffman Stadium and Arrowhead Stadium, the Kansas City Chiefs' home, or folding it into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
But Mr. Kendrick sees potential for the current location in an untapped audience: ''The economy has made people want to stay a little closer to home,'' he said.
And Mr. Carroll commented, ''We're amazed at the number of people who visit the space for the first time and live maybe four or five miles away.''
With both museums under the same roof, an old-fashioned doubleheader of sorts can be enjoyed. Admission to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum is $8, $3 for children; a ticket to the baseball and jazz museums is $10 for adults, $5 for children.
That might appeal to at least some of the 120,000 to 150,000 people expected to attend at least one All-Star Game-related event, according to the Kansas City Convention and Visitors Association (there are also celebrity games and a Home Run Derby on the schedule). It is hoped the visitors will help to generate as much as $50 million in local business over the three days of baseball's midseason break.
Such numbers could help push the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum into a new era, Mr. Kendrick said.
That view is shared by Joe Posnanski, a former sports columnist for The Kansas City Star who now writes for Sports Illustrated. ''I know Bob is working on getting current players involved, getting media members involved, getting all-time greats involved,'' Mr. Posnanski said of the museum director. ''He has a lot of great ideas. And he has boundless energy and optimism. I have a lot of hope.''

HEADLINE: Lured by Visions of Real Estate Profits, Nonprofit Group Stumbled

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
PATERSON, N.J. -- At the height of the housing boom, a luxury development arose here that was carved out of a 19th-century brick-and-brownstone factory building, with 14-foot ceilings, oversize windows and granite countertops.
Like many similar condominium projects, this one collapsed with the recession. But the damage rippled far beyond this historic city because of the project's main financial backer: one of the most illustrious nonprofit housing groups in the nation.
The group, the Community Preservation Corporation, which for decades has played a pivotal role in reviving downtrodden neighborhoods across New York City, has teetered at the brink of collapse in recent months after it strayed far from its traditional mission.
Community Preservation, established in 1974 at the initiative of the banker David Rockefeller, had long used capital that it raised from scores of commercial banks to finance the creation or rehabilitation of rent-regulated, multifamily apartments for the poor and working class. But during the boom, it was instead pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into condo projects and a large-scale development. 
It did so, in part, through an unusual for-profit arm.
The group's problems suggest how the siren song of the explosive real estate market in the middle of the last decade seemed to warp the priorities of even stalwart nonprofit housing providers. ''C.P.C. was tempted into more speculative lending, which harmed the organization financially and left a big hole in the field of lending for multifamily housing,'' said Brad Lander, a Brooklyn Democrat and housing expert who is on the City Council. ''Two-thirds of the city's housing stock are rental units, and that's why we need C.P.C. to return to its core mission.''
The investments were spearheaded by Community Preservation's longtime leader, Michael D. Lappin, whose salary and bonuses rose to $1.1 million as he pushed the group into riskier ventures. Some were financed by Community Preservation, others by its for-profit spinoff, which paid part of Mr. Lappin's salary.
At the time, Community Preservation defended the ventures, saying it needed to invest in condominiums and other relatively upscale developments in order to strengthen neighborhoods by creating mixed-income communities. But others pointed out that even if that had been the case, the group should not have allocated so much of its capital to such projects.
At the peak of the real estate boom in 2007 and 2008, more than half of the $1.5 billion in loans originated by Community Preservation or its for-profit arm were for condos.
Mr. Lappin established the for-profit arm in the 1990s to allow Community Preservation to invest directly in projects, rather than just lend money for them. The profits were supposed to be directed back into the pool of money that the group lent. But during the housing boom, the for-profit arm, C.P.C. Resources, took on an increasingly important role in Community Preservation's affairs.
In 2004, C.P.C. Resources bought an 11-acre parcel on the Brooklyn waterfront where a Domino sugar refinery once stood. The $1.4 billion project was supposed to convert the refinery into 2,200 apartments, a mix of luxury and subsidized units. But it repeatedly ran into delays before obtaining government approval in 2010. Last month, C.P.C. Resources defaulted on its $125 million New Domino loan.
Community Preservation also provided a $23 million loan for a luxury condo project called Metroplex on the waterfront in Rockaway, Queens. The 126 apartments had balconies with ocean views, oak floors, Jacuzzis and a gym, but when the project opened, not a single one sold.
Some of the projects had government subsidies that made them affordable to families earning $90,000 to $140,000 a year. But while there is a constant demand for affordable rental housing in the New York region, the market for even subsidized condos, which can take three years to develop, died with the recession.
Late last year, with more than $150 million in loans in default and Community Preservation in crisis, its board and the commercial banks that support it forced Mr. Lappin, 68, into retirement.
Nearly two-thirds of the condo loans were delinquent, according to the nonprofit group's records.
Community Preservation also closed offices in New Jersey and Connecticut, cut salaries for senior executives by 45 percent and dismissed 40 percent of its staff.
In January, the group just barely averted shutting down by working out an extension of its troubled revolving loan program with 72 lenders, including Deutsche Bank and Chase.
In an interview, Mr. Lappin stood by his decision to shift the group's focus during the housing boom, saying the group needed to consider the needs of middle-class people in order to ensure that neighborhoods were stable. ''In the end, I couldn't be prouder of what's been done,'' he said. ''Everybody makes mistakes over a long career.''
Community Preservation's board has hired a new chief executive, Rafael E. Cestero, a former New York housing commissioner, hoping to refocus the organization on rental housing in New York, albeit as a far more modest financier than it was in 2007.
Mr. Lappin had been the guiding force behind Community Preservation for more than 30 years, and was known as a zealous advocate for affordable housing. He created a one-stop shop, providing loans to landlords and nonprofit housing groups, assisting them in obtaining government grants and tax credits, and ensuring that building owners replaced boilers, installed new elevators and fixed leaky roofs.
All told, the group financed 147,000 new or rehabilitated apartments in working-class neighborhoods from Washington Heights in Manhattan to Crown Heights in Brooklyn.
Mr. Lappin's supporters suggested that he was being scapegoated for a brutal economic downturn that buffeted homeowners, lenders, developers and nonprofit housing groups alike.
Community Preservation's difficulties and its push into the condo market should not have been a surprise to its board, which is composed of current and former bankers, the supporters said.
Executives from many of the lending banks sat on its loan committees. And many of the same lenders who urged Mr. Lappin's ouster had a worse record of bad loans to private developers.
''Why did this organization get into the cross hairs of the banks when those very banks had much worse problems in their own rights, is a mystery to us,'' said Michael Gecan, a senior organizer with Metro Industrial Areas Foundation and East Brooklyn Congregations, which has long worked with Community Preservation.
D. Kenneth Patton, a former real estate executive and Community Preservation board member, acknowledged the board's role. ''I was a member of the board who encouraged them to go into riskier places,'' Mr. Patton said. ''I was wrong. There was a much higher default rate. New Jersey was the worst.''
In any event, no one in the housing world wants to see Community Preservation disappear.
City officials and others have pleaded with bank officials who contribute to its loan pool to allow Community Preservation to refocus on affordable rental housing. The officials said they were worried that if Community Preservation was hobbled or closed, buildings in many poor neighborhoods would suffer.
The group's champions said the hiring of Mr. Cestero, the former housing commissioner, would help to restore confidence in Community Preservation.
Still, the group is on a tight leash. Working with state and city officials, Community Preservation recently resumed lending, putting $2.8 million into four buildings in the Morrisania section of the Bronx.
''We're not looking backward,'' Mr. Cestero said. ''We're moving forward. The affordable housing community has spoken loudly that it needs C.P.C. focused on its core mission.''

HEADLINE: Art Museums Giving It the Old College Try

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
EAST LANSING, Mich.
WHEN it opens this fall, the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum at Michigan State University will be the latest in a series of new university art museums that have opened around the country.
But here and at other campuses, striking buildings are just a part of the new profile of university art museums. With the help of departments as varied as nursing, law, meteorology and engineering, the museums' directors are deploying their extensive collections, and sometimes the artists themselves, to enhance curriculums.
In one project under development at the Broad, Amy Franceschini, an artist and urban garden advocate from San Francisco, would serve as an artist-in-residence working with students and faculty in the university's sustainable agriculture program to develop a local foods program in Detroit. Ms. Franceschini attracted attention by using visual design references and received financing for San Francisco community gardens. She also designed a pogo stick that also served as a shovel and a bicycle that converted into a wheelbarrow.
In another planned project, Tim Hyde, a photographer and video artist from New York, would work with Michigan State's forestry and natural resources students and faculty, drawing on his 10 years of photographing the deadfall and shadowed canopy of an 80-year-old red pine plantation in western Michigan. 
''The students in M.S.U.'s programs in sustainable forests would have the opportunity to see their world through the eyes of an artist who brings a sensitivity and new vision to something they study every day,'' Michael Rush, the Broad Museum's director, said in describing his interest in Mr. Hyde's work. ''He would open their eyes to an entirely new perception of what a forest is and can be.''
University art museums, of course, have been a mainstay of American campuses since 1832, when the Yale University Art Gallery was established, the first university museum devoted exclusively to art, according to a paper by Kimerly Rorschach, the director of the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke.
Harvard, Oberlin, the University of Oregon, the University of Michigan, the University of North Carolina and dozens of other colleges and universities have built art museums, too, according to Ms. Rorschach, and more are being built. For example, DePaul University opened its Art Museum in Chicago in September 2011. The Art Museum of West Virginia University is scheduled to open next year.
All have attracted extensive collections and operated under the general mandate, Ms. Rorschach writes, ''to give students an opportunity to develop into more cultivated, well-rounded and well-educated adults through contact with original works of art.''
In the 21st century, university art museums have become more aggressive in extending their missions and collections to reach deeper into classrooms and curriculums not ordinarily associated with art. At Duke's seven-year-old Nasher Museum, two members of its 30-person staff are devoted exclusively to finding uses for pieces from the collection to enhance course work in various academic departments. Medical students, for instance, spend a day studying visual art in an exercise intended to hone observation and description skills that Nasher staff member developed with professors.
A Duke professor of geology uses the museum's collection of art carved from stone for lessons on the influence of time, oceans and weather.
In both instances, Nasher's academic coordinators helped their colleagues in medicine and geology use art to interest students heavily influenced by the visual immediacy of the Internet, and to be aware that their careers were likely to include colleagues and alliances outside the United States.
''Students need to learn things and to be innovative and entrepreneurial in this new global world,'' said Ms. Rorschach. ''Art is about communicating effectively, about communicating visually, about understanding.''
At the University of North Carolina, Mimi V. Chapman, an associate professor of social work, worked with the academic coordinators at the university's Ackland Art Museum to train graduate students to more carefully evaluate how their impressions were formed in working with clients. ''Art is a way that helps uncover how students see things through a personal lens, and become aware of biases they may not be aware they have,'' she said.
This semester, Professor Chapman and eight graduate students spent a day in January and another in February studying an assortment of 20th century portraits and landscapes, among them Milton Avery's ''Landscape,'' painted in 1948. The dominant images in Avery's impressionistic scene are a blue hammock swinging from two dark tree trunks along a pathway flanked by blue and gold trees. Professor Chapman assigned students to describe what they saw in the picture -- its images, colors, and emotions -- and where they would hang it in their own homes.
Alison Doernberg, a 34-year-old student, was surprised by the range of responses to Avery's painting. ''Even though it was a simple image, people had very different perceptions,'' said Ms. Doernberg. ''Some of us felt the trees were dark and foreboding. Other people saw them as solid and providing shade. Their view was more positive. It seemed to me, at first glance, to be an image that wasn't particularly provocative. But it turned out to be a lot to discuss.
''The lesson is that it's not just what I am seeing in a piece of art or a client,'' she said. ''It's also thinking about why I am perceiving things the way I do. Are they coming from things in front of me or from other sources in my life? It feels very transferable to me.''
In October, the University of Wisconsin opened a $47.2 million, 81,000-square-foot addition to the Chazen Museum of Art in Madison. The museum's academic outreach program includes a project with Steven A. Ackerman, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences, who teaches an introductory course on weather.
Among the Chazen's collection of landscapes, Professor Ackerman chose to focus on ''Our Good Earth,'' painted by the American regionalist John Steuart Curry in 1942. Visiting the museum last fall with a group of students studying atmospheric optics and cloud formations, he drew their attention not to the central features of Curry's painting -- a young, muscular overall-clad farmer standing watch as two children play in maturing wheat -- but to the range of blues in Curry's sky and the shape and shading in Curry's puffy clouds.
''We are particularly interested in how the artist represents clouds,'' he said. ''Today's scientists deal with tons and tons of data. How do we represent the huge volume of data we receive? How do we visualize that data? How artists visualize the world is very valuable to us.''
In East Lansing, Lou Anna K. Simon, the president of Michigan State, said novel academic programs would be part of the university's plan to establish the Broad as a ''museum without walls.''
''It is a focal point of this campus,'' said Ms. Simon. ''Students from any department, any part of this campus, will find some place for themselves at the museum.''
Alison Gass, a new curator at the Broad, was busy recently scouting empty spaces on and off Michigan State's campus to house an art and garden project. Ms. Gass came to Michigan from San Francisco, where she worked at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, became aware of Ms. Franceschini's work and included several pieces of Ms. Franceschini's art in an exhibition at the museum.
''I called Amy when I got here and I told her this place was fantastic,'' said Ms. Gass. ''There is land here. They study food systems and forests and have experimental farms. There is real potential to be a leader in land art.''
Ms. Franceschini said she was interested in the Michigan State opportunity. ''Local food and gardens are critical agents of change,'' she said. ''The process of making that happen is as much part of the creative process as traditional art. The idea of applying art to knowledge production and the knowledge economy there is very attractive.''

HEADLINE: Questions As Banks Increase Dividends

BYLINE: By J. B. SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
Emboldened by the Federal Reserve's passing grades on stress tests of banks, some of the nation's biggest financial firms are racing to dole out billions of dollars in dividends.
But some industry analysts and academics say that it is too soon and that it could threaten to put banks on shaky ground.
Such moves deplete the capital cushions of banks, potentially making them far more vulnerable to withstanding sudden market shocks. 
''It's frankly irresponsible to allow banks to quickly empty their coffers,'' said Neil Barofsky, the former inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. ''They should be holding onto this money.''
Another potential problem is that stress tests might overstate the health of banks, Mr. Barofsky said.
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve concluded that 15 of the 19 banks it examined would be able to maintain a minimum capital level during a severe economic crisis. That cleared the way for those banks to bolster dividend payments to shareholders and initiate a round of share buybacks.
It also set off a debate among economists and banking analysts about whether banks have actually achieved renewed strength.
''The Fed has essentially appeased critics and proclaimed the banks healthy without doing real due diligence,'' said Anat R. Admati, a professor of finance and economics at Stanford.
The Fed has maintained that its examination of banks was extremely rigorous. On Tuesday, a senior Federal Reserve official countered any worries about the health of most banks, noting that despite dividend plans, the banks would all have more capital by the end of the year than they had at the start of the year. That is because banks, even after increasing shareholder payouts this year, will still retain more profits because the dividends will be lower than they were before the financial crisis. Despite paying out dividends last year, they bolstered their capital by $52 billion in 2011.
Healthy banks should be able to reward their shareholders with dividend payments, some banking analysts said.
''The scenarios were incredibly severe, and the banks fared extremely well,'' said Michael Scanlon, a senior equity analyst with Manulife Asset Management in Boston.
First out of the gate, JPMorgan Chase announced Tuesday that it would buy back roughly $12 billion in stock this year and increase its quarterly dividend payment by a nickel, to 30 cents.
Others quickly followed suit, bolstered by passing the Fed's test. Wells Fargo increased its dividend by 10 cents, to 22 cents. John Stumpf, the bank's chairman and chief executive said, ''We are extremely pleased to reward our shareholders.''
American Express, the credit card issuer, also announced it would increase its quarterly dividend by 2 cents, to 20 cents a share. Meanwhile, U.S. Bancorp raised its quarterly dividend, too, by 7 cents, to 19.5 cents.
The latest tests were the third that banks have been subjected to in the wake of the financial crisis. While some complained that the tests were too harsh, forcing industry titans like Citigroup to shelve plans for a dividend payment, some economists, including Professor Admati, have raised an alarm, saying the tests were not hard enough.
''Why are we letting banks hand out dividend payments and encouraging risky behavior after they passed flimsy tests?'' she said. ''It's frankly dangerous, and the Fed should not allow it.''
Rebel A. Cole, a former Fed economist and a professor of finance at DePaul University, said that the stress tests created too rosy a picture, drastically understating how a financial crisis would impact banks' balance sheets.
Even though the tests assumed a grim economic situation, with unemployment surging to 13 percent and housing prices plummeting by 21 percent, they failed to register how deeply banks' holdings, like mortgages and credit cards, would suffer.
For instance, the tests assumed that banks could lose up to $56 billion on home equity lines of credit and second-lien mortgages, or roughly 13 percent of their portfolio. That's too low, Mr. Cole said. ''Those loss rates don't even pass the smell test,'' he said. In an economic downturn, more underwater homeowners would default on their loans, he said.
Another problem with the tests, critics said, was that they underestimated the legal liabilities that might still be lurking for banks as they work through a backlog of soured mortgages.
In its analysis of Bank of America, the Fed predicted the firm could withstand up to $60 billion in losses over the next two years, without increasing its current dividend of 1 cent a quarter. But Professor Cole said that Bank of America's liabilities on those mortgages -- especially if the bank has to pay more money to investors who are demanding that the bank reimburse them for losses on mortgage bonds -- could far exceed that $60 billion mark.
In addition, the Fed too heavily relies on 2008 and 2009 to create its nightmare economic situations, he said. For example, the Fed situation expected that interest rates on 10-year Treasuries would plunge to 1.64 percent, without factoring in a different circumstance where interest rates could surge and undercut loan demand.
In addition, the tests did not take into account difficulties that the banks might face in borrowing money. Without that, the tests could potentially be incomplete, Mr. Barofsky said.
Instead of allowing banks to return money to shareholders, the Fed should force them to retain it, he said. ''In this case, the Fed is acting as enabler,'' he said.
Banks had long been a reliable source of income for shareholders through dividends, until the rising payouts were essentially wiped out as the financial crisis crippled the banks and they sought federal money to survive. Shareholders have been pressuring banks to increase the payouts, eager to recoup losses on financial stocks.
Citigroup was among those that were not permitted to raise dividends. It had paid a hefty 54 cent quarterly dividend to shareholders before the financial crisis. Now, the bank pays 1 cent a share. The Fed quashed Citi's latest effort to increase dividend payouts for shareholders. The regulator determined that despite two years of profits, Citi would not have enough capital to increase its dividend payments while still weathering a financial crisis even more severe than 2008's. Neither Citi nor the Fed disclosed how much the bank wanted to raise the payout.
Still, Citi will try again, resubmitting a revised proposal to the central bank later this year.

HEADLINE: Senate Passes 2-Year Transportation Bill

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate easily approved a two-year, $109 billion transportation and infrastructure bill on Wednesday, putting pressure on House Republicans to set aside their stalled version and pass the Senate's before the federal highway trust fund expires at the end of the month.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, extolled the measure, passed on a bipartisan vote of 74 to 22, as ''a jobs bill in the true sense of the word.'' 
''I hope the House will take this up and not listen to this shrill voice that makes up so much of the Republican caucus in the House,'' he said.
But the nearly three million jobs expected to be ''saved or created'' by the measure largely come from construction jobs that stand to be lost if federally financed projects grind to a halt on April 1, when money from the highway trust fund could no longer be used.
That deadline appears to be weighing heavily on House Republicans, who initially had wanted to use their measure to change federal transportation policy fundamentally by linking infrastructure spending to the expansion of oil drilling from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to the outer continental shelf off the East Coast.
The five-year House proposal was stymied by a coalition of opponents in both parties, and Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, one of its initial backers, has all but abandoned it.
''As the speaker said, the plan as it stands right now is to let the Senate pass a bill and take up something that looks like it,'' said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, ''unless the House coalesces around a better alternative, which we are actively pursuing.''
The Senate bill, written by one of the chamber's most liberal Democrats, Senator Barbara Boxer of California, and one of its most conservative Republicans, Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, consolidates 196 federal transportation programs to about a dozen, while giving more flexibility to the states to decide transportation priorities. But it largely keeps the scope of federal highway, transit and other surface transportation projects intact. Senators kept the duration of the bill short, to two years, because of the difficulty in paying for its programs as gasoline tax revenues slide.
President Obama, as well as highway and transit advocates, had pressed for a big, upfront increase in infrastructure spending to lift the economy and address the nation's aging roads and bridges. But considering that House Republicans last year were considering a 35 percent cut to transportation spending, level funding may have been the best that advocates could hope for, said Rob Healy, vice president for government affairs at the American Public Transportation Association.
Rather than raising the gas tax, as many transportation advocates suggest, the Senate jury-rigged the bill with an array of revenue provisions, tapping a trust fund established to clean up leaking underground storage tanks and adjusting the way pension fund contributions and liabilities are calculated.
Taxpayers for Common Sense, a watchdog group, criticized the use of 10 years of revenue from such provisions to pay for a two-year transportation bill.
''That's kind of how Congress is approaching every problem,'' cobbling together short-term fixes without addressing long-term problems, said Jeff Shoaf, head of Congressional relations for the Associated General Contractors of America, which nonetheless strongly supported the bill.
Mr. Shoaf said the legislation would spur hiring in the construction industry, where unemployment hit 17.1 percent in February. With infrastructure spending stable for two years, construction firms should begin buying equipment and hiring permanent workers, he said.
''It's not as long as we would like, but in aggregate the fact that we're talking about a transportation bill at all is positive,'' said Sean McNally, spokesman for the American Trucking Associations.

HEADLINE: Upstart Leader in China Is Ousted From Party Post

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Bo Xilai, the brash Communist Party chief of the Chongqing municipality in China's southwest, has been removed from his post, an unmistakable sign that recent scandals in that city have put an end to his political ambitions and complicated the national leadership transition that will take place in the fall.
The news, announced Thursday morning in a brief dispatch by the official Xinhua news service, said Vice Prime Minister Zhang Dejiang would replace him as party secretary of Chongqing. 
Until recently, Mr. Bo had been a prime contender for the all-powerful Standing Committee of the Politburo, a nine-member body that effectively runs the country. Seven of the members are to be replaced, and Mr. Bo's demotion suggests there will be more drama in a usually secret process.
Mr. Bo's troubles began last month when his handpicked police chief, Wang Lijun, sought refuge in the United States Consulate in Chengdu, about 210 miles from Chongqing. Mr. Wang, who had come under scrutiny in a corruption inquiry, spent the night in the consulate before being escorted to Beijing by security officials. He was also removed from his post, according to state media.
The drama that spread from Chongqing to Beijing in recent weeks has riveted the nation and emboldened Mr. Bo's many critics, who assailed a populist governing style that included an out-of-control assault on criminals and political enemies alike. Tall, charismatic and unusually loquacious for a Chinese official, Mr. Bo, 63, had led a ''red'' campaign in the teeming mountain city that called on its citizens to sing Mao-era songs. While popular among the city's 32 million residents, Mr. Bo's style unnerved many who said his tactics threatened to revive the destructive leftist ways of the past.
With Mr. Bo running political interference, Mr. Wang took on the city's gangs, arresting 2,000 people, including high-level Communist Party officials charged with shielding crime lords. The campaign also skirted normal judicial procedures, and 13 people were executed after speedy trials.
One Beijing analyst with senior-level connections said he had heard that Mr. Bo would be investigated and charged with violations relating to Mr. Wang's case and to evidence Mr. Wang had provided against him. But it was unclear how the case against Mr. Bo would be pursued, and the analyst said it could take months.
''For now, Bo Xilai has been hung on the rack,'' the analyst said. ''He has no power and no position.''
That assessment could not be immediately confirmed, and without any word on a new assignment it was possible Mr. Bo could still have a political career.
Some postings on Sina Weibo, China's popular microblog service, mocked Mr. Bo, but others were supportive of his efforts to spur economic growth, improve the lives of farmers and lessen the income gap in Chongqing.
''He gave rural residents the same health insurance that only urban residents had,'' read one posting. ''I will miss him.''
Online Correction: March 15, 2012, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A digital headline on an earlier version of this article incorrectly described the actions taken against Bo Xilai. Mr. Bo lost his post as party secretary of Chongqing, as correctly described in the article and in its primary headline; he was not ousted from China's Communist Party.

HEADLINE: Jobs Bill Stalls as Congress Fights Over Agency

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A fight over a small export credit agency is dividing Congress and holding up a popular bipartisan jobs bill.
The Export-Import Bank -- a self-financing agency that helps to facilitate the sale of American goods overseas -- needs Congressional reauthorization by the end of May. It is also close to hitting its $100 billion lending cap, hobbling its ability to offer new loans, and has asked Congress to raise its financing limit.
With those two issues at hand, Congress is arguing over the bank's future, with some Republicans floating a proposal that might end up abolishing the bank, and Senate Democrats hoping to force its expansion and reauthorization by attaching it to jobs legislation. 
On Wednesday, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, introduced an amendment to keep the bank running through 2015 and to increase its loan limit to $140 billion. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, is cosponsoring the amendment. The Senate is tying the amendment to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS Act, a bill containing a bevy of measures to aid small businesses. The JOBS Act passed the House last week with broad bipartisan support and has won plaudits from the White House.
''Allowing the Ex-Im Bank to expire would be a crippling blow to our export economy,'' Ms. Cantwell said Wednesday. ''Extending the Ex-Im bank will provide certainty for American businesses and help support more private sector job growth.''
But some House Republicans are resisting, arguing the Senate should pass the JOBS Act as it is, and that Congress should then turn to reauthorizing -- and reforming -- the small financing institution.
The stand-off has left members of the two chambers trading barbs, and has divided Republicans, many of whom support the bank's reauthorization. Senate leadership is ''choosing to needlessly delay the JOBS bill by adding unrelated provisions,'' said Laena E. Fallon, a spokeswoman for Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader.
''This is absolutely a jobs measure,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, speaking alongside Ms. Cantwell. ''Once again, the Tea Party faction over in the House is trying to manufacture a controversy. Once again they want to stand in the way of something that will help boost the economy.''
Some Republicans have denounced the Export-Import Bank as ''corporate welfare'' and argue that the government should not be doing the market's job of providing deal financing. They also argue that while Export-Import Bank financing provides a competitive advantage to some American businesses, it effectively disadvantages others.
Republican senators have also raised questions about whether the bank operates with sufficient oversight. ''Ex-Im is processing more than 90 percent of its loan and guarantee applications without conducting a Congressionally required review of any serious adverse effects of the loan,'' a group of six senators, including Jim DeMint of South Carolina, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, wrote in February in a letter.
Mr. Cantor has floated draft legislation that would increase the bank's loan limit to $113 billion and extend its authority to keep lending until June 2013. But the proposal would also require President Obama to ''initiate and pursue negotiations'' with other major exporting countries to ''end subsidized export financing programs and other forms of export subsidies.'' Such negotiations might lead to the institution being closed.
Officials at the Export-Import Bank argue that the bank levels the playing field for American manufacturers against their foreign competitors. They also said that the bank conducts thorough reviews to ensure that it does not harm any domestic businesses.
''We want to make sure that American exporters have the same backing as foreign companies do,'' said Fred P. Hochberg, the Export-Import Bank's president, in an interview in his office overlooking the White House. ''Congress is talking about unilateral disarmament.''
Indeed, virtually all other developed countries, and most major exporters in the emerging markets, have export credit agencies like the Export-Import Bank. They generally approve a far wider range of loans and are bigger in proportion to their countries' total exports, said Gary Clyde Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based research institution.
''Ex-Im mostly finances long-term capital goods sales to developing countries, like selling turbines or airplanes to Asia,'' Mr. Hufbauer said. ''There just isn't a lot of private sector financing for those projects.''
The Export-Import Bank provides most of its loans to small businesses. But the bulk of its financing in dollar terms goes to major manufacturers, particularly in the airline industry. In the 2011 fiscal year, it provided financing worth $33 billion, supporting $41 billion in exports, it said.
The bank's role in the airline industry forms the backdrop to the Congressional dispute, and has led to a flurry of behind-the-scenes lobbying.
For instance, the head of Boeing, a recipient of Export-Import Bank financing, visited Mr. Cantor on the Hill last week to push for the bank's quick reauthorization. W. James McNerney Jr., Boeing's chief executive, argued that uncertainty over Washington's commitment to export financing was already hurting business, people familiar with the discussion said.
But Delta has argued that the bank's financing, facilitating the sale of Boeing aircraft to competitor airlines, would harm its business. The airline has lobbied on the other side.
Democratic Senate aides said they expected Ms. Cantwell's amendment to pass the Senate, where a few Republican members have expressed support for reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. That leaves it up to the House to either agree to the Senate's version of the bill, or to see the JOBS act stall before it can reach the president's desk.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Praises Community Banks

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Community banks are gaining strength even though the American economy is improving only moderately, the Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said Wednesday. 
The Fed chief delivered recorded remarks on a video monitor before a convention of community bankers in Nashville. The speech was similar to one he gave last month in Arlington, Va.
Mr. Bernanke said community bank profits were higher in 2011 than the previous year and bad loans were decreasing. He also said they had built up cushions against loan losses. Community banks have assets below $10 billion. Mr. Bernanke did not mention the Fed's interest rate policies in his taped speech. During the February speech, Mr. Bernanke defended the Fed's decisions to keep interest rates at record-low levels.
On Tuesday, the Fed repeated its plan to keep short-term interest rates near zero through 2014.
In Wednesday's speech, Mr. Bernanke sought to counter criticism that the overhaul of financial regulations that Congress passed in 2010 was imposing unnecessary burdens on banks.
''We take quite seriously the importance of evaluating the costs and benefits of new rules,'' Mr. Bernanke said in his remarks to the national convention of the Independent Community Bankers of America.
Mr. Bernanke said that most of the provisions in the 2010 law were aimed at addressing the threats posed to the financial system from the largest financial institutions and not at community banks.
''We will work to maintain a clear distinction between community banks and larger institutions in the application of new regulations,'' Mr. Bernanke said.

HEADLINE: Iran's President Unfazed In Parliamentary Grilling

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE and ALAN COWELL; Rick Gladstone reported from New York, and Alan Cowell from London. J. David Goodman contributed reporting from New York, and Artin Afkhami from Boston.

 BODY:
Lawmakers in Iran subjected the president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to an unprecedented interrogation on Wednesday, questioning his economic policies, cabinet appointments and tense relationship with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a publicly broadcast parliamentary session that seemed intended to humiliate the president in the final few years of his tenure.
The hourlong interrogation, carried live on Iran state radio, was the first time since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that an Iranian president had been required to appear before lawmakers to answer their questions. 
The session itself seemed to reflect the emboldened position of Ayatollah Khamenei in a power struggle with Mr. Ahmadinejad, a former ally, who has irritated the supreme leader and alienated many members of the overwhelmingly conservative Parliament in recent years. Although Mr. Ahmadinejad is also a conservative and shares their antipathy toward the West and many Western values, some of his actions have challenged the Islamic religious hierarchy's pre-eminence.
Undaunted, Mr. Ahmadinejad declared at the outset that he did not want to attend, and he responded to the questions evasively, dismissively and sometimes sarcastically, offending the interrogators and leading some to call for his impeachment. At the least, the session amounted to an unusual public airing of the tensions in Iranian politics at a time when the country is straining under major outside pressure.
Analysts of Iranian politics said it was highly unlikely that Mr. Ahmadinejad would be impeached, a prospect the Parliament has often threatened. But some said the interrogation further diminished the prospects that he would be able to cultivate a protege to run in the 2013 presidential elections or even exert any political influence after his term expires. Such an outcome was already in doubt from the results of the March 2 parliamentary elections, in which his supporters lost many seats to rival conservatives.
''His opponents smell blood,'' said Alireza Nader, an expert on Iran at the Washington offices of the RAND Corporation, a research group. ''But in some ways the threat of Ahmadinejad has receded. I really don't see it in the interest of the system for him to resign or be impeached. It makes more sense for Ahmadinejad to fade away.''
An official catalog of 10 questions in the interrogation covered issues that included Mr. Ahmadinejad's unexplained personnel decisions, unachieved economic growth rates, Iran's acute inflation and mysteries over missing money allotted to improve Tehran's mass transit system.
Conspicuously absent in the questioning, however, was foreign policy, notably Mr. Ahmadinejad's defiance of Israel and the West in promoting Iran's disputed nuclear energy program, which is widely supported in Iran even though many Iranians are feeling the pressure from harsh economic sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union.
Two specific questions related to Mr. Ahmadinejad's efforts to dismiss his former intelligence and foreign ministers, moves that directly challenged Ayatollah Khamenei's authority.
Last year, the president tried to dismiss the chief of the Intelligence Ministry, the government branch that exerts widespread control over domestic life. Ayatollah Khamenei ordered that the minister, Heydar Moslehi, keep the post, but Mr. Ahmadinejad stayed home for 11 days before heeding the demand in what was taken as a show of pique.
''What justification did you have for your 11-day resistance to the supreme leader's decree?'' asked Ali Motahari, a lawmaker who is a conservative antagonist of Mr. Ahmadinejad's and asked the questions. Mr. Ahmadinejad denied he had defied the ayatollah and responded, ''Work did not stop for a single day.''
In late 2010, Mr. Ahmadinejad unceremoniously dumped Manouchehr Mottaki, the foreign minister and a Khamenei ally, while Mr. Mottaki was on a mission to Senegal.
The disputes weakened Ayatollah Khamenei's close bonds with Mr. Ahmadinejad, who was first elected in 2005 and won re-election in 2009 in a suspiciously lopsided vote, supported by the ayatollah. The election incited widespread political unrest that was harshly suppressed.
Questioned about his failure to control soaring prices of basic goods, which outside economists have partly attributed to the phasing out of state subsidies and a steep decline in the value of the rial, Iran's currency, Mr. Ahmadinejad was dismissive. ''The reason behind these inflations is something else which I will explain at a proper time,'' he said.
Questioned about his chief of staff, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who has been accused by lawmakers of heading a ''deviant current'' in contradiction to the principles of the Islamic Revolution, Mr. Ahmadinejad said only that he supports Iran's ''history.''
At the end, Mr. Ahmadinejad equated the questions to a school quiz concocted by simplistic instructors, and said he expected to get a top grade. ''To me, those who designed the question were among those who got a master's degree by just pushing a button,'' he said, provoking anger from lawmakers who considered him rude and condescending.
''Needless to say, Ahmadinejad did not endear himself to the deputies,'' said Mehrzad Boroujerdi, a professor of political science at Syracuse University.
In what appeared to be another political slap at Mr. Ahmadinejad, Ayatollah Khamenei announced on Wednesday the new makeup of the Expediency Council, a group of elders who act as advisers to the supreme leader. The most significant element of the announcement was the reappointment of Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president, as the council's chairman. Although he has a wary relationship with the ayatollah, Mr. Rafsanjani is known to deeply dislike Mr. Ahmadinejad. The new council members also included a former culture minister whom Mr. Ahmadinejad had dismissed.
Nonetheless, Iran political experts said that Mr. Ahmadinejad's own tenure seemed secure, judging by the confident insolence he displayed.
''His performance was the performance of a man safe in the knowledge that he will not be impeached,'' said Farideh Farhi, a professor at the University of Hawaii who is an expert on Iran. ''The members of Parliament cried foul that he insulted and mocked their questions,'' she said, ''but a concerted effort to push for the next step is highly unlikely because everyone is quite aware of the costs of bringing him down in the midst of all the external pressures Iran is under.''

HEADLINE: The Senate Overachieves

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Good news, frustrated American citizens! Congress is not a clogged up, hidebound legislative slug after all.
Bills were flying through the Senate on Wednesday like great flocks of geese soaring into the turbines of a passenger jet.
First, the senators passed legislation that would keep all the federally financed highway programs from coming to a screeching halt when money runs out at the end of this month. (Completely unnecessary disaster averted!)
Then, the party leaders came to an agreement on easing a bottleneck of uncontroversial judicial nominations. (People with no enemies cleared for hiring!) 
Some of you may be wondering how the judges got bottlenecked in the first place if they were uncontroversial. It's a long story. But, basically, the Republicans, irritated about totally unrelated matters, vented their frustration by putting their feet on the necks of helpless judicial nominees, people without an enemy in the world, who just wanted to go in and help clear up the critical case backload in the nation's federal courts.
''It's easy to make Republicans look bad,'' complained Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa, accurately.
Senator Charles Schumer of New York dared to hope that ''an idea of a moment of greater comity that we've seen this week is not just momentary, but will last on into the future.'' It was possibly not the most stirring prose ever, but it was hard to talk coherently with all the emotion in the air.
One of the great challenges for citizens in an era of partisan rancor is figuring out whether to applaud whenever our elected representatives manage to accomplish anything whatsoever. The bar is getting pretty low. Are we supposed to be thrilled that Congress managed to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration? Doesn't really seem much to ask. On the other hand, if you have seen this crowd in action, you know it's a wonder that they've managed to keep paying the air traffic controllers' salaries.
The transportation bill could actually have some trouble in the House, since the Republicans there were talking about slashing away at the spending and tying the whole thing to drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It used to be that, if nothing else, you could count on our men and women in Washington to work together when it came to passing lots and lots of highway projects. But no more, apparently. I think I speak for many Americans when I say that I miss the Bridge to Nowhere.
Still, we have not seen so much positive action since the House and Senate each passed a bill making it illegal for members of Congress to engage in insider trading. Although that one has not actually made it into law because of a disagreement between the two chambers on the definition of a lobbyist.
And, yeah, I know you thought it was illegal already.
After its run of accomplishment, the Senate did not rest on its laurels. No, it moved right on to begin consideration of a bipartisan bill -- passed in the House by an enormous margin -- that would remove investor protections in the financial marketplace.
Say what?
Ah, yes, the JOBS Act. JOBS stands for Jump-start Our Business Start-ups. Basically, it relieves businesses that are preparing to go public from some of the most important auditing regulations that Congress passed after the Enron debacle. Also, new public companies could delay following the rules on disclosing executive compensation that were passed after the 2008 Wall Street implosion. And salesmen could market stock in new companies to small investors on the Internet.
You could also call it the Just Open Bucket Shops Act.
But it's for small businesses! Small business is the heartbeat of the American economy, partly because the way politicians define it, the term includes virtually everyone. Enterprises so tiny that they are hardly a business. Endeavors so big that Republicans can argue that raising taxes on the richest 1 percent would be a terrible blow to small business owners.
These days, we are all small businesses.
And it was bipartisan! ''Democrats are eager to move this bill forward,'' said the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid. One of the biggest complaints about the bill in the House was from Democrats who claimed the Republicans had stolen it from them.
When it comes to deregulating business, all of the worst ideas in the modern history of Congress have been bipartisan to the core. People, when you see Republicans and Democrats together, holding hands and talking about unleashing the magic of the marketplace, hide your wallets.
Maybe we've had too much legislative achievement already.

HEADLINE: Firm's Penalty In Payroll Case Is $500 Million

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Kate Taylor and Benjamin Weiser contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A major government contractor agreed on Wednesday to pay a record $500 million to avoid federal prosecution for its role in the scandal-tarred CityTime project, an effort at modernizing New York's payroll system. The project was plagued by widespread fraud and weak oversight and became a lingering embarrassment for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration.
Under an agreement with federal prosecutors, the contractor, Science Applications International Corporation, will reimburse the city for about 80 percent of the money it spent on the project, whose budget ballooned to nearly $700 million, from $73 million, and was described by the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, as ''a fraudsters' field day that lasted seven years.''
The $500 million, in restitution and penalties, is believed to be the largest amount ever paid to resolve an accusation of contract fraud involving a state or local government, said Mr. Bharara, who announced the agreement at a news conference. 
Mr. Bloomberg hailed the deal as ''a major victory for taxpayers,'' but the scandal remained a potential taint on the legacy of a mayor who prides himself on managerial efficiency and the power of the private sector to reform government operations.
The CityTime project, with its promise of millions of dollars in cost savings thanks to newfangled technology like biometric readers, epitomized Mr. Bloomberg's technocratic approach to governing. City Hall officials say the payroll system, which was put in place despite the fraud, has improved a timekeeping operation once dependent on pen and paper. But the kickbacks and the ballooning costs raised doubts about the administration's ability to police its many outside contracts.
''CityTime is an example of how an allegiance to the notion that outside people are always better can be faulty,'' said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, who added that the Bloomberg administration had been overly eager to outsource projects to high-priced contractors rather than handle them in house.
''This administration has erred on the side of 'somebody outside will always be better,' and that's not always the case,'' Ms. Lerner said.
The federal government agreed not to press fraud charges against Science Applications International, a Fortune 500 company, if over the next three years the company complied with a series of reforms, including whistle-blower protections and the hiring of an independent monitor.
But the government's broader investigation into the CityTime scandal is continuing. Mr. Bharara's office has indicted 11 people working for private contractors in connection with the fraud: Two have pleaded guilty, and one has died. Prosecutors said Wednesday that they would seek to seize millions of dollars' worth of assets from the primary subcontractor on the project, TechnoDyne.
On Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg said that his administration had ''zero tolerance for corruption,'' while conceding, in a phrase he used twice during the news conference, that ''there will always be one or two bad apples.''
''Should we have known? Could we have known?'' the mayor asked. ''We keep strengthening all our surveillance, and, hopefully, we'll catch anything that happens again.''
The United States attorney's office began its investigation into CityTime after receiving evidence of criminal activity from the city's Department of Investigation, which collaborated on the ensuing case.
The City Council approved a bill on Wednesday that required the mayor to notify lawmakers about significant cost overruns on certain large city contracts. And late last year, the Council overrode a mayoral veto to enact a measure requiring City Hall to provide a cost-benefit analysis before it outsourced certain city projects.
''What we all have to learn from CityTime is we have to do a better job monitoring contracts every step of the way,'' the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said.
The CityTime project began in the Giuliani administration as an effort to modernize an onerous payroll system then managed entirely by hand. The Police Department, for instance, was generating 1.5 million sheets of paper each month for timekeeping.
Science Applications International took over the project in 2000, when it was worth $73 million, and prosecutors say that an elaborate kickback scheme emerged soon after, involving TechnoDyne, that provided staffing for the project in return for millions of dollars in kickbacks. In 2005, the company failed to report a whistle-blower's complaint to the city. Science Applications later hired hundreds of consultants from TechnoDyne for the project, significantly increasing costs, to $620 million as of last year. On Wednesday, the city said it had paid a total of $652 million for CityTime and had refused to pay an additional $41 million sought by Science Applications.
Throughout the project, the Bloomberg administration said that CityTime would be worth the growing cost. The system was finally started last year, and officials say it has saved the city tens of millions of dollars in annual costs, although the city could not provide an exact figure.
Mr. Bloomberg has demonstrated a proclivity for relying on outside expertise, particularly for projects involving modern technology. A study by the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group partially backed by unions, found that costs for contractual services had risen significantly during his administration, although labor costs for city employees have increased, as well.
Marc LaVorgna, a spokesman for the mayor, said in a statement that the city looked at every project individually to determine whether a contractor or an outside consultant was necessary.
''We evaluate each goal and make a decision on how to achieve it effectively and efficiently,'' Mr. LaVorgna wrote. ''Sometimes that means completing the work internally; sometimes it means using external support.''
Carol Kellermann, a former deputy commissioner of finance in the Koch administration, said outside contracts were unavoidable for a sprawling city government, particularly in major products involving technical expertise. But, she added, ''It is important to maintain very tight and sophisticated internal controls over the management of such projects.''
Despite the record agreement on Wednesday, one financial observer said the penalty would not create much of a problem for Science Applications International, whose numerous government contracts generate annual revenue that has exceeded $11 billion.
''It has a lot of happy customers across the government-contracting world, so it's hard to burn your reputation with a single incident,'' said Tim Quillin, a research analyst at the investment bank Stephens, based in Arkansas.
The $500 million payment, Mr. Quillin added, ''is a big settlement relative to the economic damage they may have done to the City of New York.''
''But in terms of S.A.I.C.'s ability to pay, this is not meaningful.''
And John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University and an expert on corporate governance, said the agreement would spare Science Applications International ''the collateral consequences of a criminal conviction,'' which could include not only the bad publicity of a trial, but also civil liability, the loss of licenses and a ban on access to public contracts.
Shares of Science Applications International Corporation closed at $12.84 apiece on Wednesday -- up 0.7 percent on the day.

HEADLINE: Romney Camp Shrugs Off Losses, Saying Lead Is Solid

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
Having fizzled once again in the South, Mitt Romney's presidential campaign is increasingly arguing that outcomes are not the only things that matter. Their premise: Mr. Romney can -- and will -- win even while losing.
After victories by Rick Santorum in the Alabama and Mississippi primaries, the campaigns were focusing on the next set of contests -- Puerto Rico, Missouri and Illinois -- in what promises to be a grinding effort to woo Republican voters for months to come.
''Tuesday's results actually increased Governor Romney's delegate lead, while his opponents only moved closer to their date of mathematical elimination,'' Rich Beeson, the campaign's political director, argued in a strategy memorandum on Wednesday.
Mr. Beeson may be right. By jumping out to an early lead in delegates in January, Mr. Romney has built himself a delegate cushion that should allow him to continue losing nominating contests without jeopardizing his lead over his main rivals, Mr. Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, and Newt Gingrich, a former speaker of the House. 
And a new national poll by the Pew Research Center shows Mr. Romney with a lead over Mr. Santorum among Republican voters, 33 percent to 24 percent.
The question Mr. Romney now faces is whether he can endure the psychological damage from that kind of campaign. Winning usually begets winning in the minds of voters, and a series of repeat disappointments could leave Mr. Romney saddled with low expectations among his supporters even as he prepares to face President Obama in the fall. The Pew poll showed Mr. Obama ahead of Mr. Romney by 12 points in a hypothetical matchup.
And Mr. Romney must make sure that the campaign's effort to frame its tactical approach -- an argument for mathematical inevitability -- does not supplant the campaign's overall political message to voters, that Mr. Romney is an economic fix-it man who can defeat President Obama.
Ahead of the Alabama and Mississippi primaries, Mr. Romney's advisers publicly predicted that he might win in one or both, apparently encouraged by the possibility that Mr. Santorum and Mr. Gingrich would split conservative voters and clear a path for Mr. Romney.
Mr. Romney even declared on Monday that, ''We're going to win tomorrow!''
In fact, as it became clear that he would sink to third place in Alabama and Mississippi, Mr. Romney skipped the traditional primary night speech in favor of a written statement that essentially shrugged off the losses as if they were nothing.
''With the delegates won tonight, we are even closer to the nomination,'' he wrote before heading to New York City on Wednesday for fund-raisers. ''Our campaign is on the move and ready to take on President Obama in the fall.''
Mr. Romney's advisers are still hoping that there will be victories to offset the losses. In the same strategy memo, Mr. Beeson wrote, ''So, despite Santorum wins over the last few days in Kansas, Alabama and Mississippi, Governor Romney's wins over the same period in Wyoming, the Northern Marianas, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Hawaii, and American Samoa have helped expand his delegate lead, pushing him closer to the nomination.'' In a late-night tweet, Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser, noted Mr. Romney's wins in two tiny contests even as he lost the big primaries in the Southern states.
''With overnight wins in Hawaii and American Samoa, Romney gets largest share of delegates out of yesterday's contests,'' Mr. Fehrnstrom wrote.
That earned a quick and mocking reply from David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser to Mr. Obama, who wrote on Twitter, ''You know what they say: as America Samoa goes, so goes the nation!''
Sensing that his opportunities have widened to stop Mr. Romney's march toward the nomination, Mr. Santorum on Tuesday night predicted that he would win the upcoming contests. Speaking to raucous supporters in Louisiana, he pledged to win big in the state's primary on March 24.
''Next week, we'll come back here, and we expect a huge win here in Cajun country,'' Mr. Santorum said. ''We will compete everywhere. The time is now for conservatives to pull together.''
And Mr. Gingrich, in his own speech after losing the primaries, mocked Mr. Romney for his continuing claims to be the front-runner of the Republican contest.
''If you're the front-runner and you keep coming in third, you're not much of a front-runner,'' Mr. Gingrich told a small crowd of supporters as he pledged to continue campaigning through the spring and summer.
But both men face challenges as they move ahead with campaigns that may increasingly be seen as damaging to the Republican Party's prospects of defeating Mr. Obama in the fall, particularly in the case of Mr. Gingrich, who is likely to face increasing calls to leave the race.
Cable news hosts spent much of the evening on Tuesday describing how difficult it will be for Mr. Santorum to catch up to Mr. Romney's lead in delegates, and noting that it is all-but impossible for Mr. Gingrich to do so.
Ahead of Tuesday's voting, Mr. Santorum's campaign pushed the idea that they could effectively block Mr. Romney from clinching the nomination before the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., this summer. But that argument is -- like Mr. Romney's -- hardly a positive message likely to inspire voters.
Residents of Puerto Rico and Missouri will vote over the weekend. The contest in Missouri may be an opportunity for Mr. Romney to embarrass his chief rival. Mr. Santorum won the state's nonbinding primary last month, but could lose the majority of delegates to Mr. Romney on Saturday.
The next big test for the candidates will be the following week.
On Tuesday, voters will go to the polls in Illinois, a state that should provide another test of how Mr. Romney and Mr. Santorum can appeal to the Midwestern sensibilities of voters. Mr. Romney had built up an early lead in the state, but polls had shown a tighter race there even before Mr. Santorum's Southern victories. Still, Mr. Santorum has failed to file a full slate of delegates in several Congressional districts, meaning he could win the vote in the state, but lose the delegate count to Mr. Romney.
On Wednesday, Mr. Romney's campaign announced the endorsement of Tom Ridge, a former secretary of homeland security and a former governor of Mr. Santorum's home state of Pennsylvania. Mr. Romney's campaign is hoping that endorsements from people like Mr. Ridge will help in primaries like Illinois, and also in Pennsylvania, which will vote on April 24.
''Given the economic problems that America faces, including Pennsylvania, where high unemployment continues to cause such hardship, his experience turning around failing enterprises makes him precisely what the country needs,'' Mr. Ridge said of Mr. Romney in a statement. ''I'm proud to endorse Mitt's candidacy and will work hard to help him recapture the White House this coming November.''
On March 24, the race returns to the South for the Louisiana primary. Mr. Santorum is already predicting success. Given Mr. Romney's track record in the South -- he has lost five big contests in Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama -- it is possible that he might choose not to compete in Louisiana.
But Mr. Romney's campaign has tended not to shy away from contests where he is not expected to do well. In Iowa, where he struggled in 2008, Mr. Romney competed hard, losing in the end to Mr. Santorum by just a few votes.
In part, that may be a desire by Mr. Romney and his advisers to prove that he is a national candidate who is not afraid to show up. It is also the central part of his delegate-accumulation strategy. Picking up the delegates means competing -- even if it also means losing.

But in December, Mr. Eisen received surprising news. His company, Tennier Industries, which is in a depressed corner of Tennessee, would not receive a new $45 million contract.
Tennier lost the deal not to a private sector competitor, but to a corporation owned by the federal government, Federal Prison Industries.
Federal Prison Industries, also known as Unicor, does not have to worry much about its overhead. It uses prisoners for labor, paying them 23 cents to $1.15 an hour. Although the company is not allowed to sell to the private sector, the law generally requires federal agencies to buy its products, even if they are not the cheapest. 
Mr. Eisen, who laid off about 100 workers after losing out on the new contract, said the system took sorely needed jobs from law-abiding citizens. ''Our government screams, howls and yells how the rest of the world is using prisoners or slave labor to manufacture items, and here we take the items right out of the mouths of people who need it,'' he said.
Although Federal Prison Industries has been around for decades, its critics are gaining more sympathy this year as jobs, competition and the role of government have become potent political issues. Recently, a clothing company complained that the government company had expressed interest in making Air Force windbreakers like one worn by the president. Last month, amid negative news reports and pressure from the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, F.P.I. said it would stop competing for the contract because it could damage the private company that makes the jackets, Ashland Sales and Service.
In addition, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers is resuscitating a bill to overhaul the way the prison manufacturing company does business, proposing to eliminate its preferential status.
Under current practice -- governed by intricate laws, regulations and policies -- an agency must buy prisoner-made goods if the company offers an item that is comparable in price, quality and time of delivery to that of the private sector, with certain exceptions. The company's prices are not always the lowest, but it frequently has been able to underbid private companies, Congressional aides say.
The bill seeks to limit those advantages by putting a limit on F.P.I.'s sales to the federal government, opening more product areas to private companies and strengthening requirements that the prices for prisoner-made products be competitive. The legislation would also impose federal work-safety standards and higher wages, starting at $2.50 an hour.
Separately, Senator McConnell has introduced a bill that would subject the Bureau of Prisons, including its manufacturing company, to greater Congressional oversight.
F.P.I. has traditionally relied on office furniture, electronics and clothing manufacturing for the bulk of its business, but it has been moving into new industries like renewable energy. The company already has one factory each in New York and Oregon to build solar panels and is looking into making energy-efficient lighting and small wind turbines.
''This is a threat to not just established industries; it's a threat to emerging industries,'' said Representative Bill Huizenga, a Michigan Republican who is the lead sponsor of the proposed overhaul legislation. ''If China did this -- having their prisoners work at subpar wages in prisons -- we would be screaming bloody murder.''
Begun in 1934 as a way to teach inmates useful skills and help supply federal agencies with needed products, Federal Prison Industries is something of an anachronism. Its operations are patterned after a ''mass-production, low-skilled labor economy of the 1930s,'' according to a report last year from the Congressional Research Service. It is at root a correctional program intended to keep inmates busy (and therefore less likely to become violent), reinforce the value of work and the sense of self-worth work can provide, and reduce recidivism. It is inefficient by design, employing as many inmates as possible, which diminishes the advantage of its low wages.
''The program has been important to the Federal Bureau of Prisons for a long time,'' said George Keiser, a consultant and former official at the National Institute of Corrections in the Justice Department. ''It's one of the areas where they can demonstrate a high correlation between people who work in prison industries and who eventually, as they return to their communities, have a higher-than-average success rate at not being rearrested, not being reconvicted and not returning to prison.''
According to the Bureau of Prisons, inmates who go through the program are 24 percent less likely to return to jail and 14 percent more likely to find employment upon release because of the skills and experience they receive. The program operates in a range of industries -- including fleet management and data services -- to lessen the effect on any particular one. Over the years, its board has adopted various resolutions to reduce competition with small businesses, like raising the threshold for buying the prisoner-made goods to $3,000, from $25, and eliminating its preferential status for products when the prison share of the federal market rises above certain levels.
''F.P.I. supplies only a small fraction of the government's goods and services,'' Traci Billingsley, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons, said in a prepared statement. ''F.P.I. also helps support American jobs as it often partners with private American companies as a supplier.'' (Mr. Eisen said Tennier once received a contract to provide precut fabric for military gear to the government company so it could avoid having inmates use cutting equipment.)
With a tight economy, dwindling agency budgets and past Congressional moves to weaken its preferential status, the prison manufacturing company has faced its own business pressures, closing down some factories and employing fewer inmates. Its overall sales fell to about $745 million in fiscal 2011 from about $772 million the year before, according to its annual report to Congress. Its net loss narrowed to $1.8 million from $56.3 million the year before, when it took $35 million in write-offs for defective helmets recalled by the military -- still the subject of a Justice Department investigation -- and for solar cells.
''F.P.I. continues to face the negative impact of economic and legislative forces,'' the report says. ''F.P.I. continues to address these external challenges through aggressively pursuing new customers and new products, involvement in legislative initiatives, capacity reductions and strict measures to control cash.''
The move into solar panels and other energy technologies is meant to help government agencies meet mandates for using energy from renewable sources and to ''provide inmates with job skills in a new and growing market,'' according to Julie Rozier, a spokeswoman for the company.
Across the country, some correctional facilities have begun preparing inmates for the green economy, offering training in solar panel installation and energy-efficient heating, ventilation and cooling systems. Inmates do not install solar panels, but assemble them; when fully operational, the plants in Otisville, N.Y., and Sheridan, Ore., can employ about 400 inmates and produce 75 megawatts' worth of panels a year, Ms. Rozier said.
So far, response from the solar industry has been measured, with representatives saying that production is too small to pose a serious threat. A pool of trained solar workers might even be beneficial, the Solar Energy Industries Association says.
But industries that have long been competing against the federal company, like the clothing and furniture industries, are leaning on lawmakers to do something.
Chris Reynolds, president of Campbellsville Apparel in Kentucky, said he had contacted Senator McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, to express concern about possible competition for his military T-shirt contract, a move that inspired Mr. McConnell's bill.
''My employees just cannot believe the fact that a prisoner who should be paying a debt to society is being promoted through the federal government to take a job from an American taxpaying citizen,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Who Wants to Donate to a Billionaire's Museum?

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
WHEN Eli Broad, the art collector and philanthropist, decided to build a museum in downtown Los Angeles, he named it The Broad. That pretty much ruled out asking anybody else for money, said Barry Munitz, a governor of the Broad Foundation. The museum, about to break ground on a Diller Scofidio & Renfro building, will have an initial $200 million endowment and has no plans to seek outside funding, according to Joanne Heyler, who will be its director.
But there's another Broad museum, this one nearing completion at Michigan State University, in East Lansing. Mr. Broad (pronounced Brode), a Michigan State alumnus, and his wife, Edythe, gave $28 million to that cause -- far less than the cost of the museum's new Zaha Hadid building. And that means the museum's director, Michael Rush, has to raise money before the museum opens this year. ''We still have a few million to go,'' he said by phone. 
But who will donate to a museum named for one of the wealthiest couples in America? (Its official name is the Eli and Edythe Broad Art Museum.) As Lou Anna K. Simon, the president of Michigan State University, said at an event to publicize the museum, ''Some people think Eli can just write another check.'' Not only that, but the name on the door suggests that no mater how much a donor contributes, the credit will go to the Broads.
Luckily, Mr. Rush said, the university's hundreds of thousands of alumni are known for their school spirit. It also helps that the museum is offering naming opportunities; one gallery will bear the name of Edward Minskoff, the New York real estate developer and a Michigan State graduate. Mr. Minskoff wrote in an e-mail that the Broad name, if anything, encouraged him to give. ''Eli is one of the most important collectors in the world, and it will only serve to attract other prominent contributors,'' he wrote.
Often, though, putting a wealthy donor's name on the door discourages giving, according to Mr. Munitz and other experts. (He named the Menil Collection in Houston, the Nasher Sculpture Center in Dallas and the Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts in St. Louis as three museums facing that challenge.)
When Mr. Munitz was president of the J. Paul Getty Trust -- endowed by the oil company founder -- ''it was hard to ask for money with a straight face,'' he said. But the trust, he said, is not without need; it is wealthy enough ''to do anything it wants to do, which is different from being able to do everything it wants to do.'' These days, he said, it seeks donors for some purposes.
Fund-raising may be easier for an institution named for a less towering figure than J. Paul Getty or Eli Broad. The Skirball Cultural Center, a Jewish museum in Los Angeles, was named for Jack Skirball and Audrey Skirball-Kenis, wealthy Californians, but its director, Mr. Munitz said, ''has always made it clear that the institutionwouldn't survive and prosper without other major donors.'' One such donor, Lloyd Cotsen, the former president of the skin care products company Neutrogena, endowed what is now known as the Cotsen Auditorium at the Skirball Cultural Center. ''There wasn't the sense that other donors would be in the Skirballs' shadow,'' said Mr. Munitz, who is the president of Mr. Cotsen's foundation.
In Arkansas, the Crystal Bridges Museum was built with a gift from Alice Walton, an heir to the Wal-Mart fortune, and received $800 million in additional funds from the Walton Family Foundation. Don Bacigalupi, the museum's director, said it had not been difficult to raise additional money. One reason, of course, is that the museum isn't named Walton.
But even if it had been, Mr. Bacigalupi said, that might not have discouraged donors, because of excitement in the community about the project, which, he said, was fueled by the Walton association.
The museum has signed up 6,000 members, about twice as many as its top executives had expected, since it began its membership program last year. And many of those members gave far more than the $35 minimum -- in some cases, thousands of dollars more. Asked if the donors were looking to curry favor with the Waltons -- who control much of the economy of this part of Arkansas -- Mr. Bacigalupi answered no. After all, being one of thousands of members is akin to being anonymous. Larger donors are not anonymous -- the Willard and Pat Walker Charitable Foundation gave $10 million to defray the cost of bringing school groups to the museum (even covering lunch and transportation). But Mr. Walker made his money as a Wal-Mart executive, and the Walkers are part of what Mr. Bacigalupi described as a group of prominent families who pitch in to support each other' projects. He said the museum was benefiting from a ''tradition of generosity'' in northwest Arkansas.
Things may be a little different in South Florida, where last year the Miami Art Museum was renamed the Jorge M. Perez Art Museum of Miami-Dade County, in honor of the condominium developer. Mr. Perez, president of the Related Group, got his name on the door by pledging $35 million in cash and artworks, a fraction of the cost of the museum's new building, designed by Herzog & de Meuron and now under construction.
According to Craig Robins, a museum trustee and prominent Miami collector, the decision to put Mr. Perez's name on the building presents fund-raising challenges. It's a trade-off, he said. ''Some people will be less inspired to support it. Jorge and his associates will be more inspired. The hope is that the museum will gain more than it will lose.''
Mr. Robins said the Perez name would not discourage him from giving. After all, he said, ''I've supported the Bass. I've supported the Hirshhorn. I've supported the Whitney.'' Thom Collins, the museum's director, said ''a few board members'' had decided not to fulfill pledges, resulting in a loss to the museum of about $2 million. But, he said, Mr. Perez gave the museum a list of people it otherwise would not have access to -- resulting in four or five major gifts. Of the association with Mr. Perez, he said, ''I'm very optimistic that not only will it not hurt us in terms of our capital campaign, but that we are actually able to capitalize on it.''
Some critics thought the museum sold the naming rights too cheaply. But anyone who thinks Mr. Perez is getting away with something -- his name on the institution in exchange for a relatively small donation -- should consider the other side of the coin, in Mr. Robins's view.
''Jorge Perez has taken an incredible burden upon himself,'' Mr. Robins said. ''If the museum ends up being unsuccessful, he will suffer a greater loss than anyone.''
And that may be why Mr. Perez has said that, if someone wants to exceed his $35 million gift, he will gladly give up the naming rights to the museum.
Mr. Broad?

HEADLINE: When Populism Is Sound

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The powerful bankers who helped weaken the economy and the public officials who won't taken them on are the real problem, not the advocates of regulation, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
"Populism" is a loaded term in modern American politics. On the one hand, it conveys the idea that someone represents (or claims to represent) the broad mass of society against a privileged elite. This is a theme that plays well on the right as well as the left - although they sometimes have different ideas about who is in that troublesome "elite."
At the same time, populism is often used in a pejorative way - as a putdown, implying "the people" want irresponsible things that would undermine the fabric of society or the smooth functioning of the economy. 
In Latin America, for example, there is a long tradition of populists' falling into bed with a corrupt political elite, and the results invariably include irresponsible macroeconomic policies and various kinds of financial disaster (see "The Macroeconomics of Populism in Latin America," edited by Rudiger Dornbush and Sebastian Edwards).
In North America, however, the populist tradition has proved much more constructive. More than 100 years ago, hot-button issues included direct election of senators and a federal income tax. None of these demands seem irresponsible today, and achieving those goals through constitutional amendments in the period before 1914 in no way jeopardized American prosperity.
But there is still an undercurrent of resistance in Washington to policy ideas with widespread popular support. For example, when President Obama said to leading bankers in March 2009, "My administration is the only thing between you and the pitchforks," he was suggesting that people favoring a resolution process for large financial institutions - closing them down in an orderly fashion - were akin to some kind of a peasants' revolt. 
According to Mr. Obama's framing of the issues, the administration sided with large banks that were in trouble at the beginning of his administration - and bailed them out repeatedly and on generous terms - because this was the responsible thing to do. 
This was a mistake, with lasting consequences for the American economy, because it further entrenched the power of these banks and the people who ran them into the ground. It also changed our politics. On financial regulation, anti-elite ideas have broad appeal and represent the responsible course of action - and they should draw support from across the political spectrum.

Populism and irresponsibility are not, in fact, synonyms. When any elite gets out of control and makes egregious financial mistakes, which happens in many societies, the choice is either to rein it in or provide it with unlimited state backing. You can imagine which course is preferred by that powerful elite and, not surprisingly, the "capture the state" approach is often what leads to the most trouble - including irresponsible macroeconomic policies, worsening inequality and further rounds of traumatic crisis. 
In their new book, "Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty," Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson suggest that most economic and political collapse is caused by overly powerful elites - which bring on a wide variety of pathologies.
In early 2009, the people who wanted to arrange the orderly liquidation of failed banks in the United States included Sheila Bair, the entirely reasonable and middle-of-the-road head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Ms. Bair was also an outspoken advocate of higher capital requirements and meaningful financial reform more broadly. 
According to the definitive account published recently by Jesse Eisinger of ProPublica, she was opposed and largely thwarted not just by top political appointees (e.g., at the Treasury) but also by the Federal Reserve.
Ms. Bair is a Republican; at one point she worked for Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. But she draws broad bipartisan support for standing up to the banks and consistently proposing a more responsible course of action than that preferred by the banking elite. I have heard sensible people on both sides of the political aisle suggest that she would make a very fine Treasury secretary, and I agree with that assessment.
Elizabeth Warren is another prominent public figure who stands for reasonable constraints on egregious bad behavior by powerful financial interest groups. Ms. Warren was chairwoman of the Congressional Oversight Panel for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, and in that capacity she drew broad bipartisan support for her even-handed assessments. 
When she helped set up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Ms. Warren stood primarily for greater transparency in financial transactions, making it easier for people to understand what they are getting themselves into. Many responsible businesses supported exactly that approach.
This week, Ms. Warren and three other former officials from the oversight panel criticized the way in which the government has helped A.I.G. through nontransparent tax breaks - details of which have only now become public. 
As Ms. Warren put it, "When the government bailed out A.I.G., it should not have allowed the failed insurance giant to duck taxes for years to come." She was joined in her condemnation of the administration by Damon Silvers, a Democrat, and J. Mark McWatters and Kenneth Troske, who are Republicans.
Ms. Warren is running for the Senate in Massachusetts and seems likely to be picked as the Democratic nominee. The Republican incumbent, Scott Brown, opposed every dimension of financial reform. I do not recall his support for or even interest in any attempt - by the left or the right (and I've worked with both) - to make banking safer. The issues do not even appear in the policy section of his Web site.
To be clear, Mr. Brown eventually voted for the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation in 2010, but only in return for the watering down of meaningful changes, "including helping strip out a proposed $19 billion bank tax and weakening a proposal to stop commercial banks from holding large interests in hedge funds and private equity funds." He now draws considerable financial support from Wall Street, where some executives seem willing to do whatever it takes to prevent the election of Elizabeth Warren.
Mr. Brown presents himself as bipartisan - presumably as a way to garner favor with Massachusetts voters. "I'm not a 'rock thrower'" is his line - which is very close to saying, "I do not have a pitchfork."
But the people throwing rocks at our economy are not reasonable reformers like Ms. Bair and Ms. Warren. Important parts of our financial elite, particularly the people who ran large financial institutions, went out of control in the period leading up to 2008. Powerful bankers wreaked havoc with our economy, destroyed millions of jobs and directly caused a huge increase in the national debt. These people and their successors are now poised to get out of control again.
Two developments on Wednesday speak to the continuing dangers surrounding an unreformed financial sector. The very public resignation of Greg Smith from Goldman Sachs illuminated an insider's view of Wall Street culture and suggested that it has not changed much, if at all, in the last few years. 
And even under the most favorable interpretation, the results of the bank stress tests run by the Federal Reserve found that some banks are still struggling. I agree with Anat Admati of Stanford - these stress tests were not tough enough, again raising questions about whether the degree of "regulatory capture" has also changed since the crisis.
The politicians to fear are those like Scott Brown, who refuse to stand up to Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Labor's Take on the Economy

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: A resolution by the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council is a full-throated liberal-left take on what's ailing the American economy and what caused those ailments. 

 BODY:
 ORLANDO, Fla. -- When labor leaders talk publicly, it's often to make angry, off-the-cuff statements to denounce a company that is taking a tough line on wage increases or to lambaste a lawmaker who is sponsoring anti-union legislation.
But when the nation's union leaders gather each winter at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s executive council meeting, the statements they issue are usually far different. They often approve carefully crafted resolutions that the labor federation's staff members -- some have Ph.D.'s -- have spent weeks preparing in close consultation with union leaders. Clearly much work and thought went into the resolution on the economy that the labor federation approved on Wednesday, titled "Fixing What Is Wrong With Our Economy." 
The resolution is in part cri de coeur on behalf of embattled workers, but it is mainly a full-throated liberal-left take on what's ailing the American economy and what caused those ailments. As one would suspect, organized labor's analysis is not sympathetic to Wall Street, deregulation and free trade. 
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O., representing 57 unions and with considerable influence on the White House, said that the recession and financial crisis that the nation plunged into four years ago were three decades in the making. The labor group's economic resolution asserted that the North American Free Trade Agreement, admitting China into the World Trade Organization and a long-overvalued dollar had fueled the relocation of American operations overseas. 
Decrying "the hollowing out" of the economy, the resolution added that by the 1980s the nation's financial sector was failing to perform its "essential function" of channeling savings to productive investment in the real economy, focusing instead on various forms of complex financial engineering and "making a quick buck by stripping assets from existing business and downsizing their work forces."

"The deindustrialization of America and the substitution of speculation for productive investment were not accidents, they were not inevitable, and they were not the outcome of natural forces," the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said. "They were the predictable results of mistaken policy choices made by politicians of both parties for more than a generation." 
 The labor federation asserted that many factors had fueled America's growing inequality, including the loss of well-paying manufacturing jobs, the rise of finance, "the abandonment of full employment in favor of fighting inflation," corporate attacks on the ability of workers to unionize, "the erosion of the minimum wage" and "massive tax cuts for the wealthy."
 "In the end, nearly two-thirds of the pretax income gains after 1979 were captured by the richest 10 percent and more than half was captured by the richest 1 percent," the resolution said.
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O. argued that rising inequality was bad for the economy as a whole, causing less affluent households to spend more than their income and rely on borrowing to an unhealthy degree.
"The weakness of the economy was temporarily papered over by a bubble in real estate prices at the turn of the 21st century, which was made possible by the deregulation of Wall Street," the resolution said. "Instead of broad-based, sustainable growth fueled by rising wages and investment, the U.S. economy was artificially inflated by complex financial engineering that made credit more easily available and exposed the entire economy to enormous risk."
To restore the economy to health, the labor federation had several recommendations. First, it said, "if we want to be competitive with Germany and China in the 21st century, we will need trillions of dollars in productive public investment over the next 10 years" in education, apprentice programs, retraining, and infrastructure for the energy, manufacturing,and transportation sectors. It added, "We need to start making things in America again." To revive manufacturing, it called for bringing the nation's swollen trade under control and ending "the overvaluation of the U.S. dollar" as well as "currency manipulation by our trading partners." 
"One thing is clear," the resolution concluded. "We can no longer rely on household debt, real estate bubbles, tech bubbles, stock bubbles or any other kind of bubbles to fuel our economic growth. We cannot go back to a low-wage, high-consumption economy. We need bold leadership to draw the right lessons from the mistakes of the past 30 years."

HEADLINE: More Homeowners Seek Reverse Mortgages at Earlier Age

BYLINE: TARA SIEGEL BERNARD


HIGHLIGHT: A new study suggested that more people are taking out reverse mortgages at earlier ages to help them deal urgent financial needs. 

 BODY:
Reverse mortgages have always been viewed as a last resort -- something that older retirees could turn to when they desperately needed to supplement their dwindling incomes. But in the wake of the housing market's collapse and high unemployment, a new study has found that people are using reverse mortgages to alleviate more urgent financial pressures, like paying off debt. And homeowners are applying for these loans at much younger ages than they have in the past.
Reverse mortgages allow people age 62 and older to tap what may be their biggest asset, the equity in their home, without having to make any payments. Instead, the bank pays the borrowers, though they continue to be responsible for paying property taxes and homeowner's insurance. When borrowers are ready to sell (or when they die), the bank takes its share of the proceeds from the sale, and borrowers (or their heirs) receive whatever is left.
The study, conducted by the MetLife Mature Market Institute and the National Council on Aging, analyzed data collected from reverse mortgage applicants who went through mandatory counseling sessions with government-approved counselors. The study covers 21,240 sessions from September through November 2010.
"Consumer attitudes about reverse mortgages are changing because the recession has eroded confidence about retirement security, and Americans will rely more and more on these measures," said Sandra Timmermann, director of the MetLife Mature Market Institute. "As reverse mortgages do not have income requirements and since other forms of credit have become less accessible, these loans will become more attractive."
The research found that about 21 percent of homeowners who went through counseling were 62 to 64 years old -- even though you can pull less money out the younger you are. That's a sharp rise from the 6 percent of borrowers in that age group who applied for reverse mortgages in 1999. Those findings are also consistent with a recent industry analysis that found a dramatic shift toward younger borrowers in the past few years.
And while the average age of the borrower is 73 years old, as the chart above shows, the average age of homeowners who went through the counseling was 71.5 years old. That is consistent, the study said, with the housing department's findings. "As we look more closely at the age distribution of recent counseling clients, it appears that this broad trend may conceal the start of a major generational shift in the use of reverse mortgage loans," the study said.
Of homeowners who are considering a reverse mortgage, nearly 46 percent are under the age of 70, according to the study.
The vast majority of counseling clients in 2010, or 67 percent, were seeking the reverse mortgage to lower their household debt. Only 27 percent were considering it to improve their quality of life. Most recent counseling clients (67 percent) said they had a conventional mortgage that needed to be repaid if they decided to take out the mortgage, whereas 27 percent reported having both housing and nonhousing debt. Naturally, using their equity to repay the debt means they will have less left should they need to access it in the future.
For nearly one-third of counseling clients, the existing mortgage may exceed half the value of their home, the study said. That means they may not have enough equity to qualify for the mortgage, or they have to wait several years until they can qualify for a loan that's large enough to satisfy their financial needs.
Mostreverse mortgages originate through the Department of Housing's Home Equity Conversion Mortgages program -- known as HECM (pronounced HECK-um) -- which has become more popular over the past 10 years. There have also been many changes to the program, including a new loan option known as the "HECM Saver," which requires lower upfront fees. That version came out in October of 2010, so the study noted that its results may reflect the fact that more homeowners considered those loans, though it's unlikely that it had a major effect.
The study's authors also point out that more homeowners are likely to incorporate home equity into their retirement plans, instead of tapping it for emergencies only. "It is likely the reverse mortgage option will be considered alongside some of the more traditional methods of saving and investment," said Barbara Stucki, vice president for home equity initiatives at the National Council on Aging.
The study also included a consumer guide to reverse mortgages.

HIGHLIGHT: GMC unveiled a Denali edition of its entry-level crossover, the Terrain, on Wednesday. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 On Wednesday evening, General Motors introduced the 2013 GMC Terrain Denali, a higher-zoot version of its compact crossover, with luxury amenities and the option of a more powerful engine. The Terrain's 3-liter V-6 has been replaced by a version of the direct-injection 3.6-liter V-6 found elsewhere in G.M.'s product line, including in the Cadillac SRX crossover and CTS sedan, producing 301 horsepower in the Terrain. GMC says the 3.6-liter power plant achieves the same fuel economy as its less powerful predecessor. The standard 182-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder engine would still be available at the Denali trim level, which includes chrome exterior finishes, Denali badges on the leather seats and a touch-screen infotainment system. Pricing will be announced this fall. (General Motors)
 A Nissan dealer in Petaluma, Calif., recently nullified the purchase of a Murano CrossCabriolet by a 70-year-old man said to suffer from dementia. The dealership, North Bay Nissan, faced legal action by the man's estranged wife, who asserted that her husband was not thinking clearly when he made the purchase. In acquiescing to her demands, representatives for the dealership invited local media to review notes of the transaction, as well as lucid voice-mail messages left by the buyer for the sales representative after the purchase. The individual had agreed to monthly payments of $973 for the CrossCabriolet, a vehicle widely deemed the least attractive of the 2011 model year. (San Jose Mercury News)
 The 2004 Maybach 57 that transformed into a V-12-powered "Mad Max" joyrider in a music video for "Otis," a single by Jay-Z and Kanye West, was recently auctioned in New York. At the Phillips de Pury contemporary art event on March 8, the Maybach was sold for $60,000, with proceeds benefiting Save the Children, an international philanthropic organization. The car carried a preauction estimate of $100,000-$150,000. (Phillips de Pury)
 In an interview with Top Gear, Filippo Perini, the director of Lamborghini's design center in Bologna, Italy, said the Aventador J roadster introduced at the 2012 Geneva auto show last week was completed in six weeks. Stephan Winkelmann, the brand's chief executive, asked Mr. Perini and his team in mid-January for "something special" for Geneva. The resulting one-off design shared the Aventador coupe's hood, fenders and headlights, but otherwise consisted of specially fabricated panels, Mr. Perini said. (Top Gear)
 Responding to demand for small, fuel-efficient cars in Southeast Asia, Honda announced Thursday that it would build a new production plant in Indonesia, at an expected cost of roughly $324 million. The new plant would have annual capacity of 120,000 vehicles, augmenting the capacity of the automaker's current plant, which is rated at 60,000 units. Honda expects the plant to come online in 2014.

HEADLINE: Unions Urge Curtailment of 'Super PACs'

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: Unions may be benefiting from a ruling allowing for "super PACs," but they still want their activities curtailed. 

 BODY:
 ORLANDO, Fla. - Leaders of the nation's labor unions -- which some experts say benefited from the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling in 2010 -- said on Wednesday that the ruling needed to be overturned for the good of American democracy,
 Recognizing that the court is unlikely to overturn the decision, the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the nation's main union federation, said the United States should consider a constitutional amendment to effectively overturn Citizens United, which allowed unlimited independent campaign spending by business corporations and labor unions.
 Although some union leaders say organized labor will spend $400 million this year on national, state and local campaigns, many union officials are voicing fears that billionaire donors and corporations will spend huge amounts that will swamp labor's efforts. Union leaders have been meeting in Orlando at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s annual winter meeting.
Asserting that the Supreme Court's decision "seriously undermined our democracy," the federation of 57 labor unions approved a resolution saying:
The Citizens United ruling has opened the floodgates to massive spending by corporations and even more so by wealthy donors. They are pouring money into our electoral system and threaten to drown out the voices of hard-working Americans. 
 The labor group said "common-sense restrictions" on this spending were needed, including disclosure of their expenditures and their contributions to "super PACs" and to politically active nonprofit groups. 
 To help offset the effects of the Supreme Court ruling, the union group said it supported public financing of campaigns and limits on individual contributions to campaigns. It also praised the idea of abolishing corporate "personhood" in states across the country with an eye to making it easier to limit corporations' ability to spend or contribute corporate money to influence political campaigns. 
 "Business groups are not people - they are man-made creatures of law that exist to generate economic activity and create jobs and income in communities," the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s said. "The notion that they should enjoy the same rights and protections as natural persons is absurd and it is destructive to our democracy." 
The labor resolution was quick to add that corporations should enjoy certain constitutional protections, for instance, protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.
Efforts to reach the business-financed groups engaging in such activity were not immediately successful.
 The A.F.L.-C.I.O. urged the Supreme Court and Congress to uphold the reforms it said were needed to protect American democracy from the power of money.
 "As long as Citizens United remains the law of the land, constitutional change may be the only option," the A.F.L.-C.I.O. said. "Amending the U.S. Constitution should be a rare act, done with the greatest of care," and "narrowly crafted to protect our democracy from the economic power of the 1 percent."
 Not surprisingly, the labor unions sought to draw sharp distinctions between their political spending and corporations' spending -- they said that unions were democratic organizations run on the basis of one member one vote. "Any campaign finance reform," the labor federation said, "needs to recognize the fundamental distinction between the democratically governed communications among working people through unions and the unaccountable spending by corporations and the rich."

HEADLINE: Wall Street's Latest Campus Recruiting Crisis

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: The industry, which has faced a loss of cachet since the financial disaster, is now dealing with the marketing crisis from the public resignation letter of Greg Smith, a former Goldman Sachs executive director. 

 BODY:
Wall Street, once a magnet for America's best and brightest, is facing a recruiting problem.
The industry's cachet, which was tarnished during the financial disaster, has been further stained by the lingering economic slowdown and a series of highly publicized industry scandals that have drawn critical attention to the big banks.
The most recent public relations storm stemmed from a resignation letter this week on The New York Times Op-Ed page, written by Greg Smith, a former Goldman Sachs executive director. Mr. Smith, who took the bank to task over what he described as a "toxic and destructive" culture at the firm, said his moment of ultimate realization had come while extolling the benefits of a Goldman career to college students.
"I knew it was time to leave when I realized I could no longer look students in the eye and tell them what a great place this was to work," he wrote.
The controversy has raised fears - perhaps within Goldman itself - that skittish clients and down-in-the-mouth employees could bolt. But financial firms should also worry that the incident might scare off college and business school students, some of whom are looking askance at once-prestigious jobs in finance.
Cory Finley, a recent Yale graduate, applied to work at Bridgewater Associates, a large Connecticut-based hedge fund, during his senior year of college. Mr. Finley, 23, said there was "definitely something tempting" about the structure and prestige of a high-paying finance job. But he decided to follow his dream of becoming a playwright instead.
"It's something that fulfills me in a deep way," said Mr. Finley, who has written a play called "The Private Sector" that is set at a hedge fund corporate retreat. "I don't judge people who do go into finance, but it's not for me personally."
College students who were once attracted to prestigious banks like moths to bonfires are increasingly turning to other industries in search of success. Insiders say that harsh testimonials of industry life can deter would-be financiers from even applying for jobs at the most selective firms.
"This is a significant problem for Goldman," said Adam Zoia, the chief executive of the placement firm Glocap Search, whose clients include many aspiring big-bank employees and hedge fund workers. "Their perch of being the investment bank to go to is definitely at risk."
One former Goldman analyst recently decided to leave the firm after the rewards of a finance job no longer seemed to outweigh the costs. He is now working at a small technology start-up for less money.
"Perhaps Smith is a catalyst," said the employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because many of his friends still worked at the bank.
"There have always been unhappy people" in finance, he added, but "this is the year people are realizing things are structurally different."
Smaller paychecks and waves of layoffs are only making the decision easier for some students, who no longer view Wall Street as a fast track to seven-figure salaries. Last year, flagging profits at many financial firms reduced some bankers' compensation from stratospheric to merely generous. At Morgan Stanley, cash bonuses were capped at $125,000; annual cash payments for some Goldman employees were cut in half.
Adding to the chorus of dissent, students now face criticism on their own campuses. Groups of protestors at Yale and Harvard stood outside bank recruiting sessions last fall, shouting slogans and holding signs with messages like "Take a chance, don't go into finance." At Princeton, a group affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement interrupted sessions by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, urging their fellow students to rebel against what it said was "the campus culture that whitewashes the crooked dealings of Wall Street as a prestigious career path."
"Everything from Occupy Wall Street to larger critical discourses of 'fat cats,' all of that has had some trickle-down effect" to young people, said Karen Ho, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Minnesota, who has studied the culture of Wall Street.
The decline in the finance industry's allure has been accelerated by the explosion of the technology industry. A 2011 survey of 6,700 young professionals by the consulting firm Universum ranked Google, Apple and Facebook as the most coveted workplaces; JPMorgan Chase, the highest-ranking bank on the survey, was 41st.
At this year's SXSW Interactive conference in Austin, Tex., a panel called "Keeping Kids off the Street: Wall St. vs. Start-ups" was convened to address questions including whether the finance industry was to blame for what organizers called a "failure to nurture a culture of innovation" in New York. Chris Wiggins, an associate professor of applied math at Columbia University who sat on the panel, said he was seeing students shy away from Wall Street and veer toward industries where they could work and profit without bringing their morality under the microscope.
"The claim of investment banking that it serves a social purpose by 'lubricating capitalism' has eroded," Professor Wiggins said. "It's simply very difficult for young people to believe that they're serving any social purpose now."
Even at top colleges and business schools, where Wall Street was once considered hallowed ground, the focus is shifting. In 2008, the last recruiting year before the financial crisis, 28 percent of the employed seniors in Harvard's graduating class went into finance. Last year, that number fell to 17 percent, as students opted for other fields and investment banks cut their ranks.
Ben Pruden, a second-year student at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin, said on Wednesday that he planned to go into technology, not to Wall Street, after receiving his business degree. He has a job lined up at salesforce.com after graduation, and said that although he knew people working in finance, including his sister, Wall Street held little sway with him.
"I have no interest in working at Goldman," he said. "I want to build something. I don't want to be working in an industry that effectively leeches off other industries."
Mr. Pruden added, "it's not creative enough for me."

HEADLINE: Recession's Toll on Health Coverage

BYLINE: REED ABELSON


HIGHLIGHT: A study finds a sharp drop in employer-sponsored insurance from 2007 to 2010. 

 BODY:
It's a startling reminder that when people lose their jobs, they typically also lose their health insurance coverage. The share of children and working-age adults who had insurance through an employer fell 10 percentage points during the last recession, according to a study released on Thursday by the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.
From 2007 to 2010, the share of children and working-age adults with employer-sponsored coverage fell to 53.5 percent from 63.6 percent, according to the study.
The major contributor to the decline was the loss of employment during the downturn, with almost a third of the people younger than 65 living in a family where no one was working, according to the study. The study is based on the center's 2007 and 2010 Health Tracking Household Surveys.
The surge in unemployment, coupled with the steady deterioration of the number of employers offering coverage and the number of workers signing up for insurance, is causing a "steady erosion" in employer-based coverage, said Chapin White, a senior researcher at the center who is an author of the study.
"There's been a lot of debate about what health reform is going to do to employer-sponsored coverage," he said, but much of that discussion ignores the significant decline in employers as a source of coverage. "The backdrop for that debate is shifting," he said.
The study was conducted for the National Institute for Health Care Reform, a nonprofit group founded by Chrysler, Ford, General Motors and the United Automobile Workers union.

HEADLINE: Better Economic Forecasts, From the Cloud

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: As more companies put information about manufacturing, logistics and payments into the cloud, more real-time economic activity becomes visible. One company that looks at this for 100 big companies can see things faster and clearer than many governments. 

 BODY:
 Someday soon, the Federal Reserve may be dead, at least for economic information. Blame it on, or credit it to, cloud computing.
I recently visited the Oakland, Calif., headquarters of GT Nexus, a company that monitors supply chain information - things like ordering, payment, manufacture and logistics - for 100 major companies. Think of GT Nexus as a Facebook for corporate behavior: business partners are friends, and the completion of tasks are status updates. 
The clients inside this cloud-based system include Home Depot, Sears Holdings, Adidas, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett-Packard and Fiat Industrial. Each giant company typically has about 1,000 other organizations involved in its business, including suppliers and manufacturers, freight companies, customs officials and banks. GT Nexus keeps straight all their goods, services and the payments involved, in real time, on a cloud-based computing platform. It is possible because so many people, things and computers are now connected to the Internet. 
Using a laptop, I saw a $270 pair of Adidas soccer shoes was ordered in the United States on Oct. 25, manufactured in Lianjiang, China, on Dec. 25 at 04:00 Pacific time, and air-freighted to the United States on Jan. 6. I saw 4,941,554 units of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax were sent from Pfizer's Puerto Rico factory to Narita airport in Japan, at a temperature appropriate to keep the drugs safe, ahead of the tsunami anniversary. 
I saw that investors in Mauritius had bought Caterpillar's largest truck, and shipped it (in pieces, to avoid taxes) to South Africa, where it was assembled for final delivery to a mining project in Congo. I zoomed up a level, and looked at thousands of container cargoes as they moved around the planet. 
As thrilling, or geeky, as that may sound, something important is going on. GT Nexus can abstract all the data among all these supply chains into one really big picture, and get a remarkably clear view of all kinds of real-time world activity. 
Its customers have total revenues that amount to $500 billion, about 2 percent of the world's gross domestic product. You can take a number like that and start to extrapolate an overall picture of the economy. In fact, that is exactly what economists at the Federal Reserve and the Commerce Department do, though not quite as slickly, when they crank out those all-important numbers on economic growth and gross domestic product.
Looking at the activity of cargo shipments over several years, we saw flat activity in the recession year of 2009, then an increase (compared with a year earlier) in August 2010. That was from companies ordering goods ahead of the Christmas season, though they waited until the last minute because they were not yet confident that the consumer would shop. In 2011, the activity began as early as May, indicating the big companies felt more confident. 
So far this year, things are above last year's levels, and payments are made relatively quickly, indicating the economy is still doing well.
Take a purchase order, say from J.C. Penney, for clothing by Under Armour; the clothing is manufactured overseas and shipped to the United States. That order, mixed with the orders from many more retailers, provides a snapshot of expectations about how much and what people will buy, 270 days before the products are in stores. Can a government economist do that?
As GT Nexus, and companies like it, build out these kinds of systems, their information becomes more telling about the whole world. "Globalization was instrumental to our growth," says Aaron Sasson, GT Nexus's founder and chief executive, who has spent 13 years and $30 million of the money he and his brother made selling another software company. "China was very popular five years ago. Now customers are moving to Vietnam, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, wherever the costs are lower. We just move the system with them."
Mr. Sasson has not yet made a product from all this data, but sees the possibility. Customers are not used to sharing their information so readily, and he needs to build trust. Recently 45 companies contributed their data in order to figure out the average time a cargo stayed in port. Should they choose to pool all their data, however, they could have one of the most powerful and reliable economic indicators. If they published it, the world would pay attention, even if the companies themselves got, say, a 30-minute lead time on the release of the info. 
It is also possible to merge different databases and model future consumption, a feature that could someday shape corporate and government policy. In one scenario, a shipment from Shenzhen to Chicago was modeled for different pollution outcomes, depending on whether it was sent via the ports of Los Angeles; Tacoma, Wash.; or Norfolk, Va., as well as the total carbon produced by the ship, rail cars and trucks used along the way. In an ideal world, a route through Tacoma, which used a lot of rail in the United States, produced the least carbon. But since many of the rail cars were reserved, another database chimed in, the Tacoma shipment would actually require a lot of dirty trucking. Long Beach, Calif., worked better.
It is not clear that GT Nexus has this market won. As they build out their clouds, companies like SAP and Oracle may be able to deliver similar insights across industries and economies, in something near real time. The greatest challenge may be in teaching their customers to share data, because the computer technology, from sensors at the edge to big servers in the cloud, is already in place.
Often enough, successful technologies change society itself. This kind of cloud-based information is rapidly creating huge pools of data in real time, which can be related to other pools of information like never before.

HEADLINE: Getting Doctors to Think About Costs

BYLINE: PAULINE W. CHEN, M.D.


HIGHLIGHT: An innovative nonprofit group is teaching young doctors about weighing the costs of care when making medical decisions. 

 BODY:
My first formal lesson on health care costs occurred one afternoon on the wards when I was a medical student. The senior doctor in charge, a silver-haired specialist known for his thoughtful approach to patient care, had assembled several students and doctors-in-training to discuss a theoretical patient with belly pain. After describing the patient's history and physical exam, he asked what tests we might order.
One doctor-in-training proposed blood work. A fellow student suggested a urine test. Another classmate asked for abdominal X-rays.
My hand shot up. "A CAT scan," I crowed with confidence. "I'd get a CAT scan!"
There was complete silence. Everyone turned to stare at me.
The senior doctor coughed. "That's an awfully expensive test," he said, a grimace appearing on his face. Another student asked him just how much a CT scan cost, and he shifted uncomfortably in his seat and shrugged. "I don't really know," he said, "but I do know that we can't just think about the patient anymore." He took a deep breath before continuing, "We are now being forced to consider costs."
That was 20 years ago, when the managed care movement was first in the headlines. Today his lesson still rings true, as doctors continue to struggle to reconcile cost consciousness with quality care. And doctors-to-be are not getting much help in learning how to do so.
But one nonprofit organization, Costs of Care, and the young doctor who created it are determined to change that.
Over the last two years, Dr. Neel Shah, a senior resident in obstetrics and gynecology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, has been collaborating with medical educators and health care economists at Harvard Medical School and at the Pritzker School of Medicine at the University of Chicago to create a series of videos and educational materials designed to help medical students and doctors-in-training learn to make clinical decisions that optimize both quality of care and cost. With support from the American Board of Internal Medicine, these educational modules, called the Teaching Value Project, could represent a significant breakthrough in how medical students learn to be conscious of costs.
The patchwork of payment patterns that mark the American medical system makes it particularly difficult to teach young doctors. Net costs for treatments and medications vary depending on region, payer and even specific hospitals, so medical students and trainees often end up learning what is relevant only to their particular workplace. They might learn to prescribe a certain drug for diabetes because it is cheaper in their hospital formulary, only to discover later that the reverse is true in a different hospital or after policies have changed.
"When learning is haphazard like this, it's hard for young doctors to see the entire picture," said Dr. Vineet Arora, an assistant dean at Pritzker who is working on the Teaching Value Project.
Cost variations aside, it can also be a challenge simply to get hold of precise costs for patients. Dr. Shah recalls one woman who refused to get a potentially lifesaving ultrasound until she knew how much it would cost her. Her doctors and nurses "sweated out every minute," concerned she would collapse at any moment, said Dr. Shah, before finally hunting down a figure later that afternoon, and the patient consented to paying the $600 cost.
The Teaching Value Project uses a rough pricing hierarchy rather than exact dollar figures to gauge costs, similar to the approach at well-known restaurant or travel search sites, which helps young doctors avoid getting mired in price variations and hairsplitting details. When combined with the project's lessons on common cost errors that doctors make, the pricing hierarchy can bring clarity to clinical decisions.
For example, a young doctor might plan on ordering an ultrasound of the heart, or an echocardiogram, for an otherwise stable patient in the hospital because the wait for inpatients is shorter. But if that doctor also knows that echocardiograms are much less expensive when administered to outpatients, he or she might instead decide to wait and order it after discharge.
Similarly, a team of trainees might believe they are being cost-conscious by debating whether to get a battery of moderately expensive tests for a patient in the intensive care unit. But then they might learn that the time they are devoting to the debate is actually costing more than the tests themselves because of the expense of keeping the patient in an I.C.U. bed even a few extra hours.
"Zagat has figured it out," Dr. Shah said. "Knowing whether it's one, two or three dollar signs can be enough to influence behavior."
The group recently posted an introductory video, a tongue-in-cheek look at what hotels would be like if they were run like hospitals. At the "Hotel Hpital," prices are never listed; concierges order expensive cabs pre-emptively, or "prophylactically," even if you don't need one; and no one working in the back office can decipher your surprise $20,000 hotel bill.
The group expects to complete its first full Teaching Value module this summer, with more planned over the next few years. It also hopes to collaborate with professional medical organizations to help raise cost consciousness among more established practicing physicians.
All involved are quick to acknowledge that as appealing as the approach may be, the Teaching Value Project represents only a beginning for medical students and trainees. "Our goal isn't for them to master the entire topic before graduating," Dr. Arora said. "It's to get them thinking about how to integrate cost consciousness into practice."
Dr. Shah added: "At the end of the day, what we are talking about is spending our patients' money in a way that is both ethical and pragmatic. To do that, we will all need to create a culture where it becomes awkward to think about cost."
An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the name of the program. It is the Teaching Value Project, not Teach Value Project.

HEADLINE: Six Monks vs. One Warship

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Asia has seen remarkable displays of hard power and soft power in recent days, as the region struggles to come to grips with frozen and seemingly intractable conflicts. There have been war games, the display of China's new aircraft carrier, Vietnamese monks being sent to "occupy" a disputed island and a South Korean-born conductor leading an orchestra with North Korean musicians. So, do six Buddhists trump one warship? 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - Asia has seen varying displays of hard power and soft power in recent days, as the region struggles to come to grips with some frozen and seemingly intractable conflicts.
Hard power, as a concept, is pretty simple - "the use of coercive force to drive change,'' according to the former U.S. homeland security secretary Michael Chertoff. In the carrots-and-stick equation, hard power is the stick. Some recent examples: U.S. troops in Afghanistan, Syrian tanks firing on civilians, sanctions on Iran and North Korea, NATO air strikes against the Libyan regime. 
Political scientists also see the threat (or even the display) of military force as hard power. Live-fire military maneuvers, for example, or border garrisons being placed on alert. Or the shakedown cruises of China's first aircraft carrier, as reported this week by my colleague Michael Wines. 
China has long had carrier lust, and Michael says Beijing's first one is "a 1980s Soviet warship that has been refitted with modern weaponry.'' State-run media in China quoted a top navy official as saying the carrier has been undergoing sea trials since last August. China recently announced an 11.2 percent increase in its defense budget, and as Edward Wong has reported, an expanding Chinese navy has been showing a new reach and confidence. 
The Chinese carrier, formerly called the Varyag, was bought 15 years ago by a businessman with a travel company in Hong Kong. He paid a reported $20 million for the ship - at that point it had no engines - and towed it from a Ukrainian shipyard with the intention of turning the hulk into a floating hotel and casino. 
That was then, and the Varyag never made it to Hong Kong. Instead it has reportedly been rechristened the and added to Beijing's growing naval fleet. (A fascinating Bloomberg account of the ship's saga is here.) 
The presence of the carrier on maneuvers in blue water seems to be a clear, hard-power message to those countries in the region that lay claim to various islands in the South China Sea, notably the Spratly and the Paracel island groups. China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines all have partial (and often overlapping) claims to the area. 
The myriad islands, islets and outcroppings - some of which are so ephemeral that they're submerged at high tide - have long been a source of tension in the region, in large part because they are believed to hold a bonanza of oil and natural gas. 
All the claimant countries except Brunei have established military garrisons on various disputed islands, and China and Vietnam regularly charge each other with the violent harassment of their fishing vessels.
But in a novel use of soft power, Vietnam said earlier this week that six Buddhist monks will soon take up residence on one of the Spratlys. The monks, who reportedly will stay for the next year, belong to the government-sanctioned wing of the Buddhist church. 
It makes for a textbook case of hard power versus soft: Do six monks trump one warship?

Soft power, as a concept, is a "much more fluid matter,'' as Mr. Chertoff said, and a bit harder to define. Sometimes known as public diplomacy, it can involve cultural or student exchanges, economic incentives, foreign aid and the like. 
"By having interpersonal relationships we broaden understanding,'' Mr. Chertoff said.
The originator of the term, the Harvard professor Joseph Nye, outlines the idea here, in a video talk.
The Chinese know a little something about soft power, too. Responding to diplomatic feelers from the Nixon administration in 1971, Mao Zedong's government invited the touring U.S. table tennis team to come to China for a series of matches. 
At the time, such an exchange was nearly unthinkable - until it wasn't. When the Americans accepted the invitation, "ping-pong diplomacy'' was born. 
As The Times notedon April 10, 1971, "Mao Tse-tung is demonstrating that table tennis can be used as a subtle and effective instrument of diplomacy.'' 
The table tennis matches were a forerunner to President Nixon's landmark trip to China in 1972, and the Chinese quickly followed his visit with the donation of two panda bears to the National Zoo in Washington. Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing were a huge success, and "panda diplomacy" remains a valuable item in Beijing's public relations toolbox. 
Another remarkable display of soft power took place Wednesday in Paris, as 90 musicians from the Unhasu Orchestra of North Korea joined the Radio France Philharmonic Orchestra for a concert, Sophie Cohen reportsat the ArtsBeat blog. 
It remains to be seen whether such an intermingling might help calm the fractious relationship between the two Koreas. They remain technically at war, and recent military exercises by the United States and South Korea around the Korean Peninsula have enraged the North.
Myung-whun Chung, the chief conductor of the Seoul Philharmonic, led the joint orchestra in Paris, and he said he had wanted the event to "be presented with no political wrappings: no speeches, no flags flying." (He also spoke with our colleague Daniel Wakin last September about his effort at "baton diplomacy.") 
In a Thursday on Al Jazeera, which includes footage of North Korean players under his baton, Mr. Chung said he originally wanted to combine musicians from North and South Korea.
"But that's politically not possible right now,'' he said. "They consider the situation too politically blocked and too frozen.''

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: The latest political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
In Today's Times:
The Obama campaign is set to put out a 17-minute documentary this morning to kick off its general election push, a move that underscores how, for presidential campaigns, online video is increasingly important to communicate with voters and raise money, Jeremy W. Peters writes.
Puerto Rico got a look at a new Rick Santorum on Wednesday, a day after he won primaries in Alabama and Mississippi. For starters, he wore a dark suit and tie instead of his trademark sweater vest. Katharine Q. Seelye writes that Mr. Santorum has reached a point where he can present himself as a legitimate presidential candidateinstead of a spoiler, despite some missteps, as the contest for the Republican nomination heads to Illinois.
After losing to Mr. Santorum in the Deep South, Mitt Romney headed north to New York and Connecticut to reassure big Republican donors about his candidacy amid worries about his lack of appeal to the party's conservative base, Ashley Parker and Nicholas Confessore write.
It is Mr. Romney's disconnect with conservatives that Newt Gingrich has seized to form his justification for staying in the Republican race despite a long string of losses. Under increasing pressure to leave the race, Mr. Gingrich wants conservatives to believe that he is the person they need to block Mr. Romney's path to the Republican nomination in August, Jim Rutenberg and Jeff Zeleny write.
Senate Democrats are making a push for a vote to renew the Violence Against Women Act. Jonathan Weisman writes Republicans oppose some changes to the law but are keenly aware that blocking the legislation might help Democrats paint them as antiwoman in an election year.
A popular jobs bill is stalled in Congress as a battle brews between Democrats and Republicans over the future of the Export-Import Bank. Annie Lowrey writes that the credit agency is expected to hit its lending ceiling in March and needs to be reauthorized in May, but conservatives are looking to abolish the bank.
Happening in Washington:
Economic data expected today include the producer price index for February and weekly jobless claims, both at 8:30 a.m.
At 10, Robert Mueller, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, will testify before the Senate appropriations committee.
At 10:55, President Obama is scheduled to give a speech about American energy at Prince George's Community College. In the afternoon, he has two meetings scheduled with Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and his senior advisers.
At 12:15 p.m., the Alliance for Health Reform will hold a briefing at the National Press Club on the constitutional challenges to the 2010 health care overhaul.

HEADLINE: What Threatens Peace in India's Northeast?

BYLINE: SAMRAT


HIGHLIGHT: Ethnic battles and environmental issues could disrupt the region's path to peace. 

 BODY:

For India's Northeast to have a bright future, the region will need to avoid a few minefields.
Most importantly, "a sustainable peace, including in the Kachin state (in Myanmar), is essential for all this to happen," wrote Thant Myint-U, the author of "Where India Meets China," in a message. 
This peace, and the subsequent the reopening of road links, and the Trans-Asian Railway - which seeks to connect India to Myanmar - could be held up in the Naga inhabited areas because of disputes among the Naga, Kuki and Meitei ethnic groups over control of the hill tracts of Manipur. Forming a crucial link that would connect India to the economies of Southeast Asia and China ultimately depends on the calming of several ethnic battles.
Roads through Manipur are frequently blockaded for months over the issue. Elections for the Manipur state assembly provided a break in the usual routine of ethnic animosities, but those could erupt again at any time.
In addition, the larger region could find itself in turmoil over environmental issues sparked by an attempt to build 168 big dams here. Popular protest movements have already gathered steam over these dams, which many people fear will lead to loss of their land and livelihoods. There are also fears of earthquakes leading to dam ruptures in this region.
Answering local residents' concerns about the dams is essential to lasting peace, said Sanjib Baruah, a professor of political studies at Bard College in New York and author of "India Against Itself,'' a book about conflict in the region.
Mr. Baruah recently spent several weeks in Assam, where he traveled with hopes that "we may indeed be able to soon talk about post-conflict/post ULFA Assam," he said in a recent interview by e-mail. (ULFA, the United Liberation Front of Assam, is the major insurgent group that has been fighting for the state's independence from India since 1979.) "But after traveling to Lakhimpur-Dhemaji, seeing the anti-dam protests, and reading the Assamese press, I am no longer sure," he said.
"The hydropower dams under construction, or on the drawing board in Arunachal Pradesh, appear to be an enormous source of anxiety in Assam," he said. Moreover, the hydropower is meant almost entirely for use elsewhere, at least for the moment.
"The region is being groomed to play a familiar role: that of a resource frontier - supplier of natural resources to fuel the engines of economic growth elsewhere," he said. It is a role that breeds insurgency and anti-state protests.
"My tentative formulation is that the politics of identity is slowly giving way to a politics of anxiety," said Mr. Baruah. Political parties and insurgent groups in the region have long championed rights of particular ethnic groups. The protests against the dams, though, have united ethnic and religious groups as they face shared fears.
"Delhi's commitment to developing Arunachal's hydropower potential is huge - there are even strategic considerations," he said. "There is a notion among Indian decision-makers that we have to build dams in the Siang before China does. They seem to believe that international law on water is fairly solid, and that there is a 'use it or lose it' principle because of which we have to beat China to it."
He doesn't see any easy way of all this sorting out.
Another fear about the recent weakening of local insurgent groups is that Maoists, identified as India's biggest internal security threat by prime minister Manmohan Singh, will extend their operations to Northeast India. "There are already indications that the Communist Party of India-Maoist is trying to occupy the spaces vacated by the insurgent groups that have lost traction," said Ajai Sahni, the head of South Asia Terrorism Portal, a security think tank in Delhi. "Demographic trends, including significant increases in population, pressures of migration, and frictions between divergent ethnic formations, add to the conflict potential of the region. Environmental and resource challenges can exacerbate the situation further."
Almost every one of the seven states in the Northeast has experienced a higher population growth than in India as a whole. Local residents tend to blame migration from Bangladesh and Nepal, though large families are common in the region. Good governance could prevent conflict, said Mr. Sahni, but given the quality of governance the region has experienced, there is reason to worry.
Indian officials have also expressed concerns that China may be providing support for insurgent groups in the region. Paresh Barua, the military chief of the ULFA, is said to be under Chinese protection somewhere near Ruili on China's border with Myanmar.
The National Socialist Council of Nagaland's Isak-Muivah faction, the most powerful insurgent group in Northeast India, has also re-established contact with China, Home Secretary G.K. Pillai said in February.
China has denied all this, saying in a statement on Feb. 16 that it follows a policy of not interfering in the affairs of other countries.
If the leader of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah), Th. Muivah, 76, dies or retires without a settlement being reached, the group, which has rearmed during the 14 years since the cease-fire, could go back to war under a new leadership, a Naga activist with links to the group, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in an interview last month.
Across the border in Myanmar, cease-fires with the ethnic armies are tenuous where they exist. Any settlement would have to give political autonomy and control over local resources to the ethnic groups. That is, if the Burman majority don't fall out among themselves.
Both India and China stand to gain greatly from peace and progress in these parts. China's relatively underdeveloped Yunnan province, where about 40 percent of the population belongs to ethnic minorities, borders Myanmar on one side. India's relatively underdeveloped Northeast, with its mainly tribal states, is on the other.
Trade between the two countries has been rising, and hit an all time high of $73.9 billion in 2011. There is, however, a big trade deficit of $27 billion in China's favor.
The two giants of Asia will come closer as flights, roads and rail links connect both to Myanmar. Whatever happens next will determine the destinies of close to half the world's population.

 BODY:
Public Rebuke of Culture at Goldman Opens Debate | Until early Wednesday morning, Greg Smith was a largely anonymous 33-year-old midlevel executive at Goldman Sachs in London.
Now everyone at the firm -- and on Wall Street -- knows his name. Mr. Smith resigned in an e-mail message to his bosses at 6:40 a.m. London time, laying out concerns that Goldman's culture had gone haywire, putting its own interests ahead of its clients.
What the e-mail did not say was that about 15 minutes later, an Op-Ed article he had written detailing his criticisms was to be published in The New York Times.
The article reignited a debate on the Internet and on cable television over whether Wall Street was corrupted by greed and excess. By noon, television crews crowded outside Goldman's headquarters in Lower Manhattan. More than three years after the financial crisis, the perception that little has changed on Wall Street -- and that no one has been held accountable for the risk-taking that led to the crisis -- looms large in the public consciousness. While it was an unusual cry from the heart of a Wall Street insider, many questioned whether it would prompt any change.
Although he is not highly paid by Wall Street standards -- earning about $500,000 last year, according to people briefed on the matter -- Mr. Smith is part of what some Goldman staff members and alumni refer to as a sizable, yet silent, contingent within the investment bank. These people are increasingly frustrated with what they see as a shift in recent years to a profit-above-all mentality. DealBook

HEADLINE: Good Jobs and Bad Jobs

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Why we need a new labor movement. 

 BODY:
Often missing in the jobs, jobs, jobs conversation-John Boehner's promise to focus on jobs, the fight over whether Democrats or Republicans are responsible for the lack of jobs, the paeans to private-sector job-creators, the denigration of public-sector job-creators-is that some jobs are better than others.
Which is why the decline in the jobless rate, from 9.1 percent last summer to 8.3 percent in February, is cause for only modest celebration.

As we wrote in one of our Wednesday editorials, "at least 40 percent of the new private sector jobs fall into low-paying categories." People are finding work at bars and restaurants and in retail. By and large they're not getting hired as teachers, librarians or road workers (better-paid, more secure positions.)
Something we didn't mention in the editorial is how the good job/bad job divide is affecting the young. An article in the spring issue of Good magazine notes that nearly half of people in the 16 to 29 age bracket don't have a job, and that a quarter of those who do work in the hospitality industry. The article also points to a study of 4 million Facebook profiles (I grant that it probably wouldn't stand up to peer review as a scientific sampling), which found that "after the military, the top four employers listed by twenty-somethings were Walmart, Starbucks, Target, and Best Buy." Those are often part-time jobs, and they're not stable. They certainly don't provide entry to the middle class.
There's no easy solution to this problem. At least I haven't heard one. Some of our representatives in Washington think a manufacturing revival will take place just as soon as we slash taxes on the rich even further. That sounds like a fairy tale to me. And, as Christine Romer, formerly a senior economic adviser to the president, wrote in The Times recently, the "pay premium for low-skilled workers in manufacturing is smaller than it once was" due to increased international competition. The government could also create decent jobs by putting money into public works projects (and there's pretty much always need for things like highway maintenance so this wouldn't necessarily be a short-term solution). But federal spending is anathema to the right, so that doesn't seem likely to happen either.
Or, instead of trying to re-create the 20th century economy, we could work with what we have-meaning we could work to improve the lot of service-industry personnel - or even better allow them to help themselves. A job at a Michigan car factory is not better than a job at a clothing store or a restaurant; it's more desirable because it pays better, and it pays better because a few generations ago the Detroit labor force unionized. A job at Walmart with a pension upon retirement doesn't sound too bad. It could happen through collective bargaining.
In other words, let's not try to recreate the 20th century economy. Let's just allow a 20th century labor movement to thrive in the 21st.

HEADLINE: In Toledo, Biden Makes a Working-Class Appeal

BYLINE: MARK LEIBOVICH


HIGHLIGHT: The vice president criticized the Republican presidential candidates by name - repeatedly - accusing them of being "about protecting the privileged sector." 

 BODY:
9:28 p.m. | Updated A revised version of this post is available here.
TOLEDO, Ohio -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Obama administration's go-to emissary to the Rust Belt, waded into his political sweet zone on Thursday, promoting the White House's economic record to a raucous gathering at the United Auto Workers Local 12 hall. He talked up the American auto industry, praised the president's spine and criticized the Republican presidential candidates by name - repeatedly - accusing them of being "about protecting the privileged sector."
"I am laying out a clear and stark difference between us and our opponents," Mr. Biden said before a supportive crowd of about 500, many of them employees of Jeep, one of this city's biggest employers.
Mr. Biden's drop-in to this electorally vital state was billed by the president's re-election enterprise as a first salvo of sorts in a more formal phase of the campaign. While the re-election effort ostensibly started months ago -- with both Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden appearing at fund-raisers and campaignlike events -- the White House called the vice president's visit here the first official event of the campaign. Mr. Obama was speaking at the same time in Maryland, defending his energy policies at a rally.
It had all the trappings - 2012 signs (with the zero forming the iconic Obama "O"), campaign buttons, local supporters, a lectern decked out in a big flag and an "economy built to last" placard at the dais.
Mr. Biden's rhetoric was also more nakedly campaign-oriented than typically vice presidential. It included explicit denunciations of some of the remaining Republican candidates, Rick Santorum, the former senator of Pennsylvania, Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, and - particularly - Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, whom the White House still views as its most likely challenger in the fall, despite Mr. Romney's losses to Mr. Santorum in two Southern primaries this week.
"The verdict is in," Mr. Biden said. "President Obama was right, and they were dead wrong."
For months, Republicans have portrayed the administration as a Big Daddy of bailouts, handouts and entitlements. Speaking here in Toledo, 60 miles from Detroit and the home of a large Jeep plant, Mr. Biden said the administration's decision to support the embattled American auto industry in 2009 was correct, despite hard opposition from many Republicans - namely Mr. Romney, who suggested that Detroit might have been better off had it been left alone, a position Mr. Biden was quick to remind everyone.
He brought up a comment by Mr. Romney that help from the federal government would be worse than bankruptcy for General Motors, that it would turn the company into "the living dead." When Mr. Biden repeated that line, to a cascade of boos, he then added that the resurgent auto sector provided living proof that the administration's actions were correct.
He continued, deriding Republicans as not only being against government help for the auto industry, but also their belief that the private sector would have filled the void instead.
"In 2009, nobody was lining up to lend money to General Motors, or lend money to anyone," Mr. Biden said. "That includes Bain Capital," he added, a crack at the private equity firm where Mr. Romney spent his formative professional years.
The appearance on Thursday mirrored many of the same forays Mr. Biden made into a region that essentially became his second home in the fall of 2008. Toledo was the first of what are expected to be four cities that the vice president will visit in crucial states over the next month. He is expected to visit Florida next week, another destination that will likely be familiar turf for Mr. Biden, who has a long history of support from the state's heavy Jewish population, some of whom have been wary of the administration's commitment to Israel.
In a sense, Mr. Biden's speech represented a straight-ahead campaign rebuttal to the barrage of attacks that the president has endured from Republican presidential candidates in a primary campaign that shows no sign of abating.

HEADLINE: Cost of Long-Term Care Insurance Keeps Rising

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The cost of long-term care insurance continues to rise. 

 BODY:
There just hasn't been a lot of good news about long-term care insurance lately. Private insurers have been dropping the product, and the Obama administration announced last fall that it was scrapping plans for a federally sponsored option.
The latest? The American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance says its yearly analysis of popular policies offered by 10 big insurers finds that prices for such policies have risen by as much as 17 percent from a year ago.
The average annual cost for a single 55-year-old in good health is $1,720, for $165,000 to $200,000 of current coverage, the association says. Last year, the same coverage would have cost $1,480.
The analysis priced policies that included a 3 percent compound inflation growth factor, because consumers need to be sure the benefits they buy today keep pace with rising costs, said Jesse Slome, the association's executive director.
Mr. Slome attributed the premium increases to continued low interest rates and middling yields on fixed-income investments, which make it difficult for insurers to earn enough from investing the premiums they collect to pay future claims. "It's the cumulative impact - and looking ahead," he said, noting that the Federal Reserve has indicated that interest rates will not rise much through 2014.
Mr. Slome said that insurance companies were pricing their products correctly. "The problem is, it's an expensive product," he said.
The cost of the premiums offered by different companies for comparable coverage varied widely, though, so comparison shopping is important, Mr. Slome said.
Roughly eight million people carry some kind of long-term care coverage, according to the association's data.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Tangles With Obama on Gas Prices

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Newt Gingrich used a campaign rally to respond to President Obama's charge earlier in the day that Republicans were pandering to voters by promising lower gas prices. 

 BODY:
Newt Gingrich used a campaign rally on Thursday afternoon to respond to President Obama's charge earlier in the day that Republicans were pandering to voters by promising lower gas prices.
Mr. Obama compared the presidential candidates to members of the Flat Earth Society for dismissing alternative energy sources like solar and biofuels and emphasizing only versions of "drill, baby, drill.''
The president did not name anyone, but Mr. Gingrich had no doubt that it was him in the cross hairs, since he has repeatedly mocked Mr. Obama as "President Algae" for extolling biofuels.
"The president maligned me, suggesting I don't like biofuels," Mr. Gingrich said at a rally in Illinois, which holds its primary on Tuesday and where, he noted, he drove past a station selling gas for $4.59 a gallon. "That's baloney. I am in favor of science and technology."
But he argued that "no serious study" showed that algae could replace a significant amount of oil in the short run. He announced that his campaign would make coffee mugs and mouse pads comparing his promise of $2.50-a-gallon gas with a $10-a-gallon projected price under the president's policies. It will be a winning issue for Republicans, Mr. Gingrich said, if he becomes the nominee. 
Mr. Gingrich has made the promise of cheaper gas through aggressive drilling nearly the sole focus of his campaign lately, though he is not alone. Rick Santorum taps a piece of oil shale during stump speeches while attacking Mr. Obama for opposing the drilling technology called fracking. And last month, the speaker of the House, John A. Boehner, told Republican colleagues that the soaring price of gas was a political issue they should exploit.
The White House is clearly concerned about the potential for higher gas prices to undermine the economic recovery and Mr. Obama's re-election chances, and the president has given a series of energy speeches in recent weeks to show his concern.
Energy Secretary Steven Chu backed down this week from a controversial comment he made in 2008, when he said the best way to encourage conservation would be an increase in gas prices in the United States to the levels seen in Europe.
"Of course we don't want the price of gasoline to go up, we want it to go down," Dr. Chu said at a Senate hearing on Tuesday.
Mr. Gingrich accused Dr. Chu of election-year pandering of his own. "Dr. Chu's turnaround is entirely a function of the election, and the day after the election he'll be right back" to his earlier position, he said in Illinois.
Mr. Obama, addressing students at a community college in Largo, Md., in a speech that had all the flavor of campaign oratory, said Republicans were making blue-sky promises.
"Every time prices start to go up, especially in an election year, politicians dust off their three-point plans for $2 gas," he said. "They head down to the gas station, they make sure a few cameras are following them and then they start acting like, 'We've got a magic wand, and we will give you cheap gas forever if you just elect us,' every time. Been the same script for 30 years. It's like a bad rerun."
Mr. Obama's solution to rising gas prices is fundamentally the opposite of Mr. Gingrich's. The president wants to decrease dependence on fossil fuels through conservation and alternative energy sources. Mr. Gingrich promises that dramatically increasing oil drilling will produce a gusher of nearly miraculous potential: enough energy to cut prices nearly in half, end America's political obligations to Middle East producers and yield $16 trillion to $18 trillion in royalties to pay off the national debt.
"That's what visionary leadership is all about,'' Mr. Gingrich said.
An earlier version of this post misattributed the statement "That's what visionary leadership is all about'' to President Obama.

HEADLINE: Carlyle Expands Board and Reports 2011 Profit

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Carlyle Group disclosed on Thursday that it had filled out its board with seven new members, and that it earned a healthy profit last year, as it prepares to go public within the next few months. 

 BODY:
The Carlyle Group disclosed on Thursday that it had filled out its board with seven new members, and that it earned a healthy profit last year, as the private equity giant prepares to go public within the next few months.
In its latest step toward becoming a full public company, Carlyle added a number of outsider director nominees, according to an amended prospectus.
Among them are Jay S. Fishman, the chief executive of the Travelers Companies; Thomas S. Robertson, dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School; and Janet Hill, a former consultant and the mother of the pro basketball player Grant Hill. Carlyle also installed two of its own executives to its board, James H. Hance Jr. and Edward J. Mathias, joining the firm's senior management.
The private equity firm also disclosed its full financial results for 2011, noting that it earned nearly $1.4 billion in net income on $2.9 billion in revenue. Using economic net income, a pro forma benchmark favored by private equity firms because it excludes some accounting charges, Carlyle earned $833.1 million last year, down 18 percent from 2010.
And using distributable earnings, another nonstandard measure that strips out unrealized gains from economic net income, the firm earned $864.4 million, more than doubling what it booked in 2010. It disclosed distributing $18.8 billion to its partners last year.
Carlyle also reported managing $147 billion in assets by year's end, down slightly from the third quarter.
Carlyle also added 18 new banks to its underwriting group, joining JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Credit Suisse.
The firm's full list of directors is below:

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Appears Poised to Win Appeal in Citigroup Settlement

BYLINE: EDWARD WYATT


HIGHLIGHT: A federal appeals court said that the agency was likely to succeed in its effort to overturn Judge Jed S. Rakoff's rejection of the commission's fraud settlement with Citigroup over the sale of mortgage-related investments. 

 BODY:
6:15 p.m. | Updated 
WASHINGTON - A federal appeals court dealt a stinging rebuke on Thursday to Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in New York, who last year rejected a Securities and Exchange Commission fraud settlement with Citigroup because the deal had allowed the company to avoid admitting any wrongdoing.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, in a mostly procedural decision, ruled that the S.E.C. was likely to succeed in a full-blown appeal of Judge Rakoff's rejection of the commission's proposed $285 million settlement with Citigroup. The case centered on the bank's structuring and sale of mortgage-related investments prior to the financial crisis.
Judge Rakoff has been critical of the S.E.C. in other decisions and has held up other tentative settlements that the S.E.C. had reached in recent years, including one with Bank of America over bonuses paid at its Merrill Lynch unit.
But the latest decision by the appeals court is significant for the S.E.C. as well as scores of other federal regulatory agencies, which have warned that if companies are forced to admit guilt in settling cases with regulators, enforcement actions would grind to a halt. 
In an unsigned but unanimous decision, a three-judge appeals panel agreed. "Requiring such an admission would in most cases undermine any chance for compromise," the court said. 
The appeals court ruling puts off a trial between the S.E.C. and Citigroup that Judge Rakoff had scheduled for July. He did so after concluding that because the settlement failed to include any agreed-upon facts, the court was unable to judge whether the outcome was fair, adequate reasonable or in the public interest. 
But the appeals court panel dismantled Judge Rakoff's logic and analysis, saying he had overstepped his judicial authority in rejecting an settlement by an agency of the executive branch. "We have no reason to doubt the S.E.C.'s representation that the settlement it reached is in the public interest," the court said.
While noting that its opinion on the procedural points is not binding on a panel that will judge the merits of Judge Rakoff's arguments, the court nevertheless said, "We are satisfied that the S.E.C. and Citigroup have made a strong showing of likelihood of success in setting aside the district court's rejection of their settlement."
A different panel of appellate judges for the Second Circuit will hear arguments later this year on whether to overturn Judge Rakoff's rejection of the proposed settlement. A court-appointed lawyer will argue Judge Rakoff's point of view.
Judge Rakoff, who is sitting on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit bench this week hearing cases, as district court judges often do, declined to comment because the case was still in court. 
Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C.'s enforcement director, said the agency was pleased with the decision. "As we have said consistently, we agree to settlements when the terms reflect what we reasonably believe we could obtain if we prevailed at trial, without the risk of delay and uncertainty that comes with litigation," Mr. Khuzami said in a statement. "Equally important, this settlement approach preserves resources that we can use to stop other frauds and protect other victims." 
Citigroup, which sided with the S.E.C. against Judge Rakoff, also issued a statement saying it was pleased with the ruling.
Thomas O. Gorman, a law partner at Dorsey and Whitney in Washington and author of the blog S.E.C. Actions, called the ruling "an important win for the S.E.C." and one that "is somewhat harsh to Judge Rakoff." 
The appeals court's ruling "is saying that the District Court has a role in the settlement process but it is very, very limited," Mr. Gorman explained. "It makes it relatively clear that the court sees Judge Rakoff as second-guessing the S.E.C., and says that's not appropriate."
The appeals court noted that Judge Rakoff's opinion prejudged the assertion that Citigroup misled investors, assumed that the S.E.C. would win a trial and discounted the possibility that Citigroup would refuse to settle the case if it had to admit liability.
Judge Rakoff's decision "does not appear to have given deference to the S.E.C.'s judgment on wholly discretionary matters of policy," the appeals court said. "It is not, however, the proper function of federal courts to dictate policy to executive administrative agencies."
The unsigned opinion in the case, S.E.C. v. Citigroup Global Markets, came from Judges John M. Walker Jr., Pierre N. Leval and Rosemary S. Pooler. 
Judge Rakoff's decision in the Citigroup case, released in November, created a stir in legal circles and made the judge a folk hero among consumer-advocacy groups. Federal judges in Brooklyn and Wisconsin cited the opinion in other cases involving the S.E.C., requesting additional information from the agency about its allegations before considering proposed settlements.
A federal judge in New Jersey also recently cited Judge Rakoff when considering a settlement proposed by the Federal Trade Commission.
Part of Judge Rakoff's decision focused on whether the settlement was serious enough to serve as a deterrent to repeated violations of the same securities laws. The multimillion dollar civil penalty agreed to by Citigroup was little more than "pocket change" for the company, Judge Rakoff said, and gained the S.E.C. nothing more from the settlement than "a quick headline."
Judge Rakoff also noted that the S.E.C. had not enforced the court injunction it was seeking - a ban on future violations of the same securities law - on any Wall Street firm in at least 10 years.
But the appeals court said: "There is no indication in the record that the court in fact gave deference to the S.E.C.'s judgment on any of these questions." While that does not mean that a court must "rubber stamp" all settlements made by a federal agency, "it does mean that a court should not reject the agency's assessment without substantial reason for doing so."

HEADLINE: Embracing Irish Music, A New York Tradition

BYLINE: By ANDY WEBSTER

 BODY:
YOU step into the crowded establishment, and it hits you: a rousing set of reels, played by a pickup band in the corner. There's a fiddle, a guitar, a bodhran, a concertina, maybe a banjo or a flute or a tin whistle. Your foot starts tapping, you order a pint and you settle in for music summoning images of a damp, windswept isle across the Atlantic. But this isn't St. Patrick's Day. It's the Landmark Tavern, on 11th Avenue in Manhattan, on almost any Monday evening.
All year New York abounds in places to hear traditional Irish music; you can find a session (or seisun, in Gaelic) practically every night. Most are instrumental. A regular group -- the banjoist and fiddler Don Meade leads the Landmark's -- gathers, and other musicians drop in to learn a new reel, jig, hornpipe or air. At a more rollicking engagement the audience might sing along to, oh, ''Whiskey in the Jar.'' And sometimes a reverent hush descends as someone sings solo in unaccompanied sean-nos (old-style) songs. But everywhere the Irish tradition of conviviality prevails. And you avoid yahoos who forget their limits every March 17. 
A tour of Manhattan's hot spots (there are too many in Yonkers and the boroughs, especially Queens, to mention here) might begin on a Sunday night with the 11th Street Bar's session in the East Village. Led by the fiddler Tony DeMarco, it starts at around 9:30 and has long attracted touring professionals seeking a bit of craic (Gaelic for merriment, pronounced ''crack'').
The Landmark's session, on Monday nights, starts around 8. Swift Hibernian Lounge, on Fourth Street in the East Village, hosts one on Tuesdays, as does Dempsey's, a block or two east. Paddy Reilly's Music Bar, on Second Avenue in Murray Hill, offers music and step dancing on Thursdays. Glucksman Ireland House, New York University's center for Irish studies, has monthly Friday performances. On Saturdays, O'Neill's on Third Avenue in Midtown is hopping.
All this persists years after Ireland's glorious 1990s cultural moment in America, when ''Riverdance'' conquered concert halls, ''Angela's Ashes'' dominated best-seller lists, ''In the Name of the Father'' earned Oscar nominations, and the Good Friday Agreement appeared to herald a new era in Northern Ireland. But in the world-changing wake of Sept. 11, Ireland's ascendancy was somehow dimmed.
Or was it? Vogue is temporary; culture is timeless. And Irish traditional music endures, waxing and waning but never disappearing. In Ireland ''traditional music reached a low point in the early '50s,'' said Mr. Meade, who covered the scene for years in a column in The Irish Voice, a weekly newspaper based in New York. Its decline in popularity, he added, could ''be explained by people's desire to turn their backs on rural poverty and embrace the modern world.'' Many were ''ashamed of this very Irish, very rural tradition.''
Mr. Meade cited Irish groups of the 1960s folk revival, the Clancy Brothers and the Dubliners, for reinvigorating the form. The Dubliners' ''combination of traditional dance music and guitar-backed ballads,'' he said, ''was the template for every popular traditional music band that came after them: Planxty and the Bothy Band in the 1970s, Altan, say, in the 1980s.''
As for whether Ireland's cultural hegemony has receded substantially in America in recent years -- exacerbated by the republic's economic tailspin -- Aidan Connolly is not so sure. He is the executive director of the Irish Arts Center on West 51st Street, a locus of theater, music and Gaelic since 1972.
''I don't think I'd agree that it's receded,'' he said in a phone interview. He mentioned Terry George, the Belfast native who wrote and directed ''Hotel Rwanda'' and won an Oscar last month for his live-action short ''The Shore,'' as an example of Ireland's continuing influence and ''the enduring relevance of bands like U2.''
He acknowledged Ireland's present economic struggles but said that optimism ''could just be in the DNA of Ireland, as a country that has endured difficult times.''
''And, you know,'' he added, ''we've gotten by on poetry before.''
One sign of an Irish resurgence in New York is a new Irish Arts Center, scheduled to open in 2016 with private, city and Irish government financing. Embracing multiple disciplines, it bodes well for the future of Ireland's place in New York's cultural life.
But don't ever count out the humble traditional session at the corner pub. It's going to be around for a long, long time.
The Craic, Night by Night: Places in Manhattan to check out live (and mostly free) traditional Irish music throughout the year. (Queens and Brooklyn have plenty as well -- too many to list here.)

HEADLINE: 19th-Century Fern Fever, In England and Beyond

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
LONDON -- Last month the historian Sarah Whittingham nearly tripped over a rope blocking access to a Victorian house museum parlor here. ''I'm so drawn to it,'' she said, referring to the room's bay window, an 1870s protruding glass case originally meant for sheltering ferns.
A staff member at the brick town house, 18 Stafford Terrace in the Kensington neighborhood, let Ms. Whittingham step over the rope, and she wound past the overstuffed furniture to study the window closely. The interior looks much as it did when the home's owner, the cartoonist and photographer Linley Sambourne, lived there.
Ms. Whittingham, the author of the new book ''Fern Fever: The Story of Pteridomania'' (Frances Lincoln), explained that Sambourne's wife, Marion, recorded in her diaries how often she ''did fern cases.'' 
Windows on three floors of the house still bulge with aquariumlike protruding cases, where temperamental ferns were supposed to grow. (Their spots are now mostly occupied by nonfern greenery.) Hardly any other buildings in the world retain their traces of this late-19th-century craze, but Ms. Whittingham's book explains how it was widely promoted as a way to enrich colonial economies, amuse the masses and soothe the insane.
Ms. Whittingham, a largely failed fern grower herself, started researching the topic in 1997, after stumbling on restored Victorian greenhouses stocked with ferns in Scotland. At the height of the fashion, in the 1870s, Britons imported the plants from Tasmania, the Philippines, Borneo and Brazil, among other places. Acquiring specimens in the wild could be hazardous; in 1867 a young woman fell off a Scottish cliff and died after reaching too far for a fern.
Despite the dangers, British aristocrats insisted that the hobby suited the poor and people with mental illness. ''Such study must exercise an ennobling and purifying effect on the human soul,'' a botanist wrote in 1866.
Ms. Whittingham, after the Sambourne house tour, pointed to her book's early-1900s photo of fern cases wedged into hallway windows at an asylum in London.
''If you were suffering from fern fever madness, you'd be in heaven,'' she said wryly. The text points out that the firmly fixed terrariums also kept deranged patients from leaping outside.
This rarefied botanical pursuit is usually considered a British eccentricity, but Ms. Whittingham has turned up much proof that it reached American shores. The New York botanist Frances Theodora Parsons wrote an influential 1899 study, ''How to Know the Ferns,'' and public and private greenhouse ferneries were established in Philadelphia, Detroit and Chicago, among other cities.
Ms. Whittingham's study showcases her own collection of Victorian fern-pattern antiques, including greeting cards, trinket boxes and a cast-iron fire grate. The material turns up widely in stores and online, now that her eye is attuned to the plants' feathery edges and spiral buds.
She racked up 400 footnotes for her 256 pages and, she said, ''I could have done a book twice the size.''
FRY GLASS FOR SALE
Henry Clay Fry operated a glass factory in Rochester, Pa., near the Ohio border, employing 1,000 people for the high-tech and luxury markets. Between 1901 and 1933, Fry offered pieces like laboratory beakers and headlight lenses, as well as fussy, cut-glass hatpin boxes; gold-trimmed sherbet goblets; and opalescent lampshades that rivaled the better-known wares of his competitors at Steuben.
''If there was a buck to be made, he knew how to do it,'' said Dr. Clifton Dietz, a dentist and collector who has helped run a fan club in western Pennsylvania, the H. C. Fry Glass Society.
Fry connoisseurs mostly live near the former factory, which had its own railroad spur and lavish gardens. The collecting group was long mentored by John A. and Dorothy Jordan, retirees who acquired Fry wares and wrote about them for three decades. Hundreds of pieces from their estate will be auctioned next Friday at Jeffrey S. Evans & Associates in Mount Crawford, Va., with estimates mostly of a few hundred dollars each.
The Jordans' daughter, Kathleen Hayden, has kept hundreds more Fry products, some with delicate floral etchings and rare blue hues. ''This was too much a part of our lives'' to sell everything at once, she said in a recent phone interview.
Her parents researched their collection partly by digging through glass shards still piled behind the former Fry factory. The company's molds and archives were apparently scrapped when the Great Depression drove it out of business, but excavations at the dump have yielded evidence of the colors and forms produced there.
''That's been a great asset to us,'' said Mike Sabo, the president of the Fry Society.
The Jordans had hoped to donate their pieces to a Fry museum that has not yet been realized. A few institutions keep Fry glass on view, including a coffee percolator and a cut-glass Liberty Bell at the Corning Museum of Glass, and a popcorn popper and fish hatchery jars at the Senator John Heinz History Center in Pittsburgh. On May 5 the new Beaver County Industrial Museum will open in Darlington, near Rochester, and a gallery there with 40 Fry pieces is in the works.
BLADE OF GLORY
A New York militiaman's 1850 parade sword, worn with his upper-class regiment's uniform of brass-buttoned red coat and white pants, sold for $81,000 (10 times the high estimate) last month at Capo Auction in Queens. The buyer, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, will put it on view this fall with a handful of American ceremonial swords in the Arms and Armor galleries.
''This was an idea of building on a very small foundation, adding another fine piece to the collection,'' said Stuart W. Pyhrr, the Met curator who bid at Capo. On the sword handle a gilded female warrior holds a wreath and shield, and the scabbard bears the name of the original owner, the Manhattan hotel tycoon Richard French. Mr. Pyhrr recognized that an almost identical weapon, made for President Franklin Pierce, belongs to the New Hampshire Historical Society in Concord. (Pierce's sword is on view there through July 7.)
The auction consignors, Irene Math and her mother, Catherine Math, inherited it from an aunt. No one knows how it ended up in an umbrella stand at the aunt's Manhattan apartment, although the owner did have various in-laws interested in blades, including a champion fencer and an American admiral.
The Maths had shown the weapon to larger auction houses, but only the Capo staff members saw its sales potential. When it was unwrapped at the Queens office, Irene Math said, ''They were petting the sword like it was a baby.''

HEADLINE: Weekly Jobless Claims Fall as Producer Prices Increase

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Economic growth showed signs of becoming more robust as the number of Americans claiming new jobless benefits fell to a four-year low last week and manufacturing activity in the Northeast picked up this month, according to reports released Thursday. 
But the effect of higher oil prices was also starting to be seen. Producer prices racked up their biggest increase in five months in February, while manufacturers in New York State reported a surge in input costs in March.
The recent gains in oil and gasoline prices have raised concerns that the higher costs could start to squeeze businesses and consumers and slow the recovery.
Still, producer prices last month did not rise as much as economists had expected, and underlying inflation pressures were contained.
Thursday's initial claims data for state unemployment benefits was further evidence of an improving labor market after the jobless rate held at a three-year low of 8.3 percent in February.
''This suggests that the recovery is firmly on track,'' said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.
The Federal Reserve this week acknowledged the recent improvement in the labor market, but remained concerned with the high unemployment rate.
Initial claims dropped 14,000 to a seasonally adjusted 351,000 last week, the Labor Department said, taking claims back to a four-year low reached in February.
The four-week moving average for new jobless claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends, was unchanged at 355,750.
The firming tone in the job market was reinforced by the manufacturing surveys, which showed that factories increased employment this month.
The New York Federal Reserve said its Empire State general business conditions index rose to 20.21, its highest level since June 2010, from 19.53 in February.
But the components were more mixed, with new orders easing and prices paid having their biggest monthly jump in about six years.
That was in contrast to a report on factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region, where prices paid rose more slowly in March than in February. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's business activity index showed that manufacturing also continued to grow in the region, rising to 12.5 from 10.2.
Thursday's reports were the latest to indicate the economy was holding its own, even though the rate of growth was expected to slow this quarter from the fourth quarter's 3 percent annualized clip.
In a second report, the Labor Department said its seasonally adjusted Producer Price Index increased 0.4 percent last month, quickening from January's 0.1 percent gain, though shy of expectations for a 0.5 percent gain.
Wholesale prices, excluding the volatile food and energy costs, rose 0.2 percent, moderating from January's 0.4 percent increase. While that was in line with economists' expectations, it was the third consecutive month of increases in the core producer price index.
Overall producer prices were lifted by a 1.3 percent increase in energy prices after a 0.5 percent drop in January. Food prices decreased 0.1 percent after falling 0.3 percent in the previous month.

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.
Museums
- The Cloisters: 'The Game of Kings: Medieval Ivory Chessmen From the Isle of Lewis' (through April 22) In 1831, a farmer on the Isle of Lewis, the largest island of the Outer Hebrides, discovered a lost cache of medieval chess pieces. Today, thanks to ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in which Harry and Ron play with magically animated replicas of them, the Lewis Chessmen are world famous. On tour from the British Museum, these adorable, bug-eyed little kings, queens, bishops, knights and warders, each beautifully carved from walrus ivory, are wonderful to examine up close. You don't have to be a chess player or a Harry Potter fan to love them. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
- Frick Collection: 'Renoir, Impressionism and Full-Length Painting' (through May 13) Impressionism, like fashion, is dedicated to the fleeting sensation: this moment's light, this season's dress. Yet the works in this show, which transforms the mohair-upholstered East Gallery into a runway for Renoir's soigne Parisians, don't at first register as Impressionist. With their traditional portrait format and imposing scale, they seem at odds with the plein-air paintings that define the movement. Central among them is the Frick's own Renoir, ''La Promenade'' (1875-6), in which a stylish young woman guides two equally well-dressed girls along a public garden path. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
- Guggenheim Museum: 'John Chamberlain: Choices' (through May 13) The postwar sculptor John Chamberlain, who died in December, manipulated crushed car parts into abstract clusters that are both gorgeous and terrifying. As installed on the Guggenheim Museum's curved ramps, they look, inevitably, like mangled wrecks on a speedway. Yet the show goes to great lengths to extricate Mr. Chamberlain from what he called ''the car-crash syndrome.'' It includes work made from foam, aluminum foil, paper and plexiglass, and it emphasizes the collage process behind the metal sculptures rather than the material that went into them. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
International Center of Photography: 'The Loving Story: Photographs by Grey Villet' See photo highlight.
- Jewish Museum: 'The Radical Camera: New York's Photo League, 1936-1951' (through March 25) One of many artistic casualties of the McCarthy-era blacklists was the Photo League, a New York school and salon for amateur and professional photographers. Its members -- among them Weegee, Lisette Model and Aaron Siskind -- are now reunited in this stirring show, which traces the group's history through some 145 vintage photographs. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Art in an Age of Revolution: Fu Baoshi (1904-1965)' (through April 15) Serene on the surface but less so underneath, the museum's first full-dress retrospective of a 20th-century Chinese painter is as much about history as art history. It focuses on an artist, teacher and art historian who helped preserve the ancient tradition of ink painting and then struggled to make it relevant under the Communists, bending it toward propaganda, introducing a new degree of realism and making frequent use of the color red. While fascinating, the show leaves you wondering what he might have accomplished under less encumbered circumstances. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso, and the Parisian Avant-Garde' (through June 3) Like the family it chronicles, this exhibition is fragmented and contentious with flashes of brilliance. It explores the closely intertwined collections of the siblings Leo, Gertrude and Michael Stein (and Michael's wife, Sarah), casting these wealthy American expatriates as ahead-of-the-curve art patrons whose tastes and social networks shaped modernism as we know it. And it shows Matisse and Picasso vying for the Steins' attention. Highlights include Matisse's Fauvist ''Woman With a Hat'' and, naturally, Picasso's proto-cubist portrait of Gertrude. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- MoMA PS1: 'Henry Taylor' (through April 9) Mr. Taylor, who lives in Los Angeles, paints fast, loose and sensuously on canvases great and small. Portraiture is his work's center of gravity, African-American life his subject. With exuberant generosity, he portrays friends, relatives, acquaintances from the art world and off the street and heroes of sports and politics. Along the way, he takes in downbeat cityscapes patrolled by cop cars and envisions allegories of spiritual trauma in the Land of the Free. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Rembrandt's World: Dutch Drawings From the Clement C. Moore Collection' (through April 29) You won't see much of Rembrandt in this exhibition, which includes just four drawings attributed to that master. What the show lacks in star power, though, it makes up for with a keen, all-encompassing look at life in the Dutch Republic during its golden age (which corresponds, roughly, to the 17th century). Seascapes assert naval dominance; genre scenes show bustling markets and tipsy taverngoers; botanical illustrations tell cautionary tales about economic speculation. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'Testimonios: 100 Years of Popular Expression' (through May 6) The city's premier museum of Latin culture explores its holdings in urban folk art, so-called handicraft and other forms of vernacular expression and comes up with visual gold. Among the kaleidoscopic displays are Puerto Rican santos and the winsome cellophane animals, birds and insects of Gregorio Marzan (1906-97). Splendid textiles include Haitian voodoo banners; densely appliqued molas and the patchwork scenes called arpilleras, with which Chilean women kept hope alive for disappeared relatives during the regime of Augusto Pinochet. An intoxicating, if sometimes bittersweet, vitality is revealed. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Cindy Sherman' (through June 11) Aided by ever-shifting arrays of costumes, wigs, makeup, props and prosthetic body parts, the leading light of postmodern photo-based art spent nearly four decades turning photography against itself, laying waste to a lexicon of mostly female stereotypes and exposing both the tyranny and the inner lives of the images of women that bombard and shape us all at every turn. This retrospective could have been larger, more clearly organized and less familiar, but its strengths, like the achievement it honors, are undeniable. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
New Museum: 'The Ungovernables: 2012 New Museum Triennial' (through April 22) The second edition of this survey of young talent, organized by Eungie Joo, is more international than the last one, with artists from Asia and South America and collectives from Africa and the Middle East. Much of the work is made up of small, light formal gestures, unemphatic in tone and socially engaged, though in an unperturbed way that accommodates friendliness and wit. There is also a schedule of performances on- and off-site. An Israeli collective, Public Movement, will stage topical debates around town. Yet another collective, House of Natural Fiber, from Indonesia, plans to demonstrate technology for producing alcoholic beverages and electronic music simultaneously. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org.

- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Whitney Biennial 2012' (through May 27) With remarkable clarity of vision, striking spatial intelligence and a generous stylistic inclusiveness, one of the best Whitney Biennials in recent memory confidently weaves together art objects and time-based art -- dance, theater and performance as well as film and video -- on a scale unprecedented in New York. So doing, this especially poetic incarnation also reinvents the museum's signature show and places future biennial curators in its debt, while offering the out-of-control, money-saturated art world a bit of redemption. Visit early and often. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

Paul Graham: 'The Present' (through April 21) The latest series by this British photographer, ''The Present,'' was shot entirely in high-traffic areas of Manhattan (Penn Station, Times Square and 125th Street, among others). Its 16 diptychs and 2 triptychs have a simple premise: They show two or three views of the same intersection, taken seconds apart and from more or less the same angle. People go out of focus or disappear entirely and are replaced by new pedestrians doing pretty much the same thing. Cabs speed by, cellphone conversations end, attentions are diverted and street photography is reinvented for an age of perpetual distraction.

- Ryan McNamara: 'Still' (through April 7) Friday and Saturday are the last days to join in the action-packed picture-taking fun masterminded by this resourceful performance artist, who is aided by backdrops, costumes, props, materials and whatever ideas spring to anyone's mind. Starting next week, we will be able to see more clearly the possibly environmental artwork that Mr. McNamara hath wrought by culling images from the photo sessions and decoupaging them, downsized and tinted, to whatever strikes his fancy.

Guy Goodwin: 'Recent Works' (through April 8) The latest paintings by this veteran abstractionist are laugh-out-loud beautiful. They amp up his longtime interest in bold, roughly painted motifs and objectlike impact through the use of searing color and cut-out (and cut-into) laminated cardboard, with obsessive stapling doing double time as brushwork. More comedic than existential, they make a place for themselves in the tradition of raucous American abstraction that could be said begin with Stuart Davis and George Sugarman.

Sam Moyer: 'Slack Tide' (through April 22) Sam Moyer's beguiling pictures oscillate astutely between the sublime and the decorative. Mounted on panels whose dimensions range from about 5 to 10 feet, they resemble much-enlarged, black-and-white, aerial photographs of mountainous topographies, possibly on another planet. They also are like giant, dark photocopies of profusely wrinkled bed sheets. But they are entirely made by hand.

'Gran Fury: Ready My Lips' (closes on Saturday) A collective that grew out of Act Up and took its name from a New York City police car, Gran Fury existed from the end of 1989 until the mid-'90s. The political climate of that period informs the show, as well as downtown Manhattan's landscape of graffiti, posters and stickers. ''Kissing Doesn't Kill'' (1990), a series of posters displayed on buses, defied contemporary claims that AIDS could be spread by kissing, while ''Read My Lips'' turned George H.W. Bush's famous campaign line into a homoerotic provocation. The haircuts and clothes in the works are dated, but the sentiments overlap powerfully with current activism and the Occupy movement. 80WSE, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse.

- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Renaissance Portrait From Donatello to Bellini' (closes on Sunday) This magisterial, thought-provoking show presents about 160 works by the most celebrated masters of 15th-century Italian painting and sculpture. It was a time when ancient Greek and Roman precedents inspired artists to create lively images of people in two and three dimensions. The dialogue between painting and sculpture is especially intriguing. Desiderio da Settignano's marble bust of a lovely young woman with a strikingly expressive, coquettish expression creates an illusion of fleeting real life that painters could only envy.

Ryan Sullivan (closes on Saturday) The abstract paintings in this stylish and over-full New York gallery debut bend over backward to avoid the conventional, supposedly old-school ploys like adroit brushwork, replacing such familiar tactics with carefully controlled processes of sprayed, poured, festering, rippled and sliding paint that bespeak randomness and chance while evoking Photo Realism, topographical maps and even trompe l'oeil. Eminently promising, they nonetheless look excessively refined and skillful, and more mannered than they should be. Maccarone, 630 Greenwich Street, West Village, (212) 431-4977, maccarone.net.

The story began on July 11, 1958, when a Virginia county sheriff and two deputies entered the Lovings' bedroom at 2 a.m. and arrested them, saying they had violated the Racial Integrity Act. Mr. Villet's images represent the heyday of social documentary, but also the midcentury photo-essay format.

HEADLINE: Global Network Expels as Many as 30 of Iran's Banks in Move to Isolate Its Economy

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE and STEPHEN CASTLE; Rick Gladstone reported from New York, and Stephen Castle from Brussels.

 BODY:
A global communication network vital to the banking industry announced on Thursday that it was expelling as many as 30 Iranian financial institutions -- including the Central Bank -- crippling their ability to conduct international business and further isolating the country from the world economy.
The network, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, took the action to comply with European Union sanctions on Iranian banks, which were enacted in response to Iran's disputed nuclear energy program. 
It is the first time that Swift, a consortium based in Belgium and subject to European Union laws, has taken such a drastic step, which severs a crucial conduit for Iran to electronically repatriate billions of dollars' worth of earnings from the sale of oil and other exports.
Advocates of sanctions against Iran welcomed the action by Swift, which takes effect on Saturday, according to a statement on the network's Web site. The statement said that Swift had been ''instructed to discontinue its communications services to Iranian financial institutions that are subject to European sanctions.''
Lazaro Campos, Swift's chief executive, said in the statement that ''disconnecting banks is an extraordinary and unprecedented step for Swift. It is a direct result of international and multilateral action to intensify financial sanctions against Iran.''
There was no immediate reaction from Iran. But its leaders have consistently criticized the vise of economic sanctions on its financial and oil industries as illegal and as bullying by the Western powers. The United States and European Union have used the sanctions to pressure Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities, out of suspicion that it is surreptitiously trying to achieve the capability to make nuclear weapons.
While Iran insists the uranium enrichment is for peaceful purposes, it agreed last week to a resumption of long-stalled negotiations to resolve the dispute. It had been conducting the talks with the five permanent members of the Security Council and Germany, but the negotiations were ended out of frustration with what the Western powers characterized as Iran's pattern of insincerity and stalling.
Supporters of the sanctions said Iran's new willingness to talk was proof that the strategy could succeed -- and in any case was preferable to military action to stop the nuclear program. Israel, which regards Iran as its most dangerous enemy, has threatened to attack suspected nuclear sites in Iran if it concludes that sanctions are not working. President Obama has counseled Israeli leaders to give the sanctions more time.
The announcement by Swift came a day after Mr. Obama, meeting in Washington with Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain, warned Iran to negotiate in good faith at the talks, expected to take place in coming weeks. ''The window for solving this issue diplomatically is shrinking,'' Mr. Obama said.
Even before the Swift announcement, Iran was confronting problems stemming from its regional banking partners' anticipation of its troubles conducting financial transactions. Major foreign exchange houses in the United Arab Emirates have stopped handling the Iranian currency, the rial, over the last several weeks because of the risk, Reuters reported Thursday, quoting trading executives there, putting further pressure on the currency, which has declined by about 50 percent in the last year.
Swift's announcement did not specify the number of expelled Iranian banks or mention them by name, and the European Union has not yet announced a formal list. But the European Union sanctions apply to the Central Bank of Iran and other major Iranian banks, including Bank Melli, Bank Mellat, Tejarat Bank, Bank Refah, Future Bank, Persia International Bank, Post Bank and Europaisch-Iranische Handelsbank. Up to 30 institutions could be affected.
''It is a very efficient measure,'' said a European Union official. ''It can seriously cripple the banking sector of Iran.''
The Swift network connects more than 10,000 financial institutions and corporations in 210 countries, allowing them to exchange automated financial information securely. According to Swift's 2010 annual review, the latest available, 19 Iranian member banks and 25 financial institutions used the network more than 2 million times that year.
Swift's decision is a turnabout from a month ago, when advocates of stronger sanctions in the United States were publicly pressuring it to expel Iranian banks, arguing that Swift was legally required to act in order to close a loophole that permitted sanctioned banks to evade penalty.
Swift argued that it was already complying with the sanctions, but later said it was working with regulators in the European Union and United States ''to find the right multilateral legal framework which will enable Swift to address the issues.''
David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, issued a statement praising Swift's action, which he said ''reinforces the isolation of designated Iranian banks from the international financial sector.'' He said the United States would ''continue to work closely with our European and other partners in the international community to increase further the pressure on Iran and to strengthen the impact of our sanctions.''
Advocacy groups in the United States hailed the announcement.
''This could deny Iran's banks the ability to move billions of dollars, and ratchet up the economic pressure on leaders who have so far refused to reach a negotiated settlement on their illegal nuclear weapons program,'' said Mark Dubowitz, executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a nonprofit group in Washington, who has advised the administration and Congress on the sanctions strategy.
Mark D. Wallace, president of United Against Nuclear Iran, a group that advocates sanctions, called Swift's action ''a significant step in the right direction,'' adding, ''In order to implement the most robust sanctions in history, Iran should be cut off from the international banking system.''

HEADLINE: Geithner Says U.S. Economy Showing Signs of Expansion

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The nation's economy shows signs of expansion but still faces tough challenges that call for measures to create jobs to help restore fiscal sustainability, the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said on Thursday. 
In prepared remarks for delivery to the Economic Club of New York, Mr. Geithner said the economy was now more productive than it was before the recent financial crisis but confidence remained fragile.
''That is why it is so important that policy makers continue to work to get the economy growing faster in the short term and not shift prematurely to fiscal restraint,'' he said. ''We can't cut our way to growth. Severe austerity now would be very damaging,'' he added.
Mr. Geithner said that at the end of 2012, the country will face a simultaneous expiration of tax cuts and across-the-board spending cuts that will amount to about 5 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
The prospect of such a blow to national output should be a strong incentive for lawmakers to reach compromises on taxes and spending, he suggested.
Mr. Geithner said the White House was promoting a package of measures that included some tax increases for wealthy Americans. Those increases have been opposed by Republicans.
''If you do not raise revenues through tax reform,'' he said, ''then you have to find another 1 percent of G.D.P. or roughly $1.5 trillion over 10 years in additional savings from defense, Social Security, Medicare, education or low income programs.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Loses Luster On Campus

BYLINE: By KEVIN ROOSE

 BODY:
Wall Street, once a magnet for America's best and brightest, is facing a recruiting problem.
The industry's cachet, which was tarnished during the financial disaster, has been further stained by the lingering economic slowdown and a series of highly publicized industry scandals that have drawn critical attention to the big banks.
The most recent public relations storm stemmed from a resignation letter this week on The New York Times Op-Ed page, written by Greg Smith, a former Goldman Sachs executive director. Mr. Smith, who took the bank to task over what he described as a ''toxic and destructive'' culture at the firm, said his moment of ultimate realization had come while extolling the benefits of a Goldman career to college students. 
''I knew it was time to leave when I realized I could no longer look students in the eye and tell them what a great place this was to work,'' he wrote.
The controversy has raised fears - perhaps within Goldman itself - that skittish clients and down-in-the-mouth employees could bolt. But financial firms should also worry that the incident might scare off college and business school students, some of whom are looking askance at once-prestigious jobs in finance.
Cory Finley, a recent Yale graduate, applied to work at Bridgewater Associates, a large Connecticut-based hedge fund, during his senior year of college. Mr. Finley, 23, said there was ''definitely something tempting'' about the structure and prestige of a high-paying finance job. But he decided to follow his dream of becoming a playwright instead.
''It's something that fulfills me in a deep way,'' said Mr. Finley, who has written a play called ''The Private Sector'' that is set at a hedge fund corporate retreat. ''I don't judge people who do go into finance, but it's not for me personally.''
College students who were once attracted to prestigious banks like moths to bonfires are increasingly turning to other industries in search of success. Insiders say that harsh testimonials of industry life can deter would-be financiers from even applying for jobs at the most selective firms.
''This is a significant problem for Goldman,'' said Adam Zoia, the chief executive of the placement firm Glocap Search, whose clients include many aspiring big-bank employees and hedge fund workers. ''Their perch of being the investment bank to go to is definitely at risk.''
One former Goldman analyst recently decided to leave the firm after the rewards of a finance job no longer seemed to outweigh the costs. He is now working at a small technology start-up for less money.
''Perhaps Smith is a catalyst,'' said the employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because many of his friends still worked at the bank.
''There have always been unhappy people'' in finance, he added, but ''this is the year people are realizing things are structurally different.''
Smaller paychecks and waves of layoffs are only making the decision easier for some students, who no longer view Wall Street as a fast track to seven-figure salaries. Last year, flagging profits at many financial firms reduced some bankers' compensation from stratospheric to merely generous. At Morgan Stanley, cash bonuses were capped at $125,000; annual cash payments for some Goldman employees were cut in half.
Adding to the chorus of dissent, students now face criticism on their own campuses. Groups of protestors at Yale and Harvard stood outside bank recruiting sessions last fall, shouting slogans and holding signs with messages like ''Take a chance, don't go into finance.'' At Princeton, a group affiliated with the Occupy Wall Street movement interrupted sessions by JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, urging their fellow students to rebel against what it said was ''the campus culture that whitewashes the crooked dealings of Wall Street as a prestigious career path.''
''Everything from Occupy Wall Street to larger critical discourses of 'fat cats,' all of that has had some trickle-down effect'' to young people, said Karen Ho, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Minnesota, who has studied the culture of Wall Street.
The decline in the finance industry's allure has been accelerated by the explosion of the technology industry. A 2011 survey of 6,700 young professionals by the consulting firm Universum ranked Google, Apple and Facebook as the most coveted workplaces; JPMorgan Chase, the highest-ranking bank on the survey, was 41st.
At this year's SXSW Interactive conference in Austin, Tex., a panel called ''Keeping Kids off the Street: Wall St. vs. Start-ups'' was convened to address questions including whether the finance industry was to blame for what organizers called a ''failure to nurture a culture of innovation'' in New York. Chris Wiggins, an associate professor of applied math at Columbia University who sat on the panel, said he was seeing students shy away from Wall Street and veer toward industries where they could work and profit without bringing their morality under the microscope.
''The claim of investment banking that it serves a social purpose by 'lubricating capitalism' has eroded,'' Professor Wiggins said. ''It's simply very difficult for young people to believe that they're serving any social purpose now.''
Even at top colleges and business schools, where Wall Street was once considered hallowed ground, the focus is shifting. In 2008, the last recruiting year before the financial crisis, 28 percent of the employed seniors in Harvard's graduating class went into finance. Last year, that number fell to 17 percent, as students opted for other fields and investment banks cut their ranks.
Ben Pruden, a second-year student at the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin, said on Wednesday that he planned to go into technology, not to Wall Street, after receiving his business degree. He has a job lined up at salesforce.com after graduation, and said that although he knew people working in finance, including his sister, Wall Street held little sway with him.
''I have no interest in working at Goldman,'' he said. ''I want to build something. I don't want to be working in an industry that effectively leeches off other industries.''
Mr. Pruden added, ''it's not creative enough for me.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Preventing and Treating Dental Disease in Children

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Young and in Surgery for a Mouthful of Cavities'' (front page, March 6) clearly indicates the need to engage families and communities in positive oral health activities. It is tragic that millions of children suffer from pain and embarrassment of preventable pediatric dental disease. 
Failing to prevent pediatric dental disease can inhibit a child's ability to learn and grow. Children with serious dental disease find themselves in a downward spiral that negatively affects their adult lives, including limited employment potential and lifelong health problems.
The economic and social consequences of rampant dental disease affect everyone. National Children's Oral Health Foundation: America's Toothfairy supports the delivery of oral health education and care beginning at the prenatal level, including an engaging kids club. It is imperative that we provide families with resources and education to change their oral health behavior and prevent this devastating disease.
FERN INGBER President and Chief Executive National Children's Oral Health Foundation Charlotte, N.C., March 9, 2012
To the Editor:
Your article illuminated the increase in preschoolers with extensive dental decay needing general anesthesia for humane completion of dental work. This is now frequently taking place, safely and comfortably, in the child's own dentist's office, made possible by a highly trained dentist-anesthesiologist.
The safety record of in-office anesthesia administered and monitored by a dentist-anesthesiologist is exemplary.
Dentist-anesthesiologists complete a two-year postdoctoral program in anesthesiology. Typically traveling with mobile operating-room equipment, we evaluate the patient, then safely deliver the appropriate anesthetic treatment. Patients with autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and paralyzing fear are also candidates for dental anesthesia.
Until dental decay is eradicated, we will be there to provide safe, humane and affordable anesthesia, giving these patients the access to care they deserve.

10 P.M. (Sundance) LOVELY AND AMAZING (2002) Nicole Holofcener examines narcissism and its fallout in this story about two sisters, both in their 30s: Elizabeth (Emily Mortimer, above), an attractive actress who was rejected for a role in a soap opera for not being sexy enough, and Michelle (Catherine Keener), an artist who designs gift-shop tchotchkes and has anger-management issues. Brenda Blethyn plays Jane, their mother, a divorced matriarch and something of a diva who has recently adopted a black 8-year-old daughter, Annie (Raven Goodwin), whose biological mother was a crack addict. When Jane develops complications from liposuction, Elizabeth and Michelle are left to care for Annie while enduring their own crises with the men in their lives. ''As smart and observant as it is, 'Lovely and Amazing' doesn't really go anywhere,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times.
NOON (ESPN2 and ESPN3) 2012 WINTER X GAMES EUROPE The competition in Tignes, France, wraps up with finals in the women's and men's snowboard slopestyle and the men's skiing superpipe.

9 P.M. (USA) FAIRLY LEGAL Kate Reed (Sarah Shahi), the litigator turned mediator, has a new conflict when her potential romance with Ben Grogan (Ryan Johnson, above with Ms. Shahi) fuels the tension in her relationships with her soon-to-be-ex-husband, Justin Patrick (Michael Trucco), and her boss and very young stepmother, Lauren Reed (Virginia Williams). In this Season 2 premiere Kate takes a case of a corporation and a former employee who claims he was exposed to toxic chemicals on the job. The fifth and final season of ''In Plain Sight'' begins at 10, as Mary (Mary McCormack) returns from maternity leave and discovers a new dynamic in the office before being assigned to protect a witness who could destroy a secret society. But will Mary be able to balance work and motherhood, or will she put the baby up for adoption?

HEADLINE: Paving Path To Fraud On Wall St.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Nearly 20 years ago, Bankers Trust was riding high. The bank, based in New York, had become known as an expert in then-newfangled derivative securities, and the profits were flowing in. In an era where commercial banks were often viewed as stodgy and unimaginative, it stood out as a shining light. Corporate treasurers sought its insights about ways to maximize income from idle cash. Wall Street firms scrambled to compete.
Then the tapes came out.
On those tapes, recorded in 1993 and 1994, Bankers Trust executives were heard to discuss how they were misleading customers who did not understand what they were doing. Speaking among themselves, bankers used the term ''R.O.F.'' It stood for ''rip-off factor,'' the amount the bank could take from unsuspecting clients. 
Those clients included Procter & Gamble and Gibson Greetings, which had entered into contracts with Bankers Trust for complex interest-rate swaps that would raise the companies' incomes a little if interest rates continued to fall -- as the conventional wisdom then said they would -- but result in enormous losses if rates rose only a little bit. Rates rose more than a little, and the companies soon found evidence they had been told lies and sued. Eventually, Bankers Trust was forced to settle.
Bankers Trust was never the same after that. It was still a swashbuckling trading firm, but in 1998 it made some bad bets of its own. It wound up being acquired by Deutsche Bank. On the way out, the company pleaded guilty to defrauding the state of New York by seizing abandoned funds that should have gone to the state.
The fate of Bankers Trust came to mind this week when a midlevel Goldman Sachs banker chose to leave the company with a blast delivered through the Op-Ed page of The New York Times. ''I attend derivatives sales meetings where not one single minute is spent asking questions about how we can help clients,'' wrote Greg Smith. ''It's purely about how we can make the most possible money off of them.''
Bankers Trust gave us the term ''R.O.F.'' Mr. Smith says Goldman referred to its clients as ''Muppets,'' talked about ''ripping eyeballs out'' and rewarded employees for ''hunting elephants,'' a term he said meant persuading clients to do whatever would be most profitable for Goldman.
In finance, acting like a shark who will rip your opponents into little pieces has long been viewed as a positive thing. Such a reputation will even draw in clients who want to harness those tactics for their own benefit. The catch for Goldman could be, as it was for Bankers Trust, that the clients will flee if they think the firm intends to rip them off.
Goldman has a far stronger market position now than Bankers Trust ever did. Its competitors may not be as publicly aggressive as Citi was back in the 1990s, when it went after Bankers Trust customers with an ad proclaiming, ''You expect derivatives to solve problems, not create them.'' But they will be quietly courting clients by saying they will work for the customer, not against him.
Mr. Smith will be offered opportunities, possibly by clients whose trades did not work out, to get specific about how Goldman ill-served its customers. If he takes any of them, Goldman's pain may endure.
One of the amazing stories of this year has been the fact that Wall Street, for all its public opprobrium, is on the brink of a major legislative victory to roll back decades of regulation and rules aimed at preventing underwriters from ripping off customers.
Last week, the House of Representatives, with the support of every Republican and most Democrats -- as well as a White House endorsement -- passed something it called the ''Jump-start Our Business Start-ups Act,'' or JOBS for short. The logic is that if we can just make it easier for companies to raise capital, they will hire more people.
Do you remember the scandals of the dot-com era? Then Wall Street firms got business by promising companies that they would write positive research reports if the company would only hire them to underwrite an initial public offering of stock. Companies went public at a feverish pitch, often rising to amazing heights without much in the way of sales, let alone profits. Then it all came crashing down.
In the aftermath, the brokers were forced by the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the New York attorney general, to mend their ways. No longer would analysts be allowed to go on such I.P.O. sales calls.
This bill would end that rule for all but the biggest new offerings -- those that involved companies with sales of over $1 billion. And it would go much further. As the law stands now, to keep underwriters from making sales pitches that go beyond what companies are allowed to say, the underwriters are prohibited from publishing research on a company while its initial public offering is under way. This bill would allow such research, and would say that the company bore no responsibility for what was said in it. Effectively, there would be a second prospectus -- one largely immune to securities laws and free to hype the offering by making forecasts not otherwise allowed.
Why is this needed? Advocates point to the fact there are fewer initial public offerings now than there were during the Internet bubble. That most of those offerings were horrible investments is conveniently ignored. Nor is any consideration given to the idea that once-burned investors might be more wary. The explanation must be excessive and unreasonably expensive regulation.
The bill also relaxes rules for new offerings in other ways. There are limits now to keep private offerings private, rather than allow them to be pitched widely. Forget that. The bill endorses the wonderful concept of ''crowdfunding,'' in which anyone can post an idea on the Web and raise money for it. If you raise only $1 million that way, then you don't even have to provide financial statements. You are under no obligation whatever to keep investors informed. If you are willing to put out a financial statement when you seek the money, you can get up to $2 million.
One interesting aspect of the bill is that while it would make it a lot easier for companies to raise capital without disclosing very much, it would also make it easier for companies that are public -- and have the capital -- to ''go dark'' and stop providing financial information to their shareholders. The basic message to investors would seem to be: Give us your money and then don't bother us any more.
Last year, the S.E.C., worried about a spate of frauds, required Chinese companies to follow the same rules that American ones do, with prospectuses made public as soon as they were filed. Since last summer, there have been no new Chinese initial public offerings in the United States. That tightening of regulation would be reversed by this bill.
''If you like those e-mails from Nigerian scammers, wait until you see the new round about to come from shady Chinese companies looking for investment -- and they will be legal,'' said Paul Gillis, a former auditor for PricewaterhouseCoopers in China who is now a visiting professor of accounting at Peking University.
In an interview, Mr. Gillis praised Section 404, the part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that requires companies going public to have effective internal controls, and for auditors to certify them. ''When companies list, they hire consultants to help them design internal control systems to provide integrity in their reports,'' he said. ''These control systems are new to these countries. They have helped significantly. There have been only a couple of Chinese companies subject to 404 that have been frauds.''
As a result of intense lobbying by small businesses, Section 404 never was enforced on American companies with market values under $75 million. The new bill would exempt any newly public company for five years, unless it grew to the point that it had shares worth $700 million in public hands or had revenue of over $1 billion.
Any company that chose to go public in the conventional way, with a prospectus, could file privately with the S.E.C., so the public would see the offering only when it was cleaned up after commission review. If the commission missed something, there would be little time for anyone else to notice.
Securities regulators were almost invisible when the House passed its bill last week. This week a group of state regulators -- concerned in part by the way state regulation is pre-empted -- and Mary Schapiro, the S.E.C. chairwoman, wrote to senators seeking changes to make the bill less outrageous. They failed to get any changes made before the bill went to the floor this week, but the Senate is slated to vote Tuesday on a substitute that would add some investor safeguards, proposed on Thursday by three Democratic senators, Jack Reed, Carl Levin and Mary Landrieu.
It gives some flavor of just how far the House bill goes that one of the changes the three senators are pushing would force a company trying to raise money from the public to show investors an audited balance sheet. Even if their substitute is adopted, we will still get ''crowdfunding,'' but with a few extra safeguards. Wall Street will still have a major victory, and investors will have less protection than they do now.
''In three years, or maybe five years, they'll be back to fix these loopholes, because there will be a huge amount of fraud,'' Mr. Gillis forecast.
He suggested the bill be renamed the ''Jump-start Our Bilking of Suckers Act.''

HEADLINE: Don't Cut Pensions, Expand Them

BYLINE: By TERESA GHILARDUCCI. 
Teresa Ghilarducci, a professor of economics at the New School, is the author of ''When I'm Sixty-Four: The Plot Against Pensions and the Plan to Save Them.''

 BODY:
ON Thursday morning the New York State Legislature agreed to a deal limiting pensions for future public employees. The state thus joins 43 others that have recently enacted legislation curtailing public retirement benefits.
Though New York needs to reduce its spending, the cuts come at a particularly bad time: over a third of New York workers, both public and private, approaching retirement age have less than $10,000 in liquid assets. As a result, those workers are projected to be poor or near poor in retirement, with an average budget of about $7 a day for food and approximately $600 a month for housing.
Fortunately, there's an easy solution. Rather than curtailing public and private pensions, New York and other states could save millions of workers from impending poverty by creating public pensions for everyone. 
While the recession bears some blame for the looming retirement crisis, experts agree that the primary cause is more fundamental: Most workers do not have retirement accounts at work. Over half of the workers in New York State, more than four million people in 2010, do not participate in retirement plans with their current employers, while over half of American workers do not have pension plans at work.
Private-sector pensions have been on the retreat for decades. In fact, in the late 1970s and early '80s, Congress, worried about the dismal rate of pension coverage, tried to remedy the situation by extending 401(k) plans, originally designed for executives, to everyone, while also passing a law to create individual retirement accounts.
The problem is that these steps set up incentives through the tax code, which means that the biggest benefits go to the highest earners -- people who, moreover, would probably have saved anyway. Today 79 percent of such tax breaks go to the top 20 percent of workers.
Meanwhile, despite extensive commercial advertising for retirement planning, coverage for ordinary people stalled. And even many of those who do save for retirement fail to consistently put away the 5 to 10 percent of their pay necessary to adequately supplement their Social Security benefits.
In response, in late February California State Senator Kevin De Leon and Darrell Steinberg, the Senate president pro tempore, introduced legislation that would allow private-sector workers in California to enroll in a modest, state-operated retirement program financed by the workers and their employers -- at virtually no cost to taxpayers.
This would increase coverage because employers would put every worker into a plan, either their own or the California plan. In the California version workers could opt out; some will, but most workers once in a plan will stay in.
Also in February, John Liu, the New York City comptroller, called for a similar plan for New York City residents. His program would pool employee and employer contributions into a professionally managed, citywide retirement fund.
Both plans would use the same professional staff and institutional money managers that invest the state and city pension funds to manage contributions made by participating employers and employees in the private sector.
This is a vital step: public pension plans usually outperform 401(k) plans and individual retirement accounts, because instead of a single worker managing a single account, large institutional plans pool workers of all ages, diversify the portfolio over longer time periods, use the best professional managers that aren't available for retail accounts and have the bargaining power to lower fees and prioritize long-term investment.
By some estimates, costs for public pensions are over 45 percent lower than for individual 401(k) plans. Of course, since these plans would be financed by workers and their employers, there would be no cost to taxpayers.
Saving for retirement is never easy. But finding a safe place to put your money these days is even harder. Opening up public pension options to everyone is a cheap, simple way to help.

HEADLINE: Party Ousts Chinese Regional Chief, Halting His Rise

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS. 
Jonathan Ansfield, Mia Li and Li Bibo contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Bo Xilai, the brash Communist Party chief of China's sprawling Chongqing municipality, has been removed from his post, an unmistakable sign that recent scandals in that city have put an end to his political ambitions and complicated the national leadership transition that will take place this autumn.
The news, announced Thursday morning in a brief dispatch by the official Xinhua news agency, said that Vice Prime Minister Zhang Dejiang, a North Korean-educated economist, would replace him as Chongqing party secretary. Xinhua did not mention a new job for Mr. Bo or say whether he would keep his spot on the party's 25-seat Politburo.
Until recently, Mr. Bo had been a prime contender for the all-powerful Standing Committee of the Politburo, a nine-member body that effectively runs the country. Seven members are to be replaced, and Mr. Bo's demotion suggests there will be more drama in a usually secret process. 
Tall, charismatic and unusually loquacious for a Chinese official, Mr. Bo, 63, is the son of a revolutionary hero and was well-positioned -- thanks to his extensive connections -- to ascend the party hierarchy.
His prospects clouded last month when a handpicked deputy, Wang Lijun, sought refuge in the United States Consulate in Chengdu, a city in Sichuan Province about 210 miles from Chongqing. Mr. Wang, who had reportedly fallen out with Mr. Bo and, according to an American official, had feared for his safety, spent the night in the consulate before being escorted to Beijing by security officers.
On Thursday, Mr. Wang was removed from his post as vice mayor, according to a state media dispatch issued shortly after Mr. Bo's demotion was announced.
For a party obsessed with secrecy and the sheen of stability, the past five weeks have been especially roiling. Ding Xueliang, a social scientist at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, said Mr. Wang's visit to the consulate -- during which American officials say he revealed damaging information about Mr. Bo -- set off a cascade of events that has convulsed the party establishment.
''The Wang Lijun incident has changed the rules of the game by drawing international attention to internal politics,'' Mr. Ding said. ''What the party fears most are abnormal events like this.''
The political high jinks have riveted ordinary Chinese and emboldened Mr. Bo's many critics, who assailed a populist governing style that included a ferocious assault on criminals, entrepreneurs and political enemies.
Not long after arriving in the fog-shrouded mountain city in 2007, Mr. Bo began a ''red'' campaign that urged its residents to sing Cultural Revolution-era songs and peppered their cell phones with Maoist slogans. He also introduced what became known as the ''Chongqing model'' of economic development, which included lavish infrastructure spending and tending to the needs of the municipality's poor.
While popular in the city of 30 million, Mr. Bo's style unnerved some who said his tactics and revolutionary rhetoric threatened to revive the destructive ways of China's leftist past.
Mr. Wang, a longtime ally, was instrumental in carrying out Chongqing's law-and-order juggernaut. When he held the job of police chief, he took on the city's gangs, arresting 2,000 people, including high-level Communist Party officials accused of shielding crime lords. Some people, however, lambasted the campaign as cutting judicial corners; 13 people were executed after speedy trials.
Mr. Bo's reputation for running roughshod over established legal norms was heightened by the prosecution of Li Zhuang, a prominent Beijing defense lawyer who was jailed on charges that he encouraged a client to fake testimony during his trial in Chongqing. The case was widely viewed as unfair.
Sentenced to 18 months in prison, Mr. Li was released early through the intervention of powerful allies in Beijing, but the incident only earned Mr. Bo more foes.
The polarization he wrought extended through China's political core. Supporters included his patron, former President Jiang Zemin, and neo-leftist academics who hailed his wealth-redistribution efforts.
Among his many detractors were liberal reformers and those who favor the established system of quiet, collective leadership.
Mr. Zhang, 65, Mr. Bo's replacement, is also a member of the ruling Politburo and he has previously served as party chief in three other provinces. Like Mr. Bo, he is a protege of Mr. Jiang, the former president, who wields considerable power despite his failing health. Analysts say Mr. Zhang's appointment as Chongqing party secretary is probably an interim measure but could burnish his chances for ascension to the Standing Committee.
Mr. Bo's fate was evidently sealed Wednesday, when Prime Minister Wen Jiabao -- the country's most prominent voice for political reform -- made a thinly veiled swipe at him during a news conference marking the end of the annual meeting of the National People's Congress.
Prompted by a question from a reporter, Mr. Wen suggested that Mr. Bo's brand of politics risked reviving the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.
''The current party committee and government in Chongqing must seriously reflect on the Wang Lijun incident and learn lessons from that incident,'' the prime minister said, in comments that were broadcast on national television. ''What has happened shows that any practice that we take must be based on the experience and lessons we have gained from history.''
On Wednesday night Li Yuanchao, head of the party's Organization Department, the secretive body that oversees key personnel decisions, reportedly flew to Chongqing to break the news to the city's political establishment.
One Beijing analyst with senior-level connections said that Mr. Bo might still face an investigation relating to Mr. Wang's case and the evidence he had provided against him.
''For now, Bo Xilai has been hung on the rack,'' the analyst said, adding that the final denouement could be months away. ''He has no power and no position.''
That assessment could not be immediately confirmed, and without any word on a new assignment it was possible that Mr. Bo might still retain some job in the party, even if it proved to be largely ceremonial.
One state media official with ties to the party leadership said he thought the repercussions for Mr. Bo would end with his demotion, given the delicacy of factional politics and the party's desire to limit public fallout from the Chongqing scandal.
With the state news media largely silent on Mr. Bo's fate -- save for the sole austere Xinhua dispatch -- most Chinese turned to social media to sate their curiosity and share rumors. On Thursday, the topic ''Bo Xilai'' was the No. 1 topic on Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblog service, which dispensed with the heavy-handed filtering that sometimes excises politically sensitive chatter.
Many of the posts mocked Mr. Bo or cheered his political demise, but others expressed appreciation for his efforts to spur economic growth and champion Chongqing's struggling farmers.
''Bo gave us annual 15 percent growth. Every day he gave 1.3 million rural children free eggs and milk,'' read one posting. ''He gave rural residents the same health insurance as urban residents. I will miss him.''

HEADLINE: More on the Parting Shot at Goldman

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs,'' by Greg Smith (Op-Ed, March 14):
Every executive who has led a large organization has received a letter like this and is right to take it seriously. Setting aside the drama of an icon like Goldman Sachs as the target, this letter brings two lessons for leaders of all organizations. 
First, culture matters. Our study of 500,000 employees from 150 companies shows that companies with very healthy cultures have lower misconduct and labor costs, and deliver long-term shareholder returns 5.8 percentage points higher than the average company.
Second, leaders are often the last to know. Sixty percent of managers we surveyed said they would share negative information with their executive teams only if the amount of company profit at stake was more than $1 million.
So while Mr. Smith intended this to be a message to Goldman's leadership, it presents the opportunity for leaders at many organizations to better understand where their culture falls short of their goals.
THOMAS MONAHAN III Arlington, Va., March 15, 2012
The writer is chairman and chief executive of Corporate Executive Board, a research and advisory services firm.
To the Editor:
Back in 1971-72, when I was special counsel and director of the House of Representatives Securities Industry Study, a trading day on the New York Stock Exchange of 20 million shares was truly exceptional, quaint compared with today's 8 billion to 15 billion shares. The market crisis of 1967-68 was largely national in scope, not like the 2008 market disaster, which risked a global financial meltdown.
Yet Greg Smith's article shows that the lessons of history have still not been learned: firms that, for selfishness and greed, lose the confidence of their customers are doomed to fail. Private entities or governments that care only for the short term and subsist on credit are also doomed. Eventually, the waiter always arrives with the check.
WILLIAM H. PAINTER Washington, March 15, 2012
To the Editor:
About the Op-Ed heard 'round the world:
Those who say Greg Smith will never work on Wall Street again display the shallow bravado of Street insiders and actually help him make his point about their lack of integrity.
He is guaranteed to be hired. I, for one, would like to see him in a managing director role in the firms managing my retirement money (hear that, TIAA-CREF and Merrill Lynch?).
Mr. Smith's one essay is worth a thousand posters in the ''Occupy'' spirit.

HEADLINE: Natural Born Drillers

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
To be a modern Republican in good standing, you have to believe -- or pretend to believe -- in two miracle cures for whatever ails the economy: more tax cuts for the rich and more drilling for oil. And with prices at the pump on the rise, so is the chant of ''Drill, baby, drill.'' More and more, Republicans are telling us that gasoline would be cheap and jobs plentiful if only we would stop protecting the environment and let energy companies do whatever they want.
Thus Mitt Romney claims that gasoline prices are high not because of saber-rattling over Iran, but because President Obama won't allow unrestricted drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Meanwhile, Stephen Moore of The Wall Street Journal tells readers that America as a whole could have a jobs boom, just like North Dakota, if only the environmentalists would get out of the way. 
The irony here is that these claims come just as events are confirming what everyone who did the math already knew, namely, that U.S. energy policy has very little effect either on oil prices or on overall U.S. employment. For the truth is that we're already having a hydrocarbon boom, with U.S. oil and gas production rising and U.S. fuel imports dropping. If there were any truth to drill-here-drill-now, this boom should have yielded substantially lower gasoline prices and lots of new jobs. Predictably, however, it has done neither.
Why the hydrocarbon boom? It's all about the fracking. The combination of horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing of shale and other low-permeability rocks has opened up large reserves of oil and natural gas to production. As a result, U.S. oil production has risen significantly over the past three years, reversing a decline over decades, while natural gas production has exploded.
Given this expansion, it's hard to claim that excessive regulation has crippled energy production. Indeed, reporting in The Times makes it clear that U.S. policy has been seriously negligent -- that the environmental costs of fracking have been underplayed and ignored. But, in a way, that's the point. The reality is that far from being hobbled by eco-freaks, the energy industry has been given a largely free hand to expand domestic oil and gas production, never mind the environment.
Strange to say, however, while natural gas prices have dropped, rising oil production and a sharp fall in import dependence haven't stopped gasoline prices from rising toward $4 a gallon. Nor has the oil and gas boom given a noticeable boost to an economic recovery that, despite better news lately, has been very disappointing on the jobs front.
As I said, this was totally predictable.
First up, oil prices. Unlike natural gas, which is expensive to ship across oceans, oil is traded on a world market -- and the big developments moving prices in that market usually have little to do with events in the United States. Oil prices are up because of rising demand from China and other emerging economies, and more recently because of war scares in the Middle East; these forces easily outweigh any downward pressure on prices from rising U.S. production. And the same thing would happen if Republicans got their way and oil companies were set free to drill freely in the Gulf of Mexico and punch holes in the tundra: the effect on prices at the pump would be negligible.
Meanwhile, what about jobs? I have to admit that I started laughing when I saw The Wall Street Journal offering North Dakota as a role model. Yes, the oil boom there has pushed unemployment down to 3.2 percent, but that's only possible because the whole state has fewer residents than metropolitan Albany -- so few residents that adding a few thousand jobs in the state's extractive sector is a really big deal. The comparable-sized fracking boom in Pennsylvania has had hardly any effect on the state's overall employment picture, because, in the end, not that many jobs are involved.
And this tells us that giving the oil companies carte blanche isn't a serious jobs program. Put it this way: Employment in oil and gas extraction has risen more than 50 percent since the middle of the last decade, but that amounts to only 70,000 jobs, around one-twentieth of 1 percent of total U.S. employment. So the idea that drill, baby, drill can cure our jobs deficit is basically a joke.
Why, then, are Republicans pretending otherwise? Part of the answer is that the party is rewarding its benefactors: the oil and gas industry doesn't create many jobs, but it does spend a lot of money on lobbying and campaign contributions. The rest of the answer is simply the fact that conservatives have no other job-creation ideas to offer.
And intellectual bankruptcy, I'm sorry to say, is a problem that no amount of drilling and fracking can solve.

HEADLINE: A Code for Outer Space, as Seen From the State Dept.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Hands Off the Heavens,'' by John R. Bolton and John Yoo (Op-Ed, March 9): From GPS navigation to cellular communications, the benefits of space permeate our lives and are vital to our national security and economy. Maintaining American leadership is absolutely critical. 
But orbital debris and irresponsible actions in space have increased the chance of collisions that could have damaging consequences for the United States and others.
As more nations and organizations use space, the United States must work with our allies and partners to minimize these problems. The United States is joining with the European Union and others to develop an International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities to reduce the potential threat to American space assets by endorsing nonbinding best practices and transparency and confidence-building measures.
It is important to clarify several points with respect to the code. It is still under development, we would not subscribe to any code unless it protects and enhances our national security, and the code would not be legally binding.
An International Code of Conduct for Outer Space Activities would be like the Hague Code of Conduct Against Ballistic Missile Proliferation adopted by the previous administration and would not require Senate advice and consent. As we move forward, we will continue to consult with Congress, American industry and the American public.

HEADLINE: Literary Readings Are Free at KGB Bar

BYLINE: By RACHEL LEE HARRIS

 BODY:
It's not difficult to entertain a miser in New York. There are plenty of options for cheap entertainment in any borough. But when it comes to quality culture, a few of New York's arts institutions seem to go the extra mile, while forgoing that extra dollar.
Here's a tip for those who want to attract more misers: Consistency is crucial. And you can always rely on KGB Bar in the East Village for your weekly lit fix. This hub for budding and established literati has been showcasing new work since it opened in 1993 and rarely charges a cover. You can count on hearing poetry on Monday nights (Jason Schneiderman, the recipient of the Emily Dickinson Award from the Poetry Society of America in 2004 and the director of the Writing Center at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, presents next week); ''True Story Nonfiction'' on Tuesdays (Dave Isay, the founder of StoryCorps, will be there on March 27); and on Sundays, Suzanne Dottino gathers some of the hottest contemporary fiction writers to talk about their latest works (look for Joseph Mattson and other contributors to the book ''The Speed Chronicles'' this weekend). The bar has 50 varieties of vodka to help smooth any awkward passages. 
(Free, 7 p.m., 85 East Fourth Street, between Second Avenue and Bowery; 212-505-3360, kgbbar.com.)
Since its start in 2006 the Glasslands Gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, has established itself as an outlet for independent music. New bands with names like Landlady and Basement Batman bleed cool from the funky art space set inside an industrial building. On Monday the Crystal Fighters, fresh from SXSW in Austin, play their Basque-influenced synthesized pop after an opening by the Tubetops, followed by a D.J. set from Antoine Karl & the Woofgang.
($15 advance, $20 day of show, opens at 8:30 p.m.; 289 Kent Avenue, between South First and South Second Streets; glasslands.blogspot.com.)
Despite the tough turn for many theaters since the recession, the Joyce in Chelsea, a haven for international dance companies of all types and sizes, is still able to offer $10 tickets to almost every performance. The stage is currently being stomped by the modern stalwart the Martha Graham Dance Company, and then there are the ancient Indian rituals of the Nrityagram Dance Ensemble and the fast and furious Latin-African fusion of Dance Brazil.
Fourteen more companies will arrive for the spring and summer season, which continues through Aug. 18. The classical Indian dancer Shantala Shivalingappa showcases a new work, parts of which she created while in residency with Pina Bausch (June 27 to July 1); and the tap dancer Jason Samuels Smith performs two new works as well as excerpts from his tribute to Charlie Parker (July 3 to 7).
($10, various dates and times; 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, 212-242-0800, joyce.org.)
DISCOUNT DANCE
The Joyce offers more opportunities to see discounted dance at its branch tucked in among the atelier elite of SoHo. But this space is for independents and nonprofits only, like the New Dance Alliance, which is wrapping up its 26th Performance Mix Festival this weekend. Experimental movers include Smokinfantastic, a k a Bobbi Williams, an interdisciplinary circus, burlesque and dance artist who performs on Saturday, March 17 at 7 p.m. Others, from Poland, Canada and the United States, will perform Sunday at 7 p.m. ($15) and Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. (free; first come first served). Sunday's $30 admission includes an after-party.
(155 Mercer Street, between Houston and Prince Streets; joyce.org, newdancealliance.org.)

HEADLINE: Ruling Gives Edge to U.S. In Its Appeal Of Citi Case

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
6:15 p.m. Updated with additional details
WASHINGTON - A federal appeals court dealt a stinging rebuke on Thursday to Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in New York, who last year rejected a Securities and Exchange Commission fraud settlement with Citigroup because the deal had allowed the company to avoid admitting any wrongdoing.
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, in a mostly procedural decision, ruled that the S.E.C. was likely to succeed in a full-blown appeal of Judge Rakoff's rejection of the commission's proposed $285 million settlement with Citigroup. The case centered on the bank's structuring and sale of mortgage-related investments prior to the financial crisis. 
Judge Rakoff has been critical of the S.E.C. in other decisions and has held up other tentative settlements that the S.E.C. had reached in recent years, including one with Bank of America over bonuses paid at its Merrill Lynch unit.
But the latest decision by the appeals court is significant for the S.E.C. as well as scores of other federal regulatory agencies, which have warned that if companies are forced to admit guilt in settling cases with regulators, enforcement actions would grind to a halt.
In an unsigned but unanimous decision, a three-judge appeals panel agreed. ''Requiring such an admission would in most cases undermine any chance for compromise,'' the court said.
The appeals court ruling puts off a trial between the S.E.C. and Citigroup that Judge Rakoff had scheduled for July. He did so after concluding that because the settlement failed to include any agreed-upon facts, the court was unable to judge whether the outcome was fair, adequate reasonable or in the public interest.
But the appeals court panel dismantled Judge Rakoff's logic and analysis, saying he had overstepped his judicial authority in rejecting an settlement by an agency of the executive branch. ''We have no reason to doubt the S.E.C.'s representation that the settlement it reached is in the public interest,'' the court said.
While noting that its opinion on the procedural points is not binding on a panel that will judge the merits of Judge Rakoff's arguments, the court nevertheless said, ''We are satisfied that the S.E.C. and Citigroup have made a strong showing of likelihood of success in setting aside the district court's rejection of their settlement.''
A different panel of appellate judges for the Second Circuit will hear arguments later this year on whether to overturn Judge Rakoff's rejection of the proposed settlement. A court-appointed lawyer will argue Judge Rakoff's point of view.
Judge Rakoff, who is sitting on the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit bench this week hearing cases, as district court judges often do, declined to comment because the case was still in court.
Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C.'s enforcement director, said the agency was pleased with the decision. ''As we have said consistently, we agree to settlements when the terms reflect what we reasonably believe we could obtain if we prevailed at trial, without the risk of delay and uncertainty that comes with litigation,'' Mr. Khuzami said in a statement. ''Equally important, this settlement approach preserves resources that we can use to stop other frauds and protect other victims.''
Citigroup, which sided with the S.E.C. against Judge Rakoff, also issued a statement saying it was pleased with the ruling.
Thomas O. Gorman, a law partner at Dorsey and Whitney in Washington and author of the blog S.E.C. Actions, called the ruling ''an important win for the S.E.C.'' and one that ''is somewhat harsh to Judge Rakoff.''
The appeals court's ruling ''is saying that the District Court has a role in the settlement process but it is very, very limited,'' Mr. Gorman explained. ''It makes it relatively clear that the court sees Judge Rakoff as second-guessing the S.E.C., and says that's not appropriate.''
The appeals court noted that Judge Rakoff's opinion prejudged the assertion that Citigroup misled investors, assumed that the S.E.C. would win a trial and discounted the possibility that Citigroup would refuse to settle the case if it had to admit liability.
Judge Rakoff's decision ''does not appear to have given deference to the S.E.C.'s judgment on wholly discretionary matters of policy,'' the appeals court said. ''It is not, however, the proper function of federal courts to dictate policy to executive administrative agencies.''
The unsigned opinion in the case, S.E.C. v. Citigroup Global Markets, came from Judges John M. Walker Jr., Pierre N. Leval and Rosemary S. Pooler.
Judge Rakoff's decision in the Citigroup case, released in November, created a stir in legal circles and made the judge a folk hero among consumer-advocacy groups. Federal judges in Brooklyn and Wisconsin cited the opinion in other cases involving the S.E.C., requesting additional information from the agency about its allegations before considering proposed settlements.
A federal judge in New Jersey also recently cited Judge Rakoff when considering a settlement proposed by the Federal Trade Commission.
Part of Judge Rakoff's decision focused on whether the settlement was serious enough to serve as a deterrent to repeated violations of the same securities laws. The multimillion dollar civil penalty agreed to by Citigroup was little more than ''pocket change'' for the company, Judge Rakoff said, and gained the S.E.C. nothing more from the settlement than ''a quick headline.''
Judge Rakoff also noted that the S.E.C. had not enforced the court injunction it was seeking - a ban on future violations of the same securities law - on any Wall Street firm in at least 10 years.
But the appeals court said: ''There is no indication in the record that the court in fact gave deference to the S.E.C.'s judgment on any of these questions.'' While that does not mean that a court must ''rubber stamp'' all settlements made by a federal agency, ''it does mean that a court should not reject the agency's assessment without substantial reason for doing so.''

ST. PATRICK'S DAY WEEKEND (Friday through Sunday) St. Patrick's Day on a weekend? For many, that's a lucky occurrence in itself, with freedom from school or work to go to the annual parade on Fifth Avenue. Like last year's, this year's parade in Manhattan will stretch from 44th to 79th Streets, beginning Saturday at 11 a.m. (Revelers at last year's event, above.) 
But it also means that people will have more time to take in other events. On Friday from 6 to 8 p.m., the New-York Historical Society, at Central Park West and 77th Street, will host an evening of music and historical displays about notable Irish citizens, including the former New York governor Alfred E. Smith. Beginning Saturday at noon, visitors to the Merchant's House Museum, on East Fourth Street, can learn about the Irish immigrants who once toiled in the home there, with tours of the recently renovated servants' quarters. And all weekend long, the food, politics and historic figures of the New York Irish -- the good and the bad -- will be covered on walking tours in Lower and Midtown Manhattan. Details for these events can be found in the Listings on this page. No need to party like there's no tomorrow; there's always Sunday brunch. (Anne Mancuso)

HEADLINE: House G.O.P. Hesitates On Birth Control Fight

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans, unsure how to proceed, have slowed their efforts to overturn a federal rule requiring employers, including religious institutions, to provide female employees with free health insurance coverage for contraceptives.
While most House Republicans still support legislation to broaden the exemption for religious employers, House Republican leaders are carefully reviewing their options on the issue, which Democrats used to political advantage in the Senate.
The goal of House Republicans has not changed, they said, but they worry about further alienating women in this year's elections. 
In a speech on the House floor on Feb. 8, Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, vowed to block the Obama administration rule because, he said, it would force many religious employers to violate their religious beliefs and moral convictions.
''This attack by the federal government on religious freedom in our country must not stand and will not stand,'' Mr. Boehner said then. The Energy and Commerce Committee is ''taking the lead'' in writing legislation to overturn the president's policy, Mr. Boehner said then.
On the same day, Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the committee, said, ''I plan to move quickly'' on legislation.
But five weeks later, no legislation is in sight. Aides to Mr. Upton said the decision about how to proceed was in the hands of the speaker.
''It's been kicked up to the leadership,'' a committee member said. ''They want a cooling-off period.''
Aides to the House Republican whip, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, said they detected no urgency in taking up legislation. A leadership aide said the speaker was taking ''a deliberative approach.''
Republicans in swing districts are particularly eager to defer votes, which they fear could be used to portray them as opponents of reproductive health care for women.
Representative Judy Biggert, Republican of Illinois, said, ''We should keep our focus on economic growth and jobs, instead of getting sidetracked by issues that divide us.''
Representative Tom Reed, Republican of New York, disagrees with the president's policy. But he said: ''We have clearly staked out our opposition to it. It's time to move on to other issues, like jobs and the economy.''
Republicans control the House schedule and could bring legislation to the floor at any time if they agreed on a proposal and saw political benefits in pressing the issue.
By a vote of 51 to 48, the Senate recently upheld President Obama's birth control policy and turned back Republican efforts to let employers and health insurance companies deny coverage for contraceptives and other items to which they object on religious or moral grounds.
Republican senators tried to frame the issue as a matter of conscience rather than contraception, while Democrats cited the proposal as evidence of a Republican war against women -- a theme echoed on the Senate floor on Thursday as Democrats urged swift passage of a separate bill to fight domestic violence.
The 12 Democratic women in the Senate tried to turn up the heat on Mr. Boehner. In a letter, they asked him to ''abandon the promise'' he had made to bring legislation to the House floor overriding Mr. Obama's birth control policy. In a Twitter message on Thursday, Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, invited Americans to sign an online petition urging the speaker to ''stop the attacks on women and birth control.''
Several House Republicans, mindful of the political risks, said that Roman Catholic bishops needed to do more to educate and mobilize the public.
In the latest New York Times/CBS News poll, 57 percent of Americans said that religiously affiliated employers, like universities and hospitals, should be allowed to opt out of the requirement to cover birth control if they had religious or moral objections. The telephone poll was conducted March 7 to 11 with 1,009 adults nationwide.
''Americans inherently support the notion that the federal government should respect the right to religious freedom,'' said Kevin Smith, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner. ''Democrats have tried mightily to make this issue something it's not, but they overlook the millions of Americans whose religious beliefs are not susceptible to Washington spin.''
The White House and Mr. Obama's re-election campaign see the fight as an opportunity to court women and to build support for the new health care law, on which public opinion remains deeply divided.
At least 28 states have laws requiring insurers to cover birth control. Twenty of them allow some employers and insurers to opt out. Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group, said the exemptions in about half of those states were narrower than those allowed by Mr. Obama, while in the rest the exemptions were broader.

The ouster of Bo Xilai, the Communist Party secretary of Chongqing municipality who was openly campaigning for a spot in China's elite leadership, is raising concerns of unsettling conflict within the Party.

HEADLINE: On Stump in Ohio, Biden Attacks G.O.P. Rivals

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH; Mark Landler contributed reporting from Largo, Md.

 BODY:
TOLEDO, Ohio -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the White House's preferred emissary to the Rust Belt, swept into his political sweet zone on Thursday, touting the administration's economic record to a spirited gathering at the United Auto Workers Local 12 hall. He talked up the American auto industry, praised President Obama's convictions and criticized the Republican presidential candidates by name -- repeatedly -- accusing them of being ''about protecting the privileged sector.''
''I am laying out a clear and stark difference between us and our opponents,'' Mr. Biden said before a friendly crowd of about 500, many of them employees of a Jeep plant, among this northwest Ohio city's biggest employers. 
Mr. Biden's drop-in to this electorally vital area was billed as a first salvo in a more formal phase of the 2012 presidential campaign. While the re-election effort started months ago -- with both Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden appearing at multiple fund-raisers and campaignlike events -- the vice president's visit here was the first stump stop that the White House called an official campaign event. Mr. Obama was speaking at the same time in Maryland, defending his energy policies at a rally in often spirited and sometimes sarcastic tones against unnamed Republicans who are promising to bring down gas prices.
Mr. Obama said criticism of him -- from people ''who are running for a certain office'' -- revealed a streak of ignorance similar to those who predicted that cars would not supplant horse-drawn buggies or that television would never elbow out radio.
''If some of these folks were around when Columbus set sail, they must have been founding members of the Flat Earth Society,'' Mr. Obama said to a cheering crowd at Prince George's Community College.
But Mr. Biden was more pronounced in his derision of their would-be opponents in the fall. It was perhaps a preview of the hard-hitting tones that the re-election campaign is expected to strike in coming months -- with Mr. Biden taking the more aggressive tack to allow the president to remain a bit more presidential.
The vice president's rally here had all the trappings of the stump settings where the extroverted deputy is unquestionably at home -- 2012 signs (with the zero forming the Obama ''O''), campaign buttons and a lectern decked out in a big flag and an ''economy built to last'' placard. Before his speech, some scattered cries of the 2008's rallying mantra -- ''fired up, ready to go'' -- emanated from pockets of the T-shirted crowd.
Mr. Biden's language was also more nakedly political than his typical vice-presidential speeches. It included explicit denunciations of the remaining Republican candidates -- Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and particularly Mitt Romney, who the White House still views as its more likely and formidable challenger in the fall.
''Stated simply, we're about promoting the private sector; they're about protecting the privileged sector,'' Mr. Biden said. ''We're a fair shot, and a fair shake. They're about no rules, no risk and no accountability.''
For months, Republicans have portrayed the administration as big daddies of bailouts, handouts and entitlements. Speaking in Toledo, home of a Jeep plant and sixty miles from Detroit, Mr. Biden said the administration's decision to support the embattled auto industry in 2009 was correct, despite opposition from many Republicans -- namely Mr. Romney, who suggested that Detroit might have been better off had automakers been left to navigate their way through bankruptcy without any government help.
''The verdict is in,'' Mr. Biden said. ''President Obama was right, and they were dead wrong.''
The vice president pounded away, chiding Republicans for their assertions that the private sector could have provided the auto industry with the money it needed to get back to stability. ''In 2009, nobody was lining up to lend money to General Motors, or lend money to anyone,'' Mr. Biden said. ''That includes Bain Capital,'' he added, a crack at the private equity firm where Mr. Romney spent his formative professional years.
It was those red-meat lines, singling out the opposition, that most delighted the crowd. When Mr. Biden said Mr. Santorum had dismissed the administration's support of the auto industry as ''a payoff to special interests,'' one man in the back shouted out with a sarcastic refrain, ''Special interests, working people.''
When Mr. Biden contended that ''Gingrich, Romney and Santorum, they don't let the facts get in the way,'' he was buoyed by a chorus of boos. ''Ready to rumble,'' called out a man in a U.A.W. shirt. ''You tell 'em.''
Toledo was the first of four campaign stops for the vice president in crucial states over the next month. He is expected to visit Florida next week, another destination that is familiar turf for the ever-tanned Mr. Biden, who has a long history of support from the state's many Jewish voters, some of whom say the administration is not committed enough to the security of Israel.
Mr. Biden is clearly at home in the classic retail political settings of blue-collar America. Unlike his boss -- and, for that matter, Mr. Romney -- no one accuses Mr. Biden of being distant, professorial or someone who struggles to ''connect.''
''I always felt he was a carefree guy, someone we could relate to'' said Mike Kaminsky, a retired U.A.W. member who spent 25 years at Jeep in Toledo.
After leaving the union hall rally, Mr. Biden detoured to a local Chrysler parts complex, where he greeted workers during a midafternoon shift change. He slipped off his navy blue suit coat and immediately affirmed his working-class credentials. ''I am union and U.A.W.,'' the vice president declared, ''from belt buckle to shoe soles.''

Previews and Openings
'The Big Meal' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) In what sounds like a modern-day take on Thornton Wilder, this new play traverses 80 years and five generations in the life of a typical suburban family. The director, Sam Gold, has found plenty of poetry in Annie Baker's forays into suburbia; let's see if he'll do the same for Dan LeFranc (''Sixty Miles to Silver Lake''). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com, playwrightshorizons.org. (Eric Grode) 
'End of the Rainbow' (previews start on Monday; opens on April 2) Transferring from a hit London run and a pre-Broadway engagement at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Peter Quilter's bio-play with songs chronicles the 1968 comeback attempt of an addled Judy Garland, channeled here in an acclaimed performance by Tracie Bennett. Directed by Terry Johnson (who staged the recent revival of ''La Cage aux Folles''), the production also stars Michael Cumpsty. Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, endoftherainbowbroadway.com. (David Rooney)
'Evita' (in previews; opens on April 5) One of the defining musicals of its era, Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's 1978 Eva Peron bio-drama returns in its first Broadway revival, with the Argentine actress Elena Roger reprising the star turn that earned her kudos in London. (Hopefully, she will erase all memories of Madonna in the role.) Flanking her in Michael Grandage's production are Michael Cerveris as Juan Peron, and Ricky Martin, swapping la vida loca for that of the show's enigmatic narrator, Che. Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, entrance on West 46th Street, between Broadway and Eighth Avenue, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (David Rooney)
'Ghost: The Musical' (in previews; opens on April 23) Yes, there's a new score by Dave Stewart (formerly half of the Eurythmics) and Glen Ballard (a key collaborator of Alanis Morissette and Michael Jackson). But fret not, you won't be denied hearing the Righteous Brothers hit ''Unchained Melody,'' which had women flocking to pottery classes when the smash 1990 movie was released. Bruce Joel Rubin has adapted his Oscar-winning screenplay for the stage, with Matthew Warchus directing the afterlife love story. Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (David Rooney)
'Gore Vidal's The Best Man' (in previews; opens on April 1) How will the ruthless chicanery of Mr. Vidal's 1960 play about the presidential primary season measure up against its real-life contemporary counterpart? Quite well if the top-notch cast assembled for Michael Wilson's Broadway revival is any indication. That lineup includes James Earl Jones, John Larroquette, Candice Bergen, Angela Lansbury, Eric McCormack, Kerry Butler, Jefferson Mays and Michael McKean. Gerald Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney)
'Jesus Christ Superstar' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's mildly revisionist rock gloss on the Gospels began life as a concept album, a format that the director Des McAnuff knows something about. (He won a Tony for guiding the Who's ''Tommy'' to the stage.) This production earned its share of hosanna hey-sannas at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Canada, where Mr. McAnuff is artistic director. Most of the Stratford cast has remained for the Broadway production, including Josh Young as Judas and Paul Nolan as the title character. Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Eric Grode)
'Lost in Yonkers' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Neil Simon got a raw deal when David Cromer's sensitive 2009 revival of ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' closed after only a week and its planned companion piece, ''Broadway Bound,'' never made it out of the rehearsal room. TACT/The Actors Company Theater attempts to repair the playwright's reputation with this intimate production, directed by Jenn Thompson, of the 1991 Pulitzer and Tony winner widely ranked among his finest work. Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Lucky Duck' (opens on Friday) From the Coterie Theater in Kansas City, Mo., comes this staging of the pop-soul musical spin on ''The Ugly Duckling'' by the composer Henry Krieger (''Dreamgirls'') and his lyricist collaborator on ''Side Show,'' Bill Russell, who wrote the book with the playwright Jeffrey Hatcher. New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 562-2200, newvictory.org. (David Rooney)
'Magic/Bird' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on April 11) After teaming up for the football-themed ''Lombardi,'' the playwright Eric Simonson and the director Thomas Kail continue to mine sports for drama in this NBA-backed account of the rivalry between Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, which captivated basketball fans and yielded one of the most famous friendships in professional sports. Kevin Daniels and Tug Coker play the hoop stars. Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney)
'A Moon for the Misbegotten' (in previews; opens on Sunday) The Pearl Theater adds to the flurry of Eugene O'Neill productions appearing around town this winter with J. R. Sullivan's staging of the playwright's late masterwork. Kim Martin-Cotten and Andrew May make their Pearl debuts in the central roles of Josie Hogan and James Tyrone. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (David Rooney)
'The Morini Strad' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on April 3) Casey Childs directs the New York premiere of this play by Willy Holtzman, inspired by the true story of the concert violinist Erica Morini and her beloved Stradivarius. The cast of this Primary Stages production includes Michael Laurence, Mary Beth Peil and the violin soloist Hanah Stuart. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (David Rooney)
'Newsies' (in previews; opens on March 29) Inspired by the Newsboy Strike of 1899, when underpaid teenage New York City newspaper sellers took on the media barons of the day, this stage adaptation of the 1992 movie was originally conceived by Disney as a regional and touring property. But response to the premiere last fall at New Jersey's Paper Mill Playhouse was so rousing that a limited Broadway engagement was planned for Jeff Calhoun's energetic production, which stars Jeremy Jordan, late of ''Bonnie & Clyde.'' Songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman, with a book by Harvey Fierstein. Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (David Rooney)
'No Place to Go' (in previews; opens on Wednesday) Oskar Eustis, artistic director of the Public Theater, describes Ethan Lipton as ''a fantastic amalgam of Woody Guthrie and Woody Allen.'' The first original commission for Joe's Pub, this show is Mr. Lipton's musical ode to the unemployed, framed as a personal protest when the company where he has worked for the past 10 years moves to another planet. Leigh Silverman directs. Joe's Pub at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (David Rooney)
'Now. Here. This.' (in previews; opens on March 28) The creators, cast and director-choreographer behind ''[title of show]'' reunite on this humorous exploration of life's big questions, with a gaze that extends from early man to ancient civilizations to middle school to outer space. Following a developmental workshop last year, the musical returns to the Vineyard for a fully staged production. Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, (212) 353-0303, vineyardtheatre.org. (David Rooney)
'Once' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Off Broadway transfers to Broadway are nothing new, and neither are musicals based on successful films, but this is a rare case of both happening at the same time. The scruffy 2006 romance about an Irish busker and a Czech immigrant bonding over music in Dublin has become a musical with the help of the movie's stars, Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova (who wrote the music and lyrics), as well as John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (who also directed and choreographed ''Black Watch,'' respectively). Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti star in the central roles. Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Eric Grode)
'A (radically condensed and expanded) Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again (after David Foster Wallace)' (opens on Thursday) The title says it all. Admirers of the deceased author will debate whether his wry cultural observations were at their sharpest in his novels, short stories or essays. The director Daniel Fish has chosen Wallace's 1997 nonfiction collection to assemble a portrait of the writer, mixed live using his audio recordings and an ensemble of six performers. Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org. (David Rooney)
'Regrets' (in previews; opens on March 27) The British playwright Matt Charman makes his New York debut with this Manhattan Theater Club production, directed by Carolyn Cantor. A drama about friendship and courage, the 1950s-set play centers on a young man who flees Hollywood and heads to a Nevada desert retreat where men go to secure a quickie divorce. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (David Rooney)
'The Taming of the Shrew' (previews start on Sunday; opens on April 1) Maggie Siff (''Mad Men'') and Andy Grotelueschen lead the cast as the brawling lovebirds Kate and Petruchio in Arin Arbus's post-feminist take on sexual politics according to Shakespeare. The director returns to Theater for a New Audience, where she previously staged acclaimed productions of ''Othello'' and ''Measure for Measure.'' The Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, dukeon42.org. (David Rooney)
'That Beautiful Laugh' (opens on Friday) This inaugural production from the Artigiani Troupe stars Alan Tudyk (currently appearing on the ABC series ''Suburgatory'') in a high-energy clown show conceived and directed by Orlando Pabotov, inspired by the nightly bedtime ritual of improvised stories for his 5-year-old son. The musician Harrison Beck accompanies the cast on accordion and vocals. The Club at LaMaMa, 74A East Fourth Street, between Second Avenue and the Bowery, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (David Rooney)
Broadway
- 'Anything Goes' Kathleen Marshall's zesty revival of Cole Porter's hit-packed musical embodies the essence of escapist entertainment in the 1930s, when hard times called for bold smiles, tough wisecracks and flashy fantasies. Sutton Foster is sensational as the nightclub evangelist Reno Sweeney (2:30). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
- 'The Book of Mormon' This delightful collaboration between the creators of ''South Park'' (Trey Parker and Matt Stone) and the composer of ''Avenue Q'' (Robert Lopez) is blasphemous, scurrilous and as pure-hearted as a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. No musical has so successfully had it both ways since ''The Producers.'' Casey Nicholaw is the witty co-director (with Mr. Parker) and choreographer (2:15). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
'The Gershwins' Porgy and Bess' As the fatally conflicted Bess, the extraordinary Audra McDonald is a gale force of emotion in Diane Paulus's slimmed-down musical adaptation of the landmark 1935 opera. Otherwise, despite a likable performance from Norm Lewis as Porgy, this production feels cloudy and mild, only rarely acquiring the majesty of the opera that inspired it (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Godspell' Oh, dear Lord: the beloved 1971 musical that turned biblical parables into teachable moments has been stuffed fruitcake-full of jokey contemporary allusions. Performed by a peppy young cast, the show is like being stuck in a rec room with kids who have been too reckless with the Red Bull (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying' Nick Jonas plays the amoral hero of Frank Loesser's 1961 musical about corporate ladder-climbing. Rob Ashford directed this largely charm-free revival (2:40). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
- 'Other Desert Cities' Jon Robin Baitz's family drama is so good that you may not even realize how good it is while you're watching it. Joe Mantello directs a sublime cast that expertly elicits the pain and the comfort of blood ties (2:00). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' The 1994 movie about Australian drag queens in the outback becomes a hyperactively splashy karaoke musical so desperate to show the audience a gaudy good time that the results are mostly enervating. Tony Sheldon brings some warmth as the transsexual Bernadette, but the show is mostly a riot of spangles, sequins and silly costumes (2:30). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Seminar' Alan Rickman is a virtuoso of disdain in Theresa Rebeck's shiny, facile comedy about an ego-shredding writing teacher. Full of efficiently mapped reversals, the play feels as if it were written according to the literary equivalent of a GPS device. Sam Gold directs a bright cast that includes Lily Rabe and Hamish Linklater (1:40). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Sister Act' When the good sisters of the Church of Philly Soul are rocking to raise the Gothic rafters, led by the radiant Patina Miller, all is right with this stage adaptation of the hit movie about a club singer hiding out as a nun. Otherwise, this story of a bad girl teaching some good ones how to get down is innocuous but generic musical theater (2:30). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark' This retooled mega-expensive musical is no longer an ungodly, indecipherable mess. It's just a bore. Recommended for less-than-precocious children with a hundred dollars to burn (2:45). Foxwoods Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (800) 745-3000, spidermanonbroadway.marvel.com. (Ben Brantley)
- 'Venus in Fur' The incandescent Nina Arianda recreates her dazzling turn as an actress auditioning for the role of a 19th-century dominatrix in David Ives's seriously funny sex comedy about power games at an audition. Hugh Dancy holds his own as the writer-director who may be discovering more than he wants to know about the destabilizing nature of desire (1:45). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'War Horse' This imported British weepie, adapted from Michael Morpurgo's children's book about a cavalry horse in World War I, has the most charismatic matinee idol seen in ages: that's Joey, the title character, a puppet brought to life-size life with ineffably theatrical magic (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
Off Broadway
'All Hands' Hoi Polloi's new work, a creative take on secret societies with bursts of inspiration, mixes rock opera with experimental theater (1:40). Incubator Arts Project, inside St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, incubatorarts.org. (Jason Zinoman)
- 'And God Created Great Whales' Rinde Eckert's deeply sentimental, affecting and often funny portrait of an artist -- an opera composer -- in search of his own, rapidly deteriorating memory. Directed by David Schweizer and also starring Nora Cole, this revival of Mr. Eckert's 2000 performance piece uses music, flashcards and ''Moby-Dick'' in a fight against eroding time (1:20). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org. (Ben Brantley)
'The Berenstain Bears Live! In Family Matters, the Musical' The most famous bears since the three in the Goldilocks story are onstage in this adaptation of three of the titles in the long-running children's book series by Stan and Jan Berenstain. The show, by Michael Borton and Michael Slade, offers a pleasant hour for small theatergoers, with a pop-flavored score and actors who inhabit their fuzzy roles enthusiastically. But like the books, it's rather tame and tidy; after this many years of a formula, even the Berenstain cubs are starting to show their age. Saturday and Sunday only (:55). Marjorie S. Deane Little Theater, 5 West 63rd Street, (866) 811-4111, berenstainbearslive.com. (Laurel Graeber)
'Beyond the Horizon' Eugene O'Neill's bleak 1920 drama, a tale of two brothers beaten up by bad choices and bad karma, has been given a dutiful revival by the Irish Repertory Theater. Directed by Ciaran O'Reilly, this is a one-foot-in-front-of-the-other march into a grim destiny that even Thomas Hardy might have deemed excessive (2:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Ben Brantley)
'Carrie' This exceedingly sober revival of a fabled flop musical from the 1980s, based on Stephen King's classic horrors-of-high-school novel, is as minimal and subdued as a little black choir robe, which means that it isn't much fun. Molly Ranson is a tad too sane as the vengeful Carrie, but Marin Mazzie is very good as her demented mother (2:15). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Ben Brantley)
'Deep Are the Roots' About the homecoming of a black soldier to the South after World War II, this play by Arnaud d'Usseau and James Gow lacks the immediacy it must have had in 1945, when it was first staged. It's not a great play, but it's an interesting one and the Metropolitan Playhouse production has a pulpy propulsion (2:40). Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302, metropolitanplayhouse.org. (Rachel Saltz)
'The Devil's Music: The Life and Blues of Bessie Smith' Miche Braden plays the bawdy-talking, hooch-swilling Bessie Smith in this show that mixes Smith's songs with talk about her life, loves and career. That format seems a bit tired, but Ms. Braden gives it her all (1:20). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
'Dona Flor y Sus Dos Maridos' A Spanish-language adaptation (''Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands,'' in English) of Jorge Amado's novel, a sex farce with the clarity and logic of a folk tale and the spirit of a party. (1:40). Repertorio Espanol at Gramercy Arts Theater, 138 East 27th Street, (212) 225-9920, repertorioespanol.com. (Rachel Saltz)
- 'Edward Albee's The Lady From Dubuque' Edward Albee throws a mean party in this scintillating revival of a much-maligned play, in which death comes to call wearing pearls. David Esbjornson directs a crackerjack cast that includes Michael Hayden, Laila Robins and, in the title role, a serenely commanding Jane Alexander (2:00). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Ben Brantley)
'Eternal Equinox' The Bloomsbury group giveth, and it taketh away: Joyce Hokin Sach's imagining of a fraught night among members of this early 20th-century British tribe is pleasing and at times engrossing. But it never meets the very high bar set by its historical source material (1:50). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan; (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Claudia La Rocco)
'Flight' This implausible play follows a man searching for his past as his mother suffers from dementia (1:25). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200, dr2theatre.com. (Ken Jaworowski)
- 'Gatz' Elevator Repair Service's word-for-word presentation of ''--The Great Gatsby''-- -- resuming on Wednesday -- chronicles one reader's seduction by a single, ravishing novel. The astonishing Scott Shepherd is the reader, a bored employee in a shabby office, and a first-rate ensemble embodies both his fellow workers and the characters he brings to life. John Collins directed this work of rare imagination and intelligence (6:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555 , publictheater.org. (Ben Brantley)
'Hand to God' The Devil is a sock puppet in the return of this foul-mouthed, fun-packed play by Robert Askins about the urges that drive good men (and women, and boys) to dirty deeds. Exuberantly performed by a great cast, led by Steven Boyer as a troubled teenager at odds with his id (1:45). Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Him' The merits of this bonbon (written and directed by the onetime glittering New York talent manager and social operator Clifford Streit) about a gay couple almost undone by the Hollywood closet are so abundant that it's painful when you realize the malicious disdain the play has for women (1:10). Soho Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, (212) 691-1555, sohoplayhouse.com. (Andy Webster)
'Hindsight' An older woman and a younger woman meet on a Paris park bench; it turns out they know each other all too well. Simon Van Booy's occasional winning bons mots and shrewd observations are drowned out by a weirdly tentative production that quickly runs aground (1:40). Drilling Company Theater, 236 West 78th Street, Manhattan, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Eric Grode)
'Hurt Village' Katori Hall's sprawling, overstuffed play, about the last days of a Memphis housing project, may have its problems. But it's packed with vitality and infused with the locomotive rhythms of rap. Patricia McGregor directs a vivid cast that includes the formidable Tonya Pinkins as the determined matriarch of a fragmented family (2:40). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Ben Brantley)
'An Iliad' Denis O'Hare and Stephen Spinella alternate in this solo adaptation of the Homer epic about the Trojan War. The text, by Mr. O'Hare and the show's director, Lisa Peterson, blends small selections from Robert Fagles's translation with larger expanses of vernacular language (1:40). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com, nytw.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Look Back in Anger' Sam Gold's stylized staging of John Osborne's 1956 drama about a working-class lad with the weight of a stifling social system on his shoulders wins points for ingenuity -- the stage is about three feet deep -- but in the crucial central role, Matthew Rhys (television's ''Brothers and Sisters'') never locates the genuine pain beneath the surface rage (2:10). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 352-3101, roundabouttheatre.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Painting Churches' Kathleen Chalfant and John Cunningham are ideal interpreters of the fading Boston blue bloods at the center of Tina Howe's 1983 family portrait, their patrician airs masking fear and fragility. But as the artist daughter who arrives from New York to paint their portrait and help the elderly couple pack up their lives for a move necessitated by failing health and diminished means, Kate Turnbull is outclassed. The same goes for the director Carl Forsman in a pedestrian revival that smudges the subtleties of Ms. Howe's delicate play (2:10). Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (David Rooney)
'Rated P for Parenthood' Half of the time, Sandy Rustin, Dan Lipton and David Rossmer's musical about the joys and trials of having children is touching and wistfully funny. The rest of the time, it offers nothing more than we're-all-alike platitudes, shakily conveyed (1:25). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Rent' Maybe they should call it ''Sublet.'' The young cast members who inhabit this premature revival of Jonathan Larson's watershed rock opera from 1996, directed by Michael Greif, never seem to feel truly at home. It is as if they're reluctant to make this show their own (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Russian Transport' Janeane Garofalo plays it straight, more or less, in Erika Sheffer's dark drama about the corrupting influence of a new Russian immigrant (the excellent Morgan Spector) on a Brooklyn family (2:10). Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Rutherford & Son' The Mint Theater revives Githa Sowerby's grimly unsentimental 1912 drama about John Rutherford, the owner of a glassworks in northern England, and the misery he has wrought on his children's lives. Directed by Richard Corley, this production remains a static and slightly musty affair (2:30). Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Rachel Saltz)
'Silence! The Musical' A silly, coarse musical spin on ''The Silence of the Lambs'' as pitched to obsessive fans (1:30). 9th Space Theater at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101, silencethemusical.com. (Jason Zinoman)
'Sistas: The Musical' The script is obvious, covering virtually every issue that might touch the lives of black women, but Dorothy Marcic's good-natured, low-budget musical is all about the songs. From ''Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do'' to ''Single Ladies,'' you could do a lot worse (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Sleep No More' Punchdrunk, a British site-specific theater company, has taken over three abandoned warehouses to enact the sorry sights of the murderous Macbeths' career as a movable orgy. The result suggests what might have happened if Stanley Kubrick (of ''The Shining'') had designed the Haunted Mansion at Disney World (2:00). The McKittrick Hotel, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, sleepnomorenyc.com. (Ben Brantley)
' 'Tis Pity She's a Whore' (opens on Tuesday) Britain's Cheek by Jowl company puts its vigorous performance stamp on John Ford's violent and bloody Jacobean tragedy of incestuous love in this production directed by Declan Donnellan and designed by Nick Ormerod. Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (David Rooney)
'Traces' An energizing evening of acrobatics from the Montreal troupe Seven Fingers. Think of it as cirque du cabaret, in which a group of distinctive talents gets to show off the physical equivalents of individual song stylings (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
- 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Voca People' This show features space aliens, but it's really all about a cappella music. The visitors have crash-landed on Earth in a ship powered by music, and lots of singing must be done to refuel their ship. The eight singers sound pretty good, but most of the show consists of fragments of songs, which becomes annoying; only when the cast is allowed to cut loose and deliver an entire song -- the Doors' ''People Are Strange'' is a highlight -- do things reach their full potential (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
Off Off Broadway
- 'Disaster!' This delightful jukebox musical, a mash-up of disaster-movie cliches from the 1970s and that decade's cheesiest pop hits (and there were so many), could have been D.J.'d by Irwin Allen. If you belong to its target demographic -- that is, you spent the '70s at the drive-in and listening to Casey Kasem's ''American Top 40'' -- it's irresistible. Sunday only (2:00). The Triad, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 362-2590, disastermusical.com. (Andy Webster)
'Growing Up Gonzales' This one-man play about a Nuyorican family in the 1970s is part stand-up, part melodrama and part cultural tourism. Andres Chulisi Rodriguez alternates between playing two brothers: Cisco, the sweet-natured, slow younger brother, who we learn at the outset has recently died; and Johnny, the thuggish older sibling, who has discovered Cisco's journals after his brother's death. The quiet Cisco, it turns out, was quite the storyteller and has colorfully recreated the tragedies and farces of their fatherless childhood, including ridiculous stories about shoplifting raw chickens and imitating Bruce Lee (1:30). Jan Hus Playhouse, 351 East 74th Street, (212) 811-4111, growingupgonzales.com. (Catherine Rampell)
- 'The Kreutzer Sonata' This adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's novella throws us into close quarters with a single, elegant speaker (a very fine Hilton McRae) who proceeds to eviscerate himself to the chugging rhythms of a train. Nancy Harris's script, directed by Natalie Abrahami, may be closer to Maugham than to Tolstoy, but it's still a mesmerizing monodrama (1:15). La MaMa, First Floor Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (Ben Brantley)
'Mama, I Want to Sing' A largely new cast (seeded from the Gospel for Teens program in Harlem) gives full-throated life to this long-running gospel musical. Quibbles about the thin plot and questionable acting go out the window with each and every tune -- and there are plenty of them. Saturday only (2:00). The Dempsey Theater, 127 West 127th Street, Harlem, (212) 868-4444, mamafoundation.org. (Eric Grode)
'That Ain't No Lady' The doyenne of New York's now-defunct annual outdoor drag festival, Wigstock, Lady Bunny purveys bawdy stand-up and pornographic pop song parodies in her first new cabaret act in 10 years. Looking like Dusty Springfield on steroids and introduced ''direct from the Port Authority men's room,'' the Lady and her show are definitely not for the prudish. But anyone feeling nostalgic for the seedy old days before Times Square became a tourist-friendly theme park will get a kick out of this evening of big hair and bad manners. Tuesday only (1:30). La Escuelita Cabaret Theater, 301 West 39th Street, (212) 631-0588, brownpapertickets.com. (David Rooney)

Last Chance
- 'The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs' (closes on Sunday) The accomplished monologuist Mike Daisey weaves the story of the Apple co-founder's life and vision into a darker exploration of the troubling economic disparities that underlie our technology-obsessed age. Smart, engaging and funny, but be warned that you might have second thoughts about purchasing that next shiny gadget (1:50). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'Be Careful! the Sharks Will Eat You!' (closes on Sunday) In his one-man show, Jay Alvarez recounts his family's escape from Cuba in 1964, when he was just 4. Acting at least a half-dozen roles, Mr. Alvarez is an evocative tale-teller when reliving the yearlong plans his father made that delivered as many as 30 refugees by boat to the United States. Despite the title, though, and to the play's disadvantage, he describes almost nothing of the 30-hour voyage itself (1:30). Stage Left Studio, 214 West 30th Street, stageleftstudio.net. (Daniel M. Gold)
'Galileo' (closes on Sunday) F. Murray Abraham gives a commanding but nuanced performance in Brian Kulick's lucid revival of Bertolt Brecht's drama about the conflict between scientific advance and the Roman Catholic Church in 17th-century Italy. But Brecht the lecturer sometimes peeks through the play's textured fabric (2:15). Classic Stage Company, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, classicstage.org. (Charles Isherwood)
'The Greenwich Village Follies' (starts winter hiatus after Sunday's performance) Doug Silver and Andrew Frank's musical revue about the history of the Village is enthusiastically played and has a few nice numbers, but it feels slapdash and not nearly polished enough to pay proper tribute to its dynamic neighborhood. Sunday only (1:20). Manhattan Theater Source, 177 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, thegreenwichvillagefollies.com. (Anita Gates)
'Hot Lunch Apostles' (closes on Sunday) Paul Zimet's revival of Sidney Goldfarb's 1983 play about a (really) down-and-out burlesque troupe in (really) hard times, brings to mind the transgressive theater of the 1960s, when getting naked and talking dirty felt newly liberating. For all its raunch 'n' roll, it has the feeling of warmed-up leftovers (1:40). Ellen Stewart Theater at La MaMa, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (Ben Brantley)
'I Alice I' (closes on Saturday) A captivating exercise in pseudodocumentary theater, this two-character play written and staged by Amy Conroy comes direct from an engagement at Dublin's Abbey Theater. Its structural conceit is that two fictional middle-aged women, both named Alice, were caught sneaking a kiss in a local supermarket by a theater artist who has coaxed them to share the story of their 30-year relationship. Ms. Conroy and Clare Barrett play the Alices as stage neophytes gripped by nerves and by the lifelong belief that their personal world was best kept private. Yet as they open up over tea and cake, sharing humorous and affecting insights both ordinary and precious, they become quietly empowered by their newfound visibility (1:10). Irish Arts Center, 553 West 51st Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, irishartscenter.org. (David Rooney)
'Make Mine Manhattan' (closes on Saturday) Dimpled and full-skirted, this sweet little musical revue from 1948 has soft-shoed its way into the Connelly Theater and banished all of the city's ugliness to Hoboken, N.J. Almost every song is a valentine, dedicated either to Manhattan or to some nameless stranger spotted across the park, and sometimes both (1:15). Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Catherine Rampell)
- 'Wit' (closes on Saturday) Cynthia Nixon gives a large, lucid and delicate performance in this immaculately staged (and inevitably moving) revival of Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize-winning drama from 1998 about a terminally ill English professor. Lynne Meadow's smart and sensitive production magnifies the play's innate theatricality without compromising the hard emotional truth at its center (1:40). Samuel J. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Ben Brantley)

HEADLINE: A Village Where Europe Can Take a Stroll and Plot Its Future

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Victor Homola contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MESEBERG, Germany -- Under Communism, the lakeside 18th-century Baroque palace in this village in the state of Brandenburg housed nine families upstairs and a branch of the East German general store known simply as Konsum downstairs.
After a multimillion-dollar renovation several years ago, the castle now serves as Chancellor Angela Merkel's version of Camp David, the American presidential retreat. And as leaders deliberate over the path for the European Union, this village of 149 residents has become the unlikely scene of high-level confidential meetings about the future of Europe.
In late February, Ms. Merkel invited three prime ministers, Enda Kenny of Ireland, Petr Necas of the Czech Republic and Valdis Dombrovskis of Latvia, for a glass of wine and private dialogue. On the agenda was not only the bailout of Greece and other topical matters but also longer-term questions about how each saw the future of the Continent. 
The week before, she had gathered the leaders of Denmark, Estonia and the Netherlands for dinner at Meseberg. In January, it was Austria's chancellor, as well as the prime ministers of Portugal and Sweden, who sampled the German government's hospitality at the elegant palace, an hour's drive north of Berlin. As Ms. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said last month, ''The chancellor attaches great importance to coming together for once without a formal agenda to lead a dialogue about the future.''
As the leader of Europe's largest economy, the only country with the financial wherewithal to rescue indebted euro zone countries, Ms. Merkel has found that her power and influence have grown considerably over the course of the European crisis. Although she shuns grand gestures, she has gone much further behind the scenes in taking the initiative and growing into her role as the de facto leader of Europe.
In speech after speech, Ms. Merkel says that what Germany and the European Union need are ''more Europe, not less Europe.'' Analysts say this is more than just empty talk. ''In Meseberg, she is exploring with the others, 'How far are you willing to go?' and sketching out the German approach,'' said Ulrike Guerot, a senior research fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.
''The more-Europe argument is coming,'' Ms. Guerot said. ''The attitude is, 'We put billions on the table to fix it. We should get a project out of that.' ''
While France is absorbed with President Nicolas Sarkozy's tough re-election battle against his Socialist challenger, Francois Hollande, the German political class is engaged in serious discussion about how to deepen economic and political integration without running afoul of an electorate weary of crisis and bailout or a hawk-eyed German constitutional court.
Plans under discussion to shift more responsibility to Brussels include greater supervision of national budgets by the European Commission and coordination of tax policies. Ms. Merkel has also spoken out in favor of closer political union, to lend legitimacy to European institutions regularly accused of being undemocratic, which could be seen as hesitant steps toward federalism.
''There is a very strong feeling within the German political class that things will not remain the same once this is over,'' said Thomas Risse, professor of international relations at the Free University in Berlin. ''There's a clear consensus that the European Union is going to profoundly change after this and that one should go ahead with further integration, particularly economic integration.''
Hardly a day went by at the peak of the crisis without a motorcade taking an important leader like Mr. Sarkozy, Italy's technocratic prime minister, Mario Monti, or the chief of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, to the chancellery building in central Berlin. The recent discussions at Meseberg, however, were a page out of the playbook of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Ms. Merkel's political mentor, Professor Risse said. Mr. Kohl made sure to engage the bloc's smaller states before making proposals, winning their support or at least hearing them out so they did not feel steamrolled.
As the site of the government guesthouse, Meseberg is modeled after Petersberg, near Bonn, where Mr. Kohl hosted leaders like Mikhail S. Gorbachev in the years before German reunification and before Parliament returned permanently to Berlin in 1999.
Ms. Merkel might well have ended up visiting at Meseberg even if the Berlin Wall had never fallen. The East German government planned to renovate the dilapidated castle and turn it into a conference center for the Academy of Sciences, where Ms. Merkel, a physicist before entering politics, worked at the time. Instead the castle fell deeper into disrepair after ending up in the hands of the state of Brandenburg.
In 1995 it was purchased by the Messerschmitt Foundation, which was established by the aircraft manufacturer Willy Messerschmitt, who became synonymous with the Nazi warplanes he built, many with slave labor. The foundation, devoted to preserving historical landmarks, spent 11 years and more than $30 million renovating the stucco building, with its Ionic half-columns and high mansard roof.
The foundation agreed to lease the castle to the German government for 20 years, for a rent of one euro, and handed over the keys in 2007. That may have been a bargain for taxpayers, but the government then had to spend $17 million installing security and communications equipment. Local residents were initially dismayed that they were expected to help pay to repave the roads and for other upgrades.
The village was ''catapulted from the Middle Ages to modern times all at once,'' said Frank Stege, the administrative director for the larger region of Gransee that includes Meseberg, which meant that costs usually spread over years arrived all at once. Local officials prize the name recognition and image boost that come with being the home of the chancellor's guesthouse, but it is not always easy on the village.
''It can be pretty exhausting with everything being searched and checked,'' said Ulrike Koch, 22, who was on her way to visit her in-laws. On a recent visit, the streets of Meseberg were empty except for a tractor rolling past the front gates and two police officers guarding the entrance.
Of course, a location out of the spotlight of the capital city press corps is part of the appeal. Visiting dignitaries can stroll in the garden or, as President George W. Bush did on his visit in 2008, ride a mountain bike around Meseberg. The basement of the castle was once home to the kitchen of the local agricultural cooperative. Today it houses the chancellor's wine bar, with seats for 30 guests.
''By adding the living-room mentality to the meeting -- 'Come on down and spend some time with me in my home' -- it gives a sense of intimacy to them,'' said Jackson Janes, executive director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington.
For Ms. Merkel, who grew up less than an hour's drive away in Templin, Meseberg and its East German history also provide the opportunity to tell her own story. ''She can say, 'This is where Europe and the whole concept of building a bigger Europe comes from for me,' '' Mr. Janes said.

HEADLINE: Obama Defends Energy Policy, Hitting Back at Presidential Candidates

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
LARGO, Md. In what has become a weekly ritual, President Obama on Thursday defended his administration's energy policy, in the face of relentlessly rising gasoline prices, to an American public that believes he can do more to ease the pain at the pump.
Mr. Obama cycled through now-familiar themes, promoting his record of increased domestic oil and gas production; stricter fuel-efficiency standards for cars and trucks; and investments in alternative sources of energy, like biofuels, wind and solar power. The administration's energy policy has been the focus of many speeches the president has given in recent weeks. 
But on Thursday he delivered a notably sarcastic rebuttal to his Republican presidential challengers, particularly Newt Gingrich, who has promised, if elected, to bring down gas prices to $2.50 a gallon, and has ridiculed the president's talk of making fuel from algae.
Without naming Mr. Gingrich, Mr. Obama said these gibes by people ''who are running for a certain office'' revealed a streak of ignorance similar to those who predicted that cars would not supplant horse-drawn buggies or that television would never elbow out radio.
''If some of these folks were around when Columbus set sail, they must have been founding members of the Flat Earth Society,'' Mr. Obama said to a cheering crowd at Prince George's Community College here. ''They would not have believed the earth was round.''
Turning the spotlight on the remarks of his opponents may make sense because Mr. Obama's defense of his role in rising gas prices rests on an uncomfortable claim: he cannot do much about it. It was a theme he struck again on Thursday
''There's no silver bullet,'' the president declared. ''Anybody who tells you otherwise isn't really looking for a solution; they're trying to ride the political wave of the moment.''
In Maryland, the average price per gallon is $3.86, 6 cents higher than the national average and 16 cents higher than it was a week ago. At an Exxon station near where Mr. Obama was speaking, unleaded gas was selling for $4.49 a gallon, one of the highest rates in the state.
Recent polls have suggested that gas prices are hurting Mr. Obama, with many people saying he could do more to stem the increases. In a New York Times/CBS News poll published on Monday, the president's approval rating fell to 41 percent from 50 percent a month earlier, with 47 percent disapproving of his performance.
A senior administration official dismissed that poll as an outlier, but he acknowledged that gasoline prices would be a drag on Mr. Obama for the next few months. The White House is most concerned that high gas prices will hobble the still-fragile economic recovery.
On Monday, the White House issued a progress report that summarized its efforts to implement an ''all-of-the-above'' energy strategy. The report's highlights included the president's oft-repeated observation that domestic production of oil and natural gas has risen every year he has been in office, making the United States a net exporter of energy.
In his speech, Mr. Obama said the White House pushed for an extension of the payroll tax cut, in part because it anticipated that gas prices might go up a rationale that did not figure prominently in the administration's arguments last year for extending the tax cut.
Addressing critics who say the United States could meet its energy needs through more drilling, Mr. Obama said his administration had opened millions of acres in 23 states to drilling, as well as an offshore area in the Gulf of Mexico that could yield 400 million barrels of oil.
There are a few places, Mr. Obama noted with a smile, where he has not authorized drilling: the National Mall; the middle of Chesapeake Bay; or underneath the houses of the people in his audience. When politicians tell you, ''Drill, Baby, Drill,'' the president said to the crowd, answer, ''We're doing that. Tell me something new.''
The youthful audience responded with chants of ''Yes, we can'' and ''Four more years,'' though two people collapsed during Mr. Obama's remarks. The president reminded people to eat, if they knew they were going to be standing for a long time.

HEADLINE: A Shift in Focus, From Obama to Numbers

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Suddenly, it is all anyone in Republican politics can talk about: 1,144.
That magic number -- the delegates required to clinch the Republican presidential nomination -- has catapulted from war room obscurity to an all-consuming obsession in the Republican Party's race for the White House, which trudges on, agonizingly, state after state.
Candidates are openly discussing their tallies -- a clinical, in-the-weeds subject usually left to aides. Political pundits are poring over the figures, gaming out statistical probabilities. And members of the news media, never known as whizzes around the calculator, have become fixated on the math. 
In the process, a Republican nominating contest that was supposed to be dominated by a single topic -- the case against President Obama -- has instead been taken over by calculations of remaining opportunities for delegate accumulation, turning the nominating contest into something approaching a national tutorial in electoral arithmetic.
Even those who trumpet the importance of the numbers say that the campaigns' public preoccupation with them is an unhealthy distraction for Republicans that, should it drag on much longer, could damage the party's chances in a general election.
''If the G.O.P. race for the next six months becomes a completely tactical discussion about delegate counts and potential deals, then it crowds out the ability to communicate larger strategic messages that voters really want and need to hear from Republicans,'' said Mark McKinnon, who was a strategist for George W. Bush's campaigns.
No other candidate has become as swamped by the delegate message as Mitt Romney. His aides have sought to turn his hefty delegate lead -- he now has 495, or 43 percent of what he needs to secure the nomination, according to an estimate by The Associated Press -- into a political battering ram that knocks his biggest rivals, Rick Santorum (252 delegates so far) and Newt Gingrich (131 delegates), out of the race.
In a flurry of briefings and white papers, Mr. Romney's staff has repeatedly argued that it is all but statistically impossible for anyone but Mr. Romney to collect enough delegates to win the nomination (a claim his rivals dispute). A new memo from the Romney campaign describes a coming ''date of mathematical elimination'' for his rivals.
''The math,'' it posits, ''is simple.''
To the surprise of some political operatives, Mr. Romney himself has made talk of delegates an increasingly common subject on the trail -- an unexpected digression into the mechanics of a campaign. ''This is all about getting delegates,'' he said on Tuesday, as voters in Mississippi and Alabama headed to the polls. ''That's what it's all about.''
He has pointed to his ''very strong lead in delegates'' in a television interview and described Michigan and Arizona as ''big delegate gets.''
Mr. Gingrich and his aides are taking the opposite approach: using the delegate math to justify their role as potential spoilers. They argue that, through a small number of primary victories and second-place showings, Mr. Gingrich, working as a tag team with Mr. Santorum, can deny Mr. Romney the delegates needed. Then, the thinking goes, he can make a case for himself at the convention as the strongest Republican alternative to Mr. Obama.
For Mr. Romney, the focus on delegates is a potentially powerful weapon, with appeal to skeptical donors and undecided party leaders. As his lead grows, it allows him to issue a call for unity that seems to be grounded in data-crunched reality.
But as a campaign message, it has all the inspirational appeal of a pie-chart-filled PowerPoint presentation, inviting suggestions that he views his party's nomination as the cold-eyed collection of delegates, rather than a battle for the hearts of Republican voters.
Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster, who worked on Jon M. Huntsman Jr.'s campaign this year, offered Mr. Romney this advice: ''Let your smart operatives do the process stuff. You do the vision thing.''
The emphasis on delegates explains why Mr. Santorum and Mr. Romney are dedicating scarce campaign hours and dollars in Puerto Rico, with its relatively small number of delegates (23).
The media fascination with delegates threatens to crowd out coverage of meatier topics that are central to the campaign's larger messages. On television and Twitter, the political classes are arguing about delegate math, not unemployment or the candidates' plans for tax cuts or entitlement reform. ''It is taking up a lot of oxygen,'' Mr. Ayres said. Yes, he said, ''It is a very important part of the story.''
But he added, ''It's a mistake to get sucked into a mathematical discussion to the point where that's the only message that is being communicated.''

HEADLINE: Worried, Latino, and Much Desired by G.O.P.

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
PUEBLO, Colo. -- For many years, and multiple election cycles, Republicans talked about the growing Hispanic vote in America like moonstruck, misunderstood boys at a high school dance. They could not connect, despite believing that they shared much in common, especially with socially conservative, religious Hispanic voters who would one day realize how charming Republicans could be.
Now, with the Hispanic vote poised to become a deciding factor in several crucial swing states, Republican leaders think they have found a fresh approach -- an appeal to Hispanics' growing distress over the sluggish economic recovery -- and they are trying to woo people like Arnold L. Gallegos.
Mr. Gallegos has been a committed Democrat all his life, born and raised in this Southwest-tinged city two hours south of Denver. But as a struggling small-business owner, he said his politics are wavering. 
''I don't know what to think anymore,'' said Mr. Gallegos, 66, sitting in the one-room office of his company, a shuttle van service with six part-time employees.
George W. Bush won re-election in 2004 with 44 percent of the Hispanic vote, appreciably more than Republican candidates had drawn before. In 2008, President Obama won with the help of 67 percent of the Hispanic vote, which in 2010 was also credited with helping to save the Nevada seat of the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, against a spirited Tea Party opponent.
This year, it is expected to be even more important, especially as the Hispanic populations have risen substantially in several swing states -- places like Colorado and Nevada, where generations of political calculus are being transformed by this growing demographic group that is generally aligned with the Democrats.
The big question that could ripple through the swing-state belt is how strongly that Democratic alignment will hold this time -- and for the Republicans, whether the tough anti-immigrant talk that has often laced through this year's presidential primaries will create headwinds among Hispanic voters that will be tough to counter. Mr. Obama's support last time was less than some other Democratic presidential candidates received: President Bill Clinton in 1996 and Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 both had slightly stronger numbers.
''If it's only 60 percent, then states such as Colorado, Nevada and New Mexico are going to be in play; if it's 80 percent, he will probably win those states,'' said John J. Pitney Jr., a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College in California. ''A lot of it is going to depend on the state of the economy.''
Mr. Gallegos's shuttle service, which he founded a decade ago and financed with a mortgage on his house, survived the Great Recession. But if economic recovery is lifting all boats -- and Democratic hopes in the White House -- Mr. Gallegos has not seen it. Rising costs over the last two years, especially for fuel in recent months, he said, are now shaking things to their foundation.
He voted for Mr. Obama -- who visited this city of 106,000 people three times in 2008 -- but the best he can say about a vote this year to give the president four more years is a lukewarm ''probably.''
''Something has got to get better, and it's got to happen fast because I'm about at the end,'' Mr. Gallegos said.
Not even the most optimistic Republican is expecting a majority of Colorado's Hispanic vote to swing suddenly to the red side of the ballot in November. The historic links, especially strong in this blue-collar industrial city of steel-making and railroads, are still there. Statewide, Mr. Obama got 61 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2008, according to exit polls. Senator Michael Bennet, a Democrat narrowly elected in 2010, credited a strong showing in Hispanic Colorado with part of his margin of victory.
Democrats also have a prominent spokesman and symbol in Lt. Gov. Joseph A. Garcia, who was president of Colorado State University in Pueblo before his election in 2010 alongside Gov. John Hickenlooper, the former mayor of Denver. Mr. Garcia said in an interview at the Capitol that his goal, beyond helping Mr. Obama and other Democrats this fall, is to get more Hispanics registered to vote and involved in public life, thus amplifying their voices in the state's long-term political mix. Though they represent only one-fifth of Colorado's total population, Hispanics account for one-third of the students in kindergarten through 12th grade, he said.
''They're young, and they're the future,'' he said.
But Republican leaders say they have reasons for optimism, too. Representative John Salazar, a Hispanic Democrat who represented Pueblo and a huge rural stretch to its west -- and is the brother of Interior Secretary Ken Salazar -- lost his re-election bid in 2010, at least in part, people in both parties say, for failing to close the deal with Hispanic voters. And leaders in both parties are also thinking hard about 2004, when many Hispanic voters in Colorado supported Mr. Bush, helping him win the state with a 53 percent majority.
The economic pain of recession and slow recovery -- disproportionately felt in Colorado by lower income and less educated residents, who make up a significant portion of the Hispanic base -- is also powerful fuel for an argument that something different might be better, Republicans say.
Here in Pueblo County, the unemployment rate was 10.6 percent in January, according to state figures, up from 9.8 percent in December, and 2.2 percentage points higher than the statewide total. Nearly one-third of foreign-born Hispanics who have been in Colorado less than 20 years live at or below the poverty line, according to the census.
The state's Republican Party chairman, Ryan Call, who is fluent in Spanish, said the party has focused on two main thrusts: recruiting local Hispanic Republicans to run for office to foster a greater grass-roots sense of party identity, and hammering on the message that the Democrats have not kept their promises to Hispanic voters.
In a state where native-born Hispanics outnumber new immigrants, Mr. Call said the goal was to erode the cultural link that has connected Hispanics to the Democrats, primarily by focusing on the here and now of jobs and economics. Hispanics make up 20 percent of Colorado's population, compared with 16 percent nationally. Pueblo and its surrounding rural areas, though, are 41 percent Hispanic, the residents often descended from old Southwest families who have been in North America for centuries, since the Spanish Empire days.
''The Democratic Party of their parents and grandparents is no longer the same Democratic Party,'' Mr. Call said.
As for issues like abortion or same-sex marriage that Republicans here once talked about as an inroad to reaching socially conservative Catholic and Evangelical Christian Hispanic voters, one might need a microscope to find those.
''We will see some of that in discrete and appropriate ways,'' Mr. Call said.
Democrats say they have a big head start this year compared with 2008 -- and against the Republicans, who are still scrapping among themselves. The campaign's national Latino vote director, Adrian Saenz, 41, a Texan who was Mr. Obama's state director in New Mexico in 2008, started his new job in November, organizing field offices and identifying points of focus from North Carolina, where a small, young Hispanic population has surged, to Las Vegas.
Mr. Saenz's expertise is the West; he was a senior aide to members of Congress in Texas and New Mexico, and worked for Senator John Kerry's campaign for president in 2004, also in New Mexico.
Mr. Garcia, the lieutenant governor, said his greatest allies in the effort to engage and energize Hispanic voters were the Republican presidential hopefuls. In debates and speeches on the primary trail, he said, they have competed with one another to talk tough about ethnicity, education and the path to citizenship in ways that do not play well in Hispanic Colorado.
''The Republicans just keep digging a deeper hole,'' he said.
Or revealing the truth, as people like Fred Brown might put it. Mr. Brown, 48, an auto mechanic in Pueblo, is Hispanic on his mother's side and is nobody's idea of a Democratic stalwart. He hates most of all that Hispanics get pigeonholed. ''Anybody but Obama,'' he said, in identifying his presidential preference.

HEADLINE: In China, A Rare View Of Infighting By Leaders

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES; Jonathan Ansfield contributed reporting, and Li Bibo contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- A deep vein of intrigue has always pulsed through the messy process of sorting out power in China's Communist Party.
The former president, Jiang Zemin, supposedly strengthened his position in 1995 by engineering a 16-year prison term on corruption charges for the Politburo member and Beijing mayor Chen Xitong. Nearly four years ago, a prominent opponent of President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, the party secretary Chen Liangyu of Shanghai, was sentenced to 18 years in prison on graft charges.
The leadership transition that will commence this autumn was supposed to put an end to that kind of political bloodshed. But the ouster on Thursday of Bo Xilai, the Communist Party secretary of Chongqing municipality who was openly campaigning for a spot in that elite leadership, threatens to puncture the veneer of comity at a crucial time, raising concerns of unsettling conflict within the Communist Party. 
Charismatic and ruthless, Mr. Bo is the rare Chinese politician who has built a base of popular support, deploying sweeping government powers to redistribute wealth among his 30 million subjects. His formidable political influence includes a network of support inherited from his father, a hero of the 1949 revolution. His admirers include leftists who want a revival of absolute government control of society. Some of his many detractors call him a neo-Maoist demagogue.
Now that elite leadership, the nine-member Standing Committee of the Politburo, appears to have blunted Mr. Bo's campaign to assume one of its seats. The surface explanation for his dismissal from the Chongqing party leadership is simple: Mr. Bo's longtime deputy, Wang Lijun, Chongqing's vice mayor and former police chief, scandalized the nation by taking refuge in an American consulate last month, apparently fearing imprisonment or worse. Mr. Bo paid the price for failing to stop him.
But outside experts say -- and anecdotal evidence suggests -- that old intrigues thought to have been suppressed are at work again. Indeed, some analysts say Mr. Bo's dismissal could foreshadow the kind of infighting over the future not seen since the Tiananmen Square protests set China on a rigidly authoritarian course nearly 23 years ago.
''This is a critical political issue, perhaps the most critical since 1989,'' Joseph Fewsmith, a scholar of China's senior leaders at Boston University, said in an interview. Mr. Bo's Chongqing policies, Professor Fewsmith said, could pose ''a challenge to the direction of reform and opening up as it has been implemented since the Deng Xiaoping era.''
Mr. Deng, who was a Chongqing-area party secretary in the 1950s, set China on a basically capitalist course in the late 1970s, forging a government that controlled strategic economic sectors but allowed private businesses to flourish elsewhere.
In Chongqing, Mr. Bo pursued a broadly opposite course. He mounted a sweeping anticorruption campaign to dismantle private business empires and created vast government-run businesses to build civic projects and housing developments. With a retro campaign encouraging residents to sing Mao-era patriotic songs, those initiatives delighted leftists and won broad support among vast throngs of citizens left behind in China's race toward wealth.
But among others, the programs raised uncomfortable parallels to Mao's disastrous Cultural Revolution crusade against capitalism, in which millions died or were persecuted, and smacked of demagoguery.
''Bo's basic problem is that he does not operate according to the party's established practices,'' said a journalist for one Communist Party news outlet, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisal. ''His way of doing things threatens and scares them.''
Who wins and loses from the attempt to silence Mr. Bo is not completely clear. For the first time, the process of replacing seven of the nine members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo and anointing a president and a premier, will not be dictated by an all-powerful figure like Mao Zedong or Mr. Deng. Instead, they will be chosen by a consensus of elite leaders.
By some accounts, Mr. Bo's ouster weakens the loose political coalition that is still maintained by Jiang Zemin, who left China's presidency a decade ago but still wields behind-the-scenes power through officials he has placed in the leadership bureaucracy. Mr. Jiang's motives are unclear; one of his proteges, Zhou Yongkang, the public security leader and Politburo insider, has been among Mr. Bo's most vocal backers.
Supporters of China's current quasi-capitalist course, including President Hu and Mr. Wen, appear to have won a victory. On Wednesday, a day before Mr. Bo's removal became public, Mr. Wen took oblique aim at his policies at an annual news conference at the National People's Congress, China's handpicked legislature.
Asked about the need for political and economic reform, Mr. Wen bemoaned ''the mistake of the Cultural Revolution,'' and warned that China risked a descent into Mao's chaos unless it adhered to Mr. Deng's prescription of a government-shepherded free market. Mr. Bo's firing a day later suggests that those remarks were aimed squarely at him.
There probably are other winners and losers, particularly among those ambitious Chinese politicians who were competing with Mr. Bo for one of the coveted Standing Committee seats. One is Wang Yang, now the Communist Party secretary of Guangdong Province, who was the Communist leader in Chongqing before Mr. Bo's arrival.
Mr. Wang, seen by some as a reformer in the style of Mr. Wen, has silently smarted as Mr. Bo denounced corruption in the city he once led. Mr. Bo's fall from Chongqing's heights could give Mr. Wang a leg up in the race for Standing Committee seats.
Then there is He Guoqiang, who until 2002 also held Mr. Bo's post as Chongqing party secretary. Mr. He now leads the Communist Party's Central Commission on Discipline, which reviews corruption cases -- for instance, the one said to involve Wang Lijun, Mr. Bo's former vice mayor and police chief.
Mr. He greeted Mr. Bo's Chongqing delegation in Beijing on March 3 as they assembled for the first session of the National People's Congress. ''Currently, the climate in Chongqing differs greatly from that in Beijing,'' he said. ''This year, the cold period has been relatively long in Beijing. And right now, it's a period of seasonal change.
''I hope,'' he continued, ''that everyone can take good care to keep warm and ward off coldness, and pay attention to maintaining good health.''
Many are convinced that Mr. He was not talking about the weather.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plans to Resume Military Aid to Egypt, Despite Human Rights Concerns

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration plans to resume military aid to Egypt, American officials said on Thursday, signaling its willingness to remain deeply engaged with the generals now running the country despite concerns over abuses and a still-uncertain transition to democracy.
To restart the aid, which has been a cornerstone of American relations with Egypt for more than three decades, the administration plans on sidestepping a new Congressional requirement that for the first time directly links military assistance to the protection of basic freedoms. 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is expected to waive the requirement on national security grounds as soon as early next week, according to administration and Congressional officials. That would allow some, but not yet all of $1.3 billion in military aid this year to move forward, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so that they could discuss internal deliberations.
The threat that the military aid might end was a critical factor in the release by the Egyptian government of seven Americans employed by four American-financed international organizations that were involved in community organizing activities. The prosecutions of the Americans were part of broader concerns the Obama administration has had about Egypt's progress since the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak a year ago.
The outcome is not likely to please either human rights advocates concerned about abuses by Egypt's security forces or many Egyptians, who have grown disillusioned with the military council and hostile toward American interference in Egyptian affairs. At a time of rising anti-American sentiment, the waiver may also alienate the revolutionaries and political reformers struggling to push the country toward civilian rule.
''Making such a certification would undermine the brave struggle of the Egyptian people for a society founded on respect for human rights and the rule of law,'' Adotei Akwei of Amnesty International USA wrote in a letter to Mrs. Clinton released on Thursday. ''Waiving the certification requirement would forfeit a key form of pressure for the advancement of human rights.''
The State Department's spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said a final decision had not yet been made over resuming the aid, but other officials said there was still a question over how to write the waiver.
President Obama, Mrs. Clinton and other senior officials explicitly warned Egypt's military leaders that the aid this year was at risk because of the prosecution of the American-financed organizations, which include Freedom House, the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute. The case, which began in December, continues, though Egyptian authorities, under intense pressure from the administration, lifted a travel ban on the seven American employees of the groups. The individuals were allowed to depart after the groups paid nearly $4 million in bail.
One administration official said that with the prosecution still under way, it was impossible for Mrs. Clinton to certify Egypt under the new law, which says that its leaders must carry out ''policies to protect freedom of expression, association and religion, and due process of law.'' At the same time, Egypt has seated a new Parliament in elections widely seen as free and fair, and it has scheduled a presidential election in May, with a runoff to follow in June. In addition, officials said they believed the aid was crucial to maintain close cooperation with Egypt's military on regional security and counterterrorism.
Besides the military assistance, the United States has budgeted $250 million for economic and political programs, including those targeted by the Egyptian courts. It has also proposed continuing military aid next year and creating a new $770 million fund to support economic development across North Africa.
Only the military assistance is tied to the certification on basic freedoms, though all assistance to Egypt requires the State Department to certify that the country continues to honor the Camp David peace treaties with Israel. The administration succeeded in including the waiver authority in the new law, giving Mrs. Clinton flexibility to allow some aid, without a blanket waiver.
Within the administration, some officials have argued that the certification should wait until the presidential election, but Egypt's military has exhausted previously authorized aid and has received no new American funds since the current fiscal year began in October.
Within weeks Egypt risks missing payments on defense contracts, largely with American arms manufacturers, forcing Mrs. Clinton to decide the certification question now. ''It's coming up sooner than some people wanted,'' one senior official said.
The pressure the administration put on Egyptian authorities to resolve the fate of the Americans working for nongovernment organizations provoked an angry reaction in Cairo. After the Americans were released and six of them left the country, the new Parliament, in a symbolic action, debated rejecting American aid outright, and questioned relations with Israel.
In Washington, such moves have heightened concerns, especially among lawmakers who imposed the conditions on aid. ''The Parliament has said some things that are very chilling,'' Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said at a budget hearing this week. ''We're not going to throw good money after bad,'' he added.
Many in Congress, though, share the administration's wariness off cutting off assistance altogether. ''The strength of Egypt, its stability, is important to the region and to the world,'' the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, said on Thursday during a visit to Cairo with a delegation of lawmakers, ''and we want to be helpful in that regard.''
But Tom Malinowski, director of the Washington office of Human Rights Watch, said the administration needed to rethink assistance to Egypt after decades of focusing it largely on the military.
''There's a much bigger question here,'' he said, ''and that is: if we want to help a post-Mubarak Egypt, does the current aid package make the slightest bit of sense?''

HEADLINE: A U.S. tie to Push On Surveillance In Chinese Cities

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS and PENN BULLOCK; Andrew Jacobs reported from Beijing, and Penn Bullock from New York. Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- As the Chinese government forges ahead on a multibillion-dollar effort to blanket the country with surveillance cameras, one American company stands to profit: Bain Capital, the private equity firm founded by Mitt Romney.
In December, a Bain-run fund in which a Romney family blind trust has holdings purchased the video surveillance division of a Chinese company that claims to be the largest supplier to the government's Safe Cities program, a highly advanced monitoring system that allows the authorities to watch over university campuses, hospitals, mosques and movie theaters from centralized command posts.
The Bain-owned company, Uniview Technologies, produces what it calls ''infrared antiriot'' cameras and software that enable police officials in different jurisdictions to share images in real time through the Internet. Previous projects have included an emergency command center in Tibet that ''provides a solid foundation for the maintenance of social stability and the protection of people's peaceful life,'' according to Uniview's Web site. 
Such surveillance systems are often used to combat crime and the manufacturer has no control over whether they are used for other purposes. But human rights advocates say in China they are also used to intimidate and monitor political and religious dissidents. ''There are video cameras all over our monastery, and their only purpose is to make us feel fear,'' said Loksag, a Tibetan Buddhist monk in Gansu Province. He said the cameras helped the authorities identify and detain nearly 200 monks who participated in a protest at his monastery in 2008.
Mr. Romney has had no role in Bain's operations since 1999 and had no say over the investment in China. But the fortunes of Bain and Mr. Romney are still closely tied.
The financial disclosure forms Mr. Romney filed last August show that a blind trust in the name of his wife, Ann Romney, held a relatively small stake of between $100,000 and $250,000 in the Bain Capital Asia fund that purchased Uniview.
In a statement, R. Bradford Malt, who manages the Romneys' trusts, noted that he had put trust assets into the fund before it bought Uniview. He said that the Romneys had no role in guiding their investments. He also said he had no control over the Asian fund's choice of investments.
Mr. Romney reported on his August disclosure forms that he and his wife earned a minimum of $5.6 million from Bain assets held in their blind trusts and retirement accounts. Bain employees and executives are also among the largest donors to his campaign, and their contributions accounted for 10 percent of the money received over the past year by Restore Our Future, the pro-Romney ''super PAC.'' Bain employees have also made substantial contributions to Democratic candidates, including President Obama.
Bain's decision to enter China's fast-growing surveillance industry raises questions about the direct role that American corporations play in outfitting authoritarian governments with technology that can be used to repress their own citizens.
It also comes at a delicate time for Mr. Romney, who has frequently called for a hard line against the Chinese government's suppression of religious freedom and political dissent.
As with previous deals involving other American companies, critics argue that Bain's acquisition of Uniview violates the spirit -- if not necessarily the letter -- of American sanctions imposed on Beijing after the deadly crackdown on protests in Tiananmen Square. Those rules, written two decades ago, bar American corporations from exporting to China ''crime-control'' products like those that process fingerprints, make photo identification cards or use night vision technology.
Most video surveillance equipment is not covered by the sanctions, even though a Canadian human rights group found in 2001 that Chinese security forces used Western-made video cameras to help identify and apprehend Tiananmen Square protesters.
Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, who frequently assails companies that do business with Chinese security agencies, said calls by some members of Congress to pass stricter regulations on American businesses have gone nowhere. ''These companies are busy making a profit and don't want to face realities, but what they're doing is wrong,'' said Mr. Wolf, who is co-chairman of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.
In public comments and in a statement posted on his campaign Web site, Mr. Romney has accused the Obama administration of placing economic concerns above human rights in managing relations with China. He has called on the White House to offer more vigorous support of those who criticize the Chinese Communist Party.
''Any serious U.S. policy toward China must confront the fact that China's regime continues to deny its people basic political freedoms and human rights,'' according to the statement on his Web site. ''The United States has an important role to play in encouraging the evolution of China toward a more politically open and democratic order.''
In recent years, a number of Western companies, including Honeywell, General Electric, I.B.M. and United Technologies, have been criticized for selling sophisticated surveillance-related technology to the Chinese government.
Other companies have been accused of directly helping China quash perceived opponents. In 2007, Yahoo settled a lawsuit asserting that it had provided the authorities with e-mails of a journalist who was later sentenced to 10 years in prison for sending an e-mail that prosecutors charged contained state secrets.
Cisco Systems is fighting a lawsuit in the United States filed by a human rights group over Internet networking equipment it sold to the Chinese government. The lawsuit asserts that the system, tailored to government demands, allowed the authorities to track down and torture members of the religious group Falun Gong.
Bain defended its purchase of Uniview, stressing that the Chinese company's products were advertised as instruments for crime control, not political repression. ''China's increasingly urban population will face growing needs around personal safety and property protection,'' the company said in a statement. ''Video surveillance is part of the solution to that, as it is anywhere in the world.'' The company also said that only one-third of Uniview's sales were to public security bureaus.
William A. Reinsch, president of the National Foreign Trade Council in Washington, said it was up to the American government, not individual companies, to set the guidelines for such business ventures. ''A lot of the stuff we're talking about is truly dual use,'' said Mr. Reinsch, a former Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration. ''You can sell it to a local police force that will use it to track down speeders, but you can also sell it to a ministry of state security that will use it to monitor dissidents.''
But Adam Segal, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and an expert on the intersection of technology and domestic security in China, said American companies could not shirk responsibility for the way their technology is used, especially in the wake of recent controversies over the sales of Western Internet filtering systems to autocratic rulers in the Arab world. ''Technology companies have to begin to think about the ethics and political implications of selling these technologies,'' he said.
Uniview is proud of its close association with China's security establishment and boasts about the scores of surveillance systems it has created for local security agencies in the six years since the Safe Cities program was started.
''Social management and society building pose new demands for surveillance and control systems,'' Uniview says in its promotional materials, which include an interview with Zhang Pengguo, the company's chief executive. ''A harmonious society is the essential nature of socialism with Chinese characteristics,'' Mr. Zhang says.
Until now, Bain's takeover of Uniview has drawn little attention outside China. The company was formerly the surveillance division of H3C, a joint venture between 3Com and Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant whose expansion plans in the United States have faced resistance from Congress over questions about its ties to the Chinese military.
In 2010, 3Com, along with H3C, became a subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard in a $2.7 billion buyout deal.
H3C also sells technology unrelated to video surveillance, including Internet firewall products, but it was the video surveillance division alone that drew Bain Capital's interest.
In December, H3C announced that Bain had bought out the surveillance division and formed Uniview, although under terms of the buyout, H3C provides Uniview with products, technical support and, for a period of time, the use of its brand name. Bain controls Uniview but says it has no role in its day-to-day operations.
Bain is, however, well positioned to profit. According to the British firm IMS Research, the Chinese market for security camera networks was $2.5 billion last year, a figure that is expected to double by 2015, with more than two-thirds of that demand coming from the government. Uniview currently has just 1 percent of the market, the firm said.
Chinese cities are rushing to construct their own surveillance systems. Chongqing, in Sichuan Province, is spending $4.2 billion on a network of 500,000 cameras, according to the state news media. Guangdong Province, the manufacturing powerhouse adjacent to Hong Kong, is mounting one million cameras. In Beijing, the municipal government is seeking to place cameras in all entertainment venues, adding to the skein of 300,000 cameras that were installed here for the 2008 Olympics.
By marrying Internet, cellphone and video surveillance, the government is seeking to create an omniscient monitoring system, said Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong. ''When it comes to surveillance, China is pretty upfront about its totalitarian ambitions,'' he said.
For the legion of Chinese intellectuals, democracy advocates and religious figures who have tangled with the government, surveillance cameras have become inescapable.
Yang Weidong, a politically active filmmaker, said a phalanx of 13 cameras were installed in and around his apartment building last year after he submitted an interview request to President Hu Jintao, drawing the ire of domestic security agents. In January, Ai Weiwei, the artist and public critic, was questioned by the police after he threw stones at cameras trained on his front gate.
Li Tiantian, 45, a human rights lawyer in Shanghai, said the police used footage recorded outside a hotel in an effort to manipulate her during the three months she was illegally detained last year. The video, she said, showed her entering the hotel in the company of men other than her boyfriend.
During interrogations, Ms. Li said, the police taunted her about her sex life and threatened to show the video to her boyfriend. The boyfriend, however, refused to watch, she said.
''The scale of intrusion into people's private lives is unprecedented,'' she said in a phone interview. ''Now when I walk on the street, I feel so vulnerable, like the police are watching me all the time.''

HEADLINE: Why Go to College? Readers Weigh In

BYLINE: HOLLY EPSTEIN OJALVO


HIGHLIGHT: After we asked Dale J. Stephens, a Thiel Fellow and the founder of UnCollege, to share his reasons why college need not be a foregone conclusion, his ideas generated energetic responses. 

 BODY:
Recently, we posed the question "Why go to college at all?" and asked Dale J. Stephens, the founder of UnCollege and something of a heretic in the world of higher education, to share his reasons why college need not be a foregone conclusion.
"If you want to learn, college is the last place you should go," Mr. Stephens said. "A lot of learning isn't happening on college campuses."
Mr. Stephens is a Thiel Fellow, a former student who agreed to drop out of school in exchange for a $100,000 grant to start his own tech company. We learned this week that the founder of the fellowship, Peter Thiel, has decided to teach at Stanford.
This recent news has revived the discussion about the value of going to college. Not surprisingly, Mr. Stephens's ideas generated energetic responses: more than 175 reader comments on the blog, and additional commentary on Twitter and Facebook, ranging from enthusiastic to skeptical to dismissive.
Here's a look at what some of our readers had to say.
Those who rejected Mr. Stephens's arguments included Larry Litchfield, who cited statistics - reported in The Times, no less - to make the point that a college degree is economically valuable. Nancy argued that young people would do well to pursue Mr. Stephens's vision of mentor-guided "self-directed, project-based learning" in college. 
Several readers, like Harper, Srini and Felicity Twenty, noted that college is a fertile environment for developing critical reasoning skills.
Among others, Jacqueline said that her college experience was characterized by what Mr. Stephens considers the hallmarks of "unschooling," including self-direction and practical experience. Laura noted that opting out is generally not realistic or responsible, given the market value of a degree, and Kate Weber thought small liberal arts colleges are the answer to the problems Mr. Stephens described.
Roger argued that the true value of college is ineffable and "deeply personal," not fully measurable in quantifiable ways like test scores and salaries, though he ultimately agreed with Mr. Stephens that if it isn't the right fit, it might make sense to forgo college, at least temporarily. 
On the other end of the spectrum, at least one college professor endorsed the idea of sitting out, including Daniel M. Perrine, who bemoaned time spent pursuing a higher degree as "wasteful." Readers who agreed with that sentiment - many of whom, interestingly, are retired or in midcareer - included David Montague, who said college was becoming a "racket"; Eric from Maine, who said schooling seemed to limit, not expand, his career choices and financial outlook; and Jeff Clement, who found he developed self-reliance traveling around the world while his friends were in school.
While some readers criticized Mr. Stephens for advocating behavior that is tantamount to gaming the system, Dee Healy supported her son taking an " la carte" approach to higher education, and El Kabong projected that the value of a child's decision not to go to college to be at least $1 million. 
Finally, 15-year-old Daniel took Mr. Stephens's position a step further to declare high school "completely useless," while Konstantin remained hopeful that college would, eventually, have been worthwhile. And Michael Abraham put a fine point on it: "Everyone should follow their own path."

HEADLINE: Investing With a Long-Term View

BYLINE: BUCKS EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Bucks readers weigh in on advice in the Wealth Matters column that investors should expect a sustained period of low returns. 

 BODY:
The stock market has been doing better lately. Some economic gauges are indicating growing strength in the American economy. So why are some financial advisers to wealthy families telling their clients to prepare for a sustained period of low investment returns?
That is the question that Paul Sullivan asks in his Wealth Matters column this week. 
The argument that one of the advisers, Jean Brunel, chief investment officer at GeoSpring Family Offices, made to Paul was that the return on cash is now close to zero. That, in turn, has lowered the returns on stocks and bonds.
Mr. Brunel wasn't alone in his recommendation to clients to be patient. Other advisers Paul spoke to echoed his view that investors should look at their investments over the long term. 
What do you think? Are you prepared for lower returns on your retirement portfolio for the next few years? What steps have you taken to insulate yourself from another possible economic downturn?

HEADLINE: The Gambling Epoch

BYLINE: DEAN ROBINSON


HIGHLIGHT: Chuck-a-luck, bouncing ball and other obscure casino games in today's Age of Gambling. 

 BODY:
You know how history books help you keep track of things with their pithy period labels? The Roaring '20s. The Industrial Revolution. The Pleistocene Epoch. The Ages of Reason, Enlightenment, Gilded, Stone, Bronze and Dark.
Someday future historians are going to need a handle for today's era, and I'm here to propose a candidate. I used to think we were living in the Age of Derivatives, but after this week's cover story on the Foxwoods Resort Casino. ... Sorry, hold on a moment, I have to go check on my March Madness streams, update my brackets, call my bookie. ... O.K., I'm back, and convinced now that the Age of Gambling is a better label for the day.
After all, as Michael Sokolove puts it in "A Big Bet Gone Bad," casino gambling by itself is "a commodity, available within a day's drive to the vast majority of U.S. residents." It's in 36 states. There are some 450 Indian casinos and 566 commercial, or non-Indian, casinos. "An economic impact study commissioned ... last year counted $34.6 billion in nationwide gambling revenues in 2010," Sokolove writes. "According to the study, casinos supported 820,000 jobs, created $125 billion in spending and accounted for close to 1 percent of the U.S. gross-domestic product." And those figures don't include Indian casinos!
Foxwoods, one such Indian casino, generates its own outsize figures: 6,300 slot machines, 40,000 gamblers each weekend day, more square footage than the Pentagon. Still, here's the passage that really caught my eye:
Connecticut's agreement, or compact, with the Pequots permits various table games at Foxwoods, including blackjack, poker and roulette, along with lesser-known games of chance like chuck-a-luck, pan game, money-wheels and bouncing ball.
Chuck-a-luck? Pan game? Bouncing ball? I need to get out to more gambling dens, apparently, because I've never heard of these things. (I think I can figure out what money-wheels are - Hi, Vanna!) In fact, I wondered at first if we were talking about what's going on in this scene from "Vegas Vacation," where Uncle Eddie (Randy Quaid) takes Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) to a different sort of gaming parlor - "I gotta warn you, Clark, they don't play the same games here that they do at them regular casinos" - and they run through their wad of $20s playing Coin Toss, Pick a Number Between 1 and 10, War, Rock Scissors Paper and Guess Which Hand?
But no, no chuck-a-luck there. So I turn to Wolfram Alpha, which tells me chuck-a-luck is "a gambling game played at carnivals in which a player may bet on any one of the numbers 1 through 6." As for pan game, turns out that's short for panguingue and evolved from conquian. You take eight 52-card decks, remove the 8's, 9's and 10's, deal 10 cards to as many as 15 players, try to "meld" 11 cards -
Oh, never mind, I can't possibly win at something that makes my head ache like that. I think I'll go try "Pick a Number" with Clark Griswold instead.

HEADLINE: St. Patrick's to Undergo a Three-Year, $177 Million Renovation

BYLINE: DAVID W. DUNLAP


HIGHLIGHT: Scaffolding soon will hide the interior and exterior of the cathedral, with work going on for two to three years, assuming fund-raising continues to be successful. 

 BODY:
Take one good, long last look at St. Patrick's Cathedral, a defining landmark of New York City. It is about to disappear for two or three years under a cocoon of scaffolding, inside and out, that will permit a $177 million rehabilitation project to unfold, the most extensive work at the cathedral in generations.
Come to think of it, don't take good a look. You may see the growing cracks in the marble facade and the patchwork of repairs up and down the buttresses, the dimness of the stained-glass windows and smoke-darkened walls, the zebra striping caused by lathing behind the plaster ceiling vaults, jerry-built vents poking out of the triforium arches along the nave, the jury-rigged cooling plant sitting in a giant plywood shed on 51st Street and the climbing-ivy accumulation of wiring and conduits around the column bases. You may even spot a chunk of stone on the cathedral grounds that has fallen from a wall above.
These and many other problems are to be addressed in the project, which is to be formally announced on Saturday by Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan as part of the celebration of St. Patrick's Day.
"I'm talking about survival," the cardinal said in an interview last week. "If we don't do something substantive for St. Patrick's Cathedral, in four or five years we're going to have to close it, because it will be dangerous."
That may be a bit of fund-raising hyperbole. But the physical condition of St. Patrick's, which was designed by James Renwick Jr. and opened in 1879, has been a source of concern since Cardinal Edward M. Egan was archbishop and initiated the renovation project more than five years ago.
"There is actually an exponential degradation of the building," said Jeffrey Murphy, a partner in Murphy Burnham & Buttrick Architects, which is responsible for the renovation. "A little crack that would cost $300 to fix initially has the potential to turn into a several thousand dollar stone replacement if left unchecked. It's not hyperbole to say that doing nothing will cause the archdiocese to spend a lot more money down the line."
Cardinal Dolan and Mr. Murphy said the last renovation of equivalent scope occurred in the 1940s. Lesser rehabilitation was done in the 1970s.
While the cathedral will not close during the renovation, it will not look anything like itself. In the first of three phases, beginning next month, exterior scaffolding will be erected around the entire Fifth Avenue facade, all the way to the top of the spires, 330 feet above the sidewalk. It will run along the nave on both sides and then wrap around the north and south transepts - the arms in the cathedral's cruciform plan.
Interior scaffolding will rise at the west end of the nave; that is, the bays closest to the Fifth Avenue entrance. This will obscure the organ loft and the great rose window. The organ pipes in this area of the cathedral will be removed during the renovation to protect them from dust.
Cardinal Dolan said financing was in hand to cover the first phase, which will cost about $45 million. Half of the money is coming from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, he said, and the rest from the trustees of the cathedral and from private donors.
For the second phase to begin in November and to take advantage of the scaffolding already on site, another $50 million must be raised soon. Success depends on the answers to several questions:
Will New Yorkers who disagree with the cardinal's conservative stance on social issues be able - or willing - to distinguish St. Patrick's as a civic landmark that stands apart from church teaching and archdiocesan politicking? How interested will anyone be in giving money to a landmark restoration project at a time when many basic human needs are going unmet in the city? And how much philanthropic money is out there in any case, given the state of the economy?
Cardinal Dolan allowed that some prospective donors had raised the issue of whether bricks and mortar ought to be tended to while the poor go hungry. Indeed, he said, one non-Catholic prospect said he would not contribute to the cathedral renovation, though he would give a like amount to Catholic Charities.
But the cardinal said that he hoped to persuade such donors that improving the cathedral would be a boon to the city's economy - "Please God, hiring a lot of workers is going to help people without jobs" - and that the cathedral's inspirational role would be strengthened, turning those who attend services into "apostles to the poor."
"When you have a renewed, revived, restored, repaired St Patrick's," Cardinal Dolan said, "we're going to be more effectively able to preach that message of service to the poor; ergo, we're going to be able to help the poor."
He said he had been told by more than one of the 50 or 60 potential donors whom he has personally courted that they cringed at some of the church's positions but still loved St. Patrick's enough to contribute.
The most obvious improvement visitors can expect to see, probably by early 2014, is a much brighter facade. The marble will be cleaned with a process known as Rotec vortex, using a low-pressure stream of swirling air, water and microabrasive powder. It is so gentle that one could hold a hand in front of it, said Raymond M. Pepi, the president and founder of Building Conservation Associates, consultants on the project. "And all you'd get is a clean hand."
Inside the cathedral - surprisingly - marble reaches only about 30 feet above the floor. In a 19th-century economy move, the builders of the interior switched from marble to a material called Beton Coignet, also known as artificial stone. Above the concrete walls are ceiling vaults of plaster. The concrete and plaster surfaces must be cleaned and repainted. An area around the ambulatory chapel of St. Andrew has been set aside for testing paint samples.
There are more than 1,300 stained-glass panels in the cathedral. About 8 percent will be removed for repair, Mr. Murphy said. The rest will be cleaned and repaired in place. A big problem is posed by protective glazing installed decades ago over the stained glass, which traps moisture and heat. One solution for the most vulnerable stained-glass panels is to set them in special frames, just far enough out of the window surrounds that they are naturally ventilated on all sides.
It is a measure of the times that the restoration team includes a security consultant, Ducibella Venter & Santore, which has handled threat assessments and protective measures for the new World Trade Center, among other potential high-profile terrorist targets. Mr. Murphy would say nothing about the security firm's recommendations for the cathedral. But the cathedral's design, set back from the street and well above the sidewalk in most places, does offer an inherent defensive advantage against vehicle-borne bombs.
Among the fund-raising leaders is Rob Speyer, the president and a co-chief executive of Tishman Speyer, whose holdings include a substantial interest in Rockefeller Center, across Fifth Avenue. Mr. Speyer has suggested the possibility, however conceptual, of tapping into Rockefeller Center's power plant, running utility lines under the street and providing heating and cooling to the cathedral.
"Rockefeller Center has surely benefited over the years from its link to St. Patrick's Cathedral," he said. "I'm Jewish. We are neighbors. This is not about church politics. This is about restoring one of the city's most important landmarks. It's a responsibility we all share."

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $17,070,000

BYLINE: MARC SANTORA


HIGHLIGHT: Three apartments were combined into a 7,000-square-foot penthouse on the Upper West Side. 

 BODY:
A three-apartment penthouse combination that sold for $17.07 million in the Laureate on the Upper West Side was the most expensive sale of the week, according to city records.
"The buyer needed a large, elegant and well-appointed home, complemented by the Laureate's long list of amenities and services," said Shlomi Reuveni, who is leading the sales team at the building for Brown Harris Stevens Select.
With 7,000 square feet and a floor plan that could allow for as many as 10 bedrooms and 9 bathrooms, there ought to be enough space. 
As with nearly every sale in the Laureate, which has logged the week's priciest sale four other times since November, the apartment was purchased anonymously through a limited liability company. Mr. Reuveni declined to discuss details of the deal.
The building, which was designed by James S. Davidson and his firm, SLCE Architects, echoes the elegance of the prewar apartment houses that line Broadway. By offering oversize apartments at a time when homes with more than four bedrooms are in great demand, the Stahl Organization, the developer, has tapped into what is now the strongest segment of the city's real estate market. There are just a handful of unsold apartments at the building, including a penthouse priced at $22 million.
Big Ticket covers closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Capital Gains vs. Ordinary Income

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: When it comes to taxes, capital gains should not be treated differently from income derived from investment in human capital, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
In a column titled "Capital Gains, Ordinary Income and Shades of Gray," the Harvard economist N. Gregory Mankiw, who advises Mitt Romney in his presidential campaign, offers a fine teaching piece on the tenuous and often confusing line between ordinary income and capital gains under our tax code. As Professor Mankiw reminds us, the highest tax rate on ordinary income is now 35 percent while that on capital gains is only 15 percent. 
Using four illustrations from transactions in real estate, Professor Mankiw concludes that the favorable 15 percent tax rate enjoyed by Mr. Romney on carried interest earned in his years at the private equity partnership Bain Capital is really not different in substance from the preferential tax treatment enjoyed by millions of other Americans on their real-estate transactions - quod erat demonstrandum (Q.E.D.).
I found myself persuaded by this argument, up to that point. But then, almost as an afterthought, Professor Mankiw touches in passing what for me is the crux of the issue. He writes: 
Critics of current law think it is unfair that these private equity partners are taxed at capital-gains rates, whereas other high-income individuals like doctors and lawyers pay the much higher tax rates for ordinary income. It is a reasonable point, and some reform may well be appropriate. But as the tax situations of Abe through Earl illustrate, it is not obvious what the best approach would be. Not all problems have easy answers. 
On this point, I beg to differ with my colleague. Why is the answer so difficult? To my mind, the best approach would be to abolish the distinction between capital gains and ordinary income altogether and desist from using the tax system for any kind of economic or social engineering.

The case for granting preferential tax treatment to the real-estate transactions that Professor Mankiw describes - and to carried interest in private equity firms - strikes me as extremely shaky on grounds of both horizontal equity and plain economics. 
In his popular textbook "Principles of Microeconomics," Professor Mankiw teaches students that "horizontal equity states that taxpayers with similar ability to pay should contribute the same amount." Well put.
Consider now a person who bought a vacation home for $500,000 and two years later, during one of our recurrent real-estate bubbles, sells it for $1.5 million. That $1 million profit is now taxed at a rate of only 15 percent. If the home had been the principal residence of this person and his or her spouse, half of the $1 million profit would not be taxed at all.
Suppose next that this tax-favored person's neighbor were a busy neurosurgeon whose many hours of hard, physical and intellectual work earned him or her a net practice income of $1 million during those same two years. That neurosurgeon would pay the ordinary income-tax rate on that income (on average a bit less than 35 percent, because only income over $388,350 a year is taxed at 35 percent). 
By what definition of the term would can one call the glaringly differential tax treatment of the real estate investor and of the neurosurgeon horizontally equitable? Indeed, by what theory of justice could one defend it on ethical grounds?
Now, the argument may be that horizontal equity in this case must take a back seat to economic efficiency, as Congress seeks to encourage the formation of productive "capital" - including, apparently, owner-occupied residences and second homes. 
But if encouraging capital formation is the argument in favor of the capital-gains tax preference, why not include in "capital formation" the formation of "human capital," that is, the personal investment required to produce well-educated and well-trained individuals? Corporations and nations thrive economically on the strength of their human capital, which is arguably their most valuable asset.
A neurosurgeon, for example, who restores a stricken individual to good health and a productive life most assuredly represents a form of human capital capable of building yet other human capital. So, as I have argued, do conscientious parents, high school teachers and, yes, even college professors.
If the partners at Bain Capital are granted a low 15 percent tax rate on what basically is an earned commission for hours smartly worked, rather than a return on their own invested capital, should not the return on the neurosurgeon's own investment in his or her human capital be granted the same preference?
If pressed, the proponents of the capital-gains preference might concede that a tax preference for gains on transactions in residential real estate is hard to defend; but they probably would not extend it to investments in financial securities, such as common stock of corporations. 
Here the proponents of lower capital-gains taxation conjure up an image of, say, Jones purchasing shares of stock directly from the issuing corporation, which then invests the proceeds in new structures and equipment. 
More typically, however, sales and purchases of corporate common stock take place among parties quite outside of the issuing corporation. For example, Jones may buy the stock from Chen, who may have reaped a capital gain from once buying and now selling the stock. Chen may have bought the stock from another person not related to the issuing company. 
When Jones pays Chen, it is anybody's guess what Chen does with the money. For all we know, Chen will spend it on a luxury car. Why, then, should any gain Chen enjoys on his or her investment in that stock be granted a tax preference? No new capital formation was supported by this trade in a stock sold by the company years ago.
Here the argument may be that when Chen achieved a capital gain on selling the stock to Jones, that capital gain must reflect an increase in the earnings per share of the underlying corporation, which was already taxed at the corporate rate. Taxing Chen's capital gain at any positive rate, the argument goes, amounts to double taxation. 
I find that argument an enormous stretch, especially in an era of high stock-price volatility and recurring bubbles in stock prices that are related much more to fluctuations in optimism and pessimism about the future - i.e., the risk premiums that traders price into their stock valuations - than to fluctuations in the underlying corporate earnings. 
My bottom line on the issue of tax preferences is that although Congress may wish to encourage some transactions leading directly to the formation of new capital - including human capital - that preference is best expressed with explicit subsidies that show up in government budgets and for which politicians can be held accountable, rather than through tax expenditures that spare politicians explicit accountability for their indirect spending.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
Lean Times for Dewey & LeBoeuf | Five years after the merger that created Dewey & LeBoeuf, the corporate law world is again abuzz over the firm, but for less auspicious reasons.
Tens of millions of dollars in deferred compensation are owed to Dewey's partners. Some have been told they are being paid a fraction of what they were promised. The firm is cutting 5 percent of its lawyers and 6 percent of its staff. Nineteen of its 300 partners have left Dewey since January, including heads of major practice areas. About a dozen more departures are expected.
The turmoil at Dewey is the result of financial missteps by the firm's management, according to numerous people speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Yet its problems also highlight the risks in an era when many big law firms have jettisoned traditional notions of partnership in favor of a star system, legal experts say. This free-agent market for top performers has changed the corporate law landscape, both financially and culturally.

HEADLINE: U.P.S. Still Talking to TNT Over $6.4 Billion Takeover

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The United Parcel Service said on Friday that it was still talking to the Dutch shipping company TNT Express about a potential takeover, which values the European outfit at roughly 4.89 billion euros, or $6.4 billion. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The United Parcel Service said on Friday that it was still talking to the Dutch shipping company TNT Express about a potential takeover, which values the European outfit at roughly 4.89 billion euros, or $6.4 billion.
In a statement, U.P.S., based in Atlanta, said it was in "constructive discussions TNT Express regarding a potential transaction to acquire the entire issued share capital."
The announcement follows a statement by TNT's board on Feb. 17 in which the European company rejected U.P.S.'s takeover offer. TNT added that it remained in negotiations with the United States delivery company.
Under Dutch takeover rules, U.P.S. had four weeks after approaching TNT to clarify its intentions for the company.
The potential deal would be U.P.S.'s largest acquisition. The shipping giant's biggest purchase to date was its $1.2 billion takeover of the Overnite Corporation in 2005, according to data from Capital IQ. 
U.P.S. has ample resources to make a bid. The company said it held nearly $5.5 billion in cash and short-term investments as of Dec. 31.
A deal with U.P.S. also would provide some good news for TNT shareholders. Since the Dutch company was spun off from the mail carrier PostNL last May, TNT has struggled with what it says is reduced demand for air shipping amid a global economic slowdown.
TNT and its now-former parent had held talks about a potential sale to U.P.S. more than three years ago, though those discussions fell apart.

HEADLINE: Fed Revises Its Numbers on Stress Test for Citigroup

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The Fed says it overstated projected losses on Citigroup's first-lien mortgages, but the revision does not change the capital ratio projected by the recent stress test. 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve made an error in its stress test of Citigroup that led it to overstate a crucial measurement of losses on the bank's mortgages, the central bank acknowledged on Friday.
The Fed also issued corrections for Bank of America, Ally Financial, MetLife and Wells Fargo. It said the corrections did not change the capital ratios projected by the stress tests, which estimated the losses that a bank could bear amid situations that included a severe recession and a market collapse.
The tests, published on Tuesday, calculated how much a bank's capital would be affected assuming losses on a range of loans and securities over a 27-month period through the end of 2013.
 Still, Citigroup did not do as well as its big-bank peers in some tests. The revisions at Citigroup were for the most part bigger than the amendments at the other financial firms.
In the original test results, the Fed projected losses on Citigroup's first-lien home loans that would be equivalent to 9.7 percent of its total mortgages. But the Fed now says that the loss rate is 9.3 percent. The change occurred after the Fed moved projected losses on Citigroup's foreign mortgages to another category. As a result, the 9.3 percent loss rate is just for mortgages in the United States.
The change seems small but it signals that the Fed failed to include nearly $40 billion of foreign mortgages in its loss-rate calculation for Citigroup's mortgage.
Initially, the Fed projected $9.3 billion of losses on what looked like all of Citigroup's mortgages, producing the 9.7 percent loss rate. The Fed appeared to be assuming that Citigroup had around $96 billion of mortgages, since $9.3 billion is 9.7 percent of $96 billion.
But securities filings show Citigroup had $133 billion of mortgages at the end of September 2011, which was when the Fed started the test. That total combined $95 billion of American mortgages and $38 billion of international mortgages.
And something else did not appear to add up. Applying the Fed's dollar losses of $9.3 billion to Citigroup's actual mortgage total of $133 billion produces a loss rate of 7 percent, far lower than the 9.7 percent in the original test.
That would put Citigroup more in line with the Fed-forecast mortgage loss rates of 6.7 percent for Bank of America, and 6.3 percent for JPMorgan Chase. Dropping the loss rate to 7 percent would have made Citigroup's mortgages look healthier.
Now that the Fed has corrected its results, why didn't the mortgage loss rate fall to 7 percent, instead of falling to only 9.3 percent on domestic mortgages? That seems to be because the Fed is not including foreign mortgages in that loss-rate calculation. The low projected loss rates for those loans are now counted in a category called "other loans."
"We will continue to work with the Federal Reserve regarding these numbers," a Citigroup spokesman said on Friday.

HEADLINE: At SXSW Springsteen Draws an All-Star Guest List

BYLINE: JON PARELES


HIGHLIGHT: The encore of a 2-1/2 hour set features Eric Burdon, Jimmy Cliff, Alejandro Escovedo, Joe Ely among others. 

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- Bruce Springsteen, of all people, used the word "Twitterverse" during his South by Southwest concert at ACL-Live at the Moody Theater, a 2,700-capacity room here where the public television series Austin City Limits is staged. On Thursday morning in his SXSW keynote speech he had praised the Animals, particularly the song "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" -- about the son of a hard-working father, looking for a better life -- as the source for "every song I've ever written." (The Animals didn't write the song; it's by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil.) Mr. Springsteen then demonstrated how similar the Animals' bass line in "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" was to the one in his own "Badlands," accusing himself of "successful theft" (although he actually switched it from a minor to a major key and changed its contour.)
 Mr. Springsteen also appreciated the Animals' general homeliness, he said, because at the time he considered himself "hideous." By Thursday night, through the Twitterverse, word had gotten to Eric Burdon, the Animals' lead singer, who happened to be in Austin and was apparently not too insulted to be described as "like your shrunken daddy with a wig on." Among the encores in a set that ran over two-and-a-half hours, Mr. Burdon performed "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" backed by Mr. Springsteen and his much-expanded E Street Band; his desperate growl was still there. 
That was SXSW's visibility and serendipity at work. Its status as a magnet for musicians brought more guest encores. A vocally and physically limber Jimmy Cliff, the reggae pioneer, took over the band for three encores, and in the finale -- Woody Guthrie's "This Land Is Your Land" -- Mr. Springsteen was joined by two of Austin's local musical heroes, Alejandro Escovedo and Joe Ely, along with members of Arcade Fire and the Low Anthem, Garland Jeffreys and Tom Morello from Rage Against the Machine.
 Mr. Guthrie, a major inspiration for Mr. Springsteen's new album, "Wrecking Ball," would have been 100 on July 14 of this year, and Mr. Springsteen started the set with Guthrie's "I Ain't Got No Home," an itinerant worker's lament. His expanded band, which adds a horn section, backup singers and fiddle to the core E Street Band, treated it like a gospel song with six-part harmony. 
 The bulk of the concert -- apparently the framework of his coming arena tour -- was almost exactly the set Mr. Springsteen played at the Apollo Theater. Thursday's concert added a nod to Texas in "Seeds," which is about a homeless man in Houston after an oil boom and bust.
 After vowing "to put a whuppin' session on the recession," Mr. Springsteen said, "As usual, we've got a story to tell you." With groups of songs segued together, the set was a series of cycles of struggle and hope, connecting the "Wrecking Ball" album to his longtime themes. Again and again, fist-shaking gave way to fist-pumping. "Shackled and Drawn," a foot-stomping song of desperate hard times, moved into "Waiting on a Sunny Day," which is rainy but more optimistic. "Wrecking Ball," about living with the knowledge of mortality, gave way to "Badlands," which insists things will turn around. 
The songs from "Wrecking Ball" often sound merrier than their lyrics, heading for a hootenanny, a New Orleans brass-band parade, an Irish dance or a mariachi serenade; their music embodies Mr. Springsteen's inclusive America. Older songs deploy the E Street Band as a wall of sound, a rhythm-and-blues revue and a righteously martial rock army. The set was also grounded in gospel music, from its opening harmonies to the way its closer, "Land of Hope and Glory" became a gospel-train medley with "This Train" and "People Get Ready." 
 There was mourning, too, for longtime E Street Band members who have died: the keyboardist Danny Federici and the saxophonist Clarence Clemons. "We're missing a few," Mr Springsteen said, then added, "If you're here and we're here, then they're here." In "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out," after the line "the Big Man joined the band" -- Mr. Clemons's nickname -- Mr. Springsteen stopped the music and let the applause swell and swell. When the music resumed, with what had been Mr. Clemons's saxophone line, the whole horn section played it, as if Mr. Clemons was too mighty for a single substitute. (Jake Clemons, his nephew, is now on tenor saxophone.) It was deeply respectful, and then the music surged onward. No matter how tough things get, Mr. Springsteen reaches for redemption. 
The set list:
1. "I Ain't Got No Home"
2. "We Take Care of Our Own"
3. "Wrecking Ball"
4. "Badlands"
5. "Death to My Hometown"
6. "My City of Ruins"
7. "Seeds"
8. "The E Street Shuffle"
9. "Jack of All Trades"
10. "Shackled and Drawn"
11. "Waiting on a Sunny Day"
12. "Promised Land"
13. "The Rising"
14. "We Are Alive"
15. "Thunder Road"
16. "Rocky Ground"
17. "Land of Hope and Dreams/People Get Ready"
Encores:
18. Jimmy Cliff: "The Harder They Come"
19. Jimmy Cliff: "Time Will Tell"
20. Jimmy Cliff: "Rivers of Babylon"
21. Eric Burdon: "We Gotta Get Out of This Place"
22. "Tenth Avenue Freeze Out"
23. "This Land Is Your Land"

HEADLINE: Worries for Wizards

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: As Chinese companies face auditors this year, how many frauds will be exposed? An auditor's resignation has raised a cloud over a maker of Harry Potter clothing. 

 BODY:
The Chinese company with the license to make Harry Potter clothing has run into a bit of a problem. Its auditor quit with a letter that makes it sound as if it suspects fraud.
Boshiwa International Holdings, a hot new offering in Hong Kong in 2010, said Thursday that the auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, had resigned while auditing last year's financial statements. The board said it was thinking about opening an investigation. In a further statement, it said the auditor had reported its inability to get answers that satisfied it about "the existence" of some Boshiwa distributors and suppliers, as well as the "commercial substance" of transactions involving those firms.
Paul Gillis, who writes a blog on Chinese accounting, notes that this year Chinese companies listed in the United States and using calendar years must file their annual reports by April 30, two months earlier than last year.
"We have heard this story before. In the last fraud season, most frauds were disclosed when auditors resigned. Few recover once the auditor resigns. Boshiwa's stock plunged 42% before trading was suspended. I will be surprised if it ever trades again."
Forget March Madness. Why not start a pool on how many Chinese frauds will be exposed during what Mr. Gillis calls the 2012 "fraud season"?
P.S. You can read more opinions from Mr. Gillis in my column today.

HEADLINE: Arkansas Freshman Takes Heat on Tax Proposal

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Representative Rick Crawford, Republican of Arkansas, dared to talk about a surtax on millionaires. Conservatives -- including donors -- have shown their displeasure. 

 BODY:
When Representative Rick Crawford this week broke with his Republican Party and proposed a millionaire's surtax, it was hailed in some circles as a crack in the ice that could turn into a significant breach.
So far - not so much, he says.
Mr. Crawford, a freshman from Arkansas, offered Democrats a deal - a 5 percent surtax on incomes greater than $1 million in exchange for passage of a balanced budget amendment. But it has been Republicans who have been responding, and Mr. Crawford conceded that it has not been pretty.
"The response thus far has been mostly negative with many conservatives calling for my head," he said in an e-mail. "I've had donors threaten to stop giving, and my staff has received a few acerbic e-mails. But this does not deter me because the alternative is economic calamity, taxes that will be much higher than they are today, and most likely a compromise that includes tax increases coupled with temporary spending cuts."
Mr. Crawford said that a few Republicans had privately told him they liked the idea, but that none would go public.
"I think they want to see how well I fare in the fiery furnace," he said.
Mr. Crawford's proposal comes just days before Republicans on the House Budget Committee are set to unveil a spending and tax blueprint that they say will head off fiscal calamity. 
The committee chairman, Representative Paul Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, offered a bit of a drum roll on Thursday with a video of himself walking the halls of a House office building, assuring viewers that Republicans were taking the tough decisions to head off what he called the most predictable crisis in the nation's history. 
"What if your president, your senator and your congressman knew a crisis was coming?" he asks solemnly. "What if they knew why it was happening? What if they knew what they needed to do to stop it from happening? What if they had the time to stop it? And what if they chose to do nothing about it? What would you think of that person?"
Democrats snapped back that Mr. Ryan and his party had caused the crisis with deep tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 that they now refuse to reverse, even in part.
It was that impasse that Mr. Crawford said he hoped to break, with $400 billion in deficit reduction through tax increases on the very wealthy, coupled with the long-sought amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget.
He conceded that "there is zero chance" his proposal will make it into the House budget, nor does he much care, since the budget is a nonbinding document and he wants a law. He also said bipartisan groups like the so-called Gang of Six in the Senate were working on deficit reduction plans that would ultimately raise taxes anyway without a balanced budget amendment. 
"Conservatives can howl at me if they choose," he said in his e-mail. "But ultimately they will end up with higher taxes and no permanent spending reform."
Mr. Crawford's northeastern Arkansas district, like much of the state, may be trending Republican, but it is not the safest of Congressional seats. He took it in 2010 after the retirement of Representative Marion Berry, a Democrat; the seat had been in Democratic hands since 1875, but for a single year when it went to the Labor Party of Lewis P. Featherstone. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has already begun advertising against him.

HEADLINE: In Puerto Rico, Romney Weighs In on Statehood

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: In a quick trip to Puerto Rico, Mitt Romney demonstrated that he was focused on winning the territory's Sunday primary, weighing in on the issue of statehood and English as its official language. 

 BODY:
SAN JUAN, P.R. - Mitt Romney arrived here Friday afternoon and marveled at what he described as "an aggressive and energetic - enthusiastic audience," who chanted his name and applauded as he took a makeshift stage at a private aviation terminal.
Reporters watched his charter plane touch down on the island, as a backdrop of four flags - two American and two Puerto Rican - rippled in the wind behind a podium that had been set up for him.
Mr. Romney, whose aides had originally considered a longer trip here, will spend less than 24 hours on the island in order to return to Illinois to campaign ahead of Tuesday's primary, which has grown in importance as he tries to regain some of the momentum lost after his third-place showings in this week's Southern primaries.
But while he was in the territory, Mr. Romney demonstrated that he was focused on winning its Sunday primary, weighing in on the issue of Puerto Rican statehood in his opening remarks. 
"I was asked by the governor, when he was determining whether or not I was the person he would support, about my views regarding statehood," Mr. Romney said, referring to Gov. Luis Fortuo of Puerto Rico, who met him at the airport and introduced him - in English and in Spanish - to the small assembled crowd. "And I pointed out the same thing I pointed out when I was running for office three years ago, which is that I respect the rights of Puerto Ricans to make their own decision with regards to statehood, and if they chose by majority plus one person to become a state, I will help lead the effort to provide the statehood that the citizens of Puerto Rico would seek."
When he was finished speaking, Mr. Romney took a half-dozen questions from the largely local, largely Hispanic press corps that had gathered for his arrival. Several of the questions dealt with the question of statehood, and Mr. Romney reaffirmed his view that if Puerto Ricans vote by a majority that they would like to become a state, he would help lead the effort.
Minutes later, when asked about the importance of the official language of Puerto Rico - English versus Spanish - in his decision to support statehood, Mr. Romney offered a similar response.
"I'll go back to what I said before: three or four years ago when I was running for president at that time, I have the same position now which is that I will support the people of Puerto Rico if they make a decision that they would prefer to become a state," he said. "I don't have preconditions that I would impose. I instead will stand and work with your governor to help carry out the will of the people of Puerto Rico."
The issue of the island's language, however, got Mr. Romney's chief rival, Rick Santorum, into some hot water on his visit here, when he said that to become a state, Puerto Rico would have to make English its primary language. When asked if a win in Puerto Rico's primary would be a result of Mr. Santorum's comments over the language, Mr. Romney sought to turn the topic to he was best equipped to bring "change in Washington."
"They want to see a president who understands the economy and Senator Santorum and Speaker Gingrich are fine people, but they've spent their entire career in Washington," Mr. Romney said. "And across the country and, I believe, here in Puerto Rico as well, people want a president who understands the economy."
He added: "I want to help people. I care about people. I want to use the experience I've had in the business world to help create more jobs, to bring good jobs to Puerto Rico but to do the same for the other portions of the nation."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Romney's wife, Ann -- who arrived in Puerto Rico on Thursday and attended a dinner at a Republican chairwoman's house, where she met with many of the territory's potential delegates -- appeared in Guaynabo, a city outside San Juan, with Mr. Fortuo and his wife, Luc Vela. Mr. Fortuo and the mayor of Guaynabo spoke first, both in Spanish.
When it was Mrs. Romney's turn, she talked for less than a minute. Though many of the audience members did not speak English, they applauded frequently as Mrs. Romney praised the island.
"What a beautiful island, what beautiful people," she said. "Everywhere I've gone. I've felt loved and embraced and warm. You're so gracious, thank you very much. Mitt and I are so honored to be able to stand next to Governor Fortuo and his beautiful wife."
Mrs. Romney and Ms. Vela worked their way through the crowd before taking a few informal questions from the gathered news media. Ms. Vela dodged the language question, saying only that, as the mother of triplets, "I wish they spoke more than two languages."
"Five languages, the more languages you speak, the more available you are to have a job or to have opportunities, so for me, I wish we could have more languages here in Puerto," she said.
But she did handicap Mr. Romney's changes in Puerto Rico's primary, predicting a victory.
"I'm sure that Mitt Romney will win the primary here in Puerto Rico and that he will take the 20 delegates here," she said, "so we're very excited."
And she had a few words of caution for the traveling members of the news media: "Lots of sunblock, though" she advised. "The sun here is very strong."

HEADLINE: Romney Is Endorsed by Chicago Tribune

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: The Tribune's editorial board called Mitt Romney "the Republicans' best, most responsible choice in Tuesday's Illinois primary," but Rick Santorum expressed confidence while campaigning in the state. 

 BODY:
ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. -- The Chicago Tribune endorsed Mitt Romney on Friday, four days before a primary that is seen as crucial firewall for Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor. 
But that hardly dampened the enthusiasm of around 2,000 people who turned out for Rick Santorum at a private Christian high school here.
"We're gonna win on Tuesday, whaddya think?" Mr. Santorum said, to boisterous cheers.
Mr. Santorum and The Tribune's editorial board painted starkly different portraits of Mr. Romney.
"For his demonstrated abilities and the economic pragmatism at his core, The Tribune endorses former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts as the Republicans' best, most responsible choice in Tuesday's Illinois primary," the editorial read.
In his speech in the gymnasium of the Christian Liberty Academy, Mr. Santorum cast Mr. Romney as a moderate who backed government-run health care and insurance mandates as governor and who was later dishonest about it.
"He then went out in 20 debates and told the American public he never did anything of the sort," Mr. Santorum said. "We already have someone in Washington who doesn't tell the truth. We don't need anyone else who does the same."
In this suburb of Chicago, Mr. Santorum did not repeat lines he used lately at events in rural areas about how Mr. Romney only wins in cities that any Republican nominee is likely to lose to President Obama. (That language is likely to return when he stumps in Illinois's deeply conservative downstate on Saturday.)
Mr. Santorum did, however, tell the crowd that they could "shake up this race like no state could shake it up."
"No one is expecting us to do well in Illinois," he added. "We're being outspent 10 to 1."
Mr. Romney has been spending heavily on attacking Mr. Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, including an ad that calls him an "economic lightweight."
The Tribune echoed this critique, saying that Mr. Romney's rivals can "only try to talk a good game" on fixing the economy.
"Nothing better signifies the old guard and the establishment than the newspaper editorial boards," said Jon Zahm, chairman of Mr. Santorum's Illinois effort, which he called an "outsider campaign."
Mr. Zahm added that Mr. Santorum's economic plan would add more jobs than Mr. Romney's.
But it was Mr. Santorum's position on social issues, especially his ardent opposition to abortion, that seemed to be driving people at the rally.
"He's pro-life. He's always been pro-life," said Art Ellingsen, who said he had been choosing candidates based on their abortion stance since "six months after Roe vs. Wade happened."
A Tea Party organizer in Arlington Heights, Mr. Ellingsen said he would reluctantly vote for Mr. Romney if he is the Republican nominee, just to get rid of Mr. Obama.
"He is not the king of flip-flop. That goes to a girl I knew in high school named Hillary Rodham," he said, referring to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. He noted that he had known of her work for the Goldwater campaign while they attended nearby high schools. He called Mr. Romney the "prince" of flip-flops.
Social issues also motivated the several dozen demonstrators against Mr. Santorum's opposition to gay rights standing outside the event and the half-dozen or so who were escorted out after they interrupted Mr. Santorum's remarks.

HEADLINE: In Sit-Down Restaurants, An Economic Indicator

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Have you been eating more at restaurants with waiters rather than fast-food joints?
If so, you are not alone, and that in fact is an indication that the American economy is improving.
Over the 12 months through January, sales at what the government calls full-service restaurants were 8.7 percent higher than in the previous 12 months. That was the fastest pace of growth since the late 1990s, when the economy was booming. Moreover, as is seen in the accompanying charts, that rate was much greater than the rate of growth in sales at limited-service restaurants.
Since those numbers became available 20 years ago, that difference has been a reliable indicator of how the economy is going. In tough times, people may still eat out, but they cut back. 
Full-service restaurants may or may not be expensive. Le Bernardin in Manhattan qualifies, but so does Red Lobster. The range at limited-service places is not nearly as wide.
Americans now spend about $220 billion a year at full-service restaurants, and $211 billion at the limited-service places. (They also spend $21 billion at what the government calls ''drinking places,'' also known as bars. Bar sales are now rising slower than at either type of restaurant, although history does not indicate that has any particular significance for the economy.)
To my knowledge, no previous article has pointed to the relative sales-growth figures at different types of restaurants as an economic indicator. The lack of attention from economists may be partly because of the fact that the government releases the restaurant figures on a delayed basis and does not offer seasonal adjustments for the sectors. The Census Bureau reported the January numbers this week as it reported overall retail sales for February, and most attention was focused on the fact that overall sales improved in February and that figures for the previous two months were revised upward.
As can be seen from the charts, over time the relative sales trends of the different types of restaurants have generally coincided with changes in the gross domestic product numbers. But recently, that relationship seems to have broken down, with the economy growing much more slowly than the restaurant numbers would indicate.
There is a much better-known economic relationship, known as Okun's Law, that also seems to have stopped working. That law, propounded by the late Arthur Okun, ties G.D.P. growth to changes in the unemployment rate. In late 2011, the rapid decline in the jobless rate should have been associated with strong G.D.P. growth, not the slow growth that was reported. Some commentators have suggested the law is no longer applicable and looked for reasons.
Perhaps, however, the problem lies not with Okun's Law but with the uncertainty of G.D.P. figures.
Back in 2009, there was a similar discussion of the apparent failure of Okun's Law, but in the opposite direction. Then, the unemployment rate had risen to an extent that could not be explained by the G.D.P. figures.
It turned out most of the gap was caused by bad G.D.P. numbers. At the time, the government said the economy had declined by less than 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2008. Now, after all the revisions to the G.D.P. -- revisions reflected in the accompanying chart -- the economy is believed to have shrunk by 3.3 percent in 2008.
Could it be that Okun's Law is still working, at least to a greater extent than now appears, and that both the decline in unemployment and the change in restaurant sales are providing more accurate indications of the state of the economy? If so, the benchmark revisions for the 2011 G.D.P. numbers, expected in July, could provide evidence of that.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Economic Indicator: Where You Eat: The relative sales trends of different types of restaurants provide an indication of the health of the economy. When Americans feel better about their finances, they are more likely to eat at restaurants with full service, including bringing the food to the table, rather than at restaurants with limited service. At the moment, both the restaurant sales and the falling unemployment rate indicate the economy is doing better than the Gross Domestic Product figures would seem to show.

HEADLINE: Week Ends Modestly On Soft Consumer Data

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed out its best week in three months with a slim gain on Friday as investors continued to propel equities near four-year highs.
Two slightly softer economic reports curbed broader gains, keeping the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq in modestly negative territory. The Dow broke a string of seven straight gains. Had it closed higher, it would have been the Dow's longest such run in more than a year.
The S.& P. 500 rose for a fifth straight week, gaining 2.4 percent in its best weekly performance since mid-December. Investors, buoyant over the economic outlook, have pushed the S.& P. 500 above 1,400 to its highest level since May 2008 after a surge of almost 30 percent from its most recent closing low on Oct. 3. 
Energy shares were the big gainers of the day. The S.& P. 500 energy index rose 1.2 percent in sync with a jump in crude prices, which advanced on continuing tensions over Iran's disputed nuclear program and the potential for supply disruptions in the region. Occidental Petroleum rose 1.7 percent to $100.58.
''Fundamentals are improving, corporate profits are rising, and the market has really good upward momentum,'' Stephen Wood, chief market strategist at Russell Investments in New York, said. ''I think we still have room to rise, but that said, we're keeping an eye on oil, which could be a destabilizing factor if it gets too high.''
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's preliminary reading on the overall index on consumer sentiment slipped to 74.3 from 75.3 in February, shy of economists' forecasts for a gain to 76.0 as climbing energy prices pushed inflation expectations higher for next year.
Separate data on Friday showed factory output edged higher last month, despite a fallback in auto production. Overall industrial output was flat, held back by a second straight monthly decline in mining activity.
The Dow slipped 20.14 points, or 0.15 percent, to 13,232.62 at the close. The S.& P. 500 edged up 1.57 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,404.17, its highest close since May 20, 2008. The Nasdaq composite index dipped 1.11 points, or 0.04 percent, to 3,055.26.
For the week, the Dow gained 2.4 percent and the Nasdaq was up 2.2 percent. The lion's share of the week's gains came on Tuesday, when positive comments from the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase ignited a late-day rally.
Elsewhere on the economic front, the Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index increased 0.4 percent last month after advancing 0.2 percent in January, matching expectations, while inflation pressure -- measured by the core index excluding food and energy -- remained subdued.
This week was the quarterly expiration and settlement of March equity futures and options, an event known as ''quadruple witching.'' As a result, volume was higher than it has been in recent sessions. About 7.89 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE Amex and the Nasdaq, slightly above last year's daily average of 7.84 billion.
American-listed shares of Transocean climbed 4.6 percent to $58.70 a day after it secured three new contracts at a higher rate.
Apple closed flat at $585.57 as its new iPad proved to be another hot seller on Friday. Hundreds of fans lined up at stores across Asia to be the first to get their hands on the tablet computer.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 5/32, to 97 12/32, and the yield rose to 2.30 percent from 2.28 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Fed Revises Its Numbers On Stress Test For Citigroup

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve made an error in its stress test of Citigroup that led it to overstate a crucial measurement of losses on the bank's mortgages, the central bank acknowledged on Friday. 
The Fed also issued corrections for Bank of America, Ally Financial, MetLife and Wells Fargo. It said the corrections did not change the capital ratios projected by the stress tests, which estimated the losses that a bank could bear amid situations that include a severe recession and a market meltdown.
The tests, published on Tuesday, calculated how much a bank's capital would be affected assuming losses on a range of loans and securities over a 27-month period that concludes at the end of 2013.
Still, Citigroup did not do as well as its big-bank peers in some tests. The revisions at Citigroup were for the most part bigger than the amendments at the other financial firms.
In the original test results, the Fed projected losses on Citigroup's first-lien home loans that would be equivalent to 9.7 percent of its total mortgages. But the Fed now says that the loss rate is 9.3 percent. The change occurred after the Fed moved projected losses on Citigroup's foreign mortgages to another category. As a result, the 9.3 percent loss rate is just for mortgages in the United States.
The change seems small but it signals that the Fed failed to include nearly $40 billion of foreign mortgages in its loss-rate calculation for Citigroup's mortgage.
Initially, the Fed projected $9.3 billion of losses on what looked like all of Citigroup's mortgages, producing the 9.7 percent loss-rate. The Fed appeared to be assuming that Citigroup had around $96 billion of mortgages, since $9.3 billion is 9.7 percent of $96 billion.
But securities filings show that Citigroup had $133 billion of mortgages at the end of September 2011, which was when the Fed started the test. That total combined $95 billion of American mortgages and $38 billion of international mortgages.
And something else didn't appear to add up: Applying the Fed's dollar losses of $9.3 billion to Citigroup's actual mortgage total of $133 billion produces a loss rate of 7 percent, far lower than the 9.7 percent in the original test.
That would put Citigroup more in line with the Fed-forecast mortgage loss rates of 6.7 percent for Bank of America, and 6.3 percent for JPMorgan Chase. Dropping the loss rate to 7 percent would have made Citigroup's mortgages look healthier.
Now that the Fed has corrected its results, why didn't the mortgage loss rate fall to 7 percent, instead of falling to only 9.3 percent on domestic mortgages? That seems to be because the Fed is not including foreign mortgages in that loss-rate calculation. The low projected loss rates for those loans are now counted in a category called ''other loans.''
''We will continue to work with the Federal Reserve regarding these numbers,'' a Citigroup spokesman said on Friday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: St. Patrick's to Begin $177 Million Renovation

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Take one good, long last look at St. Patrick's Cathedral, a defining landmark of New York City. It is about to disappear for two or three years under a cocoon of scaffolding, inside and out, that will permit a $177 million rehabilitation project to unfold, the most extensive work at the cathedral in generations.
Come to think of it, don't take too good a look. You may see the growing cracks in the marble facade and the patchwork of repairs up and down the buttresses, the dimness of the stained-glass windows and smoke-darkened walls, the zebra striping caused by lathing behind the plaster ceiling vaults, jerry-built vents poking out of the triforium arches along the nave, the jury-rigged cooling plant sitting in a giant plywood shed on 51st Street and the climbing-ivy accumulation of wiring and conduits around the column bases. You may even spot a chunk of stone on the cathedral grounds that has fallen from a wall above.
These and many other problems are to be addressed in the project, which is to be formally announced on Saturday by Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan as part of the celebration of St. Patrick's Day. 
''I'm talking about survival,'' the cardinal said in an interview last week. ''If we don't do something substantive for St. Patrick's Cathedral, in four or five years we're going to have to close it, because it will be dangerous.''
That may be a bit of fund-raising hyperbole. But the physical condition of St. Patrick's, which was designed by James Renwick Jr. and opened in 1879, has been a source of concern since Cardinal Edward M. Egan was archbishop and initiated the renovation project more than five years ago.
''There is actually an exponential degradation of the building,'' said Jeffrey Murphy, a partner in Murphy Burnham & Buttrick Architects, which is responsible for the renovation. ''A little crack that would cost $300 to fix initially has the potential to turn into a several thousand dollar stone replacement if left unchecked. It's not hyperbole to say that doing nothing will cause the archdiocese to spend a lot more money down the line.''
Cardinal Dolan and Mr. Murphy said the last renovation of equivalent scope occurred in the 1940s. Lesser rehabilitation was done in the 1970s.
While the cathedral will not close during the renovation, it will not look anything like itself. In the first of three phases, beginning next month, exterior scaffolding will be erected around the entire Fifth Avenue facade, all the way to the top of the spires, 330 feet above the sidewalk. It will run along the nave on both sides and then wrap around the north and south transepts - the arms in the cathedral's cruciform plan.
Interior scaffolding will rise at the west end of the nave; that is, the bays closest to the Fifth Avenue entrance. This will obscure the organ loft and the great rose window. The organ pipes in this area of the cathedral will be removed during the renovation to protect them from dust.
Cardinal Dolan said financing was in hand to cover the first phase, which will cost about $45 million. Half of the money is coming from the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, he said, and the rest from the trustees of the cathedral and from private donors.
For the second phase to begin in November and to take advantage of the scaffolding already on site, another $50 million must be raised soon. Success depends on the answers to several questions:
Will New Yorkers who disagree with the cardinal's conservative stance on social issues be able - or willing - to distinguish St. Patrick's as a civic landmark that stands apart from church teaching and archdiocesan politicking? How interested will anyone be in giving money to a landmark restoration project at a time when many basic human needs are going unmet in the city? And how much philanthropic money is out there in any case, given the state of the economy?
Cardinal Dolan allowed that some prospective donors had raised the issue of whether bricks and mortar ought to be tended to while the poor go hungry. Indeed, he said, one non-Catholic prospect said he would not contribute to the cathedral renovation, though he would give a like amount to Catholic Charities.
But the cardinal said that he hoped to persuade such donors that improving the cathedral would be a boon to the city's economy - ''Please God, hiring a lot of workers is going to help people without jobs'' - and that the cathedral's inspirational role would be strengthened, turning those who attend services into ''apostles to the poor.''
''When you have a renewed, revived, restored, repaired St Patrick's,'' Cardinal Dolan said, ''we're going to be more effectively able to preach that message of service to the poor; ergo, we're going to be able to help the poor.''
He said he had been told by more than one of the 50 or 60 potential donors whom he has personally courted that they cringed at some of the church's positions but still loved St. Patrick's enough to contribute.
The most obvious improvement visitors can expect to see, probably by early 2014, is a much brighter facade. The marble will be cleaned with a process known as Rotec vortex, using a low-pressure stream of swirling air, water and microabrasive powder. It is so gentle that one could hold a hand in front of it, said Raymond M. Pepi, the president and founder of Building Conservation Associates, consultants on the project. ''And all you'd get is a clean hand.''
Inside the cathedral - surprisingly - marble reaches only about 30 feet above the floor. In a 19th-century economy move, the builders of the interior switched from marble to a material called Beton Coignet, also known as artificial stone. Above the concrete walls are ceiling vaults of plaster. The concrete and plaster surfaces must be cleaned and repainted. An area around the ambulatory chapel of St. Andrew has been set aside for testing paint samples.
There are more than 1,300 stained-glass panels in the cathedral. About 8 percent will be removed for repair, Mr. Murphy said. The rest will be cleaned and repaired in place. A big problem is posed by protective glazing installed decades ago over the stained glass, which traps moisture and heat. One solution for the most vulnerable stained-glass panels is to set them in special frames, just far enough out of the window surrounds that they are naturally ventilated on all sides.
It is a measure of the times that the restoration team includes a security consultant, Ducibella Venter & Santore, which has handled threat assessments and protective measures for the new World Trade Center, among other potential high-profile terrorist targets. Mr. Murphy would say nothing about the security firm's recommendations for the cathedral. But the cathedral's design, set back from the street and well above the sidewalk in most places, does offer an inherent defensive advantage against vehicle-borne bombs.
Among the fund-raising leaders is Rob Speyer, the president and a co-chief executive of Tishman Speyer, whose holdings include a substantial interest in Rockefeller Center, across Fifth Avenue. Mr. Speyer has suggested the possibility, however conceptual, of tapping into Rockefeller Center's power plant, running utility lines under the street and providing heating and cooling to the cathedral.
''Rockefeller Center has surely benefited over the years from its link to St. Patrick's Cathedral,'' he said. ''I'm Jewish. We are neighbors. This is not about church politics. This is about restoring one of the city's most important landmarks. It's a responsibility we all share.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Student Loans Face Rate Rise

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
College students and their advocates are increasingly concerned about student loans, both those administered by the federal government and those made by private lenders.
On Tuesday, students rallied on Capitol Hill to protest a pending interest rate increase in subsidized loans made to low- and moderate-income undergraduates under the federal Stafford program. The rate is scheduled to increase to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent for new loans made after June 30.
How can this be? A law called the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 reduced the interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans incrementally over four academic years, from 6.8 percent at the time to the current 3.4 percent. But the rates are scheduled to jump back up on July 1, unless Congress acts to extend the current rate -- a tall order, in the charged election year political climate. (Representative Joe Courtney, Democrat of Connecticut, has introduced a bill to extend the lower rate.) 
Student advocates have been worried about the level of student debt. And they warn that the Stafford increase will further burden borrowers by adding thousands of dollars to the cost of financing a college degree. Rich Williams, higher education advocate with the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said nearly 8 million students take out the loans each year.
Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Finaid.org, said in an e-mail that the pending interest rate increase may be ''the lesser of two evils'' in the realm of student financial aid. The federal government loses money making student loans at 3.4 percent, he said, but makes a small profit at 6.8 percent. ''So a key question is whether government subsidies should be directed at keeping interest rates low or undoing cuts in the Pell grant program,'' he said. Pell grants are financial aid that also help lower-income students. But unlike loans, they don't have to be repaid and thus may have more impact on a student's decision whether to attend college than the interest rate on a loan.
Mr. Williams of PIRG argued that Congress must cast a wider net for financing, so it can pay for more Pell grants and keep loan rates low. ''The idea that rates should double,'' he said, ''is offensive.''
Meanwhile, the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is seeking complaints about loans made by private lenders. Our colleagues at The Choice recently blogged about the new system.
The consumer watchdog agency seeks to help students who may be having trouble borrowing or repaying such a loan, including borrowers who may have defaulted and had the loan sent to a debt collector. Private loans are those that aren't made or backed by the federal government. They tend to have higher interest rates and fewer borrower protections, like the right to defer the loan while serving in the military or the availability of repayment plans based on income.
The agency recently sent a letter to more than 6,000 university officials across the country, notifying them of the new complaint system, so they can direct students and alumni to the bureau for help. The bureau will coordinate with the Education Department, which oversees federal student loans, like those made under the Stafford and Perkins loan programs.
Once a complaint is submitted, the bureau said in a statement, it expected lenders to respond within 15 days with the steps they had taken or planned to take, and expected complaints to be closed in 60 days. Consumers will be given a tracking number and can check the status of their complaint on the bureau's Web site. Consumers will have the option to dispute the lender's resolution.
Have you ever had problems with a student loan, public or private? And will the pending Stafford rate increase affect you?

PERSON: Jerome Albert 

HEADLINE: Jerome Albert, 74; Helped Bring Space Age to Coney Island

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Jerome Albert, who with his father, Dewey, created and operated Astroland, the space age-themed amusement park that breathed new life into the Coney Island Boardwalk in the 1960s, a time when it was losing its lure, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 74.
The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, his wife, Carol, said. 
Astroland -- with its looping rockets, moon-flight simulations, rider-drenching water coaster and 272-foot observation tower -- was opened by the Alberts in 1962 on a 3.1-acre site at West 10th Street and Surf Avenue. Over the next 46 years, Astroland sponsored air shows, precision parachute-team jumps, rock concerts, film festivals and fireworks displays.
In 1975, Mr. Albert and his father took over operation of the nearby Cyclone roller coaster, then one of the most terrifying rides along the Boardwalk, if not in the world. Its cars reached a speed of 60 miles per hour and plunged 85 feet in the first drop.
Built in 1927, the Cyclone had been bought by New York City in 1971. After leasing the ride, the Alberts restored its rickety wood-and-steel frame and reopened it to the public. The Cyclone was designated a city landmark in 1988.
Astroland, which had no entrance fee, charged as little as 50 cents a ride when it opened and never more than about $5 over its four decades, giving it competitive strength against other amusement parks at a difficult time for Coney Island. Several hundred thousand visitors came to the park each year, according to Charles Denson, the director of the Coney Island History Project.
''The Alberts' investment turned out to be the salvation of Coney Island,'' Mr. Denson wrote in his 2011 book, ''Coney Island and Astroland.''
''The next decade,'' the book continues, ''brought the demolition of Steeplechase, a rising crime rate, urban renewal, beach pollution, fires, competition from suburban amusement parks and a civic neglect that led to a deteriorating infrastructure. Astroland became the anchor for Coney Island, the glue that held it together while many business gave up.''
But as Jerome Albert's health deteriorated (his father died in 1992), he turned over management of the park to his wife. In 2006, Ms. Albert reluctantly agreed to sell the property to the developer Joe Sitt of Thor Equities for $30 million. At the time, Mr. Sitt had plans to redevelop the entire amusement district, and Ms. Albert hoped to reopen Astroland's 35 rides at a nearby location. But by 2009, Mr. Sitt's plans had faltered and Astroland was closed.
While Jerome Albert's vision was to create what he called ''A Journey Into the 21st Century,'' the property where Astroland rose was steeped in Coney Island history. It was on that site that the restaurant owner Charles Feltman -- at least according to Boardwalk lore -- invented the hot dog in the 1870s by wrapping sausages in slices of bread.
In 1916, a former bread slicer at Feltman's Restaurant, Nathan Handwerker, opened what became Nathan's Famous hot dog emporium, two blocks west. When Mr. Handwerker wanted to relocate in 1954, he asked his friend Dewey Albert, a residential real estate developer, to be his partner in buying the Feltman property. Six years later, after deciding not to move, Mr. Handwerker sold his share to Mr. Albert.
The elder Mr. Albert brought his son, who had just graduated from New York University, into the business. It was Jerome's idea to tap into the growing fascination with space travel. He went to amusement parks in Europe and conferred with ride manufacturers.
By 1964, construction of most of the rides at Astroland was complete. There was the John Glenn Sky Ride, whose blue space capsules circled overhead, swooping between Surf Avenue and the Boardwalk. Another ride, Astroland Rocket, simulated a trip to the moon, using film images of space flight. The Deep Sea Diving Bells were submerged in a water tank among swirling dolphins. In the Water Flume, riders were drenched while strapped into imitation logs that sped through a trough.
And there was the Astrotower, with its two-story circular observation car. The New York World Telegram & Sun dubbed it ''The big bagel in the sky.'' Except for the Cyclone, which is now operated by another company under a contract with the city, only the Astrotower still stands.
Jerome Lewis Albert was born in Brooklyn on May 18, 1937, one of two children of Dewey and Adeline Weissfeld Albert. Besides his wife, the former Carol Hill, he is survived by a son, Bradley, and a grandson.
Jerome grew up in Sea Gate, on the west end of Coney Island.
''He wanted to resuscitate Coney Island,'' Mr. Denson said. ''The saying is he had sand in his shoes, and once you get sand in your shoes, you can never get it out.''

HEADLINE: Generation Y Stands Up for Itself

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The Go-Nowhere Generation,'' by Todd G. Buchholz and Victoria Buchholz (Sunday Review, March 11):
Young people are exactly right to think that luck plays a dominant factor in economic success. The return to Gilded Age levels of income disparity has laid bare the fact that very few people profit from the masses' toil, and that hard work alone is not enough to survive. We are not a timid and unambitious generation; we are realistic and disillusioned.
Also, we are perhaps the first generation to truly understand the environmental costs of America's unrelenting emphasis on independence. Driving across time zones destroys the atmosphere; setting up new households diminishes resources. Should our benchmark of success really be a car, a dishwasher, a TV, a computer, a microwave oven per person? So why decry a societal shift toward localism? What's so bad about staying rooted in your hometown and riding a bicycle to work? 
Mirroring the Obama administration's uninspiring response to the recession, many commentators are hurrying to re-establish the status quo instead of using this as an opportunity to reimagine an American society where material possessions don't define prosperity, and where success is determined not by one's bank statement but by one's contentedness.
We should all be so lucky.
TOM TORO Berkeley, Calif., March 11, 2012
The writer is a cartoonist for The New Yorker and other publications.
To the Editor:
I was disheartened to find myself and my peers caricatured in the Sunday Review as Generation Why Bother. The claim that young people are lazy and unimaginative can be addressed only through large-scale studies and careful parsing of young adults' reasons for acting as they do.
Before Todd G. Buchholz and Victoria Buchholz used the declining share of teenagers with driver's licenses as proof of laziness, they should have discussed why other forces -- hectic schedules, the scarcity of jobs for young people, the privatization of driver education and inequalities of opportunity -- cannot explain the change.
The writers seem not to have considered alternatives to the condescending assumption that millions of young Americans are ''going nowhere'' by choice.
SETH SODERBORG Ann Arbor, Mich., March 12, 2012
To the Editor:
As a senior in high school, I am alarmed by the article. From what I see, my generation is not ''sedentary.''
I founded an online journal of analysis regarding Western operations in the Middle East. I have interviewed reporters in Qatar and several former advisers to the secretary of defense, among others. I am a paid history research assistant at the University of California, Berkeley. My friends have presented scientific research to a committee of Nobel laureates, founded N.G.O.'s, volunteered in Nepal and trekked across Malawi. I could go on.
And none of us have our driver's licenses yet. Todd G. Buchholz and Victoria Buchholz would have realized that America is still ''a nation of movers and shakers'' if they had looked at teenagers who are engaged with their world.
Yes, ''we need to reward and encourage forward movement.'' But we need to recognize that it never truly stopped.
MATTHEW SCHWEITZER Oakland, Calif., March 11, 2012
To the Editor:
I was born in the Midwest, left in the early '60s, stayed in California's Bay Area until the mid-'70s (except for moving to New York, then back to California during one two-year period), lived in Manhattan until 1989 and have lived in the Catskill Mountains since.
I'm happy to be a teaching artist and director of a literary organization whose work (while never secure) takes me throughout this region and down to New York City.
I'm happy to have seen so much of our incredibly beautiful and diverse country (moving by rented truck or van with family). This stasis is hard to believe: why do young people want to just stay put, why are comfort and ease more interesting than risk and change? Are conditions ''out there'' so scary that staying at home with Mom and Dad is the better option?

HEADLINE: Tapping Equity At Lower Age

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
Reverse mortgages have always been viewed as a last resort -- something that older retirees could turn to when they desperately needed to supplement their dwindling incomes. But in the wake of the housing market's collapse and high unemployment, a new study has found that people are using reverse mortgages to alleviate more urgent financial pressures, like paying off debt. And homeowners are applying for these loans at much younger ages than they have in the past.
Reverse mortgages allow people age 62 and older to tap what may be their biggest asset, the equity in their home, without having to make any payments. Instead, the bank pays the borrowers, though they continue to be responsible for paying property taxes and homeowner's insurance. When borrowers are ready to sell (or when they die), the bank takes its share of the proceeds from the sale, and borrowers (or their heirs) receive whatever is left. 
The study, conducted by the MetLife Mature Market Institute and the National Council on Aging, analyzed data collected from reverse mortgage applicants who went through mandatory counseling sessions with government-approved counselors. The study covers 21,240 sessions from September through November 2010.
''Consumer attitudes about reverse mortgages are changing because the recession has eroded confidence about retirement security, and Americans will rely more and more on these measures,'' said Sandra Timmermann, director of the MetLife Mature Market Institute. ''As reverse mortgages do not have income requirements and since other forms of credit have become less accessible, these loans will become more attractive.''
The research found that about 21 percent of homeowners who went through counseling were 62 to 64 years old -- even though you can pull less money out the younger you are. That's a sharp rise from the 6 percent of borrowers in that age group who applied for reverse mortgages in 1999. Those findings are also consistent with a recent industry analysis that found a dramatic shift toward younger borrowers in the past few years.
And while the average age of the borrower is 73 years old, as the chart above shows, the average age of homeowners who went through the counseling was 71.5 years old. That is consistent, the study said, with the housing department's findings. ''As we look more closely at the age distribution of recent counseling clients, it appears that this broad trend may conceal the start of a major generational shift in the use of reverse mortgage loans,'' the study said.
Of homeowners who are considering a reverse mortgage, nearly 46 percent are under the age of 70, according to the study.
The vast majority of counseling clients in 2010, or 67 percent, were seeking the reverse mortgage to lower their household debt. Only 27 percent were considering it to improve their quality of life. Most recent counseling clients (67 percent) said they had a conventional mortgage that needed to be repaid if they decided to take out the mortgage, whereas 27 percent reported having both housing and nonhousing debt. Naturally, using their equity to repay the debt means they will have less left should they need to access it in the future.
For nearly one-third of counseling clients, the existing mortgage may exceed half the value of their home, the study said. That means they may not have enough equity to qualify for the mortgage, or they have to wait several years until they can qualify for a loan that's large enough to satisfy their financial needs.
Most reverse mortgages originate through the Department of Housing's Home Equity Conversion Mortgages program -- known as HECM (pronounced HECK-um) -- which has become more popular over the past 10 years. There have also been many changes to the program, including a new loan option known as the ''HECM Saver,'' which requires lower upfront fees. That version came out in October of 2010, so the study noted that its results may reflect the fact that more homeowners considered those loans, though it's unlikely that it had a major effect.
The study's authors also point out that more homeowners are likely to incorporate home equity into their retirement plans, instead of tapping it for emergencies only. ''It is likely the reverse mortgage option will be considered alongside some of the more traditional methods of saving and investment,'' said Barbara Stucki, vice president for home equity initiatives at the National Council on Aging.
The study also included a consumer guide to reverse mortgages.
At what point would you consider a reverse mortgage?

HEADLINE: Where Divorce Can Be Denied, Orthodox Jews Look to Prenuptial Contracts

BYLINE: By MARK OPPENHEIMER. 
Twitter.com/markopp1

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Before a packed house of 350 men and women at a Jewish educational center, Beverly Siegel suggested three questions that religious Jewish women should ask before divorcing: ''Do I get a get? Do I not get a get? Hmm, what kind of get should I get?''
Ms. Siegel, a Chicago filmmaker, was screening her 2011 documentary, ''Women Unchained,'' about Jewish women whose husbands refuse to give a religious divorce known as a get. Less religious Jews divorce with no thought to the get. But in traditional Judaism, the husband may withhold the divorce. The women are considered agunot, or ''chained wives.'' A recent survey found that between 2005 and 2010, there were 462 cases of agunot in North America. 
Even if she has obtained a civil divorce, a chained wife, or agunah, cannot remarry within the faith. If she does, children from her new marriage carry a stigma forever. In exchange for a get, husbands often demand reduced alimony, favorable child-custody arrangements, even cash payouts.
Ms. Siegel became interested in agunot after a friend from synagogue told her that his daughter was being refused a get. The friend eventually had to cover his son-in-law for more than $400,000 to secure the get, including paying outstanding mortgage and credit-card bills.
In prewar European villages, a man might answer his door to find muscled goons hired by his father-in-law to encourage him, so to speak, to release his wife. In Israel today, some reluctant husbands are jailed until they issue gets. But in the United States, secular courts cannot interfere in a religious divorce, and violence is likely to result in an arrest, as in the case of a Lakewood, N.J., couple apprehended last July for arranging the kidnapping and beating of a man who refused to give a get. So, some are promoting a more civilized solution.
During a discussion after ''Women Unchained,'' Ms. Siegel urged Jewish couples to sign the prenuptial agreement devised 20 years ago by the Beth Din of America, a leading Orthodox religious court.
Couples who sign the Beth Din of America halakhic prenuptial agreement -- ''halakhah'' means Jewish law -- agree to have all religious aspects of their divorce decided by a Jewish court. More important, the husband agrees that if the couple separates, he will pay his wife $150 per day until they are religiously divorced, adjustable for inflation. In other words, he will support his wife until he gives her a get, which is the Hebrew word for the Jewish divorce document.
There are many versions of the religious prenuptial agreement, but the one promoted by the Beth Din of America, which is based in New York, seems most widely used. Asked how many couples sign the agreement, Rabbi Shlomo Weissmann, the court's director, said not enough.
''The goal would be to have it universally adopted across the entire Orthodox community,'' Rabbi Weissmann said by telephone. ''Repeatedly and consistently, even in extremely adversarial situations, the prenup has worked to prevent agunah situations and the improper use of the get in divorce negotiations.''
In 2006, the Rabbinical Council of America, a separate organization affiliated with the Beth Din of America, passed a resolution encouraging rabbis not to perform a wedding without a halakhic prenuptial agreement. About two years ago, Rabbi Weissmann said, a Beth Din of America survey found that about 70 percent of its affiliated rabbis required or encouraged couples to use the document.
''There certainly are segments of the Orthodox Jewish community that have not embraced it,'' Rabbi Weissmann said. ''When we talk about wedding practices, these are ancient and sacred practices, and when you start tinkering with them, people start getting nervous.''
Hannah Scholl, 23, a graduate of Stern College, an Orthodox women's school in Manhattan, is not married, but she encourages her religious friends to use the halakhic prenuptial agreement. It is not always an easy sell, she said.
''I have a friend who is bright, who has considered that not everything will end up perfectly,'' Ms. Scholl said last week, hours before the Jewish holiday of Purim. ''And I have been badgering her about signing a prenup. I think there's this discomfort with it in the more right-wing community, because it is considered innovative on some level.''
And talking about a prenup can seem like a bad omen, Ms. Scholl said. ''Some people are uncomfortable with it because they feel, 'Why are you starting a marriage thinking along the lines of it dissolving?' ''
Ms. Scholl is one organizer of a social media campaign on behalf of the country's most famous agunah, Tamar Epstein. Ms. Epstein is still religiously married to Aharon Friedman, tax counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee. They were separated in March 2008, and she received a civil divorce in April 2010.
But Mr. Friedman has refused to give her a get. Their case has been covered by The New York Times, Politico.com and The Huffington Post. At public events, Ms. Epstein has encouraged women to sign halakhic prenuptial agreements.
During the panel discussion at Spertus, a Jewish educational center near Grant Park in Chicago, Rabbi Gedalia Dov Schwartz, who is featured in ''Women Unchained,'' mentioned one possible hope for chained wives: an annulment.
If a marriage began under false pretenses, Rabbi Schwartz said in a telephone interview, it can be considered never to have taken place. Such a case might involve a spouse's failure to disclose homosexual tendencies, an abusive streak or a gambling addiction.
''If he had this addiction,'' Rabbi Schwartz said this week, ''and he had covered it up, and once they get married, he goes through his money, his wife's money, he cleans out her accounts, he's gambling it away, he goes to the casinos, and back and forth -- that's a deception.''
Rabbi Schwartz cautioned that for an annulment to occur, a spouse's flaw must have been present but hidden before the marriage. In the end, the prenuptial agreement matters because a rabbi can do only so much.
''I can't break the law,'' Rabbi Schwartz said -- although others sometimes do. He said he had recently met a Russian Jewish immigrant from a ''semi-Hasidic'' community. ''I was talking in his presence about the problem of the chained women,'' the rabbi said, ''and he said in Yiddish, 'What's the problem? We don't have a problem! We beat them up.' ''

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Surge to a 10-Month High

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Consumer prices rose to a 10-month high in February as the cost of gasoline spiked, the Labor Department said Friday, but there was little sign that underlying inflation pressures were building up.
Surging gasoline prices hurt consumer confidence early this month, other data showed on Friday. Still, Americans apparently do not believe the sharp run-up in prices will last.
The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 percent in February after advancing 0.2 percent in January. Gasoline accounted for more than 80 percent of the rise. 
Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core C.P.I., edged up just 0.1 percent.
''Consumer purchasing power, at least for the next few months, is going to remain pressured by rising gasoline prices,'' Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, N.C., said. However, he said a trend toward lower inflation was still in place.
Consumer prices rose 2.9 percent last month from the same period a year ago, unchanged from January but down from a peak of 3.9 percent in September. The core index was up 2.2 percent over the 12 months through February, down from 2.3 percent in January.
Rising gasoline prices helped pull the preliminary Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index on consumer sentiment down to 74.3 early this month from 75.3 in February.
Consumer expectations for inflation one year ahead jumped to 4 percent from 3.3 percent, but the five-year reading rose only slightly to 3 percent and the survey's director said Americans did not expect the steep climb in gasoline costs to last.
''Over all, the data indicate that $4 gasoline has lost its shock value, although the drain on discretionary income will still affect spending, mostly among lower-income households,'' said Richard T. Curtin, the survey's director.
Investor expectations of inflation, as signaled by spreads in the bond market, have also been on the rise, supported by a stream of relatively upbeat economic data. However, they fell back a bit after the consumer prices report.
Other data on Friday showed the economy continued to expand moderately. Production at the nation's mines, factories and utilities held steady last month after a 0.4 percent gain in January, the Fed said.
Manufacturing output rose 0.3 percent, even as automakers cut production by 1.1 percent after two big monthly gains. Carmakers had raised production to meet demand for popular models in short supply.
The consumer price report showed gasoline prices soared 6 percent last month, the largest increase since December 2010. They had risen 0.9 percent in January. While the strengthening jobs market is providing some cushion against rising gas prices at the pump, salaries are not keeping up.
Average weekly earnings, adjusted for inflation, fell 0.3 percent last month after slipping 0.1 percent in January, the Labor Department said. Compared with February last year, weekly earnings were down 0.4 percent.
But there was some price relief for households. Food costs held steady in February, the first time in a year and half they did not rise, and apparel prices dropped the most since July 2006.
There were also declines in the prices of tobacco, airline tickets and used cars and trucks. But new motor vehicle prices recorded their first increase in nine months, reflecting rising domestic demand for autos.
''The downward trajectory for consumer price inflation remains largely intact,'' Millan Mulraine, a senior macro strategist at TD Securities in New York, said.

HEADLINE: How Charter Schools Can Hurt

BYLINE: By LUCINDA ROSENFELD. 
Lucinda Rosenfeld is the author of ''I'm So Happy for You.''

 BODY:
MY daughter is a kindergarten pupil at P.S. 261 in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. She started there in September, and she loves everything about it: her friends, her teachers and her school-related activities, like Girl Scouts. Intense excitement accompanied both the post office project earlier this year and the Halloween Day Characters Parade, in which her class dressed up as the Three Little Pigs.
A few weeks ago, for three days in a row starting at 3 p.m., a representative from the Success Academy charter school that is scheduled to open this fall in adjacent Cobble Hill stood outside the doors of P.S. 261, handing out fliers and attempting to recruit its students. On day two, outraged teachers asked the man to leave. He refused. On day three, a loose group of teachers, parents and students occupied the sidewalk next to him. Heated words were exchanged. It wasn't until the next day, when a schoolwide rally unfolded in the front yard -- and cameras from NY1 arrived -- that the representative vanished. I can't help wondering if this is the educational future that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg had in mind when, in his State of the City address earlier this year, he called for 50 new charter schools to open in the next two years. 
Here in the Brownstone Belt, most elementary schools are overwhelmingly populated either by poor minorities or middle- to upper-middle-class whites. P.S. 261 is one of a minority of Brooklyn primary schools that manages to be truly diverse -- racially, ethnically and economically. While 35 percent of its student body qualifies for free lunch, it also attracts and retains children from professional families of all races and creeds, who work in law, media and the arts.
If Success Academy succeeds in luring away even a fraction of 261's students, however, it could well create a snowball effect in which its middle-class population ends up fleeing. In New York City, school budgets are determined in part by the number of students who attend. So fewer kids at P.S. 261 would mean less money for the principal to spend on everything from teachers to class trips.
At the moment, P.S. 261 is doing pretty well. Just recently, the Trust for Public Land selected the school to have its playground renovated, while a science teacher, Carmelo Piazza (otherwise known as ''Carmelo the Science Fellow,'' a Brooklyn legend in his own right), received a $10,000 grant from AT&T to refurbish his lab, which will soon be filled with small reptiles.
For reasons understood only by the statistics-mad New York City Department of Education, P.S. 261 recently received a letter grade of ''C.'' It was also designated as a ''school in need of improvement.'' But so far, in my book, considering budget cuts that have wiped out close to a million dollars in three years and forced the school library to close for lack of a librarian, the place deserves an A or A-minus.
Other schools nearby could use help as well. Instead of sending taxpayer funds to another Success Academy, why not use that same money to try to turn some of Brooklyn's less popular elementary schools into institutions that, like P.S. 261, attract parents from across the socioeconomic spectrum? In studies, a mix of rich and poor has been shown to lift up those at the bottom of the economic pile. As for the children of professional families, it's surely better for them not to spend their entire lives around people exactly like them.
The apparent reason for opening a charter school in a gentrified neighborhood like Cobble Hill (or the Upper West Side, where a Success Academy opened last year) is to bring more middle-class and upper-middle-class families into the publicly funded charter system. But if the Success Academy succeeds in its mission, it could well end up destroying schools like P.S. 261 that already succeed in attracting these families. My daughter's new friends include the children of both marketing executives and maintenance workers. At drop-off recently, I watched as she and a friend who lives in a nearby housing project walked hand in hand down the hall. In its promise of a more just world, the sight made me almost teary-eyed. I wonder how much longer those kinds of scenes will prevail.
The communities of Boerum Hill and Cobble Hill overwhelmingly do not support a charter in the neighborhood. (The same is true in Williamsburg, where, despite a huge outcry, another Success Academy was recently rubber-stamped.) This has been made abundantly clear at both community meetings and those for the Panel for Educational Policy. Perhaps the mayor believes he knows better than the thousands of families who have come out to voice their opposition. But then, wasn't the whole point of the ''school choice'' movement to give power back to the parents?
There's nothing wrong with providing families with options. When charters open in their own privately financed, state-of-the-art buildings in poverty-stricken neighborhoods where they're welcomed by the community, there may be reasons to celebrate. But when charters co-locate in mixed-income areas, choice is only half the story.
The existing schools in which they set up shop suffer both in terms of resources (only so many kids can fit in the lunchroom at one time) and morale. If the Cobble Hill Success Academy opens as planned in the Brooklyn School for Global Studies, which also houses a second high school and a special-needs program, in five years the building will be at 108 percent capacity -- unless, of course, the other schools shrivel up and die.
Call us paranoid, but parents like me are starting to wonder whether Mayor Bloomberg's larger goal isn't to privatize the entire New York City public school system. Why else would he be foisting charters on communities that don't want them? And how else can he justify diverting tax dollars to organizations that employ people to blanket neighborhoods with advertisements and try to poach students from public schools that are already thriving?

HEADLINE: Price of Gas Matters to Voters, But Doesn't Seem to Sway Votes

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; Sabrina Tavernise contributed reporting from Franklin and Springfield, Ohio.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Stacy Hawks is angry that the rising price of gasoline is squeezing the profits of her father's produce company and draining the wallets of friends who drive trucks. She is angry that the government has not acted to reverse the trend.
But Ms. Hawks, 26, a North Carolina resident who describes herself as very conservative, said she does not expect the price of gas to influence her vote in November.
''What I look for in a candidate is whether or not they have experience, values, morals,'' said Ms. Hawks. ''Mostly, I want someone that I trust as a leader.''
There may be no number stamped more frequently on the American landscape than the price of gas. And as the average price has climbed toward $4 a gallon nationwide, it has generated abundant chatter about the threat to the economic recovery, and to incumbent politicians. 
Republicans have seized on the issue to attack President Obama's management of the economy. The president has responded with speeches defending his energy policies, including increased domestic oil production.
But there is surprisingly little evidence that gas prices deserve an outsize reputation for economic and political influence.
Studies suggest that most voters agree with Ms. Hawks: they are angry about gas prices, but other factors, like the economy and the personal qualities of candidates, ultimately determine their votes.
Gas prices influence voters indirectly, because rising prices can slow the pace of growth. But the influence is modest, because spending on oil and its derivatives makes up only a small part of the nation's economic activity. Gas purchases account for less than 4 percent of household spending. Prices would need to increase by at least 28 percent to lift that share by a single percentage point. So far this year, they have jumped by 15 percent.
''Presidential elections are based on evaluations of presidential performance and on the performance of the economy. You can't reduce that to one small issue,'' said Alan Abramowitz, a professor of political science at Emory University. ''Are gas prices part of the equation that people think about? They probably are, but only a small piece.''
Rising gas prices also make Americans less confident in the nation's economic prospects and less approving of political leaders, according to public opinion surveys. But these, too, are small effects. One study by a political scientist estimated that the impact of changes in unemployment was 27 times greater than the impact of equivalent changes in gas prices.
In part, the difference is that Americans are divided as to whether politicians should be held responsible.
Donald J. Wheeler, a ball bearing tester from Springfield, Ohio, said people blamed the president because it was the easiest thing to do. ''It's ridiculous,'' he said. ''In my opinion, it's the companies that are gouging people.''
Brian Gregory, who delivers auto parts in northern Virginia, spends about $60 most weekdays filling his station wagon. He said that he blamed Mr. Obama for failing to control prices and that the issue was a major reason he planned to vote ''either for a Republican or not at all.''
''I don't understand health care as well as I should,'' he said. ''Housing, I'm kind of vague on that. But this I can definitely understand.''
Gas prices exert an unrivaled hold on the public imagination. Americans spend more on gas than on almost any other single good, and the exact amount is hard to miss as the numbers spin by on the pump. It hurts to watch, but there is also little choice. People can substitute chicken for steak, but they still need to drive the same distance to work.
When prices rise, people wait to buy cars; they travel less; they buy fewer lottery tickets and spend less on child care, according to a study by Paul Edelstein and Lutz Kilian, economics professors at the University of Michigan.
Michael Wills has stopped driving weekly from his home in Fairfax, Va., to his father's home in North Beach, Md., a distance of 50 miles. Mr. Wills, 56, said he had seen his father only a few times in recent months.
Amy Rivera, 24, of Orlando, said she shorted her electric bill last month to make sure she had enough money for gas.
And Pat Rosenbeck, 57, a restaurant owner from Franklin, Ohio, said the flow of customers had slowed as gas climbed above $3 a gallon.
The impact on happiness is even larger than the changes in spending, according to a 2010 study by researchers at the Brookings Institution, in part because people do not like uncertainty, and they do not know how high prices will climb.
Republican primary voters overwhelmingly cite gas prices as an important issue. But voters' views of a president are influenced by a wide range of issues.
Rising gas prices sometimes track declines in presidential approval ratings. Gallup reported that President George W. Bush's ratings fell to 48 percent at the end of October 2004, just before Election Day, from 60 percent in January. The price of a gallon of regular gas climbed 27 percent over the same period.
But gas prices often move out of sync with approval ratings, too. President Bill Clinton's ratings rose to 54 percent just before Election Day from 42 percent in early January 1996, even as the price of gas climbed 13 percent.
Since 1976, a 30-cent increase in gas prices over a three-month period has corresponded to a reduction of two percentage points in a president's approval rating if other economic factors are held constant, according to an analysis by John Sides, a professor of political science at George Washington University.
That kind of movement has not been sufficient to affect the outcome of a presidential election, he said. ''I think of the information flow that takes place during a presidential campaign as a big, wide Mississippi River, and gas prices are a tributary that flows into that river,'' Professor Sides said. ''It's hard for one number, even if it's staring you in the face while you're pumping gas, to burn through all the other information that's out there about the economy and the candidate.''
A key implication, however, is that gas prices could make a difference if the movements were large enough and the race was close enough.
A 2011 study of the impact of economic conditions on regional voting patterns found that the spike in gas prices in the summer of 2008 did give a small boost to Mr. Obama. Independent voters in areas where prices climbed highest reported a significantly more negative view of the health of the economy and were less likely to vote for incumbents.
James Gimpel, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland who was a co-author of the study, said the increased volatility of gas prices was raising its importance in elections. ''It may well be that this is an emerging factor that we'll have to consider,'' he said. ''But if I can rely on that old social sciences copout, we need more evidence.''

HEADLINE: Long-Term Question Marks

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
There just hasn't been a lot of good news about long-term care insurance lately. Private insurers have been dropping the product, and the Obama administration announced last fall that it was scrapping plans for a federally sponsored option. 
The latest? The American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance says its yearly analysis of popular policies offered by 10 big insurers finds that prices for such policies have risen by as much as 17 percent from a year ago.
The average annual cost for a single 55-year-old in good health is $1,720, for $165,000 to $200,000 of current coverage, the association says. Last year, the same coverage would have cost $1,480.
The analysis priced policies that included a 3 percent compound inflation growth factor, because consumers need to be sure the benefits they buy today keep pace with rising costs, said Jesse Slome, the association's executive director.
Mr. Slome attributed the premium increases to continued low interest rates and middling yields on fixed-income investments, which make it difficult for insurers to earn enough from investing the premiums they collect to pay future claims. ''It's the cumulative impact - and looking ahead,'' he said, noting that the Federal Reserve has indicated that interest rates will not rise much through 2014.
Mr. Slome said that insurance companies were pricing their products correctly. ''The problem is, it's an expensive product,'' he said.
The cost of the premiums offered by different companies for comparable coverage varied widely, though, so comparison shopping is important, Mr. Slome said.
Roughly eight million people carry some kind of long-term care coverage, according to the association's data.
Do you carry long-term care insurance? If you do, have your premiums increased?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Good, Bad and Ugly Of Capitalism

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
On Wednesday, Howard Schultz, the chairman and chief executive of Starbucks, will take the podium at his company's annual meeting and talk about the importance of morality in business.
Yes, morality. I don't know that he'll use that exact word. But there can be little doubt that in recent years, especially, Schultz has been practicing a kind of moral capitalism. Profitability is important, he believes, but so is treating customers, employees and coffee growers fairly. Recently, Schultz has defined Starbucks's mission even more broadly, creating programs that have nothing at all to do with selling coffee but are aimed at helping the country recover from the Great Recession.
In the speech, Schultz plans to make a direct link between Starbucks's record profits and this larger societal role the company has embraced. He will make the case that companies that earn the country's trust will ultimately be rewarded with a higher stock price. ''The value of your company is driven by your company's values,'' he plans to say. 
I bring up Schultz and Starbucks because this week we saw a different kind of American capitalism on display -- the ''rip your eyeballs out'' capitalism of Goldman Sachs. In the corporate equivalent of the shot heard round the world, Greg Smith, a former Goldman executive, wrote an Op-Ed article in The Times as he was walking out the door in which he described a corporate culture that values only one thing: making as much money as possible, by whatever means necessary. According to Smith, Goldman views clients as pigeons to be plucked rather than customers to be valued. Goldman traders vie to see how much profit they can make at the expense of their clients, even if it means selling them products that are sure to ''blow up'' eventually. ''It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping their clients off,'' Smith wrote.
In the wake of Smith's article, plenty of people raced to Goldman's defense. Michael Bloomberg, New York's billionaire mayor, whose company sells Goldman expensive computer terminals, went to Goldman Sachs's headquarters in a show of support. The editors of his eponymous firm published an editorial that mercilessly mocked Smith. They and others pointed out that Goldman clients are big boys who can take care of themselves. Even some clients agreed. ''You better not turn your back on them,'' one Goldman customer told The Financial Times. Yet, he added, ''They are also highly competent.''
But there's a reason Smith's article has struck such a chord. It is the same reason that Goldman Sachs, despite having come through the financial crisis largely unscathed, has become the target of such astonishing venom, described as a vampire squid and the like. The reason is that the kind of amoral, eat-what-you-kill capitalism that Goldman represents is one that most Americans instinctively find repugnant. It confirms the suspicions many people have that Wall Street has become a place where sleazy practices are the norm, and where generating profits in ways that are detrimental to society is the ticket to a successful career and a multimillion-dollar bonus.
Goldman bundled terrible subprime mortgages that helped bring about the financial crisis. Smelling trouble, it unloaded its worst mortgage bonds by cramming them down the throats of its clients. It secretly allowed a short-seller, John Paulson, to pick some especially toxic mortgage bonds that were bundled and sold to Goldman clients -- with Paulson profiting by taking the ''short'' side of the trade. Just recently, Goldman had to admit that one of its investment bankers had acted as a merger adviser to the El Paso Corporation while holding stock in Kinder Morgan, which was trying to acquire El Paso. It would be hard to imagine a more blatant conflict -- yet no one at Goldman bothered to tell El Paso.
These practices may not be illegal, but can you really say they represent the values that we want to see on Wall Street or in our corporations? I can't.
And Goldman shouldn't either. What has been amazing is that, despite three years of nonstop criticism -- including Congressional hearings and settlements with the government -- Goldman has not changed one iota. That is another reason Smith's article resonated. It confirmed that suspicion as well. Goldman's response to every controversy these past three years has been to bury them in a blizzard of public relations. And this has been its response to the Smith article, releasing, for instance, a companywide e-mail from Lloyd Blankfein, its chief executive, insisting that Goldman does, too, care about clients. Consistently, Goldman's attitude has been: This, too, shall pass.
So far, though, it hasn't. And maybe, just maybe, it won't. Maybe the time has come for Blankfein to watch what Howard Schultz is doing at Starbucks. Sometimes, the best way to do well really is to do good.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Leaders Attack Democratic Senator, But Leave Candidate Selection to the Primary

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
ROCHESTER -- As New York Republicans gathered on Friday to begin choosing a candidate for the United States Senate, they directed sharp attacks at the Democratic incumbent, Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, accusing her of blindly following President Obama and having an unremarkable record after three years in office.
Posters throughout the convention center here were designed like Wild West wanted posters and offered a $1,000 reward ''for anyone who can find Kirsten Gillibrand's core convictions.'' 
She ''has been in lock step with Obama since Day 1,'' said William D. Reilich, a Republican assemblyman who is also chairman of the Monroe County Republican Party.
The convention approved three candidates who will face off in a June 26 statewide primary -- Wendy E. Long, a Manhattan lawyer active in conservative circles; George Maragos, the Nassau County comptroller; and Representative Bob Turner, a congressman who represents portions of Brooklyn and Queens. A fourth potential candidate, Joe Carvin, the Rye Town supervisor, withdrew before the convention began.
Ms. Long won the greatest support from county delegates gathered here, but the convention did not endorse any of the candidates; primary votes will choose the nominee.
Republicans acknowledged that they had an uphill fight seeking to unseat Ms. Gillibrand. She is a well-financed candidate in a state where Democrats have a strong registration advantage and voter turnout is likely to be high during a presidential election year. No Republican has won a statewide election in New York since George E. Pataki was elected to a third term as governor in 2002.
But Republican Party activists at the convention said they saw an opening this year because of what they characterized as President Obama's unsuccessful economic policies.
''This is a year where the people of New York understand that Washington has failed us and they understand that we need people who are going to bring a new approach and not just continue the Washington insider special interest nonsense that has really hurt our country,'' Mr. Pataki told reporters after delivering the keynote address.
As they seek to reassert themselves at the statewide level, Republicans are grappling with competing visions of how to define their party.
While some Republicans believe the party must push candidates who can connect with moderate voters, others favor solid conservatives.
The party was rattled two years ago when Carl P. Paladino, a feisty Buffalo millionaire, won a primary upset to become the Republican nominee for governor. He lost the race to Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat.
''I believe we're a party looking to find its way,'' said Nicholas A. Langworthy, the Republican chairman for Erie County. ''We're looking for that victory. We're looking for an opportunity, and we're gravitating toward candidates that are more conservative.''
Ms. Long is largely unknown to the public, but has generated considerable excitement among party regulars. She is articulate and charismatic, and seen as someone who could foil Ms. Gillibrand.
She is also a strong social conservative who has spoken out against same-sex marriage, saying it could open the door for humans to marry animals. Ms. Long has been linked to a student newspaper at Dartmouth, her alma mater, that mocked gays, blacks and Jews. Her supporters cheered the loudest during the voting process, but some Republicans worried about her electability.
''I'm a 1980s Ronald Reagan conservative, and Ronald Reagan won this state two times,'' Ms. Long said. ''I don't think that those conservative values are out of step with New York at all.''
Ms. Long described Ms. Gillibrand as ''someone who just rubber-stamps the Obama agenda or checks with Chuck Schumer and says, 'Me too.' ''
The best-known candidate is Mr. Turner, who won a high-profile special election last year to replace Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat who resigned over an online sex scandal. Mr. Turner announced his intention to run on Tuesday, after it became clear that the Congressional district he represents would most likely be eliminated by redistricting. His supporters argued Friday that he was the most electable Republican candidate, and they said that he would be most able to raise the money needed to take on Ms. Gillibrand. (Mr. Turner estimated the cost of the race at about $15 million.)
Mr. Turner said he took pride in the fact that Ms. Gillibrand quickly attacked him after he announced he would enter the race.
''She knows this is where the problem will be if she's going to lose,'' Mr. Turner said.
The candidates, despite their differences, were united in their attacks against Ms. Gillibrand.
''I think she is very vulnerable,'' Mr. Turner said. ''As a senator, she has one of the most undistinguished records there. She is saddled with high taxes, our deficit, Obamacare and I can go on and on.''
Ms. Gillibrand ''has failed to protect our financial industry in New York,'' Mr. Maragos said, adding that ''she has had no voice on our critical foreign policy issues.''
Jay Jacobs, the New York State Democratic chairman, denounced the criticism.
''Unfortunately, these kinds of false political attacks are to be expected at a convention in chaos where G.O.P. candidates are even spreading false rumors about each other,'' Mr. Jacobs said in a statement. ''Senator Gillibrand has been a true champion for New York families and is solely focused on finding bipartisan common sense solutions to grow our economy for the middle class and seeing 'Made in America' again across New York State.''

HEADLINE: With a Visit To Goldman, Mayor Says, Chin Up

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg thought Goldman Sachs could use a friend.
The mayor, who earned billions on Wall Street and has a reputation as a staunch defender of corporate culture, dropped by the investment bank's Manhattan headquarters on Thursday in an unannounced show of solidarity that included handshakes on the trading floor and burgers with the chief executive.
Mr. Bloomberg's hourlong visit, first disclosed by the mayor's eponymous news agency, came as Goldman struggled to cope with an onslaught of negative publicity after a former executive's scathing Op-Ed article in The New York Times accused the firm of wanton greed and excess. 
The mayor, who suggested the appearance in a phone call to the bank's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, couched his visit as a necessary pick-me-up for a down-on-its-luck city institution.
''It's my job to stand up and support companies that are here in this city that bring us a tax base and that employ our people,'' Mr. Bloomberg said on his weekly radio show on Friday. He castigated the news media for ''piling on'' the bank, saying ''ridiculous isn't even the right word'' to describe the coverage.
But for a mayor who is regularly accused of being out of touch -- and who riled some last year when he argued that Congress, and not big banks, was to blame for the financial crisis -- the event may have simply been a moment of earnest, uncalculated honesty.
''It's from the gut,'' Kenneth Sherrill, a professor of political science at Hunter College, said of the visit. ''These are his people, and he felt their pain.''
Mr. Sherrill found Mr. Bloomberg's response to the Goldman controversy to be ultimately a humanizing one.
''I don't think he's thinking for one minute about political issues or anything else,'' Mr. Sherrill said. ''I know this sounds strange, but running to cheer up the people at Goldman Sachs shows what's in his heart. I think that's what happened.''
Mr. Bloomberg's ties to the securities industry are both sentimental and self-interested. He began his career at Salomon Brothers, the defunct investment firm, and his fortune flows from the Bloomberg financial data terminals used on Wall Street.
Goldman, in fact, has been a key contributor to Mr. Bloomberg's wealth: the firm leases thousands of Bloomberg terminals, sending tens of millions of dollars a year to the mayor's private company.
Mr. Bloomberg has hired former Goldman executives for his administration, and he is friendly with Mr. Blankfein from the city's charity and social circuits. In 2003, one of Mr. Blankfein's sons spent several weeks as an intern at City Hall.
A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the visit.
Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said on Friday that many of the city's finance workers earn salaries below six figures.
''When the entire industry gets unfairly painted with the same brush, people working hard at middle-class jobs get hurt,'' he wrote in an e-mail. ''That's why the mayor wanted to go talk to them.''
Some New Yorkers, however, said the mayor had struck a decidedly non-populist note.
''It shows a tin ear for the big realities of the city,'' said Richard Brodsky, a former Democratic state assemblyman. ''There is a growing popular concern about the greed and the misbehavior in the investment banking community.''
The author of the Op-Ed article, Greg Smith, 33, resigned on Wednesday from his post in London and has not commented since. Executives at Goldman issued a fierce rejoinder, circulating a memorandum that defended the company's devotion to its clients and corporate ethics.
Mr. Smith's column clearly left an impression on Mr. Bloomberg. On Friday's radio show, the mayor said he was particularly aggrieved by the idea of a former employee lashing out his former firm, behavior that is considered sacrilege in the financial industry.
''You know, you go to work for a company, it seems to me, they have an obligation to never dis you,'' the mayor said. ''They can part company with you, but they should never do that, nor should an employee ever walk away after being there for so long.''
Mr. Bloomberg prizes loyalty, and he has written of his contempt for colleagues who choose to leave. ''When someone departs, those of us who stay are hurt,'' Mr. Bloomberg wrote in his 1997 memoir. ''They've become bad people. Period.''

HEADLINE: The Future Is Another Country

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: And it can't be used to justify bad policy now. 

 BODY:
Simon Wren-Lewis has another very good blog post, this time on the very weak case for demanding fiscal austerity right now, even if you believe fiscal consolidation is needed in the long run. I want to tie this together with Brad DeLong's preview of DeLong-Summers on fiscal policy in a liquidity trap.
What Wren-Lewis says, and Delong-Summers argue at greater length, is that there is very little direct connection between spending over the next couple of years and long-run fiscal prospects. Between low borrowing costs and high multipliers, spending now would do little to worsen the debt picture a decade from now; indeed, as DeLong-Summers argue (and some of us have been arguing, less formally, for a while now), there's a plausible case that spending more now actually improves the long-run fiscal picture -- and that austerity worsens it.
So what's the counter-argument? Aside from deeply flawed arguments about crowding out even with zero interest rates, what you usually encounter are assertions that there is no such thing as a temporary spending increase -- and the related claim is that spending cuts now will signal spending restraint over the long term too. Such statements are invariably made with an air of worldly wisdom -- hey, we all know that stimulus spending never goes away when it's supposed to.
But do we know that? Actually, all the evidence says the reverse. Did the Works Progress Administration survive into the 1950s? No. Have the provisions of the Recovery Act been made permanent? Not a chance.
Nor, as Wren-Lewis says, is there any good reason to believe that fiscal austerity now will persist when times are better. A prime example is what happened to the de facto austerity of the 1990s, when spending restraint in the face of a booming economy finally moved the US government into surplus. Without a moment's hesitation, George W. Bush rushed to squander that hard-won surplus on tax cuts and an unfunded war. 
To a first approximation, in other words, the effect of current fiscal policy -- whether stimulus or austerity -- an the actions of future governments is zero. And what that means is that stimulus and/or austerity should be considered on their direct merits, a comparison that makes a strong case for stimulus while revealing austerity as a (literally) unmitigated disaster.

HEADLINE: Out of N.B.A., Working for U.S.A.

BYLINE: PETER MAY


HIGHLIGHT: When Mike Krzyzewski takes a seat on the United States men's basketball bench during the London Olympics this summer, he could well be joined by two unemployed assistants but no coaches with N.B.A. jobs on a team full of N.B.A. players. 

 BODY:
When Mike Krzyzewski takes a seat on the United States bench to lead a team full of N.B.A. players at the London Olympics this summer, he could well be joined by two unemployed assistants but no coaches with N.B.A. jobs.
The former Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni and the former Portland Trail Blazers coach Nate McMillan are the two coaches with N.B.A. experience on the national team's staff. The other assistant is Syracuse's Jim Boeheim. Krzyzewski is Duke's coach.
D'Antoni and McMillan joined the unemployed ranks last week. D'Antoni resigned Wednesday, and his team beat McMillan's Trail Blazers by 42 points that night. McMillan was fired Thursday.
Neither move affected the coaches' standing on the national team staff, said Craig Miller of USA Basketball.
"They've been with us since 2006, and they meet all the selection criteria," Miller said in a phone interview.
The criteria, according to USA Basketball, include three years of coaching experience at the time of selection as well as experience in international basketball. D'Antoni, who played and coached in Italy, was the coach of the Phoenix Suns when he joined Krzyzewski's staff.
McMillan and D'Antoni could land new N.B.A. jobs by the time the United States team opens training camp in Las Vegas in July. McMillan's name has been linked to a possible opening in Charlotte, should the Bobcats make a change. He played at North Carolina State.
The current four-man coaching staff for the national team was selected in 2006 after Jerry Colangelo took over USA Basketball following an embarrassing showing at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. The national team took the bronze medal at the 2006 world championship in Japan, then won the gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 world championship.
Should McMillan and D'Antoni remain on the staff, some potentially interesting situations could develop. Two Knicks, Carmelo Anthony and Tyson Chandler, are on the 20-man roster listed on USA Basketball's Web site.
Anthony, with whom D'Antoni feuded in their time together in New York, seems assured of making the team; he was fourth in scoring on the 2008 gold medal team.
Chandler was a member of the gold medal-winning 2010 world championship team in Turkey the summer before he played his one N.B.A. season in Dallas. Portland's LaMarcus Aldridge is also on the 20-man roster. He has yet to play for the senior national team in international competition.
The Americans will hold their Olympic training camp July 6 to 11 at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That will be followed by a July 12 exhibition in Las Vegas against the Dominican Republic, whose coach last year was Kentucky's John Calipari. The United States team will also train in Washington from July 12 to 15, with a game against Brazil; in Manchester, England, from July 17 to 19, with a game against Britain; and in Barcelona, Spain, from July 20 to 25 with a game against Spain.
The Olympic Games run from July 27 to Aug. 12.

HEADLINE: Budget Madness

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Lies, damned lies, and misread statistics. 

 BODY:
I think I need a shower. Talking Points sends us to a badly written article in The Hill about the CBO's latest budget estimates. If you read the article very, very carefully, you might be able to figure out that the CBO only shows Obama increasing deficits relative to a very unrealistic baseline, which among other things assumes that all the Bush tax cuts expire; relative to CBO's "alternative" scenario, which represents a continuation of current policy, Obama actually cuts deficits substantially. But a casual read -- and the headline -- would leave you with the impression of Obama the wild spender.
And hence my need for a shower. Just read the comments, and weep for America.
But here's the thing: it's not just bad reporting spreading this disinformation. Let me come back to John Taylor's appalling op-ed from a year ago, alleging a huge expansion of government that anyone who knows anything about the federal budget knows just didn't happen -- it was all a lower denominator because of the slump, plus unemployment insurance and food stamps. Then, when challenged, rather than acknowledging the error, he tried to use spending projections for a decade from now to claim that there really was a spending binge, forgetting about the baby boomers.
What the CBO report actually says is that it expects deficits to be a bit smaller than Obama projects. Oh, and about spending: here's the OMB projection of spending with and without Social Security and Medicare -- both driven by demography -- and interest costs:
No binge here -- but even GOP "experts" won't admit it.
On a related note, people who can't read numbers making dumb claims about Obamacare.

HEADLINE: Twelve More Partners Leave Dewey Law Firm

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Dewey &#038; LeBoeuf has lost 31 of its 300 partners since January, including the 12 who left Friday. The firm has gotten into financial difficulties after extending rich pay guarantees to its top producers. 

 BODY:
Twelve partners at Dewey & LeBoeuf resigned late Friday, the latest in a wave of departures for the beleaguered law firm.
The lawyers, who are leaving to join Willkie Farr & Gallagher, represent insurance companies in a variety of matters, from mergers and acquisitions to stock and bond offerings. Insurance law is a practice area for which Dewey is well known.
New York-based Dewey has lost 31 of its 300 partners since January, including the 12 who left on Friday. The firm has gotten into financial difficulties after extending lucrative pay guarantees to its top producers. Many partners have had their compensation deferred or slashed after Dewey posted tepid financial results last year.
The firm's problems come at a challenging time for the legal industry, which has yet to recover from the steep economic downturn. And the cost of top legal talent has risen, with many large firms extending multimillion-dollar, multiyear guarantees to their biggest producers.
Dewey is the product of a boom-era merger between two old-line New York law firms. In late 2007, Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene & MacRae combined to fuel growth and expand internationally. As part of its growth strategy, the firm also poached star lawyers away from rivals with rich pay packages.
Alexander M. Dye, Michael Groll and John M. Schwolsky lead the group of insurance partners leaving for Willkie. Mr. Dye heads Dewey's mergers-and-acquisitions practice; Mr. Schwolsky is the co-chairman of the corporate finance group; and Mr. Groll is the co-chairman of the insurance-industry practice.
"We have worked closely with this team in a number of transactions over the years," Thomas M. Cerabino, the co-chairman of Willkie Farr, said in a statement Saturday. "They are among the most elite practitioners in their field and will add greatly to our capabilities in their areas of expertise."
In a firmwide memo sent out late Friday that was obtained by The New York Times, Dewey's chairman, Steven H. Davis, expressed regret over the departures. But he emphasized that they would have an immaterial effect on the firm's profitability.
"We are disappointed to see these partners leave the firm - they have been long-term colleagues and successful practitioners in the insurance sector for many years," Mr. Davis said. "I recognize the emotional impact that these departures will have on our partnership and colleagues."
"However, our initial assessment of these departures is that they will not have an adverse financial impact on the firm," he added.
Mr. Davis said that he expected the firm to lose about $22 million in revenues this year as a result of the group's move. But the moves will also free up expenses of about $21 million - the departing partners were expected to earn about $15 million this year, plus an additional $6 million for junior lawyers and staff members connected to the group.
The memo sought to assuage the lawyers at Dewey, which has about 1,100 lawyers across 25 offices globally.
"I ask that you reassure your teams and colleagues that we, as a partnership, are committed to meeting and overcoming the challenges we face," Mr. Davis said. "We have over 30 practice areas with many talented and highly regarded partners and attorneys and a great staff. It is up to us to assure the firm's success for ourselves, our colleagues and our clients."

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Liability to Asset

BYLINE: EMMARIE HUETTEMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The principles that hurt Rick Santorum in 2006 are helping him in 2012, and studies show gas prices may not matter much to Americans in the voting booth. 

 BODY:
Today's Times:

        
The passionate and polarizing issues that cost Rick Santorum re-election as a Pennsylvania senator in 2006 have helped to rebrand him as the national face of conservatism in 2012. Katharine Q. Seelye reports on Mr. Santorum's principles and their transformation from liabilities to assets.

        
Voters may be upset about rising gas prices, but that doesn't mean they will vent their frustrations at the ballot box. Studies show arguments about the economic and political influence of gas prices are probably overblown, Binyamin Appelbaum reports.

        
Though House freshmen have been portrayed as defiant, an analysis of voting patterns shows House members of the Republican Study Committee - which has veteran and freshmen members alike - have cast the most "no" votes on big bills, Jennifer Steinhauer reports.

        
It is becoming more difficult for President Obama to maintain in the face of criticism that he spends most of his time on official duties as campaign events increasingly crowd his schedule, Mark Landler writes.

        
Due to a quirk in election law, Missouri votersget to vote for a second time in the Republican nominating contest on Saturday after giving a boost to Mr. Santorum's candidacy in February, Jeff Zeleny reports.
Weekly Address:

        
With Republicans leveraging rising gas prices against him, Mr. Obama talked up his administration's efforts to reduce energy costs in his weekly address and called out Congress for wanting to stand in the way. He urged Americans to reach out to their representatives as Congress heads toward a vote on ending subsidies for oil companies and emphasized that there is no simple remedy for pain at the pump. "Anyone who tells you otherwise - any career politician who promises some three-point plan for two-dollar gas - they're not looking for a solution," Mr. Obama said. "They're just looking for your vote."

HEADLINE: Back to Missouri, in Search of a Second Victory

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Voters in Missouri chose Rick Santorum in a nonbinding primary February, and how he wants them to make it official. 

 BODY:
HAZELWOOD, Mo. -- Rick Santorum dashed from caucus to caucus in affluent neighborhoods of suburban St. Louis on Saturday morning, frantically wooing voters in an effort to secure a dominating victory in the Missouri caucuses. The goal was to keep alive momentum from this week's victories in Alabama and Mississippi as he goes in to Tuesday's hard-fought primary in Illinois.
Mr. Santorum won Missouri's nonbonding primary on Feb. 7 with a 55 percent showing that helped revive his candidacy and that anointed him, in the view of many in the Republican Party, as the principal conservative alternative to Mitt Romney.
In four quick stops in this state Saturday before departing for more campaigning in Illinois in the afternoon, he urged supporters to turn out in similar strength again to win him delegates for the national Republican convention.
"You folks spoke loudly and clearly that you want a conservative in this race," Mr. Santorum said at a library here, wearing a green carnation on his blue blazer for St. Patrick's Day. "I would not be standing here today at these caucuses had the people of Missouri not spoken so loudly at your primary."
He likened the race this year to the 1980 election, arguing that problems with Iran, a struggling economy and an ineffective Democratic incumbent called for the same sort of change.
He stuck to familiar attacks against Mr. Romney, suggesting that Mr. Romney would be a weak challenger to President Obama because he will not have the same sort of dominating financial advantage against him that he has enjoyed against opponents in the Republican primary.
And he renewed his attack on Mr. Obama's health care law -- and implicitly on Mr. Romney's health care record -- by calling the repeal of "Obamacare" the most critical issue in the election and arguing that Mr. Romney could not legitimately attack the law because it is so similar to legislation he pursued as governor of Massachusetts.
"We want to make sure we don't give away the most important issue in this election," Mr. Santorum said. "Why, why, why, in this most important issue, in the most important race, about the most important virtue of America, which is freedom, would the Republican party nominate someone who's uniquely disqualified to make the case against President Obama? That's why your votes here today are so important."

HEADLINE: Forget the Money, Follow the Sacredness

BYLINE: JONATHAN HAIDT


HIGHLIGHT: We evolved to be tribal, and politics is a competition among coalitions of tribes. 

 BODY:
In the film version of "All the President's Men," when Robert Redford, playing the journalist Bob Woodward, is struggling to unravel the Watergate conspiracy, an anonymous source advises him to "follow the money." It's a good rule of thumb for understanding the behavior of politicians. But following the money leads you astray if you're trying to understand voters.
Self-interest, political scientists have found, is a surprisingly weak predictor of people's views on specific issues. Parents of children in public school are not more supportive of government aid to schools than other citizens. People without health insurance are not more likely to favor government-provided health insurance than are people who are fully insured.
Despite what you might have learned in Economics 101, people aren't always selfish. In politics, they're more often groupish. When people feel that a group they value - be it racial, religious, regional or ideological - is under attack, they rally to its defense, even at some cost to themselves. We evolved to be tribal, and politics is a competition among coalitions of tribes.
The key to understanding tribal behavior is not money, it's sacredness. The great trick that humans developed at some point in the last few hundred thousand years is the ability to circle around a tree, rock, ancestor, flag, book or god, and then treat that thing as sacred. People who worship the same idol can trust one another, work as a team and prevail over less cohesive groups. So if you want to understand politics, and especially our divisive culture wars, you must follow the sacredness.
A good way to follow the sacredness is to listen to the stories that each tribe tells about itself and the larger nation. The Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith once summarized the moral narrative told by the American left like this: "Once upon a time, the vast majority" of people suffered in societies that were "unjust, unhealthy, repressive and oppressive." These societies were "reprehensible because of their deep-rooted inequality, exploitation and irrational traditionalism - all of which made life very unfair, unpleasant and short. But the noble human aspiration for autonomy, equality and prosperity struggled mightily against the forces of misery and oppression and eventually succeeded in establishing modern, liberal, democratic, capitalist, welfare societies." Despite our progress, "there is much work to be done to dismantle the powerful vestiges of inequality, exploitation and repression." This struggle, as Smith put it, "is the one mission truly worth dedicating one's life to achieving."
This is a heroic liberation narrative. For the American left, African-Americans, women and other victimized groups are the sacred objects at the center of the story. As liberals circle around these groups, they bond together and gain a sense of righteous common purpose.
Contrast that narrative with one that Ronald Reagan developed in the 1970s and '80s for conservatism. The clinical psychologist Drew Westen summarized the Reagan narrative like this: "Once upon a time, America was a shining beacon. Then liberals came along and erected an enormous federal bureaucracy that handcuffed the invisible hand of the free market. They subverted our traditional American values and opposed God and faith at every step of the way." For example, "instead of requiring that people work for a living, they siphoned money from hard-working Americans and gave it to Cadillac-driving drug addicts and welfare queens." Instead of the "traditional American values of family, fidelity and personal responsibility, they preached promiscuity, premarital sex and the gay lifestyle" and instead of "projecting strength to those who would do evil around the world, they cut military budgets, disrespected our soldiers in uniform and burned our flag." In response, "Americans decided to take their country back from those who sought to undermine it."
This, too, is a heroic narrative, but it's a heroism of defense. In this narrative it's God and country that are sacred - hence the importance in conservative iconography of the Bible, the flag, the military and the founding fathers. But the subtext in this narrative is about moral order. For social conservatives, religion and the traditional family are so important in part because they foster self-control, create moral order and fend off chaos. (Think of Rick Santorum's comment that birth control is bad because it's "a license to do things in the sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be.") Liberals are the devil in this narrative because they want to destroy or subvert all sources of moral order.
Actually, there's a second subtext in the Reagan narrative in which liberty is the sacred object. Circling around liberty would seem, on its face, to be more consistent with liberalism and its many liberation movements than with social conservatism. But here's where narrative analysis really helps. Part of Reagan's political genius was that he told a single story about America that rallied libertarians and social conservatives, who are otherwise strange bedfellows. He did this by presenting liberal activist government as the single devil that is eternally bent on destroying two different sets of sacred values - economic liberty and moral order. Only if all nonliberals unite into a coalition of tribes can this devil be defeated.
If you follow the sacredness, you can understand some of the weirdness of the last few months in politics. In January, the Obama administration announced that religiously affiliated hospitals and other institutions must offer health plans that provide free contraception to their members. It's one thing for the government to insist that people have a right to buy a product that their employer abhors. But it's a rather direct act of sacrilege (for many Christians) for the government to force religious institutions to pay for that product. The outraged reaction galvanized the Christian right and gave a lift to Rick Santorum's campaign.
AROUND this time, bills were making their way through state legislatures requiring that women undergo a medically unnecessary ultrasound before they can have an abortion. It's one thing for a state government to make abortions harder to get (as with a waiting period). But it's a rather direct act of sacrilege (for nearly all liberals as well as libertarians) for a state to force a doctor to insert a probe into a woman's vagina. The outraged reaction galvanized the secular left and gave a lift to President Obama.
This is why we've seen the sudden re-emergence of the older culture war - the one between the religious right and the secular left that raged for so many years before the financial crisis and the rise of the Tea Party. When sacred objects are threatened, we can expect a ferocious tribal response. The right perceives a "war on Christianity" and gears up for a holy war. The left perceives a "war on women" and gears up for, well, a holy war.
The timing could hardly be worse. America faces multiple threats and challenges, many of which will require each side to accept a "grand bargain" that imposes, at the very least, painful compromises on core economic values. But when your opponent is the devil, bargaining and compromise are themselves forms of sacrilege.

HEADLINE: In Need of a Game Change, Santorum Plays Small Ball

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum is trying to use his resources to limit Mitt Romney's advantage in the delegate count. The problem with that strategy is that it is almost certain to be a losing one. 

 BODY:
What was Rick Santorum doing in Puerto Rico this week?
Mr. Santorum sparked a controversy by saying the commonwealth would need to adopt English as its primary language before achieving statehood. And a tourist snapped a photo of Mr. Santorum lounging around with his shirt off.
But what was he doing there to begin with?
Mr. Santorum isn't very likely to win Puerto Rico's primary on Sunday - not when Mr. Romney has the endorsement of Gov. Luis G. Fortuo; he also performed much better than Mr. Santorum among Hispanics with Puerto Rican ancestry in Florida. In fact, although there have been no polls of Puerto Rico, the odds are that Mr. Santorum won't come all that close to Mr. Romney.
Ah, but there are delegates at stake. If Mr. Romney wins 50 percent of the vote there, Puerto Rico's 20 bound delegates will be awarded winner-take-all to him, according to the state's rules. If Mr. Romney is held under 50 percent, however, they will be split proportionately among the candidates who get at least 15 percent of the vote.
Perhaps Mr. Santorum's campaign perceives that Mr. Romney is close to the 50 percent threshold. If so, spending some time in Puerto Rico could prevent Mr. Romney from hitting that mark, perhaps limiting him to 9 or 10 delegates rather than 20. 
It's a "small ball" strategy, in other words - one focused on the delegate math. Mr. Santorum is seeking to spend his resources efficiently to limit Mr. Romney's advantage in that department.
This kind of strategy, however, misses the forest for the trees. The problem with it is simple: it is almost certain to be a losing one.
Of the 928 delegates allotted to date in The Associated Press count, Mr. Romney has 495, or 53 percent, while Mr. Santorum has 252, or 27 percent. That isn't all that close.
Moreover, if the remaining primaries and caucuses go anything like the previous ones did, Mr. Romney should continue to obtain delegates at about that pace, according to the detailed projections put together by me and by other analysts. That would put him on pace to clinch the Republican nomination after Utah votes on June 26 or after California and several large states do on June 5.
To be sure, there is some uncertainty in these projections. Newt Gingrich could drop out (which would help Mr. Santorum, but not all that much. Some of the remaining states have not received much polling. And the candidates are going to have their stronger nights and their weaker ones.
But Mr. Romney has some slack: if he is reasonably close to a majority (and no other candidate is), super delegates and other unpledged delegates will put him over the top.
If Mr. Santorum were a little closer to Mr. Romney (say that he had qualified for the ballot in Virginia and won the state) and the allocation rules in the remaining states were a little more favorable to him (say that Texas was winner-take-all rather than proportional), perhaps the small-ball strategy would be worth pursing.
But he is far enough behind that he instead needs a "game change" - something that fundamentally alters the dynamics of the race and allows him to substantially improve on his benchmarks from previous states.
Game-changing events are not easy to come by, of course. But Mr. Santorum's campaign does not seem so interested in maximizing his chance at achieving one. His travel schedule is one such example: Mr. Santorum spent part of last week in Puerto Rico, and will be spending part of Sunday in Louisiana, rather than focusing on Illinois, a state where polls and demographics give Mr. Romney an edge but only a modest one.
A win in Illinois would do much more than anything that might happen in Puerto Rico or Louisiana to alter the momentum in the race. At a bare minimum, it would position Mr. Santorum better for Wisconsin, which votes on April 3 and has 42 delegates - twice as many as Puerto Rico - and awards them on a largely winner-take-all basis.
Or, consider the acquiescent attitude that Mr. Santorum's campaign has taken toward Mr. Romney's dropping out of debates and refusing to schedule any more. Rather than hammering his opponent for his unwillingness to confront the voters, Mr. Santorum followed Mr. Romney's lead in withdrawing from an Oregon debate that was to take place next week.
Perhaps Mr. Santorum thinks that Mr. Romney is a stronger debater, but the debates have been hit-and-miss for all the candidates and have often shaken up the polls in one direction or another.
That kind of high-volatility outcome is exactly what a losing candidate should be pursuing, just as a team that trails late in a basketball game is correct to start trying to shoot more 3-pointers.
For Mr. Santorum to have a shot at winning the nomination, he will need to poll at least 5 or 10 points better across the board than he has so far - and to do so consistently enough that those polls translate into votes and then delegates.
But polls usually do not shift without a reason. They change on the basis of news, and Mr. Santorum's campaign has had trouble driving any of it.
In fact, the political world's attention has begun to drift away from the Republican nomination fight.
The Web site Memeorandum tracks the political stories that are receiving the most attention each day, using a mostly automated process that looks at things like how many bloggers are writing about a subject and how many news outlets are linking to a story. It thus provides for a relatively objective and organic look at what is leading the news coverage.
I went through Memeorandum's archive and tracked the lead story at noon each day dating back to Nov. 22 (the Tuesday before Thanksgiving). In the graphic below, I've marked every time the lead story was about the nomination campaign with a yellow stripe, and every time that it was about some other subject (such as a foreign policy development, an economic report or the general election campaign) with a black one.
The nomination campaign received wall-to-wall coverage from December through February. During this period, only a very dramatic event - like the death of a major world figure or a major showdown in Congress - was enough to supersede it.
In March, however, the nomination campaign has been the lead story just two times in 17 days.
Although there have been one or two major news stories during this period, for the most part the campaign hasn't had all that much to compete with. Even when there has been a campaign story, however, it has quickly fallen from the headlines.
By noon last Wednesday, for instance, the day just after Mr. Santorum's wins in Alabama and Mississippi, coverage of those victories was demoted in Memeorandum's ranking behind an editorial written by Greg Smith, a former Goldman Sachs banker. The editorial had little objective news value - Mr. Smith was not ranked especially high at Goldman Sachs, nor did he reveal any proprietary information about the company. But that story, and not the campaign, is what bloggers and readers were most interested in talking about.
A bit of fatigue about the nomination campaign is understandable, but is also a bearish sign for Mr. Santroum since it implies that voters have begun to settle for the status quo - one in which Mr. Romney has a solid lead and very probably will win.
Although no candidate can completely control the news cycle, campaigns differ in their skill in putting their thumb on the scale and nudging things along. Dropping a piece of opposition research, unveiling a controversial commercial or making a deliberately provocative statement in an interview are all strategies that can shift the substance of the coverage.
Mr. Santorum's campaign, however, has been content to let the news cycle take its course. In fact, it has played down expectations in states like Illinois, a strategy that is intended to draw the news media's attention away from those contests and reduce the amount of momentum that is staked upon them.
It can be difficult for a campaign to acknowledge when it is losing and adapt its strategy accordingly - especially when news media coverage tends to exaggerate how competitive a race is. A campaign may be in danger of reading only the more favorable headlines and believing its own press clippings.
But sometimes a campaign can have a moment of clarity - as John McCain's did in 2008 when it picked Sarah Palin to be his running mate precisely because it knew that it needed to pursue a high-risk, and potentially high-reward approach.
When the campaign picked Mrs. Palin in August 2008, Senator McCain was perhaps 3 points behind Barack Obama in national surveys (slightly more than that in some crucial swing states). This was before the collapse of Lehman Brothers and other events that made Mr. McCain's path almost impossible; betting markets at the time gave him about a 35 percent chance of winning.
Mr. Santorum's odds of winning his campaign are nowhere near that good; the betting market Intrade, instead, now gives him just a 3 percent chance to win the nomination. His campaign is in more need of a game change than Mr. McCain's ever was, and has even less to lose from high-risk strategies.
There may be some benefit to Mr. Santorum in finishing an honorable second place - he could become Mr. Romney's running mate, for instance, or he could position himself to be one of the front-runners in 2016. His campaign has begun to behave as though it is more interested in those goals than in maximizing its slim chances to actually win the nomination.

HEADLINE: As Owners Pile on the Miles, 200,000 Becomes the New 100,000

BYLINE: By DEXTER FORD

 BODY:
HOW far can a modern car really go? Given the increasing age of vehicles on American roads, we may be on the verge of finding out.
As a stubborn recession made drivers wary of new purchases for several years, the average age of vehicles on the road in the United States stretched to a record 11.1 years in 2011, according to the research firm R. L. Polk, which tracks vehicle sales and registrations.
Multiply that number of years by the annual miles driven -- the E.P.A. uses 15,000 for the cost calculation on fuel economy labels -- and it becomes evident that one pearl of conventional wisdom has become outdated.
In the 1960s and '70s, when odometers typically registered no more than 99,999 miles before returning to all zeros, the idea of keeping a car for more than 100,000 miles was the automotive equivalent of driving on thin ice. You could try it, but you'd better be prepared to swim. 
But today, as more owners drive their vehicles farther, some are learning that the imagined limits of vehicular endurance may not be real limits at all. Several factors have aligned to make pushing a car farther much more realistic.
Cars that have survived for a million miles or more have been widely documented, of course, but those tend to be exceptional cases. What's different, and far more common, today are the online classified ads offering secondhand Hondas, Toyotas and Volvos with 150,000 or 200,000 miles -- or more -- not as parts donors but as vehicles with some useful life left.
One driver who has firsthand experience with this new paradigm of durability is Mark Webber, a 57-year-old Porsche salesman.
Mr. Webber has a full grasp of powerful new sports cars -- in January he was in Southern California for sales training and track time with the 2013 Porsche 911 -- but for his 35-mile commute to Herb Chambers Porsche in Boston, from Scituate, Mass., he drives a 1990 Volvo 740 with over 300,000 miles.
''I just can't see the point of spending a lot of money driving a newer, racier car every day in city traffic when my old Volvo just wants to keep on going,'' Mr. Webber said. ''I guess you could say I'm just a New England tightwad.''
In Mr. Webber's case, the enabler of his thrift may be global competition -- and the Environmental Protection Agency.
Customer satisfaction surveys show cars having fewer and fewer problems with each passing year. Much of this improvement is a result of intense global competition -- a carmaker simply can't allow its products to leak oil, break down or wear out prematurely.
But another, less obvious factor has been the government-mandated push for lower emissions.
''The California Air Resources Board and the E.P.A. have been very focused on making sure that catalytic converters perform within 96 percent of their original capability at 100,000 miles,'' said Jagadish Sorab, technical leader for engine design at Ford Motor. ''Because of this, we needed to reduce the amount of oil being used by the engine to reduce the oil reaching the catalysts.
''Fifteen years ago, piston rings would show perhaps 50 microns of wear over the useful life of a vehicle,'' Mr. Sorab said, referring to the engine part responsible for sealing combustion in the cylinder. ''Today, it is less than 10 microns. As a benchmark, a human hair is 200 microns thick.
''Materials are much better,'' Mr. Sorab continued. ''We can use very durable, diamondlike carbon finishes to prevent wear. We have tested our newest breed of EcoBoost engines, in our F-150 pickup, for 250,000 miles. When we tear the engines down, we cannot see any evidence of wear.''
Dr. George Akerlof, who shared the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in economic science with Michael Spence and Joseph Stiglitz, may have predicted this trend of owners keeping cars longer.
In his 1970 paper, ''The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism,'' he noted that the prospective buyer of a used car knows far less about that car than its seller, a phenomenon he called asymmetrical information.
He reasoned that a buyer must assume that any used car is a lemon, because he has no way of knowing for sure whether that car has been abused or crashed. So a buyer, on average, is only willing to pay a below-average price. But the owner of a good used car knows that it is reliable, that he has driven it carefully, changed the oil regularly and maintained the car well.
If the owner of that good used car is not offered what he thinks it is worth, he won't sell it, Dr. Akerlof reasoned. The overall quality of used cars goes down, because only below-average cars are offered, which drives down the value of used cars as a whole. The market is, in economics terms, broken, because the best cars in it are undervalued and are seldom offered for sale.
Because new car sales and leases dropped during the downturn, there are fewer of those to go around. So used-car prices have been rising over the last few years as recession-shy -- and economics-savvy -- drivers have pushed their cars ever farther.
With the value of some older cars actually rising, many drivers decided to drive their current car until it wore out. And because of the improving overall quality of today's automobiles, many are discovering that it is entirely possible for a driver to wear out long before his or her automobile.
J. D. Power customer surveys of problems with new and three-year-old cars have shown, over the years, that cars are simply getting better. And that many of the problems that do surface involve new electronic gadgets like navigation, audio and phone systems that new owners may have a hard time understanding.
The trend toward better, longer-lasting cars seems to have begun way back in the '60s, when the first imports from Asia started to encroach on American and European carmakers' sales figures.
Another factor is that cars from the '60s and '70s were susceptible to rust and corrosion -- many literally fell apart before their engines and transmission wore out. But advances in corrosion protection, some propelled by government requirements for anticorrosion warranties, have greatly reduced that problem.
''Competition is part of it,'' said Peter Egan, a former auto mechanic and now editor at large of Road & Track magazine. ''Japanese cars kind of upped everyone's game a bit. With some exceptions, the engines would go a long time without burning oil or having other major problems.''
Hyundai and Kia, the South Korean carmakers, now include 100,000-mile/10-year warranties on their cars' powertrains. If a relatively abusive driver can count on no major mechanical failures before 100,000 miles, a careful owner can -- and does -- expect his car to go much farther.
''With a '66 Chevy Impala, you could rebuild everything on the car with a reasonable level of mechanical skill,'' said Mr. Egan of Road & Track. ''My parents, with their '56 Buick, used to have the wheel bearings repacked with grease before a long trip. Nobody does that anymore. The lubricants are better, the machining is better.''
Some drivers, of course, keep driving their cars simply because they love them.
Edmund Willcox Clarke Jr., a Superior Court Judge of Los Angeles County, has driven his 1989 Porsche 911 Carrera for over 300,000 miles.
''It was my first brand-new car,'' he said. ''It was designed the way I wanted it, and looked and drove exactly as I wanted it. I loved it from the beginning, and I'm still fond of it.''
But Judge Clarke has lavished plenty of attention on his Porsche.
''I rebuilt the engine a couple of times, because of wear and tear and to keep the performance up,'' he said. ''I had it painted a couple of times to keep it looking stylish. My body fit into that seat and the car felt like an extension of me. I could tell when it was tired.
''I think the car was well made -- that was one reason it lasted so long,'' he said. ''I stayed ahead of it. As long as it was reliable and loyal to me, I was loyal to it.''
Judge Clarke finally bought a new car last year, an electric Tesla Roadster that he can drive in the carpool lane on the clogged Harbor Freeway every weekday. But his 1989 Porsche still sits in his Manhattan Beach, Calif., driveway, carefully covered, as if waiting for its owner to return.

HEADLINE: Building the American Dream in China

BYLINE: By BROOK LARMER

 BODY:
Daniel Gillen is afraid of heights. The young American architect didn't think to tell me this until we had already climbed up a construction ladder and started walking gingerly across the curved roof of an unfinished building in northeastern China.
It was a frigid day in late February, with temperatures dropping to 15 degrees below zero, and the roof's undulating steel surface made it feel as if we were surfing on a frozen ocean wave -- one that, at this height, promised a very hard landing.
''We'd never get away with this in the U.S.,'' Gillen said with a nervous laugh. 
From the roof, Gillen and I gazed out at a vast new city that didn't exist two years ago. Row after row of 20-story apartment towers radiated out in every direction, in regimented monotony as far as we could see. There were hundreds of towers, almost all of them empty. ''When I first came here two years ago, this area was just a bunch of fields covered with construction cranes,'' said Gillen, who is 32. Now the farmlands outside Harbin have been transformed into one of the dozens of insta-cities rising around China. ''Standing here,'' Gillen said, ''you just have to be in awe of what China can accomplish.''
The building beneath Gillen's black leather boots inspired a different sort of wonder. A whimsical, torquing 660-foot-long tube sheathed in stainless steel, the Harbin Wood Sculpture Museum is the architectural fantasy of Gillen's boss, Ma Yansong, and his team at MAD Architects in Beijing. The building's design evokes the natural world -- an iceberg, say, or a piece of driftwood -- but given its backdrop, I couldn't help thinking that it looked like a shimmering spaceship that had touched down unexpectedly in an alien urban landscape.
In that respect, it is not so different from Gillen himself, whose shaved head, muscular build and thick silver thumb ring make him something of an oddity in this city on China's northern frontier. When Gillen was laid off in December 2008 by Asymptote Architecture, a New York firm, he hunkered down in his Brooklyn apartment, trying to stave off the ''vibe of hopelessness.'' Six months passed. His profession had been flattened by the financial crisis that put an abrupt halt to new construction. Gillen sent out dozens of resumes, but no offers came. Then, in early summer, he spotted a job posting for MAD Architects on a design Web site. The firm's acronym seemed to sum up the outlandish proposition. ''China was not on my radar at all,'' he told me. The starting salary at MAD was half of what he earned in New York. Desperate, Gillen jumped.
Up on the museum's sloping steel roof, his fear under control, Gillen marveled at his good fortune. ''This kind of project,'' he said, ''could not be built anywhere else in the world today.'' Nor could Gillen have found such an opportunity if he hadn't journeyed 6,000 miles from home.
Over the past three years, foreign architects and designers have poured into China, fleeing economic crises at home and pinning their hopes on this country's explosive growth. It is, after all, a place that McKinsey & Company predicts will build 50,000 skyscrapers in the next two decades, the equivalent of 10 New Yorks. MAD's staff consisted almost entirely of mainland Chinese when Gillen arrived in mid-2009; today, nearly half of his 50 colleagues are foreigners, with designers from Holland, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Colombia, Japan and Thailand. ''The economic crisis,'' Gillen says, ''is a heavy factor in everybody's thought process.''
This is the expected global economic formula flipped on its head: instead of American workers losing out to the Chinese, China is providing jobs for foreign architects. Even more surprising is the degree of imaginative license that China offers, even demands of, its foreign building designers. With new cities materializing seemingly overnight, international architects are free to think big, to experiment with cutting-edge designs, to introduce green technologies. All at a frantic pace. In a top-down system that favors political will and connections over regulatory oversight and public debate, large-scale projects in China can be designed, built and put to use in the space of just a few years.
China, of course, is not new terrain for international architects. Many top American firms have run offices inside China for a decade or more. Nearly all of the country's iconic modern buildings have been designed by foreigners, from the National Stadium, known as the Bird's Nest, (by the Swiss firm Herzog and de Meuron) and the gravity-defying China Central Television Tower (by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas) to the 128-story Shanghai Tower (by San Francisco's Gensler), which will be the second-tallest building in the world when it's completed in 2014. The new arrivals, though, come not by invitation or out of curiosity but because they need work. They are, as Michael Tunkey, head of the China office for the North American firm Cannon Design, says, ''refugees from the economic crisis.''
The scale and speed of China's expansion is like nothing these architects experienced in their home countries. Fueled by rising prosperity and the largest rural-to-urban shift in history -- some 300 million Chinese became city dwellers over the past two decades -- the boom has utterly transformed the eastern seaboard around Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The fastest growth now is taking place deep in the country's interior or on its outer edges in cities little known in the West: Harbin, Changsha, Chengdu and dozens of others. ''It's still shocking to me,'' says Manuel Sanchez-Vera, a 43-year-old architect who shuttered his own Madrid practice two years ago and joined a midsize Australian firm in Shanghai. ''I just got out of a meeting to design a hospital for a city that will grow from 4 million to 10 million in the next few years. How do you design for an explosion like that?''
The answer to that question, in the main, is quickly and cheaply. While some marquee projects -- like the Harbin museum Gillen is working on -- attract a lot of attention, most foreign architects in China are designing office towers, housing developments, hospitals and shopping malls, projects in which creativity is in constant tension with the bottom line. Despite the excitement over the flow of projects -- indeed, the mere existence of work -- there is also a deeper concern: all those empty apartment buildings in Harbin and elsewhere suggest that China's building boom may have passed its peak.
For now, though, Gillen sees no better alternative. ''I'm an architect, I like to build,'' he says. ''And China is a place where things get built.''
In December 2008, right around the time Gillen joined the ranks of the unemployed in Brooklyn, another young American architect lost his job in San Francisco. Adam Mayer, then 26, received his pink slip one year after joining Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.
The rejection stung. Mayer, a glib and gregarious University of Southern California graduate, had long aspired to work at SOM -- a blue-chip firm whose San Francisco office was not far from his family's home in Silicon Valley. Unlike Gillen, though, Mayer saw no point in sending out resumes or nursing the hope of an economic recovery. ''I didn't even bother looking for a job,'' he told me. ''All my U.S.C. friends were hitting a brick wall, and the only projects on SOM's drawing boards seemed to be in China. So I just bought a ticket to Beijing. I had nothing to lose.''
Mayer spoke no Mandarin. And, like many designers, he had not yet passed the arduous set of exams needed to obtain an architect's license in the states. ''Legally, in the U.S., I can't call myself an architect,'' Mayer said. ''But in China, it doesn't matter.''
Four months after arriving in Beijing, Mayer landed a full-time position at a large Singaporean firm with offices around China. The one catch: Mayer had to move to Chengdu, the capital of southwestern Sichuan Province and the front line of the Chinese government's Develop the West campaign. About 300 Chinese staff members filled the large open space of the company's Chengdu office. Only a handful, mostly Chinese with overseas passports, spoke English. Besides Mayer, there was just one other Westerner, a young Argentine designer.
During his year at SOM in San Francisco, Mayer worked primarily on one building, and his role was subordinate. But his bosses in Chengdu were asking him to prepare conceptual designs for a series of huge projects: a 1.5-million-square-foot redevelopment zone in central Chengdu, a vast new residential area for China's biggest housing developer, even a new headquarters for Chengdu's urban-planning bureau. ''I had a ton of creative freedom,'' Mayer says. ''If you ask architects coming out of grad school, they all say they want to be conceptual designers. So it was great at first.''
The pace was relentless. From designing one or two projects a month, Mayer was soon being pushed to produce one large-scale conceptual design every week. ''The deadlines were crazy,'' Mayer says. ''Sometimes we'd have three days to finish a 250,000-square-meter project.'' Even so, his Chinese colleagues churned out even more. ''In terms of pure production, the local staff could work faster and more efficiently than anything I've ever seen in the U.S.,'' Mayer says, even if in some instances they saw no shame in ''literally copying designs right out of a book.''
Creativity was supposed to be Mayer's job. Like most foreign architects in China, he was hired with the expectation that he would give designs an innovative edge -- along with the prestige that many Chinese still associate with a foreign name. (More than once, Mayer was invited to sit silently at client meetings, even when he knew nothing about the project under discussion.) Mayer helped create some stunning designs, including a plan for a state-owned publisher's headquarters that drew inspiration from ancient Chinese scrolls. Still, the mantra was always ''Bigger, bolder, flashier.'' During one meeting at the urban-planning bureau, Mayer recalls an official who implored them, ''Make us a landmark that will stand out and make people notice!''
The question of whether China can innovate looms over the country's quest to move beyond its role as the world's factory. In architecture, Mayer says, the problem is not simply an education system that stresses technical skills over abstract thinking but also the pressure cooker that compels developers to build as fast and as profitably as possible. For all the lip service given to creativity, he says, too often the results are cookie-cutter developments that make Chinese cities feel depressingly similar -- and surpassingly ugly. ''To come up with something new and creative takes time,'' he says, ''and in China, there's not the luxury of time.''
One morning in February, Gillen showed me around MAD Architects' open-plan studio in Beijing, which occupies the top two floors of a defunct printing plant in a narrow alleyway. Rows of Chinese and foreign architects were working in an almost sepulchral silence, surrounded by models of their fanciful projects: on one end of the second floor, there was a twisting, layered skyscraper designed for Chongqing, on the other a swirly cross section of an opera house and a performing-arts center whose construction Gillen was also overseeing in Harbin.
Occupying the studio's central space, however, was a common Chinese totem: a Ping-Pong table. Not long ago, Gillen, an avid player himself, organized an officewide tournament, with an iPad going to the champion. It wasn't quite Ping-Pong diplomacy, but the event served to bring the local and foreign staff members closer together.
When Gillen made his blind leap into China, he knew very little about MAD except that its founder, the 37-year-old Ma Yansong, was a rising talent. Ma, who trained at Yale and apprenticed with the British architect Zaha Hadid, is celebrated as the first Chinese architect to win a foreign competition: the Absolute Towers in Toronto. He was proof that China was coming into its own as a creative architectural force. (Further evidence came recently when the 2012 Pritzker Prize -- architecture's top honor -- was awarded to another Chinese architect, Wang Shu.)
Ma and Gillen sit a few feet apart, at identical workstations, but the rolls of blueprints that make a sort of miniature skyline on the American's desk show the role he has taken on. Hired as a designer, Gillen now oversees the building of Ma's architectural concoctions. ''I am the executioner,'' he says with a grin. ''I just try to get things done without making either my boss or the client unhappy.''
The client, in the case of the Harbin Wood Sculpture Museum, is the local government, which occupies a glass building with a red Chinese flag next door to the construction site. ''The top-down system can make things very simple,'' Gillen says. ''The leader says, 'I want it; you make it,' and it's done.'' Never mind that the projected ticket sales for the museum's exhibitions, which are anchored by the collected works of a locally renowned wood sculptor, could never match the building's extravagant price tag.
Such an issue might stop a project in the United States. But in China, the primary concerns are prestige and development for its own sake, and the leaders would move heaven -- and lots of earth -- to get the museum built. ''These projects are the Louis Vuitton bags of architecture,'' says one foreign architect, who has worked on several marquee buildings in China. ''Every city in China wants one now.''
With all the excitement over architectural possibilities in China, there is a reluctance to address the obvious question: What happens if the social, cultural and economic environment cannot support these cutting-edge designs after they are built? This is already a problem, both for prestige projects and massive urban developments. MAD, for example, has built the voluptuously curved Ordos Museum in a new planned city in Inner Mongolia. But the real estate bubble popped in Ordos last year. The museum now sits forlornly in an empty development, a symbol of architectural achievement as well as the folly of ambition. ''These are like the Fields of Dreams,'' Gillen says. ''Build it, and they will come.'' Sometimes, though, they don't come.
In Harbin, I met two Chinese men in thick coats wandering around the Wood Sculpture Museum. They were trying to decide if it looked more like a whale or a shimmering serpent. ''It certainly is unusual,'' said one, who identified himself as Mr. Wang and who bought an apartment in one of the high-rises behind the museum two years ago. Did he like the design? ''Well, yes,'' he said, ''because it's already made my property nearly double in value!''
Gillen is not paid to worry about the museum's future or its development value -- just to ensure that it is built. And that often requires handling shifting demands that would be almost unimaginable back home. When the pit for the wood-sculpture museum's foundation had already been dug, for instance, the government made a startling request to double the area to 66,000 square feet. The demand meant drafting a new set of designs and digging the foundation several yards larger to create a new underground gallery space. ''In the U.S., the contract would've been ripped up and renegotiated,'' Gillen said. But MAD complied with the request without complaint. It was another lesson in the Chinese art of making guanxi, or cultivating relationships. Who knows what commissions a cooperative attitude might lead to in the future?
Walking through the museum's cathedral-like interior, with rays of morning sunshine streaming through the skylights, Gillen snapped photos of imperfections: a shattered pane of curved glass, a poorly placed water pipe. He was keenly aware of the shoddy workmanship that has plagued other modern buildings in China. It is one price of excessive speed. ''I want to build a monument that lasts,'' he says. Even so, he couldn't get over the pace of progress. ''This is a complex project, but we've gone from design to nearly finished construction in just two years!'' Gillen said. ''I'm not saying this system is better than ours back home. But sometimes it seems like the U.S. is sitting on the couch sipping coffee while China is Carl Lewis running as hard as it can.''
It was nearly 1 a.m. on a weeknight in Chengdu, but a band was playing at China Groove, and the expatriate architects seemed in no hurry to leave. Clustered around a table on a night in mid-February were newly arrived architects from Germany, New Zealand and Britain, as well as a young Iranian construction supplier just in from Tehran. The music was blasting, and the young men (yes, a large proportion of the foreign architects in China are men) had to yell to make themselves heard.
''Have you seen the world's biggest building yet?'' shouted Stephan Wurster, an affable 38-year-old Stuttgart native who moved here in December after three years in Beijing. Both he and Kamaljot Singh Panesar, a goateed British architect at the table, have offices in development zones mushrooming on the plains south of Chengdu, not far from a half-completed behemoth called Ocean Park. Under a single roof covering an area of about 25 football fields, Ocean Park is designed to include hotels, shopping malls, aquariums, amusement parks and a simulated ocean with a white-sand beach. (The ultimate ''Truman Show'' touch: the 660-foot-wide video screen that will allow beachgoers to enjoy brilliant digital sunsets, even when clouds and pollution block the real thing.)
Wurster takes more than a passing interest in the Chinese-designed building: it stands directly across from the site where he is overseeing construction of a contemporary art center for his bosses at Zaha Hadid Architects. The same Chinese investor behind Ocean Park, in fact, is financing the arts center as a gift to Chengdu. And what city leader wouldn't be flattered to receive a cultural icon designed by a world-famous architect? Still, Hadid's firm has had to make compromises -- overhauling the sinuous design because local officials thought it looked like a snake, which is considered bad luck. ''Even on status projects,'' Wurster said with a laugh, ''there's no carte blanche in China.''
The hidden rules and restrictions are felt even more strongly by the vast majority of foreign architects who are not working on high-visibility projects. Consider Panesar. The financial crisis devastated his boutique firm in London in 2009, forcing him and his partner at Urban Hybrid Architecture to lay off most of their 15-person staff and take a gamble on China. Dapper and soft-spoken, Panesar, who is 35, has spent the past 18 months scrambling to get his foot in the door with all kinds of projects in Chengdu: train stations, kindergartens, residential developments. So far, he has pulled in enough design fees to keep his firm afloat. But he's still waiting for one of the designs to actually be built. ''China is not the blank canvas that you imagine,'' Panesar said. ''We're just crawling really, but we're here for the long haul.''
There was one expat missing that night at China Groove. Adam Mayer, now 29, left his job in Chengdu a few weeks earlier and flew back to California to figure out his next move. ''I built up a great portfolio of designs,'' Mayer told me when we talked by Skype. ''But I started to wonder what good it served.'' None of his designs were built. For all the creative freedom he enjoyed, Mayer began longing for stronger mentoring and more concrete results. In some cases, clients were using his work to impress officials in hopes of winning a bid or acquiring land for a future project. (In China, all land is owned by the state.) ''I feel as though I was more in advertising or marketing than architecture,'' he said.
Mayer's experience is not universal. But many foreign architects in China sense that they are operating in the dark, toiling in a system they dimly understand. Real estate development in China is a murky business. There is little transparency -- and lots of horse trading -- in everything from the acquisition of land to the awarding of bids and competitions. In all but the highest-profile projects, foreigners are largely sidelined during the building process itself, which by law and tradition is controlled by local design institutes.
As foreign architects continue to arrive, there is also increasing competition for jobs and business. Some international firms have even started lowballing bids to try to buy their way into the market -- a development that is ''killing Western firms here,'' says the Shanghai-based Dutch architect Daan Roggeveen, who is the co-author of a book on China's new megacities. In the meantime, Chinese and foreign firms alike are moving to localize their staffs -- both to cut costs and to cultivate a new generation of Chinese architects, many of whom have trained abroad.
''I'll definitely go back to China,'' Mayer said. For now, though, he is too busy cramming for the exams that will allow him, at last, to call himself an architect in the United States.
A few miles from the wood-sculpture museum near Harbin, a far bigger cultural landmark is rising on the banks of the frozen Songhua River. When it is finished, the Harbin Cultural Island -- the MAD-designed opera house and performance center I saw modeled in the office -- will look like a trio of snow-swirled mountains. Gillen was checking on the progress. ''Three years ago,'' he admitted, ''I'd never even heard of Harbin.''
As we clambered to the top of this construction site -- those heights again -- it somehow made sense that Gillen's planned year in China had extended to almost three. In his previous job at a New York firm, he said, ''I spent a year and a half doing concept designs that never got built.'' When I asked him how long his China sojourn might last, he smiled: ''How's the New York real estate market doing?'' As the winter sun hung over the horizon, Gillen walked around the half-completed opera house -- ''a baby being born,'' he called it -- and added: ''I'm in a lucky position. I don't know if the pace of growth in China is sustainable, but I'll ride it as long as I can.''

HEADLINE: Urban Beach Paradise

BYLINE: By CHARLES WILSON

 BODY:
In Far Rockaway, a Queens neighborhood on the slender peninsula east of Coney Island, the beach bungalow is having a surprising revival. What was once thought of as a desolate stretch near the last stop on the A train is now home, at least on weekends, to urban pioneers drawn by quiet beaches, decent surfing and the unlikely chance to own a seaside house in the city. 
The tiny Rockaway bungalows are refugees from another era. They were constructed in waves of speculation beginning in 1905. The low rents allowed regular New Yorkers -- butchers, bookkeepers, clerks -- to have a modest vacation home near the beach. ''Far Rockaway was the working-class Riviera,'' says Barbara Bleier-Schlachet, who spent many summers of her childhood in a rented bungalow.
In the late 1930s, there were more than 7,000 bungalows in the Rockaways. Today, fewer than 700 survive. With the decline of the area's resort community after World War II, the bungalows fell into disrepair. The city moved welfare recipients into them in the off-season, even though few were winterized. ''Rockaway became a dumping ground,'' says Larry Kaplan, co-author of ''Between Ocean and City,'' a history of development in the Rockaways. ''The bungalows became eyesores.'' The city later demolished more than 300 acres of the Rockaways to make way for development and public housing.
In recent years, though, the surviving houses have attracted some passionate defenders who are trying to resurrect the spirit of the bungalow colonies. In a recession-battered economy, bungalows have become a home by the sea for surfers, filmmakers, artists and others who can't afford -- or don't want -- a place in the Hamptons. Residents between Beach 24th and Beach 26th Streets have successfully campaigned to protect their blocks from large-scale development.
''This area was very bad,'' says Carmela George, who bought two bungalows on Beach 25th Street for $25,000 in 1984. ''There was shooting, and drugs, and prostitution, and gang wars, and the bungalows were burning. But I knew they were a good buy. They were on the water. People were stupid not to get in here at that time.''

Cristina Garcia's most recent novels are ''The Lady Matador's Hotel'' and ''Dreams of Significant Girls.''

 BODY:
THE VANISHERS
By Heidi Julavits
284 pp. Doubleday. $26.95.
The darkly comic world of Heidi Julavits's latest novel contains warring psychics, missing people who've deliberately vanished themselves, twisted avant-garde filmmakers, absent mothers, striving academics, plastic surgery enthusiasts, Sylvia Plath obsessives -- and the people who love to hate and pursue all of them. Beneath this hyperactivity, the novel deals, fundamentally, with the ''economics of revenge'' and a daughter's search for her mother. It is told in Julavits's signature style: sharp-eyed, sardonic, hilarious. 
The author of three previous novels (''The Mineral Palace,'' ''The Effect of Living Backwards'' and ''The Uses of Enchantment'') and a founding editor of the literary magazine The Believer, Julavits is at her acrobatically linguistic best here. Nearly every page contains a showstopping description or insight. A Barcelona chair becomes a fully eroticized object -- ''the angle of recline, the shortened legs, the offered-to-the-sky cant of the seat, it was engineered perfectly for someone to give, for someone to receive'' -- while a pair of plastic surgery patients, ''given their gigantic white head-bandages and the underwater slowness with which they moved,'' resemble ''very relaxed astronauts.''
The novel's narrator is Julia Severn, a talented young student at a renowned institute for psychics in New Hampshire, where she is acolyte to the narcissistic Madame Ackermann. Julia is chosen to be her idol's stenographer, a job that entails transcribing the ''regressions'' for which Madame Ackermann has become famous in the occult world. Except that the Queen of Divination's trance states are a huge, yawning bore. In part to spare her teacher the embarrassment of coming up empty, Julia begins to fabricate Madame Ackermann's memories, telling her that ''she'd spoken in the voice of an Argentinian-born psychotherapist living in London during the Falklands war, a woman who'd engaged in amatory adventures with her cabinet patients in order to acquire strategic military information for her brother, a commander of the Argentine Navy.'' And so on.
Madame Ackermann grows suspicious of these increasingly elaborate deceptions but soon discovers discrepancies in one of Julia's tall tales that reveal her student's emerging psychic talents. In a jealous rage, Madame Ackermann -- who eerily resembles Julia's dead mother -- inflicts a near-lethal psychic attack on her hapless stenographer, who then retreats into a pill-popping, zombielike existence in New York City. ''I'm living the dream,'' Julia deadpans to an inquiry regarding her copious ingestion of prescription medications. ''Bewildered girl in her mid-20s moves to the big city . . . and dulls her existential disorientation with drugs.''
Julia's narrative voice is superb. Funny, self-deprecating, exquisitely attuned, she speaks as if the entire acreage of her skin were a listening device. Nothing is lost on her, and she's as unsparing about herself as she is of those around her. This pointed, fragile honesty makes her a winsome heroine, even in the most far-fetched of circumstances. When her father and stepmother, Blanche, visit her out of concern for her health, their awkward interactions provide first-rate drawing-room comedy. Julia's father, a sinkhole specialist who remains emotionally paralyzed over his previous wife's death, ''expressed physical affection like a bad mime. He threw himself at me and administered the Heimlich maneuver of hugs.'' Meanwhile Blanche, a wacky, well-meaning sort, is a voice of easily skewered earnestness.
After months of illness and a dead-end job as a showroom model at a flooring company, where she is made to fake speaking Arabic, Julia is lured -- partly through trickery, partly through a desire for revenge -- into searching for a missing French filmmaker, Dominique Varga. The catalysts for this mission are Alwyn, a morose connoisseur of arty underground pornography films, and Alwyn's partner, an ambitious, thwarted academic (is there any other kind?) named Colophon. They persuade Julia to undergo a psychic rehabilitation in hopes that she'll track down Varga, a blisteringly scathing artist many people might have wanted dead. Julia has her own reasons for joining this Pyrrhic search, having discovered that her birth mother -- who committed suicide when Julia was only a month old -- spent time with Varga shortly before her death.
Julia is thus inducted into the murky world of the ''vanishers,'' where the extremely distraught are helped to disappear in a kind of witness protection program. Their only trace: a vast library of goodbye testimonial films, ''a living mortuary, a hopeful grief museum,'' to which Julia halfheartedly contributes in order to stage her own temporary disappearance.
This, however, is where the story goes awry. As Julia regains her powers, first at a European safe house that doubles as a plastic surgery recovery center, then at another that treats schizophrenics (and is unfortunately named Breganz-Belken), the plots and subplots, double dealings, surgical impersonators, paparazzi, hallucinations, thefts and swaddling of wounds, psychic and otherwise, begin to drag on the novel's momentum.
While the language remains vivid, its satisfactions are overwhelmed by the confusion of the overdetermined plot. In her search, Julia is subjected to traumatizing regressions, a recurring wolf apparition that appears behind her eyelids (Madame Ackermann's psychic signature), cyber-baiting by an unknown stalker, creepy attention from a Hungarian skin-care heiress and real-life discoveries (of an extraordinary cache of Varga photographs, for instance) that contribute, piecemeal, to revelations about her mother's past. Over all, the stakes feel artificially pumped up by the hectic narrative, which labors to deliver forced surprise after forced surprise. Earlier, Julia professes a mistrust of happenstance: ''After a while you can begin to feel stalked by coincidence, or as though you can manipulate the world by expressing a narrative desire -- this thread is loose, this thread inconclusive.'' Regrettably, ''The Vanishers'' becomes a victim of its own dizzying coincidences.
s a result, the novel's more serious concerns -- deliberations on how the past suffuses the present, the ultimate unknowability of another's grief, the painstaking task of constructing history in the absence of witnesses, the weight of emotional inheritances -- are swamped by less interesting minutiae. For many of the characters here, vanishing becomes a way of life, of coping with the unbearable, of transmuting identity into a more manageable, if anonymous, existence. Identity, like so much unwanted history, is a burden to be shed. Underscoring these preoccupations are intermittent allusions to the suicide of Sylvia Plath, which play like a recurring loop of a grainy family movie.
Julia asks herself: Would she prefer to have her mother dead, or to have her alive but unknown to her? ''My answer was ugly and unequivocal. Given the choice, I'd prefer her dead. To kill yourself was to say to your family members, I can no longer live with myself. To vanish was to say, I can no longer live with you.'' Such feelings are compounded by the loss of Madame Ackermann, Julia's dubious mother substitute. But this potentially fascinating terrain gets lost in the hermetic clutter of who is deceiving (or being deceived by) whom.
One of the pleasures of reading novels is the possibility of stopping time and savoring, for a brief eternity, a character's deepest yearnings and illuminations. When Julavits pauses long enough to let us catch our breath, the results are frequently remarkable. Toward the end of the book Julia assumes a kind of emotional kinship with Plath's orphaned children, who must know ''the sad ways that a mother's love can be amplified or reduced to acts both monumentally considerate and monumentally selfish.'' For heartbreaking pleasures like these, I would, despite this novel's flaws, still follow Julavits anywhere.

HEADLINE: The Liu Wen Express

BYLINE: By CHRISTINA LARSON

 BODY:
Slipping into a pair of blue Marc Jacobs pants in the back of a rented van in Yongzhou, China, the model Liu Wen was feeling an unusual degree of jitters. Changing clothes on the go is standard practice for models shooting on location, and she liked the look: ''It's tomboy style,'' she said. ''I feel it's my style.'' And under most circumstances -- long travel, bad weather, unexpected wardrobe glitches -- China's first bona fide supermodel has a reputation in the industry for being gracious and professional. But as the van pulled up to her old middle school, she peered worriedly out the curtained windows at a waiting crowd: hundreds of frantic teenagers in white uniform jackets, spitting images of her recent former self. ''It's getting crazy here,'' she said. The students were chanting, ''Liu Wen, Liu Wen'' and were armed with cellphone cameras and notepads for autographs, eager for the return of their school's most famous alum. ''I'm not that big a celebrity,'' she said. ''I'm just an ordinary person.'' 
At 24, Liu is not so far removed, in years, from her time at Yongzhou No.3 Middle School. She grew up in the southern province of Hunan, most famous as the birthplace of Mao Zedong and as a powerhouse of domestic pork production. Back then in Yongzhou, population 5.7 million, there were ''no fashion stores, not even fashion magazines,'' she said. ''Our sense of the outside world came mainly from South Korean soap operas.'' About the only widely recognized Western brands in town were Kentucky Fried Chicken and McDonald's. Her modest five-story school has long open-air corridors leading to cramped classrooms lined with old-fashioned blackboards. On the walls hang portraits of Chairman Mao, Vladimir Lenin, William Shakespeare, Hu Jintao and other inspirational figures. In winter, to conserve electricity, students and teachers wear coats inside to keep warm.
It was, in other words, hardly fated that a girl from China's pig country would go on to become, as Liu has, the first Asian model to be the global face of Estee Lauder, the first Chinese model to walk the Victoria's Secret runway and one of the most booked Asian runway models in the world. She has learned to wear stilettos (''I never wore high heels in my hometown'') and taught herself English. She moved to Beijing and then to New York City. Perhaps the only thing that remains the same is that she is single. ''I have never had a boyfriend,'' she told me. ''In my school days, everyone thought I'm too tall for a Chinese girl. And now, I travel so much. Maybe in 2012.'' It was her first time home in more than a year, and she was reflective about how her perspective had changed. ''Twenty-four is still young in New York, but in Hunan most of my friends are married.''
For the most part, Liu takes mind-boggling change in stride. Perhaps this quality, more than anything else, defines young Chinese people today. But somehow contemplating it all, compressed into a single instant, felt overwhelming. Yet when she stepped into the shrieking crowd, shaking hands and answering questions, the anxiety wore off. ''I feel like here is home,'' she said. ''It's been a long time, but it still feels very warm.''
In a little room upstairs, Liu had lunch with several of her old teachers, surrounded by laminated posters of beach scenes and palm trees -- exotic places few of her peers have seen. With the heating off, everyone huddled around a circular table in sweaters and dark jackets, save for the principal, Mr. Liu, who wore a gray suit with a purple tie for the occasion. On the table was a plastic dish full of sunflower seeds. The teachers uncorked two bottles of red wine, a treat, and offered rounds of toasts, standing up and clinking glasses in the style of a Chinese banquet. Liu, who does not drink alcohol, raised her cup of green tea and offered a personal motto: ''Be a good student and enjoy your life. You never know the future.''
Certainly Liu's success rides largely on her looks --
''I often use the word 'sharp' to describe her,'' a casting director for Victoria's Secret, John Pfeiffer, told me. ''She's not a soft, delicate beauty. But she has that very indefinable 'It' factor, full of presence.'' That she defies the stereotype of the spoiled, immature mannequin has also helped her. (''After our first meeting, she sent a handwritten thank you card; it was charming,'' Aerin Lauder remembers.)
Yet her rise is due in equal measure to the extraordinary moment in China's history from which she emerged. When Liu was born, in 1988, the daughter of a construction worker, many of the brands she has modeled for -- Dior, Chanel, Jean Paul Gaultier -- were unknown in the country. Beijing was then a sea of bicycles, and thick coal dust in the air darkened both shirt collars and the sky. China's per capita annual income was just $704
(last year it was $5,184), and only a sliver of the population could afford such luxuries as skin creams and handbags.
With roaring economic growth every year of her childhood, Beijing was transformed by the time Liu moved there in 2006, as an 18-year-old aspiring model. No longer a wasteland of sleepy state-owned department stores, the capital was throwing up stadiums, shopping malls and car dealerships. At the same time, the city had become a magnet for China's young dreamers -- artists, writers, designers, punk bands, models.
It was into this energetic new world that Liu stepped one November morning after a 20-hour train ride from Yongzhou. She had come alone, clutching two suitcases full of warm clothes and snack foods her mother had packed. That fall, she had won a modeling contest in Hunan; her victory gave her the idea that modeling might be a career, but in no way assured success. She insisted that she's ''not pretty, pretty, pretty by Chinese standards -- big eyes and small nose and mouth.'' She had come on a leap of faith.
In her first apartment, which she split with two other aspiring models, she began to pile up fashion magazines, at least 2,000 by her own estimate. Many, like Vogue China, had only recently printed their first issue, catering to a new class of urban Chinese consumers whose spending on cosmetics alone has leapt from $24 million in 1982 to $168 billion in 2009.
In 2007, Liu was discovered at a Beijing fitting by Joseph Carle, then a creative director at Marie Claire International looking for models to whom both Western and Chinese women could relate.
Soon she was appearing in those magazines she'd been hoarding, and by 2008 she'd walked for Burberry in Milan. The next year she moved to New York, knowing almost no English. ''I could only smile and say, 'yes' and 'no,' '' she recalled. But she learned quickly with the help of Broadway shows, ''Gossip Girl'' and by comparing Chinese and English versions of the Harry Potter books. And she found a new look in vintage stores, a concept little known in China. Over Skype her mother asked her: ''Why would you buy that old stuff, when you can afford new?''
Back in Hunan province, Liu posed at the ancient Yuelu Academy in Changsha, under a misty gray sky. Taking an optimistic view of the drizzle, she repeated an old Chinese saying: ''Rain brings riches.'' At that moment, a group of Chinese tourists wandered through the impromptu set, trailing a woman with a microphone clipped to her collar: ''Ladies and gentlemen, this way.'' Had she not become a model, she had planned to enter a local vocational school to become just such a tour guide. Now the crowd paid little attention to the tall slender woman wrapped for warmth in a blue parka. Only one young girl stopped and stared. Turning to a friend, she whispered, ''She is so beautiful.'' Liu warmed to the familiar lilt of Hunan dialect.
In the van later, barreling between the Changsha and Yongzhou, she curled up across two seats and caught up on sleep. Outside, the light had faded; the view through the window soon changed from city -- new hotels and high-rises -- to rolling fields where farmers toil with spades in small plots still untouched by modern farm equipment. It felt a little like traveling back in time, although both worlds, the ancient and the hyper-modern, exist in China today. And Liu has learned the art of slipping between them.
At about midnight, the van pulled up to a rest stop near a Sinopec gas station. There were several large trucks laden with construction materials or oinking pigs, their drivers sleeping in the cabs. Liu and members of the crew wandered into the 24-hour convenience store and strolled down its brightly lit aisles. She picked up a bag of chocolates and a red sugary concoction labeled ''Wang Zai Milk Drink.'' A bit nostalgic, she said with a sigh, ''It's my favorite from my teenage years.'' And then, though half asleep, she had the good grace to offer to translate between Mandarin and English, between the drowsy Sinopec store clerk and the black-clad New York makeup artist. ''Yes, we have chips,'' Liu said. ''Shrimp flavor or cheese flavor?''
ESSENTIALS Hunan Province SIGHTS Yuelu Academy Founded in 976, the Yuelu Academy of Classical Learning, in Changsha, is one of the oldest schools in China. In 1903, it was formally converted to a public university. (In 1926, it was renamed Hunan University.) The grounds include a temple dedicated to Confucius -- revered as a patron of higher learning in ancient China (and lately being reinterpreted by the Chinese Communist Party as a patron of hierarchy and authoritarian government). Stroll through its peaceful, contemplative gardens or hike up the adjacent Mount Yuelu.
Statue of Mao Zedong It's not only ironic Chinese teenagers but also provincial governments who are reclaiming the image of the Chairman (after several decades out of fashion) on everything from T-shirts to key chains to 105-foot stone statues. And Hunan province, the birthplace of Mao, has what might be the best piece of Maomorabilia in the country: a chiseled giant Mao head in Changsha's Juzhou Park, erected in 2009 and depicting the young leader looking decidedly more svelte than the iconic Mao on the 100 RMB note. A shuttle bus runs from the park's gate to the statue.
Temple of Liu A memorial to the eighth-century poet, travel writer and official Liu Zongyuan, the temple was erected in Yongzhou in 814. Liu's celebrated works include Eight Records of Excursions in Yongzhou, depicting his jaunts to the mountains and bamboo forests near the ancient city. The Temple of Liu is on Liuzi Street, on which several quaint old homes have been preserved. It's a nice stroll from the temple to nearby Xiaoshui River.

HEADLINE: 'Napoleon' Is Lost, Long Live 'Napoleon'!

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
SOON after Abel Gance's ''Napoleon'' had its premiere in Paris in 1927, he wrote a letter to his audience, soliciting open eyes and hearts. ''I have made,'' he wrote, ''a tangible effort toward a somewhat richer and more elevated form of cinema.'' He had created a film towering in ambition, scale, cost, narrative and technical innovations, and believed that nothing less than ''the future of the cinema'' was at stake. His audacity had merit. The origins of the widescreen image can be traced to ''Napoleon,'' which also featured hand-held camerawork, eye-blink-fast editing, gorgeous tints, densely layered superimpositions and images shot from a pendulum, a sled, a bicycle and a galloping horse. 
The film was an astonishment, and it was doomed. One hurdle was its length -- his early versions ran from 3 hours to 6 hours 28 minutes (down from 9 hours) -- while other difficulties were posed by Gance's advances, specifically a process later called Polyvision that extended the visual plane into a panorama or three separate images and that required three screens to show it. Partly as a consequence, distributors and exhibitors took harsh liberties: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cut it down to around 70 minutes for the American release, a butchering that seemed to encourage bad reviews. Gance continued to rework the film, adding sound for a 1935 version and, decades later, new material. Yet even as he was taking it apart, others -- notably the British historian Kevin Brownlow -- were trying to restore ''Napoleon'' to its original glory.
In truth ''Napoleon,'' as it was initially hailed, no longer exists, which raises ticklish questions about authorship. In his book on the film, Mr. Brownlow lists 19 versions of ''Napoleon'' -- including those created by distributors, Gance and Mr. Brownlow himself, who for decades has tried to restore the long-lost full version. Mr. Brownlow's latest restoration (Version 20?), will play four times at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival starting next Saturday. But unlike in 1981 -- when an earlier, abridged Brownlow restoration played around the country -- no tour is planned. Yet while this may be the last time this particular iteration is screened in the United States, Francis Ford Coppola's company, American Zoetrope, and the preservationist Robert A. Harris, who own most of the rights, are quietly working with Mr. Brownlow's company and the Cinematheque Francaise on still another restoration.
By the time Gance, who died in 1981 at 92, started on ''Napoleon'' he had already been anointed a cinematic pioneer, primarily for his touching 1919 romance ''J'Accuse,'' set against World War I, and his frenzied 1922 tragedy ''La Roue,'' about desperate desire in a poor railroad family. Both were successes and inspired feverish acclaim. The Cubist painter and future filmmaker Fernand Leger said that with ''La Roue'' Gance had ''elevated the art of film to the plane of the plastic arts.'' Jean Cocteau declared that ''there is cinema before and after 'La Roue' as there is painting before and after Picasso.'' Gance answered this praise with the even more ambitious ''Napoleon,'' calling it ''the greatest film of modern times.''
Gance envisioned making six films about Napoleon. He directed (if revisited) just the one, and it ends in 1796 with the 26-year-old Napoleon (Albert Dieudonne) leading the French Army into Italy for what became known as the First Italian Campaign. What Gance was after wasn't a melodramatic tale, say, about Napoleon and his lady love, Josephine -- ''I have made the minimum concession to the romantic'' -- but something more psychologically evolved. What interested him was History, capital H. Napoleon, he said, was a ''paroxysm in his time just as his time was a paroxysm of history.'' It's hard not to think Gance was also talking about himself.
Budget woes forced him to settle for an abridged telling of Napoleon's life, but this was about the only limitation that he allowed. Cinema was young, and so was he, and he burned with ambition for both the art and his film. He wanted viewers not simply to watch ''Napoleon,'' but also to become participants in a revolution of his making. To that end he liberated the camera, setting it in almost constant motion. For a schoolyard snowball fight during Napoleon's childhood, the camera was attached to a cameraman's body, which allowed Gance to thrust the viewer into the melee. He sought a similar immersion with Polyvision, which tripled the image size. For one critic these enlarged visuals meant that the ''spectators suddenly become a crowd watching a crowd''; they also helped inspire Henri Chretien to invent CinemaScope.
''Napoleon,'' under its full title ''Napoleon Vu par Abel Gance,'' had its admirers when Gance rushed an edit of three or so hours into the Theatre National de l'Opera for the premiere, where, as Mr. Brownlow writes in his book, the audience included the future enemies Marshal Petain and Charles de Gaulle. Gance's problems during production, including budget shortfalls and on-set calamities, were as well known as his brilliance. Perhaps because of the buildup, and because of some technical mishaps during the premiere, the reviews were strong but conditional. A few critics attacked its spectacular advances; one labeled the film ''a Bonaparte for apprentice fascists.''
''Napoleon'' was brutally received in the United States when it, or rather the MGM hatchet job, was released here in 1929. In one review a wisenheimer at Variety wrote that it was ''made by the French for the French.'' The film ''doesn't mean anything to the great horde of picture house goers over here,'' he continued. ''Nap wasn't good looking enough and they didn't put in the right scenes for the flaps here.'' Then, because of a series of untimely events -- including the advent of sound -- the full ''Napoleon'' disappeared, becoming one of cinema's most elusive objects of desire, alongside Erich Von Stroheim's nearly 10-hour version of ''Greed.''
Soon after its premiere ''Napoleon'' was almost immediately chopped up and reimagined, including by Gance. In 1935 he turned ''Napoleon'' into a 2-hour-15-minute sound film newly titled ''Napoleon Bonaparte,'' for which the original actors, including Antonin Artaud, who played Marat, dubbed their lines. In 1955 -- a year after the 15-year-old Kevin Brownlow bought a two-reel, home-movie copy of the silent ''Napoleon,'' beginning an archival quest of a lifetime -- Gance fiddled with the sound version. And then in 1970 he went back to both the silent and sound versions, shot new material, added narration and called the resulting 4 hours 45 minutes ''Bonaparte and the Revolution.'' That same year Mr. Brownlow showed his first reconstruction of the silent ''Napoleon.''
Gance once said that ''when you find yourself with a completed film, you are still far from having realized your dream.'' Perhaps that explains why he kept returning to ''Napoleon,'' his last significant work and a haunting presence in his life. In 1928 he began a second feature about Napoleon, only to sell the script. He languished in the sound era and later fell on hard financial times. Francois Truffaut gave him money, and Claude Lelouch produced ''Bonaparte and the Revolution'' and also bought the rights to the silent ''Napoleon.'' As auteurism took hold and, especially, as Mr. Brownlow's reconstructions were seen and loved -- Mr. Coppola's name on the 1981 release helped spread the word in America -- Gance was discovered anew.
''Napoleon'' never entirely disappeared, and those of us who were lucky enough to have seen the four-hour version at Radio City Music Hall in 1981 were thrilled to discover it. That edition, restored by Mr. Brownlow (originally to 4 hours 50 minutes) and presented by Mr. Coppola and Mr. Harris (who, partly to avoid union overtime, cut that restoration and played it at a faster speed), was the cinema event of the year, racking up ecstatic reviews and strong sales. After Radio City the four-hour cut -- with the composer Carmine Coppola conducting his score with various orchestras -- conquered America. As Variety put it, ''Napoleon'' ''wows'' them in New Orleans, and ''Syracuse Is Also Hotsy.'' By the end of 1981 it had pulled in $2.5 million and was one of the foreign film hits of the year.
Afterward this four-hour ''Napoleon'' was shown infrequently and never released on DVD in America, though it was put out on VHS and laserdisc. Mr. Brownlow's complete restoration never made it over here, until now. The reasons are clouded, and in keeping with the film's tortured history. In 2004, at the National Film Theater in London, Mr. Brownlow said Francis Ford Coppola had ''suppressed the full version for the last 23 years.'' Mr. Brownlow suggested that the problem was the score by Carmine Coppola (father of Francis) fit the four-hour cut shown in 1981 and not Mr. Brownlow's restoration, which by 2000 had grown to its present 5 hours 31 minutes. At the time he said he hoped it could be sorted out, and clearly something has been agreed upon, although the details remain murky.
When I recently reached Mr. Brownlow, who spoke by phone from his London office, he declined to talk about Francis Ford Coppola's past involvement with ''Napoleon.'' ''No way we can go into that,'' he said. James Mockoski, who works as an archivist at Zoetrope, was similarly reluctant to discuss the past. The presentation at the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, he said by phone, ''is something that people wanted to see and has been long in coming.'' Mr. Mockoski said the reason ''Napoleon'' hadn't been shown in the United States came down to simple economics: it's expensive. ''We are a small company,'' he said. ''It's not like this is bringing a lot of money in.'' He added, ''Of course we want people to see it.''
''Napoleon'' doesn't come cheap, especially when accompanied by a full orchestra, as it will be at the festival, where Carl Davis will conduct his score with the Oakland East Bay Symphony. (The film is being shown at the 3,000-seat Art Deco Paramount Theater in Oakland because there isn't a screen big enough in San Francisco.) These four shows, according to the festival's executive director, Stacey Wisnia, will cost about $720,000. The print and its rights alone run about $130,000; the symphony, conductor and understudy eat up another $240,000. The festival is hoping movie lovers will be so tempted by ''Napoleon'' that they'll pay $40 to $120 a ticket for an event that begins in the afternoon and incorporates three intermissions, including a dinner break.
For American cinephiles there's an indisputable reason to see ''Napoleon'' now: film. ''This print will probably never be seen again in the United States,'' Mr. Harris said, given that a digital restoration is under way. (Version 21?) ''Projectors are going away,'' he said and, alas, so too is film. Mr. Harris agreed with the characterization of the festival screenings as a kind of a test run for the digital restoration, which suggests that he and Zoetrope have plans for future exploitation, including, maybe, a DVD and Blu-ray. Over its history ''Napoleon'' has been taken apart and pieced back together by so many hands, and it's somehow survived distributor assaults, Gance's tinkering, legal suits, rights claims and dueling restorations. In the end all that should matter is that this elusive, seemingly indestructible film -- which, as Mr. Brownlow said, has ''found its place again in world cinema'' -- be seen.

HEADLINE: Morgan Miller and Minh Nguyen

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SCHOCH

 BODY:
RELATIONSHIPS born of the passion and excitement of the presidential campaign trail are known to be fickle. With ballots counted and confetti swept away, only the most resilient survive the succeeding election cycles.
The setting for the start of Morgan Miller's and Minh Nguyen's romance was the California Democratic convention in 2004, one of the unofficial stops to nominating a presidential candidate. That January, Ms. Miller, then a junior at the University of California, Los Angeles, had just arrived in San Jose, where it was held that year, and was craving her first political job as a convention volunteer.
She and her classmates, known to one another as the Bruin Democrats, a campus group, milled in a hallway of the San Jose Convention Center, impatiently awaiting their first assignment. Then Mr. Nguyen, the volunteer coordinator, stepped off the escalator, looking thoroughly businesslike in the requisite black suit and blue tie, walkie-talkie in hand.
''He stopped and went, 'Oh, hi,' and turned on the charm,'' recalled Ms. Miller, now 28 and a director of political research at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. in Washington. She said she paid little heed, instead feeling a rush of disappointment at the job awaiting her group -- working the registration booth -- far from the excitement inside the main hall. 
''Boring,'' she thought.
The next day, the Bruins abruptly got a new assignment, smack inside the hall, at a high-dollar fund-raising dinner. Mr. Nguyen kept checking in on them, which Ms. Miller found ''sort of weird.''
In truth, with that first meeting, Mr. Nguyen, now 30 and an assistant director of organization and field services for the American Federation of Teachers in Washington, remembered feeling inexplicably drawn to Ms. Miller.
''There was a strange magnetic feeling,'' he said. ''I had to go back to talk to her, over and over again.''
Mr. Nguyen asked her to dinner at a local Italian restaurant, ostensibly to compensate for the fact that Ms. Miller had had no time to eat at the fund-raiser. She was tired and wanted to see friends, so he invited a crowd of Bruins to accompany them. He asked for her e-mail address, and a few days later, a message arrived, thanking her for her work. She discovered that he wasn't some ''older political hack'' but a college student like her, a senior up north at the University of California, Davis.
Soon they were exchanging instant messages. Small talk turned into long conversations. They learned that they shared modest backgrounds and strong family roots.
Mr. Nguyen's parents and siblings had fled Vietnam in a crammed fishing boat in 1980, before he was born. Rescued by a cargo ship, they lived in a refugee camp in Malaysia before settling in Ventura County, north of Los Angeles. His father started a gardening business; his mother was a manicurist. Like his parents, he is Buddhist.
Ms. Miller grew up Roman Catholic in the Los Angeles County town of Redondo Beach. Her father, the late Kenneth D. Miller, an avid Democrat who died on the day she and her twin sister turned 18, had been a salesman for E. & J. Gallo Winery who headed the distillers' union local. He raised his daughters on stories about state labor history and political figures like Mario Cuomo, Bill Clinton and Cesar Chavez.
Before long, Mr. Nguyen had learned to tolerate Ms. Miller's fondness for ''everything Disney,'' including its films and amusement parks. They became best friends, and by July 2004 found themselves at the Democratic National Convention in Boston, where they shared a hotel room with four other young staff members.
Now and then, Ms. Miller caught him looking at her in a different way, even flirting a little. She was receptive. But it stopped there.
Mr. Nguyen admits he is shy, a classic nerd. ''It took me over a year to muster the will to convince myself she actually liked me,'' he said. His friends shook their heads and complained, ''Come on, dude.''
Against the backdrop of a rough-and-tumble, demanding campaign, even Kevin M. Acebo, the couple's boss at the California Democratic Party, took notice of the developing relationship. ''It was extremely cute and touching and rather innocent,'' he said.
One spring day in 2005, Mr. Nguyen was seated on a couch watching television with Ms. Miller, Mr. Nguyen said, when he impulsively leaned over and kissed her.
''My reaction was, 'It's about time,' '' said Ms. Miller, who, with that first kiss, began to imagine herself marrying him.
Mr. Nguyen was in love, too. But he began working 16-hour days in a combative 2005 union-backed campaign to block ballot measures proposed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who said they were needed to reform state government.
Ms. Miller, newly graduated from U.C.L.A., moved to Washington, where landing a job, not romance, was on her mind. Her relationship with Mr. Nguyen seemed stalled, possibly finished.
Back in California, the election won, the ballot items defeated, Mr. Nguyen had plenty of time to think about the woman who had left him behind.
He flew to Washington and went straight to Ms. Miller's office at the National Democratic Institute the next day, unannounced, and left her a note. He returned to walk her home, and she came out to meet him, bundled up in an unfamiliar thick coat and scarf to fend off winter.
''My breath was totally taken away,'' he said. ''She was absolutely gorgeous.'' As they walked toward Dupont Circle, he told her that he was in Washington only because she was there, and he was fully committed to staying with her, leaving career, family and friends behind.
That clinched it for Ms. Miller. ''As cheesy as it sounds, my heart melted. And I knew I was going to spend the rest of my life with this guy.''
With the arrival of the 2008 presidential election, both became fully immersed in the campaign, doing political work at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. They mostly agreed politically. Although Ms. Miller initially favored the Democratic contender John Edwards and Mr. Nguyen campaigned early for Hillary Rodham Clinton, the couple united behind Barack Obama.
But after the election, they hit a tough stretch, with both unemployed and living on canned chili and spaghetti. They stopped going out and lived like hermits, Ms. Miller said. ''Washington is not necessarily a good town to be poor in.''
Still, they found new political jobs, and they managed to weather other strains -- she stayed in town; he became what a friend called ''one of the fly guys,'' on the road most of the week -- that can doom many relationships.
Unbeknownst to Ms. Miller, that period of having survived unemployment together had inspired Mr. Nguyen to start saving for a ring. ''If we could live through that, I was like, 'Let's just make this official,' '' Mr. Nguyen said.
He took her to New York City for Labor Day 2010, on the eve of the final push for the November elections. A smart political advance man, he woke up at dawn to check out Gapstow Bridge in Central Park, where, years before, the couple had found a small heart carved in stone. Someone had scribbled near the heart in marker, and he scrubbed it off with cleaning fluid.
Later he led Ms. Miller back to that spot and pulled out a ring. She was shocked. Then he was down on one knee, asking her to marry him. She hugged him and said yes.
They were married March 3, on the brink of yet another election season. Mr. Acebo, their former boss, who received designation from Los Angeles County as a deputy marriage commissioner, officiated at the Portofino Hotel and Yacht Club in Redondo Beach.
Guests gathered outside in the sun as sailboats and kayakers glided by. Nearby, sea lions barked as the music began, and Ms. Miller walked down the aisle in an ivory lace Oleg Cassini dress with a fluffy lace train.
Later, the couple changed into traditional Vietnamese gowns, called ao dai, for a tea ceremony to thank their parents, Susan M. Miller and Trung Nguyen and Di V. Nguyen. The luncheon featured a program designed like a ballot and red-white-and-blue buttons reading ''Miller-Nguyen 2012.''
The bride loves using Twitter -- ''it's the campaign thing in me''-- but when her twin sister, Lauren Miller, now the director of new media for Elizabeth Warren, Democratic candidate for United States Senate in Massachusetts, asked, ''Does this mean I get to tweet the wedding from the altar?'' she knew she had to draw a line.
She told her sister no, and assigned her to hold her bouquet and fluff her long ivory train.
Nevertheless, the couple's political friends snapped photos with cellphones and tweeted from the wedding, using its own Twitter hashtag -- which, in the end, the sisters had agreed to create in tandem.

HEADLINE: Out of N.B.A., Working for U.S.A.

BYLINE: By PETER MAY

 BODY:
When Mike Krzyzewski takes a seat on the United States men's basketball bench during the London Olympics this summer, he could well be joined by two unemployed assistants but no coaches with N.B.A. jobs on a team full of N.B.A. players. 
The former Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni and the former Portland Trail Blazers coach Nate McMillan are the two coaches with N.B.A. experience on the national team's staff. The other assistant is Syracuse's Jim Boeheim. Krzyzewski is Duke's coach.
D'Antoni and McMillan joined the unemployed ranks last week. D'Antoni resigned Wednesday, and his team beat McMillan's Trail Blazers by 42 points that night. McMillan was fired Thursday.
Neither move affected their standing on the national team coaching staff, said Craig Miller of USA Basketball.
''They've been with us since 2006, and they meet all the selection criteria,'' Miller said in a telephone interview.
The criteria, according to USA Basketball, include three years of coaching experience at the time of selection as well as experience in international basketball. D'Antoni, who played and coached in Italy, was the coach of the Phoenix Suns when he joined Krzyzewski's staff.
McMillan and D'Antoni could land new N.B.A. jobs by the time the United States team opens training camp in Las Vegas in July. McMillan's name has been linked to a possible opening in Charlotte, should the Bobcats make a change. He played at North Carolina State.
The current four-man coaching staff for the national team was selected in 2006 after Jerry Colangelo took over USA Basketball after an embarrassing showing at the 2004 Olympics in Athens. The national team took the bronze medal at the 2006 world championship in Japan, then won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 world championship.
Should McMillan and D'Antoni remain on the staff, some potentially interesting situations could develop. Two Knicks, Carmelo Anthony and Tyson Chandler, are on the 20-man roster listed on USA Basketball's Web site.
Anthony, with whom D'Antoni feuded in their time together in New York, seems assured of making the team; he was fourth in scoring on the 2008 gold medal team.
Chandler was a member of the gold medal-winning 2010 world championship team in Turkey the summer before he played his one N.B.A. season in Dallas. Portland's LaMarcus Aldridge is also on the 20-man roster. He has yet to play for the senior national team in international competition.
The Americans will hold their Olympic training camp from July 6 to 11 at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. That will be followed by a July 12 exhibition in Las Vegas against the Dominican Republic, whose coach last year was Kentucky's John Calipari. The United States team also will train in Washington from July 12 to 15, with a game against Brazil; in Manchester, England, from July 17 to 19, with a game against Britain; and in Barcelona, Spain, from July 20 to 25 with a game against Spain.
The Olympic Games run from July 27 to Aug. 12.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Of Jobs, Loans and Timing

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
IF searching for a new job and refinancing a home are both on the agenda, you might be wondering which task you should finish first.
Mortgage experts generally recommend that homeowners complete their refinancing before making any major career changes, especially if they are planning to start their own business or become an independent contractor, in which case income may fluctuate.
''There's no real reason to wait unless you don't qualify'' with current income, said Matt Hackett, the underwriting manager for Equity Now, a direct mortgage lender in New York City. 
The job market has been steadily improving. The unemployment rate fell to 8.3 percent in February from 9.0 percent in February 2011. And data released this month from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that more people quitting their jobs this year are doing so voluntarily.
But depending on work history and mortgage lender, just being in the market for a new job might hinder a person's ability to refinance or buy a home.
''If you're actively looking to leave your job, it will impact how the bank views giving you a mortgage,'' said Jason Auerbach, a divisional manager of First Choice Loan Services in Manhattan. The search raises ''a question mark about their future employment'' and income, he added.
In addition to checking employment at the start of the application process, many lenders will verify such information as late as the last 72 hours before mortgage closing. If they learn a borrower is starting a new job in the very near future, the mortgage can be delayed or even derailed. And borrowers who withhold such information could be committing income fraud, Mr. Auerbach said.
Other lenders, however, say they make loans based on a moment-in-time snapshot of a borrower's finances.
''As long as the time when you're closing that loan that you're gainfully employed in the job that you said you were, you're telling the truth,'' said Heidi Yanavich, who trains mortgage loan originators at the McCue Mortgage Company, a direct lender in New Britain, Conn.
Still, Mrs. Yanavich said, the best path is to refinance first and change jobs afterward -- especially if a borrower is changing careers. ''Your success in a new field is not established,'' she said.
An advantage to refinancing first is that ''you are freeing up additional cash flow'' by reducing your monthly payment, said Jodi Glickman, the founder of Great on the Job, a career-training company based in Chicago. Some job changers may earn less at first. ''They are going to be assuming more risk,'' she said, pointing out that they therefore need to reduce their financial risks.
All that said, however, there are advantages to refinancing later, especially for those who might have to relocate when they change jobs, Ms. Glickman said.
A person may well get a new job with more income and responsibility, or in an especially robust industry. That may help him or her qualify for a larger mortgage, or even better terms. According to Mr. Auerbach, you could be able to borrow up to four times your annual income.
Taking a new job right in the middle of a mortgage refinancing, though, could mean extra time and paperwork. Mr. Auerbach, for one, says he will very likely want to see an employment contract or a job offer letter.
Other lenders may want you to wait. Mrs. Yanavich says borrowers may need to provide 30 days of pay stubs and have their employer verify their employment and the time frame of any probationary period.
The Federal Housing Administration, along with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, requires 30 days' pay stubs if the loans are going to be insured by or resold to those entities.
If you're counting on a future bonus, expect to be asked for a letter from your employer verifying that, too.
''Today's lending is pretty conservative,'' Mrs. Yanavich said. ''Incomes need to be documented.''

HEADLINE: How to Avoid That Cramped Seat

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
THERE you are, stuck in the middle seat again. This time you ended up in the row that doesn't recline. The guy in front of you has leaned his seat all the way back, pushing the top of your laptop down just far enough to make it impossible to watch a video. You turn to the onboard menu, hoping a snack might ease your suffering. But by the time the flight attendants reach your seat, everything but the trail mix has been sold out. Sound familiar?
As airlines continue to pack planes and cut service, many passengers are contending with cramped quarters, disgruntled flight attendants and charges for food, pillows, exit-row seats and other formerly free amenities that made the journey slightly more bearable. But carving out some comfort in coach is still possible, if you're willing to work at it.
''Just being in the know and being first to make a seat selection is not going to get you the absolute best seat on the plane,'' said Matthew Daimler, the founder of SeatGuru.com. ''The landscape has changed,'' he said, as more airlines have begun charging extra for better seats. 
But there are also some new options. So-called premium economy -- a roomier class of seats between business and coach -- has long been offered by international carriers on transatlantic flights. But recently, domestic airlines have been adopting the concept. American Airlines, for example, will begin selling Main Cabin Extra seats with 4 to 6 inches of extra legroom for $8 to $108, this spring, starting with its Boeing 777-300s. United Airlines is expanding its Economy Plus rows, which offer 4 to 6 inches of extra legroom for an additional $9 to $159 one-way, to its Continental Airlines fleet. And Delta is introducing Economy Comfort, with an extra 4 inches of legroom, this summer for an introductory charge of $19 to $99 one way.
Of course, airlines save their best seats for their best customers. United, for example, lets top elite frequent fliers sit in the Economy Plus section at no charge. But even if you're not an elite flier, there are other ways to make yourself comfortable. Here are some strategies for finding the best seat.
DON'T SHOP FOR PRICE ALONE. Spirit Airlines and JetBlue both fly A320 aircrafts between Boston and Fort Lauderdale, Fla., but seats are configured very differently, with Spirit packing 178 seats onboard with 174 that don't recline, compared with 150 roomier seats on JetBlue, according to SeatGuru.com, which ranks seat quality. In a recent search for nonstop flights on that route, Spirit Airlines offered the cheapest rate at $247 round trip in coach, not including fees for seat assignments. For $22 more, a traveler could fly JetBlue, which offers free DirectTV at every seat in addition to a seat pitch -- the distance between seats -- of 34 inches in coach compared with 28 on Spirit.
USE TECHNOLOGY TO FIND A BETTER SEAT. Most major airlines let passengers select seats when booking, so be sure to look at diagrams on the airline's homepage to see which spots are open. Then cross-reference your findings with Web sites like SeatGuru or SeatExpert, which offer information like which exit-row seats won't recline. To avoid a middle seat, sign up for free alerts at ExpertFlyer.com. After creating an account, plug in your flight details and select the kind of seat you want -- aisle or window.
If one becomes available, you receive an e-mail so you can contact the airline to nab it. Additional seat alerts are 99 cents each if you need to monitor more than one flight at a time or want to be notified when an exit row or any two seats together open up.
CALL A TRAVEL AGENT. Travel agencies that handle a lot of airline bookings often receive access to special codes or customer support desks that can unblock seats. ''Frequently if you go to the airline Web site, you won't see every available seat,'' said Jim Osborne, the vice president for the airline program at Virtuoso, a network of luxury travel advisers that has special relationships with about 55 airlines.
''With the code, we can see what's available and unblock and assign them,'' Mr. Osborne said. Booking fees typically start at $50 at Virtuoso and go up based on the itinerary. Travel Leaders of Montvale, N.J., which reserves unblocking for repeat clients, charges $30 or more for bookings and says it successfully unblocks seats for customers 75 percent to 85 percent of the time.
BE OPEN TO COMPROMISE. If you are traveling as a couple, one tactic is to reserve a window and aisle in the hopes the middle will stay empty. But with planes so full these days, the chance that middle seat will remain open is rare. Another strategy is to sit across the aisle from each other, so neither ends up in the middle.
PLAY THE NICE CARD. That's how I ended up in a roomy exit row seat (21D) on United flight 1570 from Newark to Denver last month, sipping a free glass of wine. My original seat, 35F, just a couple of rows from the bathrooms at the back, was occupied by a 3-year-old when I boarded. Her mother had apologetically explained that they had been given two middle row seats several aisles apart and were looking for someone who might switch. I mentioned the situation to the attendant, explaining I would take one of those middle seats for the child's sake, but if a window or aisle seat became open, to please let me know. He politely said my chances were slim, but offered to comp me a drink.
Then, after settling into my new middle seat, two young men asked if I'd switch with their friend, also in a middle seat toward the front, so they could all sit together. Moments after that second swap, the attendant caught my eye. ''Looks like this one is open,'' he said, indicating an aisle seat on an exit row, one of the most desirable seats. I sprawled out, taking full advantage of the extra four inches of legroom.
IF ALL ELSE FAILS. For $19.95, GadgetDuck.com sells the Knee Defender, a set of plastic wedges that slip onto the legs of your tray table and physically prevent the seat in front of you from reclining. The site also provides a courtesy card for travelers whose seat is being blocked, which informs the person in front that reclining would compromise your knees.
''I realize that this may be an inconvenience,'' it continues, ''If so, I hope you will complain to the airline. Maybe working together we can convince the airlines to provide enough space between rows so that people can recline their seats without banging into other passengers.''

HEADLINE: A Monument to a Sioux Warrior, Its Completion Date Somewhat Unclear

BYLINE: By A.G. SULZBERGER

 BODY:
CRAZY HORSE, S.D. -- It was to be the largest sculpture in the world: a granite portrait of a Sioux leader on horseback whittled out of a mountain in the Black Hills here. In scale and complexity, the carving would dwarf the imposing collection of presidential profiles on nearby Mount Rushmore.
As he started the Crazy Horse monument in 1947, short on money, manpower and the credulity of just about anyone who heard his plans, Korczak Ziolkowski, a sculptor from Connecticut, promised the tribal leaders who had recruited him and the local residents who scorned him that he was dedicating his life to the effort.
But he underestimated the scale of the undertaking. His promise, it turned out, was a multigenerational commitment. 
The sprawling country clan Mr. Ziolkowski reared at the base of the mountain has spent the 30 years since his death honoring his final plea to continue the effort, to which he supposedly added, ''But go slowly, so you do it right.''
Now led by his 85-year-old widow, Ruth, with the help of their 10 children and, more recently, their grandchildren, this eccentric family effort has plodded forward through doubts and controversy at a deliberate pace more in keeping with the age of the pyramids than the age of Twitter.
As the mountain carving effort begins its 65th year as one of the top tourist attractions in the state, few family members are deterred by their doubt that any of them will live to see it to completion.
''It's their dream, and they're going to get it done,'' said T. Denny Sanford, a businessman and philanthropist who recently donated $10 million to the project. ''I don't care if it takes another 100 years.''
Though that commitment has been much romanticized, it has also been the focus of persistent criticism, most vocally from American Indians, who have long regarded the project with a mix of support and suspicion. Many complain that the family has made millions of dollars from a project that, while carrying the name and imagined likeness of Crazy Horse, has become more of a monument to the sculptor than to his subject.
Indeed, the bearded, mountain-man profile of Mr. Ziolkowski, who is buried on the grounds, is as ubiquitous as the stern visage of the Sioux leader around the visitor complex. And the 85 full-time staff members at the Crazy Horse Memorial Foundation included more of his descendants (seven) than Indians (five), even though the nearby reservations have some of the highest unemployment rates in the nation.
''I've never heard a single Native American, not one, ever say I'm proud of that mountain,'' said Tim Giago, the founder of Native Sun News, based in nearby Rapid City.
Thomas Shortbull, president of Oglala Lakota College, which receives a number of scholarships from the foundation, acknowledged the discontent. ''But most people see the positive of filling the void of the lack of recognition that we have in this country for Indian people,'' he added.
Now grooming her children to take over, Ms. Ziolkowski, who still lives in the ascetic confines of the log cabin she helped build when she arrived here at age 20, remains the driving force behind the project that many assumed would founder when her husband died.
Instead, her focus on demonstrating progress on the mountain by completing the warrior's face put to rest much of the persistent skepticism. Admission revenues ($3.8 million in 2010, thanks to a $10 entry fee paid by most adults) and donations ($19 million in the last five years) have reached record levels, according to the foundation.
The grandmotherly demeanor that Ms. Ziolkowski uses with strangers masks a fierce, almost obsessive dedication, family and employees said. She personally answers every phone call to the foundation, writes a thank you letter for each donation, and almost never strays out of sight of the mountain.
And while she eagerly shares her time-smoothed stories, some of which seem closer to myth than fact, she has learned from the mistake of her husband -- who boldly predicted that the project would take 30 years -- to remain vague when asked for a timetable for completion.
''Yes, it was bigger and harder than he thought it was going to be,'' she said. ''But we'll keep working at it.''
Ms. Ziolkowski rebuffed criticism of the foundation's relationship with Indians by pointing out that the plans -- little more than a dream at this point -- call for creating a university for Indians on the property. The foundation already hosts programs for Indian students and has given $1.5 million in scholarships. (Indians are not charged for admission.)
The Crazy Horse Memorial, perhaps inevitably, is usually measured against Mount Rushmore, just 17 miles away. Despite past tensions, it has served as inspiration, training ground and occasional partner.
As the presidential busts were being completed in the 1930s, local tribal leaders pushed to include some tribute to Indian heroes as well, given the location: a disputed area that was granted to local tribes by treaty, then taken back after gold was discovered. But the request to add the face of Crazy Horse alongside Washington or Lincoln was declined.
Instead they enlisted Mr. Ziolkowski, who had been fired after working briefly on Mount Rushmore. His ambitious design, measuring 563 feet tall by 641 feet long, was of a warrior with flowing hair and an outstretched arm, sitting on horseback. (Because no authenticated photograph of Crazy Horse is known to exist, there have been complaints about historical accuracy.)
Although the idea originated with Indian leaders -- ''this is to be entirely an Indian project under my direction,'' Henry Standing Bear, a Lakota chief, wrote in a 1939 letter to the sculptor -- Mr. Ziolkowski discovered after his arrival that the local tribes had little to give, either in money or labor, Ms. Ziolkowski said.
Instead, the effort was family driven, supported by donations, tourists and a small livestock operation on land they bought themselves.
After just a year in the still rugged wilderness, Mr. Ziolkowski's first wife had filed for divorce for neglect because of his focus on the mountain. Ruth, who had known him as a teenager in Connecticut and had cut ties with her own family to follow him to South Dakota, had no such problems. They married on Thanksgiving so he would not have to take another day off.
''He was very honest,'' said Ms. Ziolkowski, who had also been previously married. ''He said the mountain comes first, I came second, the kids came third.''
Mount Rushmore was completed in 14 years and for less than $1 million. But here, a half-century of blasting passed before the first visible details of the face emerged. The joke for much of that period was that the only thing crazy about the Crazy Horse Memorial was the sculptor.
Standing in a biting winter wind beneath the enormous face -- the nose alone is 27 feet long -- Casimir Ziolkowski described the mountain carving process as not conducive to shortcuts. He started shoveling blasted rock for his father at age 7, and five decades later he is the foreman of the operation, which consumes about a quarter of the foundation's $7 million annual budget.
He acknowledged occasional doubts about the sanity of the enterprise, but added: ''Us Ziolkowskis will continue to work as long as we can.''
In addition to the jobs with the foundation, the family also owns both the gift shop and the restaurant at the visitor center. And though they donated much of their property to the foundation, they have made at least $2 million selling other parcels to it.
Jack Marsh, a longtime journalist who has served on the foundation board, dismissed financial concerns. The board had to persuade Ms. Ziolkowski, who sleeps in a chair in a room she shares with a daughter, to take a higher salary to match her workload, he said.
''The Ziolkowski family, to the person, leads modest lifestyles,'' he said, ''and they have truly dedicated their lives to the project.''
The most recent family addition to the staff, Heidi Ziolkowski, 26, one of the two dozen grandchildren, is now responsible for turning fragments of blasted rock into candleholders, bookends and other souvenirs. She says she is in it for the long haul, even if she, too, wonders whether she will live to see it finished.
''The older I get, the more I kind of feel like I need to be here,'' she said.

HEADLINE: The Banks Win, Again

 BODY:
Last week was a big one for the banks. On Monday, the foreclosure settlement between the big banks and federal and state officials was filed in federal court, and it is now awaiting a judge's all-but-certain approval. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve announced the much-anticipated results of the latest round of bank stress tests.
How did the banks do on both? Pretty well, thank you -- and better than homeowners and American taxpayers. 
That is not only unfair, given banks' huge culpability in the mortgage bubble and financial meltdown. It also means that homeowners and the economy still need more relief, and that the banks, without more meaningful punishment, will not be deterred from the next round of misbehavior.
Under the terms of the settlement, the banks will provide $26 billion worth of relief to borrowers and aid to states for antiforeclosure efforts. In exchange, they will get immunity from government civil lawsuits for a litany of alleged abuses, including wrongful denial of loan modifications and wrongful foreclosures. That $26 billion is paltry compared with the scale of wrongdoing and ensuing damage, including 4 million homeowners who have lost their homes, 3.3 million others who are in or near foreclosure, and more than 11 million borrowers who are underwater by $700 billion.
The settlement could also end up doing more to clean up the banks' books than to help homeowners. Banks will be required to provide at least $17 billion worth of principal-reduction loan modifications and other relief, like forbearance for unemployed homeowners. Compelling the banks to do principal write-downs is an undeniable accomplishment of the settlement. But the amount of relief is still tiny compared with the problem. And the banks also get credit toward their share of the settlement for other actions that should be required, not rewarded.
For instance, they will receive 50 cents in credit for every dollar they write down on second liens that are 90 to 179 days past due, and 10 cents in credit for every dollar they write down on second liens that are 180 days or more overdue. At those stages of delinquency, the write-downs bring no relief to borrowers who have long since defaulted. Rather than subsidizing the banks' costs to write down hopelessly delinquent loans, regulators should be demanding that banks write them off and take the loss -- and bring some much needed transparency to the question of whether the banks properly value their assets.
The settlement's complex formulas for delivering relief also give the banks too much discretion to decide who gets help, what kind of help, and how much. The result could be that fewer borrowers get help, because banks will be able to structure the relief in ways that are more advantageous for them than for borrowers. The Obama administration has said the settlement will provide about one million borrowers with loan write-downs, but private analysts have put the number at 500,000 to 700,000 over the next three years.
The settlement's go-easy-on-the-banks approach might be understandable if the banks were still hunkered down. But most of the banks -- which still benefit from crisis-era support in the form of federally backed debt and near zero interest rates -- passed the recent stress tests, paving the way for Fed approval to increase dividends and share buybacks, if not immediately, then as soon as possible.
When it comes to helping homeowners, banks are treated as if they still need to be protected from drains on their capital. But when it comes to rewarding executives and other bank shareholders, paying out capital is the name of the game. And at a time of economic weakness, using bank capital for investor payouts leaves the banks more exposed to shocks. So homeowners are still bearing the brunt of the mortgage debacle. Taxpayers are still supporting too-big-to-fail banks. And banks are still not being held accountable.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN HAIDT. 
Jonathan Haidt is a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia and a visiting professor of business ethics at N.Y.U.'s Stern School of Business. Parts of this essay were excerpted from ''The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion,'' which was just released.

 BODY:
In the film version of ''All the President's Men,'' when Robert Redford, playing the journalist Bob Woodward, is struggling to unravel the Watergate conspiracy, an anonymous source advises him to ''follow the money.'' It's a good rule of thumb for understanding the behavior of politicians. But following the money leads you astray if you're trying to understand voters.
Self-interest, political scientists have found, is a surprisingly weak predictor of people's views on specific issues. Parents of children in public school are not more supportive of government aid to schools than other citizens. People without health insurance are not more likely to favor government-provided health insurance than are people who are fully insured.
Despite what you might have learned in Economics 101, people aren't always selfish. In politics, they're more often groupish. When people feel that a group they value -- be it racial, religious, regional or ideological -- is under attack, they rally to its defense, even at some cost to themselves. We evolved to be tribal, and politics is a competition among coalitions of tribes. 
The key to understanding tribal behavior is not money, it's sacredness. The great trick that humans developed at some point in the last few hundred thousand years is the ability to circle around a tree, rock, ancestor, flag, book or god, and then treat that thing as sacred. People who worship the same idol can trust one another, work as a team and prevail over less cohesive groups. So if you want to understand politics, and especially our divisive culture wars, you must follow the sacredness.
A good way to follow the sacredness is to listen to the stories that each tribe tells about itself and the larger nation. The Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith once summarized the moral narrative told by the American left like this: ''Once upon a time, the vast majority'' of people suffered in societies that were ''unjust, unhealthy, repressive and oppressive.'' These societies were ''reprehensible because of their deep-rooted inequality, exploitation and irrational traditionalism -- all of which made life very unfair, unpleasant and short. But the noble human aspiration for autonomy, equality and prosperity struggled mightily against the forces of misery and oppression and eventually succeeded in establishing modern, liberal, democratic, capitalist, welfare societies.'' Despite our progress, ''there is much work to be done to dismantle the powerful vestiges of inequality, exploitation and repression.'' This struggle, as Smith put it, ''is the one mission truly worth dedicating one's life to achieving.''
This is a heroic liberation narrative. For the American left, African-Americans, women and other victimized groups are the sacred objects at the center of the story. As liberals circle around these groups, they bond together and gain a sense of righteous common purpose.
Contrast that narrative with one that Ronald Reagan developed in the 1970s and '80s for conservatism. The clinical psychologist Drew Westen summarized the Reagan narrative like this: ''Once upon a time, America was a shining beacon. Then liberals came along and erected an enormous federal bureaucracy that handcuffed the invisible hand of the free market. They subverted our traditional American values and opposed God and faith at every step of the way.'' For example, ''instead of requiring that people work for a living, they siphoned money from hard-working Americans and gave it to Cadillac-driving drug addicts and welfare queens.'' Instead of the ''traditional American values of family, fidelity and personal responsibility, they preached promiscuity, premarital sex and the gay lifestyle'' and instead of ''projecting strength to those who would do evil around the world, they cut military budgets, disrespected our soldiers in uniform and burned our flag.'' In response, ''Americans decided to take their country back from those who sought to undermine it.''
This, too, is a heroic narrative, but it's a heroism of defense. In this narrative it's God and country that are sacred -- hence the importance in conservative iconography of the Bible, the flag, the military and the founding fathers. But the subtext in this narrative is about moral order. For social conservatives, religion and the traditional family are so important in part because they foster self-control, create moral order and fend off chaos. (Think of Rick Santorum's comment that birth control is bad because it's ''a license to do things in the sexual realm that is counter to how things are supposed to be.'') Liberals are the devil in this narrative because they want to destroy or subvert all sources of moral order.
Actually, there's a second subtext in the Reagan narrative in which liberty is the sacred object. Circling around liberty would seem, on its face, to be more consistent with liberalism and its many liberation movements than with social conservatism. But here's where narrative analysis really helps. Part of Reagan's political genius was that he told a single story about America that rallied libertarians and social conservatives, who are otherwise strange bedfellows. He did this by presenting liberal activist government as the single devil that is eternally bent on destroying two different sets of sacred values -- economic liberty and moral order. Only if all nonliberals unite into a coalition of tribes can this devil be defeated.
If you follow the sacredness, you can understand some of the weirdness of the last few months in politics. In January, the Obama administration announced that religiously affiliated hospitals and other institutions must offer health plans that provide free contraception to their members. It's one thing for the government to insist that people have a right to buy a product that their employer abhors. But it's a rather direct act of sacrilege (for many Christians) for the government to force religious institutions to pay for that product. The outraged reaction galvanized the Christian right and gave a lift to Rick Santorum's campaign.
AROUND this time, bills were making their way through state legislatures requiring that women undergo a medically unnecessary ultrasound before they can have an abortion. It's one thing for a state government to make abortions harder to get (as with a waiting period). But it's a rather direct act of sacrilege (for nearly all liberals as well as libertarians) for a state to force a doctor to insert a probe into a woman's vagina. The outraged reaction galvanized the secular left and gave a lift to President Obama.
This is why we've seen the sudden re-emergence of the older culture war -- the one between the religious right and the secular left that raged for so many years before the financial crisis and the rise of the Tea Party. When sacred objects are threatened, we can expect a ferocious tribal response. The right perceives a ''war on Christianity'' and gears up for a holy war. The left perceives a ''war on women'' and gears up for, well, a holy war.
The timing could hardly be worse. America faces multiple threats and challenges, many of which will require each side to accept a ''grand bargain'' that imposes, at the very least, painful compromises on core economic values. But when your opponent is the devil, bargaining and compromise are themselves forms of sacrilege.

THE EMERGENCY STATE
America's Pursuit of Absolute Security at All Costs
By David C. Unger
359 pp. The Penguin Press. $27.95.
With Osama bin Laden dead, American troops leaving Iraq, the economy still sputtering and Congress locked in yet another budget showdown, one thing that seems clear is that Washington will very likely cut military spending sometime soon. This will come as welcome news to David C. Unger, author of ''The Emergency State'' and an editorial writer for The New York Times. In this angry new book, Unger deplores what he sees as Washington's obsession with security and overreliance on military and intelligence capabilities, arguing that they are dangerous perversions of the country's Jeffersonian traditions.
Presidents since Franklin Roosevelt, in Unger's view, have inflated external threats in order to build up a vast and unaccountable national security machine that runs roughshod over the framers' design for a modest government with plenty of internal checks and few international obligations. This emergency state, as Unger calls it, not only expands presidential powers, wastes money and tramples the rights of Americans and foreigners, but it also fails to guard the country from today's real dangers. 
In a narrative familiar to anyone who's leafed through the growing library of books on Imperial America, Unger takes up his tale in 1941, when Roosevelt -- whom Unger calls ''the godfather'' of the emergency state -- maneuvered an isolationist Congress and an indifferent American public into siding with Britain in its fight against Germany. Setting a disturbingly familiar precedent, Roosevelt also relied on extralegal means to track domestic ''subversives'' -- who were sometimes just political opponents.
From there, in Unger's opinion, things just got worse. Truman borrowed Roosevelt's tactics and made a terrible blunder by initiating a strategy of containment against a Soviet Union that need not have become America's enemy in a globalized cold war. Running this worldwide campaign required a large and permanent defense establishment and the creation of a whole new set of executive branch institutions like the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council.
Unger draws a line from the policies of Roosevelt and Truman straight to the worst abuses of the George W. Bush administration -- think of Iraq, enemy combatants, torture and illegal wiretaps -- with only a few zigzags in the 1970s and '80s, when Congress temporarily pushed back against presidential overreach. Even Barack Obama gets lumped into this dark company. He came into office with a powerful mandate to roll back abuses, Unger argues, but reneged on some of his promises, like shutting down Guantanamo, while extending such questionable Bush policies as targeted killings of suspected terrorists (including American citizens). But then not one president in the last 70 years escapes Unger's scourge.
All of this may prove persuasive to many of those already opposed to the nation's high level of military spending or prone to see sinister motives behind the secretive conduct of its diplomacy and intelligence. But ''The Emergency State'' is unlikely to win new converts. For one thing, Unger never really explains how he thinks the presidents he looks at should have dealt with the enormous international challenges of the past 70 years, from the Nazi and Soviet threats to global jihad. For another, Unger's proposed solutions range from those that are correct but vague (less secrecy; a foreign policy that concentrates more on long-term problems) to those that are implausible. He concludes his book with 10 specific recommendations that amount to leaving more of international affairs to Congress: the same Congress that can't agree on a budget today and has blocked Obama's attempts to shut down Guantanamo.
Worse, Unger overlooks the fact that the costs of America's postwar strategy, while real, have been relatively minor compared with its successes, which have created a generally open, peaceful, rule-bound international order allowing the United States, its allies and developing states like China, India and Brazil to thrive as never before.
That order is looking pretty creaky right now, and budget constraints may nudge Washington in the direction Unger wants. We can only hope the results of a less forceful America are as benign as he expects them to be.

HEADLINE: Mortal Cops Cling to Life on the Air

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
A RECENT episode of the police drama ''Southland'' ended with a gang member stabbing Detective Lydia Adams in the stomach during a routine arrest. Only the audience knew she was pregnant and running late for an ob-gyn checkup.
''This isn't the type of show you can watch while eating or folding your laundry,'' said the actor Michael Cudlitz, who plays Officer John Cooper on ''Southland.'' ''Our show isn't easy to watch.''
It's even harder to fit into the current television landscape.
In 2009 NBC canceled ''Southland'' after seven episodes. TNT, the basic-cable channel, ran six remaining episodes, and last year TNT introduced the first 10-episode season produced specifically for it. 
The premise was the same -- a cathartic ride-along with flawed but committed Los Angeles police officers as they patrol the city's seediest streets -- but basic-cable budgets meant fewer characters and car chases.
''Southland'' concludes its fourth season on TNT on Tuesday and once again teeters on the verge of cancellation, despite the kind of critical acclaim not lavished on a cop drama since ''The Wire'' on HBO. Writing in The New York Times, Mike Hale extolled the show's ''excellent performances and superior production values,'' while The Wall Street Journal's Nancy deWolf Smith compared ''Southland'' to ''a hot date on a Saturday night'' that delivers a rush ''like nothing else on TV.''
That ''Southland'' has struggled speaks to a broader predicament in television. In an increasingly crowded market, network executives prefer the novel (ABC's sci-fi series ''The River''), the loud (NBC's musical ''Smash'') or the elaborate (Fox's just-canceled dinosaur drama ''Terra Nova''). Those shows have struggled to hang on to viewers who initially tuned in because of the unique premises and expensive marketing campaigns splashed across buses and billboards. Yet while ''Southland'' may be too serialized and uncomfortable for network outlets, it's also too mainstream for premium channels like HBO or Showtime.
Unlike their network television counterparts, the cops in ''Southland'' don't have superhuman skills or a knack for cracking jokes while standing over a corpse. Instead, Regina King's Detective Adams has an unplanned pregnancy with a married man. The rookie Ben Sherman (Ben McKenzie) punches a rowdy but harmless high school girl in the face, an act that inevitably ends up on YouTube. And Cooper is a once-closeted gay man fighting an addiction to oxycodone.
Shot with a shaky camera in cinema verite style, ''Southland'' has a you-are-there flavor meant to evoke the reality show ''Cops.'' Each episode opens with the guttural voice of an omniscient narrator imparting police wisdom to viewers. ''As cops become more experienced, their confidence inevitably grows,'' the narrator warned at the opening of the episode in which Ms. King's character is attacked. ''Confidence can lead them to take more risks, that's when they're in real danger.''
The ''Southland'' executive producer Christopher Chulack, who was a director and executive producer on ''ER'' and ''Third Watch,'' said: ''We wanted it to have a documentary feel.'' (Another ''ER'' veteran, John Wells, also serves as an executive producer of ''Southland.'') Of his current series, Mr. Chulack said: ''I wanted it to be imperfect. The camera work is imperfect. The sound is imperfect.''
At the same time the ''NYPD Blue'' writer Ann Biderman, who created ''Southland,'' gave it the feel of an updated homage to classic cop shows like ''Hill Street Blues'' and ''Homicide: Life on the Street.'' Narrative threads and character arcs tie seasons together, but within each hourlong episode multiple crimes come together, often in morally ambiguous ways.
In a recent episode a white woman shoots a black man in the gut as he runs after her in a parking lot. She later finds out he was trying to return her keys. Handcuffed and on the way to jail, the woman tearily admits she'd recently been raped by a black man.
''We're not doing linear, narrative story lines that will have everything wrapped up in a neat bow at the end,'' Mr. Cudlitz said.
That heady mix of open-ended crimes and cops with complicated personal lives makes ''Southland'' a throwback, a tricky proposition in television today.
''The unfortunate reality of programming is that in the 300-channel-plus space it's all about breaking through the clutter,'' said Michael Wright, executive vice president and head of programming at TNT, TBS and Turner Classic Movies. ''You often hear executives say, 'Let's find the show that's never been on before.' ''
TNT will assess whether it will renew ''Southland'' after the season finale this week. The ratings this year -- an average of 1.8 million viewers each episode -- are ''not bad numbers but they're not good numbers,'' Mr. Wright said. ''They're just O.K. numbers.''
''Southland'' beats reruns of ''Law & Order'' and ''CSI: NY,'' but doesn't do as well as some of TNT's original series.
Six times as many viewers watched when the drama was shown on NBC. It doesn't help that TNT is best known for its lighthearted and female-friendly procedurals like ''The Closer'' and ''Rizzoli and Isles,'' which average 7.7 million and 6.5 million viewers each week. TNT has advertised ''Southland'' during FX's ''Justified'' in hopes of luring that channel's young, male viewers.
''Clearly it's a challenged show these days,'' said Peter Roth, president of Warner Brothers Television, the studio that makes ''Southland,'' which, like TNT is owned by Time Warner. ''It's not a sexy, high-concept drama. But it's by far the most realistic-looking life-on-the-street show I've seen.'' He likened the show to the 1970s NBC cop drama ''Police Story,'' also set in the dark corners of Los Angeles.
Detectives on network television abound, but they come in the form of Mark Harmon, the witty naval investigator on CBS's ''NCIS'' or the sleek, sunny worlds of the spinoff ''NCIS: Los Angeles'' and ''CSI: Miami.''
Riskier cop shows tend to have a quirky hook. In NBC's ''Awake'' Detective Michael Britten lives in two alternate realities, one in which his wife has died and another in which his son is dead. He solves crimes in both. In CBS's ''Unforgettable'' Poppy Montgomery plays a New York homicide detective with a rare medical condition that gives her the ability to remember everything.
Police dramas of the more unflinching and serialized variety, like ABC's ''Detroit 1-8-7'' and Fox's ''Chicago Code,'' were canceled after a season. NBC's ''Law & Order: Special Victims Unit'' survives despite cast changes and a ratings drop. CBS will try its hand with a visceral police drama on April 15, when it introduces ''NYC 22,'' a series produced by Robert De Niro that follows rookies patrolling the streets of Upper Manhattan.
''Southland'' has taken some hits with cast departures and a tighter budget that has led to fewer characters with less back story. Last season ''Southland'' had to kill off Detective Nate Moretta when the actor Kevin Alejandro left for a supporting role on HBO's ''True Blood.''Rather than give Nate a hero's farewell, he said a casual hello to a couple of gang members and wound up bludgeoned to death by an unprovoked mob.
This season an unglamorous Lucy Liu stepped in as Officer Jessica Tang, an ambitious patrol cop whose morals are tested when she accidentally shoots a teenager wielding a toy gun. Ms. Liu only signed on for one season.
NBC executives said they canceled ''Southland'' in part because tough economic times meant viewers preferred escapism and blue skies. The network moved ''Southland,'' which was designed as a 10 p.m. drama, to 9 p.m. to make room for the cheaper ''Jay Leno Show,'' which ended up being canceled itself.
A smaller audience on TNT -- which mostly serves up meat-and-potatoes programming to viewers who have an average age of 50 -- has in some ways liberated ''Southland,'' Mr. Wells and Mr. Chulack said.
The drama no longer faces the scrutiny of high-stakes network television. That means the writers haven't had to adjust to feedback from focus groups or network executives who request easier-to-digest story lines.
The cops in ''Southland'' still traverse Los Angeles's sleaziest neighborhoods, graffiti-covered alleyways and ominous parking garages. Mundane tasks like helping a homeless woman cross the street, breaking up a neighborhood fistfight and running after an abused teenager lead to near-death experiences.
''We're just dropping in on the lives of cops and writing what we're interested in,'' Mr. Wells said. ''No one is telling us to add a few more happy endings so we can generate a couple million new viewers.''

HEADLINE: The Soul of the New Hacktivist

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA. 
A technology reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
IN 1988, a Cornell graduate student, Robert Tappan Morris, let loose a computer worm on the fledgling version of the Internet. He said it was meant to be an experiment, but the code he wrote spun out of his control, affecting roughly 50,000 computers connected to the network at the time. Mr. Morris, who happened to be the son of a National Security Agency scientist, became one of the earliest convicted hackers.
Pranksters followed, scrawling their signatures on Web sites for bragging rights. Organized crime found it could extract millions of dollars by hacking into banks. Then, just as the rest of us had gotten used to living much of our lives online, came the hacktivists. 
Calling themselves Anonymous, they hacked into conference calls among agents of the F.B.I. (in January) and broke into the computer networks of the Vatican (last week). It has become impossible to tell who and what Anonymous might target -- or exactly who within Anonymous might be behind it. Critics and defenders argue endlessly about how much of what they do should be treated as political protest -- or strictly as a crime.
Leaderless, multinational and known by the ubiquitous, sly Guy Fawkes mask, Anonymous is fueled by a raft of causes, from repression in Tunisia to animal rights in Tennessee to a defense of the whistle-blower site WikiLeaks.
Whatever the cause, its message is amplified by the Internet itself, as is its impact. At a time when life, commerce and statecraft have gone digital, hacktivists can threaten governments, or they can just as easily dump innocent people's credit card numbers on the Internet for more common criminals to steal.
''The weapon is much more accessible, the technology is more sophisticated,'' said Chenxi Wang, a vice president in charge of security at Forrester Research. ''Everything is online -- your life, my life -- which makes it much more lethal.''
Anonymous, for its part, has spawned a variety of spinoffs. Anybody can be Anonymous. And anybody who calls himself Anonymous can carry out an attack in its name. One hacker in Britain last week, calling himself a member of Anonymous, stole the health records of thousands of women registered with an abortion service provider in Britain. His boasts on Twitter put other Anonymous members in an awkward position, considering that Anonymous also took credit for attacks on the Vatican.
Some factions of Anonymous use brute force to shut down target Web sites. Other factions break into systems and steal data.
They have threatened to take down Internet root servers -- part of the Web's basic infrastructure -- on April Fools' Day, which would effectively shut down the global Internet.
Mary Landesman, a security researcher who now works at Cisco, has tracked cybercrime from its early days, when virus writers showed off their wares on message boards and hackers defaced porn sites for fun. In December 2000, Ms. Landesman saw a lament: A virus writer wondered on a message board where her fellow virus writers had gone. Ms. Landesman took it as a harbinger of the danger ahead: The virus writers had begun to work for people who could pay them, and they kept quiet.
By the early 2000s, a nimble multinational criminal business network had begun to emerge. Hackers could trade in bots and malicious software and help themselves to other people's bank accounts. Soon cyberespionage rings could steal source code.
Politically motivated hackers began to emerge in the late 1990s -- each one with a distinct case and a focused target. Hackers from China and Taiwan dueled against one another. Anti-nuclear activists defaced an Indian government site after the government in New Delhi conducted nuclear tests. Hackers rallied in support of the Zapatistas, an insurgent group in southern Mexico that even in the pre-Twitter days used the Internet to drum up overseas support.
Anonymous rewrote the hacktivist playbook. It began to challenge a far broader political and economic order. ''This really is cyberwar, and I don't use that term in a sensational way,'' said Richard Power, who chronicled the cybercrime of the 1990s in his book ''Tangled Web.'' ''You're looking at not just one particular cause. You're attacking the whole power structure. It involves some core critique.''
Anonymous first took an overtly political turn in 2008, when it set its sights on the Church of Scientology. It soon morphed into a multipurpose, global movement. It turned Twitter into its virtual soapbox, used YouTube to promote its own iconography and cleverly aligned itself with causes popular with young people all over the world, from the Occupy movement to the Arab Spring to Internet censorship.
This week, on one of several Twitter accounts that claim to be affiliated with Anonymous, there came a call to donate money to put up billboards saying ''Don't Mess With the Internet,'' alongside put-downs of ''traitors'' and quotes from Virginia Woolf and Oscar Wilde.
Gabriella Coleman, an anthropologist who studies hacktivist culture, described Anonymous as the modern-day ''trickster,'' at times playful, at others scaring the daylights out of people, and usually slippery. ''Grasping them is very difficult,'' she said, ''putting our finger on them sociologically.''
Anonymity, with a lowercase ''a,'' also makes the movement vulnerable. Those who affiliate with the movement use a variety of tools to cloak their identities and the devices on which they work. They rarely know one another's offline identities. That means they rarely know who among them may already have become a turncoat.
Last week, federal authorities announced that a notorious hacker who went by the nickname Sabu and spoke on behalf of an Anonymous offshoot called LulzSec had been cooperating with law enforcement for six months. Several of his suspected accomplices were indicted in federal court in Manhattan.
That Anonymous can metastasize and spread is arguably at the core of its success. Its critics also see in it a kernel of their downfall.
''Anonymous has given birth to something that will either implode on itself and that will be that,'' Ms. Landesman said, or, she added, in the same breath, ''I don't know.''

HEADLINE: Guard Those Gutters

BYLINE: By JILL P. CAPUZZO

 BODY:
WHEN Helen Brontzman went outside her house in Haddonfield one recent morning to retrieve her newspaper, she noticed an unfamiliar hole in her garden. Looking up, she saw that the 20-foot-long copper downspout previously attached to her two-story brick colonial had been stolen. The following week, her neighbor across the street suffered a similar theft, as did a third near neighbor, an elderly woman.
''They're very adept at what they do,'' said Ms. Brontzman, 67, of the copper gutter thieves. ''They lift the spouts off the teeth that hold them up vertically, stomp them down flat, fold them up in an accordion pleat and off they go.'' 
Though no arrests have been made, John Banning, Haddonfield's police chief, said that things had quieted down lately, after a spate of copper thefts in the Camden County town in the fall and early winter. A police e-mail blast may have helped, as it increased vigilance on the part of residents. Describing copper as ''the new gold,'' the police bulletin suggested that residents trim back bushes surrounding their houses, install motion detection lighting and, as a last resort, disguise their copper gutters by painting them black.
Such thefts, which used to predominate in poor city neighborhoods with older commercial and public buildings, are occurring with greater frequency in upscale residential neighborhoods in towns like Haddonfield. As the economy continues to limp toward recovery, and some forms of scrap copper sell for more than $3 a pound, thieves are cashing in on stolen copper gutters, copper faucets and piping, copper wiring, even air-conditioning units with copper coils.
In Fair Haven in November, the police tracked down a suspicious vehicle ''filled to the gills with folded copper,'' including gutters from a large riverfront house, according to Jesse Dykstra, a detective. The cache led officers to a man who worked as a gutter installer. The police in Deal, Mantoloking and Spring Lake are trying to connect him to similar cases in their towns. ''This guy essentially did the work on the houses, and then went and took the work that he did,'' Detective Dykstra said. ''Sort of like double-dipping.''
But the thefts have also proliferated in neighborhoods with a large number of foreclosed houses, which are easy prey when left empty. Andrew White, a detective in Passaic, said that more than a dozen homes and businesses there had been struck since the beginning of the year, with burglars cutting out copper pipes and faucets. In one incident last month, in which the police made an arrest, the suspect had cut pipes in a house where the water system was still on, causing extensive flooding, Detective White said.
The police have warned homeowners to secure their basement doors and check up on empty properties frequently. Absentee owners are especially vulnerable, as they may have less recourse to insurance reimbursement. Theft is covered in all homeowner insurance policies, but most have a clause stipulating that a home left vacant for more than 30 days may not receive full coverage.
Targets in addition to buildings have included infrastructure equipment like train signal boxes and streetlights. In the last year, thefts of train signal wiring have caused delays in New Jersey Transit lines, while thefts from 200 lampposts in Camden have left neighborhoods in the dark. Also, metal grave markers and flower urns were stolen from six cemeteries in Burlington and Camden Counties.
To curtail the rash of thefts, legislation recently introduced in the New Jersey Assembly seeks to crack down on the metal yards that buy salvaged materials. Modeled on bills passed in several other states, New Jersey's proposed laws would require dealers to document and photograph all transactions, not just those exceeding 100 pounds or $50, as is now the rule. They would also impose a five-day waiting period before dealers could sell any newly acquired scrap. Assemblywoman Celeste M. Riley, a sponsor of the bill, said she hoped it would slow down the trend, which she said had been ''just awful in the last year.''
''While they might be able to get the metal,'' she said of scrap thieves, ''they won't have a place to so easily make money from it.''
Tom Buechel, the owner of Rockaway Recycling in Morris County, said his company already required identification and a signed release form from all sellers, and photographed all purchases. A member of the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, a national trade organization that reports metal thefts on its Web site scraptheftalert.com, Mr. Buechel says he contacts the police if a suspicious shipment of scrap metal comes in. That said, he feels the proposal -- especially the five-day waiting period -- would hurt scrap yards.
''My guys are here to separate and process what comes in,'' he said, ''and it would be really hard to hold everyone's scrap in separate bins. Scrap yards are not the bad guys. We're the victims of who's stealing.'' Homeowners like Ms. Brontzman may be more accurately described as the victims. But while it cost her $1,000 to replace the copper downspout, her experience provided a lesson for others, like her nephew Bill Tourtellotte, who after hearing of the theft added more brackets and an alarm system to safeguard his gutters.
''I've been sort of sleeping with one eye open,'' said Mr. Tourtellotte, who is also president of the Haddonfield Civic Association. ''The thought of someone coming onto my property and yanking something off my house -- it's really very unsettling.''

HEADLINE: The Possibility of an Island

BYLINE: By JIM LEWIS

 BODY:
''You want to know why I am the way I am?'' Zita Cobb asked. She's a slender woman in her early 50s, with close cropped hair that gives her a certain iron-pixie mien. She has the distinct composure one often finds in people who've done well in the business world, brisk good humor layered over a fierce intensity. She was speaking in her office in a small building on Fogo Island, a freckle of land that lies off the northeast corner of Newfoundland, Canada, with a population of 2,700 or so scattered across a series of fishing communities with names like Seldom, Joe Batt's Arm and Tilting. It's a place so singular and remote that it has its own peculiar time zone, 1.5 hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time -- though in truth it feels like it's hundreds of years behind: when it's 10 p.m. in New York, it's 1825 on Fogo Island. 
Cobb was born here. ''When I was 5, I had TB,'' she says. ''We didn't have a hospital, but the Christmas Seal boat came around, everybody lined up on the dock, and you got a chest X-ray. So I had to go away for a year, and I was in a sanatorium. For that whole year I never saw anyone in my family. I think I came out of that fully independent. When my father came to get me I remember looking at this man and thinking, 'Who the frick is that?' ''
He was a fisherman, as were most of the people on Fogo Island at the time, and the world he brought her back to was astounding in its seclusion. Overhead there were astronauts orbiting the earth. On the island, there was no electricity, no telephones or radios. Her parents, who could neither read nor write, raised her and her six brothers in a 900-square-foot house, where they'd pursued a life of semi-subsistence virtually identical to their forebears. No land deeds, no bank accounts, for that matter no cash: they sold their fish to merchants for credit in a company store, and everything else they needed they made themselves. Cobb showed me a picture of her mother as a girl, taken some time in the early 1940s. ''I really don't think that they knew there was a war on,'' she said. ''How would they know?'' Her ancestors had arrived straight from Ireland and England and started fishing.
Newfoundlanders call these minuscule fishing villages ''outports,'' which gives them an apt air of edge-of-the-known. Getting to Fogo Island still isn't easy; it typically entails several flights, a 60-mile drive, a 45-minute ferry and then another drive. Staying there is an exercise in anachronism. There are no fast food outlets on the island, only one bank, no movie theaters or malls, and if there was a neon sign anywhere I didn't see it. The houses all face the North Atlantic, cold and seemingly endless. Circling around the island's many bays and inlets (it's about 4 times the size of Manhattan, with about 50 miles of paved road), one grows used to looking at the picture-book little towns from across a half mile or so of water. On clear days the light bounces freely across the distance, and the buildings appear so sharply etched you'd think you could reach out and touch them. When the clouds come in, everything seems to dissolve into mist and vapors. In spring, spectacular blue-white icebergs drift lazily past the harbors, occasionally letting out growls and groans as they calve.
Time is different; history foreshortened. Irish and English accents still poke up through local speech (''Would you like some oiwce, dere, Jim?'' a local man said to me. Some what? ''Some oiwce. From de oiwceberg.'') Anglican and Catholic and a few other houses of worship dominate the landscape; directions invariably begin with, ''Well, you go down to the church. . . .'' The small graveyards scattered around are full of surnames you recognize: the man who owns your B&B, the girl who works in a local restaurant. It's a land out of time, or it was, until time took it back in, and a single edict devastated the place as swiftly and completely as Katrina devastated New Orleans. The outports were based on the cod industry, but the cod were disappearing, so in 1992 the Canadian government declared a moratorium on fishing, and just like that, Fogo Island, and hundreds of outports just like it, simply collapsed.
By then, Cobb had left the island to get an undergraduate business degree in Ottawa; she'd worked for an oil company in Alberta, then for a firm that specialized in cold-weather engineering. In 1988, she quit and spent six months traveling through Africa; the next year, she joined the fiber optics company JDS Fitel (JDS merged with the American company Uniphase), and in time she was promoted to C.F.O. By 2000, she was the third-highest-paid female executive on American payrolls; in 2002, the year she cashed out, she made about four times as much as she'd made in 2000. She spent several years sailing around the world, and eventually made her way back, as many native sons and daughters do, to Fogo Island: one of the richest women in Canada, returning to one of its poorest communities.
Her plan was simply to take a break from her travels, but she returned to an island that had fallen into desuetude. Her first response was to set up a few scholarships, but one night she was buttonholed by a local mother. (Fogo Island women are nothing if not direct.) ''Oh, it's all really fine what you're doing,'' the woman said. ''But you do realize that you're just paying our children to leave, don't you? You look smart enough. Can't you do something to make jobs?''
It's a simple question that people are grappling with in small towns everywhere, from the Gulf Coast to Nebraska. ''Rural renewal'' is a far less common term than its urban counterpart, but the problem is just as pressing, and in many ways similar: a community with vivid traditions and a struggling population gets hit by a disaster -- economic, natural, political or all three -- and has to decide how to recreate itself without becoming soulless and bland. Fogo Island has a curious advantage. It's historically and geographically isolated; its population is small, homogeneous and for the most part fixed; its economy is simple; and Cobb had the resources to make an open-ended financial commitment. There are few variables to control for, no wild cards to keep at bay. All she had to do was invert the old maxim: Teach them not to fish, and she'd feed them for a lifetime.
So she went C.F.O. on the place. She set up a foundation with her brother Tony called Shorefast (the name comes from a line used to fix cod traps to the shore), putting up millions of her own money and getting matching grants from various Canadian agencies; she started thinking and planning. The morning after I arrived on the island, she gave me a presentation: there was a section on the island's berries; maps, quotes, photographs, invocations and exhortations; brief histories of cod fishing, of local cuisine, quilting and boat-building; descriptions of microfinance initiatives, and topping it all off, a project consisting of six art studios, scattered around the island, along with a smart new hotel to house visitors. Cobb had cataloged all the local knowledge she could find, and used it to build a complex array of projects: restaurants, a library, furniture, boat races, oceanic studies, astronomy, theater, art galleries.
There seems to be little she hasn't thought of. Consider, for example, the punts: small wooden rowboats that once dotted the harbor. One day, Cobb's brother pointed out to her that there were only a handful of people on the island who still knew how to build them, and they were getting along in years. ''Do you realize we're eight funerals away from never being able to build another punt on Fogo Island?'' he said. So Tony set up a punt-building program and, to keep the effort from becoming irrelevant, established a yearly race between Fogo Island and nearby Change Islands, a solution both ingenious and extremely popular.
Whether the rest of her plans will prove as effective remains to be seen. As it stands, the project is in medias res: four of the six studios have been built, and the Inn itself should be finished by November.
All of them were designed by Todd Saunders, an up-and-coming architect who's as close to local as it's possible to get. Born and raised in Gander, the nearest town with an airport, he now lives in Norway. But like so many Newfoundlanders, what he wanted most was an excuse to go back home. When Cobb first contacted him, on his cellphone as he was kayaking in a fjord, he said he blurted out, ''I was waiting for this call. ''
It was an unusual commission. ''I had to make modern architecture the way a Newfoundlander would,'' Saunders said. ''Scandinavian design has a refinement to it, but Tilting's got this ugly beauty.'' To an outsider, Tilting, like the other towns, is more jolie than laide, but it has simplicity and consistency. If there's been any new residential construction on the island in a century, you wouldn't know it, and the buildings that exist look much like what you'd get if you asked a 6-year-old to draw a house. The greatest risk for an architect who wants to build there is, well, architecture: a structure that seems too designed would have looked silly, at best, and insulting at worst. On this count, the studios are very well done indeed: they're small, rough-hewn buildings, almost as simple as their neighbors but with forms and touches that keep them from seeming pious or perfunctory. The two-story Tower Studio, a vertical building at the end of a narrow boardwalk, has twists in it that makes it refractory, like a jewel made out of wood; the Bridge Studio looks like someone broke off a piece of a SoHo loft and fixed it on a hillside; and the Squish Studio, which sits on a rocky promontory, has a view so dominated by water that it feels like a wheelhouse.
The Inn is the largest of Saunders's projects, and perhaps most difficult to get right. When it's done, it will contain more than 40,000 square feet of floor space, spread over four stories -- considerably larger than any other building on the island. There'll be 29 rooms with floor-to-ceiling windows, nested on top of various public spaces, all gathered in a subtly X-shaped building that sits on a promontory outside of Joe Batt's Arm. So far, it's cost $20 million -- probably as much as it would cost to buy every other building on the island -- and when it's done it will belong to Shorefast. Whether it will dwarf the community or crown it is hard to say; Cobb herself makes nervous jokes about its size, but it's bound to be a spectacular place to stay.
The Inn will bring the tourists, and most of the money, but according to Cobb, art is the key to Fogo's reinvention, not because it comes with cash, but because it comes with consciousness, with communal self-knowledge and a sense of possibility. Accordingly, the studios are scattered around the island; the idea is not for artists to mix with each other, but to place them in the towns and see what happens. With little feel for art herself, Cobb hired Elisabet Gunnarsdottir, an Icelandic woman with a background in design and arts administration, to set up a semi-autonomous organization called the Fogo Island Arts Corporation. ''This place was dying, really,'' Gunnarsdottir told me. ''But one of the things I love about this project is that this is not us coming in as saviors: 'Here we are, we know it all, listen to us.' We have to create something new, modern, for the future. But how do we do it so that there's a continuation, there's a link with the past?''
If you ask the islanders what, in fact, they want and expect, you get a host of contradictory answers. Like Newfoundlanders in general, they're at once proud, somewhat inward and unusually welcoming of visitors.
And they're profoundly attached to the place, if frustrated by its penury. The result is something like the Amish rumspringa: young people often leave, usually to work in Alberta, but a surprising number end up coming back.
That sort of push-me-pull-you attitude extends deep into the culture. One woman I spoke to spent the first half of our conversation expressing her reservations about outsiders moving onto the island, if only because it meant things were going to be different, and the second half bemoaning the fact that if she wanted to stop by a Wal-Mart to pick up some basic goods, she had to take the ferry to the mainland. Did she want a Wal-Mart on the island, then? Of course not, she said. But when I pointed out the contradiction -- she didn't want the world coming to her, but she was tired of having to go meet the world -- she changed the subject.
Few people I talked to were willing to come out and say that they have any problem with Cobb's plans. But they'll readily report that other people do. Some people, one hears, ask why she brought quilting experts from off the island to hold a class, when they know perfectly well how to quilt, and have for centuries. Some people complain that the price of housing has already gone up considerably, and this in a community so closely held that people only recently got deeds to their properties. Some people are irked that she hasn't built, say, a swimming pool instead of all those artists' studios. After all, the studios aren't for the locals, and in the meantime there's no place for children to learn how to swim.
Cobb has worries of her own: the possibility that Fogo Islanders would become too dependent upon her; that somehow she was tampering with the scale of the place; that there was so much these people -- her people -- had to learn about getting by in the modern world, and so little time for them to learn it; that the project would fail altogether, or succeed too well and become overrun by tourists. She was worried that she wouldn't live to see her work on its feet -- her parents and two of her brothers died young. ''I come from a family of people who don't live very long,'' she pointed out. Above all, she was worried about doing right by the place. ''If this goes bad, I'm going to have a bad life,'' she told me. ''You know that graveyard I showed you last night? My parents would get out of that and wring my neck.'' She was quite serious about the first remark. I half suspected she believed the second one, too.
It's too soon to tell, but I think her folks are going to be able to rest in peace. One evening I attended an impromptu song swap in a church in Joe Batt's Arm. There were about 50 people there, among them several Norwegian performers and some theater students from Canada's National Arts Center, all of whom were on the island for an Ibsen festival. About a dozen people got up to sing, mostly folk songs from wherever they were from. Cobb sat in the circle alongside three local women, slouching a bit and looking effectively anonymous, even when her turn came to join her partners in an old Fogo Island song. It was a backward-looking performance in a forward-looking environment, and everyone enjoyed it. Reflecting on it afterward, I was reminded of something Cobb had dropped into one of our first conversations, a remark that she got from Giuseppe di Lampedusa's ''The Leopard.'' If she can convince her fellow islanders of its truth, she has a good shot at accomplishing everything she's working for. ''If you want things to stay the same,'' she'd said, ''they have to change.''
ESSENTIALS Fogo Island
Fogo Island remains isolated and, at least until the Inn opens this November, short on amenities. To get there fly into Gander, Newfoundland, rent a car, and then drive 60 or so miles to Farewell to catch the ferry, which leaves every 4 hours or so (though if your flight gets in very late, as many do, you'll have to spend the night in Gander). Once on the island, there are four or five B&B's, including Foley's, which was quite nice. For lunch and dinner, Nicole's Cafe in Joe Batt's Arm is the place. You may find yourself eating there twice a day for the entirety of your stay, though their affiliated ice cream shop, Growler's, is just down the road, and serves soup and sandwiches in the winter. There's also a curious Chinese restaurant called Kwang Tung in the town of Fogo (on Garrison Road). The Town of Fogo Island's Web site has several useful links. For information on events on the island, check Shorefast's Web site, or that of the Arts Corporation.

HEADLINE: 63 Years Flying, From Glamour to Days of Gray

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
DENVER -- As the crush of passengers boarded United Flight 618 to Hawaii here last month, they passed by a silver-haired flight attendant in bifocals who greeted them with an ''Aloha, welcome aboard.''
Most of them appeared more focused on finding their seats than sizing up the flight crew, but this flight attendant, Ron Akana, stood out, not least because of the 11 sparkling rhinestones on the wings pinned to his lapel. The first one was to commemorate his 10-year anniversary as a flight attendant, and he was given another for every subsequent five years of flying.
Yes, Mr. Akana has worked as a flight attendant for 63 years, clocking some 20 million miles along the way, the equivalent of circling the globe about 800 times or flying roughly 40 times to the moon and back. Though no one tracks seniority across all airlines, he is widely believed to hold the title of longest-serving flight attendant in the United States.
''People keep on telling me to apply to the Guinness Book of Records,'' he said. ''I'll let somebody else do that.'' 
Mr. Akana, 83, has just about seen it all. In his early years, impeccably dressed passengers were served seafood salad and congregated at the cocktail bar on board. But he is also the face of a profession that has gone from glamorous to gray, as more flight attendants work longer than they ever imagined.
More than 40 percent of the roughly 110,000 flight attendants in the United States are 50 or older, according to an analysis of 2010 census data by Rogelio Saenz, a sociologist at the University of Texas, San Antonio, who has studied the changing demographics of flight attendants. Less than 18 percent are 34 or younger.
While the overall American work force has aged because of demographic shifts, the ranks of flight attendants have aged faster as they have held on to their jobs.
After all, seniority pays off for flight attendants, because the longest-serving ones get first dibs on flying schedules, and typically choose long-haul routes that fill up their required hours each month much faster than short hops. With a battered airline industry instituting furloughs and pay cuts, many workers have delayed their retirement plans.
Mr. Akana cannot lay claim to all bragging rights -- he is not the oldest working flight attendant in the United States, for example. By many accounts, that distinction belongs to 87-year-old Robert Reardon of Delta Airlines. Mr. Reardon began his career flying for Northwest in 1951, two years after Mr. Akana took to the skies as one of the first male ''stewards'' hired by United in 1949 for flights between the mainland and Hawaii.
Mr. Akana has held the No. 1 spot at United for the past five years, since Iris Peterson retired after 60 years of service at the age of 85.
While many of his older colleagues are still flying because they have to, Mr. Akana said he does not work for the paycheck alone. At one time, just after he turned 70, Mr. Akana was among the highest-paid flight attendants at the airline, earning $106,000 a year through a combination of pay, pension and Social Security -- a situation that has earned him a ''triple dipper'' label by younger colleagues and airline bookkeepers.
''When I fly, it's vacation money,'' Mr. Akana likes to joke. But after flying for so many years, the idea of hanging up his sparkling wings is hard for him to fathom. He added that he would miss the people he works with, the passengers he meets and the routine he goes through for every trip, laying out his uniform and packing the night before.
''I just always felt that it's just too much a part of my life,'' he said.
Decades ago, hiring policies ensured that the ranks of flight attendants remained young. Stewardesses faced mandatory retirement by 32. If they married or became pregnant, they were out. In 1966, a New York Times classified ad for stewardesses at Eastern Airlines listed these requirements: ''A high school graduate, single (widows and divorcees with no children considered), 20 years of age (girls 19 1/2 may apply for future consideration). 5'2'' but no more than 5'9,'' weight 105 to 135 in proportion to height and have at least 20/40 vision without glasses.''
Stewards like Mr. Akana were not subject to quite as strict regulations. In 1963, he married a fellow flight attendant, Elizabeth Ann Ebersole. They met on Waikiki Beach six months earlier when a colleague played matchmaker. He continued to fly. She promptly quit.
''In those days, you had to,'' she said. ''There was no way I could be sneaky about it.''
The next year, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed into law, but it was not until years later, after numerous lawsuits against airlines' discriminatory practices, that such rules fell away and what had been a transient job for primarily young women turned into a longtime career. Mr. Akana's daughter, Jean, born that same year, is now a 22-year veteran flight attendant for United.
Her colleagues will not let her forget that she has a father who is famous at United. ''The minute they hear my name, they go, 'Wait, are you related to that Ron?' '' she said.
As No. 1 on the list at newly merged United-Continental, Mr. Akana always gets the schedule he wants. Lately that means three three-day trips a month from Denver to Kauai or Maui. He spends one night on the island, squeezing in lunch with old friends or perhaps a round of golf before heading back home to Boulder, Colo.
He has the rest of the month off, giving him time to work on his golf game, hop in his RV to visit a national park with his wife or take advantage of his United travel benefits to fly someplace new if seats are available.
Over the years Mr. Akana has taken his wife and two children all over the world free, including vacations to Australia, New Zealand, Europe and Hong Kong. There were also weekend jaunts to Chicago so the children could try deep-dish pizza.
Mr. Akana was a fresh-faced 21-year-old when he -- along with 400 others -- applied in 1949 for one of eight steward positions United wanted to fill to represent each of the eight major Hawaiian Islands.
''For a local Hawaiian boy, it was so exciting to get to the mainland,'' said Mr. Akana, who was born and raised in Honolulu. ''I looked around and thought, 'I'll never get this job.' There were 400 other guys; half of them had coats and ties. All I had was an aloha shirt.''
But after the first cut, he began calling the hiring manager weekly to check in. His persistence paid off, and he was soon taking off on his first flight to the mainland.
Back then, the Boeing Stratocruiser, a long-range propeller plane powered by four piston engines, was state of the art, making the trip between the islands and the mainland in about 10 hours, roughly double the time it takes today.
Seats were all first class, with four bunk beds up front and a private stateroom in the back with its own beds and bathroom. A circular staircase led to a lower-deck cocktail lounge, and flight attendants prepared hot meals for the 52 to 54 people on board.
Passengers dressed up to fly. ''All the men had suits and ties on. The ladies were always showcases of fashion,'' Mr. Akana recalled. ''There was no such thing as walking on a plane with slippers.''
Celebrity sightings were common, too. ''I brought the whole cast of 'From Here to Eternity' to Hawaii,'' he said, rattling off the list of stars that included Burt Lancaster, Frank Sinatra, Montgomery Clift and Deborah Kerr. ''I made her bed in the stateroom. That was exciting,'' he added. ''Burt Lancaster had 12 or 13 martinis, then came and bartended with me as if he hadn't had one.''
Bill Clinton, Bing Crosby, Sammy Davis Jr. and Red Skelton were among the notable passengers he has served. Mr. Skelton, sitting in the seat next to where Mr. Akana delivered the life vest demonstration, mimicked the entire routine. ''It was hard enough for me to project my voice throughout the whole cabin without this guy, with his cigar unlit of course, carrying on. Oh, it was just so much fun,'' Mr. Akana said, grinning from ear to ear.
It was not all enchanting, of course. In the early days, Mr. Akana recalls, cigarette smoke filled the cabin as passengers lighted up after takeoff. And between flights, the aircraft was sprayed with pesticide while flight attendants were still on board. He has lived through decades of deregulation and the turbulent industry economics, including bankruptcies and cuts that stripped flights of most services.
As a result, he said, the job has fundamentally changed and service is no longer as important as it was when he started 63 years ago. ''The focus is more on the safety things that you have to know, which is what we claim is the most important thing,'' he said on a recent morning on the way to the airport.
All along Mr. Akana has remained a loyal company man, but he is beginning to think about retirement. After so many years of flying, he and his wife want to see the country by RV and perhaps take a cruise.
Mr. Akana acknowledges that he is starting to slow down a bit. ''We get an average of four or five wheelchairs a trip,'' said Mr. Akana, who underwent knee replacement surgery last year. ''I know our bones fail; I'm beginning to feel it myself. Most of the people I help, I'm older than them.''

HEADLINE: Lessons on Vice, Liberties and the Law

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Last weekend in Missouri, Rick Santorum, proclaiming his commitment to those places not on the coasts, took an opportunity to denigrate New York City, reviving a conservative meme that casts urbanism as the sinful twin of a mythic and decent real America. Anyone seeking further evidence of the candidate's Victorian orientation could find it in this particular strain of cultural partisanship, which imagines cities not as they now are but as they once were, long ago -- squalid places ripe for moral renewal. 
Those on the right rarely seem to appreciate how wholesome and familial the city has become. It is as if all the tour buses and cupcakes and skating rinks that challenge the patience of the natives have failed to catch notice. Liberals of a certain kind, though, are too often heard lamenting a lost authenticity -- the vanishing of a drug-addled, peepshow Manhattan that they were, in so many instances, too young or cosseted to inhabit. The nostalgist is typically moved to glorify the 1970s -- the New York of ''Annie Hall,'' and ''Mean Streets,'' of peril and florid decline. But it is an infatuation with a period beyond memory and apprehension -- far dirtier in every conceivable respect -- that animates ''Island of Vice,'' Richard Zacks's new book chronicling the brief, doomed tenure of Theodore Roosevelt as president of the board of the city's police commissioners.
Roosevelt served as police chief from 1895 to 1897 and brought with him a patrician distaste for the undisciplined habits of the masses. Above all, he made it his mission to take on the city's licentious culture. At the time, New York, which did not yet encompass the five boroughs, claimed 8,000 saloons. By way of comparison, according to the New York State Liquor Authority, the city today, vastly larger in acreage and five and a half times as populous, claims just over 10,000 bars.
Forty years before Bill Wilson would help develop Alcoholics Anonymous in his Brooklyn Heights town house, drinking was prodigious at every level of society -- from the beer halls in the immigrant quarters of the Lower East Side to the clubs and moneyed nightlife farther uptown. The book recounts the details of a party attended by Stanford White and the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens at which 144 bottles of Champagne were consumed by 33 people, before a near-naked 16-year-old girl emerged from an enormous pie. Purchasable sex was ubiquitous; prostitution was an occupation practiced by 40,000 women in New York during the 1890s, and many of those women were, in fact, girls.
''Island of Vice'' offers little indication that Roosevelt was especially bothered by the child-endangerment dimensions of the city's sexual mechanics. It was the sex in general that seemed to addle him, as well as the graft and corruption to which the presence of so many brothels gave rise.
The book is a straightforward narrative history that doesn't try to forge any wider social arguments, but virtually no interpolation is required to read it as a warning against the dangers of legislating and enforcing certain types of personal morality.
The Bloomberg administration might have done well to study the prejudicial policing deployed by Roosevelt's force, if only to learn from its lunacy. Roosevelt embarked on his version of stop-and-frisk tactics by having patrolmen turn their attention to women unaccompanied on the street at night on the assumption that they were selling themselves. Mocking the routine, one paper at the time noted that sooner or later the Statue of Liberty would have to be arrested. Less insidiously, but with no less a showcasing of his micromanaging impulse, Roosevelt demanded the enforcement of laws requiring up to a $5 fine and 10 days in jail for littering with fruits and vegetables. He probably would have worked to create laws against squeegee men had there been cars, and he set the imprimatur for the current mayoral mood, in which the appetites for salt, soda and cigarettes have been made targets.
Roosevelt's stewardship highlights the limits of broken-windows policing, the theory established nearly a century later by James Q. Wilson, who died this month. While certain types of civilian complaints were reduced and quality of life improved during Roosevelt's tenure, there is no evidence of a clear drop in crime. Gambling, imbibing and prostitution continued to flourish despite crackdowns and blue laws, demonstrating that theatrical displays of moral concern can run counterproductive to the goals of policy.
His critics accused him of depriving peace-minded citizens of their liberties, of prizing arrests to the point that false ones were made. Roosevelt lost support and made enemies, but was rescued by Washington before a likely ouster. President McKinley named him assistant secretary of the Navy in 1897, and when McKinley was assassinated a few years later, Roosevelt became the country's youngest president.
''You can do an infinite amount of vice enforcement but not end vice,'' Mark Kleiman, a public policy professor who has written extensively on drug policy and criminal justice, told me. The crack epidemic in New York subsided, Professor Kleiman has argued, not because of anti-drug campaigns, but because the economics of the business weren't favorable. Crack dealing was low-wage work. ''With vice enforcement,'' he said, ''you are mostly shoving sand against the tide.''

HEADLINE: Why Some Countries Go Bust

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
By his own admission, Daron Acemoglu is a slightly pudgy and fairly nerdy guy with an unpronounceable last name. But when I mentioned that I was interviewing him to two econ buffs, they each gasped and said, ''I love Daron Acemoglu,'' as if I were talking about Keith Richards. The Turkish M.I.T. professor -- who, right now, is about as hot as economists get -- acquired his renown for serious advances in answering the single most important question in his profession, the same one that compelled Adam Smith to write ''The Wealth of Nations'': why are some countries rich while others are poor?
Over the centuries, proposed answers have varied greatly. Smith declared that the difference between wealth and poverty resulted from the relative freedom of the markets; Thomas Malthus said poverty comes from overpopulation; and John Maynard Keynes claimed it was a byproduct of a lack of technocrats. (Of course, everyone knows that politicians love listening to wonky bureaucrats!) Jeffrey Sachs, one of the world's most famous economists, asserts that poor soil, lack of navigable rivers and tropical diseases are, in part, to blame. Others point to culture, geography, climate, colonization and military might. The list goes on. 
But through a series of legendary -- and somewhat controversial -- academic papers published over the past decade, Acemoglu has persuasively challenged many of the previous theories. (If poverty were primarily the result of geography, say, or an unfortunate history, how can we account for the successes of Botswana, Costa Rica or Thailand?) Now, in their new book, ''Why Nations Fail,'' Acemoglu and his collaborator, James Robinson, argue that the wealth of a country is most closely correlated with the degree to which the average person shares in the overall growth of its economy. It's an idea that was first raised by Smith but was then largely ignored for centuries as economics became focused on theoretical models of ideal economies rather than the not-at-all-ideal problems of real nations.
Consider Acemoglu's idea from the perspective of a poor farmer. In parts of modern sub-Saharan Africa, as was true in medieval Europe or the antebellum South, the people who work the fields lack any incentive to improve their yield because any surplus is taken by the wealthy elite. This mind-set changes only when farmers are given strong property rights and discover that they can profit from extra production. In 1978, China began allowing farmers to benefit from any surplus they produced. The decision, most economists agree, helped spark the country's astounding growth.
According to Acemoglu's thesis, when a nation's institutions prevent the poor from profiting from their work, no amount of disease eradication, good economic advice or foreign aid seems to help. I observed this firsthand when I visited a group of Haitian mango farmers a few years ago. Each farmer had no more than one or two mango trees, even though their land lay along a river that could irrigate their fields and support hundreds of trees. So why didn't they install irrigation pipes? Were they ignorant, indifferent? In fact, they were quite savvy and lived in a region teeming with well-intended foreign-aid programs. But these farmers also knew that nobody in their village had clear title to the land they farmed. If they suddenly grew a few hundred mango trees, it was likely that a well-connected member of the elite would show up and claim their land and its spoils. What was the point?
I encountered another side of Acemoglu's thesis during what must have been one of history's great natural economic experiments: post-Saddam Hussein Baghdad. On April 9, 2003, the day the city was captured, one of the world's most tightly controlled economies suddenly became a free-for-all. Amid the chaos, many former state functionaries turned into entrepreneurs. Nearly every engineer from the ministry of housing, it seemed, had opened his own construction company. Satellite TVs, once illegal to all but a very small elite, were sold on every major street. Under Hussein, only one company (widely rumored to be monitored by the intelligence service) offered Internet access, and it was incredibly bad and expensive. After it was gone, there were so many new Internet companies that I had far more access options then than I do today in Brooklyn.
Yet the American authorities, who had not planned for this budding free market, all but destroyed it when they gave the bulk of new contracts to large companies outside the country. Often, these outsiders subcontracted to Iraqi firms with close ties to the state's new political establishment. By the anniversary of the United States invasion, it was clear that economic success would again come from connections and corruption rather than talent and hard work. Today, Transparency International ranks Iraq as one of the most corrupt nations on earth. An Iraqi friend once told me that he had hoped we would teach the Iraqis how to be Americans. Instead, the Americans learned how to be Iraqi.
Acemoglu, Robinson and their collaborators did not come up with the idea that incentives matter, of course, nor the notion that politics play a role in economic development. Their great contribution has been a series of clever historical studies that persuasively argue that the cheesiest of slogans is actually correct: the true value of a nation is its people. If national institutions give even their poorest and least educated citizens some shot at improving their own lives -- through property rights, a reliable judicial system or access to markets -- those citizens will do what it takes to make themselves and their country richer. This suggests, among other things, that instead of supporting one-off programs promoting health or agricultural productivity, the international community should focus its aid efforts on deep political and economic change.
Perhaps just as interesting, ''Why Nations Fail'' also shows the effects of different economic and political systems over the centuries. The sections on ancient Rome and medieval Venice are particularly compelling, because they show how fairly open and prosperous societies can revert to closed and impoverished autocracies. It's hard to read these sections without thinking about the present-day United States, where economic inequality has grown substantially over the past few decades. Is the 1 percent emerging as a wealth-stripping, poverty-inducing elite?
Well, maybe. Acemoglu and Robinson's frequent collaborator Simon Johnson, the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, told me that financial firms have so thoroughly co-opted the political proc/ess that the American economy has become fundamentally unsound. ''It's bad and getting worse,'' he told me. Barring some major shift in our political system, he suggested, the United States could be on its way to serious economic failure.
Charles Calomiris, an economist at Columbia University, is less worried. But it's not because he thinks that banks haven't co-opted our political system. ''We've never had a good banking system,'' he says. ''What's amazing about America is that we've been the most successful economy in the world while being crippled by political constraints on the quality of our banking system.'' This has been going on since the 1700s, Calomiris says, and he doesn't see any reason for the United States' economy to stop growing anytime soon.
Acemoglu and Robinson are on the pessimistic side of optimism about the United States' chances of a resurgence. Congress, they told me, is too heavily influenced by the wealthy, and the advent of super PACs has only given elites more power. Yet Acemoglu surprised me when he said he was encouraged by the rise of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street. While neither has an especially coherent or subtle economic agenda, both show that, however frustrated they might be, large numbers of Americans still believe they can influence the political process to improve their fortunes. Since the future of American economic health lies in its people, Acemoglu explained, as long as Americans believe they can influence the process, they will.
But, he quickly pointed out, what if Americans find their protests have no impact? What if the United States becomes a truly extractive nation, with violent repression of protest or -- in some ways, worse -- the grudging acquiescence of the beaten-down masses? While many Americans are frustrated by the divisive, often angry public debates over our economic future, we may only be in real trouble at the very moment that they shut up.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. For centuries, economists have been trying to figure out why nations fail.
2. A hot new theory blames the elites.
3. If it's true, is the 99 percent doomed?

HEADLINE: Trying to Catch Runaway Tuition

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The solution to the problem of soaring tuition (''The Prestige Chase Is Raising College Costs,'' Economic View, March 11) lies right under the noses of many institutions of higher learning: the college endowment fund. 
Many colleges maintain endowments with billions in assets. If they applied the annual earnings or a small fraction of principal toward student financial relief, they could greatly reduce their students' burden.
These are tax-exempt organizations, but why? The funds' managers know far more about stock picking, real estate investing and commodity speculation than about a university's curriculum or its student-body needs.
The government should threaten to revoke the exemption of any college endowment fund that does not apply at least its annual gains to reduce tuition levels and other student costs. At high-end universities, with the most billions in their endowments, maybe the Internal Revenue Service should demand a justification as to why students have to pay anything at all.

To the Editor:
Although private colleges charge the highest tuition, it's public institutions that educate the most students. At these institutions, the rise in tuition is correlated with state legislative disinvestment in higher education.
But as tuition has climbed, middle-class family income has stagnated. As a result, the burden of tuition increases has shifted to middle-class students and their families, who can ill afford it.
In many public universities, part-time faculty and graduate assistants are replacing full-time faculty members in classrooms. The replacements receive less pay, and many get no retirement and health insurance benefits. Unfortunately, the trend away from full-time faculty will probably increase in response to President Obama's ill-thought-through proposal that colleges reduce tuition or face the loss of federal funds.

HEADLINE: Is This Our First Gay Senator?

BYLINE: By ANDREW GOLDMAN

 BODY:
When writing about your Senate campaign in Wisconsin, the press consistently refers to you as the ''first out lesbian'' elected to Congress. Are we to assume that Congress is full of closeted lesbians? That's never been the way I've construed it. I think it was written in a similar fashion when I was first running for the State Assembly back in 1992. So much attention was focused on whether the electorate was ready, whether this sort of history could be made.
When you were elected to Congress in 1998, there were many people in Madison -- a very liberal college town -- who were energized by the thought of sending a lesbian to Washington. But this election is statewide. There will be voters who think you're going to hell because of whom you love. How do you deal with them? This November, people in Wisconsin will be so focused on getting by. They've made serious adjustments to deal with this economy -- whether it's the recession or the decline of the middle class before then. I feel so strongly that that's what's going to be on people's minds. 
Recent polls suggest that gay marriage is less divisive these days. President Obama famously said his views on gay marriage were ''evolving.'' Would you respect his support on the issue if you thought it was based on an electoral calculation? Look, he is moving in the right direction on this issue. He's been crucial in equality efforts like the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell and signing the Matthew Shepard hate crimes prevention act. I have no idea what goes on in another person's mind. As a legislator, I need to be good at persuading people, counting votes and getting to 50 percent plus one. I don't go back and say, ''Why did this person get to the right position?'' It's only ''Are you yes or are you no?''
You grew up with your grandparents. Where was your mom? She was 19 when I was born, and she was in the middle of a divorce and overwhelmed. My grandparents were there, and I'm very, very grateful. She needed their help.
I understand that she had a prescription drug addiction. That's something I associate more with the 21st century than the 1970s. For many years of her life, she suffered from acute and chronic pain and other conditions. This has been a long, long-term battle for her.
When did you first know you were gay? It became very clear to me in college.
You came out to your family after graduating from Smith. Was it particularly difficult discussing that with your grandparents, who were of a very different generation? Sadly, my grandfather passed away before I came out. I remember speculating with my grandmother about how the conversation would have been if it was with both of them, not that either of us knew. She said something like, ''I certainly hope he would've been supportive, but we don't know.'' And she said, ''I'm here for you.''
Universal health care has long been an issue dear to you, and in the midst of the legislative battle in 2009, you worried that without a public option, we'd be left with ''an expanded version of an already dysfunctional system.'' Many people feel that's exactly what we ended up with. I had a serious childhood illness -- sort of like spinal meningitis -- that led to a three-month hospitalization. Afterward, I couldn't be insured because of a pre-existing condition. Now no child can be denied coverage on that basis. Every single Republican who's running for the Senate in Wisconsin, though, is committed to repealing that and all health care reforms.
You have joined protesters in Madison pushing for the recall of Wisconsin's union-busting governor, Scott Walker. What have your personal interactions with him been like? I never would have predicted in our six years working together in the State Assembly that all of this would have transpired under his governorship. He was always very conservative and a nice guy. There was once a bill we co-sponsored that was signed into law by Gov. Tommy Thompson. It was a campaign-finance and transparency issue that he and I worked across the aisle on. So yes, I feel deceived by this governor, and I know that sentiment is shared by many in my state.

HEADLINE: In Mexico, a Kidnapping Ignored

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MATAMOROS, Mexico -- They have spotted their stolen vehicles at stoplights, driven by the same gunmen who used them to take their entire family captive last July. They have reported the brazen abduction to every branch of Mexican law enforcement, only to be ignored, or directed someplace else.
For the women of the Cazares family who were kidnapped with their families for ransom -- and who are still searching for five missing relatives -- the official response to their horrific ordeal has been even more excruciating than the crime itself. Even now, they say, after months of trying to goad the Mexican authorities into action, they still see criminals they recognize living large here in this border city, as untouchable as kings.
''We're completely impotent,'' said Zynthia Cazares, 30, an American citizen who was among those abducted and whose husband, brother and father are still missing. ''No one will help us.'' 
Six years into a mostly military assault on drug cartels, impunity across much of Mexico has worsened, and justice is harder to find. Criminals in Mexico are less likely to be punished now than even just a few years ago, say current and former government officials and experts who have studied Mexico's ailing judiciary, because the authorities have been overwhelmed by increases in violent crime while corruption, fear and incompetence have continued to keep the justice system weak.
Many areas now veer toward lawlessness: in 14 of Mexico's 31 states, the chance of a crime's leading to trial and sentencing was less than 1 percent in 2010, according to government figures analyzed by a Mexican research institute known as Cidac. And since then, experts say, attempts at reform have stalled as crime and impunity have become cozy partners.
''Crime goes up, diminishing the likelihood of punishment, which causes crime to rise again,'' said Alejandro Hope, a former senior intelligence officer for Mexico. ''And so we go.''
Kidnappings in particular are fueled by this dynamic. Reported abductions have jumped by more than 300 percent since 2005 -- to levels on par with Mexico's kidnapping wave in the late 1990s -- in part, experts say, because criminal gangs have become better organized and freer to commit crimes without being punished.
Some Mexican officials counter that the kidnappings illustrate the desperation that criminal groups find themselves in after years of battling the government. These officials argue that the training programs and increased coordination among the authorities have strengthened the system. But researchers say that kidnappings, which require teams of captors, safe houses and a degree of territorial control, flourish when the state is particularly feeble. Studies also show that kidnappings destroy a city's sense of security and its economy even more than murders do.
The Cazares case is a telling example: 18 family members were taken from three homes in Matamoros over a few hours on the morning of July 9. Their houses and offices are now shuttered, stripped nearly bare by thieves.
Their barbarous calamity has been pieced together through interviews with a half dozen relatives, personal notes, and correspondence with Mexican and American authorities.
Even with some details and names left out for security reasons, the Cazares case shows how border towns like Matamoros -- across from Brownsville, Tex., and with a population of 490,000 -- run according to rules defined less by government than by gangs that exhibit both sophistication and the heedlessness born of committing crimes in a void, when the chances of getting caught can barely be measured.
The case also shows how various levels of the Mexican government pay lip service to helping crime victims, without doing much else.
Even for families with wealth and connections -- the Cazareses' ranks include government contractors and engineers with decades of government service -- Mexican law enforcement is virtually useless.
''It's unacceptable,'' said one of the women of the Cazares family, explaining why her family has chosen to speak out. ''This has to end.''
The Kidnapping
It was not yet 5 a.m. when the gunmen -- at least eight of them, many with the high voices of youth -- suddenly appeared, first in the living room and then the bedrooms, wearing fatigues and black masks.
Their white sneakers suggested they were not the authorities, but they moved quickly as if they had done this before. They rounded everyone up, blindfolding all but a 9-year-old boy and a girl who turned 11 that day. They asked the family patriarch to open the safe, then the gunmen pushed everyone -- including Rodolfo Cazares, 36, a symphony conductor visiting from Germany, and his French wife, Ludivine -- into the family's vehicles.
The women ended up in the back of a Chevy Suburban, covered with a sheet. ''We couldn't believe it,'' said Mrs. Cazares, Rodolfo's wife. ''We were afraid, but we were always hopeful that nothing bad would happen.''
By 7 a.m., the kidnappers had reached the second home. ''Open the door,'' they demanded, guns in hand, as they stood a half block from a private guard booth for the neighborhood. ''We have your brother.''
They collected four more relatives. There was a slight snag in their plan -- a son had escaped, sprinting to the third Cazares home a few blocks away. But in his haste he must have left the door open because minutes later, the kidnappers barged in there, too.
The fatigues they wore over their clothes were gone. A tall man in jeans with the scent of alcohol directed the family from room to room, holding a pistol to the neck of his guide as he assessed what to steal.
The Cazares men -- three middle-aged brothers, one of their sons and a son-in-law -- were kept together. The women and three children, along with an 84-year-old grandfather, found themselves stuck in other vehicles for most of the first day. Their captors drove them around the city for hours.
It was clear that they were not worried about getting caught. They stopped for gas (without paying, the family said) and in their conversations over portable radios, the men talked mainly about avoiding their rivals, the Zetas, a ruthless crime syndicate. The police rarely came up, and no one intervened -- not neighbors who saw the abduction, nor strangers who saw the Cazares women, in their pajamas and shoeless, being moved into a different car on a busy street around midday.
At one point, the women did hear helicopters overhead. ''We hoped they were coming for us,'' said one of the women.
But then the sound faded.
Around nightfall, the kidnappers drove the women to a house where at least 20 men were drinking and smoking marijuana. Gunfire broke out. Some of the blindfolded women were suddenly shoved into another SUV, where -- feeling with their hands -- they discovered they were sitting next to a dead body.
The kidnappers nonetheless tried to keep everyone calm. They said the family was taken by mistake, a claim the Cazareses still believe. ''We're from the Gulf Cartel,'' the men said. ''We're the good guys.''
The bad guys, in the minds of the abductors, were the Zetas, whose members broke from the Gulf Cartel. And by comparison, the Gulf Cartel is supposed to represent a lighter shade of darkness, but experts say that as kidnapping has become more common, brutality has increased. The government's focus on killing or detaining cartel leaders has led younger, more violent criminals into the market.
''Capos are now in their late 20s, or mid-20s and early 30s,'' said Vanda Felbab-Brown, author of ''Shooting Up: Counterinsurgency and the War on Drugs.'' ''They're people who have no experience with management, with negotiations, and who now need to prove themselves.''
The Cazares women said that they feared a few captors, but that mostly they were treated well. For three nights, teenagers with large weapons told them they would be set free soon, while guarding them in a peach-colored house in a crowded neighborhood. Then, around midnight, three days after they were taken, the kidnappers dropped them off near the loading dock of a nearby Walmart.
They were free. But what about their husbands?
Ransom and the Authorities
The ransom demands began two days later, with telephone calls to a Cazares brother who lives in Texas. ''It's a money problem,'' the kidnappers said, a mantra they would repeat, according to notes taken by a relative. ''And money can fix it.''
Documents the Cazareses filed with the police show that the family said it could provide a few thousand dollars, but instead, the kidnappers gave the family an extra day or two to get the sum they demanded. Calls for ransom often mean that the captives will be released, and the Cazares family made four payments, sending a trusted employee to deliver a total of $100,000 to Matamoros, first to a grocery store parking lot and then behind a fast-food restaurant.
Communication with the kidnappers was handled solely by the family. Members spent days and nights sitting around the kitchen table in Texas waiting for the telephone to ring.
On three occasions, the Cazareses were allowed to speak with one, then two of the five men still being held. On the first call, the men held hostage were mostly concerned about their wives and children. (''We were so in love,'' said the wife from the third house that the kidnappers invaded, fighting back tears at the recollection. ''He was my first boyfriend.'')
The second call ended more abruptly when one of the captives said he wanted to go home. During the final round of calls, on July 27, the kidnappers said they needed only one more payment. The family sent the cash across the border, waiting to see the white van that the kidnappers had said would arrive with their loved ones after the money was received. It never came.
Devastated, the family tried calling the kidnappers' telephone. But it was out of service that day and forever.
Several weeks later, the Cazareses went to the authorities. They first had to overcome their fears since more than a fifth of all kidnappings in Mexico involve police officers or soldiers, according to a 2011 Mexican congressional report, which also explains why kidnapping statistics are undercounts.
The Cazareses reported the crime because, they said, it was their only hope. And since they started pushing for an inquiry, the Cazares women have not stopped. In addition to giving extensive testimony to the local, state and federal authorities, they have written to Mexico's attorney general, human rights officials and Department of Foreign Affairs, as well as President Felipe Calderon. They have also written to President Obama and Pope Benedict XVI.
The response has been defined by minimal effort and cold dismissal.
The local police initially promised to investigate but a month later sent the family a form letter saying the case was out of their jurisdiction. (The department did not respond to e-mails and telephone calls seeking comment; nor did the mayor of Matamoros.)
In September, state investigators with a 50-member antikidnapping squad in Tamaulipas took lengthy statements from family members. But in an interview this month, one of the investigators said that his team had not questioned any potential suspects or witnesses, nor had investigators visited relevant locations.
The investigator, Manuel Adolfo Benavides Parra, said his agency was hoping to get information from two men arrested on federal drug and weapons charges in late November -- men the Cazareses identified as part of the group that kidnapped them. But Mr. Benavides said federal prosecutors had not answered requests for information, preventing him from interrogating the two detainees.
Meanwhile, an official with the Mexican attorney general's office in Tamaulipas insisted that the kidnapping was a state case. He refused to answer questions about the men in federal custody. ''We have nothing else to say,'' he said.
The Cazareses insist that more should have been done by now. The peach-colored house where they were held, which the family says it has identified for the federal authorities in official statements, is a logical starting point. And it is not hard to find. It sits on a street in a crowded working-class neighborhood a block from a major road. This month, an electricity bill stuffed into the door -- without an envelope, and clearly visible -- showed a spike in service during July, and that the last payment was made in January 2011. A next-door neighbor said he knew nothing about the owners, though he admitted there was often suspicious activity there late at night.
He was one of many Matamoros residents who said they no longer felt safe in their city. Indeed, the Cazareses are saddened not just by the loss of their loved ones, but also of their hometown. The neighborhoods where they grew up are now windswept and filled with for-sale signs. Many of the Cazares women struggle with depression. They said that a few people in the federal government had come close to alleviating their pain with offers of help and letters of reassurance, though even then, hopeful moments have dissipated.
In November, for example, a friend put them in touch with Deputy Interior Secretary Felipe Zamora Castro, a high-level official who promised to help. Two days later, Mr. Zamora was killed in the helicopter crash that also took the life of his boss, Francisco Blake Mora, the interior secretary.
Seeking Help Abroad
The Cazareses now say that they are back to square one: lower-level officials at the Interior Ministry have asked that they file official paperwork, which means additional delay.
''Not a single Mexican authority will help us,'' said Zynthia Cazares, the sister of Rodolfo, fidgeting with her jewelry in the Texas home where she now lives amid photographs of the missing and statues of the Virgin Mary. ''God has asked us to have patience, confidence and faith.''
The family has also sought help from abroad. Ludivine Cazares, Rodolfo's wife, recently started to rally support in Europe, writing to French and German officials. The Cazareses are also trying to involve the United States. The five missing men are all Mexican, but as is common in border families, many of their relatives are American citizens or legal residents, and the gang members seem to fear American authority; the 9-year-old boy kidnapped from the first home was dropped off at the border right away, the kidnappers told the women, because he was born in the United States to an American mother who had contacted the F.B.I.
American officials, who were not aware of the Cazares case, said they, too, were extremely frustrated with Mexico's lack of progress on judicial reform, but they added there was little they could do to quickly remedy a problem of law, culture and bureaucracy.
The Cazareses nonetheless want more. They ask why American aid sent to help Mexico to fight the drug cartels still seems so disconnected from victims; why progress -- if there is any -- seems so slow. ''The American money never reaches the people who really need it,'' Zynthia Cazares said, maintaining that her relatives could still be saved. ''We need help. Now.''

1861: The Civil War Awakening, by Adam Goodheart (Vintage, $16.) Goodheart's exhilarating account leads us through the months between Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency in 1860 -- followed quickly by the secession of the Confederate States -- and July 4, 1861, when Lincoln delivered his first message to Congress, laying out the case for war.
SOLO, by Rana Dasgupta (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.95.) Dasgupta's novel, a study in human failure and the wreckage of Communism, revolves around Ulrich, a blind 100-year-old Bulgarian in Sofia who spends his days remembering and daydreaming. Through Ulrich's memories we see nearly a century of Bulgarian history; his ''private fictions'' present a series of contemporary stories about young Eastern Europeans trying to make it big in New York. 
SAUL BELLOW: Letters, edited by Benjamin Taylor (Penguin, $20.) Bellow (1915-2005), whose honors included a Pulitzer, three National Book Awards and a Nobel Prize in Literature, was a voluble letter writer, by turns tender and unsparing, ruminative and hilarious. This collection includes correspondence with his fellow writers -- William Faulkner, John Cheever, Cynthia Ozick, Ralph Ellison -- and creates a sharp-edged portrait of the man, his influences and his legacy.
SAVE ME,by Lisa Scottoline (St. Martin's Griffin, $14.99.) Scottoline nimbly draws on the topic of bullying in this legal thriller. Rose volunteers at school mainly to keep an eye on her third-grade daughter, the target of a viper classmate. When an explosion goes off in the cafeteria kitchen, Rose faces a horrific moral choice, and her actions cause an uproar in her idyllic suburban community. For Glen, the usually mild-mannered accountant in Will Allison's novel LONG DRIVE HOME(Free Press, $14), a fit of road rage -- he swerves into the path of a driver barreling down his sleepy residential block -- creates a downward spiral in his life that seems to have a momentum of its own.
REVOLUTION: The Year I Fell in Love and Went to Join the Sandinistas, by Deb Olin Unferth (St. Martin's Griffin, $14.99.) Nineteen eighty-seven was a fertile time for war in Central America, and Unferth's soulful memoir recounts how she and her boyfriend dropped out of college that year to traipse around the region, interview priests and rebel leaders, protest in front of United States embassies and volunteer for assorted ''revolution jobs.''
THREE STAGES OF AMAZEMENT, by Carol Edgarian (Scribner, $16.) Edgarian's graceful novel, set in Silicon Valley after the boom, explores the intricate economies of a modern American marriage. Once an idealistic television producer, Lena now cares for two children and grieves over the loss of a premature baby. Her husband, Charlie, is a doctor turned entrepreneur, but his desperate search for investors dredges up a painful past that threatens the family.
THE NET DELUSION: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom, by Evgeny Morozov (Public/Affairs, $16.99.) ''What if the liberating potential of the Internet also contains the seeds of depoliticization and thus dedemocratization?'' Morozov asks in this challenging, contrarian book. From television in East Germany to the Twitter-powered Green Revolution in Iran, he examines the Internet's evolving role in activism, dissent and authoritarian regimes.

CHRISTIAN JACOBS
All parents worry that their children will go through a rebellious phase, but how can you reject your dad when he's Christian Jacobs, a creator of hip kids' shows like ''Yo Gabba Gabba!'' and ''The Aquabats! Super Show!''? ''My daughter's in seventh grade, and she wore her 'Yo Gabba' Vans to school with trepidation,'' Jacobs confesses. ''Then all the eighth graders said, 'Oh, those are cool shoes.' As they become teenagers and find out about Weezer or the Flaming Lips, 'Yo Gabba' is cool again.''

I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when this month's Townhall, the conservative magazine, arrived with a cover line blaring, '' '60s Radicals in Power Now,'' and an illustrated S.D.S. logo. (If you have to ask, you're too young to care.) On both sides, this boomer stuff just won't go away: it seems as if aging Republicans, in particular, never tire of running against free love and the Great Society. But I'm betting that won't stop them from using their Medicare.

DOES IT TRICKLE DOWN, MY LORD?
According to a recent study published in Review ofRadical Political Economics, our world may be approaching the unyielding class division of ''Downton Abbey.'' Surveys of more than 60,000 American households from 1996 until 2003 indicated that only the richer households saw income increases when the economy prospered. Alas, my lord, the rich appear to be getting richer, while the poor stay poor.

HOW FAT IS YOUR DOCTOR?
In addition to the hassles and indignities they face on a daily basis, it turns out that overweight people also may not make very good doctors -- at least when it comes to treating overweight patients. Researchers at Johns Hopkins University surveyed 500 primary-care physicians and found that doctors who battled the bulge themselves (those with a body-mass index of 25 or above) were less likely to recognize fatness or offer their patients diet tips. Basically, says the researcher Sara Bleich, ''your doctor is unlikely to diagnose obesity or have weight-loss discussions with you if they weigh more than you.'' Thin doctors, typically, seem to be just freaking perfect.

BURNING JOHN TERRY
The soccer star John Terry has the dubious achievement of being stripped of the English national captaincy twice -- first for reportedly sleeping with his teammate's ex-girlfriend, then for allegedly using a racial slur against an opponent. Now Terry has scored further infamy. His photo graces cigarette packs in India, above the warning ''Smoking Kills.'' How it got there, Indian government officials have said, is unclear.
THE ORIGINAL PALM BEACH STORY
Zora Neale Hurston's novel ''Their Eyes Were Watching God,'' first published 75 years ago, remains a quintessentially Florida story involving a hurricane, a dog attack and a shooting. Kevin Young, a poet and professor, observes that Hurston ''not only collected 'lies' as a folklorist, but lied just to get by.'' Among other things, she claimed to be a bootlegger.
WHY IS THIS BOOK DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER BOOKS?
Jonathan Safran Foer has found yet another way to cement his status as the Brad Pitt of the bubby set. Earlier this month, Little, Brown published ''New American Haggadah,'' Foer's rendition of the traditional text read aloud during the Passover Seder. Translated from Hebrew by the writer Nathan Englander and edited by Foer, it has a literary pedigree to kvell over, but since nearly 5,000 editions of the Haggadah have already been printed, you must wonder: Why is this book different from all the others? ''It's a story,'' Foer says, ''that not only invites but demands retelling.''

HEADLINE: Barriers to Change, From Wall St. and Geneva

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
EVEN now, after all we've been through, something is still wrong with Wall Street.
That's the takeaway from the extraordinary -- and extraordinarily public -- resignation of Greg Smith from Goldman Sachs last week. His criticism of Goldman, made in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times, suggested that some of the business practices and inherent conflicts in the financial industry are as troubling today as they were before all of those taxpayer bailouts.
Goldman disagreed with him, of course. But Mr. Smith's Op-Ed article -- and the resounding response to it -- provide yet another reminder of why it is crucial that we remake our financial markets so that they are safe for investors and taxpayers. 
And yet, the snail's-pace progress of this effort is worrisome. Financial institutions, eager to maintain their profitable status quo, have lobbied hard against change. As a result, too-big-to-fail institutions have become even bigger and more powerful.
In addition to lobbying, big financial players have another potential weapon in their battle against safety and soundness. This one is more hidden from view and comes from, of all places, the World Trade Organization in Geneva.
Back in the 1990s, when many in Washington -- and virtually everyone on Wall Street -- embraced the deregulation that helped lead to the recent crisis, a vast majority of W.T.O. nations made varying commitments to what's called the financial services agreement, which loosens rules governing banks and other such institutions.
Many countries, for instance, said they would not restrict the number of financial services companies in their territories. Many also pledged not to cap the total value of assets or transactions conducted by such companies. These pledges also appear to raise trouble for any country that tries to ban risky financial instruments.
According to the W.T.O., 125 of its 153 member countries have made varying degrees of commitments to the financial services agreement. Now, these pledges could easily be used to undermine new rules intended to make financial systems safer.
What would happen if a country flouted the rules in an attempt to reduce risks in its financial system? Possibly nothing. Then again, that country could find itself subject to a challenge by the W.T.O.
So far, no countries have asked the organization to challenge rule changes like those made in the United States under the Dodd-Frank law. But rumblings of such an objection emerged in late December, in a comment letter sent to United States banking regulators. That letter criticized elements of the Volcker Rule, which is intended to prevent financial companies from making bets for themselves with deposits backed by taxpayers.
The letter was written by the Investment Industry Association of Canada. It called the proposal ''an unprecedented reach of extra-territorial regulation.''
The letter went on: ''As a result, the Volcker Rule may contravene the Nafta trade agreement,'' a reference to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has a broadly similar set of rules to the financial services agreement under the W.T.O. While countries must ask the W.T.O. to mount a challenge under its rules, companies can do so directly under Nafta.
Some countries that are trying to reregulate their financial systems worry that they may run afoul of trade commitments. The delegation for Barbados, for example, wrote last year about the trouble it might encounter imposing new rules while trying to abide by trade agreements.
''The notion of 'too big to fail' has been a concern even prior to the crisis, but the financial crisis realized banking regulators' worst fears,'' Barbados wrote to a W.T.O. committee in early 2011.
Yet nations that committed to the agreement in the 1990s ''may find restrictions on size are contrary to the commitments given to limit adverse affects on financial service suppliers,'' the Barbados letter said.
Barbados suggested amending the agreement on financial services to provide more flexibility. Its proposal was rejected.
Last October, Ecuador asked that the W.T.O. review financial rules so that the country could preserve its ability to create regulations that ensure ''the integrity and stability of the financial system.''
Sounds reasonable enough. But that proposal was rejected by trade representatives for the United States, the European Union and Canada before it could be discussed at a December meeting in Geneva. Through a spokeswoman, Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative, declined to comment.
Maybe nothing will come of any of this. But such trade agreements might well be read as an invitation to fight financial regulation.
One passage, for instance, begins sensibly enough: ''A member shall not be prevented from taking measures for prudential reasons, including for the protection of investors, depositors, policy holders or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial service supplier, or to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system.''
Then it does a U-turn. ''Where such measures do not conform with the provisions of the agreement, they shall not be used as a means of avoiding the member's commitments or obligations under the agreement.''
AS the Barbados delegation wrote in its February 2011 letter, ''An obligation not to restrict financial services in a situation where a member wishes to do so could be interpreted as having the intention of avoiding that obligation.''
All this represents yet another paradox of our financial world: Even as our regulators try to devise a safer financial system, our trade representatives thwart efforts to reduce risks these operations pose to taxpayers.
Leadership, Mr. Smith wrote in his Op-Ed last Wednesday, is about ''doing the right thing.'' That applies off Wall Street, as well as on it.

HEADLINE: 'It's Never Just About the Cupcake'

BYLINE: By KYLE SPENCER

 BODY:
THE Cupcake Wars came to Public School 295 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, in October.
The Parent-Teacher Association's decision to raise the price of a cupcake at its monthly bake sale -- to $1, from 50 cents -- was supposed to be a simple way to raise extra money in the face of city budget cuts.
Instead, in a neighborhood whose median household income leaped to $60,184 in 2010 from $34,878 a decade before, the change generated unexpected ire, pitting cash-short parents against volunteer bakers, and dividing a flummoxed PTA executive board, where wealthier newcomers to the school serve alongside poorer immigrants who have called the area home for years.
''A lot of people felt like they really needed to be heard on this,'' recalled Dan Janzen, a mild-mannered freelance copywriter with children in first and third grades who leads the school's development committee and devised the price increase. 
One mother expressed dismay at being blindsided, while others said they were worried about those at the school without a dollar to spare. Ultimately, the PTA meeting at which the issue came to a head was adjourned without a resolution.
Such fracases are increasingly common at schools like P.S. 295, where changing demographics can cause culture clashes. PTA leaders are often caught between trying to get as much as possible from parents of means without alienating lower-income families.
Sometimes, the battles are over who should lead the PTA itself: many of the gentrifiers bring professional skills and different ideas of how to get things done, while those who improved the school enough to attract them become guardians of its traditions.
So along with cross-cultural exchanges, international festivals and smorgasbords, school diversity can mean raw feelings about race and class bubbling to the surface.
''It's never just about the cupcake,'' said Jeffrey Henig, a professor of political science and education at Teachers College, who has written extensively about this topic. ''The cupcake is the spark.''
Of course it is not always a cupcake. At Public School 11 in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, there has been discord over the annual auction, which last year drew more than $10,000.
P.S. 11, which once had trouble attracting students, has gained popularity in the past few years, drawing the children of owners of new condominiums and beloved brownstones in nearby Fort Greene and Prospect Heights.
The share of students at the school who qualify for a free or reduced-price lunch -- meaning their family income falls below a certain level -- has dropped to 67 percent today, from 86 percent in 2005.
During the planning of the auction, there were accusations of elitism, racism and defeatism, as newcomers and longtime residents debated whether to host a laid-back affair with all-you-can-drink rum punch or something more elegant, featuring donated bottles of wine.
Should auction items be posted online to build excitement even though many families do not have computers at home? A seeming compromise, to offer all-you-can-eat passes for $35 along with $25 tickets that exclude food, only generated more controversy last time around when some people who had bought the lower-priced tickets ate anyway.
''There has been so much distrust and resentment,'' said Eva Marie Arena, who has two children at the school and recently stepped down as chairwoman of the fund-raising committee, citing burnout as one of the reasons. ''There is this idea that we have come into this place that has been one way for so long, and we are bringing with us all our fancy ideas.''
At Public School 110 on the Lower East Side, where the number of children who qualify for a free or reduced-price lunch has dropped to 65 percent today from 86 percent in 2005, conversation has focused on whether or not the annual spring fair -- which features face-painting and craft projects -- should be mostly free or more of a fund-raiser.
And at the East Village Community School, which serves the children of architects and artists as well as those of housekeepers and handymen, a brouhaha broke out after the Parent Association sent a second ''ask'' letter in December -- in previous years there had only been one -- noting that it had met its $20,000 goal but had set a new one.
The letter said 27 percent of families had given money, admonishing, ''We can do better,'' which led to a backlash, especially since the push came at the same time as other fund-raising initiatives: a holiday book sale and a $20 parents' night out.
''It's a tricky thing,'' acknowledged Patricia Davies, a nonprofit management consultant who helped write the controversial letter. ''It's fund-raising. So you want to be aggressive. But this is also a public school.''
In Harlem, century-old brownstones and gleaming high rises have lured a growing pool of middle-class families to P.S./I.S. 180, where a handful of students privately confessed to the PTA president, Carmen Reyes, that their families could not afford the $20 bracelet that provided access to all the games and food at the popular fall fund-raising fair. So Ms. Reyes proposed that they help decorate in exchange for entry bracelets, which she said pleased the students.
Carrie Reynolds, a former book editor who is a co-president of the PTA at P.S. 163 on West 97th Street, said she worked hard to fight off the impression that PTA-sponsored events are designed for ''rich people.'' That can be a challenge at a school where 56 percent of the students receive free or reduced-price lunches (down from 68 percent in 2005) and tickets to the Winter Gala run $65.
Recent auction items -- including a backstage tour of the Metropolitan Opera and a weekend getaway in the country -- have gone for hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of dollars (though at fancier schools, five figures for featured items can be the norm).
To balance this, P.S. 163 also hosts informal events, like its International Celebration in March, where families bring in homemade empanadas, shrimp fried rice, and deep dish lasagna, which are displayed in the cafeteria along with flags and sometimes traditional garb from their countries of origin. The school begins the year with a series of free gatherings -- a welcome breakfast and a Saturday play date in the schoolyard -- before asking anyone for money. And the PTA also organizes a shadow online auction around the time of the gala that features things like $25 restaurant coupons.
Some other PTAs, including those at P.S. 261 in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, and P.S. 11 in Chelsea, are trying to emulate professional fund-raising outfits, by quietly reaching out to the splattering of bankers and small business owners for large donations, while largely bypassing those who have less. This, of course, has managed to offend people on both sides.
At P.S. 295 in Sunset Park, efforts to bridge gaps both economic and ethnic are pronounced. The PTA requires that posters advertising fund-raisers and other events include English and Spanish, and members often brainstorm about how to engage parents with limited resources, contemplating everything from the bus fare to the cost of feeding a large family. For the Spring Arts Festival and the Harvest Festival, $2 worth of tickets are tucked into every student's backpack, enough to buy a meal.
But some of the wealthier parents were disappointed that one of their lower-cost events, a $5 winter concert series titled Beat the Blahs, drew a meager crowd to hear Cumbiagra, a local band that plays music from Colombia's coastal region. Estela Bernabe, who has a fourth grader at the school and sometimes clocks 12-hour shifts as a baby sitter, said she thought she spoke for many in saying her absence was not politically charged. ''I'm working,'' she explained. ''I just don't have the time.''
A truce of sorts, meanwhile, has been called in the cupcake wars. The price is still $1, but two words have been added to the regular notice in the school bulletin: ''Suggested donation.''

IT has long been assumed that filmmakers should tread carefully in the wake of tragedy. Whether confronting war or genocide, a terrorist attack or a natural disaster, the importance of bearing witness bumps up against the danger of trivialization and exploitation. In the annals of catastrophe cinema Japan's triple disaster has proved to be an unusually accelerated case. Within months of the powerful earthquake and tsunami of March 11, 2011, which killed thousands and caused the reactor meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, there were already enough movies on the subject to constitute an all-but-instant subgenre.
The Berlin Film Festival last month featured three documentaries on the aftermath, dealing collectively with topics like the complications of the cleanup effort, the plight of evacuees and the resurgent anti-nuclear movement. Japan Society in New York marked the first anniversary with screenings of films like ''The Tsunami and the Cherry Blossom,'' a short documentary by Lucy Walker that was nominated for an Academy Award, and ''Pray for Japan,'' which its director, Stu Levy, made while volunteering in the stricken Tohoku region. 
The list of documentaries is long and growing: the Fukushima crisis was the subject of a recent ''Frontline'' episode, and the Japanese broadcaster NHK ran a March 11 program every day in the week leading up to the anniversary. But this new strain of post-traumatic cinema also includes several fiction films, like Masahiro Kobayashi's ''Women on the Edge,'' a drama in which three estranged sisters reunite amid the wreckage of their hometown, and ''Himizu,'' an adaptation of a manga about troubled teenagers that the director, Sion Sono, quickly rewrote to incorporate a backdrop of actual devastation.
The first major attempt at a survey of March 11 cinema came last October at the Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival, situated just on the other side of a mountain range from the Fukushima area. Struck by the number of disaster-theme submissions, Asako Fujioka, director of the festival's Tokyo office, said she and her colleagues decided to screen everything that came their way. The idea, Ms. Fujioka wrote in an e-mail, was to ''eliminate the curatorial hand'' and instead present ''a makeshift visual archive.'' The Yamagata festival showed 29 films about the earthquake's aftermath in a program called ''Cinema With Us.'' Some took an oblique approach, like an omnibus project initiated by the filmmaker Naomi Kawase, which included contributions from well-known auteurs, like Apichatpong Weerasethakul of Thailand and Jia Zhangke of China, on the notion of home, but most were on-the-ground dispatches from the hardest-hit areas.
The sheer volume of responses, and the speed with which filmmakers have reacted, speaks to any number of factors: the convenience of digital recording technology, the velocity of today's 24/7 news cycle, the scale of the catastrophe (which killed thousands and has displaced many more) and the perceived need to counter government positions and news media reports (which have come under scrutiny and criticism).
Some suggest deeper impulses. ''It became almost an obligation to do something about the quake, to the point that doing something else was somewhat regarded as a sin,'' said Toshi Fujiwara, whose film ''No Man's Zone,'' about the abandoned towns in the Fukushima area, was shown in Berlin.
Chris Fujiwara, , the artistic director of the Edinburgh International Film Festival and formerly a lecturer at Tokyo University (no relation to Toshi Fujiwara), noted that many of the films ''raise explicitly, or allude to, a very broad and rich context for understanding what the disaster has revealed about Japanese society.''
A philosophically inclined essay film, ''No Man's Zone'' considers what it means to film something invisible: the radioactive molecules that may have made the region uninhabitable for generations to come and the agrarian way of life there that was already disappearing before being perhaps erased for good. Atsushi Funahashi's ''Nuclear Nation,'' which was also screened in Berlin, depicts the daily lives of a group of nuclear refugees who were forced to leave the town of Futaba and the regrets of the mayor, now without a town, who speaks candidly of the local economy's Faustian dependence on nuclear money.
The films have inspired debate not only about such issues but also about the methods of the filmmakers. Some of the documentaries that were shown in Yamagata sparked vigorous discussions, according to Ms. Fujioka, who added that the films often ''reveal the unease of the filmmaker, caught between two emotions: an urge and sense of duty to record the reality, and a sense of guilt of intruding and possibly taking advantage of the victims' tragedy.''
Many of the ethical questions about documenting disaster center on the difficulty of reconciling outsider perspectives with the experiences of those who were directly affected. With the March 11 movies these concerns may also be ''colored by Japanese cultural notions of decency and shame,'' Chris Fujiwara said. In ''311,'' one of the more controversial films at Yamagata, four Tokyo filmmakers chronicle their journey to the Fukushima area. What begins as an awkward, blackly comic road trip, cameras trained on Geiger counters, becomes even more discomfiting as they interview traumatized residents, document the retrieval of bodies and are told, more than once, to stop filming.
The conflict between locals and big-city interlopers mirrors an underlying dynamic of the Fukushima crisis: The crippled plant was operated by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and generated energy for consumption in Tokyo, some 150 miles away.
Ethics and aesthetics are particularly intertwined in these films, calling to mind Jean-Luc Godard's famous pronouncement that tracking shots are a matter of morality. As with their Hurricane Katrina counterparts, many of these films show large expanses of rubble and debris, typically in a long traveling shot from a moving vehicle. The visual motif captures the magnitude of the devastation but can also reek of disaster tourism.
Among the most nuanced of the Fukushima films, ''No Man's Zone'' is also perhaps the one most aware of the subgenre's potential problems. Shooting within the depopulated, badly damaged 12-mile evacuation zone, Mr. Fujiwara relies mainly on a tripod-mounted camera that lingers on the intrinsic beauty of the landscapes; the voice-over questions our morbid attraction to images of destruction and mentions the reluctance of the cameraman to walk on the ruins.
A few other filmmakers have also struck a contemplative note. Jon Jost, the veteran independent American filmmaker (''Sure Fire''), attended the Yamagata festival last year and visited the affected regions close by. He is now finishing a film he shot on an island near the quake's epicenter. Titled ''The Narcissus Flowers of Katsura-shima,'' it incorporates landscape shots and traditional Japanese poetry. The experimental filmmaker Takashi Makino's unconventional response to Fukushima is a short film called ''Generator,'' which envisions Tokyo as a disintegrating organism, through abstract, pulsing images.
The Yamagata festival's ''Cinema With Us'' program has traveled around Japan in recent months. Ms. Fujioka said that some audiences, especially in the disaster zones, were moved to tears, but she also noticed a lack of interest in certain regions. ''People, especially young people, seem to want to move on now that they are not in danger themselves,'' she said. ''There is a bit of disaster fatigue.''
But the films show no sign of stopping. Some of the March 11 filmmakers, including Mr. Funahashi and Mr. Fujiwara, are working on sequels. Mr. Fujiwara said he remains compelled to investigate other aspects of the Fukushima area, like its archaeological history, but he also wonders if the public conversations started by the crises have gained any real traction.
''We continue to evade the debates,'' he said, adding that much of the dialogue has devolved into a ''fetishization of disaster.'' As he sees it, the biggest crime for a filmmaker would be to tackle this subject without a clear point of view. Given the gravity of the situation, he said, it was not enough simply to reflect the persistent mood of confusion: ''These people have lost their homes, their family members, an entire lifestyle. If you don't know what to shoot, then don't shoot. Go home. Leave them alone in peace.''

HEADLINE: A Big Bet Gone Bad

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SOKOLOVE

 BODY:
Nearly everything about the Foxwoods Resort Casino is improbable, beginning with its scale. It is the largest casino in the Western Hemisphere -- a gigantic, labyrinthine wonderland set down in a cedar forest and swamp in an otherwise sleepy corner of southeastern Connecticut. Forty thousand patrons pack into Foxwoods on weekend days. The place has 6,300 slot machines. Ten thousand employees. If you include everything -- hotel space, bars and restaurants, theaters and ballrooms, spa, bowling alley -- Foxwoods measures about 6.7 million square feet, more than the Pentagon.
The owner of this enterprise is the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation. Once powerful and even feared, the Pequots were nearly extinguished in one day -- in fact, in just one hour -- when English colonists and their Indian allies attacked and torched the main Pequot village near Mystic in the spring of 1637. The survivors were sold into slavery or given over to neighboring tribes. The colonists even barred the use of the Pequot name, ''in order to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth,'' as the leader of the raiding party later wrote. 
In the early 1970s, just one resident remained on a Pequot reservation in Ledyard, now the site of Foxwoods -- an elderly woman named Elizabeth George. Her grandson was Richard Hayward (known as Skip), a pipe welder and a former short-order cook with an audacious vision, innate political skills and a flair for dealmaking. Through his efforts, the tribe won federal recognition in 1983. In 1986, it opened a high-stakes bingo hall. Full-blown casino gambling came to Foxwoods in 1992 and in the two decades since has produced not millions but billions of dollars of revenue. Not surprisingly, the casino and its largess rejuvenated the tribe, whose population is now about 900. (Members trace their bloodlines to 11 Pequot families counted in a 1900 census.)
These days the tribe is dealing with the latest improbability in its turbulent history: financial havoc. The casino is underwater, like a five-bedroom Spanish colonial in a Nevada subdivision. The Pequots misjudged the market, borrowed too much and expanded unwisely. Foxwoods's debt is on a scale befitting the size of the property -- $2.3 billion.
It would be easy to look at what has occurred at Foxwoods and think, Here are people who fell into money and didn't know how to handle it. Which happens to be true. But how the casino reached this point, and the challenges its owners and operators now confront, is part of a much larger story -- one involving the gradual relaxation of moral prohibitions against gambling, a desperate search for new revenue by state governments and the proliferation of new casinos across America. Casino gambling has become a commodity, available within a day's drive to the vast majority of U.S. residents. Some in the industry talk of there being an oversupply, as if their product were lumber or soybeans.
Foxwoods has had its own in-state competition since 1996 from the Mohegan Sun, which lies just west, across the Thames River. Owned by the Mohegan Tribe, it is a more modest property, though only by comparison -- Mohegan is the second-largest casino in the hemisphere. In October, a casino opened at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens with 4,500 slot machines, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pushing an expansion plan for the site that includes a hotel and what would be the nation's largest convention center. And lawmakers in Massachusetts recently voted to issue licenses for a slots parlor and three full resort casinos -- an especially ominous development for the Connecticut casinos, which draw about 30 percent of their clientele from Massachusetts, because many gamblers are ruled by what is known in the business as the law of gravity. They stop where the pull is the strongest, which is usually the nearest casino.
Scott Butera is Foxwoods's chief executive, its seventh since 2007. Some of the Pequots call him Eagle, for Eagle Eyes, because he notices everything, whether it's an error in a financial document or a slight stain in a carpet. Some also refer to the tall, gaunt Butera as Woody, after the character in the ''Toy Story'' movies. Butera, who is 45, has managed troubled casino operations for Donald Trump and Carl Icahn, so he is accustomed to difficult bosses and jobs. In the industry, he is known as a turnaround artist. ''My wife keeps telling me to get out of the restructuring business,'' he said recently as we sat in his spacious office across from the Grand Pequot Tower, one of several high-rises in the Foxwoods complex. ''It just sucks you dry.''
This job is Butera's most complex yet. The initial lender to Foxwoods was Genting, a Malaysian conglomerate, but the tribe is now indebted to an enormous tangle of banks and bondholders. The fact that Foxwoods is on sovereign tribal land complicates everything. It means the lenders cannot foreclose and take control of the gambling operation but also that Foxwoods probably doesn't qualify for Chapter 11 -- a conundrum that Butera described as ''sort of like being stuck in no man's land'' and one that financial backers of Indian casinos apparently did not foresee until Foxwoods tanked. ''We have six layers of creditors and, within each layer, 20 to 40 institutions,'' Butera told me.''It's unbelievable. What you have to do is convince them that $2.3 billion of debt is not worth $2.3 billion. And it's not. Our junior debt was trading at 5 cents on the dollar. So you want to come to a place where even though the lenders are getting a haircut on the face value, they know they're getting an incredible lift on what it's actually worth. That's the magic.''
Butera's interactions with the Pequots, his bosses, involve a different kind of magic -- something more like family therapy. The tribe built new housing, a child-development center, ballfields and tennis courts, a spacious community building with a health club and an indoor-outdoor pool; just about everything on the reservation, which lies ''across the swamp'' from the casino, as tribal members put it, is faced in exquisitely crafted stone. The piece de resistance was a $225 million museum to commemorate the Pequots' tragic history and stunning resurrection.
The costliest regular expenditures were the annual dividends of at least $100,000 given to each adult member of the tribe. Cumulatively, they amounted to as much as $500 million over nearly two decades. They were called incentive payments, though for many they were actually disincentives to work. Children began getting the disbursements when they turned 18. Luxury automobiles abounded. The payments stopped just before Butera arrived in late 2010, and more Pequots have been going to work at Foxwoods. ''You had this big moneymaking enterprise with a limited amount of mouths to feed,'' Butera said. ''But everything's about austerity now. It's no different than what a family would do. You've got to get rid of the cable TV. You've got to get rid of the Cadillac. You're not going to go out to eat anymore.''
Butera and I set off on a walk around Foxwoods's gambling floors and hotel and retail spaces, a tour he takes a couple of times a day. He was limping, though not as badly as before recent hip-replacement surgery. He had put off the operation as long as he could but decided that the leader of such a struggling venture should not look as if each step he takes may be his last. ''Have you been up to the Paragon?'' he asked me, referring to a rooftop restaurant and casino designed for high rollers. ''We have like 15 kinds of Brazilian wood in there. It's just insane.'' He said he had seen plans for future improvements, all based on expectations that the money would never stop flowing. ''Incredible, creative stuff,'' he said. ''Water parks. Monorails. Indoor skiing. It was going to be Disneyland under a glass roof.''
The glamour and sexiness of casinos can be highly overrated. Depending on your mood (and how much you've had to drink), Las Vegas can be alluring, weirdly fascinating or just disgusting. Foxwoods, under any circumstances, is not really sexy. It's New England. The furniture in the hotel rooms is big and overstuffed and makes you think about curling up and reading a book. (A renovation to modernize them is under way.) Some of the retail space in the vast corridors between its four large casinos is meant to look like a flea market. In one of these hallways, a brick facade has a sign that says ''Town Hall'' and is meant to evoke . . . well, it's not clear. Perhaps a polling place for the New Hampshire primary.
Foxwoods planned to close at 2 a.m. after its grand opening on Feb. 15, 1992, but hundreds of gamblers remained inside, so the lights stayed on, the dealers kept dealing and ever since -- through hurricanes, blizzards and national crises -- it has remained open every minute of every day. The region was starved for gambling. Located halfway between New York City and Boston, Foxwoods expanded as quickly as it could build, adding casino space and hotel rooms with little regard for cost or coherence.
In 2006, the tribe began construction on a new tower, the MGM Grand at Foxwoods. The project is what finally sent Foxwoods into a financial tailspin. By the time it opened in 2008 -- with 800 hotel rooms, 1,400 slot machines and a 4,000-seat theater -- the recession had hit and was deepening. ''I can understand the mind-set at the time that behemoth was coming out of the ground,'' Rodney Butler, who was elected chairman of the Pequot tribe in 2009, said when I visited his office. ''The human spirit wants to believe that everyone is entrepreneurial. And it's fun to do, right? You figure you had one great success, you can have more. That's the American way.''
It was not just entrepreneurial zeal that caused the Pequots to overreach. ''Every consultant, every analyst and every banker on the planet encouraged us to keep getting bigger,'' Butler said. ''If it wasn't for that, I'd say, Jeez, maybe we're just idiots. But these were smart people. Then we opened the doors at the MGM Grand, and five months later, Lehman crashes and the world falls apart.''
Some people erroneously address Butler as Chief, a ceremonial and spiritual position that the Pequots have not filled for decades. If you didn't know his background, you might assume he is a light-skinned African-American. The 11 family lines include strains of many other ethnicities, and most Pequots are a mix of several. Some just look white. (In ''Hitting the Jackpot,'' published in 2003, Brett D. Fromson documents a history of racial tension in the tribe that deepened with the building of Foxwoods and the money it produced.) Butler, 35, played football at the University of Connecticut, earned a degree in finance and serves on the board of the local United Way. He is analytical and low-key, a contrast to Skip Hayward, the tribal leader who cut the deals that built Foxwoods in a joint called Mr. Pizza and held court late into the night at local bars.
I told Butler that I found the Pequot Museum impressive. ''You don't think it's a little over the top?'' he said. Well, yes, but the exhibits make clear, in a way a casino never could, that the Pequots were a significant people whose reach once extended across much of southern New England. In the raid that nearly wiped out the Pequots, the Mohegans were among the colonists' primary allies. ''And now we've got dueling casinos,'' Butler said. ''This year will be the 375th anniversary of the year they rallied against us with the colonists. There's still some bad blood over that, a little animosity, but mostly, we recognize them as our cousins, and we work well together.''
The Pequots, even with their substantial political clout in Connecticut, may not have been able to keep the Mohegans out of the casino market. But they never really mobilized against them. ''They thought the cluster of casinos would bring more business,'' Butera told me. ''It didn't work out that way. Would we be better off if Mohegan wasn't here? Yeah, but they're not going away.''
The Mohegan Sun enjoys several advantages, starting with its location. It is just off an exit on I-395, while Foxwoods is a 20-minute ride down a winding two-lane road. Mohegan has a younger clientele and a hipper vibe. When you enter its main hotel lobby, you notice right away that the lighting is better and the music more current. The idea behind Foxwoods's new MGM Grand Tower was to add an element of glitz and to create an ambience -- right down to the revealing outfits of the servers in the casino -- that might attract some of Mohegan's younger patrons.
Mohegan is smaller, but in recent years it has generated more revenue. The Mohegans own a second casino, in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, and are expected to compete for a license in Massachusetts. (Foxwoods won a license to build a casino in Philadelphia, but its financial problems prompted the state's gaming control board to revoke it in 2010.) The Mohegan Sun has struggled recently, too, and the tribe is seeking to restructure its debt, but the casino's problems are not considered as deep, and its management has been more stable and nimble. Speaking to a gathering of financial analysts in 2009, Mitchell Etess, the Mohegan Sun's C.E.O., said, ''We've been very cautious, especially lately, to make sure everybody realizes we're not Foxwoods.''
Casinos came to Nevada in 1931 and were not legalized anywhere else in the U.S. for nearly five decades, an indication of how many Americans regarded gambling as squarely within the realm of vice and sin. In 1978, casinos opened in a second location, Atlantic City. It is not coincidental that the seaside resort was already a fallen place, poor and crime-ridden and hanging on to its one unique attraction, the annual Miss America Pageant.
You can still hear echoes of a time when gambling was widely considered wicked. When Rodney Butler raised the prospect of dropping the gambling age in Connecticut from 21 to 18 and allowing liquor sales until 4 a.m., The Hartford Courant's editorial page objected, writing, ''Why not just open a brothel?''
Resistance to gambling, however, has been overwhelmed by the need for new sources of public revenue in an era when it has become nearly impossible, at any level of government, to raise taxes or even to let temporary tax cuts expire. A kind of self-perpetuating momentum fuels gambling's growth: the more states that legalize it, the more politicians in states that haven't done so argue that if their citizens are going to throw money into slot machines, they might as well do it at home. ''Those people would lose that money anyway,'' Ed Rendell, the voluble former governor of Pennsylvania, said in a tense appearance on ''60 Minutes'' last year. Teeth clenched, he continued, ''You're simpletons, you're idiots if you don't get that.''
Butera reacts to the debates over gambling with a sense of amusement. ''Few governors or senators or House members want to say, 'I absolutely love having casinos in my market,' '' he said. ''It's more like: 'We can manage this. And here's what we'll do. We'll put it in the right place, it won't impact our society too much and we'll make some money.' ''
Casino gambling exists in 36 states. Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988, and around 450 Indian casinos now dot the American landscape. Some are no more than trailers on barren, remote land, but several are large resort casinos near major population centers.
Connecticut's agreement, or compact, with the Pequots permits various table games at Foxwoods, including blackjack, poker and roulette, along with lesser-known games of chance like chuck-a-luck, pan game, money-wheels and bouncing ball. The main action at Foxwoods and everywhere in the U.S. casino market, though, is slots, which in most casinos account for at least 70 percent of gambling revenues. Foxwoods agreed to pay the state 25 percent of the ''hold'' from slot machines -- the money that gamblers put in and is not returned to them in winnings. While casino opponents in Connecticut have attributed increased traffic, crime and gambling addiction to Foxwoods and Mohegan, those problems would have to be breathtakingly deep and costly to equal the dollars that have flowed to the state.
In January, Mohegan's hold from its slots was $52 million; Foxwoods's was $46 million. Connecticut's share from both came to $24.8 million. Over the last two decades, the monthly payments have added about $6 billion to the state treasury. About half of that is estimated to have come from out-of-state residents, the majority of them from Massachusetts and New York. ''Some states weren't paying attention -- they just thought Indian casinos were going to be big bingo halls,'' Clyde W. Barrow, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, and an expert on the New England casino market, told me. ''Connecticut was ahead of the game. They understood the potential.''
Non-Indian gambling operations, known as commercial casinos, have multiplied in every region of the country: from the stolid Midwest, where Iowa alone has 17 commercial casinos, to Mississippi's Gulf Coast, which has become a mini-Las Vegas, to the mid-Atlantic region, the latest boom market. A proposed $1 billion casino in Maryland has attracted powerful business and political support. It would be on the banks of the Potomac, about 10 miles south of the White House.
Most people probably would not guess which state reaps the most revenue from its casinos. It is Pennsylvania, which in 2010 collected $1.3 billion from slots and table-game revenues. The state had just 10 casinos, but Rendell negotiated an agreement that requires them to turn over 55 percent of the hold from their slots to the state -- an advantageous deal for the public and one that showed other states what casino owners will tolerate to gain entry into a market. ''It is considered a privilege to be in this industry, and we pay for that privilege in very high taxes,'' Frank Fahrenkopf, the president of the American Gaming Association, told me when I visited his office in Washington.
The silver-haired Fahrenkopf, a chairman of the Republican National Committee in the Reagan years, is known as an adroit Washington player, the type who can make light of his high status while also fully inhabiting it. He showed me what he called his ''I love me'' wall, pictures of him with other important people. ''Everybody in Washington has to have one,'' he said. ''That's me with Helmut and Margaret,'' he said of one picture, signaling his first-name relationships with Helmut Kohl and Margaret Thatcher.
The A.G.A. represents only commercial casinos, 566 of them in 22 states. An economic impact study commissioned by the organization last year counted $34.6 billion in nationwide gambling revenues in 2010. That represents money that individuals bet, lost and left behind in casinos. According to the study, casinos supported 820,000 jobs, created $125 billion in spending and accounted for close to 1 percent of the U.S. gross-domestic product. (Those figures come from only commercial casinos. Foxwoods, Mohegan and other Indian casinos were not included.) ''I know there are people who hate this industry and who are always going to hate this industry,'' Fahrenkopf said. ''If you look at polling, it's a solid 15 percent, and the other 85 percent are O.K. with it. But you see the contribution we make, in terms of jobs, and the taxes we pay. We're proud of that.''
The name of the organization Fahrenkopf leads, the American Gaming Association, drops the ''b'' and the ''l'' from ''gambling.'' In fact, no one in the casino business says ''gambling.'' They are in the business of ''gaming'' -- an enterprise that could not exist without euphemisms and various legal workarounds. There are, for example, the so-called riverboat casinos that get around prohibitions against gambling on land; most of the boats never leave the shoreline. Some Midwest casinos are plopped down in shallow water in concrete basins and are known as ''boats in a moat.''
The racino, a more recent innovation, is a slots parlor built at an existing horse-racing track -- ground already touched and therefore tainted by gambling. In February, I took the A train from Midtown Manhattan to South Ozone Park in Queens, where a racino has been joined to the century-old Aqueduct racetrack. It is called the Resorts World Casino New York City and is owned by a subsidiary of the Genting Group, the corporation that financed the construction of Foxwoods. Even on a Monday afternoon, thousands of people -- white, black, Asian and Hispanic, drawn from the great melting pot of Queens and nearby boroughs and suburbs -- were playing the slot machines. Except technically they weren't slots, but video lottery terminals, or V.L.T.'s.
What's a V.L.T.? It's a slot machine.
Under New York state law, however, slots are illegal. With a V.L.T., the result of each play is determined by a central computer and not by circuitry within the machine itself, as is the case with slot machines. That somehow makes it legal. Most gamblers wouldn't notice a difference, and no one I talked to inside Aqueduct, not even people who worked there, had ever heard of a V.L.T.
Governor Cuomo wants New York to change its state constitution to permit Las Vegas-style gambling with table games, live dealers and slot machines that can be called slot machines. His pitch is based on the prospect of gaining new revenues for the state -- and overturning the hypocrisy of the current system. ''In a perfect world, there would be no casinos,'' he told the editorial board of The Syracuse Post-Standard in February. Referring to New York's ''hodgepodge'' of Indian casinos and state-sanctioned racinos, he said: ''We have 29,000 gambling machines in this state, more than Atlantic City. . . . You have gaming! You're just in denial of the reality.''
A casino floor can seem like a throwback to a time decades ago when personal habits were judged less harshly and physical fitness was not considered such a virtue. ''Sometimes, it's a beautiful day out, and you think to yourself, Oh, God, nobody's going to come in here,'' Scott Butera told me in one of our conversations. ''But they do. Our crowd wants to sit in front of a slot machine, smoke a cigarette and drink. They're not going water skiing out at Mystic Seaport.''
A substantial number of casino patrons have mobility issues, and you see a lot of wheelchairs. People who work on casino floors take pride in getting to know their regular customers, the names of their children and grandchildren and even their health issues. ''You look around here, and 45 is young,'' Butera said as we walked between rows of slots at Foxwoods.
The slot machines themselves, in the cartoonish and often hilarious political incorrectness of their imagery, hark back to some other era -- for example, crudely drawn geishas, Asian ''emperors'' and a ''bandito'' in a game called More Chilis that would embarrass the proprietor of the lowest-end Tex-Mex joint you can imagine. At the casino industry's big annual convention in Las Vegas, which is in part a trade show for slots manufacturers, a machine called Girls Day Out included a leather purse and a purple cocktail dress among its spinning icons. The featured icons in its companion game, Guys Night, were things meant to get men excited: dancing girls, cigars, overstuffed hamburgers. The big new rollout at the show was a ''Ghostbusters'' slot machine, a homage to the 1984 movie. The game's audio played a section of dialogue from the movie, which seemed like a sly insertion of the designers' dark humor: ''We'd like to get a sample of your brain tissue.''
Foxwoods does have table games, including blackjack and poker. Most casinos of any size court big players, those who will risk hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. High rollers are brought in by private jet and helicopter, installed in sumptuous suites with butler service and sometimes granted specially tailored rules on their game of choice. In some cases, casinos will even agree in advance to discount losses: if a player comes in with, say, a $1 million bankroll and loses it all, $200,000 will be returned.
The table games pose some risk for casinos. When I was at Foxwoods, the casino had just been ''beaten,'' as Butera put it, for close to $1 million by a blackjack player. ''It happens,'' he said.
Butera told me about another blackjack player who had recently beaten several Atlantic City casinos for more than $15 million. According to published reports, the player, a Pennsylvania businessman named Don Johnson, won $5.8 million at the Tropicana in just 12 hours. The word in the industry was that Johnson benefited from his own solid strategy, a run of great luck and rules that were tilted too much in his direction. He apparently was allowed to bet relatively small amounts when the deck was not in his favor, and up to $100,000 on a single hand when it was. (Also, under typical casino rules, if a blackjack player is dealt two aces, he can split those aces and play two hands, but if he gets another on the next deal, he can't split again. Johnson was allowed to split aces a third and even a fourth time.)
The lesson that Butera and others on his management team drew was that the Atlantic City casinos had negotiated away too much of their house advantage, something they said was common at Foxwoods under previous management teams. Butera told me that he has instructed those under him to ''just say no and let a guy walk down the street and play somewhere else'' rather than agree to rules that shave off too much of the casino's advantage. We were on the gambling floor, and Butera was focused, as he often is, on his dealers. He wants them to be friendly and to ''root for the player to win'' but to keep the game brisk. ''The more hands a player is dealt, the better it is for us,'' he said. Butera, who has an M.B.A. from N.Y.U., invoked a gambling term -- ''vig,'' short for ''vigorish,'' meaning the house's cut of the action. ''The math is the math,'' he said. ''Over time, we'll make our vig.''
At the annual Global Gaming Expo in Las Vegas last October, I listened as A. K. Singh, a mathematician and professor of gaming at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, advised a roomful of casino executives that they could probably increase the hold on their slot machines by a percentage point or two without losing business. He said that some academic literature suggested that skilled slots players would notice, but he disagreed. ''What is a skilled player?'' he said with a laugh. ''There is no skill.''
The difference between table games and slot machines is that slots are entirely predictable. They're like A.T.M.'s, but in reverse -- programmed to take money from players, usually about 9 cents of every dollar wagered, while producing frequent near misses, the illusion that a big jackpot was at hand if only, say, just one more overstuffed burger had landed on the pay line. The lower the house's hold on a slot machine -- and the higher the number of small payouts -- the longer a player's T.O.D. (time on device). It's a fine balance. Casinos want customers to lose their money, but not so rapidly that they'll feel the whole experience was a bummer and not want to return.
The gaming confab, known as G2E, offers a sort of crash course in the state of the industry. ''We have the power to control luck,'' Michael Meczka, a veteran casino marketing consultant from Los Angeles, said at another session. But much of the rest of his presentation was about the uncertainty gripping the business, what casinos cannot control. His remarks, in fact, were a bit grim -- they reminded me of the despair you hear in the newspaper business over the advanced age of the core customers and the fear that younger people do not like the product enough to replace them.
Millions of younger Americans who like to gamble are playing online poker, hosted on offshore sites. They may never become casino habitues. So at the same time that brick-and-mortar casinos are proliferating, the demographics may be working against the industry. The A.G.A. is lobbying for legalization of online poker in the United States and for strict regulation of it -- a rare case of an industry's seeking regulation. The strategy would likely put those who already own casinos in a favored position in the new online world.
The big buzzword in the business right now is ''cannibalization.'' It refers, in this context, to casinos' gobbling up one anothers' customers, which for some of them may be the only route to survival. Fahrenkopf, the A.G.A. president, said he was not worried. ''What about Starbucks?'' he said as I sat in his Washington office. ''A block east of here, a block west, a block north is a Starbucks. How much is too much? The market will decide.''
Las Vegas, still the anchor of the gambling industry in the U.S., was battered by the recession, and its revenues from gambling still lag far behind 2007 levels. The city's recovery could be hurt by a building boom in big Indian casinos in California -- and, over time, by new properties in New York, Massachusetts and other Northeast states. The biggest winner in Las Vegas in recent years has been Sheldon Adelson, chairman of the company that owns the Venetian, but what has made him one of the wealthiest men in the world is not his U.S. holdings but his ownership of hugely profitable casinos in the Chinese territory of Macao. (Adelson has been in the news recently because he and his wife have contributed more than $10 million to support Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign.)
Farhrenkopf acknowledged that when the market does decide, it can have adverse consequences -- in Atlantic City, for example, where casino revenue is down 37 percent since 2006 and the city's future as a gambling mecca is very much in doubt. Rooms at hotel casinos have been going for as little as $19 a night. At least four casinos have been in bankruptcy, and people are no longer crowding onto buses to head south down the Atlantic City Expressway. ''The Pennsylvania casinos are killing Atlantic City,'' he said. ''That's where the Philadelphia market used to go, but now they can stay home.''
It's that specter -- once-loyal players who disappear -- that Foxwoods must worry about. At the Las Vegas conference, Meczka said that when people in the industry tell him they want new customers, his response is: ''There aren't any new customers out there. Gaming is an aged community. . . . Anyone who has ever wanted to try a casino has tried a casino.'' In other words, the market is not expanding -- only the venues meant to cater to a finite number of gamblers.
When I toured Foxwoods with Christopher O'Connell, the vice president for hotel operations, we looked at some of the back-room operations: a call center, where about 130 people, divided among three shifts, book reservations and answer other inquiries; a corridor with a long line of lockers, where dealers store their personal belongings; cafeterias that serve about 5,000 meals a day to employees. In better economic times, these might seem like lower-level service-industry jobs. In the current climate, they just looked like jobs.
O'Connell grew up in Ledyard, Conn., and was a basketball star at Ledyard High. ''There was no reason to ever go to this side of town,'' he told me. ''It was a swamp, that's all, and a reservation, but there was hardly anything on the reservation.'' He has worked there for most of his adult life. ''I'm interested to see what happens with Aqueduct,'' he said. ''They don't have table games yet, but everyone figures they will. With Massachusetts, it's only a matter of time before they get casinos. It's scary from my perspective.''
When Butera showed me around the property, it was clear that much about it irritates him. The restaurant choices, for starters. ''You want a steak, we'll give you a steak,'' he said. ''You want a doughnut, you can have that. We just don't have much in between. We need a Yard House, an Applebee's, a T. G. I. Friday's, a Cheesecake Factory.'' He noted the absence of a seafood restaurant. ''We're in New England, and we don't have a fish house?'' We walked by some of the flea-market-like retail. ''All this honky-tonk has to go,'' he said.
What encourages Butera is the immensity of the property and the richness of what has already been built. ''I mean, you look at this place, the money that's in the ground, nobody could afford to do that now. But the good news is it's already here. We've got it. The business needs to evolve, but the foundation that exists is unbelievable.''
A successful turnaround artist does more than negotiate favorable terms with lenders. He must tell a story. He elucidates what went wrong in the past and how it will be better in the future. It can help to be blunt about previous management, even harsh -- like a defense lawyer pleading for a new trial for his client on the basis that the previous attorney was incompetent. Butera brought in an almost entirely new management team, including people he knew from Las Vegas and Atlantic City. It wasn't easy to attract them, because everyone had to relocate -- and to an entity perceived as failing. ''There was poor management here for an extended period of time,'' Butera told me. ''So we needed to make a lot of changes.''
Revenues have continued to fall at Foxwoods, as they have for the last half-dozen years. But lately, the casino's profits have been increasing. ''We changed our focus to profitability,'' Butera said, which sounds a little like something out of a story in The Onion. (The previous focus was on unprofitability?) But what he meant was that Foxwoods had stopped chasing unproductive customers -- table-game players whose perks added up to more than their losses -- just to increase traffic.
On Feb. 15, the 20th anniversary of casino gambling at Foxwoods, Butera and Rodney Butler, chairman of the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, proposed a broader plan for how the business would go forward. In one way, it was a return to the past. Foxwoods will expand. But this time, in a different way. It will not be adding gambling capacity. Instead, the plan is to build a 300,000-square-foot retail center, including 75 outlet stores, between the new MGM Grand Tower and the rest of Foxwoods. The area is currently dead space, a long walk for a lot of people who don't enjoy walking.
Luxury outlet malls are considered a good mix with casinos, because the core customer is the same as a typical slots player: a middle-aged woman with money to spend. ''It's going to be a fabulous tenant roster,'' Butera said. ''If you're a retailer, what's your biggest concern? You're going to open the store, and nobody's going to come. We've got 40,000 people here every Saturday wanting to do something and not wanting to go anywhere else. They're captive.''
But of course, nothing is really as profitable as the casino end of a resort casino. No goods or services, in a traditional sense, are exchanged. People come through the door for the experience of risking -- and usually losing -- their money. Gambling, like professional sports, is entertainment -- but without the multimillion-dollar salaries for the performers. And no pro sports franchise generates cash hour by hour, day after day, like a big thriving casino.
By the beginning of this year, Butera and the tribe were close to an agreement with their lenders, though the details will still take months to finalize. The $2.3 billion debt is expected to be reduced to about $1.7 billion, but with lower interest rates that will ensure financial flexibility for Foxwoods.
The plan for the outlet mall was a signal to lenders that two decades of grandiosity at Foxwoods have come to an end. Foxwoods had been an early mover, built to stand astride a huge geographic area -- much like the Pequot tribe once dominated a big swath of New England. But as the casino business in America has expanded, Foxwoods's piece of it has become smaller and will continue to shrink.
''You can't fight the tide,'' Butera said as we sat in his office. He brought up the example of Atlantic City. The State of New Jersey is likely to reap less money from its tables and slots -- just as Connecticut and other states that have come to rely on gambling will see their share decrease as others get into the market. But he believes individual casinos with a good plan can survive. ''It's the exact same thing here,'' Butera said. ''We can still have a great business. We just can't have the same business we used to have.''

HEADLINE: Unemployed Is Bad Enough; 'Unbanked' Can Be Worse

BYLINE: By TITANIA KUMEH. 
culture@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Joey Macias has lived without a bank or credit union account for more than a year. To pay his bills, Mr. Macias, a 45-year-old San Francisco resident, waits for his unemployment check to arrive in the mail and then cashes it at a Market Street branch of Money Mart, the international money-lending and check-cashing chain. He keeps any leftover cash at home or in his wallet.
Mr. Macias did not always handle his finances this way. 
''I had a dispute with BofA, so now I come here,'' he said outside Money Mart on a recent afternoon, referring to Bank of America.
Mr. Macias stopped banking after losing his job and incurring debt, which in turn led to bad credit. For now, fringe financial companies -- businesses like check cashers, payday lenders and pawnshops that lack conventional checking or savings accounts and frequently charge huge fees and high interest for their services -- are the only places Mr. Macias can cash his paychecks and borrow money.
Mr. Macias is not alone in his difficulty in maintaining or getting a bank account: 5.7 percent of San Francisco households lack conventional accounts, according to a 2009 survey by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Over the past few years, the issue of ''unbanked'' people has come under increasing scrutiny. In response, Bay Area governments have created a number of programs to increase options for those without accounts.
Lacking a bank account imposes limitations on a person's financial options, said Greg Kato, policy and legislative manager of the Office of the Treasurer-Tax Collector in San Francisco. He said that check-cashing fees at the fringe institutions could total $1,000 a year and interest rates for loans are as high as 425 percent. And there are related issues: those without a bank account cannot rent a car, buy plane tickets online, mortgage a house or make any purchase that requires a credit card.
''Without a checking or savings account, you're basically shut out of most affordable financial services,'' said Anne Stuhldreher, a senior policy fellow at New America Foundation, a nonprofit public policy organization.
According to surveys conducted by the San Francisco treasurer's office in collaboration with nonprofit groups, there are a number of reasons people do not have bank or credit union accounts. These include an inability to afford bank fees, bad credit histories that bar people from opening accounts and being misinformed about the need for government-issued identification to open an account.
Not surprisingly, low-income people are disproportionately unbanked: the national F.D.I.C. survey from 2009 found that about 40 percent of unbanked people in the Bay Area earn below $30,000 a year, and Latino and black residents are most at risk of not having an account. This echoed research from 2008 from the Brookings Institution, a public policy think tank, finding that most of San Francisco's estimated 36 payday loan stores and 104 check cashers are concentrated in low-income, Latino neighborhoods.
The City of San Francisco has two programs meant to help more people open traditional bank accounts. Last year, it started CurrenC SF, a program aimed at getting businesses and employees to use direct deposit. Bank On, a program developed in San Francisco in 2006 and now used nationally, gets partner banks and credit unions to offer low-risk starter accounts with no minimum balance requirements.
But efforts at curtailing the growth of fringe banking have been met with a strange paradox: national banks like Wells Fargo are also financing fringe institutions. The San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, for instance, headed a group of banks giving DFC Global Corp., the owner of Money Mart, $200 million in revolving credit, according to federal filings.
In an e-mail, a Wells Fargo spokesman defended its actions: ''Wells Fargo provides credit to responsible companies in a variety of financial services industries.''
But even with the exorbitant fees and sky-high interest rates, the fringe financial shops do provide much-needed services. Outside Money Mart, Mr. Macias said that he wished banks gave him products similar to the check-cashing operation.
Ms. Stuhldreher agreed.
''There's a lot financial institutions can learn from check cashers,'' she said. ''They're convenient. Some are open 24 hours. Their fees are too high, but they are transparent.''

HEADLINE: An Offer They Couldn't Refuse

BYLINE: By ANDREW RICE

 BODY:
For the last five years, Billy Redmond has been the proud owner of a million-dollar apartment in the heart of Manhattan. ''I've been in it once,'' he said. ''It's lovely!'' We were sitting 3,000 miles away, talking property on a drizzly winter evening, over a pint at a famous Dublin pub called Doheny & Nesbitt. Redmond, a balding and gregarious insurance broker, was explaining his reasons for buying, sight unseen, a condominium unit in a project called the Centria, in a city he had visited only twice, briefly, as a tourist. 
''I don't know New York,'' Redmond said. ''I know Fifth Avenue, that broad strip.'' And he could certainly recognize the glossy image on the cover of the Centria's marketing brochure: the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, which stood right across 48th Street from the lot where a developer was proposing to build 152 apartments, designed to be sold to foreign investors who could rent them in turn to high-end tenants. ''When that thing hit my desk, I saw Rockefeller,'' Redmond said. ''The primary driver behind my making the decision was, it's New York, it's Manhattan, it's Rockefeller -- it doesn't get better.''
Redmond's investment was inspired not just by the neighborhood but also by the neighbors: Irish buyers purchased 75 percent of the units in the 34-story building. It was the height of the ''Celtic Tiger'' boom, which made Ireland, for the first time, a rich nation. For reasons that had as much to do with heritage as with rational calculation, much of that wealth was concentrated in property, and the Centria was a prestige address. Apartment 19E, for example, sold to a developer, Ray Grehan, who cut the most expensive land deal in Ireland's history in 2005. Two floors down were the McCaughey brothers, Gary and Gerry, who had just sold their building company for more than $100 million. Two units on the 21st floor sold to John O'Dolan, who became famous for proposing to construct a miniature Ireland on a resort island in Dubai.
Where the builders went, others followed: bankers, lawyers, publicans, even a pop star -- a member of the Irish folk group the Corrs. ''There was an aura for a particular period of time around certain property developers,'' Redmond said. ''If they were involved in the project, and you're invited in, then you're foolish not to take that offer.'' The concentration of Ireland's new money into one Manhattan investment was so pronounced that one newspaper dubbed the Centria the ''Celtic Tiger Villas.''
To many Irish investors, purchasing an apartment in New York -- a place so many of their forebears had gone in search of work -- made a statement of attainment. Better yet, it seemed like a bargain. In 2007, the year the Centria was completed, the dollar was in the midst of a three-year slide in value, falling 30 percent against the euro. To many people who actually lived in New York, the prices of luxury goods and real estate seemed to be reaching absurd heights, but the city's boutiques were full of Italian-babbling Birkin buyers, and even middle-class Europeans seemed to be capable of paying Manhattan condo prices. New York real estate people talked about a new type of buyer, the ''Irish carpenter.''
During this period, one Manhattan developer marveled to me that he never saw any lights on in his sold-out buildings, because the purchasers all seemed to live overseas. Some foreigners were buying investment properties, to be rented out, while others wanted a pied-a-terre. Some were speculators, hoping to flip for a quick profit. Their interest was self-reinforcing: international investors figured that New York property would hold its value, because someone like them would always want to buy in the city. Veterans of Manhattan real estate, who had seen these waves wash in before -- the oil sheiks of the 1970s, the Japanese tycoons of the 1980s -- knew the outsiders were right, though not always for the reasons they imagined. ''We used to say you could tell where the next financial trouble spot in the world was by who was buying in New York,'' says Adrienne Albert, chief executive of the real estate firm the Marketing Directors.
Albert's adage certainly proved true in the case of the Centria, which she was involved in selling. The Irish high-rise venture in New York, once a lesson in the power of foreign capital, looks, five years later, like the zenith of a communal delusion. ''As a nation,'' Redmond says now, ''we just went nuts.''
Many certainties have been shaken by the economic turmoil of the last four years, but like the audience for ''The Lion King'' or the line outside the Fifth Avenue Apple Store, the foreign appetite for New York's real estate seems immune to the elements. Jonathan Miller, a real estate appraiser, says that ''2011 was the year of the foreign buyer.'' His data suggest that Manhattan condominium prices, down about 8 percent since the market's peak, might have fallen much more if not for enduring international interest.
The foreign buying rationale has undergone almost a complete reversal since the Centria was built. Now it's the euro that is lurching through a crisis, making dollar-denominated investments in New York look comparatively stable. Brokers say they have seen an influx of nervous Europeans, as well as buyers from China and Brazil, which have fast-inflating real estate markets. Recognizing that domestic demand is still fairly frozen, New York's developers are taking their selling efforts global.
Gary Barnett, to cite an extreme example, is marketing his new 90-story tower on 57th Street as a residence for international oligarchs; its two penthouses are currently priced at $115 million. More typical is the condominium complex atop the W Hotel near the World Trade Center site, constructed during the recession, where the developer Joseph Moinian has restarted his sales effort over the last few months. Most purchases in the building thus far have been at prices below $2 million, and Moinian estimates that 90 percent of the buyers were investors from Italy, Turkey, Korea and other foreign nations. Many apartments come furnished, suitable for immediate rental. When the Knicks phenom Jeremy Lin suddenly required a place in Manhattan, that's where he leased.
Richard Steinberg, executive managing director of Warburg Realty, recently returned from a five-day trip to Shanghai, where he marketed five Manhattan buildings at an exposition for the new Chinese elite. ''A New York City condo is a trophy property to anyone in the world,'' Steinberg says. Of course, a broker will always proclaim the Manhattan market's waterproof qualities, however badly the ship may be listing. If ever there were a case to test whether the city's market is truly unsinkable, it would be the Centria. To most New Yorkers, the building is just another anonymous tinted-glass tower -- it was hardly marketed locally at all -- but inside, it's Ireland.
Everyone now knows how the Celtic Tiger boom ended: the clever developers failed, the banks that lent to them imploded and the Irish government was forced to seek an I.M.F. bailout. Irish property values, which more than quadrupled between 1994 and 2006, reversed course, destroying much of the wealth of Irish households. The Irish were never that interested in moving their money into stocks or bonds. Their idea of diversifying, one Dublin real estate executive said, was to shop for property in other places.
''As a nation, it seems to be in our DNA that we like to acquire property,'' says Paul McGennis, a commercial attorney who owns a Centria apartment. Whatever the explanation -- some cite a history of dispossession by the British -- in the roaring years of the mid-2000s the Irish bought in London, bought in Spain, even bought in Bulgaria. They would often band together in syndicates and buy up entire developments ''off-plan'' -- meaning before they were actually built. ''Irish people were well used to getting in early, putting money down, taking the upfront risk and riding that price inflation,'' said Cathal McGinley, an Irish broker. In 2005, McGinley started to export the syndicate model to New York.
I met McGinley for lunch beneath the crystal chandeliers of one of Dublin's finest hotels. ''The taxi drivers outside here have five, six, seven homes,'' he said. ''They might be sorry they did that right now, but that was the investment strategy.'' McGinley said those buying appetites gave New York developers a strong incentive to work with him. ''The idea that somebody could come in, and over a short period of time could sell 20, 30, 50 apartments, get those people into contract straight out of the box,'' he told me, ''that was something that was hugely attractive for any developer.''
McGinley's proposition appealed to Jules Demchick, who was trying to build along a stretch of sandwich shops and commercial buildings on 48th Street. The midblock site was far from any residential neighborhood, but McGinley told the developer that his clients would love its proximity to Rockefeller Center. Because the units would be marketed as investment properties, to be rented out, buyers wouldn't be picky about square footage or frills. ''Amenities, frankly, I don't give a flying you-know-what,'' McGinley said. ''The only thing I was interested in was whether it would rent, and how quickly.''
McGinley's company, KMS Commercial, marketed the Centria through a loose network of subbrokers and personal contacts. ''Word of mouth in the pub is a big thing here,'' says Guy Hollis, head of the Dublin office of the real estate firm CB Richard Ellis. The appeal was discreet, which made it all the more alluring. Buyers were told that they were getting a bulk rate. Sales packets included a spreadsheet comparing the list price for units with a discounted ''KMS price.'' In fact, even with the discount, the average price per square foot of the offered units was around $1,350, substantially above the Manhattan condominium market rate at the time.
The Centria's marketers played up its premier location, though, and its buyers weren't interested in shopping around. ''It was kind of sold as a no-brainer to someone who wanted a quick buck,'' says Declan Coleman, who bought in the building. Friends tipped off friends, business partners pooled their resources, family members picked out adjoining units. For those short of capital, Irish banks made things easy, even offering some buyers collateral-free loans to cover the required 15 percent cash deposit. ''Guys like me had absolute ease of access to cash,'' Redmond says.
As McGinley sold his allotted units in stages, Demchick raised prices, so that later buyers paid substantially more than what he originally asked. Still, the Centria's prices looked like a good deal by the time construction was completed in 2007. Just as the marketers predicted, the Manhattan market had appreciated rapidly. A couple of investors -- including the celebrity, Jim Corr -- promptly resold their units for a profit.
McGinley moved on to marketing even larger Manhattan projects. New York brokers were setting up shop all over Europe, advertising the euro's advantage to a middle-class buying public. ''The trick,'' McGinley said, ''was to get them to make the decision without getting on a plane.''
The Corcoran Group's Anne Marie Moriarty, who made regular expeditions to Dublin, found clients who would sometimes purchase two apartments at a time, based on just a brochure and floor plans. ''I would say 95 percent of my buyers have never seen their properties,'' she told me. In fact, few of the Centria owners I talked to said they had never stepped inside their million-dollar investments. Redmond wanted to check out, at least once, his view of the Rockefeller Center ice rink and Radio City Music Hall. But most others showed little curiosity. Martin Meehan, a Dublin architect, told me that all he cared to see was the large monthly rent check. ''I've no need to go,'' he said. ''Nobody goes to see their stocks.''
The one-bedroom apartment on the Centria's 29th Floor had a sunny view of the Empire State Building and the generic feel of a photo from a furniture catalog. ''This is an example of an apartment with a high-quality corporate tenant, and they have provided the furnishings,'' said Charlotte Van Doren, a senior vice president with Stribling & Associates. She walked me through the snug 630-square-foot unit, pointing out the narrow ''Pullman-style'' kitchen, which could hide behind folding doors -- suitable for the building's largely transient population. Many of its apartments are leased out by companies that offer temporary housing to corporate executives or are used as pieds-a-terre. Van Doren, who handles rentals for many absentees, said she knew of only two owners who actually make the Centria their home.
The unit Van Doren was showing at this open house was up for sale, for $979,000. In the last year, 16 apartments, all owned by Irish investors, have turned over, and another four are now under contract. ''I represent a lot of those owners,'' Van Doren said. ''They need to sell, and they are selling.''
They are being forced into the market by the dire events back home. Manhattan condo prices have stabilized around 2007 levels, but conditions in New York mean little to its owners in comparison to the scale of the catastrophe across the Atlantic. Two years ago, the Irish newspaper The Independent published an investigation into the generous loans bestowed on purchasers in buildings like the Centria, headlined, ''Rich List's New York Shopping Spree.'' Many of the original buyers, so proud of their investment during the boom, have gone silent on the subject.
''I'm in bankruptcy at the moment, so I think it's more prudent that I not comment,'' Ray Grehan said when I reached him on his cellphone. He owes $363 million to an Irish government agency charged with recovering bad bank debts, and it recently sued him in New York, claiming that it was rightfully entitled to the Centria apartment the developer was trying to sell. Several other Centria owners have been named as major debtors. Liam Smyth, the Dublin property magnate who bought the Centria's four penthouse units, owes ten of millions to the banks, and his company has been forced into receivership, according to Irish press reports. He recently put the penthouses on the market, asking $7.4 million.
Out of the public eye, many onetime paper millionaires are facing a newly vigilant attitude from Irish banks about their loan portfolios. Some Centria owners are being pushed by lenders to divest. Many have neglected to keep up with their New York tax obligations, even though they are fairly modest, thanks to an abatement for new construction. Property records show that as of last October, New York City had liens against 21 Centria owners for unpaid bills totaling more than $200,000.
More tragically, in 2010, The Independent named two Centria investors in an article about financially related suicides. One was John O'Dolan, who failed to build Ireland in Dubai and hung himself after telling a priest that he was under ''fierce pressure'' from creditors. The other was Martin Blake, a farmer whose family's business interests had expanded from dairies into building power plants and housing. Blake owned a unit on the Centria's 12th Floor, while his brother and business partner Bruce bought on 29. And as it happened, Bruce was the seller of the unit Van Doren was showing the day I stopped by.
When I reached Bruce Blake by phone at his hilltop estate in rural County Meath, he declined to speak about the property he was selling. But he appeared highly motivated: his asking price was nearly $100,000 less than he paid for the unit. On average, in recent sales, Centria owners have lost about 5 percent on their original investments. ''It's the same old story: if you need cash, you're in trouble,'' says Declan Coleman, who is planning to hold onto his unit.
''I want to wait out the Irish who have to sell first,'' Billy Redmond says. The $4,250 he takes in each month covers his mortgage and maintenance fees, he says, and the Centria has held its value far better than his other investments in Ireland. ''I live in a house that has been devalued by 55 percent in the past three years. I have investment properties in Ireland that have devalued by 80 percent,'' he says. ''So I'm not unhappy with New York.''
For all the distress surrounding it, the Centria has actually delivered on its promise: New York has held its buying appeal. ''The world keeps turning,'' McGinley says. ''The Irish have gotten replaced by someone else.'' In February, Bruce Blake's apartment went into contract for close to his asking price; the prospective buyer is British. The day of its open house, I ran into another new Centria owner, Cynthia Gemmell, who said she was just stopping in to make comparisons. Her family, from Toronto, recently bought a 23rd-floor unit, which they hoped their college-aged daughters would eventually use. The seller, fighting bankruptcy, was a co-owner of a troubled Irish real estate firm involved in syndicating the Centria, and she took a modest loss. ''We're very secure and conservative investors,'' Gemmell's husband, Robert, a retired bank executive, later told me, saying he found the building ''very difficult to beat, both from a lifestyle and a protection-of-capital standpoint.''
Van Doren told me that several other Centria units had been sold to Chinese investors, who she said were ''particularly smitten'' with its proximity to New York landmarks. ''These are like touchstones they can recognize and understand,'' the broker said. Van Doren took me downstairs, to look at the gilded facade of Rockefeller Center through the window of a specially ventilated cigar lounge, designed to increase the building's appeal to international smokers. Then she excused herself, saying she had to keep an appointment with yet another set of prospective buyers, a couple from Brazil.

HEADLINE: Building the American Dream in China

BYLINE: By BROOK LARMER

 BODY:
Daniel Gillen is afraid of heights. The young American architect didn't think to tell me this until we had already climbed up a construction ladder and started walking gingerly across the curved roof of an unfinished building in northeastern China.
It was a frigid day in late February, with temperatures dropping to 15 degrees below zero, and the roof's undulating steel surface made it feel as if we were surfing on a frozen ocean wave -- one that, at this height, promised a very hard landing.
''We'd never get away with this in the U.S.,'' Gillen said with a nervous laugh. 
From the roof, Gillen and I gazed out at a vast new city that didn't exist two years ago. Row after row of 20-story apartment towers radiated out in every direction, in regimented monotony as far as we could see. There were hundreds of towers, almost all of them empty. ''When I first came here two years ago, this area was just a bunch of fields covered with construction cranes,'' said Gillen, who is 32. Now the farmlands outside Harbin have been transformed into one of the dozens of insta-cities rising around China. ''Standing here,'' Gillen said, ''you just have to be in awe of what China can accomplish.''
The building beneath Gillen's black leather boots inspired a different sort of wonder. A whimsical, torquing 660-foot-long tube sheathed in stainless steel, the Harbin Wood Sculpture Museum is the architectural fantasy of Gillen's boss, Ma Yansong, and his team at MAD Architects in Beijing. The building's design evokes the natural world -- an iceberg, say, or a piece of driftwood -- but given its backdrop, I couldn't help thinking that it looked like a shimmering spaceship that had touched down unexpectedly in an alien urban landscape.
In that respect, it is not so different from Gillen himself, whose shaved head, muscular build and thick silver thumb ring make him something of an oddity in this city on China's northern frontier. When Gillen was laid off in December 2008 by Asymptote Architecture, a New York firm, he hunkered down in his Brooklyn apartment, trying to stave off the ''vibe of hopelessness.'' Six months passed. His profession had been flattened by the financial crisis that put an abrupt halt to new construction. Gillen sent out dozens of resumes, but no offers came. Then, in early summer, he spotted a job posting for MAD Architects on a design Web site. The firm's acronym seemed to sum up the outlandish proposition. ''China was not on my radar at all,'' he told me. The starting salary at MAD was half of what he earned in New York. Desperate, Gillen jumped.
Up on the museum's sloping steel roof, his fear under control, Gillen marveled at his good fortune. ''This kind of project,'' he said, ''could not be built anywhere else in the world today.'' Nor could Gillen have found such an opportunity if he hadn't journeyed 6,000 miles from home.
Over the past three years, foreign architects and designers have poured into China, fleeing economic crises at home and pinning their hopes on this country's explosive growth. It is, after all, a place that McKinsey & Company predicts will build 50,000 skyscrapers in the next two decades, the equivalent of 10 New Yorks. MAD's staff consisted almost entirely of mainland Chinese when Gillen arrived in mid-2009; today, nearly half of his 50 colleagues are foreigners, with designers from Holland, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Colombia, Japan and Thailand. ''The economic crisis,'' Gillen says, ''is a heavy factor in everybody's thought process.''
This is the expected global economic formula flipped on its head: instead of American workers losing out to the Chinese, China is providing jobs for foreign architects. Even more surprising is the degree of imaginative license that China offers, even demands of, its foreign building designers. With new cities materializing seemingly overnight, international architects are free to think big, to experiment with cutting-edge designs, to introduce green technologies. All at a frantic pace. In a top-down system that favors political will and connections over regulatory oversight and public debate, large-scale projects in China can be designed, built and put to use in the space of just a few years.
China, of course, is not new terrain for international architects. Many top American firms have run offices inside China for a decade or more. Nearly all of the country's iconic modern buildings have been designed by foreigners, from the National Stadium, known as the Bird's Nest, (by the Swiss firm Herzog and de Meuron) and the gravity-defying China Central Television Tower (by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas) to the 128-story Shanghai Tower (by San Francisco's Gensler), which will be the second-tallest building in the world when it's completed in 2014. The new arrivals, though, come not by invitation or out of curiosity but because they need work. They are, as Michael Tunkey, head of the China office for the North American firm Cannon Design, says, ''refugees from the economic crisis.''
The scale and speed of China's expansion is like nothing these architects experienced in their home countries. Fueled by rising prosperity and the largest rural-to-urban shift in history -- some 300 million Chinese became city dwellers over the past two decades -- the boom has utterly transformed the eastern seaboard around Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The fastest growth now is taking place deep in the country's interior or on its outer edges in cities little known in the West: Harbin, Changsha, Chengdu and dozens of others. ''It's still shocking to me,'' says Manuel Sanchez-Vera, a 43-year-old architect who shuttered his own Madrid practice two years ago and joined a midsize Australian firm in Shanghai. ''I just got out of a meeting to design a hospital for a city that will grow from 4 million to 10 million in the next few years. How do you design for an explosion like that?''
The answer to that question, in the main, is quickly and cheaply. While some marquee projects -- like the Harbin museum Gillen is working on -- attract a lot of attention, most foreign architects in China are designing office towers, housing developments, hospitals and shopping malls, projects in which creativity is in constant tension with the bottom line. Despite the excitement over the flow of projects -- indeed, the mere existence of work -- there is also a deeper concern: all those empty apartment buildings in Harbin and elsewhere suggest that China's building boom may have passed its peak.
For now, though, Gillen sees no better alternative. ''I'm an architect, I like to build,'' he says. ''And China is a place where things get built.''
In December 2008, right around the time Gillen joined the ranks of the unemployed in Brooklyn, another young American architect lost his job in San Francisco. Adam Mayer, then 26, received his pink slip one year after joining Skidmore, Owings & Merrill.
The rejection stung. Mayer, a glib and gregarious University of Southern California graduate, had long aspired to work at SOM -- a blue-chip firm whose San Francisco office was not far from his family's home in Silicon Valley. Unlike Gillen, though, Mayer saw no point in sending out resumes or nursing the hope of an economic recovery. ''I didn't even bother looking for a job,'' he told me. ''All my U.S.C. friends were hitting a brick wall, and the only projects on SOM's drawing boards seemed to be in China. So I just bought a ticket to Beijing. I had nothing to lose.''
Mayer spoke no Mandarin. And, like many designers, he had not yet passed the arduous set of exams needed to obtain an architect's license in the states. ''Legally, in the U.S., I can't call myself an architect,'' Mayer said. ''But in China, it doesn't matter.''
Four months after arriving in Beijing, Mayer landed a full-time position at a large Singaporean firm with offices around China. The one catch: Mayer had to move to Chengdu, the capital of southwestern Sichuan Province and the front line of the Chinese government's Develop the West campaign. About 300 Chinese staff members filled the large open space of the company's Chengdu office. Only a handful, mostly Chinese with overseas passports, spoke English. Besides Mayer, there was just one other Westerner, a young Argentine designer.
During his year at SOM in San Francisco, Mayer worked primarily on one building, and his role was subordinate. But his bosses in Chengdu were asking him to prepare conceptual designs for a series of huge projects: a 1.5-million-square-foot redevelopment zone in central Chengdu, a vast new residential area for China's biggest housing developer, even a new headquarters for Chengdu's urban-planning bureau. ''I had a ton of creative freedom,'' Mayer says. ''If you ask architects coming out of grad school, they all say they want to be conceptual designers. So it was great at first.''
The pace was relentless. From designing one or two projects a month, Mayer was soon being pushed to produce one large-scale conceptual design every week. ''The deadlines were crazy,'' Mayer says. ''Sometimes we'd have three days to finish a 250,000-square-meter project.'' Even so, his Chinese colleagues churned out even more. ''In terms of pure production, the local staff could work faster and more efficiently than anything I've ever seen in the U.S.,'' Mayer says, even if in some instances they saw no shame in ''literally copying designs right out of a book.''
Creativity was supposed to be Mayer's job. Like most foreign architects in China, he was hired with the expectation that he would give designs an innovative edge -- along with the prestige that many Chinese still associate with a foreign name. (More than once, Mayer was invited to sit silently at client meetings, even when he knew nothing about the project under discussion.) Mayer helped create some stunning designs, including a plan for a state-owned publisher's headquarters that drew inspiration from ancient Chinese scrolls. Still, the mantra was always ''Bigger, bolder, flashier.'' During one meeting at the urban-planning bureau, Mayer recalls an official who implored them, ''Make us a landmark that will stand out and make people notice!''
The question of whether China can innovate looms over the country's quest to move beyond its role as the world's factory. In architecture, Mayer says, the problem is not simply an education system that stresses technical skills over abstract thinking but also the pressure cooker that compels developers to build as fast and as profitably as possible. For all the lip service given to creativity, he says, too often the results are cookie-cutter developments that make Chinese cities feel depressingly similar -- and surpassingly ugly. ''To come up with something new and creative takes time,'' he says, ''and in China, there's not the luxury of time.''
One morning in February, Gillen showed me around MAD Architects' open-plan studio in Beijing, which occupies the top two floors of a defunct printing plant in a narrow alleyway. Rows of Chinese and foreign architects were working in an almost sepulchral silence, surrounded by models of their fanciful projects: on one end of the second floor, there was a twisting, layered skyscraper designed for Chongqing, on the other a swirly cross section of an opera house and a performing-arts center whose construction Gillen was also overseeing in Harbin.
Occupying the studio's central space, however, was a common Chinese totem: a Ping-Pong table. Not long ago, Gillen, an avid player himself, organized an officewide tournament, with an iPad going to the champion. It wasn't quite Ping-Pong diplomacy, but the event served to bring the local and foreign staff members closer together.
When Gillen made his blind leap into China, he knew very little about MAD except that its founder, the 37-year-old Ma Yansong, was a rising talent. Ma, who trained at Yale and apprenticed with the British architect Zaha Hadid, is celebrated as the first Chinese architect to win a foreign competition: the Absolute Towers in Toronto. He was proof that China was coming into its own as a creative architectural force. (Further evidence came recently when the 2012 Pritzker Prize -- architecture's top honor -- was awarded to another Chinese architect, Wang Shu.)
Ma and Gillen sit a few feet apart, at identical workstations, but the rolls of blueprints that make a sort of miniature skyline on the American's desk show the role he has taken on. Hired as a designer, Gillen now oversees the building of Ma's architectural concoctions. ''I am the executioner,'' he says with a grin. ''I just try to get things done without making either my boss or the client unhappy.''
The client, in the case of the Harbin Wood Sculpture Museum, is the local government, which occupies a glass building with a red Chinese flag next door to the construction site. ''The top-down system can make things very simple,'' Gillen says. ''The leader says, 'I want it; you make it,' and it's done.'' Never mind that the projected ticket sales for the museum's exhibitions, which are anchored by the collected works of a locally renowned wood sculptor, could never match the building's extravagant price tag.
Such an issue might stop a project in the United States. But in China, the primary concerns are prestige and development for its own sake, and the leaders would move heaven -- and lots of earth -- to get the museum built. ''These projects are the Louis Vuitton bags of architecture,'' says one foreign architect, who has worked on several marquee buildings in China. ''Every city in China wants one now.''
With all the excitement over architectural possibilities in China, there is a reluctance to address the obvious question: What happens if the social, cultural and economic environment cannot support these cutting-edge designs after they are built? This is already a problem, both for prestige projects and massive urban developments. MAD, for example, has built the voluptuously curved Ordos Museum in a new planned city in Inner Mongolia. But the real estate bubble popped in Ordos last year. The museum now sits forlornly in an empty development, a symbol of architectural achievement as well as the folly of ambition. ''These are like the Fields of Dreams,'' Gillen says. ''Build it, and they will come.'' Sometimes, though, they don't come.
In Harbin, I met two Chinese men in thick coats wandering around the Wood Sculpture Museum. They were trying to decide if it looked more like a whale or a shimmering serpent. ''It certainly is unusual,'' said one, who identified himself as Mr. Wang and who bought an apartment in one of the high-rises behind the museum two years ago. Did he like the design? ''Well, yes,'' he said, ''because it's already made my property nearly double in value!''
Gillen is not paid to worry about the museum's future or its development value -- just to ensure that it is built. And that often requires handling shifting demands that would be almost unimaginable back home. When the pit for the wood-sculpture museum's foundation had already been dug, for instance, the government made a startling request to double the area to 66,000 square feet. The demand meant drafting a new set of designs and digging the foundation several yards larger to create a new underground gallery space. ''In the U.S., the contract would've been ripped up and renegotiated,'' Gillen said. But MAD complied with the request without complaint. It was another lesson in the Chinese art of making guanxi, or cultivating relationships. Who knows what commissions a cooperative attitude might lead to in the future?
Walking through the museum's cathedral-like interior, with rays of morning sunshine streaming through the skylights, Gillen snapped photos of imperfections: a shattered pane of curved glass, a poorly placed water pipe. He was keenly aware of the shoddy workmanship that has plagued other modern buildings in China. It is one price of excessive speed. ''I want to build a monument that lasts,'' he says. Even so, he couldn't get over the pace of progress. ''This is a complex project, but we've gone from design to nearly finished construction in just two years!'' Gillen said. ''I'm not saying this system is better than ours back home. But sometimes it seems like the U.S. is sitting on the couch sipping coffee while China is Carl Lewis running as hard as it can.''
It was nearly 1 a.m. on a weeknight in Chengdu, but a band was playing at China Groove, and the expatriate architects seemed in no hurry to leave. Clustered around a table on a night in mid-February were newly arrived architects from Germany, New Zealand and Britain, as well as a young Iranian construction supplier just in from Tehran. The music was blasting, and the young men (yes, a large proportion of the foreign architects in China are men) had to yell to make themselves heard.
''Have you seen the world's biggest building yet?'' shouted Stephan Wurster, an affable 38-year-old Stuttgart native who moved here in December after three years in Beijing. Both he and Kamaljot Singh Panesar, a goateed British architect at the table, have offices in development zones mushrooming on the plains south of Chengdu, not far from a half-completed behemoth called Ocean Park. Under a single roof covering an area of about 25 football fields, Ocean Park is designed to include hotels, shopping malls, aquariums, amusement parks and a simulated ocean with a white-sand beach. (The ultimate ''Truman Show'' touch: the 660-foot-wide video screen that will allow beachgoers to enjoy brilliant digital sunsets, even when clouds and pollution block the real thing.)
Wurster takes more than a passing interest in the Chinese-designed building: it stands directly across from the site where he is overseeing construction of a contemporary art center for his bosses at Zaha Hadid Architects. The same Chinese investor behind Ocean Park, in fact, is financing the arts center as a gift to Chengdu. And what city leader wouldn't be flattered to receive a cultural icon designed by a world-famous architect? Still, Hadid's firm has had to make compromises -- overhauling the sinuous design because local officials thought it looked like a snake, which is considered bad luck. ''Even on status projects,'' Wurster said with a laugh, ''there's no carte blanche in China.''
The hidden rules and restrictions are felt even more strongly by the vast majority of foreign architects who are not working on high-visibility projects. Consider Panesar. The financial crisis devastated his boutique firm in London in 2009, forcing him and his partner at Urban Hybrid Architecture to lay off most of their 15-person staff and take a gamble on China. Dapper and soft-spoken, Panesar, who is 35, has spent the past 18 months scrambling to get his foot in the door with all kinds of projects in Chengdu: train stations, kindergartens, residential developments. So far, he has pulled in enough design fees to keep his firm afloat. But he's still waiting for one of the designs to actually be built. ''China is not the blank canvas that you imagine,'' Panesar said. ''We're just crawling really, but we're here for the long haul.''
There was one expat missing that night at China Groove. Adam Mayer, now 29, left his job in Chengdu a few weeks earlier and flew back to California to figure out his next move. ''I built up a great portfolio of designs,'' Mayer told me when we talked by Skype. ''But I started to wonder what good it served.'' None of his designs were built. For all the creative freedom he enjoyed, Mayer began longing for stronger mentoring and more concrete results. In some cases, clients were using his work to impress officials in hopes of winning a bid or acquiring land for a future project. (In China, all land is owned by the state.) ''I feel as though I was more in advertising or marketing than architecture,'' he said.
Mayer's experience is not universal. But many foreign architects in China sense that they are operating in the dark, toiling in a system they dimly understand. Real estate development in China is a murky business. There is little transparency -- and lots of horse trading -- in everything from the acquisition of land to the awarding of bids and competitions. In all but the highest-profile projects, foreigners are largely sidelined during the building process itself, which by law and tradition is controlled by local design institutes.
As foreign architects continue to arrive, there is also increasing competition for jobs and business. Some international firms have even started lowballing bids to try to buy their way into the market -- a development that is ''killing Western firms here,'' says the Shanghai-based Dutch architect Daan Roggeveen, who is the co-author of a book on China's new megacities. In the meantime, Chinese and foreign firms alike are moving to localize their staffs -- both to cut costs and to cultivate a new generation of Chinese architects, many of whom have trained abroad.
''I'll definitely go back to China,'' Mayer said. For now, though, he is too busy cramming for the exams that will allow him, at last, to call himself an architect in the United States.
A few miles from the wood-sculpture museum near Harbin, a far bigger cultural landmark is rising on the banks of the frozen Songhua River. When it is finished, the Harbin Cultural Island -- the MAD-designed opera house and performance center I saw modeled in the office -- will look like a trio of snow-swirled mountains. Gillen was checking on the progress. ''Three years ago,'' he admitted, ''I'd never even heard of Harbin.''
As we clambered to the top of this construction site -- those heights again -- it somehow made sense that Gillen's planned year in China had extended to almost three. In his previous job at a New York firm, he said, ''I spent a year and a half doing concept designs that never got built.'' When I asked him how long his China sojourn might last, he smiled: ''How's the New York real estate market doing?'' As the winter sun hung over the horizon, Gillen walked around the half-completed opera house -- ''a baby being born,'' he called it -- and added: ''I'm in a lucky position. I don't know if the pace of growth in China is sustainable, but I'll ride it as long as I can.''

HEADLINE: Path for a Housing-Aid Plan Runs Through a Tangle of Competing Interests

BYLINE: By MATT SMITH. 
msmith@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
San Francisco civic leaders are bickering over new subsidies for affordable housing in the most expensive city for renters in the United States.
Mayor Edwin M. Lee, who made affordable housing a key issue in his election campaign last fall, convened a series of meetings beginning in January to devise a plan for replacing tens of millions of dollars in housing subsidies that the city lost when Gov. Jerry Brown dissolved redevelopment agencies across the state last year.
For Mr. Lee, this issue is personal; he got his start in public life as a legal advocate for immigrant renters.
''Housing is one of his top priorities,'' said Christine Falvey, Mr. Lee's spokeswoman. ''He campaigned on it, and now he has worked very successfully in his first year as mayor in bringing different people together to shape a policy.'' She added, ''A policy that has broad support.'' 
But with a May objective for producing ballot measures to raise money for new housing subsidies, Mr. Lee's Housing Trust Fund Work Group seems to have served mainly to demonstrate that, while everybody purports to oppose high rents in this city, they cannot agree on how to solve the problem.
The people Mr. Lee has gathered for his Trust Fund Work Group represent some of San Francisco's most fiercely oppositional interest groups. They include nonprofit developers, builders of high-rise condominium buildings, builders of small apartment buildings, managers of city-subsidized housing complexes, and smart-growth environmental advocates.
Although the group has not reached consensus on how to come up with more housing subsidies, one thing is clear: With the recession, budget cuts and downturns in local construction and real estate industries, there may be so many interests competing for pieces of a potential housing trust fund that they could undermine plans to pass a ballot measure to pay for it.
''You can't say 'let's carve out housing' and expect it's going to be a simple thing,'' said Peter Cohen, co-director of the Council of Community Housing Organizations, which lobbies on behalf of nonprofit housing developers. ''There are union contracts. We're entering into the budget season. There are people raising concerns about employees. There's tension. The city's general fund is not big enough for everything.''
The simple solution -- asking voters to approve new taxes earmarked for subsidized housing -- is viewed as impractical in the current political climate, because specific-use taxes require two-thirds approval. So the participants in the mayor's Housing Trust Fund Work Group are considering, among other ideas, a strategy to raise tens of millions of dollars in annual housing subsidies -- first through a ballot initiative to increase taxes on the sale of existing properties, and then by passing a second ballot initiative that would allocate those revenues specifically to subsidize housing costs for lower-income residents.
In 2008, and again in 2010, city leaders floated the idea of raising taxes to pay for more housing subsidies. In both instances, tax increases passed at the ballot box, but plans to earmark the money for housing foundered. The money went into the city's general fund, where it was pounced upon by a variety of other interests.
Like most cities, San Francisco has been hurt by the recession. Job growth has long outpaced the number of housing units being built, and an economic recovery will only worsen the imbalance.
According to California's Employment Development Department, the counties of Marin, San Mateo and San Francisco hosted 952,100 jobs. Meanwhile, the 2010 U.S. Census counted just 659,187 housing units in those three counties.
During the 1990s and 2000s San Francisco permitted about one-third of the housing units that would have been required to keep pace with population growth, according to the city's Planning Department. And the Association of Bay Area Governments predicts that by 2030 the Bay Area will add 1.4 million jobs, yet will add only 605,000 new housing units.
As a result, at the end of 2011 an average two-bedroom apartment in San Francisco rented for $3,267 per month, up from $2,840 a year earlier, according to the real estate services firm Cassidy Turley. In March, the National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group, proclaimed San Francisco to be America's costliest city for rentals.
Building enough housing to meet demand is politically difficult in a city whose population density is the highest in the western United States. Further complicating matters is the city's tradition of community activism. The Planning Department has counted more than 400 neighborhood organizations and related groups, many formed over the years to battle against housing project proposals that came and went. The city must usually negotiate with these groups when new construction is proposed.
So, politically, the trick for San Francisco politicians has been to favor reduced rents without actually proposing to build enough new apartments to meet demand. As a result, political discussions about housing tend to focus on low-income housing subsidies.
The city's realtors have already circulated flyers objecting to the idea of a new tax on property sales, called a transfer tax.
San Francisco Supervisor Scott Wiener has proposed routing more subsidies toward middle-income residents, which in San Francisco can mean people earning $90,000 per year.
Randy Shaw, executive director of the nonprofit Tenderloin Housing Clinic, said he backs the mayor's plan to raise money for new subsidized housing. But Mr. Shaw said he believes around $7 million of the money should be used to increase the salaries for employees of all nonprofit housing agencies in the city. ''There really is enough money there,'' Mr. Shaw said. ''We need to look at housing, but along with other priorities.''
Many of the city's labor unions, meanwhile, are in contract negotiations and are seeking more money from the city's general fund, the same source of money that housing advocates hope to tap.
Sean Keighran, president of the Residential Builders Association, a local construction trade association, said he favors new housing subsidies but would like to see an end to local rules that require his members to pay for subsidized units in every building they make. ''The industry needs some relief,'' Mr. Keighran said. ''Unemployment is 30 percent in construction.''
S. Osborn Erickson, chairman of the Emerald Fund, a local developer, said any deal involving a transfer tax increase must include an easing of a city requirement that 15 percent of the units in any apartment project be subsidized by the developer to make them affordable to lower-income tenants. The key to reducing rents, Mr. Erickson said, is encouraging market-rate housing construction.
''If you're just going to raise the transfer tax, that just makes it more difficult overall to provide housing,'' he said. ''If, however, it's coupled with reducing affordable requirements, that's a way to do it where everybody wins.''
Mr. Cohen, whose organization's members have sometimes supported neighborhood-improvement groups in opposing market-rate housing projects, countered that the city should allow developers to build apartments only after the city has extracted the maximum possible fees to pay for subsidized units.
Mr. Shaw, who says any deal must set aside millions for his workers, said he does not believe the mayor will allow the Trust Fund discussions to be held hostage by any one faction. ''This is not going to happen here because the mayor won't tolerate it,'' he said. ''And that's why I'm confident of a positive result here.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the Housing Trust Work Group, whose members are discussing proposals to raise money for housing subsidies in San Francisco, paraphrased incorrectly from comments by Randy Shaw, executive director of the nonprofit Tenderloin Housing Clinic, about how $7 million of the money the city/mayor wants to raise should be used. Mr. Shaw said the money should be used to increase the salaries for employees of all nonprofit housing agencies in the city, not just for the employees of his agency.

HEADLINE: In Havana, Family-Run Dining Goes Upscale

BYLINE: By VICTORIA BURNETT

 BODY:
ON a mild January night, the unlighted street in the artsy Havana neighborhood of Vedado was quiet and filled with shadows. But as my companions and I climbed the steps of Le Chansonnier, the glow of chandeliers gleamed invitingly through the wrought-iron windows, and a low burble of music drifted onto the street.
Inside, we sipped tangy mojitos in the bar before settling down to a dinner of spicy crab and tender pork loin with eggplant, in a dining room whose simple banquettes and white tablecloths struck a chic balance with the soaring archways and molded ceiling.
This may not sound like a typical Cuban dining scene, and in many ways, it's not. Decades of Communist rule have produced a host of state-run restaurants where, all too often, tourists struggle with leathery pork chops and try in vain to catch the attention of a surly waiter. 
But a new crop of privately owned restaurants, known here as paladares, is bringing a dash of style -- not to mention enticing food -- to Havana's normally lackluster dining scene.
The paladares are blooming just as the trickle of American visitors to Cuba has grown to a steady stream, following the Obama administration's decision last year to lift some restrictions on travel to Cuba. After a clampdown under George W. Bush, Americans may now travel in ''people-to-people'' tour programs, which encourage contact with Cubans.
Such itineraries usually include stops at the capital's better state-run restaurants, like El Aljibe, where you can get a roast-chicken dinner, or El Templete, which serves overpriced, Basque-style food on a breezy terrace at the edge of Old Havana.
But tour group schedules leave some mealtimes open, offering the chance to explore the paladar circuit and meet some of Cuba's budding entrepreneurs.
Paladares, which are usually family-run restaurants in people's homes, first appeared during the post-Soviet economic crisis of the 1990s, when the government, briefly and grudgingly, allowed some private businesses to take root. Many, however, either failed to thrive or were pushed out of business by officious inspectors. Some survived, among them La Guarida, a hugely popular restaurant that serves some of the city's best food in a bohemian garret atop a magnificent, decayed, early 20th-century palace.
When the Cuban government opened the door to private enterprise again 15 months ago to help invigorate the struggling economy, hundreds of Cubans leapt at the chance to set up a paladar, this time with more faith that the government would let them thrive.
Hector Higuera Martinez, for example, spent tens of thousands of dollars, from savings and friends, transforming the living room and bedrooms of what had been a guesthouse in his gorgeous 19th-century mansion into Le Chansonnier, which opened in October. The dining rooms display the work of local artists, including a found-metal collage of old oil and paint cans by Damian Aquiles, a friend.
But keep in mind that this is Havana, not New York: the paladar scene is limited and relies on a client base of expats, tourists and the few Cubans who have access to foreign currency and can pay prices that are well beyond the pockets of most islanders. And in a city where you can spend a day or two hunting for eggs, restaurateurs contend with blackouts and poor supplies and rely on visitors to bring in everything from Parmesan cheese to foie gras.
''It's a headache,'' said Mr. Higuera, who trained under Erasmo, a well-regarded Cuban chef, and has lived in Paris. ''You dream up a recipe that you'd like to make but then you can't find the ingredients. One day you go out to get salt and there's no salt. And I mean no salt. Anywhere.''
Oyaki Curbelo and Cedric Fernando ask visitors to bring spices from abroad to help feed diners at their Nuevo Vedado paladar, Bollywood, whose small menu offers a mix of Indian and Sri Lankan dishes, including a piquant shrimp curry with ginger and tamarind. Mr. Fernando, an Englishman with Sri Lankan roots, gets curry leaves from a tree at the Sri Lankan embassy, whose chef taught the Bollywood staff the secret of his coconut roti bread.
On the same wavelength as Le Chansonnier in terms of style, if not food, is Atelier, housed in the Vedado mansion of a former Cuban senator and also decorated with Cuban art. The Continental-style cuisine is uneven but the roof terrace, dotted with candles and cushions, is a lovely place to enjoy a glass of wine under the starry Havana sky.
If you want to mingle with artists and movie types, have a drink at Madrigal, the loft-style bar (and home) of the filmmaker Rafael Rosales. There, you can sip a head-splittingly cold daiquiri (the tapas -- cheese empanadas and tomato bruschetta -- are forgettable) to a smooth soundtrack of jazz and R&B.
''I wanted a completely different kind of space,'' said Mr. Rosales, who named the bar after a Cuban movie on which he worked with Fernando Perez, a well-known director. ''If one person opens a cafe, the neighbor opens a cafe. Everyone here does the same thing.''
Most organized excursions to Havana include some time to wander the picturesque colonial maze of Old Havana, where a great place to stop for authentic Cuban ''ropa vieja'' -- shredded beef prepared with garlic, tomato, oregano and bay leaves -- is Dona Eutimia. This friendly, bustling paladar just off the Cathedral Square is named for the woman who, for years, produced hearty meals for the artisans at a nearby workshop.
Only a few restaurants exploit Havana's location on a glittering stretch of the Atlantic. One is Vistamar -- a longstanding paladar that offers garlicky grilled lobster tails and thick slabs of lemon pie topped by a heap of silky meringue -- where you can book an outdoor table with a view of the water.
Across town in Vedado, at the penthouse terrace of Cafe Laurent, you can gaze across the rooftops to the sea as you dine on meatballs with sesame seeds and mustard in a red-wine and tarragon sauce or a plate of sticky rice with seafood.
And for a change from the soggy, tasteless wedges of dough that pass for pizza on many a Cuban street corner, there is La Carboncita, whose genial Italian chef serves up crusty brick-oven pizzas, generous plates of homemade pasta and barbecued meat on the patio that surrounds his 1960s house.
Mr. Higuera of Le Chansonnier said he hoped that as more paladares open and grow in variety and ambition, they will help shake off the island's reputation for boring food.
''I believe we can play an important role in revolutionizing Cuban cuisine,'' he said. ''We need fusion. We need spice. We need contrasting flavors,'' he added. ''Not just rice and beans and roast pork.''

HEADLINE: Whit People

BYLINE: By CHIP BROWN

 BODY:
Looking more like a wayward preppy trying to get into the Harvard Club without a tie than a legendary indie filmmaker mounting a comeback, Whit Stillman limped up to a RED digital camera and peered at a set dressed to resemble a girl's dorm at a coed liberal arts college. This was back in October 2010. Since the start of the month, Stillman had been leaving his Manhattan sublet before sunrise and commuting to Staten Island, where, amid the banana trees and Greek Revival architecture of the Snug Harbor Cultural Center and Botanical Garden, he was shooting ''Damsels in Distress,'' his first movie in 12 years. Dressed in khakis, a white shirt and a blue blazer, Stillman was in some distress himself, having strained the plantar fascia of his right foot running in loafers for a subway train. He would be 59 in January -- more than twice the age of most of his cast and crew -- and given his perfectionist tendencies in the editing room, he would surely be 60 by the time the movie was released. ''I don't like to say I'm pushing 60,'' he said. ''I prefer to say I'm pulling 59.''
Satisfied with the setup, Stillman limped back to the monitor and slipped on a pair of headphones. 
''Quiet!'' shouted the assistant director, Curtis Smith. ''Roll sound!''
''Rolling,'' said Mikhail Sterkin, the sound man.
''Action!'' Stillman said.
''Damsels in Distress'' follows four college girls, Heather, Lily, Rose and Violet, as they grapple with problems ranging from love troubles to toxic frat-house odors and suicide attempts by education majors who insist on throwing themselves off two-story buildings. (''If they can't even destroy themselves, how are they going to teach America's youth?'' Rose asks.) The students at Seven Oaks, the fictional college, have a lot in common with the preppies and patricians of ''Metropolitan'' (1990), ''Barcelona'' (1994) and ''The Last Days of Disco'' (1998), the autobiographical trilogy that prompted reviewers to call Stillman ''the WASP Woody Allen'' and ''the Dickens of people with too much inner life.'' They grope for direction but are seldom lost for words, and beneath their barmy crotchets and pretentious dissertations there's heartache and yearning. Stillman is the knight-errant of sneered-at bourgeois values. He extols the overlooked merits of convention and the hidden virtues of the status quo. Inveighing against ''cool people'' and the social cachet of ''uniqueness, eccentricity, independence,'' the transfer student Lily asks: ''Does the world really want or need more of such traits? Aren't such people usually terrible pains in the neck? What the world needs to work properly is a large mass of normal people -- I'd like to be one those.''
Even the frat-house dolts who provide a counterweight of broad comedy -- the character Thor can't identify colors because he skipped kindergarten -- aren't belittled for their simple-minded aspirations. What Stillman captures best are people who aren't quite adults but are no longer children: bewildered fledglings of beleaguered traditions who have a mostly abstract grasp of suffering, an often-preposterous belief in their own moral integrity and an optimistic faith that their destiny is part of a divine plan -- ideally one of God's.
Stillman watched as Scene 24 unfolded on the monitor. The film's main character, Violet, played by the lauded young star Greta Gerwig, was defending a guy at a bar who'd sent drinks over to Lily and another student.
''He was probably just yearning for some intelligent discourse,'' Gerwig said. ''He could see that Alice and Lily are college students. College students are well known for their interesting conversation. After all, they can talk about their courses. That's probably what attracted him -- ''
''Nonsense,'' said Megalyn Echikunwoke, who was playing Rose with a fluty British accent.
''His aspirations were perhaps even loftier -- to court Lily, with a view to matrimony. We're in the North, but occasionally a Southern gentleman will wander into these parts.''
''Rubbish.''
When the scene finished, Stillman said: ''That's really great. Can we do it again?'' He asked Echikunwoke: ''Can you do a 'nonsense' with more oomph? More like your 'rubbish.' ''
She nodded.
''Quiet,'' Curtis Smith shouted.
On the brink of action, Stillman spotted a hair malfunction on one of the actresses and sprang up to fix it, plantar fascia be damned. He began to plump one of the bunk-bed duvets. That glare on the top bunk -- could someone black it out with a Sharpie please? And then he took after a fly on the set, trying to bat it out of the scene with some wild forehands. He limped back to the monitor, shaking his head.
''Chasing flies, fixing hair -- I think I'm showing off,'' he confessed. ''Normally on my movies there's no direction at all.''
Nothing could be further from the truth, of course, but wry self-deprecation is one of the hallmarks of the well-bred WASP, and Stillman is a museum-quality specimen. Which you might expect of a man whose godfather, the sociology professor E. Digby Baltzell, always gets credit (inaccurately) for coining the term ''WASP.'' Even in unbuttoned Los Angeles, Stillman adheres to the preppy uniform of loafers, jacket and tie. He speaks briskly, carbonating his conversation with the same daft esoterica that bubbles up in his scripts -- everything from the influence of Scrooge McDuck (''the only true role model for kids in rich families'') to the sexual practices of medieval French heretics known as Cathars.
''I think Whit is painfully sincere and open about stuff most people aren't,'' says Chris Eigeman, who starred in Stillman's first three movies and is more closely identified with his work than any other actor. ''When 'Metropolitan' came out, all the principals went to the Cannes Film Festival. We were all sitting in a French restaurant, and the waiter was really making Whit uncomfortable. I was dying trying not to laugh, and he looked over at me and said, 'It's O.K. to laugh at me.' ''
Stillman remains as adept at confounding expectations as he was in 1969, when, a Harvard freshman, he escorted a debutante to the Junior Assemblies ball at the Plaza Hotel in New York with a Students for a Democratic Society button tucked under the lapel of his white-tie-and-tails. His preferred place to write is Dunkin' Donuts. He says he has no assets but finds having no assets to be ''pathologically exhilarating.'' His having no assets is, in and of itself, confounding given his lineage of prosperous sea captains, merchants and bankers, including his great-grandfather James Jewett Stillman, the president of National City Bank and one of the richest men in America when he died in 1918. The legacy left to John Whitney Stillman of Generation 10 was old-money culture minus the old money. Plus some inside material about the Stillman clan he used for his Harvard thesis, ''Ten Families,'' on the lack of dynastic control in American family-run companies.
''Metropolitan'' and ''Barcelona'' earned nice profits, but ''The Last Days of Disco'' lost a bundle. And yet you get the impression Stillman could live with ''Damsels in Distress'' languishing at the box office (the movie opens in New York on April 6) if the trade-off was that the ''sambola,'' which he and the choreographer Justin Cern created to fulfill Violet's dream of starting an international dance craze, actually became an international dance craze.
With his eccentric view of eccentricity, Whit Stillman resembles nothing so much as a character from a Whit Stillman film. He is the cast member who is obsessed with social codes and cliches, who covers hurt and hard feelings with a wicked wit. He may not, like so many of his characters, proclaim eternal devotion to principles he betrays 20 minutes later, but he does change his mind a lot and can be hard to pin down vis-a-vis deadlines and field trips proposed by journalists. He is a creature of comic contingencies and contradictions, not the least being that when he's writing, he craves the society of the film set, and when he's behind the camera, he covets the countertop at Dunkin' Donuts.
Amid the racket of opinionated characters, it's not easy to discern what Stillman himself believes. In ''Damsels in Distress,'' the genial undergraduate Charlie (played by the ''O.C.'' star Adam Brody) expounds on the ''decline of decadence'' and developments in homosexuality, which in his view used to be ''something refined, hidden, sublimated, aspiring to the highest forms of expression and often achieving them'' but now ''just seems to be a lot of musclebound morons running around in T-shirts.'' Stillman says it's Charlie's opinion, not his, though he does regret the eclipse of the dandy tradition of Oscar Wilde.
''What I like and find liberating in dialogue comedy is that the characters, and what they say, are not me,'' he explained in a recent e-mail. ''These are fleeting thoughts and observations and not presented as truths but as something that illuminates the character and the dynamic between the characters. This kind of dialogue is thesis and antithesis -- and we never get to a synthesis.''
There is some folly in conflating a writer with his characters, but conservative commentators have championed Stillman for his defense of ''traditional'' values, while liberal ones have attacked him for reactionary priggishness (and might well cite Charlie's argument as an example -- the implication being that the price of freeing gay men from the closet was too high because it produced a surfeit of illiterate beefcake). For his part, Stillman, who broke with his father's Kennedyite liberalism in college and avowed conservative views in print in the 1980s, now says he is loath to be drawn into ideological debates and would like to remain ''apolitical'' -- so much so that he asked me not to mention the name of the conservative magazine, now called The American Spectator, where some of his polemical humor pieces appeared.
Breaking for lunch on set at Snug Harbor, Stillman carried a plate of pasta and salad to the communal table in the production dining area. Since returning to New York in 2010, he has lived like a hermit crab, scuttling from sublet to sublet. ''I've always wanted to live out of two suitcases,'' he said.
Without sighing too heavily, he took up the topic of the hiatus in his film career. After ''The Last Days of Disco,'' he moved from New York to Paris in August 1998, with his wife, Irene Perez-Porro, and their two daughters, Ann and Isabel. (Ann, now 25, is a lawyer in Dublin; Isabel, 20, is studying pre-med at Columbia University.) He published a ''novelization'' of his ''Disco'' script, ''The Last Days of Disco With Cocktails at Petrossian Afterwards.'' In 2002, he and his wife separated; Stillman found an apartment in the same building on the Ile Saint-Louis and saw his daughters regularly. He wrote several original scripts, including one set in Jamaica in the 1960s, which he still hopes to make, and he was involved in a bunch of projects that didn't work out. As he recently told an interviewer at the Toronto Film Festival, he lost track of his ''destiny as a self-produced filmmaker.''
Stillman had been making notes on ''Damsels'' for years before he mentioned the idea, in 2006, to Liz Glotzer and Martin Shafer at Castle Rock Entertainment, which had financed his last two movies. ''Whit said, 'I want to write a movie about four girls in a dorm who are trying to keep things civil in an uncivil world,' '' Shafer said. ''It took him a year to write 23 pages. Six months later, a few more dribbled in. He just doesn't work very fast. Finally we had a draft. When we started production he said, 'I think 12 years is the right amount of time between movies.' ''
Having seen other projects bog down or collapse, Stillman was resolved to return to the fast, insurgent auteur style of his debut hit, ''Metropolitan,'' which he started shooting even before he finished briefing himself with the book ''How to Make Movies.'' ''I love making cheap films,'' he said. 'Metropolitan' was shot for about $225,000, which included $10,000 from his mother, who has happily recouped 10 times her investment. In contrast, the budget for ''The Last Days of Disco'' was around $8 million, and it is still in the red. The budget for ''Damsels in Distress'' is much leaner, around $3 million, according to Shafer, who advanced the lion's share and who admires Stillman's frugality almost as much as his writing.
''Whit is so much cheaper than I am,'' he says. ''We were going to fly him out first class for a meeting. He said, 'I can't fly first class if I'm going to make this movie.' He flew coach. His first bill for location scouting was $13.42.''
As lunch was winding down, Stillman filled a cup with coffee from a Dunkin' Donuts Box O' Joe. He spotted a dime on the floor. ''Money!'' he said reaching for the coin. ''I can finance my next film!''
Ten years after his graduation from Harvard, Stillman dispatched a note to the Class of '73 Tenth Anniversary Report. Where fellow classmates were crowing about their blessed lives, Stillman, then 31, had only a paltry item to contribute: ''I am still building up momentum but will have more to report for the next edition.'' That it was taking him longer to find his footing owed mostly to the sea change in his life that followed the breakup of his parents' marriage, an ordinary catastrophe that had the extraordinary effect of severing him from his father and the family's financial legacy but that offered as compensation a wealth of material that eventually became the autobiographical comedy of his debut film.
Stillman was born in Washington, D.C., in 1952, the youngest of three. His mother, Margaret (Meg) Riley, was from Philadelphia; his father, John Sterling Stillman, was a lawyer and a liberal Democratic official in the Commerce Department under John F. Kennedy, who was a classmate of his at Harvard. The family regularly went up to Cornwall-on-Hudson, the town where Charles Stillman, Whit's great-great-grandfather established a country residence in the mid-19th century.
''Cornwall was like a big studio back lot,'' Stillman recalled. ''We had a small farm operation, my uncle and my father supported the farm and a whole bunch of houses. There were woods and glens, 180-degree views of the Hudson River. We built forts, we played war round the clock.''
Stillman adored his father. After the family moved back up to Cornwall, he traveled around with him during his unsuccessful bid for a New York State Senate seat in 1958. On weekend afternoons they went to the movies. They re-enacted Waterloo and other famous battles in the Avalon Hill war-games catalog. Stillman assumed he would be a lawyer like his father, until he discovered -- the night of his Harvard admissions interview -- that that wasn't what he wanted at all.
In 1965, his parents split, and his father soon remarried. When relations between the children and their new stepmother soured, Stillman's father took his new wife's side. Meg Stillman removed her kids to New York. Thirteen-year-old Whit watched a lot of television and brooded about what he would later characterize in ''Metropolitan'' as the ''untrammeled malevolence '' of stepmothers. ''It concentrates the mind at that age when you have an enemy just because you are the child of someone else,'' Stillman recalled. ''I think the best feeling you get is that 'This is the hand you've been dealt.' You have to disengage. You have to accept it and not fret about it. I could see what the dynamic was. My father was a man of institutional loyalties. He became my stepmother's attorney. He was like a lawyer with a bad client.''
Offsetting the wound of his father's neglect was the attention of an uncle on his mother's side, Ted Riley, who had a business representing cartoonists and illustrators that Whit eventually took over. The Riley side not only gave Stillman his sensibility and humor but also provided a godfather in the person of Uncle Ted's best friend, Digby Baltzell. ''Uncle Ted adored us kids,'' said his sister, Linda, a New York-based artist. ''He was like a surrogate parent to us.''
When Stillman went off to Harvard in 1969, he was ''morbidly depressed'' but found a cure in the deb circuit parties over Christmas break. His arguably un-WASPy love of dancing dated back to the mixers he attended as a student at the Millbrook School, but he never had much formal training, apart from a year of classes in fourth grade, some in Washington, plus a session with the dance instructor from the RMS Queen Elizabeth, courtesy of Uncle Ted.
At Harvard, recalls his sophomore-year roommate Russell Pennoyer, ''all his relationships were like little plays. Whit had an elephantlike memory and a VCR running in his head all the time.'' He worshiped F. Scott Fitzgerald, wrote a couple of shows for the Hasty Pudding that were not accepted and published articles in the college newspaper, The Crimson. He graduated in 1973 with about $2,000 to his name -- money he managed to accumulate from summer jobs and small gifts from relatives. ''I wasn't a trustafarian; I never had any money from the Stillman family. But I'm happy not to have had Stillman money. The divorce and the reduction in our economic level was very tough, but as bad as it was, we were still comfortable.''
After graduation Stillman went to work for the book publisher Doubleday. He saw his father four times a year for lunch at the Harvard Club. When he was 27, further tensions with his stepmother curtailed even that limited contact. In 1990, the rift widened when ''Metropolitan'' had its premiere with its barbed allusions to stepmothers and poignant tropes of paternal abandonment -- notably the box of his toys that the protagonist Tom Townsend finds outside his father's apartment (a scene based on Stillman discovering that his father and stepmother had thrown away his toys at the house in Cornwall).
''I think Dad was very upset by 'Metropolitan' and the scene where the toys are put out on the street,'' Linda Stillman said. ''But it was the perfect metaphor for how we felt.''
The hard feelings were softened by ''Barcelona'' in 1994. ''What finally got my father to speak to me again was massive amounts of Castle Rock advertising surrounding the release of 'Barcelona,' '' Stillman said. His sister had given his father a copy of the script to read while he was recuperating from heart surgery. And it didn't hurt that Whit was quoted saying stepmothers hadn't gotten their due and he was contemplating a film with a stepmother as the heroine.
What's striking when Stillman talks about his father is the tenacity of love and idealization in a gray-haired son still seemingly determined to put the best face on the moral frailty of an adored figure. It seems almost as if his refusal to condemn reflects the long reach of the wisdom embedded in a confession Stillman's great-grandfather, the Scrooge McDuck of what is today Citibank, is said to have made late in his life: ''I ought to have praised more; I ought to have been kinder.'' Friends of Stillman's have speculated in print that his conservative views were forged in a Freudian crucible that drove him to reject the liberalism of the father who rejected him. ''I just wanted to form my own identity,'' Stillman said, dismissing the interpretation. ''I didn't want to hate Republicans, Episcopalians or country-club types out of some rigid, schematic anger. I wanted to go with my own associations and not judge people based on their political or economic views.''
Any lingering bitterness between father and son was resolved during the five years when Stillman's father moved into a nursing home in New Canaan, Conn. ''In the last years of his life, Whit was fantastically devoted to Dad, and Dad showed that he cared for us,'' Linda said. Stillman took the train up from New York on frequent visits. He helped his father at mealtimes. They watched football games and programs on the History Channel. When his father dozed off, Stillman sat in the room and wrote. He turned in the script for ''Damsels in Distress'' on Christmas Day 2009. Three weeks later, Jan. 19, 2010, his father died in nearby Norwalk Hospital at the age of 91.
The last day of shooting for ''Damsels in Distress'' was Nov. 5, 2010. The final scene in the script was filmed weeks earlier, when the Snug Harbor oaks were in full leaf. All the principals in the cast had danced around the grounds, frolicking past banana fronds and the copper fountain with the spouting statue of Neptune. Greta Gerwig and Adam Brody had climbed into the pool and splashed through a tap routine on a submerged platform as a recording of Fred Astaire singing ''Things Are Looking Up'' boomed over speakers. Stillman discovered the song, which was written by George and Ira Gershwin for the 1937 film ''A Damsel in Distress,'' when he began working on his script. He was so inspired by its upbeat lyrics and Astaire's airborne rendition that he built the movie around it, praying he could afford the licensing fee.
Things are looking up
It's a great little world we live in
Oh, I'm happy as a pup
Since love looked up at me.
It wasn't until a month before production began that the rights were secured. ''It was one of those magical permissions that are like an open sesame for the whole film,'' he said.
Now it was Day 28, and filming was nearly done. The wardrobe department was selling off surplus clothes and shoes. Sitting on a bench under bare branches by the empty fountain, Echikunwoke and Gerwig were trying not to shiver in thin dresses; assistants hovered out of frame ready to drape coats over them between takes.
Stillman had drafted a scene that morning to clarify Rose's back story, to pre-empt complaints from sticklers who might object to Echikunwoke's accent when the film was released in Britain, and to provide the film with its ''theology.''
''Action!'' he said.
''I just miss my nice American friend,'' said Gerwig.
'' 'Nice,' '' said Rose, caricaturing a nasal American as Stillman requested. '' 'Nice.' I want to be nice. 'Fine.' Those are not the adjectives I like to use. The Lord gave us abilities -- he requires that we use them: 'Good. Better. Best. Excelsior! Higher!' Only excellence can glorify the Lord. Vulgarity is, in essence, blasphemous.''
Scenes were shot all afternoon and into the evening after a catered dinner: odds and ends, inserts, pictures of soap bars on the ground, close-ups of Gerwig's hand taking class notes.
At 9:46 p.m., Stillman hurried in with two lines he wrote that morning.
''All right, the faster we do this, the quicker it'll all be over,'' Curtis Smith said.
''Action!'' Stillman said.
''I detest Parfit,'' said Echikunwoke, with bred-in-the-bone conviction.
''I agree,'' Gerwig replied.
''Cut!''
''What is Parfit?'' Smith asked. ''Some kind of dessert?''
Nobody, including the actors, had any idea what Parfit was. Or to put it properly, who Parfit was, for Parfit was not a dessert but the renowned ethicist and philosopher Derek Parfit, white-haired author of ''Reasons and Persons,'' whose vogue among academics Stillman found irksome.
''You want to do one more?'' Smith said after a few takes.
''Sure.''
Persons unsure of their reasons fired a final volley at poor Parfit.
''Cut,'' Stillman said. ''That's great, that works.''
He whisked off his headphones, already suspecting Parfit would be left on the digital equivalent of the editing-room floor. It was 10:11 p.m.
''That's a wrap?'' Echikunwoke asked.
''That. Is. A. Wrap!'' Smith cried.
''Oh, my God, we're actually at the end!'' said the co-producer Charlie Dibe.
''Bravo, damsels!'' Stillman said. Everyone applauded. Stillman wrestled the cork from a bottle of Veuve Cliquot, and plastic cups of Champagne were passed around.
The last hurrah was the cast party two nights later at the Wooly, a club in the Woolworth Building in Lower Manhattan. Stillman looked particularly dapper in a gray pinstriped suit and Ralph Lauren club-collared shirt. He wouldn't take no for an answer, dragging would-be wallflowers onto the dance floor as songs from the film's soundtrack rattled the bar glasses.
''Every day was like going into battle,'' Gerwig said. ''The script pages were chock-full of dialogue. But I do remember a moment when I felt like I had ownership of Violet. It was so many little things, like how she runs. She runs in small steps with her arms alongside her. She always has an opinion, and she's always ready for her opinion to be wrong.''
As the evening crested, the tune came on that Stillman set the sambola to. He led the liquored-up crowd through the steps, then vaulted onto the stage and seized a microphone.
''This is ground zero of a new dance craze!'' he cried.
In the morning he was sick with the flu. A week passed before he could bring himself to think about the film. Over the next six months, Stillman and the film editor would go through every take of every scene -- two terabytes of footage. At the outset, he could only hope the raw material they'd amassed at Snug Harbor would eventually resemble the movie he envisioned. Or better yet -- ever upward! -- something better.
One day mid-January 2011, six weeks into the editing of ''Damsels in Distress,'' Stillman was hunched beside his film editor, Andy Hafitz, staring at two monitors in a rented office in Lower Manhattan. The day before, he showed his backers a rough cut, and to his relief, they liked what they saw. Now he was poring over scenes, looking for places to make the movie shorter and more artful.
''With 'Disco,' I looked at every take by myself, but now I prefer to watch the scenes with Andy,'' Stillman said. ''If I'm watching alone, the performances don't resonate.''
They were working on Scene 37. Stillman decided he'd fallen down on the job not getting enough takes of Debbie, played by Aubrey Plaza, grilling Violet about whether she is clinically depressed. He'd already enlarged Plaza's role by restoring cut scenes. On the monitors, Plaza was demanding to know, ''Have you been to a clinic?'' Gerwig shook her head no. Plaza said, ''Then you're not clinically depressed!''
''I played a lot of the scene on Greta,'' Hafitz said.
''Can we look at 37, Take 3? Stillman asked.
Hafitz put it up on the screen.
''No, there's a moment where Greta is looking for her line,'' Stillman said unhappily.
''Here's Take 2.''
''I like that.''
''And 1.''
''The framing is bad. Could we cut back into a wide shot -- would that work?''
''I don't think so,'' Hafitz said.
Stillman turned to me and said brightly, ''See, you can also make scenes worse!''
In late February and March, he began to screen the movie for small audiences of friends.
''There's a lot of Whit in the character Violet,'' said his old college roommate Russell Pennoyer after one screening. The part seemed deeper on film than it had in the script. In the editing room, Stillman and Hafitz shifted the focus onto what Gerwig's character didn't know and couldn't say, heightening Violet's silences with reaction shots so that all her postulates and opinions seemed only to reinforce what was broken and ineffable in her life.
At a second screening in early March, Stillman tensed up when he saw Sony executives, who would be marketing and distributing the film, checking their BlackBerries. In June he screened the ''locked'' picture for the first time -- ''locked'' meaning he wasn't supposed to fiddle with the running time, which he'd trimmed from 120 to 98 minutes. He was nervous that night too; his daughter Isabel was in the audience with two friends, and he worried they were too young to get the joke Violet makes about staying in a Motel 4 because it was even cheaper than a Motel 6.
Later that summer, ''Damsels in Distress'' was screened at the Venice and Toronto Film festivals. The first reviews were enthusiastic. Stillman was still living in a sublet, but his plantar fascia had healed, and -- how to put it? Things were looking up. Momentum was building. A new Whit Stillman movie was poised to open in April in New York and L.A. Around the time of his 60th birthday in January, he sent an e-mail: ''I'm taking off for Dublin and the Rotterdam film festival -- back a week later. We should probably chat before you write too much -- everything I told you was a lie.''

HEADLINE: Gulf Widens Between U.S. and an Increasingly Hostile Karzai

BYLINE: By ROD NORDLAND, ALISSA J. RUBIN and MATTHEW ROSENBERG

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The Americans in Afghanistan are ''demons.''
They claim they burned Korans by mistake, but really those were ''Satanic acts that will never be forgiven by apologies.''
The massacre of 16 Afghan children, women and men by an American soldier ''was not the first incident, indeed it was the 100th, the 200th and 500th incident.''
Such harsh talk may sound as if it comes from the Taliban, but those are all remarks either made personally by the United States' increasingly hostile ally here, President Hamid Karzai, or issued by his office in recent days and weeks.
The strongest such outburst came Friday. ''Let's pray for God to rescue us from these two demons,'' Mr. Karzai said, apparently holding back tears at a meeting with relatives of the massacre victims, and clearly referring to the United States and the Taliban in the same breath. ''There are two demons in our country now.'' 
Ever since the Koran-burning episode on Feb. 20 and its violent aftermath, the relationship between the two governments has lurched from one crisis to another. American officials have scrambled to run damage control, with President Obama expressing a personal apology for the Koran burning, as well as regrets about the massacre, while calling Mr. Karzai twice in the past week.
The White House went to lengths last week to depict Mr. Karzai's call for Americans to hand over control a year earlier, by 2013, as no change in policy -- only to have Mr. Karzai pointedly insist the next day that it was. The Americans fret that Mr. Karzai is making a difficult job almost impossible, with demands they often see as unreasonable; Mr. Karzai worries that the Americans seek to undermine him, and may yet abandon his country and him, once again, to their fate.
The Koran burnings brought these differences into sharp relief, and led to a rupture in trust some view as irreparable. After an American unit at Bagram Air Base inadvertently burned Korans, embassy officials were deeply worried about an investigation conducted by the country's Ulema Council, its highest religious body.
The council's pronouncements, however, are closely controlled by Mr. Karzai's office -- they are even issued by the presidential palace -- and American officials were assured by senior members on the president's staff that the council's report would be tough but not incendiary.
''We were ready to get knocked a bit,'' said an American official who asked not to be identified to preserve his relationship with Afghan officials. ''We messed up pretty badly.''
The original draft, in fact, was relatively moderate, American and Afghan officials said. But at the last minute more hard-line elements of Mr. Karzai's staff weighed in, and the joint statement finally issued by the Ulema Council and the palace used language like ''Satanic act'' and ''unforgivable, wild and inhuman'' about the book burnings, and ''justifiable emotion'' in regard to the violent reaction, which claimed the lives of at least 29 Afghans and 6 Americans.
Western diplomats have often viewed Mr. Karzai's outbursts as playing to the galleries, meant for consumption by his own people only, not as serious statements of policy. But the galleries also include the public in the United States and its NATO allies, where majorities in nearly every country oppose remaining in Afghanistan, and every new contretemps risks further eroding an already tenuous support.
''I think this is very serious because Mr. Karzai has always had a very ambivalent attitude toward the West and toward the war -- he has never really believed violence is the answer,'' said Sir Sherard Cowper-Coles, the British ambassador to Afghanistan from 2007 through 2009. ''He is also very conscious and very resentful that his political survival and even perhaps his personal safety depend on the Americans.''
The current American ambassador, the veteran diplomat Ryan C. Crocker, was brought out of semiretirement by President Obama last July at least in part because he had known Mr. Karzai since the beginning: Mr. Crocker was the first envoy to Afghanistan after the invasion that defeated the Taliban, when Mr. Karzai was appointed interim leader here.
Like many of his predecessors, Mr. Crocker began his latest tour on an optimistic note. ''President Karzai has the toughest job in the world, and he has been doing it for the last 10 years,'' Mr. Crocker said early on, and has repeated often since. ''You have to give him credit.''
While the two men still have a working relationship and meet often, according to aides to both, there are many signs that the warmth has gone out of that relationship once again.
Mr. Crocker insisted in an interview with PBS on Friday that this was not the case.
''I think he is a committed Afghan nationalist, that at the end of the day he seeks the same goals we do,'' the ambassador said. ''And sometimes the rhetoric gets a little heated. Sometimes my rhetoric has been known to get a little bit heated in a few of these meetings, and then I go sit under a tree and think about the larger equities at stake, and we move on.''
From Mr. Karzai's point of view, the Americans have repeatedly defied his demands to end commando night raids, and one civilian casualty after another has put him in the position of either criticizing the Americans and angering them, or not criticizing them and angering Afghans.
''In any relationship there are things that one party does that the other party doesn't particularly care for, and that goes both ways,'' said James Cunningham, the deputy ambassador to Afghanistan. ''The question is not just whether President Karzai is a partner; we're discussing and putting into place a partnership that is going to look forward a decade or so, and that's a partnership with Afghanistan and its leaders, whoever they are.''
The relationship is so frayed, however, that Mr. Karzai often is quick to view everything through the prism of presumed American perfidy.
When American diplomats meet with his political opponents, he sees it as a sign that they are out to topple him from power -- something that has reportedly obsessed him ever since the presidential election in 2009, which the international community saw as widely fraudulent. American officials pressured him into agreeing to a runoff, which in the end his opponents refused.
''We don't have to be here running Afghanistan, and that is what people are afraid of,'' Mr. Cunningham said. ''We are not running Afghanistan, we are easing our way out, and I think that's what feeds this whole dynamic. The notion that somehow we hold the upper hand, that's not the right way to look at what we are trying to arrange. We are really, actually trying to arrange a partnership in which Afghans run their affairs,'' he said.
The Taliban routinely deride Mr. Karzai as nothing more than an American puppet, but that is certainly not the view of his purported puppet masters. ''Never in history has any superpower spent so much money, sent so many troops to a country, and had so little influence over what its president says and does,'' one European diplomat marveled.
Americans have, however, wielded influence on many occasions, and President Karzai is still smarting from many of them. When an aide to Mr. Karzai was arrested by an American-backed corruption task force, the president intervened to secure his release, and then eviscerated the anticorruption body, the Major Crimes Task Force. But from Mr. Karzai's point of view, the Americans never gave him the courtesy of warning that they planned to arrest a top official.
Bette Dam, a Dutch author who interviewed Mr. Karzai extensively for her book, ''Expedition Uruzgan: Hamid Karzai's Journey Into the Palace,'' says that what the Americans saw as corruption, Mr. Karzai and his family saw as simply patronage. Because the government was weak, with the Americans providing all the muscle, patronage was the only thing Mr. Karzai had to maintain his power base.
''Then you have President Obama, who says we have to do it differently. But the only thing that changed was Obama criticizing Karzai, making his government transparent, setting up task forces openly attacking his corruption,'' she said. ''It was not likely something would change; Karzai's patronage system that was built up was too strong, and he himself too proud.''
The inquiry over the apparent embezzlement of nearly a billion dollars from Kabul Bank, which implicated Mr. Karzai's brother and the brother of his first vice president, was deeply embarrassing, and he blamed American officials for leaking it to the press -- and then using the threat of aid cuts to force him to dismember the bank.
From the point of view of the United States and its Western allies, they have only been trying to push Mr. Karzai to do the right thing. The Kabul Bank swindle was so notorious that it risked chasing away foreign aid donors.
From either perspective, it is a less-than-ideal situation -- but the Americans have no alternative to Mr. Karzai, and Mr. Karzai has no alternative to the American-led coalition supporting him.
''The Americans are prepared to walk away,'' said a senior Western official in Kabul. ''And you've got an Afghan political establishment that is heavily dependent on the international presence. It's a dynamic that is very unfortunate.''
''Karzai wants revenge on the U.S. because of the systematic insults he has suffered, that he feels his family suffered, because of Kabul Bank,'' said a former Afghan government official. ''The culture in the U.S. is about policy, it is about mutually rational interests. Revenge is at times more important in this part of the world, more important than any political or economic interest.''

HEADLINE: Obama Sets Gas Prices? Just Another G.O.P. Myth

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. SEMPLE Jr.

 BODY:
Jeff Bingaman, chairman of the Senate energy committee, complained the other day of ''widespread misunderstanding'' about rising oil prices. He was being senatorially polite.
The issue of gas prices has not only been misunderstood but thoroughly distorted by relentless ideological spin from industry and its political allies, mainly Republican. Hardly a day goes by that some industry cheerleader somewhere -- be it Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana or Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma -- does not flay President Obama for driving up oil prices by denying the industry access to oil and gas deposits and imposing ruinous environmental rules. Senator John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, said last week that Mr. Obama should be held ''fully responsible for what the American public is paying for gasoline.''
If only the president had the power to give us $2.50-a-gallon gasoline, as Newt Gingrich promised to do if he got to the White House. It is ridiculous to think that a president can. 
One can sympathize with consumers feeling the pain of higher gas prices. But the fundamental truth is that those prices are tied to the price of oil, set by world markets. There are peaks and valleys, but their causes -- a worldwide recession, an embargo or conflict in the Middle East -- are beyond the control of any one country. As the chart below shows, gasoline prices rise and fall in the same pattern throughout the world. Americans historically pay much less at the pump because they pay lower taxes; when the price of a gallon spikes at $3.70 in the United States, it is closer to $8 in, say, Germany.
Because oil is a global commodity, increasing domestic production will do very little to bring down retail prices, although it does help narrow the trade deficit as America spends less on imports. On this score, America is doing much better than the Republicans will admit. In 2005, oil imports accounted for nearly 60 percent of America's daily consumption. In 2010, for the first time in recent memory, imports were less than half of consumption, and last year, imports were only 45 percent -- 8.6 million barrels a day of the 19 million consumed. There are two reasons for this welcome shift: production is up and oil consumption is down. Production of crude oil and other liquid fuels, onshore and offshore, reached about 10.3 million barrels daily in 2011, its highest level since the late 1980s.
Some of the biggest discoveries have occurred on private land in deep shale formations in Texas and North Dakota, and production on federal land is beginning to boom, too. The real issue, which industry's allies never mention, is whether the oil companies are fully exploiting the federal resources they already control. Mr. Bingaman notes that 7,000 approved onshore drilling permits have been sitting unused by the companies that own them, and that millions of acres under lease in the gulf remain unexplored.
The most encouraging news is on the consumption side. Americans are getting more miles to the gallon, which means there's that much less carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere. We used 20.8 million barrels a day in 2005, the highest level in history. That dropped to just under 19 million barrels last year, and, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, is likely to stay there awhile. The recession has had a lot to do with the decline, but so has fuel efficiency. Ten years ago, cars and light trucks (including S.U.V.'s) averaged 24.7 miles a gallon. In 2011, the figure rose to 29.6 miles a gallon as consumers chose more efficient cars. Two landmark agreements between the administration and the automakers -- aimed at improving efficiency and reducing greenhouse gases -- could raise it to 55 miles per gallon by 2025.
Despite this progress, ending dependence on foreign oil seems as remote as when President Richard Nixon proposed it. With developing countries like China and India demanding more petroleum, prices are likely to stay high. That's reality -- no matter what the Republican spinners say. Only a rounded policy mix of greater fuel efficiency, steady production and the aggressive development of alternative fuels can protect American consumers against what could be even greater price shocks in the years ahead.

HEADLINE: For GMC, 100 Years of Hard Labor

BYLINE: By TUDOR VAN HAMPTON

 BODY:
TO many people shopping for new vehicles, there is little to differentiate the trucks sold by Chevrolet and GMC beyond the logos on the grilles. But to collectors, GMC holds claim to a hard-working personality distinctly its own.
''Up until the late 1950s and into the '60s those were mostly work trucks,'' said Donald E. Meyer, 80, a GMC historian in Lake Orion, Mich. ''They were used rough and put away wet.''
In its formative years, GMC catered almost exclusively to farmers, contractors and freight haulers, building a line of trucks that emphasized utility and dependability over comfort or style.
''GMC sold small trucks as an accommodation to their big-truck buyers,'' said Rob English, 58, a collector in Sheldonville, Mass., who has an enthusiast Web site, www.oldgmctrucks.com. ''Chevy was a car company that moved up to the light-truck business. GMC backed into it.'' 
Chevy trucks, which outsold GMC models by more than two to one in 2011, are easier to find on the road and in collectors' garages. That makes GMCs, in some cases, all the more valuable. ''I think the GMC brand is little more refined,'' Mike Flynn Jr., owner of Hollywood Wheels Auctions and Shows in St. Petersburg, Fla., said. ''It's also a little more rare.''
The GMC nameplate first appeared in January 1912 at the New York auto show, then held at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, after General Motors had combined several of its truck brands. A popular myth held that Max and Morris Grabowsky, brothers who in 1902 formed one of those brands, the Rapid Motor Vehicle Company, supplied the ''G'' in GMC. The truth is less colorful, according to Mr. Meyer: the letters simply stand for General Motors Corporation, the new company's parent.
GMC's early days focused on big trucks for commercial customers; the year of its first light-duty pickups is not easily pinned down. Though the company offered an Express Body truck in the mid-1920s that resembled a pickup, it had a wooden cargo box. It was not until 1936 that GMC produced what experts consider a modern pickup, an all-steel half-ton model called the T-14, which cost $566.
Early marketing campaigns promoted the durability of the trucks. In 1927, Erwin Baker, better known as Cannonball for his many high-speed motoring stunts, drove a two-ton GMC tanker filled with water from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. In the course of his nearly 3,700-mile trip from New York City to San Francisco, Baker averaged 27 miles an hour over five days and 17 hours, never slowing for a breakdown.
Early GMC trucks ''will drive down a two-lane back road at 35 miles per hour, and they will do it for decades,'' said Mr. English, who in 2007 made his own cannonball tribute drive in a Brewster Green 1951 pickup that he restored.
''I have done a reasonable amount of long-distance travel in this truck,'' Mr. English said, adding that he had the truck trailered back to New England after the trip. ''I had it out of my system by the time I got there.''
GMC continued to build trucks in a variety of body styles until 1942, when production was interrupted by World War II. During the war, GMC built more than 528,000 CCKW trucks, a two-and-a-half-ton model that was commonly called a deuce-and-a-half. Soldiers would refer to this 6-wheel-drive workhorse as a Jimmy. That name was borrowed for GMC's first midsize S.U.V., introduced in 1970 as a counterpart to the Chevrolet Blazer.
GMC's wartime production also included more than 21,000 amphibious variants of the CCKW, called the DUKW -- the so-called ducks that delivered the troops storming the beaches in the Normandy invasion. Many remain in use as tourist attractions.
By the 1950s, the transformation of the pickup from work truck to lifestyle vehicle was beginning, and the lines between Chevy and GMC began to blur. In 1955, GMC offered a new breed it called Blue Chip trucks, replacing the previous generation that began in 1947.
The restyled line included the GMC Suburban Pickup. The thickly chromed truck looked similar to Chevrolet's Cameo Carrier, though it was powered by a Pontiac V-8 instead of the Chevy small-block V-8. For many collectors, this model is the ultimate GMC.
''They only made 1,000 GMC Suburban Pickups,'' said Ralph Wescott, 75, a brand devotee in Largo, Fla., who sold a set of 10 vintage GMCs at a Hollywood Auctions sale in West Palm Beach last year.
The centerpiece of Mr. Wescott's collection was the 1957 GMC Palomino, a one-off Suburban Pickup built for auto shows. Designers dressed it up with a gold-and-cream paint scheme and a sumptuous leather interior. Rolling on its original tires, with just 9,900 miles on the odometer, it brought $194,400.
By 1967, GMC and Chevrolet light trucks began rolling off the same assembly lines. There were subtle differences, though, including a special V-6 that GMC introduced in 1960.
''It was only used for a few years, and it was only for the GMC trucks,'' said Michael Goodfellow, a GMC collector in Honeyville, Utah, who runs the Web site 6066gmcguy.org, a forum for enthusiasts of the 1960-66 era.
''The V-6 was the last generation of GMC trucks that were differentiated,'' added Arthur Throckmorton, 52, an enthusiast in Las Vegas who owns a 1960 half-ton pickup that he restored.
Some blame the engine's tough-as-nails reliability for its downfall.
''They were just too good,'' Mr. Meyer, the GMC historian, said. ''They were more expensive to make than the Chevy V-8s and the fuel economy was not as good, but boy, they lasted forever. I know of V-6s that went over 400,000 miles without an overhaul.''
More modern GMCs should not be overlooked, collectors say. High-performance variations like the Syclone small pickup and the Jimmy-based Typhoon have devoted followings, and the appeal of good-condition GMC pickups from the 1970s and '80s is increasing -- as is the demand for parts.
''New old-stock grilles can go for $800 for just a grille in a box,'' said Jeff Drew, 38, of Coon Rapids, Minn., who runs the Chevy-GMC enthusiast site 73-87.com. ''Supply and demand is kicking in, and everything is going up.''
Compared with the past, GMC today may seem as though it is in cozy retirement, offering pampering options like the Denali package, introduced on the Yukon full-size S.U.V. in 1999.
In the last decade, GMC designers have sought to break away from the brand's image as an upscale Chevy and reposition it as ''professional grade.'' The company does this mainly through sheet metal changes and upscale trim.
GMC's design studies also have forecast pickup trends. Elements of the 1999 Sierra Professional concept's mobile-office interior inspired later designs. The 2000 Terradyne concept, whose knife-edge styling cued up the latest generation of G.M.'s half-ton pickups, was the first to carry a Duramax diesel engine and Quadrasteer four-wheel steering. Those features went into production, though the latter was short-lived.
But the brand is thriving, having jumped in sales 31 percent in 2010 and another 16 percent in 2011. GMC is its parent's second-top-selling nameplate, and nearly half of GMC's recent sales have gone to what the company calls conquest consumers, or buyers who would not normally consider G.M.
Still, many die-hard enthusiasts look longingly on the truck brand's earlier times, Mr. Throckmorton said.
''It was a different time, a different era, a different animal,'' he said.

HEADLINE: That Wishful Thinking About Tax Rates

BYLINE: By CHRISTINA D. ROMER. 
Christina D. Romer is an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and was the chairwoman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.

 BODY:
AT least since Calvin Coolidge, politicians have trumpeted the supply-side benefits of cutting marginal income tax rates. Lower rates will unleash economic growth and the cuts will largely pay for themselves -- or so it's often said. Yet careful studies find little evidence of such effects. Perhaps it's time to reform tax policy based on facts, not worn-out assumptions.
A family's marginal tax rate is what its members pay to the government if they earn another dollar. If the government takes a smaller chunk of that dollar, a family has more incentive to earn it. Workers may choose to work additional hours, or a stay-at-home spouse may decide to work outside the home. Likewise, entrepreneurs may invest in a new enterprise or expand an existing one. Lower marginal rates also reduce people's incentives to shield income from taxes, through legal and illegal means. 
The main question is whether these incentive effects are large. If they are, cutting marginal rates could cause a sustained surge of hard work and entrepreneurial activity -- and thus reported income. This idea was the essence of President Ronald Reagan's theory of supply-side economics, and his justification for large, permanent tax cuts in the early 1980s. Mitt Romney, now seeking the Republican nomination for president, cited a similar argument when he proposed cutting all income tax rates 20 percent.
If the incentive effects are small, however, the situation is very different. Cutting taxes would still raise output for a while by putting more money in people's pockets, and so increasing their spending -- a temporary demand-side effect. But lower marginal rates wouldn't greatly raise output over the long haul through the supply side.
History shows that marginal federal income tax rates have varied widely. Since World War II, the top rate has ranged from less than 30 percent (at the end of the Reagan presidency) to more than 90 percent (throughout the Eisenhower years). The 1964 Kennedy-Johnson tax cut significantly reduced the typical marginal rate paid by American families, but rates rose greatly over the next 15 years as inflation pushed people into higher tax brackets. Rates fell sharply under President Reagan, rose under President Bill Clinton and fell again under President George W. Bush.
If you can find a consistent relationship between these fluctuations and sustained economic performance, you're more creative than I am. Growth was indeed slower in the 1970s than in the '60s, and tax rates were higher in the '70s. But growth was stronger in the 1990s than in the 2000s, despite noticeably higher rates in the '90s.
Of course, many factors affect the economy, so a lack of correlation doesn't prove that marginal-rate changes have little impact. That's why economists have devoted thousands of pages in journals to testing the effects more scientifically.
ONE standard approach is to look for natural experiments in the tax code. Often, a law changes the marginal rate for one group and not others. For example, the 2001 Bush tax cut lowered marginal rates sharply for married couples with taxable incomes of around $50,000, but did little to rates for couples earning slightly less. Using household survey data, economists can compare the behavior of taxpayers whose rates did and didn't change.
A useful summary measure of such changes' supply-side effects is the sensitivity of reported income to marginal rates. If people work and invest more in response to tax cuts, their reported income will rise when marginal rates fall. True supply-siders believe that this sensitivity is well over a value of 1, implying that cuts in marginal rates raise reported income enough that government tax revenues nevertheless rise. But a critical review of several natural-experiment studies concluded that the best available estimates of this sensitivity range from 0.12 to 0.40. The midpoint of the range, 0.25, implies that if the marginal tax rate for high earners decreased from its current level of 35 percent to 28 percent (which Mr. Romney proposes), reported income would rise by just 2 1/2 percent.
In a new study, David Romer and I found that changes in marginal rates in the 1920s and '30s had even smaller effects. (Mr. Romer is my husband and a colleague at Berkeley.) The rate shifts in that era make those after World War II look tame, and varied greatly across income groups. The Revenue Act of 1935, for example, raised marginal rates on the very highest earners to 79 percent from 63 percent, but barely raised rates at all for those below the top one-fiftieth of one percent of households. (Now that was class warfare!)
We found that an increase in marginal rates on an income group leads to a decrease in its reported taxable income relative to other groups. Indeed, because the variation is so large, the effect can be pinned down much more precisely than in most postwar studies. But the estimated impact is very small -- almost at the bottom of the postwar studies' range. One likely reason is that the tax system between the two world wars was very simple -- all the instructions and tax forms for the personal income tax fit on just six pages. As a result, there were few legal methods of shielding income.
Where does this leave us? I can't say marginal rates don't matter at all. They have some impact on reported income, and it's possible they have other effects through subtle channels not captured in the studies I've described. But the strong conclusion from available evidence is that their effects are small. This means policy makers should spend a lot less time worrying about the incentive effects of marginal rates and a lot more worrying about other tax issues.
Most obviously, the federal budget is on a collision course with reality. Reining in the long-run deficit will have to involve slowing the growth rate of spending. But unless we choose to gut Medicare and Medicaid, additional tax revenue will be needed. This essential truth is the No. 1 factor that should be driving tax policy. And anyone who tells you that the way to raise revenue is to cut marginal tax rates is arguing from ideology, not solid evidence.
Many people have proposed raising revenue by cutting back on deductions and loopholes -- so-called tax expenditures. Indeed, all else being equal, such changes are preferable to raising marginal rates. After all, higher rates do have some disincentive effects. Eliminating special tax provisions would also simplify tax preparation, and give people less incentive to try to game the system.
But if moderate increases in marginal rates wouldn't much affect behavior, a mix of rate increases and cuts in tax expenditures might be a sensible path. Some tax expenditures, like the favorable tax treatment of employer-provided health insurance, may have worrisome effects (by encouraging overly generous plans) and so should be trimmed. But others, like deductibility of charitable giving, may be worth keeping.
Finally, income inequality has surged in recent decades. Raising marginal rates on the wealthy is a straightforward, effective way to counter this trend, while helping to solve our looming deficit problem. Given the strong evidence that the incentive effects of marginal rates are small, opponents of such a move will need a new argument. Invoking the myth of terrible supply-side consequences just won't cut it.

HIGHLIGHT: A system coming apart at the seams. 

 BODY:
Reed Abelson at Economix points us to a startling study on the effects of the Great Recession on health insurance. You can see similar trends in the Census data, but for whatever reason this survey -- carried out by a highly reputable group -- is even stronger. Here's the key picture:
What this says is that the system that has provided workable insurance coverage to many (but not enough) Americans is coming apart at the seams. And this in turn means that if health reform goes down, we're going to be looking at a wave of misery spreading across the land.

HEADLINE: Romneys Make Pitch to Women Before Illinois Primary

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Ann Romney is deployed before the Illinois primary and courts women voters with an economic argument. 

 BODY:
MOLINE, Ill. - With the Republican primary race turning into a long and protracted slog for delegates that could potentially last until the convention, Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann, made an appeal on Sunday morning to a coveted group of swing voters: women.
"I love it that women are upset, too, that women are talking about the economy, I love that," Mrs. Romney said at a pancake breakfast here. "Women are talking about jobs; women are talking about deficit spending. Thank you, women."
She concluded, with a direct plea: "We need you. We all need you in November, too. We have to remember why we're upset and what we've got to do to fix things."
Mr. Romney's pitch, which also focused on the economy - the animating force of his campaign - was more subtle, as he talked about mothers hurt by the rising cost of gasoline.
"You've got moms that are driving their kids to school and practice after school and other appointments and wonder how they can afford putting gasoline in the car, at the same time putting food on the table night after night," he said. "This president doesn't understand the economy. He's an economic lightweight, and he's made decisions that have hurt the American people."
It was not the first time that Mrs. Romney had overtly reached out to women. On Super Tuesday, where the campaign leading up to those primaries had been dominated by ta discussion of contraception, Mrs. Romney used part of her speech to speak to the women she said she had been hearing from "all across this country."
"Do you know what women care about - and this is what I love - women care about jobs," she said. "Women care about the economy, they care about their children, and they care about the debt. And they're angry, they're furious about the entitlement debt that we're leaving our children."
She concluded: "So this is what we're hearing when we're out there - this is our message. It's an economic message, it's about the future for our children, and that's what I'm hearing out there."

HEADLINE: Santorum Faults G.O.P. for Favoring Urban Wealthy

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON and RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: Rick Santorum has been instigating an urban-rural rivalry to make the case that he is more conservative than Mitt Romney, but he escalated the attack to include his party's tax stance. 

 BODY:
HERRIN, Ill. - Rick Santorum has accused President Obama of waging class warfare, of dividing America, "the 99 vs. the one."
But Mr. Santorum has sought to motivate his followers by highlighting a different sort of divide, urban vs. rural, as he has campaigned around Missouri and downstate Illinois. And because the nation's small towns are suffering economically, Mr. Santorum's pitch is taking on a class note - and his own party.
"Think about it, look at the map of the United States. Blue being the Democrats, red being the Republicans - it's almost all red," Mr. Santorum on Saturday evening. "Except around the big cities. And yet when you look at the economic plan that Republicans put forward, it's all about tax breaks for higher income individuals who live in those blue areas mostly."
Mr. Santorum said his proposal of a zero percent corporate tax rate for manufacturing would bring manufacturing and processing jobs back to America's small towns. 
For its part, the Obama administration has struggled to show results for the billions of dollars it directed to small business financing and installing broadband services in rural areas, where the poverty is 16.6 percent, compared to a national average of 13.9 percent, according to the latest census.
Before highlighting the differences in beneficiaries of G.O.P. tax proposals, Mr. Santorum had been instigating the urban-rural rivalry as a way to suggest that Mr. Romney was the candidate of more liberal city dwellers, and that he was the candidate of more conservative country folk, although polls show that Mr. Romney tends to do well in suburban areas.
At a rally in Osage Beach, Mo., on Friday morning, Mr. Santorum complained about "all of the experts and pundits" who say that "we've got to elect someone who's more moderate, someone who can appeal to moderates and independents in New York City and Los Angeles....." -- to which many in the crowd of about 500 booed in sympathy -- "....on Wall Street and corporate boardrooms. That's who we have to nominate, someone who can appeal to them."
He then said there was an analysis -- he didn't say by who -- that showed that he had "won 60 percent of the counties throughout the entire course of this primary."
"And if you look at where my Republican opponent has won, it's always in and around the cities," he said, in what seemed a clear reference to Mr. Romney, though he did not name him.
"It almost looks like a Republican versus a Democrat, when you look at these states," Mr. Santorum said. "And he's winning the areas the Democrats win, and I win the areas the Republicans win."
"Does that tell you something, maybe?" he said, to applause.
"If we're going to win this election, we have to have a candidate who is going to energize our base, get them excited," he added. "Someone who is authentic. Someone who hasn't taken every side of every issue throughout their political career."

HEADLINE: U.P.S. to Buy TNT Express for $6.8 Billion

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The United Parcel Service agreed on Monday to buy TNT Express, a Dutch shipping company, for about $6.8 billion, as the company looked to expand its presence overseas. 

 BODY:
5:25 a.m. | Updated 
United Parcel Service reached an agreement on Monday to acquire TNT Express, a Dutch shipping company, for 5.2 billion euros, or $6.8 billion.
The deal, months in the making, would greatly increase the American company's market share in Europe and open inroads in China. The newly combined company would earn 36 percent of its combined revenues outside the United States, compared with 26 percent of U.P.S.'s current revenues, according to a statement from both companies.
The deal for TNT Express was sealed after U.P.S. raised its takeover bid to about 9.50 euros a share from 9 euros a share. It would be the largest acquisition in the 105-year history of U.P.S., whose biggest purchase to date was its $1.2 billion takeover of the Overnite Corporation in 2005, according to data from Capital IQ.
 U.P.S. has plenty of resources to pay for TNT Express, with almost $4.3 billion of cash and short-term investments on its books as of Dec. 31. It reported $3.8 billion in net income for 2011 on gross revenue of $53.1 billion. The company said it would pay for the transaction with $3 billion in cash reserves and through new bank loans.
"With this combination, both U.P.S. and TNT Express will significantly enhance their ability to serve our combined customers' complex global logistics needs," the U.P.S. chief executive, D. Scott Davis, said in a statement. "The additional capabilities and broadened global footprint will support the growth and globalization of our customers' businesses."
The transaction, which is supported by the boards of both companies, must still receive regulatory approval. U.P.S. said the deal would close by the end of September.
The company said it expected to achieve annual pretax cost savings of up to $725 million by the end of the fourth year after completing the deal. The company added that implementation costs related to the transaction would total $1.3 billion over four years.
The proposed deal ends months of questions about the fate of TNT Express, which was spun off from the Dutch mail carrier TNT in May. Investors in the company have grown impatient over the lagging stock performance of TNT Express, which executives say was driven by reduced demand for air shipping amid a global economic slowdown.
TNT Express reported a loss of 270 million euros for in 2011 on revenue of 7.2 billion euros.
The activist hedge fund Jana Partners began a proxy fight in December, seeking at least two seats on the company's board in an effort to spur operational improvements and to prod TNT Express into a sale. TNT rejected Jana's candidates.
U.P.S. and its principal rival, FedEx, have pursued TNT's express mail delivery business in recent years.
Talks between TNT Express and U.P.S. appeared to stall last month over price, after the European company publicly rejected the offer of 9 euros a share as too low. The companies continued negotiations, discussing matters like job reductions and possible asset divestitures aimed at winning antitrust approval.
U.P.S. and TNT Express confirmed on Friday that they remained in "constructive discussions" on a possible union. Under Dutch takeover rules, U.P.S. had four weeks after approaching TNT to clarify its intentions for the company. Both sides have also had to contend with concerns from unions representing TNT Express workers about forced job cuts tied to any deal.
Shares in TNT Express leaped after the company acknowledged its talks with U.P.S., and have risen more than 50 percent since Feb. 17. They closed on Friday at 9.35 euros.
The proposed takeover would be one of the largest deals announced in what so far has been a tepid year for merger activity. Despite the presence of numerous factors for a healthy pace of deal-making, including ample cash on corporate balance sheets and a willingness of banks and bond investors to finance deals, merger volumes remain depressed.
About $385.8 billion worth of deals have been announced this year, a 39 percent drop from the period a year earlier, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
Yet bankers and lawyers say they expect merger activity to rise this year as corporate management teams and boards regain the confidence needed to pursue growth through takeovers.
Morgan Stanley, UBS, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer advised U.P.S., while Goldman Sachs, Lazard and the law firm Allen & Overy advised TNT Express and its supervisory board.

HEADLINE: At Home, Asking How 'Our Bobby' Became War Crime Suspect

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO; Reporting was contributed by William Yardley and Serge F. Kovaleski from Tacoma, Wash.; Michael Cooper and Theo Emery from Norwood, Ohio; Isolde Raftery from Seattle; Lizette Alvarez from Miami; Eric Schmitt from Washington; and Jennifer Preston from New York. Jack Begg and Toby Lyles contributed research.

 BODY:
He was not the star, just a well-regarded young man who seemed to try to do the right thing. That was Robert Bales, ''our Bobby,'' friends said. He was a busy, popular kid, but he made time for the autistic man down the block. Other neighborhood boys admired him. As a high school linebacker, he was good enough to be captain, but also gracious enough to help a more talented player take over his starting position. It was good for the team, he said.
That solid-guy reputation followed him into the Army infantry. He joined at the relatively seasoned age of 27, just a few weeks after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and became respected for his maturity and calm, including in battle. ''He was a damn good leader and a damn good soldier,'' said Zachary Parsons, who served with Staff Sergeant Bales in Iraq in 2007.
So when many of his old neighbors from Norwood, Ohio, and former battalion mates from Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State heard the news that Sergeant Bales had been accused of coldbloodedly shooting to death 16 Afghan civilians on March 11, nine of them children, they were not simply shocked. They grieved. 
Michelle Caddell, 48, who knew Sergeant Bales when he was growing up, watched a video clip of the news over and over and over again, mesmerized by disbelief. ''I wanted to see, maybe, a different face,'' she said, fighting back tears. ''Because that's not our Bobby. Something horrible, horrible had to happen to him.''
Friends, relatives and his lawyer say they have an idea of what that horrible thing was: war.
Three deployments in Iraq, where he saw heavy fighting, and a fourth in Afghanistan, where he went reluctantly, left him struggling financially, in danger of losing his home.
And there were more direct impacts. During his deployments, Sergeant Bales, 38, lost part of a foot and injured his head, saw fellow soldiers badly wounded, picked up the bodies of dead Iraqis, was treated for mild traumatic brain injury and possibly developed post-traumatic stress disorder, his lawyer and military officials said.
But there are also glimpses of a darkness in his personal life. Sergeant Bales's past includes an arrest on a misdemeanor charge of assault on a woman, which was dropped after he completed anger-management counseling; an accident in which he overturned his car, something he attributed to falling asleep at the wheel; and an accumulation of rejections and disappointments.
A year ago, according to a blog written by his wife, he was denied a promotion to sergeant first class, a rank that would have brought not just added responsibility and respect but also money at a time when his finances seemed stretched.
Neighbors remember him, in between earlier deployments, as a gung-ho solider, eager to get back to the fight. But that seemed to have changed. He trained to become a recruiter, a job that would have allowed him to skip Afghanistan, but the Army kept him in the infantry. And though he felt that his injuries were significant enough to keep him out of combat, his lawyer said, Army doctors said he was fit to deploy. Weeks later, he arrived in one of the roughest precincts of Afghanistan.
A long legal process -- starting with the formal filing of charges in the coming weeks and ending, most likely, in a court-martial -- will sort out whether Sergeant Bales was guilty of atrocities and may shed light on which, if any, of these factors played a role.
From dozens of interviews with lawyers, friends and military officials, competing legal narratives are already starting to emerge.
A military official, speaking anonymously, has said Sergeant Bales had marital problems, felt stressed by the Afghanistan deployment and snapped after drinking alcohol before the shootings.
Sergeant Bales's lawyers contend that he had a solid marriage and no drinking problems. If he cracked, they said, it was because he probably had P.T.S.D. that the Army failed to diagnose, had been dispatched to a war he did not want to fight and had seen a friend gravely wounded just before the killings.
Dr. Stephen Xenakis, a psychiatrist and retired brigadier general who was an adviser to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that after a decade of combat, where hundreds of thousands of troops have sustained traumatic brain injury and P.T.S.D., those syndromes by themselves seem inadequate to explain how a seemingly normal and widely admired sergeant might have single-handedly committed one of the worst war crimes of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.
With his multiple deployments and wounds, Dr. Xenakis said, Sergeant Bales seems emblematic of bigger problems: an overstretched military battered by 11 years of combat; failures by the military to properly identify and treat its weary, suffering troops; and the thin line dividing ''normal'' behavior in war from what later is deemed ''snapping.''
''This is equivalent to what My Lai did to reveal all the problems with the conduct of the Vietnam War,'' Dr. Xenakis said. ''The Army will want to say that soldiers who commit crimes are rogues, that they are individual, isolated cases. But they are not.''
Inspirational Teenager
Sergeant Bales grew up in Norwood, a modest suburb of Cincinnati, the youngest of five boys who lived in a two-story brick home still known as ''the Bales house,'' though no Baleses live in it anymore. The family was that well known, and that well liked.
''They're down-home country,'' Ms. Caddell said.
Mr. Bales was a gregarious, chatty, engaged teenager who played football and threw himself into an array of clubs and activities, including theater. In his yearbook, he signed the football team photo with a nickname, ''Doom,'' and is listed on the ''senior superlatives'' page as one of the best dancers in his class.
''He's one of those kids you remember,'' said David C. Griffel, the principal of Norwood High School when Mr. Bales attended. ''A real extrovert.''
Mr. Bales was a leader on the football team, a feisty middle linebacker who was not big but strong, able to bench press 300 pounds. But in his junior year, a freshman star named Marc Edwards arrived, and the coach wanted the newcomer to be the starting middle linebacker. There might have been an unpleasant rivalry, but instead Mr. Bales shared tips on the position.
''He got the idea in that situation that Marc was going to be better for the team,'' said Aaron M. Smith, the author of a book about Mr. Edwards.
Mr. Edwards was surprised by Mr. Bales's generosity. ''He credited Bob Bales with teaching him what leadership meant, and how to handle a situation that doesn't favor you,'' Mr. Smith said.
Mr. Edwards went on to be named Ohio's ''Mr. Football'' for 1992 and to play for Notre Dame, the San Francisco 49ers, the Cleveland Browns, the New England Patriots, the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Chicago Bears.
Mr. Bales was enrolled in the College of Mount St. Joseph in 1991 and 1992. He attended Ohio State University from 1993 until 1996, declaring an economics major, according to Jim Lynch, a university spokesman. It is not clear why he left, Mr. Lynch said.
Details about Mr. Bales's life during the next several years are sketchy. Friends and his lawyer said he had worked in financial services in Columbus, Ohio, then started an investment business with his brother Mark. No sign remains of their Spartina Investments at the modest office building where they leased space in Doral, Fla., a few blocks west of Miami International Airport and south of the Doral Golf Resort and Spa.
By November 2001, he had joined the Army.
''It wasn't really anger when he joined,'' said Michael Blevins, 35, a childhood friend. ''It was -- they had hurt something,'' he added, referring to the Sept. 11 terrorists.
Ms. Caddell said that she had worried about his decision, but that he had assured her, ''Nothing's going to happen to me.'' The decision made sense to Ms. Caddell's son Mark, who had idolized Mr. Bales since he was a toddler.
He has to join, Ms. Caddell recalled her son saying. ''He takes care of everybody.''
Introduction to Warfare
After basic training, Sergeant Bales was assigned to what was then known as Fort Lewis, near Tacoma, which would become the Army's Western deployment hub for the wars. For the next 11 years, he would spend his career with the Second Battalion, Third Infantry Regiment in a Stryker brigade.
In 2002, the criminal assault occurred in a Tacoma-area hotel room, but he paid his fine and completed court-mandated anger-management counseling, court records show.
Not long after, he married Karilyn Primeau, a woman he had met online, his lawyer said, and they went on to have two children, a daughter named Quincy and a son named Bobby.
The Third Brigade deployed to northern Iraq from November 2003 to November 2004, a time when the country was quickly devolving into looting, insurgency and chaos. But it was Sergeant Bales's second tour, from June 2006 into September 2007, that was particularly eventful.
By then, Iraq was in the throes of sectarian civil war, and American troops were dying at a rate of about 80 a month. David Hardt, a Third Brigade soldier who wrote a blog about the deployment, said that the enemy had almost always been invisible and that soldiers had grown bitterly frustrated at their inability to fight back.
''You sort of got used to seeing dead bodies, seeing things blow up in front of you,'' said Mr. Hardt, who did not know Sergeant Bales but was in Iraq at the same time. ''We wanted to get insurgents, but it's so rare that we succeeded.''
In one extraordinary battle in January 2007, however, Sergeant Bales's battalion encountered as many as 600 Shiite militia fighters while trying to recover a downed Apache helicopter in Najaf. In a pitched two-day battle that included airstrikes and mortar exchanges, the American forces claimed to have killed 250 enemy fighters while losing none of their own.
''The cool part about this was, World War II-style, you dug in,'' Sergeant Bales, then a team leader, was quoted as saying in a recounting of the battle by the Fort Lewis newspaper. ''You're taking a shovel and digging as fast as you can.''
''I've never been more proud to be a part of this unit than that day,'' he added.
Somewhere during that deployment, Sergeant Bales injured his foot, though his lawyer said he did not know how. The Army has declined to provide details about the sergeant's record.
But the injury did not seem significant enough to remove him from Iraq, and he seems to have finished the tour, which was extended to 15 months from 12 in what became known as the surge.
Mr. Hardt said most soldiers he knew were angry about the extension because they were exhausted by the continuous fighting and the threats of roadside bombs. But if Sergeant Bales was upset, he did not seem to complain. When he returned to the Tacoma area, he was limping, neighbors said, but also working hard to rehabilitate his foot because he wanted to return to full duty.
''He was a gung-ho Army guy,'' said Tim Burgess, 59, a retired trucker and warehouse worker who lived next door to Sergeant Bales at the time. ''He still wanted to see action even though he had been wounded.''
Neighbors remembered his wife as an avid bicyclist but not particularly sociable. Records show that she worked as a project manager at now-defunct Washington Mutual, then became an associate technical project manager at Amaxra, a business communications company in Redmond.
Sergeant Bales was home for nearly two years after his second deployment. Mrs. Bales, also an avid blogger, cheerfully recounted baking cookies, reading books and visiting her parents in Bellingham with their daughter.
By August 2009, he was gone again. It was a quieter tour, with more nation building than combat. In a Facebook exchange with a childhood friend, Steven Berling, Sergeant Bales called the deployment ''boring'' and ''pretty dumb,'' then lamented the lack of fighting.
''Giving money to Hagji instead of bullets just don't seem right,'' he wrote, apparently misspelling Hajji, a term used by soldiers, often pejoratively, in referring to Arab people.
Financial and Career Setbacks
About the time Sergeant Bales was preparing to deploy in 2009, the Baleses were having financial problems, records show.
Early in their relationship, they had lived in a house in Auburn, between Seattle and Tacoma, that Mrs. Bales had owned before they were together. According to records, they received a notice of a trustee sale in mid-2009. The couple, who had moved out by then, had missed $17,000 in payments and owed a total of $195,000 to the bank.
A trustee auction was scheduled for October 2009, while Sergeant Bales was in Iraq, but the auction was postponed three times and then called off in early 2010 for reasons that are unclear.
Robert Baggett, president of the neighborhood's Riverpark Estates Homeowners Association, said the Baleses had stopped paying their annual association dues of about $120 at least two years ago. The house, which for a while was occupied by renters whose noise drew complaints from neighbors, has been vacant for about 18 months and is now filthy and in disrepair. ''We are parking cars there to keep it looking like it is occupied so no homeless move in,'' Mr. Baggett said.
The Baleses bought their two-story house in Lake Tapps, east of Tacoma, in 2005, records show. But just three days before the shootings in Afghanistan, Mrs. Bales told a real estate agent, Phillip Rodocker, that she wanted to sell the house because they were financially stretched. The house is listed for sale at $229,000, about $50,000 less than what the family paid for it.
Asked about the mortgage problems, Sergeant Bales's lawyer, John Henry Browne, said, ''There are no financial pressures on the family right now other than the normal ones that are experienced by the 99 percenters.''
Last March, Mrs. Bales wrote on her blog that her husband had not gotten the hoped-for promotion to sergeant first class, which would have raised his pay by about $370 a month and made him eligible to be the senior noncommissioned officer for a platoon. (He was also paid an extra $400 a month during his deployments.) The promotion probably would have also given him some peace of mind about his Army career, which was nearly halfway to the 20 years needed for retirement with pay.
Though ''sad and disappointed'' by the news, Mrs. Bales said she was also relieved. ''We can finally move on to the next phase of our lives,'' she wrote.
The Final Deployment
That next phase, the Baleses hoped, would take them to Germany, Italy or Hawaii. But the Army did not move Sergeant Bales from Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Nor did it allow him to become a recruiter, though he was in training for the job. Instead, he was told he would go with the Third Brigade to Afghanistan in December.
''He was not happy about it,'' Mr. Browne said, but took his orders like a professional soldier.
Before deploying, Sergeant Bales would have undergone physical exams, including on his foot, and a computer-based survey for traumatic brain injury intended to measure attention, memory and thinking ability. The survey is not well regarded among many specialists, but it remains the Army's chief screening tool for traumatic brain injury. Sergeant Bales was declared fit to deploy.
Little is known about his time in Afghanistan, other than that he and others in his battalion were assigned to work alongside Army Special Forces soldiers in the Panjwai district of Kandahar Province, a longtime hotbed of Taliban activity that has grown more secure in recent years. Sergeant Bales would probably have provided security for the Green Berets while they carried out night raids, built relations with village leaders and organized local militias.
A Green Beret who has spent time in Panjwai in the past year said the combat outpost would have been relatively small, protected by dirt-filled containers known as Hesco barriers, with guard towers and perhaps a blimp with a high-powered camera capable of capturing images more than a mile away. It would have been difficult, but not impossible, for Sergeant Bales to slip away at night unnoticed, as the Army says he did.
Supervision in the outpost might also have been more lax than at larger bases, which could explain the presence of alcohol. Sergeant Bales might have even been among the more senior noncommissioned officers on his team. Special Forces teams typically have 12 members, sometimes fewer, and Sergeant Bales's unit might have been as small as a platoon of two dozen soldiers.
Many younger soldiers consider such assignments exciting and more fulfilling, though they are also potentially more dangerous. But Mr. Browne said Sergeant Bales had considered the posting ''grueling,'' noting that the soldiers lived in metal cargo containers.
''It was very tough and rustic,'' the lawyer said.
About a week ago, Mr. Browne said, Sergeant Bales saw a friend lose a leg to a buried mine. Soon after, according to Mr. Browne, he sent his wife a short message: ''Hard day for the good guys.''
About a day later, Army officials said, Sergeant Bales walked out of the outpost and headed toward the nearby village.

HEADLINE: A Vision of Reviving Tribal Ways In a Remote Corner of California

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

 BODY:
KLAMATH, Calif. -- From a forested bluff, Willard Carlson Jr. stands watch over Blue Creek where its indigo eddies meet the gray-green riffles of the Klamath River. The creek is sacred to Yurok Indians like himself: it flows into high country, a pilgrimage point and a source of curative power for tribal healers. The Yurok consider it their ''golden stairway'' and weave its stepped pattern into their basketry.
This is a California few outsiders know, where remote villages still await electricity, and the river is a liquid neighborhood. For the state's largest tribe, with about 5,000 members, well-publicized battles over fishing rights and hydroelectric dams are perhaps less pressing day to day than the question ''What part of the river are you from?''
Five years ago, Mr. Carlson was rebounding from alcohol and drug abuse when he felt the need to return here, to his family's ancestral ground. One night, cooking salmon and eel over an alder fire, he vowed to do something that had not been tried here for at least 150 years: to build a traditional Yurok village from scratch, a ceremonial place that will ''bring people home to reconnect with the old ways,'' he said. 
Mr. Carlson, now 59, his salt-and-pepper hair heavy on the salt, named the village now rising in a clearing Ah Pah, or ''the beginning of the stairway.'' He views it as a place of healing for ''the many people who have lost their way.''
Aided by foundation grants, the project is part of a broad resurgence in traditional tribal culture that began in tandem with the American Indian civil rights movement and aims to foster community resilience and identity. The Yurok villages that once existed by the hundreds on the banks of the Klamath, now reservation land, were homesteads for extended families. Ah Pah will be a ceremonial rather than a residential gathering place -- ''a college of knowledge,'' Mr. Carlson said on a foggy, chilly morning, sipping tea made from wild coastal vines.
Mr. Carlson has already built a dance pit and plans to build a sweat lodge for prayers and a plank house where basket weavers and other artisans can demonstrate their work.
In Yurok country, close to the Oregon border, rituals like the brush dance -- a three-day ceremony to heal a sick child or pray for a long, healthy life -- are flourishing, especially during the summer dance season, when they attract hundreds every weekend. Yurok language classes are now an elective at four local high schools, including the Klamath River Early College of the Redwoods, a charter school that incorporates fishing and other cultural knowledge into the curriculum. There is also a newfound expertise among the young in basketry and a growing interest in native foods, exemplified by a sign in the lobby of a multitribal health clinic in Arcata, about an hour's drive south of Klamath, that says ''Got Acorns?''
To build his traditional village, Mr. Carlson and young student volunteers -- all male, as is the custom -- have cleared hundreds of stumps, hauled redwood logs from afar down muddy roads and split them into planks the old-fashioned way, using a hammer and an iron wedge.
In a sense, Ah Pah is also Mr. Carlson's own ''golden stairway''-- a path to personal and cultural renewal. His struggles with alcohol and methamphetamine, which he openly acknowledges, are endemic to generations of Yurok, who live with poverty and unemployment rates that range from 30 percent in coastal towns to 80 percent on the upper reservation. Some, like Mr. Carlson's 76-year-old mother, Marguerite, live in houses accessible only by boat.
Mr. Carlson's son Per-gish, whose name means ''gray eagle,'' recalled the landmarks of his own childhood: ''Three bars -- that's it.''
Per-gish is now a professional fishing guide, with an eaglelike knowledge of the river and the seasonal arrivals of steelhead, eel and salmon. ''Everything that happens everywhere else happens here,'' he observed of the social ills that continue to reverberate. ''There is an imbalance between bounty and want.''
The Yurok have endured massacres during the Gold Rush in the mid-19th century, the subsequent forced removal of Indian children to boarding schools and a violent dispute in 1978 over a moratorium on salmon fishing that pitted Indians against federal agents. The fight politicized many Yurok. Mr. Carlson was arrested numerous times, once for ''letting an agent have it,'' he said, before diving off his boat and ''side-stroking away like an eel in a Pendleton shirt,'' he recalled.
Years later, in his 40s with four children, his life hit bottom after four back-to-back D.W.I. convictions landed him in jail. ''I wasn't even visiting my children,'' said Mr. Carlson, who was by then separated from his partner. ''I knew it had to end.''
His rehabilitation finally took hold eight years ago when he boarded a bus to San Francisco with $42 in savings and enrolled at Friendship House, a nonprofit residential substance abuse center for American Indians. Toward the end of the program, ''praying for guidance,'' Mr. Carlson noticed a street sign near Golden Gate Park that said ''Willard North.'' He took it as a signal that he was meant to go home.
''Willard led his own rehabilitation,'' said David Tripp, an associate professor at Redwood Community College who runs the tribe's vocational rehabilitation program. ''It was healing for him to go back to his points of origin.''
Mr. Carlson needs more old-growth redwood to finish the village, he said, but the rectangular brush dance pit, composed of chiseled redwood planks, is now complete, as is the ''dress house'' for treasured dance regalia made from feathers, abalone and shells.
The prospect of a first brush dance at Ah Pah, which is planned for July, is a much-anticipated event, said Christopher Peters, president and chief executive of the Seventh Generation Fund for Indian Development, a nonprofit foundation that regards the village project as a reaffirmation of spiritual practices. ''Ah Pah is a pathway to sacred places,'' he said. Because of its remote location near Blue Creek, he added, only ''those most interested in revitalized traditional ceremonies are apt to be there.''
The dances nearly disappeared early in the 20th century along with other rituals, said Geneva Wiki, founder of the charter school in Klamath and the executive director of the Wild Rivers Community Foundation. ''There was a fair amount of hopelessness and depression,'' she said. ''It wasn't O.K. to be an Indian.''
Now, young people use Facebook to notify one another when the eels are running, or when there is good acorning in the hills.
Among Mr. Carlson's proteges is 18-year-old Sammy Genshaw III, who honed his building skills at Ah Pah. ''The wood has a spirit, which will now live indefinitely in the village,'' said Mr. Genshaw, whose goal is to be the first American Indian governor of California. ''Those planks are going to see my kids.''

HEADLINE: New Challenges Facing the Constitution

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Cry, the Beloved Constitution,'' by J. Harvie Wilkinson III (Op-Ed, March 12), about assaults on the Constitution from liberals and conservatives:
Issues at the intersection of law and culture pose the greatest challenge to our Constitution. Today's views of segregation, reproductive rights and same-sex marriage would have been unthinkable to the founders, and their views would be unworkable for us today. Judges have the hard job of determining when the culture has changed enough that the law must change.
The best assurance of constitutional health is the consistent application of the law and all its judicial precedents. The adjudication of same-sex marriage in California has been a model of such judicial rigor, addressing the activist politics on both sides within a consistent legal framework. Other courts may apply equal rigor and reach a different result. These are the growing pains of a rapidly changing culture. 
These are also the difficulties of working with a very old founding document. Only by respecting its evolution through generations of careful interpretation can we hope to maintain our Constitution in its third century.
RON L. MEYERS New York, March 12, 2012
The writer is a lawyer.
To the Editor:
One comes away from J. Harvie Wilkinson III's paean to judicial restraint wondering what purpose he thinks the Constitution serves and whether it should play any meaningful role in limiting the size, scope or intrusiveness of government.
Some of the Supreme Court's most appalling moments have been when it deferred to the base impulses of political majorities and upheld policies like racial segregation, internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, eugenic sterilization and the abuse of eminent domain for ill-conceived ''economic development'' projects.
It is difficult to tell which, if any, of those decisions Judge Wilkinson's highly deferential theory of judicial review would reject. The Constitution is not a majoritarian document, and there is no ''inalienable'' right to arbitrarily impose our will on other people, whether through naked coercion or politics masquerading as law.
CLARK NEILY Senior Attorney, Institute for Justice Arlington, Va., March 13, 2012
To the Editor:
J. Harvie Wilkinson III chides liberals for creating ''rights from whole cloth,'' rather than adhering to the rights clearly stated in the Constitution. When 18th-century men wrote and debated the Bill of Rights, a primary concern was that the process of enumeration would limit the rights of future generations to only those enumerated.
Thus, the Ninth Amendment was added: ''The enumeration in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.''
It is entirely appropriate and constitutional for us to continue to identify those rights, even personal rights, that we the people believe are worth protecting.
JANET ELLINGSON Salt Lake City, March 12, 2012
To the Editor:
While I'm sensitive to the risks that J. Harvie Wilkinson III sets forth, I don't believe that the Constitution is equally in danger from the left and the right.
For one thing, the rights that liberals have affirmed in recent decades have not been created from ''whole cloth'' but have evolved out of a long tradition of constitutional thought.
On the other hand, conservatives haven't hesitated to overturn generations of constitutional jurisprudence to identify new ''rights'' on behalf of interests and causes they favor, like corporate personhood.
As for the political aspect of this issue, liberals have sought, in general, to evoke rights that empower the vulnerable and the oppressed. Conservatives have sought, by and large, to empower the already powerful -- exactly what the Bill of Rights was drafted to curtail.
Conservatives seem more interested in imposed values -- theirs, of course -- than in the ''shared'' ones invoked by Mr. Wilkinson. Where's that in the Constitution?

HEADLINE: Traffic-Free Plaza Roils Little India in Queens

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

 BODY:
The new pedestrian plaza on 37th Road in Jackson Heights, in the heart of Little India, is an oasis of calm, a much-needed stretch of open space in a traffic-glutted area of Queens. Or, it is a glaring example of disastrous city planning, a blighted, unlovely esplanade that has all but decimated commerce in the neighborhood.
It depends on whom you ask. 
Last September, in efforts to create more open space and decongest nearby Roosevelt Avenue, the city repurposed one block of the road -- much as the Bloomberg administration has reinvented chunks of Times Square -- to be a haven for pedestrians.
But the plaza bears little resemblance to Times Square, just six miles away. A half-dozen traffic-blocking boulders and rickety picnic tables seem to be the sum total of the alterations to the streetscape to date, but business owners say it has been enough to turn a once-bustling block into a barren one.
In the coming days, the plaza will be tweaked: parking spots will be added and a tributary road rerouted, among other things. But still the community remains divided between merchants and residents, who see the plaza, between 73rd and 74th Streets, as a boon for a park-starved populace.
''This is a business place, this is not Times Square where people come from all of the world and sit there,'' said Javed Chaudhry, who sells phone cards and accessories at GRB Distributors. He recalled feeling a mounting dread as the boulders rolled in. ''I knew I was going to lose my bread and butter,'' he said.
Without car traffic or the Q47 and Q49 buses that used to stop on the block, many merchants claim business has fallen by at least half. Park advocates say the recession is more to blame. But even during the economy's darkest days, says Raj Bhalla, who sells cellphones, Jackson Heights was largely spared, because of the bustling business of East Asian people drawn here for products from their homelands.
Councilman Daniel Dromm, a Democrat who had pushed for the plaza, said he believed the business owners were overstating the impact, and he challenged the merchants to turn over their books and prove their losses. No one has done so.
Even if the business community were to prove its claim, Mr. Dromm said, the plaza would most likely stay.
The plaza was created after an 18-month study of safety and congestion in Jackson Heights by the city's Transportation Department, said Seth Solomonow, a department spokesman. No cost estimate is available, he said: the boulders, tables and paint were already on hand. It broke ground after unanimous resolutions by Community Boards 3 and 4.
''They didn't ask me anything; nobody knew,'' said Abdul Karim, who manages the Jackson Heights Music Center on 37th Road. ''They just came. They closed the street.''
Mr. Dromm said that he tried to reach out to business owners but that he was dismissed.
Nooruddin Dashti owns two jewelry shops on the road. Since the closing in September, he says, he was forced to reduce hours at his newest shop after firing all but one of his employees because he could no longer pay them.
Little India's customer base, the merchants argue, is not foot traffic. Destination shoppers come here for Nepalese, Indian and Bangladeshi goods. The closing ate up parking spots, merchants say, and made streets unnavigable.
Some passers-by, however, enjoy it. ''We like it, it's nice, it's kind of less crowded, otherwise you'd see a lot of vehicles coming from here, there, you never know,'' said Karsang Dawa, who lives nearby in Woodside. ''But it's very dirty, that's a problem.''
Mr. Dashti says he has been fined by the Sanitation Department for picnickers' litter. On a recent Thursday, piles of garbage spilled from trash bags on the tables and lumped in the street, next to boxes and a broken television. Cigarette butts eddied in the gutters. Workers from the Doe Fund now clean multiple times a day, says Mr. Dromm, who spent $42,500 from his discretionary fund on sanitation there.
On a sunny morning in early March, the street was nearly empty. A few men slept at the blue picnic tables, more than one emitting a scent that made sharing a table impossible. The lounging men have become a fixture since the street closed, people who live nearby said.
One man, who gave his name only as Derek, said he began hanging out on the block as soon as the street was closed. ''Rather than be on an avenue that is all active and engines flowing here and going there,'' said Derek, as he paced back and forth unsteadily, ''it's calm and tranquil.''

HEADLINE: Prospect of Jury Trial in Mets' Madoff Case May Push Sides Toward Settlement

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR and KEN BELSON; Peter Lattman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As in any civil case, there has always been a chance that the owners of the Mets and the trustee for the victims of Bernard L. Madoff's Ponzi scheme could settle before trial. But across the past year of acrimony, that prospect has often seemed remote.
The owners, outraged at the accusations of the trustee, said they were determined to restore their reputations, and a jury verdict in their favor could do that. 
The trustee, Irving H. Picard, under pressure to recoup as much money as possible for the hundreds of victims he represents, and smarting from the angry charges of misconduct hurled at him by the Mets' owners, Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, seems dug in.
Picard has accused Wilpon and Katz of ignoring warnings that Madoff was running a fraud during their many years of investing with him. They have said they were unaware of any ''red flags'' and have charged that Picard fabricated and distorted evidence against them.
But with the jury trial set to start Monday in Manhattan federal court after more than a year of back and forth, it is possible that the sides have suffered enough defeat not to want to risk a big loss at trial.
The Mets' owners are already on the hook to pay the trustee up to $83 million. Rolling the dice that they could lose another $303 million at trial could be risky.
Moreover, last week's ruling by Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the United States District Court -- that the burden of proof was on the Mets' owners at trial to show they had acted in good faith and had no reason to suspect Madoff was a fraud -- might have altered the case.
''The burden of proof shifted the pendulum,'' said Michael Kline, a partner at Fox Rothschild LLP in Princeton, N.J. He added, ''It's sort of challenging for the Mets.''
The jurors must decide the case by a preponderance of proof -- that the evidence is at least 51 percent in favor of one side or the other -- not by a reasonable doubt, which is a much higher standard.
Kline added that Wilpon and Katz face having to testify, being cross-examined and hearing testimony of others called by the trustee, before they put on their case.
''The Wilpons are going to have their personal, family and economic lives brought out into the open beyond anything they can think of and any owner has endured,'' Kline said. ''If they go through this whole trial, they're certainly going to have a lot of things that people are going to think are unseemly.''
Wilpon and Katz may also be thinking of the impact the trial could have on the Mets, who have seen attendance slide and fan dissatisfaction grow.
''Opening day is April 5, and the Wilpons want to be on the back page talking about the Mets on the field, not in the courtroom,'' said Anthony Sabino, a trial lawyer who teaches at St. John's.
For Picard, a settlement would limit his ability to get the maximum financial recovery at trial while avoiding further negative rulings by Rakoff, who has not been a fan of Picard's position. If some of Rakoff's adverse rulings were enshrined as law by an appellate court panel, it could have a much broader impact on the trustee's litigation campaign than a trial court ruling would. Picard originally sought to recover $1 billion in fictitious profits and principal invested by Wilpon, Katz, their relatives and associates at their holding company, over a six-year period. Rakoff slashed the period to two years, reducing the maximum recovery to $386 million.
Picard has already said he will appeal the two-year decision, with its possible effects in the billion of dollars in hundreds of other cases. The trustee may also have doubts about how much money Wilpon and Katz have and how quickly they could produce $386 million if found guilty.
Mark Conrad, who teaches sports law at Fordham University said: ''For Picard, there have been some accusations that he's been overreaching. His duty is to get as much money as he can, but there would be an appeal and it would drag on even longer.''
Mario M. Cuomo, a former New York governor who is the mediator in the case, has attended hearings but there has been no palpable optimism about a deal. Asked Sunday if a settlement could come as early as Monday, he said by telephone, ''You'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out.'' He said that his goal in meeting with both sides has been to reach a settlement which could theoretically come at any point during the trial.
Any settlement would logically be between $83 million and $386 million. The Mets might think that they could afford to pay a potential settlement in the neighborhood of $165 million. Still, producing a lot of cash quickly might be difficult.
The team is strapped with debt that would make it unlikely that banks would lend them even more money. Selling a substantial chunk of their estimated 70 percent stake in the SNY cable network must be approved by their partners. And their ability to quickly sell any of their commercial real estate holdings would appear to be limited by having to unravel some of their many partnerships in the still-uncertain property market.
The trial is set to begin with the selection of nine jurors who will be questioned by Rakoff. If the process goes quickly, opening statements could be delivered and some testimony could be heard by day's end.
Rakoff is also scheduled to rule on motions to limit some testimony and disallow certain witnesses, including Sandy Koufax, the Hall of Fame pitcher who is a childhood friend of Wilpon's and who invested with Madoff at Wilpon's suggestion.

HEADLINE: 'Garage Universities' Are Bracing for School Reform

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; Maggy Ayala contributed reporting.

 BODY:
QUITO, Ecuador -- There are no ivy-covered walls at Alfredo Perez Guerrero University. No quad. No soccer fields. The entire campus fits in four small, rented buildings on the fringes of a modest residential neighborhood. Its main entrance is on a busy street, between a furniture shop and a store that sells remote-controlled toy cars and airplanes.
But on a recent evening, students lounged out front and debated the question that thousands of their peers are asking about what President Rafael Correa has called Ecuador's ''garage universities'': what do we do if the government shuts our school down?
''There is a lot of anxiety, a lot of uncertainty,'' said Carlos Ortega, 27, who is in his fourth year of a five-year law degree course at Alfredo Perez. The school is one of 24 privately owned universities that have received a failing grade from the Ecuadorean government, meaning that if they do not make major improvements they will be closed. Two government-run schools also received failing grades and may be shut down. 
For Mr. Correa, a former university economics professor, the changes cannot come soon enough. ''Ecuador probably has the worst universities'' in South America, he said in an interview at the presidential palace this month. Many of the failing universities, which serve 69,500, ''are cheating their students because they don't have the minimum elements to guarantee academic excellence,'' he said.
Mr. Correa's leftist government is undertaking a major reset of the system, which includes 71 universities and 621,000 students. That effort began in earnest in late 2009 when the government conducted an evaluation of the country's universities, grading them from A to E.
This year, for the first time, admission to the country's 29 public universities, which have about 70 percent of all students, will be based on an aptitude test. That is meant to replace a chaotic and often unfair system in which many students got into schools because they knew people who could pull strings. Others stood in line for hours to get open slots.
Unlike the SAT in the United States, the test measures basic learning skills, rather than knowledge, and the government hopes it will help increase university access among poorer students, including indigenous groups. A new Constitution passed in 2008 eliminated tuition to the public universities, in another step to make education more accessible to the poor.
The government is also seeking to improve the quality of teaching. By 2017, all professors must have at least a master's degree, and many will be required to have a doctoral degree.
That will not be easy. Some educators say the goals are too ambitious. Only three universities in Ecuador give Ph.D.'s and they grant a total of about 20 a year, according to Rene Ramirez, the government secretary of higher education, science, technology and innovation.
''In a short time we're trying to make a radical change,'' Mr. Ramirez said.
In part to increase the pool of qualified professors, the government has embarked on an ambitious scholarship program. A few years ago, the country gave scholarships for postgraduate study abroad to about 20 students a year. Last year, 1,070 students got the scholarships. This year, Mr. Ramirez expects that number to exceed 3,000.
Students who get the scholarships agree to return to Ecuador when their studies are finished and remain here for at least twice the time the government paid for them to be abroad. The government hopes they will become university professors or work in the private sector.
To get this far, Mr. Correa has had to take on some sacred cows of the left. The government's evaluation process punched a hole in the traditional autonomy of universities. Though the emergence of so-called garage universities illustrates the demand for higher education, Mr. Correa also says that not all students will be able to go to college. He favors a system based on merit.
The strategy, he said, was to ''make universities more selective, because at least in the short term the country doesn't have the resources to greatly enlarge its capacity in terms of the number of universities.''
Until recently, the opposite was occurring. In the last 20 years, a cottage industry was born around the creation of small, privately operated universities. With virtually no regulation, the quality of these schools was often very low -- although the profits could be quite high.
They earned the name ''garage universities'' because the worst ones were a long way from having the facilities and academic resources of more established schools. Some specialized in giving courses online. Most used part-time professors, which Mr. Ramirez said meant lower teaching quality. About half the students received degrees in business administration. Cosmetology was another popular degree.
After they were graded in late 2009, the failing schools were given time to make improvements before undergoing a new round of evaluations, which is wrapping up now. The results will be announced next month.
Still, there is wide expectation that at least some schools will be closed. The government has pledged that most of the students at those schools will be transferred to other universities.
But that could be thousands of students in a system that is already overloaded, and many students worry that there will not be enough room for them. Or they fear that because their previous school was considered inferior they will have to drop back a year, meaning it will take longer to graduate and bring more costs.
''I don't think they are going to be able to find room for all the students,'' said Pamela Medina, a second-year medical student at the Latin American Christian University in the capital, Quito, the only one of the failing schools that offers a medical degree.
All of the failing schools were created since the mid-1990s; their administrators said that put them at a disadvantage.
''It was radically unfair to judge a young university against much older universities using the same parameters and requirements,'' said Susan Cordero, the rector of the University of Otavalo, a failing school that was created eight years ago.
It is in Imbabura Province, a heavily indigenous area north of Quito. Forty percent of its 280 students belong to indigenous groups, which Ms. Cordero said made the school unique.
At Alfredo Perez Guerrero University in Quito, students said the school's tuition of about $1,100 a semester was less expensive than in many other schools. They also praised the small class sizes, with often as few as 10 or fewer students in a class.
Jorge Enriquez Paez, the school's rector, said he made changes to meet government standards, including buying more computers. But he said that only a fifth of the professors were full-time, well below the government's goal of 60 percent.
Mr. Enriquez said that he created the school using his own savings because he believes in his country's young people. ''This is a life's work, not a business,'' he said. ''I am a dreamer.''

HEADLINE: The Downside of a Balmy Winter? Long Walks With the Dog Aren't Carefree

BYLINE: By KAREN ANN CULLOTTA

 BODY:
Annette Kowalczyk, a retiree, and her trusty dog, Beau, were extraordinarily active last month, relishing long walks through her suburban Chicago neighborhood -- a pleasant change from last winter, when icy sidewalks and bitter cold made their favorite pastime downright treacherous.
Alas, for poor Beau, a bichon frise who suffered a nasty tick bite in February, the balmy winter weather also appears to have encouraged legions of ticks to abandon their typically sedentary winter habit of lounging docilely under snow drifts, in favor of feasting heartily on a late-winter canine blood meal. 
''The vet said the tick didn't settle down until he found a juicy spot on Beau's neck,'' said Mrs. Kowalczyk, 74.
''I was horrified,'' she added. ''It wasn't like we were walking in the forest. We were on the sidewalk, in my neighborhood.''
While entomologists say that the mild weather in much of the country this winter is unlikely to spawn a tick population explosion this spring and summer, they suggest that just like humans and dogs, the pesky critters appear to be enjoying the great outdoors a month or two earlier this year.
''Usually, by late December it's too cold for ticks to be out questing for a blood meal,'' said Richard Pollack, a public health entomologist and instructor in the department of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard School of Public Health.
''Last year at this time, people were sitting in their living rooms watching TV, but now they're out in their neighborhoods, enjoying the warm weather with their dogs and wearing T-shirts,'' Dr. Pollack said.
''It's not that the warm weather has created more ticks,'' he added, ''but it has created the opportunity for both humans and ticks to be more active, and to make contact with each other.''
While some experts say the prevalence of dog-biting ticks this mild winter indicates neither a more virulent tick nor an increased risk of Lyme disease in dogs and humans, a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that data from dogs may help predict areas of Lyme disease emergence. In addition, the study found that combining data from both humans and dogs could assist health officials in targeting Lyme disease prevention efforts.
Though most entomologists decline making any predictions about the coming tick season, Dr. Scott Demanes, a veterinarian from Peoria, Ill., said that ticks this winter had kept him busy treating dogs with tick bites well beyond late fall.
''The whole winter, there's never really been a lull,'' Dr. Demanes said.
''If a dog is not scratching the area a lot, many owners have no idea the dog has a tick bite unless it starts to engorge with blood,'' he said.
At the Bristol County Veterinary Hospital in Seekonk, Mass., Dr. Amy Hurd recommends that all dogs be tested annually for Lyme disease. She also worries that the bleak economy has led some pet owners to forgo buying the protective lotions that ward off ticks.
''Times are hard for a lot of people these days, and for some pet owners, tick lotion can seem like a luxury -- they just don't have the money,'' Dr. Hurd said.
''There are a lot of choices to make, but with the warm winter weather we've just had, dog owners should be applying a tick lotion and checking their dogs every day,'' Dr. Hurd said.
Of course, even the most vigilant pet owners can discover that despite their best efforts, they have not eluded the ever intrepid and terribly tiny tick. Aggie Hozempa of Warren, R.I., and her yellow Labrador retriever, Libby Lane -- one of Dr. Hurd's patients -- both received a diagnosis of Lyme disease contracted from tick bites in November.
''I had severe pain in my right knee, and when an M.R.I. ruled out an injury, the doctor ran a blood test, and I tested positive for Lyme disease,'' Ms. Hozempa said. ''Dr. Hurd tested Libby Lou, and it was the same story, but my dog had zero symptoms.''
Both Ms. Hozempa and Libby Lane were treated with doxycycline and are now healthy and symptom-free, resuming their daily walks, covered with a protective tick lotion and never straying from a paved bike path.
''As a golfer, if on occasion my ball ends up in the woods, I will not go and get it,'' Ms. Hozempa said. ''Tick bites and Lyme disease are just so bizarre and frightening. I'm trying to be proactive, but these ticks are like the size of a pepper flake. The wind can blow one on you or your dog, and you'd never know it.''

HEADLINE: Falling In And Out of War

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER

 BODY:
WHEN you've been wrong about something as important as war, as I have, you owe yourself some hard thinking about how to avoid repeating the mistake. And if that's true for a mere kibitzing columnist, it's immeasurably more true for those in a position to actually start a war.
So here we are, finally, messily winding down the long war in Afghanistan and simultaneously being goaded toward new military ventures against the regimes in Syria and Iran. Being in the question-asking business, I've been pondering this: What are the right questions the president should ask -- and we as his employers should ask -- when deciding whether going to war is (a) justified and (b) worth it? Here are five, plus two caveats, and some thoughts about how all this applies to the wars before us.
1. HOW IS THIS OUR FIGHT? 
It ought to be the first question we ask. Sometimes the answer is obvious. There is a broad agreement that it was in America's vital national interest in 2001 to go after the homicidal zealots behind the 9/11 attacks on America, and the Afghan regime that hosted them. Whatever you think of how the war was waged or how long it should continue, the going-in was, as the cops say, a righteous shoot.
Often the American stake is not so clear-cut. We may feel an obligation to defend an ally. (Some allies more than others.) We have been known to fight for our economic interests. We intervene in the name of American values, an elastic rubric that can mean anything from halting a genocide to, in George W. Bush's expansive doctrine, promoting freedom.
Senator John McCain, demanding American air strikes to help rebels topple the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, adopts the Bush ''freedom agenda'' rationale: by halting suffering and helping overthrow tyranny, we earn some leverage with the victors, improving the odds that Syria will become less hostile to our interests. For a variety of robust dissents, look no further than the conservative Web site National Review Online. There you find the neocon view that intervention is not about fomenting a Syrian democracy; it is about striking at an Islamist, anti-American cabal centered on Iran. You also find the libertarian view that our national interest is best served by staying out of a situation we can only make worse.
Nobody said these would be easy questions.
2. AT WHAT COST?
Judged solely by Question No. 1, there is little difference between Libya, where we helped an inchoate mix of rebels overthrow a brutally oppressive regime, and Syria, where we have so far chosen not to help an inchoate mix of rebels overthrow an even more brutally oppressive regime. The critical difference: Syria is much harder. Libya had weak air defenses deployed along the coastline, easily accessible to Western bombers. Syria's defenses are more lethal, more plentiful and spread across inland population centers. ''We'd have to carpet-bomb a path in and out, or risk American pilots being shot down by the regime and used as human shields,'' said John Nagl, a retired Army counterinsurgency expert who teaches at the U.S. Naval Academy. ''We'd be killing a lot more people.''
Cost-benefit analysis may seem a cold-blooded discipline -- you can't put a price on freedom, blah blah blah -- but it is inseparable from the question of our national interests. After more than 10 years of war that have bled our treasury of at least $3 trillion, killed or disabled many thousands of our troops, and created the kind of multiple-rotation stress that invites atrocities and desecrations, every incremental commitment has to be weighed against the cost to our economic security and our readiness to face the next real threat.
Karl Eikenberry, who served in Afghanistan both as a military commander and as ambassador, put it this way: ''If we do not in the future better align ends, ways and means, historians may find that in the aftermath of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan the United States was compelled to contract its global posture similar to the British when they announced their 'East of Suez' policy in the late 1960s.''
3. OR WHAT?
Policy makers should -- and President Obama mostly has -- put a premium on appraising alternatives to war. Most notably, the president has held off an Israeli air assault on Iran's nuclear facilities by mobilizing tough sanctions on Iran's oil and banking industries, and by all but declaring that if Iran gets too close to making nuclear weapons the U.S. will send in the bombs. The sanctions show some signs of working.
The ultimate ''or what'' question about Iran is, if sanctions and threats fail, could we live with a nuclear Iran? Could we trust that like every other nuclear state Iran would be deterred from using its weapons by the certain knowledge that a counterstrike would turn Persia into a wasteland? It's worth serious discussion, but while the idea of containment by deterrence is gaining ground in pundit-land, President Obama can't touch it; to do so would undermine the whole effort to halt Iran's program and, not incidentally, would be hazardous to his reelection.
4. AND WHO ELSE?
In these optional wars, it is useful to have company -- to enhance our moral authority, to amplify the intelligence, to share the cost, to spread the risk -- and to second-guess us. In Libya, we had 17 other nations enforcing a blockade and no-fly zone, Arabs and Turks among them. ''Leading from behind'' may have been a mockable phrase, but it was a serviceable strategy.
In Syria, no one is volunteering to join us yet.
5. THEN WHAT?
This is the question Robert Gates made a mantra at the Defense Department: What happens next? How does this play out? What are the second-order and third-order effects?
One unintended (but foreseeable) consequence of invading Iraq was that it distracted our attention and energy from the far more important undertaking in Afghanistan. Now one possible consequence of rushing too fast for the exits in Afghanistan -- tempting as that may be given the breakdown of Afghan-American trust -- is the increased likelihood that a collapsing Afghanistan would spill into a wobbly Pakistan. In Pakistan there are both numerous nuclear weapons and an abundance of rogue fanatics who would not hesitate to use them.
Syria, says Nagl, is another good place to think hard about collateral chaos: ''The hard part is not toppling Assad, it's what comes afterwards. Everybody raise your hands if you're up for another occupation of an Islamic country.''
My first caveat is public opinion, which no democracy can ignore. Fighting wars is not something you do by poll. Public opinion can be wrong. It lagged behind F.D.R. before World War II; it was riding along enthusiastically with President Bush when he invaded Iraq. But public opinion puts a thumb on the scale. The U.S. used force to stop a genocide in Bosnia, but did not in Rwanda or Darfur -- one critical difference being that Americans (and American TV screens) were paying attention to the European slaughter, but not to the African atrocities.
My second caveat is that asking the right questions only works if you are prepared to hear answers you might not like. Sometimes our leaders start with the answers and work backward, fixing the facts to the policy, as the head of Britain's MI6 said of the Potemkin intelligence used to sell the invasion of Iraq. To pick just one example from the no-fact zone of Republican primary season, Rick Santorum, the most hawkish of the Republican candidates on Iran, keeps suggesting that Iran's nuclear program is not under international inspection. It's possible that Iran has hidden away some facility we don't know about, but everything we know about -- that is, everything we would bomb if we decided to attack -- is monitored by international inspectors.
If Iraq taught us nothing else, it should have taught us this: Before you deploy the troops, deploy the fact-checkers.

HEADLINE: U.S. May Restrict Mortgages on Properties Leased for Oil and Gas Drilling

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

 BODY:
The Department of Agriculture is considering requiring an extensive environmental review before issuing mortgages to people who have leased their land for oil and gas drilling.
Last year more than 140,000 families, many of them with low incomes and living in rural areas, received roughly $18 billion in loans or loan guarantees from the department under the Rural Housing Service program. Much of the money went to residents in states that have seen the biggest growth in drilling in recent years, including Pennsylvania, Texas and Louisiana.
The program is popular because it generally requires no down payment. As its financing has grown and credit markets have tightened in recent years, the program's loans have roughly quadrupled since 2004. 
The decision, agriculture officials say, would also affect the department's Rural Business and Cooperative program, which issued more than $1 billion in loans and grants last year to about 15,000 rural businesses.
Home mortgages and rural business loans from the agency have been allowed to avoid such reviews, except under unusual circumstances.
The proposal by the Agriculture Department, which has signaled its intention in e-mails to Congress and landowners, reflects a growing concern that lending to owners of properties with drilling leases might violate the National Environmental Policy Act, known as NEPA, which requires environmental reviews before federal money is spent. Because that law covers all federal agencies, the department's move raises questions about litigation risks for other agencies, legal experts said.
Drilling for gas has become more common using a technique known as hydraulic fracturing, which breaks up rock deep underground using water and chemicals under high pressure. The drilling has been an economic boon -- creating jobs and reducing dependence on foreign energy. But it has raised concerns about contamination of water wells, air pollution and above-ground spills.
Over the last year, some banks and federal agencies have started revisiting their lending policies to account for the potential impact of drilling on property values.
''We will no longer be financing homes with gas leases,'' Jennifer Jackson, program director for rural loans in the Agriculture Department's New York office, wrote in an internal e-mail this month, citing several factors, including the costs of conducting such reviews.
In e-mails sent to landowners and Congress, agriculture officials said that environmental specialists at the agency believed that the reviews were legally necessary and that leased properties should not be given special exemptions. But when asked about the notice, the Agriculture Department said its secretary, Tom Vilsack, is still reviewing it.
Legal experts said that the agency's notice would have broad repercussions.
The environmental reviews being proposed by the Agriculture Department would give the public a fuller accounting of the potential environmental risks of drilling, the experts said. Such reviews would also help protect the agency from litigation from environmental groups -- a cost that would ultimately be borne by taxpayers.
But the Agriculture Department's notice would also mean that landowners who had already signed leases to allow drilling on their land would face hurdles if they applied for federally backed mortgages.
Full environmental reviews from the Agriculture Department or other agencies would also add new wrinkles to President Obama's plans to expand domestic drilling, the experts said.
Asked for comment, department officials declined to answer specific questions about the notice or about the e-mails, which were sent in February and March by officials from the Agriculture Department's regional offices and its headquarters. The e-mails were provided to The New York Times by Congressional staff members and landowners.
Other Agriculture Department officials, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to reporters, said that the notice was technically not a policy change but a clarification of existing rules. The notice was being issued partly in response to growing questions from state offices about whether agency loans for properties with drilling leases complied with federal environmental law, they said.
Officials in some offices, especially in the West, where drilling has been occurring for decades, said they had historically given categorical exclusions to properties with drilling leases. But officials in state offices in the East, where drilling has expanded rapidly in recent years, said they wanted more guidance on whether bypassing environmental reviews was legal. Next month's clarification from agricultural officials in Washington is meant to settle that dispute.
Edward Lloyd, an environmental law professor at Columbia, noted that billions of dollars worth of home loans are made directly or underwritten each year by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Housing Administration and the Veterans Administration. He said those lenders might feel compelled by the Agriculture Department's decision to study their own policies.
Professor Lloyd and two other legal experts predicted that rather than assessing the impact from each oil and gas lease separately, the Agriculture Department and other federal agencies may instead prepare a blanket environmental review of drilling that applies to all of their lending programs.
Kevin T. K. Bailey, a Congressional liaison with the Agriculture Department, said in e-mails sent to Representatives Maurice D. Hinchey and Carolyn B. Maloney, both Democrats from New York, that the agency was willing to conduct such a review, but there was no money in the budget for it, so lending would need to stop until the matter was resolved.
Agriculture officials said the notice was in response to an article in The Times in October that described how leases often allowed certain activities, like storing hazardous waste on a property, that were expressly forbidden by mortgages because they could harm resale values.
''There is substantial controversy over the extent, range, and issues associated with hydraulic fracturing (fracking) for gas,'' Mr. Bailey wrote in a March 8 e-mail to members of Congress, adding that ''for a number of years'' the loan program typically had considered its mortgages exempt from environmental review. But the agency notice will clarify that this is not the case for properties with drilling leases.
Requiring environmental reviews for such properties will be slow but will allow the public to have more say in the matter, he added.
''Approval of such leases would allow for a number of potential impacts to possibly occur which would need to be analyzed in a NEPA document that would be reviewed by the public for sufficiency,'' he wrote.
''The overall environmental effects of such development have not been addressed in any NEPA document by any federal agency,'' he said, adding that allowing people with drilling leases on their properties to qualify automatically for mortgages from the Agriculture Department ''places the Agency at risk of NEPA related litigation.''

PERSON: Peter Novick 

HEADLINE: Peter Novick, 77, Author of Holocaust Book

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Peter Novick, a history professor at the University of Chicago who stirred controversy in 1999 with a book contending that the legacy of the Holocaust had come to unduly dominate American Jewish identity, died on Feb. 17 at his home in Chicago. He was 77.
The cause was lung cancer, his wife, Joan, said. 
Dr. Novick -- ''a nonobservant Jew,'' according to his wife -- was the author of ''The Holocaust in American Life,'' in which he asked why the Nazi genocide had ''come to loom so large'' and ''whether the prominent role the Holocaust has come to play in both American Jewish and general American discourse is as desirable a development as most people seem to think it is.''
He was skeptical that it was, and 10 years of research, he added, ''confirmed the skepticism.''
Dr. Novick did not deny the enormity of the Holocaust or suggest that it should be forgotten. But he contended that at a time of increasing assimilation, intermarriage and secularization, it had become ''virtually the only common denominator of American Jewish identity in the late 20th century.''
The Holocaust, as he saw it, was also being used for political ends. That was particularly true, he said, after the Six-Day War in 1967 and the Yom Kippur War in 1973 had heightened fears of Israel's vulnerability.
''After 1967, and particularly after 1973, much of the world came to see the Middle East conflict as grounded in the Palestinian struggle to, belatedly, accomplish the U.N.'s original intention'' of creating two states, he wrote. ''There were strong reasons for Jewish organizations to ignore all this, however, and instead to conceive of Israel's difficulties as stemming from the world's having forgotten the Holocaust. The Holocaust framework allowed one to put aside as irrelevant any legitimate grounds for criticizing Israel.''
Dr. Novick's book drew wide and varying reactions from reviewers and academicians.
In his review of the book in The New York Times, Lawrence L. Langer, a scholar of Holocaust literature at Simmons College in Boston, was unconvinced by Dr. Novick's contentions. ''Novick rightly slights formulaic responses to the Holocaust,'' he wrote, ''from the ubiquitous but vacuous 'Never again!' to the periodic manipulations of popular sympathy by some Jewish organizations when they fear a rise in anti-Semitism or a decline in support for Israel. But the abuse of the Holocaust for political or emotional ends does not discredit the continuing significance of the atrocity itself, as a human catastrophe and an example of vast evil in our time.''
Eva Hoffman, the writer and literary scholar, writing in The New York Review of Books, was more supportive. She noted that the book had been ''criticized for the harshness and alleged 'cynicism' of its tone'' and acknowledged that it was ''indeed a tough-minded work, sharp, brusque, and sometimes nearly Swiftian in its acerbities.'' But, she added, ''the anger is a measure of Novick's involvement; his candor is part of the argument. Novick is clearly intent on cutting through the circumlocutions of habitual Holocaust discourse, on challenging what he sees as its obfuscations with uncompromising logic and saying out loud what is often intimated in private.''
Jan Goldstein, a friend and colleague of Dr. Novick's at the University of Chicago, recalled that ''very often historians of Jewish background would take the thesis as an attack on American Jews.''
''He was regarded by some as a self-hating Jew,'' Dr. Goldstein said of Dr. Novick, ''which he was definitely not.''
In 2000, The Economist cited Dr. Novick's book as the ''starting point'' for a far more controversial one, ''The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering,'' in which the author, Norman G. Finkelstein, contended that the Holocaust was being exploited for personal, political and economic reasons.
Ms. Novick recalled the uproar over her husband's book. ''Some people hated the book,'' she said. ''People said: 'This is a bad thing. You're saying the Holocaust was not the most horrible thing in the world.' ''
Still, she added, ''Unbeliever that he was, Peter found strong supporters among many rabbis -- liberals to Orthodox -- who shared his concern that the Holocaust might replace religion as the central symbol of Jewishness.''
Peter Novick was born in Jersey City on July 26, 1934, to Michael and Esther Novick. His grandparents immigrated to the United States from Eastern Europe in the 1890s. After serving in the Army, Dr. Novick received his bachelor's degree in 1957 and his doctorate in 1965, both from Columbia University. Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, Michael.
Dr. Novick joined the University of Chicago faculty in 1966 and retired in 1999. His specialty was historiography, the study of the techniques of historical research, and even here he challenged orthodoxies.
In his 1988 book, ''That Noble Dream: The 'Objectivity Question' and the American Historical Profession,'' he questioned the idea of objectivity itself in historical research. Tracing its development, he wrote that history was long considered a kind of literary genre until the late 19th century, infused with an author's point of view. That changed when the prevailing ideal became fact-based documentation without preconception. Dr. Novick was again skeptical, believing that the ''myth of objectivity breaks down,'' as Dr. Goldstein put it -- ''that there is no such thing as a fact in isolation from a preconceived theory or narrative.''
Of the criticism of his Holocaust book, Dr. Novick told the Chicago Tribune in 1999: ''I knew I'd get some static and controversy on this,'' adding that the reaction was ''divided between those who say, 'Right on!' and those who are scandalized and outraged.''
''They don't just pay me here for the teaching I do,'' he said. ''I produce scholarship.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Better Forecasts From the Cloud

BYLINE: By QUENTIN HARDY

 BODY:
Someday soon, the Federal Reserve may be dead, at least for economic information. Blame it on, or credit it to, cloud computing.
I recently visited the Oakland, Calif., headquarters of GT Nexus, a company that monitors supply chain information - things like ordering, payment, manufacture and logistics - for 100 major companies. Think of GT Nexus as a Facebook for corporate behavior: business partners are friends, and the completion of tasks are status updates.
The clients inside this cloud-based system include Home Depot, Sears Holdings, Adidas, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett-Packard and Fiat Industrial. Each giant company typically has about 1,000 other organizations involved in its business, including suppliers and manufacturers, freight companies, customs officials and banks. GT Nexus keeps straight all their goods, services and the payments involved, in real time, on a cloud-based computing platform. It is possible because so many people, things and computers are now connected to the Internet. 
Using a laptop, I saw a $270 pair of Adidas soccer shoes was ordered in the United States on Oct. 25, manufactured in Lianjiang, China, on Dec. 25 at 04:00 Pacific time, and air-freighted to the United States on Jan. 6. I saw 4,941,554 units of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax were sent from Pfizer's Puerto Rico factory to Narita airport in Japan, at a temperature appropriate to keep the drugs safe, ahead of the tsunami anniversary.
I saw that investors in Mauritius had bought Caterpillar's largest truck, and shipped it (in pieces, to avoid taxes) to South Africa, where it was assembled for final delivery to a mining project in Congo. I zoomed up a level, and looked at thousands of container cargoes as they moved around the planet.
As thrilling, or geeky, as that may sound, something important is going on. GT Nexus can abstract all the data among all these supply chains into one really big picture, and get a remarkably clear view of all kinds of real-time world activity.
Its customers have total revenues that amount to $500 billion, about 2 percent of the world's gross domestic product. You can take a number like that and start to extrapolate an overall picture of the economy. In fact, that is exactly what economists at the Federal Reserve and the Commerce Department do, though not quite as slickly, when they crank out those all-important numbers on economic growth and gross domestic product.
Looking at the activity of cargo shipments over several years, we saw flat activity in the recession year of 2009, then an increase (compared with a year earlier) in August 2010. That was from companies ordering goods ahead of the Christmas season, though they waited until the last minute because they were not yet confident that the consumer would shop. In 2011, the activity began as early as May, indicating the big companies felt more confident.
So far this year, things are above last year's levels, and payments are made relatively quickly, indicating the economy is still doing well.
Take a purchase order, say from J.C. Penney, for clothing by Under Armour; the clothing is manufactured overseas and shipped to the United States. That order, mixed with the orders from many more retailers, provides a snapshot of expectations about how much and what people will buy, 270 days before the products are in stores. Can a government economist do that?
As GT Nexus, and companies like it, build out these kinds of systems, their information becomes more telling about the whole world. ''Globalization was instrumental to our growth,'' says Aaron Sasson, GT Nexus's founder and chief executive, who has spent 13 years and $30 million of the money he and his brother made selling another software company. ''China was very popular five years ago. Now customers are moving to Vietnam, Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, wherever the costs are lower. We just move the system with them.''
Mr. Sasson has not yet made a product from all this data, but sees the possibility. Customers are not used to sharing their information so readily, and he needs to build trust. Recently 45 companies contributed their data in order to figure out the average time a cargo stayed in port. Should they choose to pool all their data, however, they could have one of the most powerful and reliable economic indicators. If they published it, the world would pay attention, even if the companies themselves got, say, a 30-minute lead time on the release of the info.
It is also possible to merge different databases and model future consumption, a feature that could someday shape corporate and government policy. In one scenario, a shipment from Shenzhen to Chicago was modeled for different pollution outcomes, depending on whether it was sent via the ports of Los Angeles; Tacoma, Wash.; or Norfolk, Va., as well as the total carbon produced by the ship, rail cars and trucks used along the way. In an ideal world, a route through Tacoma, which used a lot of rail in the United States, produced the least carbon. But since many of the rail cars were reserved, another database chimed in, the Tacoma shipment would actually require a lot of dirty trucking. Long Beach, Calif., worked better.
It is not clear that GT Nexus has this market won. As they build out their clouds, companies like SAP and Oracle may be able to deliver similar insights across industries and economies, in something near real time. The greatest challenge may be in teaching their customers to share data, because the computer technology, from sensors at the edge to big servers in the cloud, is already in place.
Often enough, successful technologies change society itself. This kind of cloud-based information is rapidly creating huge pools of data in real time, which can be related to other pools of information like never before.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Hawks Steering Debate on How To Take On Iran

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU and MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Even before President Obama declared this month that ''I have Israel's back'' in its escalating confrontation with Iran, pro-Israel figures like the evangelical Christian leader Gary L. Bauer and the conservative commentator William Kristol were pushing for more.
In a slickly produced, 30-minute video, the group that the two men lead, the Emergency Committee for Israel, mocked Mr. Obama's ''unshakable commitment to Israel's security'' and attacked his record on Iran as weak. ''I'll be brutally honest: I don't trust the president on Israel,'' Mr. Bauer, who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, said in an interview. ''I think his record on Israel is abysmal.''
With Israeli leaders warning of an existential threat from Iran and openly discussing the possibility of attacking its nuclear facilities, pro-Israel groups on all sides have mobilized to make their views known to the Obama administration and to Congress. But it is the most hawkish voices, like the Emergency Committee's, that have dominated the debate, and, in the view of some critics, pushed the United States closer to taking military action against Iran and another war in the Middle East. 
''It's not about Israel,'' said Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, the House majority leader and a key Congressional ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.
''It's about the U.S.,'' Mr. Cantor said in an interview. ''It's about our interests in the region. There have been a lot of conflicting messages coming out of the White House.''
Among those advocating a more aggressive approach toward Iran are prominent Republicans in Congress, like Mr. Cantor and Senator John McCain of Arizona; the party's presidential candidates; groups like the Emergency Committee and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or Aipac; the so-called ''neocons'' from the George W. Bush administration who were strong proponents of the war in Iraq; pro-Israel evangelical Christians like Mr. Bauer, who is also active in the group Christians United for Israel; and many Democrats.
Urging diplomacy are liberal groups like J Street, which is helped by $500,000 a year in contributions from the liberal philanthropist George Soros, and Tikkun, a Jewish journal that has begun running newspaper advertisements here and abroad that urge, ''NO War on Iran and NO First Strike!'' Tikkun, based in Berkeley, Calif., is hoping to link its antiwar message with the Occupy protests.
''A lot of people talk about the 'Israel lobby' as if it's a monolithic thing,'' said Dylan Williams, head of government affairs for J Street. ''It's a myth. There is a deep division between those who support military action at this point and those who support diplomacy.''
Clear fissures have developed among pro-Israel groups -- not only between hawks and doves over whether to use military force against Iran, but among hard-liners themselves over just how aggressively to confront it.
Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino owner who is a staunch supporter of Israel, was once a major donor to Aipac. But because of Aipac's support for American aid to the Palestinian Authority, he has broken from the group. This year, Mr. Adelson has given at least $10 million, along with his wife, to support Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign.
Like Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum, Mr. Gingrich has pushed for stronger support of Israel and attacked Mr. Obama's policies on the Iranian issue as weak. He also described the Palestinians as an ''invented people.''
The disagreements over what to do about Iran reflect the divisions among Jews themselves. In a survey of American Jews last September by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group, 56 percent of those polled said they would support American military action against Iran if diplomacy and sanctions failed, while 38 percent opposed it. Support was down slightly from a year earlier.
Rabbi Michael Lerner, a leader of Tikkun and an affiliated antiwar coalition of religious groups, said backers of diplomacy want to slow what they have seen as a ''drumbeat to war'' in recent weeks. Rabbi Lerner and other opponents of military action say the debate over Iran echoes the political climate in 2002 before the United States-led invasion in Iraq.
Representative Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who opposes military action against Iran, said, ''The rhetoric is overblown.''
Those advocating military intervention ''whip up fear and whip up doomsday scenarios,'' Mr. Ellison said in an interview. ''It has an effect. If nothing else, they're making Obama talk about military options with regard to Iran.''
But Mr. Ellison is in the minority on Capitol Hill, where the debate over Israel and Iran was largely settled long ago.
Even in the oft-divided Senate, a measure last fall to impose tough economic sanctions on Iran passed 100-0 despite White House concerns. Beyond antiwar activists like Mr. Ellison and the recently defeated Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat, or neo-isolationists like Representative Ron Paul of Texas, the Republican presidential candidate, there is almost no constituency in either party for anything other than tougher sanctions against Iran and clear expressions of solidarity with Israel.
In the standoff with Iran, it is the hawkish groups supporting military action that wield more money, political clout and high-profile names than do the advocates of a diplomatic solution.
In all, pro-Israel political action committees and donors affiliated with them have given more than $47 million directly to federal candidates since 2000, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. They rank among the top contributors to a number of prominent Democrats and Republicans, and pro-Israel groups have hosted many lawmakers on expense-paid trips to Israel. When Aipac featured Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu at its conference this month, more than half the members of Congress attended.
Richard N. Perle, an influential neoconservative voice who served as a senior Defense official in the Bush administration, said he saw a growing ''sense of urgency'' among Republicans over the need to consider all options -- including military intervention -- to stop Iran from developing a nuclear bomb that could be used against Israel. The ''noisy public debate'' has now made military operations more politically viable for Mr. Obama, he said in an interview.
The president himself has warned against ''loose talk of war'' in the public debate over Iranian policy, even as he has left open the possibility of military action. At the Aipac conference, Mr. Obama reassured Israeli officials and supporters that he had ''Israel's back.'' He referred explicitly to military action as an option for dealing with Iran and rejected a policy of containment. The harder line that Mr. Obama articulated also happens to be good domestic politics, according to experts. The president's statements, they said, calmed the jitters of some Jewish voters about his support for Israel and defused the effort of Republican presidential candidates to use Iran as a wedge issue against him.
Steve Rabinowitz, who served in the Clinton administration and now advises Jewish groups, said that an issue that Republicans ''hoped would be a major weapon in turning Jews against the president was all but taken away from them.''

HEADLINE: Drifting Right, Illinois Is Test For Romney

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Steven Yaccino contributed reporting from Chicago, and Jeff Zeleny from Moline, Ill.

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Illinois has been known for choosing Republicans of a moderate brand, in the mold of James R. Thompson, the state's longest serving governor, or Mark Steven Kirk, the United States senator elected in 2010. So for Mitt Romney, who has had to defend himself against the moderate label elsewhere, a primary here -- with its large prize of delegates and the symbolism of President Obama's backyard -- would seem a welcome, natural fit.
And yet, while Mr. Romney has a crucial strategic advantage for gaining delegates on Tuesday and an overwhelming list of establishment Republicans on his side, Illinois is not shaping up to be the effortless romp some had presumed. A Chicago Tribune/WGN-TV poll showed Mr. Romney ahead of Rick Santorum, but only by 4 percentage points, within the margin of sampling error.
Mr. Romney swept through the state on Sunday from Moline, on the western edge, to the Chicago suburbs before spending the night in Springfield. He has placed enough importance on Illinois to spend four days here leading up to the primary. 
He and his allies are also greatly outspending his rivals, with one voter reporting receiving three recorded calls from Romney forces in a single day. Mr. Santorum spent Saturday in the state and will return Monday for a full day of campaigning.
Some Republicans say this state's political inclinations are simply shifting, giving a more conservative bloc a far louder voice and leaving them wondering whether that old Illinois stalwart, the middle-of-the-road Republican, is obsolete.
Republicans in the state certainly have cause for excitement -- this is the first Illinois primary in decades that could significantly influence who becomes the presidential nominee. But Mr. Romney also seems to be struggling here with something he has battled everywhere: a failure, voters say, to thrill.
''Mitt Romney is a sound individual and a good businessman, but from a sheer lovability or enthusiasm standpoint, he's not the world's most gregarious guy,'' said Kirk Dillard, a longtime Republican state senator who has not committed to any particular candidate as he did in other years, like 2008, when he ran as a delegate for Senator John McCain. ''That's not to say there's anything wrong with that. Maybe that's what we need right now.''
Jim Edgar, a former Republican governor who also fits the state's classic moderate model, has chosen to hold back from making an endorsement in the presidential race even though he has always done so in the past. He said he had reservations about some positions of each of the candidates, but of Mr. Romney, he noted, ''I haven't detected, down in the ranks, that kind of enthusiasm,'' adding, ''There just doesn't yet seem to be the interest.''
The densest Republican territory in this state falls outside Chicago -- in the swelling suburban counties that form a collar around the city and in the wide open, sometimes corn-filled stretches south of Interstate 80, an east-west road that splits Chicago and the state's northern cap from everything else. Mr. Romney is expected to draw strength from Chicago's suburbs, while Mr. Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul have been popular downstate, where conservatives are concentrated.
Still uncertain: who will show up to vote in larger numbers -- the state's conservative wing, which says it is far more fired up about this campaign, or its more traditional moderates, people like Mike Kenyon, chairman of the Republican Central Committee in suburban Kane County, who had this to say on Mr. Romney's behalf: ''Can you find anything bad about him?''
Illinois has been battered in the struggling economy. The unemployment rate -- 9.4 percent in January -- is higher than the national average and the worst of any state in the Midwest, including Michigan. Meanwhile, the state has had its own budget woes, including unpaid bills and a woefully underfinanced pension plan.
All that may benefit Mr. Romney's campaign, given his background -- a fact that Mr. Romney's strongest supporters are quick to point out. ''You need someone with business strengths,'' said Tom Cross, the minority leader in the Illinois House of Representatives, who is backing Mr. Romney. ''This is going to be about the economy, you know.''
Yet this is a state so deeply different from one end to the other that Mr. Romney's background may also damage him.
''I'm tired of rich guys running for office because it's a mountain to be climbed for them,'' said Tony Libri, chairman of the Sangamon County Republican Central Committee, in central Illinois, who said he had yet to decide who he will vote for but expects that Mr. Romney will ultimately be the nominee. ''He probably spends more on a shirt or a haircut than most Americans make in a week. I want a guy who can roll up his sleeves and talk about being on the front lines in Afghanistan or being a welder on a factory floor.''
For decades, Illinois's simple model for a successful, statewide Republican candidate -- moderate, especially on social issues -- seemed to hold. But tension has long simmered among those who favored a more conservative approach. Signs of a shift within the party appeared as early as 1996, when Al Salvi -- now Mr. Santorum's honorary co-chairman in Illinois -- defeated a lieutenant governor for the Republican nomination for a United States Senate seat. (Mr. Salvi went on to lose in a general election to Richard J. Durbin, the Democrat who still holds the seat.)
More recently, with rising frustration over the economy, the tension has boiled over here.
''The advent of the Tea Party has really changed the dynamics of the party in Illinois,'' said Jon Zahm, the state director of Mr. Santorum's campaign. ''The old story just isn't so anymore.''
Ordinary voters spoke of their own evolutions.
''Because of the direction our country is going, I've moved more to the right,'' said Linda Givilancz, who said she considered herself a proud Tea Party supporter who will vote for Mr. Gingrich on Tuesday. She said she had shifted significantly after 2008, and particularly after the passage of the health care bill. ''That's when I said, 'Holy cow, there's something drastically wrong.' ''
Even if Mr. Santorum were to upset the presumptions and the polls and win the state's so-called beauty contest on one part of the ballot, he could not sweep the delegates. He starts with a major disadvantage, a shaky sign of his team's organizing abilities in Illinois. While 54 delegates are at stake on Tuesday, Mr. Santorum is the only candidate among the four who will be competing for only 44 of them.
In three of the state's 18 Congressional districts, Mr. Santorum's allies failed to line up delegates by the deadline, and in a fourth district -- in what Mr. Salvi described as a ''crazy situation'' and Mr. Zahm described as ''human error'' by a volunteer -- petitions for delegates were ready to be filed but were inadvertently thrown out instead.
If Democrats in this, Mr. Obama's adopted home state, sound especially passionate about him, Republicans here seem that much more disturbed by his tenure, as if proximity has carried a special sting. Whatever the outcome on Tuesday, Republican say, one thing is certain: they will eagerly unite around the nominee -- thrilled or not.
''I would vote for a dog just to get Obama out,'' Charles Falk, 74, said at a Lincoln Day dinner for Republicans in Palatine, where Mr. Gingrich appeared and spoke. Come November, Mr. Obama is expected to glide to victory in Illinois, so Tuesday may be the last anyone here sees of a Republican presidential candidate for another long while.

HEADLINE: Romney Prevails Easily in Puerto Rico Primary

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
VERNON HILLS, Ill. -- Mitt Romney hailed his victory on Sunday in the Puerto Rico primary as another step in a slow march to the Republican presidential nomination, a winning streak he is aggressively working to repeat here in the Illinois primary on Tuesday.
As the Republican race deepens into a fight for every delegate, the Romney campaign pointed to Puerto Rico as the latest sign of strength over Rick Santorum. Mr. Romney soundly defeated Mr. Santorum in the United States territory, which has 20 delegates, and all are likely to go to Mr. Romney. 
''Those people who think Latinos won't vote for a Republican need to talk to the people of Puerto Rico,'' Mr. Romney said, speaking at an evening rally here. ''I intend to get Latino voters to vote Republican and take back the White House.''
But the Republican rivals had their sights squarely set on Illinois, where 69 delegates are at stake on Tuesday. The race is far tighter here, party strategists said, and Mr. Romney scrapped a brief island respite to return to campaign across the state on Sunday.
Mr. Santorum, who spent the day making an appeal to Republicans in Louisiana in advance of its primary on Saturday, argued forcefully that he would present a sharper contrast to President Obama than Mr. Romney. He said Sunday that his path to the party's nomination remained open, and that he intended to make his case again here on Monday when he visits the boyhood home of Ronald Reagan in Dixon, Ill.
''We're hanging in there, we're fighting, we're climbing,'' Mr. Santorum said in an interview on the ABC News program ''This Week.'' ''We have got the best message, the best contrast with President Obama.''
Mr. Santorum declined to say how he intended to play the end game of the delegate fight with Mr. Romney, particularly if he blocks his rival from reaching the 1,144 delegates needed to secure the nomination.
The outcome of Illinois will figure heavily in the next chapter of the race, with Mr. Romney outspending Mr. Santorum here to try to slow his momentum from a pair of Southern victories last week.
Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who has pledged to keep his candidacy alive, took a rare break from Sunday television news programs and did not campaign here on the weekend before the primary.
Mr. Romney, who arrived Sunday evening to greet voters in the far northern suburbs of Chicago, is increasingly turning his attention to Mr. Obama. His campaign aides are waging a tenacious fight for delegates, but are trying to keep his message focused on the long-term goal of winning in the fall.
''I think the people of our party want to make sure we have a nominee that can beat Barack Obama,'' Mr. Romney told ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''I know a lot of people will talk about delegates and strategies and math and that's all very interesting to the insiders.''
As he seeks to elevate his message, Mr. Romney is scheduled to deliver a major economic address on Monday at the University of Chicago. Yet his aides were still closely fixated on the chase for delegates.
A few minutes after television networks called the Puerto Rico contest for Mr. Romney, one of his senior campaign advisers, Eric Fehrnstrom, sent a message by Twitter: ''Santorum suffers huge loss in Puerto Rico. He campaigned there and said he was known in Congress as Senator Puertorriqueno.''

HEADLINE: Mayor's Ties to Hometown Fade, But for a Few, They Are Still Felt

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
MEDFORD, Mass. -- David Honeycutt stepped into John Brewer's Tavern, his family's sports bar just outside this blue-collar Boston suburb, days before the start of his senior year at Columbia, tipped off that the mayor of New York was eating lunch beneath a wall covered with Red Sox pennants and big-screen TVs.
Mr. Honeycutt, like Michael R. Bloomberg, had grown up in Medford and moved away for college, seeking a job in finance. Mayor Bloomberg, recognizing a kindred spirit, offered the young man his card; weeks later, in fall 2009, he greeted Mr. Honeycutt at City Hall and arranged an introduction to an executive at a major Wall Street bank.
''It was a pretty cool thing,'' recalled Mr. Honeycutt, who eventually took a job at a Boston investment firm. ''He didn't have to do that.'' 
Mr. Honeycutt is among several residents here whose lives have been directly touched, in modest but often significant ways, by Medford's best-known, and somewhat reluctant, celebrity. Over the years, Mr. Bloomberg has hired a local policeman as a chauffeur, arranged for a music group to meet the conductor of the Boston Pops and paid for a modern, airy redesign at his mother's synagogue.
Yet the mayor's ties to Medford are starting to fade. His mother, Charlotte, whom he visited frequently via private jet, died last year at 102, after living for decades in Mr. Bloomberg's childhood home. He has not been back since, and some here, while grateful for his generosity, wonder whether a man who has long since transformed himself into a New Yorker will now maintain any connection to their town.
''The general take on Mayor Bloomberg and Medford is that Mayor Bloomberg made his money in New York and is very focused on that,'' said Tom Lincoln, a local historian. Benjamin Averbook, 90, a longtime friend of Charlotte Bloomberg, put it more bluntly: ''His mother is gone. He won't be back.''
Mr. Bloomberg, who declined to be interviewed for this article, has not tried to remake Medford in his image: no Bloomberg financial terminals hum in the town library, and the family home remains modest and unadorned, with none of the features of the mayor's more sumptuous real estate in London and in Bermuda. His contributions in town amount to only a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of dollars he gives away annually.
And yet, as Mr. Honeycutt discovered, even a chance encounter with Mr. Bloomberg -- who had been taken to John Brewer's by his mother, a frequent patron -- can transform a life, in ways large and small.
''He bent over backward for my son,'' said Bill Honeycutt, the restaurant's owner and a Medford native himself. ''I could not have been more surprised.''
Michael Rubens Bloomberg moved into the two-story, shingles-and-stone colonial house at 6 Ronaele Road (pronounced RON-a-LEE, or ''Eleanor'' spelled backward) when he was 3. From the start, Medford proved vexing: the Bloombergs had to buy the home from their lawyer to avoid a de facto ban on selling to Jews in the newly developed neighborhood.
As a child, Mr. Bloomberg was a nerdy but middling student, president of the Medford High School slide rule club and briefly in charge of collecting dues from fellow students. In his memoir, he wrote that he was deeply bored, a restless suburban boy dreaming of a grander life in New York. After receiving a diploma in 1960, he seldom looked back, decamping to Baltimore for college and aspiring to a life in Manhattan.
His mother, however, stayed in Medford, providing a continuing link to the town for her son. Mr. Bloomberg, who visited frequently up until her death, often made the round trip to Medford in a day, landing his private plane at nearby Hanscom Air Force Base, where he would be met by a waiting S.U.V. He was sometimes accompanied by close aides, including his press secretary, his political strategist and Patricia Harris, a deputy mayor who attended Mrs. Bloomberg's memorial.
Even from New York, however, he occasionally made his presence known. In 2009, Medford's mayor, Michael J. McGlynn, received a phone call from Mr. Bloomberg's sister, Marjorie Tiven. She was seeking a responsible person to serve as Mrs. Bloomberg's chauffeur.
At Mr. McGlynn's recommendation, the job went to Fran Shea, a Medford native who had retired from the police force after 35 years. Soon, Mr. Shea, driving his own black Mercury sedan, was transporting Mrs. Bloomberg and her two nurses to doctor's appointments, kosher delis, and hair and nail salons in Medford Square. His paychecks were handled in New York by Mr. Bloomberg's personal accountant, Diane Rizzo.
Was it intimidating to be in charge of a billionaire's mother?
''I loved it,'' Mr. Shea said. He would often bring a copy of The New York Post so the mayoral mother could keep up with her son. ''When she passed on, I was really heartbroken,'' he said.
For Patricia Saunders, a local photographer, the Bloomberg moment came in 2008, while she was trying to raise money to rent a performance space for her civic group, the Medford Arts Council. She helped write a letter to Mr. Bloomberg, sent to New York's City Hall, in the hopes that he would support the arts in a town where a famous homegrown artist, the writer Paul Theroux, was a contemporary of Mr. Bloomberg and, like the mayor, had moved away.
A few months after Ms. Saunders wrote, Mr. Bloomberg's staff called. He had decided to donate $25,000. The group was asked not to mention the mayor's name, and when a local paper wrote about the donation, Ms. Saunders received a chastising phone call. (The money has not been spent; Ms. Saunders, citing the recession, said she had been unable to find an affordable rent.)
Last year, after Mrs. Bloomberg died, Mr. Bloomberg encouraged mourners to donate in her memory to the Medford Public Library, where she was a regular patron. The gesture came as a surprise to the library's director, Brian Boutilier, who learned about the mayor's request only when a friend told him.
By January, the library had received $20,000 in donations, doubling its usual annual fund-raising haul. (Several four-figure checks arrived from major New York City corporations.) The money will be used to renovate a moribund children's wing. Mr. Bloomberg's foundation later called and offered to provide additional financing for whatever projects the library had in mind -- up to a point.
''They made it clear that if you asked them for a million dollars, you weren't going to get it,'' said Barbara Kerr, the assistant director, with a laugh.
Not every request from Medford has been accepted. In the late 1990s, Roy E. Belson, the superintendent, asked for a donation to Medford's schools. Ms. Harris, in charge of philanthropy at Bloomberg L.P. at the time, turned him down, saying the company was ''focused on New York and London,'' recalled Mr. Belson, who said he remained an admirer of Mr. Bloomberg.
Since then, however, the mayor has made donations to groups in town, often anonymously. Since 1999, Mr. Bloomberg has given $27,000 to the public schools, $127,000 to a local orchestra of Medford High School alumni and $5,000 for a new outdoor sports complex. He has also given $1.5 million to the synagogue and $100,000 to a local hospital.
The family has helped in smaller ways, too. When Medford students traveled to the Tenement Museum on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Ms. Tiven arranged a tour with the curator, a personal friend.
Some Medford residents, however, perceived a studied distance from Mr. Bloomberg.
There was resentment after a 2009 biography described the mayor's ambivalent feelings toward the town and his eagerness to leave. ''There's no hiding it, some people were put out,'' Mayor McGlynn said.
Today, Mr. Bloomberg's childhood home, currently occupied by his niece, is his last significant tie to his hometown. The house -- at 1,878 square feet, about a sixth of the size of his Upper East Side town house -- has changed little since the mayor's youth. It is well manicured with a single-car garage and a cramped backyard looking onto a busy country road.
Town documents show $85,000 worth of renovations over the last two decades, including an addition behind the garage with a three-panel bay window, similar to the one on the facade of the mayor's East 79th Street town house. Neighbors say they were always treated well. John Pompeo, 51, who lived next door in the 1990s, recalled Charlotte Bloomberg's offering to pay for damage caused during a renovation. ''They ripped up some turf on the lawn, but it was no problem, she fixed it right up,'' he recalled.
In the children's wing at the library, there are plans to install four colorful panels, carved from wood by a local artist, as a memorial to Mrs. Bloomberg.
The library staff is hopeful that the mayor will be able to attend a dedication this year. A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg said he would make the trip, ''as long as there's nothing that the mayor needs to be doing in New York.''

HEADLINE: As Illinois Primary Nears, G.O.P. Rivals Take Different Tacks: Romneys Court Women Alienated by Contraception Issue

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
MOLINE, Ill. -- With the Republican nominating fight turning into a protracted slog for delegates that could potentially last all the way to the convention, Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann, made an appeal on Sunday morning to a coveted group of swing voters in an effort to win the Illinois primary: women.
''I love it that women are upset, too, that women are talking about the economy, I love that,'' Mrs. Romney said at a pancake breakfast here. ''Women are talking about jobs, women are talking about deficit spending. Thank you, women.'' 
The Romney campaign is seeking to repair the political damage with women voters that advisers acknowledge has been inflicted by the Republican nominating fight.
In February, women were evenly divided between Mr. Romney and his chief rival, Rick Santorum. But in the most recent New York Times/CBS News national poll, among Republican primary voters, 41 percent of women backed Mr. Santorum and 27 percent favored Mr. Romney.
Mr. Romney is often introduced by his wife at political events, but her role has taken on greater meaning as the campaign looks ahead to independent voters, particularly women, who polls show have been put off by the candidates' rightward shift on immigration and social issues.
''I'm glad that he's married, and has been married to the same person for a long time and has children,'' said Dawn Parker, 51, a secretary from Freeport, Ill. ''As a woman, I like that. I like that he's a family man, a father and a grandfather.''
Still, Ms. Parker said that she had not yet made up her mind for the primary on Tuesday, but that Mr. Romney was ''a possibility.''
While women are hardly monolithic in their politics, the Romney campaign is urgently trying to shift the conversation back to the economy from more divisive social issues.
That effort was on full display as Mrs. Romney traveled across Illinois with her husband on Sunday. She concluded her speech here in Moline with a direct plea: ''We need you. We all need you in November, too. We have to remember why we're upset and what we've got to do to fix things.''
Mr. Romney's speech on Sunday morning -- which also focused on the economy, the animating force of his campaign -- was more subtle, as he talked about families being hurt by the rising cost of gasoline.
''You've got moms that are driving their kids to school and practice after school and other appointments, and wonder how they can afford putting gasoline in the car, at the same time putting food on the table night after night,'' he said. ''This president doesn't understand the economy.
''He's an economic lightweight, and he's made decisions that have hurt the American people.''
This was not the first time that Mrs. Romney had overtly reached out to women. The campaign understands her potential for wooing women, and it had previously used her, in Iowa, to offer an implicit contrast between her 42-year marriage to Mr. Romney and Newt Gingrich's marital history.
In a speech in Boston on March 6, Super Tuesday, where the discussion leading up to the contests in the 10 states that day had been heavily dominated by issues of contraception, Mrs. Romney addressed the women she said she had been hearing from ''all across this country.''
''Do you know what women care about -- and this is what I love -- women care about jobs,'' Mrs. Romney said at the time. ''Women care about the economy, they care about their children, and they care about the debt.
''And they're angry. They're furious about the entitlement debt that we're leaving our children.''
She concluded: ''So this is what we're hearing when we're out there -- this is our message. It's an economic message, it's about the future for our children, and that's what I'm hearing out there.''

HEADLINE: As Illinois Primary Nears, G.O.P. Rivals Take Different Tacks: Santorum Takes On Urban America, and His Own Party

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

 BODY:
HERRIN, Ill. -- Rick Santorum has accused President Obama of waging class warfare, of dividing America -- ''the 99 versus the one,'' he says.
But campaigning in recent days in Illinois and Missouri, Mr. Santorum has sought to motivate his followers by highlighting a different divide: urban versus rural. And because many of the nation's small towns are suffering economically, Mr. Santorum's approach means he is taking on his own party.
''Think about it, look at the map of the United States -- blue being the Democrats, red being the Republicans -- it's almost all red,'' Mr. Santorum said Saturday evening. ''Except around the big cities. 
''And yet when you look at the economic plan that Republicans put forward, it's all about tax breaks for higher-income individuals who live in those blue areas mostly.''
Mr. Santorum said his proposal for a zero percent corporate tax rate on manufacturing would bring jobs back to small-town America.
In highlighting who would benefit from competing Republican tax proposals, Mr. Santorum seemed to be using urban-rural rivalry as a way to suggest that Mitt Romney, one of his opponents, was the candidate of more liberal city dwellers and that he was the candidate of more conservative rural residents, though polls show that Mr. Romney tends to do well in suburban areas.
At a rally on Friday morning in Osage Beach, Mo., Mr. Santorum complained about ''all of the experts and pundits'' who say that ''we've got to elect someone who's more moderate, someone who can appeal to moderates and independents in New York City and Los Angeles'' and ''Wall Street and corporate boardrooms'' -- groups whose mention drew boos from many in the audience of about 500.
He told the crowd that an analysis -- he did not say whose -- showed that he had ''won 60 percent of the counties throughout the entire course'' of the Missouri contest.
''And if you look at where my Republican opponent has won, it's always in and around the cities,'' Mr. Santorum added, in what seemed to be a clear reference to Mr. Romney, whom he did not mention by name.
''It almost looks like a Republican versus a Democrat, when you look at these states,'' Mr. Santorum said. ''And he's winning the areas the Democrats win, and I win the areas the Republicans win.''
''Does that tell you something, maybe?'' he said to applause.
In fact, Republican nominating contests tend to turn on the voting in suburban and rural areas, where the party is stronger, with Democrats much more dominant in the cities.
Still, Mr. Santorum used the argument to suggest that he, rather than Mr. Romney, could motivate the Republican base to deliver the party a victory in the November general election.
''If we're going to win this election, we have to have a candidate who is going to energize our base, get them excited,'' he said. ''Someone who is authentic. Someone who hasn't taken every side of every issue throughout their political career.''
On Monday, Mr. Santorum was scheduled to barnstorm across Illinois in a last-ditch appeal for support in the primary on Tuesday. He planned to use a statue of Ronald Reagan at the president's boyhood home as a backdrop for his speech in Dixon. Other campaign stops were scheduled in Rockford, Moline and East Peoria.
For Mr. Santorum, a victory in Illinois could help ease doubts about whether he could appeal to voters in more moderate northern states where evangelicals do not have an outsize influence in Republican nominating contests.
He signaled the state's importance during a speech on Saturday afternoon in Effingham.
''This is a pledge,'' Mr. Santorum said. ''If we're able to come out of Illinois with a huge or surprise win, I guarantee you -- I guarantee that we will win this nomination.
''We will nominate a conservative,'' he said, ''and we will beat Barack Obama.''

HEADLINE: For E.V. Drivers, a Stretch of Oregon Interstate to Relieve Range Anxiety

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: The first section of the West Coast Electric Highway opened March 16 in Oregon, along nearly 160 miles of Interstate 5. 

 BODY:
Until better batteries are developed, most electric cars will be range-challenged. But with the opening of the first section of the so-called West Coast Electric Highway on March 16 in Oregon, battery vehicles can travel for longer distances, at least along and immediately beyond the corridor.
Public charging stations are installed at 25-mile intervals on a stretch of Interstate 5 about 160 miles long, extending from Ashland in the south to Cottage Grove. Located off the highway at restaurants, gas stations and other businesses, each charging station includes a 480-volt Level 3 D.C. fast-charger that can get a Nissan Leaf to an 80 percent charge in 20 to 25 minutes, as well as a 220-volt Level 2 charger that takes four to seven hours to fully charge a typical E.V. battery. The Level 2 chargers will be essential for electric cars that lack fast-charge ports, as well as for plug-in hybrids like the Chevrolet Volt.
Eventually, the plug-in network is expected to stretch along Interstate 5 from San Diego to Vancouver, British Columbia. The Oregon highway is being built in part with federal money administered by the state's Transportation Department. When completed, it will link to the other highway legs under construction.
Scott Lilly, general manager of the Vintage Inn Restaurant in Cottage Grove, was told that "at least five" cars had used the inn's station since it opened. "It's a low-risk thing for me, since the stations are occupying some unused space in the back," he said in a telephone interview on Monday. "It's certainly a possibility that it will increase business, and we had quite a bit of traffic related to it over the weekend. People have come in to eat."
The networks in Oregon and, eventually, Washington, will be operated and maintained by the electric infrastructure company AeroVironment, which also developed the chargers. The California portion will be maintained by a handful of companies. Currently, Oregon's charging is free, but users need to sign up for an identification card to use the stations.
The full state highway will be finished early next year, Art James, a senior project executive with the Oregon Transportation Department, said in an interview.
"Oregonians spend nearly $7 billion a year on petroleum products, and all of that leaves the state," he said. "If we can get even 20 percent onto our electric grid, which has an abundance of hydroelectric power as well as wind and solar, it will be a huge economic boon for the state, in addition to the air-quality benefits of having zero-emission vehicles."
Kristen Helsel, AeroVironment's vice president of E.V. solutions, said in an interview that the linked chargers would "change the perception of electric cars as city vehicles that are confined to a local ecosystem."
"When the full interstate network is up, owners with some patience and time on their hands will be able to imagine trips into an even wider world," she added.

HEADLINE: Divided Government and the Investor

BYLINE: ANNIE LOWREY


HIGHLIGHT: A Gallup poll finds "a politically divided federal government" to be the biggest factor hurting the investment climate. 

 BODY:
In a recent survey, Gallup asked people with $10,000 or more in investable assets about the factors hurting the investment climate. The deficit and the unemployment rate ranked highly. But "a politically divided federal government" came in first. 
The investors also said that they felt they had little or no control over their retirement or investment assets, with large majorities citing a dearth of national leadership, wild volatility on Wall Street and the "confrontational political stalemate in the nation's capital" as "major factors" harming their ability to ensure their nest eggs grow.

It is a hard argument to fault. Divided government just makes legislating harder, numerouspolitical sciencestudies have shown. That leads to significant policy uncertainty, which can have a major impact on the economy. 
Last year, for instance, Congress spent weeks bickering over the budget and the United States debt ceiling, causing gyrations in the stock markets, driving down consumer confidence and eventually prompting Standard & Poor's to downgrade United States government debt for the first time. 
This year, it has left open the trillion-dollar question of whether the Bush tax cuts will expire as scheduled at the end of the year. It also looks as if House Republicans may break the budget agreement struck last summer, threatening a fiscal showdown, a government shutdown and another crisis over the debt ceiling. 
No wonder Congress is so unpopular.

HEADLINE: A Start-Up in Greece Ensnarled in Red Tape

BYLINE: THE INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE


HIGHLIGHT: He wanted to start a business selling olive-based products online from Greece - olive oils, cosmetics and the like - and he set about collecting the necessary approvals, stamps and documents. For 10 months he kept at it, even when the Health Department insisted his board members provide lung X-rays and stool samples. So began the tale of Fotis Antonopoulos, a successful Web program designer from Athens, whose olive-oil dream became something of an Orwellian nightmare. 

 BODY:
He wanted to start a business selling olive-based products online from Greece - olive oils, cosmetics and the like - and he set about collecting the necessary approvals, stamps and documents. It took him 10 months, but he kept at it, even when the Health Department insisted his board members provide lung X-rays and stool samples.
So began the tale of Fotis I. Antonopoulos, a successful Web program designer from Athens, whose nightmare of a business dream is chronicled by Suzanne Daley. 
Part of Mr. Antonopoulos's problem, Suzanne writes, might have been his refusal to pay the customary "speed tax" - bribes to move things along.
At one point, his banks insisted that portions of the Olive Shop Web site - including the company's marketing and privacy policies - be written exclusively in Greek, even though his customers would not understand Greek. 
 "We kept trying to tell them that the idea was to export - that customers might be Chinese, and they wouldn't understand," he said, throwing up his hands. "It was useless." 
In the end, Suzanne says, he turned to PayPal to process online payments, which took less than 10 minutes to get him started.
"I laugh about it now," Mr. Antonopoulos says. "But it wouldn't be so funny if I didn't have a very good job with very good pay. It would have been an absolute nightmare." 
From Suzanne's story:
With Greece's economy entering its fourth year of recession, its entrepreneurs are eager to reverse a frightening tide. Last year, at least 68,000 small and medium-size businesses closed in Greece; nearly 135,000 jobs associated with them vanished. Predictions for 2012 are also bleak. 
But despite the government's repeated promises to improve things, the climate for doing business here remains abysmal. In a recent report titled "Greece 10 Years Ahead," McKinsey & Company described Greece's economy as "chronically suffering from unfavorable conditions for business." Start-ups faced immense amounts of red tape, complex administrative and tax systems and procedural disincentives, it said.
Even so, Mr. Antonopoulos said that his story did eventually have a happy ending. His company, up and running for just five months, has already shipped goods to the United States, Argentina, Australia, Japan and even Mongolia, and it is covering its costs. 
"Stool samples cannot be the center of this story," Mr. Antonopoulos said. "We made it."

HEADLINE: Big Data for the Rest of Us, in One Start-Up

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: The Big Data industry is moving from gathering lots of information (via smartphones, sensors and the Web) and putting it in new kinds of unstructured databases. The next step is making it user-friendly to customers in business. ClearStory, a new start-up, shows one way to do it, and also how fast-paced and frothy things have become. 

 BODY:
The best insight into the current state of the Big Data business may be a five-person start-up in Palo Alto, Calif. While the industry mostly gathers lots of data, or stores it in new cloud-based databases, the start-up, ClearStory Data, is building the biggest possible base of data consumers.
ClearStory, which was formed last summer, is making software for ordinary business professionals. These customers will be able to blend their own corporate data with the large amounts of publicly available data, in search of new statistical insights. There just aren't enough statisticians, the company figures, to address the demand corporations will have for Big Data.
 "We're about making data consumable," says Sharmila Shahani-Mulligan, ClearStory's founder and chief executive. "The world is talking about the size of Big Data sources, but at the end of the day it will be about the ease of consumption." Indeed, the McKinsey Global Institutehas projected that the United States needs up to 190,000 people with "analytical expertise" than it has. 
The idea of combining proprietary corporate data with public data is hardly new. Fast-food companies have long looked at census data to figure out where to put outlets, and what to feed people there. The public data sources for ClearStory will largely be the new category of "Data Marts," like Datasift, Factual, the Windows Azure Data Marketplace from Microsoft, andInfochimps. These data marts collectively have perhaps millions of data types, from Twitter feeds to mean temperatures to store locations.
"There aren't enough experts at companies to handle all these data sources," Ms. Shahani-Mulligan says. "Brick-and-mortar stores in the Midwest can't get the kind of data scientists LinkedIn has. We can give them that." The company offers a range of algorithms to wrangle the data. Longer term, ClearStory hopes to get companies to start sharing more of their own internal data too, what Ms. Shahani-Mulligan calls "the gold locked up in 30 years of relational databases."
Drawing off all of the data sources could be powerful, if ClearStory can manage to maintain an even level of quality and reliability among its data sources. That already bedevils many data marts. If ClearStory offers sloppy data to customers, it will hurt the company.
Another challenge will be designing an intuitive Web-based user experience, so the average marketer or communications professional isn't flummoxed by statistics. Good "U.E." people are among the toughest people to find in tech.
ClearStory is a good trend barometer in other ways. The product, which is expected to be ready for public consumption late this summer, will be offered free to casual users. The idea is that enough customers far away from the corporate information technology department will come to depend on ClearStory, and eventually I.T. will want to incorporate a more sophisticated paid version. It is a plan that worked for Yammer, a corporate messaging tool, and Dropbox, with offers storage in the cloud, as well as the Linux operating system. 
Ms. Shahani-Mulligan, a marketing veteran of Netscape, Opsware and Cloudera, is backed by Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz and Khosla Ventures, among others. That makes it one of the more "hot backer-compliant" ventures: Google Ventures specializes in companies with a statistical bent, Andreessen Horowitz is assembling an ecology of companies in cloud computing, and Vinod Khosla is a renowned tech visionary.
Even with backers like that, ClearStory is making itself visible a lot earlier than most start-ups, posing a risk that it will hit the radar of potential competitors even before it has a product. In another sign of the boom (or, possibly, the bubble) in the Big Data industry, ClearStory needs the publicity in order to hire in an increasingly competitive talent market, however.
"There is a war for talent," says Ben Horowitz, ClearStory's backer at Andreessen Horowitz. "Getting the first five people is easy, but the next 20 is hard, when you are selling on your vision and momentum." Besides, he says, "big companies don't react to potential threats. They only react to real threats. There are just too many threats out there."

HEADLINE: Payout on Greek Credit Swaps Is Set

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: The payout on credit default swaps linked to Greece's government bonds was determined on Monday, resolving one of the crucial subplots of the European debt crisis. 

 BODY:
The payout on credit default swaps linked to Greece's government bonds was decided on Monday, resolving one of the crucial subplots of the European debt crisis. 
Using the swaps, investors were able to buy or sell insurance against a Greek default, which occurred earlier this month when the country restructured its debt. An auction held in London on Monday determined that investors who bought protection with the swaps effectively get a payment equivalent to 78.5 percent of the original value of Greece's bonds, with the overall payout amounting to roughly $2.5 billion.
It's an important test for the financial system.
 Credit default swaps typically trade between banks and various parties, and generally don't get routed through clearinghouses and exchanges, which strengthen other parts of the derivatives market. As a result, it's up to regulators and banks themselves to make sure counterparties in swaps can pay the amounts they owe. 
European officials had initially structured Greece's restructuring to avoid a swaps payout, partly because they feared the financial system might react badly to such an event. But the orderly settlement of the Greek swaps indicates that the swaps market is stronger than it was in 2008, when parts of it contributed to the financial crisis. 
Nonetheless, financial reform efforts in the United States and Europe still aim to route most credit default swaps through clearinghouses, which, when functioning properly, can make sure underlying payments on the swaps are being made and are adequate.

HEADLINE: Amid Wall Street Giants, a Firm Thinks Small and Exclusive

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: Three Ocean Partners, founded last December, pledges to take just one account per industry and in some ways represents a return to an earlier Wall Street model. 

 BODY:
When courting new business, Wall Street's deal makers often point to their long client lists as proof of deep industry knowledge. 
Three Ocean Partners takes the opposite approach. The three-month-old boutique firm pitches clients on the promise of exclusivity, pledging to take just one account per industry. 
That strategy makes it virtually impossible for Three Ocean to climb to the top of the prized league tables that tally up the standings in mergers and acquisitions. But the firm's founder, David W. Knowlton, a longtime banker, says the goal is to stay small. "We'll never be a big firm," he said. "We never want to be more than 25 or 30 people." 
In many ways, Three Ocean, which operates out of a historic Art Deco building in Midtown Manhattan, resembles the original Wall Street model, when the industry was dominated by close-knit partnerships. Started last December, the advisory shop now has nine professionals, most of whom will have a personal stake in the firm. Employees are also encouraged to invest in deals. 
The pay packages also echo the past. At a time when investment banks are cutting compensation and shifting to stock bonuses, Three Ocean plans to pay bonuses entirely in cash. It is also offering other perks like unlimited vacation days and monthly wine tastings. 
"For the person who is a true entrepreneur, this is a unique opportunity and structure to do better than Wall Street," said Mr. Knowlton. He said his firm had been fielding hundreds of calls from bankers and headhunters.
Boutique firms - which tend to focus on investment banking - have their own drawbacks. Many small financial firms struggle to pay their overhead while others are dependent on a handful of rainmakers to bring in clients. Kaufman Brothers, a boutique bank founded in 1995, closed this year after a slowdown in deal flow and trading activity.
"When you're on a smaller scale, you have to fight for every deal," said Devin Ryan, a managing director at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. 
But boutiques are gaining traction, capitalizing on big banks' bruised reputations since the financial crisis. The market share of the 10 largest firms, by fees, dropped to 36.3 percent last year, from 42.2 percent in 2007, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
"The industry is suffering from a reputation problem," said Roy Smith, a professor at the Leonard N. Stern School of Business at New York University. "This creates an opportunity for boutiques."
Mr. Knowlton never imagined he would end up on Wall Street. As a teenager in Urbana, Ohio, he planned on running the family's construction business or going into public service. While a student at Kenyon College, he majored in political philosophy and had an internship at the Joint Economic Committee in Washington.
But after graduation, he gravitated toward finance. In late 1980, Mr. Knowlton felt the economy was starting to turn a corner, he said. Eager for some finance experience to apply to the family business, he joined the training program at Manufacturers Hanover Trust, a New York-based bank that ultimately became a part of JPMorgan Chase after a string of mergers. Later, at Chemical Bank, he trained under James B. Lee, the firm's noted deal maker and JPMorgan's current vice chairman, who often told him, "Never tell your client you can't get it done; always find a solution before you go back to the client," Mr. Knowlton said. 
After a stint at Gleacher & Company, Mr. Knowlton started his own firm, Watch Hill Partners, in 2003. Over seven years, the firm - a group of roughly 25 - advised on more than $30 billion of deals, working with Hershey Trust on its attempted takeover of Cadbury and with the Hicks Sports Group on its sale of the Liverpool Football Club. 
In 2009, he sold the business to FBR Capital Markets. But FBR, a larger operation with an equities arm and other units, was ultimately a mismatch for Mr. Knowlton, who wanted to focus solely on mergers and acquisitions. 
"When you sell your firm to another firm, the culture you had inevitably changes," he said. 
Mr. Knowlton, 54, saw Three Ocean as an opportunity to start over again. 
He had three priorities for his new firm: find a patient investor base, focus on a small group of clients and think globally. While the firm is still raising funds, it has signed up several prominent backers, including the Galvins, the founding family of Motorola, and Sanford Robertson, the founder of Robertson, Stephens & Company, a once high-flying technology boutique bank. 
 Three Ocean has five clients, which are considering transactions ranging from $100 million to several billion. One major financial firm has tapped Three Ocean to lead the sale of up to $2 billion worth of assets over the next few years. As the firm was still taking shape, Three Ocean advised MidOcean Partners, a private equity firm, on its $650 million purchase last June of PrePaid Legal Services. 
 While the Three Ocean Partners sales pitch may prove attractive to clients, it also comes with some big challenges.
 Mr. Knowlton, for example, is intent on building a global operation and is establishing a London office. But with a small staff, he can build only so many satellite offices. Instead, Three Ocean will have to rely on international partnerships with other firms, which could come with conflicts. 
Its one company per sector policy means it will miss out on lucrative assignments. Two weeks ago, Mr. Knowlton decided to turn down the opportunity to pitch one business, because it was already courting a competitor. In the end, Three Ocean may not win either deal.
But Mr. Knowlton is willing to give up some opportunities now as he aims to build a long-term business.
"We'll have to turn down business, even if a bigger company comes along," he said. "If we won both deals, it would breach what we stood for."

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: Follow the Titanic!

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Plus: Have you read anything interesting or inspiring lately? 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my business and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: Finding Work in Austin
Couldn't make it to Austin's South by Southwest? Here are some of the big ideas that came out of the conference. David Crandall shares all of his insights. Doritos introduced a 56-foot-tall vending machine. BrandYourself.com won the best bootstrapped start-up award. Highlight was the most talked about app. Megan Garber says turning the homeless into hotspots wasn't as horrible as it looked. Unfortunately, you missed the most innovative man there.
The Economy: Optimism Edges Up
Small-business optimism edges up but is still way below historical levels. The Federal Reserve concludes that conditions are improving. Robert Oak says the unemployment picture is still not rosy. But Paul Wiseman offers seven reasons the job gains could last. CBIZ sees a slight rebound in small-business employment. State unemployment rates were generally lower last month. The Employment Trends Index reaches a three-and-a-half year high. A Manpower report says employers are planning to increase hiring during the next three months. Auto suppliers are booming and facing a labor shortage. John Carlucci says the $OEXA200R is the best stock market indicator ever. Export and import prices continue to moderate. The United States is now the world's top producer of natural gas.
The Data: Mixed Numbers From February 
The Ceridian Fuel Index suggests a "recovery in home building has not yet taken hold." Rising fuel costs are starting to burn some small businesses, and Mike Shedlock reports another plunge in the three-month rolling average of petroleum and gasoline use. In February, manufacturing sales and inventories (pdf) were up, retail sales increased, rail traffic was mixed and producer prices (pdf) and Los Angeles port traffic declined. Public transportation ridership was up in 2011, but this man should have taken the bus. Using data from LinkedIn, here's a summary of growth rates by industry between 2007 and 2011. You can follow the journey of the Titanic on Twitter.
Management: Get L.B.J.'s Advice
Ralph Hershberger says to check these three measures of profitability. A few business owners share their favorite Web sites. Stacy Conradt tells the 11 best customer service stories ever. Michael Koploy recommends these warehouse retrofits to reduce energy consumption. David Robinson lists a few simple ways to turn a small business green. Noobpreneur.com explains how to be an ethical business. Glen Blickenstaff lists eight steps to acquiring a business. Brett and Kate McKay explain how to build a cabinet of invisible counselors: "You might loathe L.B.J.'s politics and personal life but really admire his skill as a tough negotiator and thus bring him into your cabinet to advise you on that point."
People: The Top Five Mistakes
Here are the top five mistakes employers make and how to avoid them. Warren Rutherford suggests six hiring practices. The first two days of the N.C.A.A. Tournament mean productivity losses of $175 million, and Consumerist's own March Madness competition will crown the worst company in America. Sarah Kliff wonders if workplace wellness programs will work. An op-ed from a former Goldman Sachs employee wipes out $2.15 billion of market value. Daisy Grewal (finally!) explains that interacting with a woman can leave a guy cognitively impaired. Here's why some executives fear a leadership shortage. A Little League coach will probably spend more time teaching his pitchers how to throw an intentional walk.
Start-Up: Fred Wilson's Curve
This start-up is vying for shelf space as part of a Wal-Mart contest. Alex Loddengaard shares 10 differences between working at a start-up versus at a big company, like: "Mark Zuckerberg would have never been given a C.E.O. role at a big company he started working for after college." Mark Schaefer interviews Eric Ries, author of "The Lean Start-Up." Older entrepreneurs are finding a new niche in start-ups. A financier says that a start-up renaissance could shrink America's record-high youth unemployment rate. Fred Wilson is working with a few companies that are in the middle of this start-up curve.
Red Tape Update: The Cost of Health Care Legislation
The Senate promises to act on a pending small-business bill, but the bill may not really beabout small businesses and a disagreement about the export bank has clouded the debate. A $109 billion transportation bill that would finance road and transit projects for the next two years is approved by the Senate. The Small Business Administration honors the nation's top small businesses as Chris Hurn lays out his reasons for not abolishing the agency. Is America overtaxed? The Internal Revenue Service offers new penalty relief and expanded installment agreements and special deductions for the self-employed who are paying for medical, dental or long-term care insurance. President Obama proposes a national network of manufacturing innovation institutes. A new study finds that regulations from the Obama administration cost $46 billion a year. Legal experts predict a Supreme Court win for the health care overhaul, and the Congressional Budget Office revises its cost estimates.
Marketing: Mom Goes Viral
An interactive ad shows different content to men and women. A father and daughter team up to sell furniture. I like these five wild ways to use 3-D printing. Tracy McGrady confuses everyone with his new daily deals site. Anna Farmery recommends social marketing the Annie Leibovitz way. James Hagerty's mom goes viral. Stephanie Sammons suggests four tips for creating a LinkedIn company page. Google Plus takes steps to further integrate with YouTube. Jeff Bullas shares 10 small-business Facebook page designs. Kendra Lee explains how to avoid wasting a prospecting call. Steve Reeves offers advice for selling around the enterprise gatekeeper. Lisa DellaPorta offers her process for screening calls. Rohan Gandhi says you can learn from people who unsubscribe.
Finance: Some Banks Fail the Test
Four American banks fail stress tests, and Christopher Papagianis shares three disturbing trends in commercial banking. The Fed plans to simplify rules for community banks. PayPal plans a point of sale devicefor small businesses. A warning about crowdfunding: companies that want to raise big chunks of money later on will run into trouble if they already have lots of investors who own tiny pieces of equity.
Around the Country: Hide the Tide!
Manufacturing grew in the Philadelphia and New York regions by the most in nearly a year. Why is Tide detergent being stolen from stores across the country? A South Dakota brewer is the state's top small enterprise. Bradley R. Schiller says California is a bad bet for business. Here are the five best states for women. A $900 million investment in infrastructure for Ohio shale gas reserves will produce 600 million cubic feet of gas per day. A Wyoming town goes up for auction. A gorilla goes on the loose in Alabama.
Around the World: A Vertical Greenhouse
The Economist's forecasters are predicting a difficult 2012 for many countries. Here's what America sells to the world. A vertical greenhouse could make a Swedish city self-sufficient. Brazil's new consumer class is flocking to American stores. Bright Simons explains what African entrepreneurs can teach the world. Runa Alam dispels six myths about investing in Africa. Google and Historypin celebrate Queen Elizabeth's jubilee. Despite trade tensions, American exports to China are booming. Robert E. Scott says the rich, hungry Chinese consumer is a myth. Mobile-only Web users account for more than a third of China's Internet users.
Boss of the Week
In 2003, Miguel Jimenez thought big and decided to try to supply bagels to the Studio Caf at the MGM Grand. Today, his small Las Vegas company, Bagel Bagel, provides bagels to 90 percent of the hotels on the Strip.
Ideas: Garbage to Gas
The call for applications is out if you want to be one of Ernst & Young's Entrepreneurial Winning Women. A scientist turns garbage into gas. A start-up pushes skinny, flexible silicon for solar, and the number of megawatts of solar power installed in the United States more than doubled in 2011 from the previous year. Franchising is expected to grow in 2012. The world celebrates Pi Day. LegalZoom announces its Start-Your-Business Month Sweepstakes. The small-business community Manta announces major enhancements.
Technology: A Cloud Warning
CRN lists 20 cool cloud infrastructure vendors, but there's a hidden risk of a meltdown in the cloud. Helen Bradley looks at Windows 8 for small businesses. An Apple fan learns five things from two months using Windows. Google's Android platform gets a new gateway into industrial networks and could outsell the iPad by 2016. Brian Barrett shares the biggest mistake people make about the iPad. New software translates your voice into a different language. Bob Cringely says to watch out for Amazon. A survey finds that personal devices can put company data at risk. Technology finally catches up with the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Paul Escallier explains how to increase your smartphone's battery life.
The Week's Bests
Way to Simplify Your Life. Jay Shafer says to think tiny: "McMansions are like debtors' prisons for the 21st century. Why pay for all that space that you're not using, for the heating and maintenance, if it doesn't make your life better?"
Trust Your Customers. Bob Apollo says we should do what we can to put the situation right: "As customers, we owe it to ourselves to keep our suppliers honest by regularly rechecking to ensure that they are offering us a fair deal. But the more important lesson is for us as vendors: it is in our best interests to ensure that our customers get a good deal. But it is also incumbent on us, when we do come across a problem with a longstanding customer, to trust their account of the situation and do whatever we can to put the situation right."

HEADLINE: I Get By With a Little Help From My Parents

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Nearly 1 in 10 American adults say they regularly receive money or financial assistance from their parents or other family members. 

 BODY:
Nearly 1 in 10 American adults regularly receive money or financial assistance from their parents or other family members, according to a poll conducted by the Pew Research Center. 
As you might expect, the youngest Americans are most likely to rely on the family for social assistance. More than a third of respondents 18 to 24 years old are in that camp:
The poll found no differences in financial reliance on family by gender or race. 
It also found that among the young, those who work full time are among the least likely to receive money from their parents. That makes sense - young people who are working full time probably do so because they have no other choice. Many of those who are not working full time are in school, and they're able to go to school because they have a financial support system.

HEADLINE: Rendezvous Always Knew 'Bilinguals Are Smarter'

BYLINE: MARCUS MABRY


HIGHLIGHT: Of course, we already knew this. But it was nice to have an article in The New York Times Sunday Review confirm it. But that's not why I'm raising my kids trilingual. 

 BODY:
PARIS - Of course, we already knew this, those of us who are bilingual: We are smarter than other people. 
Still, it was nice to have an article in The New York Times Sunday Review confirm it:
"Being bilingual, it turns out, makes you smarter. It can have a profound effect on your brain, improving cognitive skills not related to language and even shielding against dementia in old age," Yudhijit Bhattacharjee wrote.
"The collective evidence from a number of such studies suggests that the bilingual experience improves the brain's so-called executive function - a command system that directs the attention processes that we use for planning, solving problems and performing various other mentally demanding tasks."
An article in August 2010 quoted Ellen Bialystok, a noted neuroscientist and the author of "Bilingualism in Development: Language, Literacy and Cognition," stating bluntly that bilingualism "doesn't make kids smarter." 
"There are documented cognitive developments," she said, "but whatever smarter means, it isn't true."
I choose to believe Yudhijit because my children have had a Mandarin-speaking nanny since they were four months old, even though neither I nor my partner - both Americans - speak Chinese. 
And I have only spoken French to the children since they were born, though I'm from New Jersey.
Let me explain. 
I never actually thought my children's being multilingual would make them smarter. (And I'm still not sure. Like Dr. Bialystok, I think there are a lot of ways to measure "smart.")
But long before I had children I decided that they would speak a foreign language if I had anything to do with it. 
For me, it just made sense in our globalized world. From a purely practical point of view, by the time my children graduate from high school, China will probably have the largest economy in the world. (When I told DealBook editor at large Andrew Ross Sorkin my reasoning, he looked into getting his kids a Chinese nanny, too.) We are not alone among New Yorkers - or even Americans!
I once tried to embark on learning Chinese, but one course in college taught me how unlikely that dream was. On the other hand, experts said that if my children heard Chinese all their lives (and we will immerse them in it whenever and wherever we can), then there was an excellent chance that they would speak the language. 
The other reason I wanted my children to speak another language, or two, was the joy I took from becoming fluent in French. As a poor kid from Trenton, learning French changed my life. 
But whatever your background, or language, the benefits of speaking more than one are obvious. You have to do nothing more than read "La Peste," Albert Camus's novel, "The Plague," in English translation and read it in the original to see that what is lost in translation: everything. 
Or ride a Paris subway, or fight with a French cab driver, or any number of other pursuits, and you will find that they are far finer when done in the original.
I wanted my children to have those gifts: the gift of the author's original words, and the gift of communication and understanding across geographic borders.
Of course, I always say, "Le franais c'est pour s'amuser, le chinois c'est pour travailler." French is for fun, Chinese is for work. 
The odds are, that will be the reality of the global economy in the middle of the 21st century, where my children will work. 
But - right now at least - I can honestly say it doesn't matter to me if my one of children uses his Chinese to become a busker in the Shanghai subway or the C.E.O. of a multinational corporation. Though, I suppose this may change . . . 
Likewise, I assume there are many Mandarin speakers who would say there is just as much fun to be had in Chinese as there is in French. 
What do you think? Are bilinguals "smarter," and what does that mean? How are you handling raising multilingual children? And are there drawbacks as well as benefits?

HEADLINE: Times Square Lights Up City's Economy, Study Finds

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: Many New Yorkers may like to complain about tourist-choked Times Square, but the neighborhood has become a vital commercial cog. 

 BODY:
Times Square may be the place hardened New Yorkers go out of their way to avoid, but its importance as a magnet for commerce as well as tourists has risen rapidly in the last few years, according to a study to be released this week.
 The Times Square district directly and indirectly contributes one-tenth of all of the jobs in the city and $1 of every $9 of economic activity, says the study, which was commissioned by the Times Square Alliance, the de facto chamber of commerce for the district. That amounts to $110 billion in annual economic activity - about equal to the output of Portland, Ore. - emanating from the district, which the report defines as roughly a block on each side of Broadway between 40th and 53rd Streets.
 How could so much of the economy of the nation's biggest city depend on an area that occupies less than 1 percent of its land?
 Just look up, says Tim Tompkins, the president of the alliance. Not at the 230 electronic signs that have long been the hallmark of Times Square, but at the buildings that many of them adorn. 
They are not just hotels, but also giant office towers that house companies where tens of thousands of lawyers, accountants, editors and bond traders work. Those companies buy goods and services from other businesses throughout the city and employ people who take their pay home to apartments and houses in other boroughs.
 In all, about 170,000 people work in the district, and most of them - 61 percent - live in northern Manhattan, another borough of the city or the suburbs. The rest live in Manhattan below 110th Street. But the money earned and spent in Times Square supports 215,000 jobs elsewhere in the city, according to the study, conducted by HR&A Advisors.
 "What's significant about Times Square is that it has become more diversified," Mr. Tompkins said. "Certainly we've become a major commercial office district. Until I saw that we have 29 million square feet of office space, I didn't realize just how much. Before, we were an entertainment and hotel district."
 Of course, the Times Square area has been cleaning up its act for much of the last two decades. But Mr. Tompkins said the study showed that the transformation was nearly complete. In addition, he said, it proves the value of tourism as a main component of the city's strategy to develop its economy. 
 "In the same way that we were a postcard for why not to come to New York City 20 or maybe 30 years ago,'' Mr. Tompkins said, "we are a powerful advertisement for how appealing the city is now." 
 Rosemary Scanlon, an economist who has lived in the city since 1969, said the numbers seemed plausible because the area was filled with tourists. Ms. Scanlon, the interim dean of the Schack Institute of Real Estate of New York University two blocks from Times Square, said that earlier studies had shown that people who came to the city for Broadway shows and museums stayed two nights or more, on average, and spent significant sums while in the city.
 She said the effects of the transformative power of redevelopment may be most visible west of Times Square, where Larry Silverstein and other developers have built luxury apartment towers in places where no market for them previously existed. (The study gives Times Square credit for spawning all of that construction.)
 But the most convincing evidence Ms. Scanlon offered was the newfound respect paid by New Yorkers. "I'm hearing people saying, I know this sounds nuts, but I had some out-of-town visitors and I took them to Times Square," she said. "I find myself saying, I want to walk you down there and I want you to see this."

HEADLINE: The New Suburban Poverty

BYLINE: LISA MCGIRR


HIGHLIGHT: How will the decline of living standards in certain suburbs affect national politics? 

 BODY:
In many of America's once pristine suburbs, harbingers of inner-city blight - overgrown lots, boarded up windows, abandoned residences - are the new eyesores. From the Midwestern rust-belt to the burst housing bubbles of Nevada, California and Florida, even in small pockets of still affluent regions like Du Page County, Ill., the nation's soaring poverty rates are visibly reclaiming last century's triumphal "crabgrass frontier." In well-heeled Illinois towns like Glen Ellyn and Elgin, unkempt, weedy lawns blot the formerly manicured, uniform and tidy landscape.
The Brookings Institution reported two years ago that "by 2008 suburbs were home to the largest and fastest growing poor population in the country." In the previous eight years, major metropolitan suburbs had seen poverty rates climb by 25 percent, almost five times faster than cities. Nationwide, 55 percent of the poor living in the nation's metropolitan regions lived in suburbs.
To add insult to injury, a new measure to calculate poverty - introduced by the Census Bureau just last year - darkens an already bleak picture: nationally, 51 million households had incomes less than 50 percent above the official poverty line, and nearly half of these households were in suburbs.
Why is poverty soaring in the suburbs? Part of the answer, according to the Brookings Institution, is simple demographics: More Americans live in the suburbs, so there are more poor people there, too. But the recent downturn has also had an outsize impact on suburbs, with the decline in certain categories of jobs and an end to the housing boom that drew many urbanites and immigrants to the suburbs in the first place.
While suburbs have always been more diverse economically and culturally than popular imagination would have it, soaring poverty rates threaten the very foundations of suburban identities, suburban politics and the suburb's place in the nation's self-image. "Keeping up with the Joneses," the midcentury caricature of suburban conformity, materialism and consumption has given way to a new suburban normal of making ends meet, with many formerly middle-class families in detached single-family homes struggling to pay mortgages and utility bills, and to repair aging cars. 
As these residents increasingly turn for help to packed local food pantries and crowded county welfare offices, their sense of their own identity and that of the suburbs where they live is itself being transformed. It won't be long before the politics of suburban living change too.
The climbing rates of suburban poverty mark a definitive end to the Fordist model of mass production and consumption, and its most internationally recognized poster child: homogeneous middle class families cradled safely in ever expanding suburban developments. To be sure, this now quintessential form of American living - tract subdivisions distant from work, shopping and urban amenities - was itself once an American novelty. 
The public infrastructure built during the New Deal, World War II and the cold war transformed the nation's built environment. That part of the story is familiar. Government highway programs significantly shortened travel times from surrounding urban centers. Developers leveraged cheap mass-building techniques, G.I. loans to returning veterans, and Federal Housing Authority programs to conjure subdivisions in farm fields from Levittown, N.Y. to Anaheim, Calif. Working-class men and women could purchase homes with government-backed low-interest mortgages; loans to veterans required no down payments.
These subsidized opportunities increased the number of American homeowners from 40 percent in 1940 to 62 percent in 1960. The suburban share of the nation's population grew from a mere 7 percent in 1910 to 32 percent by 1960. By 1970, the Census Bureau declared that the United States had "become a nation of suburbs." By then, suburbs in metropolitan areas surpassed central cities and non-metro areas in population.
The rapid growth, particularly coupled with the population shift to the Sun Belt in the last third of the 20th century, had weighty political implications. It incubated a distinctive variant of conservative politics and built a class of middle-income voters that has tended to favor the Republican Party.
America's postwar identity was deeply rooted in this upwardly striving suburban idyll. In reality, of course, American suburbs never realized this golden vision. These communities have always been socio-economically diverse, socially stratified and sites of downward as well as upward mobility. Still, during the economic expansion of the half-century after World War II, poverty, at least so it seemed, was somebody else's problem - and that someone was perceived as urban and non-white.
Indeed, in 1962 Michael Harrington argued in "The Other America" that poverty survived amid broad prosperity precisely because it was invisible to most Americans. "Living out in the suburbs," Harrington declared, in what now seems like quaint nostalgia, "it is easy to assume that ours is, indeed, an affluent society." Americans, he suggested, no longer saw poverty just "on the other side of the tracks" in their towns and small cities, but as a distant problem of the inner city, glimpsed only fleetingly from commuter trains or highway traffic.
The conceit that poverty is a problem suffered by other - often less deserving - people was an essential part of suburban self-identity that was reflected in its politics. Better-heeled suburban schools, sports teams and private recreation contributed to an ethos that emphasized family residential security, individual meritocracy and private life. Its inhabitants conveniently forgot that their cherished neighborhoods were in fact dependent on the programs of the New Deal state, not to mention the federal residential security maps that privileged white Americans.
Out of this unusual cocktail of state welfare and private speculation emerged a status-quo reinforcing preservationist politics caught in the acronym, Nimby (Not in My Backyard.) The California tax revolt in the 1970s was the quintessential expression of this, an effort to contain city, county and state spending deemed parasitical on suburban tax bases. Never mind that California's Proposition 13 crippled municipalities' abilities to raise property taxes and the state's capacity to raise income to finance essential public services. Proposition 13 and its ilk won widespread support nationally because suburbanites self-identified as producers, not recipients, of services.
In 1980, Ronald Reagan rode this ethos to the presidency and launched a broader attack on the New Deal state itself. Despite the many signs that the golden age of suburbs has passed, its political legacy continues to animate elements of popular conservatism, especially through the anti-tax elements of the Tea Party.
Could the rising tide of suburban poverty threaten the core assumptions of suburban life? Many suburbanites will no longer be able to insulate themselves from problems they used to associate with the inner city: poverty, social disorder, drugs and violence. What will this mean for the new suburban poor, for suburban municipalities and for the United States?
At the most basic level, poor people living in suburbs face challenges gaining access to services they need, because the municipalities they live in are unaccustomed or even hostile to providing them, or are simply unable to do so. Suburbs, with their thin safety nets, are not well equipped to handle the rising demands for help. Local food pantries in suburbs across the nation are stretched beyond capacity to meet the needs of the new poor. The Parma Heights Food Pantry in Ohio served thirty-six families in 2007 and now must meet the needs of 260 families. In El Paso, Colo., county workers have taken to working nights and Saturdays to meet exploding demands for aid.
The suburban poor also face the geographic challenges of decentralized living. Car ownership is a costly, brittle lifeline in suburbs with weak public transport networks. Budget cuts often target public transportation first, hindering access to jobs, as well as services. Suburban poverty also throws into bold relief the environmental burden of the suburbs; poor people are faced with the challenge of heating and lighting spacious but energy-inefficient single-family homes.
Chances are, however, that suburbs facing the highest burdens of the new poverty will be least able to meet them because of the economic recession and the spatial retreat of the better off. Just as many white Americans fled the cities for the suburbs in the 1960s, leaving the cities behind with declining tax revenues and fewer job opportunities, there is new cycle of exodus of the well-to-do from inner-ring metropolitan suburbs. As the better-off retreat, the provision of amenities and essentials from parks to schools to garbage pickup, heavily funded by property taxes, are bound to flounder for those left-behind.
One recent study conducted by Sean Reardon and Kendra Bischoff of Stanford University documented the spatial sorting by income that is going on, with the wealthy flocking together in new exurbs as well as gentrifying pockets of urban centers. In 1970 - the high-water mark of a more homogeneous suburban America - only 15 percent of families in metropolitan areas lived in socio-economically segregated neighborhoods categorized as affluent or poor. In 2007, that figure was 31.7 percent.
The replacement of America's middle-class suburbs, however flawed, by wealthier exurbs and secondhand suburban remnants is a leading symptom of America's 21st-century reinvention as a society of stark class divisions, spatial segregation and inherited social status. It will take bold politics to reverse trends like these, including higher taxes on the national, state and local levels to meet the needs of the poor spread out in these fractured, isolated communities. 
It is not likely that the 2012 election will be the terrain of the bold, although President Obama's proposal for tax increases on the wealthy is a step in the right direction. At this point, the festering pain in suburbia may not translate into suburban support for increased public revenues and spending. But as suburbs redefine themselves to grapple with the reality of poverty in their midst, public solutions will likely find growing appeal in places whose voters have historically favored fiscal conservatism.
Generally speaking, the suburban voter of the past has tended to vote Republican in national elections. The new suburban poverty may well remake those politics. A recent survey by the National Center for Suburban Studies found that 59 percent of suburbanites, while skeptical of Obama's performance and deeply dissatisfied with their personal economic circumstances, favored raising taxes on the wealthy. Obama's recent pledges to build a "fairer" nation and to level the playing field in favor of poor and middling Americans may resonate with struggling suburban residents.
The new poverty may well loosen the suburbs' historic ties to the Republican Party with its emphasis on individualist solutions. Looking toward the future, the new suburban poverty should sound an alarm bell that the suburban "way of life" itself may be better suited to an era now past. It suggests that we should rethink public policies that have long favored homeowners and decentralized living.
Though politically difficult, in the long term public policy should seek to reshape the national landscape to prioritize denser forms of living. Many metropolitan centers, from New York to Atlanta to San Francisco, have fared better in this downturn. This may hold the key to future economic growth. We should take the opportunity afforded by our new consciousness of suburban poverty and push policy makers to encourage the efficient use of sustainable energy, better integration of public and private transportation, and to offer alternatives to home ownership as the signal achievement of the American way of life by taking the dramatic and long overdue step of abolishing the federal mortgage interest deduction. The American dream of suburban domestic bliss has been fostered by sixty years of public policy; a new American dream of sustainable community and solidarity in urban life is also within reach, if public policy once again lends a hand.

HEADLINE: The Uses of Polarization

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: As the electorate becomes more ideological, the balancing act for presidential candidates gets harder. 

 BODY:
A primary goal of a presidential campaign is to incrementally increase margins of support among volatile and persuadable demographic groups like single women angered by attempts to restrict access to contraception or voters with long commutes worried about gas prices.
A second goal is increase turnout among supportive voting blocs - conservative whites in the case of Republicans, African-Americans in the case of Democrats. This goal is accomplished most often with polarizing tactics like the exploitation of wedge issues.
The target constituencies can be huge - white men, Hispanics, seniors - or, with the emergence of sophisticated micro-technology, smaller slices of the electorate, ranging from laid-off manufacturing workers to women golfers.
This is not news, but how does such a strategy actually work? A source who was willing to be identified only as a Republican strategist with extensive experience in national campaigns described to me in an e-mail how he looks at an election in which there are no significant independent candidates:White Independents. G.O.P. needs to win by double-digits.Moderates. G.O.P. loses by 20 or less, you win, lose by 30 or more, you lose.Latinos - what percent of the electorate do they represent? What's the margin? Nationally, if Latinos are 8 percent of the electorate, and the Democratic-Republican spread is within 25 points [37.5 Republican - 62.5 Democratic], that's good. If in 2012, it's Latinos are 10 percent of the electorate, and the Democratic-Republican spread is voting Democratic 35 points or more [32.5 R - 67.5 D], that's serious trouble.White women. Win by 5 to 9 percentage point, you win. Break even or lose, serious trouble. Overall, in 2012, we are looking at the G.O.P. having to win white voters by +19 points if Latino composition unusually high.That actually means white men over 60 have to be huge for Republicans - and you can't let Dems make serious inroads among white women over 60.Downscale whites - Obama approval has to be roughly in the mid-30s and he has to get whomped - while white college grad job approval cannot be higher than the low 40s.Whites age 18-29 - you have to carry them. McCain lost by them 10 percentage points and he got totally swamped
While the thinking of professional operatives may seem cynical or excessively calculating, it is a key element of election preparation by both Democrats and Republicans.
Democrats, for example, consistently seek to raise turnout among union members, urban voters, Hispanics and, since the emergence of the gender gap in the 1980 election between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter, female voters.
In the 2004 election, the Bush-Cheney campaign explicitly sought to polarize voters to increase turnout among potential supporters.
Matthew Dowd, who ran polling and much of the planning for Bush, explained the Republican strategy in 2004 to me just after the election. "Most voters looked at Bush in very black-and-white terms," he said. "They either loved and respected him, or they didn't like him." In the face of this reality, "we systematically allocated all the main resources of the campaign to the twin goals of motivation and persuasion. The media, the voter targeting, the mail - all were based off that strategic decision."
Politically, the 2004 strategy was a striking success. Four years earlier, in 2000, when Bush campaigned as a "compassionate conservative" with the goal of minimizing polarization, he had not been so fortunate, losing the popular vote by a margin of 500,000, and taking the ballots of voters calling themselves "independent" by only 2 points. He won the Electoral College by a slim 271-266 margin (or 5-4, as some liberals like to say).
In 2004, Bush did much better, losing independent voters by one point, but carrying the Electoral College by 286-251 and winning the popular vote by 3 million. In other words, polarizing tactics that divide the opposition party, pitting pro-gay-rights Democrats against anti-gay-rights Democrats, for example, may have contributed to Bush's diminished support from independent voters. Those losses, however, were more than made up for by gains in turnout among voters already inclined to cast a ballot for Bush, but who needed stronger motivation to actually go do it.
The Bush 2004 campaign and its allies made heavy use of wedge issues - from stem cell research to attacks on John Kerry's Vietnam war record - to raise Republican turnout and depress Democratic voting.
The basic approach of building support among key demographics does not, however, always require divisive maneuvers. There are multiple ways to deal with diverse constituencies, including raising the numbers of ballots cast by members of supportive groups, suppressing turnout among hostile groups and keeping margins of defeat, where possible, to a minimum.
It is almost certain that President Obama will not carry a majority of white voters without college degrees, a basically Republican bloc. He can, however, try to keep his losses among these voters to, say, 42-58, instead of a more damaging 33-67 margin. The possibility of making gains with this group has been improved for Obama by the prospect of running against Mitt Romney, whose campaign has struggled in the primaries with this sector of the electorate.
The Obama campaign's attempt to cut into the Republican advantage among white working-class voters was on display last Thursday when Vice President Biden appeared at a United Auto Workers rally in Toledo. "Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich - these guys have a fundamentally different economic philosophy than we do," Biden told the cheering crowd. "In 2009, no one was lining up to lend General Motors or Chrysler any money or, for that matter, lend any money to anybody. That includes Bain Capital. They weren't lining up to lend anybody money."
Over the past decade, campaigns have been taking giant steps forward in their use of technological advances like microtargeting, improved analytical and statistical models and other data-heavy mechanisms, which they use to identify and locate key supporters and persuadable voters. Micah Sifry, co-founder of the Personal Democracy Forum, argues that Obama's aggressive development of predictive modeling, data mining, social networking and other fine-grained techniques may prove crucial. "If the 2012 election comes down to a battle of inches," Sifry writes, "where a few percentage points change in turnout in a few key states, making all the difference, we may come to see Obama's investment in predictive modelers and data scientists as the key to victory."
The power of campaigns to create and motivate new swing voters dovetails with the political strategy of driving polarization. Information science has geometrically improved the ability of campaigns to accurately identify specific voters who are angry or threatened and most easily motivated by hard-edged, divisive messages, on such issues as race, taxes, welfare and other hot-button subjects.
The key is that this technological innovation is taking place within the larger context of increased ideological consistency across the two parties. "Since 1960, the two parties have evolved from miscellaneous coalitions of regional interests spanning the ideological spectrum into two unified and ideologically coherent political parties, on the European model," Michael W. McConnell, a professor of law at Stanford University, writes. The Democratic Party was formerly made up of "two distinct and ideologically incompatible elements: a white, conservative, largely racist Southern Democratic Party, and a mixed-race, more progressive Northern Democratic Party," McConnell points out. Motivated by the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the two parties began to reconstitute themselves as consistently left and right, a process that continues to this day.
Bitter social, moral and cultural conflict has driven up turnout: as voters become more ideological, they develop a stronger interest in the outcome of elections, and a greater likelihood of going to the polls on election day. "Those Americans whose attitudes and behavior most closely reflect the ideals of democratic citizenship are the most partisan and the most polarized. In contrast, it is among the uninterested, uninformed, and uninvolved that moderation and independence flourish," Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University, wrote in his recently published book, "The Polarized Public."
At the same time, the percentage of the electorate that can accurately be described as independent - without partisan allegiance - has shrunk to about 7 percent, according to Ruy Teixeira of the Brookings Institution. While the importance of such voters has diminished, in a closely balanced contest these relatively uninvolved men and women have the power to determine the outcome: in the 12 presidential elections from 1964 to 2008, four - 1968, 1976, 2000 and 2004 - have been decided by 2.5 percentage points or less.
Perhaps the most important factor going into the 2012 general election will be the most difficult to gauge: the degree to which the candidates themselves motivate or turn off voters. A detailed analysis of the 2008 presidential turnout by Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, concluded that "when considering whether or not to support John McCain in 2008, a number of Bush voters decided, 'No We Can't.' The number of 2004 Bush voters who decided to stay at home, or to support a Democrat, in 2008 did not grab the same kinds of headlines as new voter stories, but they were a sufficient condition for Obama's Electoral College victory."
Democratic voter enthusiasm has been running well below 2008 levels, indicating that this time around, Obama faces a substantial hurdle in replicating the surge in turnout that helped propel him into the White House four years ago - although there has been some improvement recently. Conversely, Mitt Romney, the odds-on favorite to win the Republican nomination, has so far demonstrated little ability to inspire Republican loyalists, showing weaknesses similar to those that characterized Bob Dole's 1996 and McCain's 2008 campaigns.
The strategic choices facing both Obama, who has moved to the left in recent months, and Romney, who is well to the right of where he was in 2008, are not easy. Every approach presents significant dangers. 
In each of the 12 to 15 battleground states, from New Hampshire to Nevada, the campaigns will have to make a decision. If they choose to focus on the small fraction of independent or swing voters, then a more centrist strategy wins out; if they choose to galvanize the base, then a more ideological and polarizing strategy will dominate, putting their standing with independents at risk. But if they focus on their core voters, independents may be repulsed. 
As the electorate itself becomes more and more polarized, the balancing act gets harder and harder. In this sense, as each candidate seeks to incrementally increase margins of support among key constituencies and to intensify participation not only among "pure" independents but also among loyal voting blocs, Obama and Romney face the same problem.

HEADLINE: A Wall St. Firm Advises Greece, With Discretion

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: BlackRock is helping determine how much capital Greek banks need to raise in the coming months, a crucial step as Greece tries to fix its banking industry and its broader economy, but a risky one. 

 BODY:
ATHENS - In unmarked offices here on a dusty block choked with strip clubs and burned-out buildings, several dozen employees of a Wall Street firm spent months poring over bank loan portfolios as Greece struggled with its debt crisis.
They belong to what has become the go-to SWAT team in financial crises. Their employer, BlackRock, may be little known outside financial circles even as it manages a world-leading $3.51 trillion of assets, but the firm is exerting enormous influence as a behind-the-scenes adviser to troubled governments around the globe.
In Greece, BlackRock is helping determine just how much capital the country's banks will need to raise in the coming months. It is a crucial step as Greece tries to fix its banking industry and its broader economy, but the task is a risky one.
 Set the capital levels too low and financial firms may not have an adequate cushion to withstand further losses. Set the bar too high and the banks may struggle to find investors willing to come up with the money. In either situation, the government could be forced to step in with additional money, deepening the country's woes.
BlackRock knows the stakes. Along with Greece, the financial firm has advised the Irish government and the British Treasury. In Ireland, BlackRock's findings formed the basis of a bank's effort to raise an additional $34 billion. The United States Treasury hired BlackRock during the 2008 financial crisis to help value real estate and other assets the government was acquiring as it stepped in to bail out teetering financial firms like the American International Group.
The executive who leads these efforts, Craig Phillips, keeps a poster of the movie "The Exorcist" in his office, saying that he sees his job as helping governments and companies confront their problems. "We have been conditioned to be ultraresponsive," he said.
The appeal of BlackRock is that it has the size, systems and expertise to scour and analyze huge volumes of financial data quickly. In Greece, for example, it reviewed 10 million loans in about three months. Another attraction is that unlike other financial firms - say, Goldman Sachs - BlackRock is not known for making splashy bets that can land it in the headlines. It has largely flown beneath the public's radar.
Yet BlackRock is no stranger to controversy. In the United States, the firm - which makes most of its profits by managing money for investors, pension funds, endowments and other institutions - has been criticized for buying and selling some of the same securities that its BlackRock Solutions unit is valuing for the government. Few firms have such access to a vast amount of market-moving information, and that, some critics say, presents a potential conflict of interest.
"Imagine you consult with Greece and you see the inside issues and you realize with greater certainty it's going to go a certain way," said Robert Jarrow, a professor of finance at Cornell University. "How could you not make investment decisions based on that?"
Eyebrows were raised in Greece when the firm was approached to handle loan valuation work for a friendly merger in Greece between two banks it had just reviewed. BlackRock said it hadn't made a decision on whether to accept this assignment. Mr. Phillips added that the company had internal guidelines, which are in place to "manage actual and perceived conflicts of interest."
There is little disputing BlackRock's rise as one of the world's most influential players. During the financial crisis in the United States, the firm's chief executive, Laurence D. Fink, turned his Rolodex of contacts into a number of assignments for the federal government. Now, BlackRock Solutions logs revenue of $510 million, up from $198 million in 2007. It earned $17 million on the Greece project.
The call from Greece came during the last week of June. Over the last decade, the country had issued billions of dollars of sovereign debt, prompting a crisis that has crushed the country's economy, pressured its banks and rattled the European financial system.
To help stabilize the system, the Bank of Greece looked for a firm to review the loan portfolios of 18 financial firms. Bank of Greece asked BlackRock and three other firms, Blackstone, Oliver Wyman and Alvarez & Marsal, to submit a proposal on how each would go about valuing the portfolios.
While the other companies had analytical and restructuring credentials, BlackRock had an advantage in having just completed a similar assignment in Ireland. "They were the only company that had analyzed a banking system in the same period of time," said Charalampos Stamatopoulos, a member of the monetary policy council at the Bank of Greece.
News that BlackRock had been hired sent shock waves through the Greek banking system. Officials worried that local banks would have to raise significant levels of capital - as in Ireland - and put additional strain on institutions.
"We had heard about their work in Ireland, and their results caused a lot of panic," said Artemis Theodoridis, head of wholesale banking at Alpha Bank. "It was scary."
BlackRock faced a number of obstacles. This was its largest assignment yet - in Ireland it looked at just four banks. It was also the first job where staff members did not speak the language.
In a city at times rocked by violent protests, BlackRock sought a low profile. Employees were not allowed to carry or wear anything bearing the company logo. The firm hired 18 armed security guards to transport employees in vans or, in rare cases, on motorcycles. BlackRock even had a code name: Solar, leading some tenants in its office building to think the team was a solar energy company.
As part of the assignment, BlackRock gathered information on millions of loans and used the data to create a view of the loss potential on the portfolios. The banks set up data rooms for BlackRock and uploaded information, allowing the firm to see things like collateral and payment history.
BlackRock and the banks butted heads on some issues. For instance, BlackRock wanted to write all loans backed by third-party guarantees to zero, since they were riskier than those backed by collateral.The banks resisted, but "in the end there was no room for debate," said George Aronis, also of Alpha Bank. The loans were written down to zero.
Jessica Tan and Charles Hatami, two of BlackRock's day-to-day managers in Greece, said that they were surprised by both the quality of the data and the results. Most institutions, they said, did not lend recklessly, as the United States banks did during the real estate boom.
"The consumer lending market is relatively new in Greece, and they were disciplined in their approach," Mr. Phillips of BlackRock said. "Unlike other countries, the Greek consumer is not debt laden."
Maria Mavridou, alternate director of financial stability at the Bank of Greece, said that BlackRock's findings were likely to be released in the coming weeks by the government. The report will describe the current state of the Greek banking system and outline additional capital requirements.
"They didn't know anything about Greece, but they sure know data and what to do with it," she said.

U.P.S. to Buy TNT Express for $6.8 Billion | United Parcel Service reached an agreement on Monday to acquire TNT Express, a Dutch shipping company, for 5.2 billion euros, or $6.8 billion.
The deal, months in the making, would greatly increase the American company's market share in Europe and open inroads in China. The newly combined company would earn 36 percent of its combined revenue outside the United States, compared with 26 percent of U.P.S.'s current revenue, according to a statement from both companies.
The deal for TNT Express was sealed after U.P.S. raised its takeover bid to about 9.50 euros a share from 9 euros a share. It would be the largest acquisition in the 105-year history of U.P.S., whose biggest purchase to date was its $1.2 billion takeover of the Overnite Corporation in 2005, according to data from Capital IQ. DealBook 
Apple's Big Cash Pile: The Odds Are Against a Big Deal | The day Apple shareholders have been waiting for is nigh. On Monday, the iPad maker plans to say how it will spend its roughly $100 billion in cash.
Yet merger junkies are likely to be disappointed. As our colleague Nick Wingfield reports, analysts widely expect Apple to begin paying out a dividend to investors, as opposed to making some sort of blockbuster takeover.
Indeed, the way Apple is setting the stage for its announcement appears geared more for a dividend than a deal. The company's chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, and its chief financial officer, Peter Oppenheimer, are to host a conference call at 9 a.m. on Monday, signaling either supreme confidence that any sort of mega-merger will not leak until then or, much more likely, that they will make a less ostentatious corporate announcement.

HEADLINE: Arcapita, a Bahraini Investment Firm, Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The $7.4 billion investment firm Arcapita Bank, which owns the clothier J. Jill, filed for bankruptcy protection in Manhattan on Monday after it was unable to extend a $1.1 billion credit line set to expire next week. 

 BODY:
Arcapita Bank, a $7.4 billion Bahraini investment firm that owns the clothier J. Jill, filed for bankruptcy protection in Manhattan on Monday after it was unable to extend a $1.1 billion credit line set to expire next Wednesday.
Arcapita said in a court filing that it had more than $1 billion each in assets and liabilities. Besides J. Jill, which it purchased last year, it owns the likes of the Viridian Group, a utility based in Northern Ireland; Pods, an American storage and moving company; and the Falcon Gas Storage Company of Houston. It previously owned the retailer Loehmann's as well.
The investment firm said in a statement that its filing was tied to its efforts to renegotiate its loan facilities, which had run into difficulty amid the European sovereign debt crisis. Arcapita began discussions about its $1.1 billion credit line three weeks ago, hoping to extend it by three years, but could not reach agreements with "certain nonbank creditors."
 Now that it is in Chapter 11 protection, Arcapita is hoping to use American bankruptcy laws to complete the restructuring of its debt.
"This was a difficult decision," Atif A. Abdulmalik, Arcapita's chief executive, said in a statement. "But after lengthy review of all the alternatives open to us, there is no question that this is the right course of action, which we are taking with the support of the board."
Arcapita listed the Central Bank of Bahrain as its biggest unsecured creditor, with a $255.1 million claim. 
The company is being advised in bankruptcy by Rothschild and the law firms Gibson Dunn & Crutcher; Linklaters; Trowers & Hamlins; and Hatim S. Zu'bi & Partners.

HEADLINE: Rexnord Sets Price Range for I.P.O.

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: Rexnord, an industrial parts maker owned by Apollo, has set a price range of $18 to $20 for its I.P.O. At the midpoint of that range, that would value the company at $1.72 billion. 

 BODY:
After several aborted takeoffs over the last six years, an initial public offering of Rexnord Corporation is headed for the runway.
On Monday, the industrial parts maker set a price range of $18 to $20 for its I.P.O. At the midpoint of that range, that would mean an offering of at least $450 million that would value the company at $1.72 billion. 
The underwriters, led by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank, also have the option to buy as many as 3.55 million additional shares in the offering. Rexnord plans to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "RXN."
An I.P.O. is a long time coming for Rexnord, which is based in Milwaukee. In 2006, its parent company, then owned by the Carlyle Group, filed for a $400 million public offering. About a month later, Apollo Global Management agreed to buy Rexnord for $1.825 billion. (Carlyle had bought it from Invensys in 2002 for about $900 million.)
Apollo first filed to take Rexnord public in July 2008, but as the I.P.O. market seized up amid the financial crisis, the filing was withdrawn the following year. The company filed for its current offering last May. 
As a result of the offering, Apollo will reduce its stake in Rexnord to 69.1 percent from 93.6 percent, Monday's filing shows.

HEADLINE: Under Pressure From Regulator, MBIA Pays No Bonuses

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: After discussions with the New York State Department of Financial Services, MBIA decided not to pay Jay Brown, its chief executive, and three other senior executives cash bonuses or long-term stock awards for 2011, people briefed on the matter say. 

 BODY:
MBIA did not award bonuses to its top executives in 2011, but only after its regulator pressured the beleaguered bond insurer to withhold the payouts, people briefed on the matter said. 
Jay Brown, the company's chief executive, and three other senior executives, did not receive any cash bonus or long-term stock awards for 2011, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday. 
The decision by the company followed discussions with its primary regulator, the New York State Department of Financial Services. Mr. Brown and his colleagues concluded that "it was in the best interest" of the company not to take any bonuses.
Benjamin M. Lawsky, the head of the department, told the company that bonuses were inappropriate given the state's assistance provided to the company during the financial crisis, these people said. 
 A spokesman for MBIA declined to comment.
The clash over MBIA's bonuses - or lack thereof - is the latest dust-up in the debate over the government's role in regulating executive compensation, especially at companies that received assistance from the government during the crisis. Lawmakers and regulators have sought to rein in compensation at financial firms, blaming large incentive-based pay packages for the questionable risk-tasking during the market boom. 
Earlier this month, the regulator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac slashed salaries for the heads of the two agencies and blocked most executives' bonuses. Both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have floated proposals that would give them more oversight over compensation at financial firms.
In New York, the state attorney's general's office, where Mr. Lawsky served as a special assistant, has also played a role in scrutinizing bonuses paid by companies that received bailout money. 
Some compensation experts have criticized the regulators for insinuating themselves into compensation decisions rather them leave them to a company's board and its shareholders. 
"It's a messy situation," said Alan Johnson of Johnson Associates, which advises companies on their pay plans. "I'm not saying that the government has no role here, but these decisions can often appear haphazard and politically driven."
New York's clash with MBIA has its origins in 2009, when the insurance division of the state's financial services department effectively rescued the company. The department authorized a split of MBIA into two operations, separating its traditional municipal bond insurance business from its crippling exposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities. 
MBIA, which is based in Armonk, N.Y., has been mired in litigation ever since that controversial restructuring. A group of banks sued the insurer, accusing it of fraud when it restructured. MBIA has also filed several lawsuits, including an action against Bank of America and its Countrywide unit, claiming that they lied to MBIA about the quality of the mortgages that were bundled into securities that the company insured. 
New York's financial services department has helped broker settlements with some of the banks that sued MBIA, including a pact with Morgan Stanley in which the bank received a $1.1 billion payment from the insurer. 
The department began reviewing the bonus issue while engaged in those settlement discussions, say people familiar with the matter. Mr. Lawsky took the view that the state's approval of MBIA's split, and the department's work to protect the insurer's policyholders, was not meant to enrich company management, these people said. 
Executives at MBIA were paid bonuses in 2009 and 2010, according to securities filings. Mr. Brown, the chief executive, received $1.8 million last year as part of a non-equity incentive plan, and about $4.5 million in awards and incentive payments the year before. 
MBIA initially resisted the state's recommendation to abandon bonuses, but eventually capitulated, these people said. But in Monday's securities filing, MBIA hinted at its disappointment with the state's interference with how much it paid its executives. 
The decision to withhold bonuses, said the company, "introduces the risk that our compensation program will no longer be effective in meeting our objectives" of attracting and retaining employees. 
MBIA added that while the board's compensation committee supported the executives' decision, "this was not a reflection of the compensation's committee's views of their individual performances for 2011."
